<h1>Former Bakery Leader Accused of Saying &#8216;White People Are Devils&rsquo; After 2007 Killing</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Josh Richman and Thomas Peele, Mercury News, May 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The July 2007 slaying of Michael Wills, in which two members of Your Black Muslim Bakery have been charged, was tinged with racial overtones, yet those men aren&rsquo;t charged with a hate crime.</p>
<p>Friends and relatives of Wills, who was white, are concerned that prosecutors haven&rsquo;t done all they can against defendants Yusuf Bey IV  &mdash;  the last leader of the now-defunct bakery  &mdash;  and Antoine Mackey, one of Bey&rsquo;s followers charged with pulling an assault rifle&rsquo;s trigger to end Wills&rsquo; life.</p>
<p>But experts say hate-crime cases are particularly difficult to prove and, in this case, would not bring added potential penalties beyond what the defendants already face.</p>
<p>Devaughndre Broussard, another Bey IV follower who has admitted to killing journalist Chauncey Bailey, told a prosecutor in March that Bey IV and Mackey bragged they killed Wills because of his race. The two saw him walking in North Oakland as they were discussing a string of racially motivated murders in the 1970s known as the Zebra killings.</p>
<p>&#8220;They was laughing about and joking about,&#8221; Broussard said of Bey IV and Mackey.</p>
<p>Mackey &#8220;said he seen the white dude walking down the path &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then he shot him,&#8221; Broussard added.</p>
<p>Bey IV later said, &#8220;&#8216;We got a devil. White people are devils,&rsquo;&#8221; according to Broussard&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<p>Then Broussard said Bey IV talked about &#8220;a devil mentality. A black man can be a devil if he&rsquo;s against his people.&#8221; Bey IV and his late father, bakery founder Yusuf Bey, have often, while preaching, referred to white people as &#8220;devils.&#8221; And in telephone calls recorded from the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin and obtained by the Chauncey Bailey Project, Bey IV often made similar statements, referring to &#8220;white and Jew devils&#8221; and &#8220;media devils&#8221; whom he claims are trying to destroy him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Patrick Wills, the victim&rsquo;s younger brother, said his brother&rsquo;s family and friends &#8220;pretty much all feel the same. Everybody knows the only reason (Michael Wills) was shot was because he was white. So I don&rsquo;t see any reason why that (hate crime enhancement) should not be part of the charges. For it to not to be there is horrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Prosecutors tend to be very hesitant to charge hate crime cases &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.because they&rsquo;re really, really hard to prove: You have to prove the offender&rsquo;s motive beyond a reasonable doubt,&#8221; explained Associate Professor Phyllis Gerstenfeld, a hate-crime expert who chairs the criminal justice program at Cal State, Stanislaus. &#8220;Hate crimes are the only criminal acts that require you to prove motive beyond a reasonable doubt &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we can&rsquo;t read people&rsquo;s minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>California law requires that someone convicted of first-degree murder that is a also hate crime be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. The law also says one of the &#8220;special circumstances&#8221; that make murder defendants eligible for capital punishment is if the &#8220;victim was intentionally killed because of his or her race, color, religion, nationality or country of origin.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The California Department of Justice reports that although 1,426 hate crime events were reported statewide in 2007, only 443 hate crime cases were referred to prosecutors. Of those, charges were filed in 387 cases  &mdash;  330 as hate crimes and 57 as crimes not motivated by bias. And of the 241 cases completed in time to be available for the annual report, 110 were hate crime convictions, 103 were other convictions and 28 were not convicted at all.<br>

								<h2>DA Won&rsquo;t Seek Death Penalty in Editor&rsquo;s Murder</h2>
						<p>
							<i>AP, May 29, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Prosecutors will not seek the death penalty for two men charged in several murders, including that of an Oakland journalist, Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff said Friday.</p>
<p>Orloff said he&rsquo;s opted to seek life sentences without the possibility of parole for Yusuf Bey IV and Antoine Mackey. He declined to elaborate on his decision. Defense attorneys were told of Orloff&rsquo;s decision before Friday&rsquo;s scheduled arraignment, which was postponed until June 18.</p>
<p>Bey, the former leader of a now-defunct community group called Your Black Muslim Bakery, is accused of ordering the killings of Oakland Post editor Chauncey Bailey and two other men. Mackey, a bakery associate, is accused of being the getaway driver in the Bailey killing and being the shooter in another murder.</p>
<p>Bailey was investigating the group&rsquo;s finances when he was gunned down on his way to work in 2007.</p>
<p>Your Black Muslim Bakery, founded almost 40 years ago by Bey&rsquo;s father, Yusuf Bey, became an institution in Oakland&rsquo;s black community, running bakeries, a security service, a school and other businesses. But the group became marred by connections to criminal activity.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, former bakery handyman Devaughndre Broussard, 21, pleaded guilty to two lesser counts of voluntary manslaughter for shooting Bailey and another man. In exchange, Broussard agreed to testify against Bey and Mackey.<br>

		<p>Hate crime riders (add-ons to existing criminal charges, not stand-alone criminal offenses) might be hard to prove, but Official Oakland isn&rsquo;t exactly straining itself to prove hate.  If the race was the other way around, it would spend its entire budget for the next 100 years to find evidence of hate.</p>

		<p>This case has eerie similarities to the Zebra Killings. The white devil that was killed was shot from a long distance by an AK-47 assault rifle at 2 AM  in the morning.The Oakland City Council catered to them for years and even gave them money grants.I really am worried about all of the dozens of other offspring of the monster Bey&#8221;His family and friends feel the same way as he does about white devils&#8221;.That really disturbs me.</p>

		<p>And then leftists have the nerve to cite &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; statistics as proof that blacks are targeted more than whites.  This is just one of many many examples of how hate crime prosecution is rarely pursued against blacks.</p>

<p>Unless they&rsquo;re white, of course.</p>
<p>Has anybody EVER read a statement like this when a PHONY hate crime charge is placed against a white, because he was white and the victim blacks?  I know I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t see anything like this favoring whites until cowardly prosecutors are fearful that the white population will rise up and riot to protest such brazen hypocrisy.</p>

		<p>Hate crimes are hard to prove??? Only when it&rsquo;s Black on White, if any Black dies at the hands of Whites is automatically assumed it&rsquo;s a hate crime, even with no evidence. Again, there is no doubt that if the races had been reversed the perps would be charged with a hate crime and would be facing the death penalty.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sickened, but not in the least bit surprised, by this.  If there was ever an instance that fit the definition of a hate crime, this is it.  But, as we all know, the definition of a hate crime is that only whites are guilty of them, and blacks cannot be.</p>
<p>The Bakery and it&rsquo;s Nation of Islam ruling cabal have deep ties to Oakland politics, the Oakland Police Department, and to the City Council and Mayor&rsquo;s office.  It is not unlike the Warren Jeffs/FLDS/Colorado City situation.  It&rsquo;s hard to convince a government that is full of black nationalists (and their ethically castrated white counterparts) to take a stand against black racism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say that this is getting downplayed because of the BART shooting of a black thug by a white officer, but the truth is that it wouldn&rsquo;t have made much noise anyway.  Oakland is a racist city, and sadly the white officer will be sacrificed as &#8220;riot insurance.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Broussard cuts a deal and - for murdering a journalist and another person - will serve no more than 25 years.  Bey IV, who was allowed to talk to Broussard privately in an interrogation room by a sympathetic cop, will get off easily, too.  But that goes hand in hand with Bey&rsquo;s father - a child rapist - who was repeatedly granted free passes by the cops, and by his friends on the City Council.</p>
<p>I live in SF, and know many white people who live in Oakland.  I don&rsquo;t know how they do it.  I wouldn&rsquo;t pee on their sidewalks.</p>

		<p>The media and the left need to &#8220;prove&#8221; that Whites are racist, and non-Whites are the victims. &#8220;Proving&#8221; that will let them begin taking money away from Whites and others who worked at honest jobs to earn it, and give it to the democrats favorite victim group.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;he seen the white dude walking down the path &ldquo;&hellip; then he shot him,</p>
<p>But this does not constitute a &#8220;hate crime?&#8221; Kinda makes a person wonder just what a Black would have to do&hellip; to have it termed a &#8220;hate crime.&#8221; Oh, well! The double standard will always be with us. Maybe five thousand years from now, Blacks will have left their jungle mentality behind and start acting like normal human beings. We can always hope.</p>

		<p>I used to drive by this place frequently when I lived in the Bay Area.  I always wondered what in the world it was.  This was before I had my &#8220;awakening&#8221;  which just began with the big supreme court affirmative action cases.  Oakland was a filthy, nasty and hostile place to be for a white person.  A real example of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  Ugly, disgusting and dangerous. The sort of place Jerry Brown and Don Perata see as a shining example of what should be.  Yes there are a lot of black muslims in the San Francisco Bay Area.   </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t blame blacks for being angry. Whites sold them the stinking pile of manure called integration and diversity and the false promise of equality. Liberals whites to this day are the most segregated people in America. </p>
<p>To this day whites preach the diversity hogwash. What are blacks supposed to do? Believe this garbage? Of course they look for ideas that make sense on black terms. </p>
<p>Imagine how your average white liberal looks to your average black. The white liberal is spouting all the diversity, and yet they have a white spouse, white children who go to a mostly white school, live in a white neighborhood. Blacks see through this charade of white hypocrisy and self deceit. No wonder they think the white man is a liar and a devil.</p>
