<h1><a href="http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090612/NEWS0102/906130339/Taco">Taco Incident Under Investigation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Fischer, Cincinnati Enquirer, June 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Justice Department is investigating an allegation that staff at the Academy of World Languages, a public magnet school in Evanston, fed a Hindu man&rsquo;s son a beef taco despite knowing his strict religious prohibition against beef.</p>
<p>Calling it an &#8220;intentional act of religious bigotry,&#8221; Ashish Gandhi, of Kennedy Heights, said the school clerk took his son to the cafeteria in October and force-fed him the taco. The incident occurred in the midst of a long-running dispute between Gandhi and the school over his son&rsquo;s education and discipline.</p>
<p>In a written response to a Justice Department investigator obtained under Ohio&rsquo;s open-records laws, Cincinnati Public Schools admits the 5-year-old ate the taco, but denies violating religious discrimination laws. CPS declined an interview request.</p>
<p>The boy chose the taco himself, and the clerk was unaware of his dietary restrictions, wrote Gary Winters, an attorney for CPS.</p>
<p>&#8220;At most, there was an error made on a single occasion, for which CPS&rsquo;s personnel and administrators have repeatedly apologized to Mr. Gandhi,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gandhi has also filed a separate complaint with the Justice Department, alleging that the school system has refused to offer his son, who lived in India until moving to Cincinnati in 2007, services for non-English speaking students. That is also under investigation.</p>

		<p>I hate diversity!  You have to constantly worry about whom you may inadvertently insult on any given day in any given situation.<br/>
It makes life too complicated.  Let them go back to India.  In the US cow = food, if some clown thinks a cow is a god or reincarnated relative let them stay in their own country amongst their own culture.<br/>

That could also describe refusing to eat a beef taco - or a pork one, for that matter.</p>

		<p>Unforgivable arrogance.  Mr Ghandi comes here and demands that we conform to his ways, and extend special privileges to his kid.  That&rsquo;s what we get for allowing the caste system into this country.  We are dirt, and Mr Ghandi is next to God.  Unforgivable. </p>

<p>So we have illegals coming into the country by the boatload, we have Muslims operating in Mosques as virtual organized crime syndicates and this is what the federal Government investigates?<br/>
For a taco? This is the clear insanity of multiculturalism.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;d be more outraged that someone force-fed my child at all, regardless of what they fed him. If the kid was force-fed vegetable Tandoori, would his father have no complaint?   </p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t hard to understand who is telling the truth here.  These third worlders see a chance to get some money from whitey, so they&rsquo;ll be going to court.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just surprised they didn&rsquo;t claim the kid was stretched out and tied to an ant hill while honey was poured over him.</p>

		<p>Why are we as US citizens allowing this PC diversity insanity to continue?  When will the people say enough is enough?</p>
<p>What has the USA gained from bending over backwards for immigrants (legal &amp; illegal) who don&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t assimilate?  Massive budget defeciets, damaged health care system, social security broke, state/county/city programs giving away the store while our very employment base is driven offshore by EPA, rules, regs and lawsuits, union/fed/state labor induced overheads.</p>
<p>You can blame the Progressive movement as instituted in large part by the Dem party.  Our country is shaprly divided, we are bending and breaking the constitution and diluting and losing the very values that have and will keep this country safe and prospering.</p>
<p>Enough is enough, across the spectrum from Obama, all of these hyphentated socalled citizen wannabees who act like we owe them something for being here.</p>

Does this fool expect people to believe that a school employee grabed his five year old son and attempted to FORCE FEED him the taco? <br/>
Diversity is stupid. Anyway I&rsquo;m off now to fire up the BBQ.<br/>

That used to be reserved for real crimes, not fake false phony cries of &#8220;I&rsquo;m offended.&#8221;<br/>
The &#8220;Justice Department&#8221; is investigating. Isn&rsquo;t that the agency that is supposed to  prosecute people for crimes? Why is it being used to promote injustices against innocent Whites?<br/>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe for one second the teacher &#8220;forced&#8221; him to eat a taco. If anything, the teacher likely just handed him the taco and he ate it or he picked the taco out himself and the father just wants to make money off of it.</p>
