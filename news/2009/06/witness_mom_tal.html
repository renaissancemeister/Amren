<h1>Witness: Mom Talked Me into Sex at Age 9</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Clark, Philadelphia Daily News, June 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A teenage girl testified yesterday that her mother and a male family friend urged her to have sex with him when she was 9 years old in an effort to lift a curse on the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was something I had to do to help the people I was close to,&#8221; the 16-year-old told a Common Pleas jury yesterday. &#8220;The way I understood was that if I didn&rsquo;t do this, bad things were gonna happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hector Ayala, 59, is charged with rape of a child and aggravated indecent assault in what allegedly began as what he said was a Santeria ritual and continued for years, eventually involving two of the girl&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s mother, whose name is being withheld to protect her daughter&rsquo;s identity, is charged with conspiracy, sexual assault and related offenses for allegedly persuading her daughter and being present during several assaults.</p>
<p>Under questioning from Assistant District Attorney Leslie Gomez, the girl said that she was 9 when her mother told her that she had the power to lift a curse on the family by allowing Ayala to have oral sex with her.</p>
<p>The girl said that the notion of a curse seemed real at the time; her mother had just lost her job and her mother&rsquo;s boyfriend recently had been sent to prison.</p>
