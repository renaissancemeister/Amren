<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Guinean citizens should burn any armed robbers they catch to avoid filling the country&rsquo;s prisons, the military government&rsquo;s anti-crime chief said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Lawlessness in the capital city Conakry has risen in recent months, with soldiers accused of being among the main culprits of robberies and rapes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m asking you to burn all armed bandits who are caught red-handed committing an armed robbery,&#8221; said Captain Moussa Tiegboro Camara, appointed by the military junta to oversee the fight against drugs and serious crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prisons are full and cannot take more people, and the situation cannot continue like that,&#8221; he told a meeting of city officials, adding that residents should form self-defense committees to protect themselves against crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rights groups were unhappy with Camara&rsquo;s suggestion on cutting crime.</p>

		<p>Burning one&rsquo;s arms is perhaps crass, but it&rsquo;s not so crazy when you consider the other extreme, that being St. Louis City.  There, 20% of first time adult armed robbers get only probation.  If St. Louis adopts the Guinea plan, it would be ablaze all summer every summer.</p>

A harsh as it is, this policy proposed by the military govt of Guinea is at least a more REALISTIC answer to a black crime epidemic than the catch-and-release/revolving-door paradigms currently in use by liberal criminal-justice systems here in the West. I&rsquo;m certain the threat of state-sanctioned burnings by citizens would make the country&rsquo;s armed-robbery rate drop dramatically. </p>
<p>One question, though: Is it necessary that the bandits&rsquo; death be by BURNING? With the price of gasoline these days, there must be cheaper ways to get the job done. And why should the govt care what methods are used, as long as the thieves disappear? The insistence upon making a bonfire of the robbers   &mdash;   as opposed to dispatching them with whatever&rsquo;s handy   &mdash;   sounds to me like typical bureaucratic interference and overregulation!  </p>

		<p>QD, I think he meant burn the whole criminal, not just his arms.  Just killing him (eg hammer to the skull) might be a bit more humane, but desperate situations often require desperate measures and burning would make one hell of a statement.  If it&rsquo;s statements that are sought, I personally prefer the Islamic approach: chop their hands off.  </p>

		<p>I think a better deterrent would be to make them look like Michael Jackson.  Turn them white I say.  Turn them white and then set them loose in society.  It would be a fate worse than death in those parts.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should judge or look down on the people of Guinea for this reaction.  People adopt methods of crime and punishment that meet their societal norms.  In white cultures, pathological, violent criminal behavior is rare, so we have developed a liberal criminal justice system based on jury trials, rules of evidence, and rehabilitation.  In third-world countries where violent criminal activity is more common, harsher methods are needed to address the problem (just look at Sharia law).  The problem in this country is that we have a criminal justice system designed to deal with white criminals but most of the violent criminals are black or mestizo.  Probation and short prison sentences are insufficient to deal with black and mestizo criminals.</p>

<p>Put me down as not opposed to initiating this policy in the U.S. too. I also think Pawn Shops should be illegal! ANYWHERE there is a Pawn Shop, home invasion, robbery, theft and such proliferate. One can sit outside of one for days and watch the steady stream of &#8220;usual suspects&#8221; bring things IN but NEVER pick anything UP.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s rather sad its come to this in any part of the world, let alone one where 1 in 3 people live in poverty. Poverty is a trigger for crime, that much is obvious. Burning was suggested as a method because it is rather commonplace in Africa as a form of execution (just as beheading and hanging were used in Europe and Asia), after all wasn&rsquo;t it Shaka the Zulu King who had 200 people burned after being revealed as fake &#8220;witch-sniffers&#8221;? The people who commit these crimes are either very desperate or very twisted. If the article was right in naming soldiers under the Government&rsquo;s employ as the main culprits, then I suspect the latter. After all, no one in their right mind would steal if they had sufficient means to support themselves.</p>

<p>Your contention that poverty creates crime is debatable.  I am searching in vain for the massive crime waves that became central Oklahoma in 1935   &mdash;   they were hit by both the Depression and the Dust Bowl.</p>
<p>I tend to think it&rsquo;s the other way around   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s not that poverty causes crime, it&rsquo;s that crime causes poverty.  This is true in both the practical definition (try getting a good job with a felony sheet), and the philosophical and general   &mdash;   who wants to lay down roots and invest serious capital in a neighborhood, city, country where it can be stolen or expropriated from you without a thought or care?  Insurance costs for a business in a bad part of town are higher, if you can get insurance at all, because you&rsquo;re sure to use the insurance.  Heck, a certain part of Oklahoma City, Okla. can&rsquo;t even sustain a pharmacy.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, all Chevy Corvettes were made in North St. Louis City.  Many of its parts were also made in nearby factories.  In the 1970s (?), GM closed that plant, built two new plants, one in Bowling Green, Kentucky to build the Corvettes, and one in (was was then) exurban St. Louis, Wentzville, Mo., so that the St. Louis GM assembly line workers could have another job, in that case, full size vans.  GM didn&rsquo;t go through all that expense for nothing, it was because the neighborhood got black, i.e. crime ridden.  Unfortunately for Wentzville, some of the GM workers that moved from North St. Louis to Wentzville were also black, and this created a mini-ghetto that still exists there to this day, even though Wentzville is now a solid suburb.</p>
