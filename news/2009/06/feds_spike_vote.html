<h1>Feds Spike Voter Citizenship Checks in Georgia</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shannon McCaffrey, AP, June 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department has rejected Georgia&rsquo;s system of using Social Security numbers and driver&rsquo;s license data to check whether prospective voters are citizens, a process that was a subject of a federal lawsuit in the weeks leading up to November&rsquo;s election.</p>
<p>In a letter released on Monday, the Justice Department said the state&rsquo;s voter verification program is frequently inaccurate and has a &#8220;discriminatory effect&#8221; on minority voters. The decision means Georgia must halt the citizenship checks, although the state can still ask the Justice Department to reconsider, according to the letter and to the Georgia secretary of state&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&#8220;This flawed system frequently subjects a disproportionate number of African-American, Asian and/or Hispanic voters to additional, and more importantly, erroneous burdens on the right to register to vote,&#8221; Loretta King, acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department&rsquo;s civil rights division, said. King&rsquo;s letter was sent to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker on Friday.</p>
<p>The decision comes as Georgia awaits word on whether a law passed in the spring that requires newly registering voters to show proof of citizenship will pass muster with DOJ. Under the law that takes effect in January, people must show their proof up front compared to doing checks through databases.</p>
<p>A three-judge federal panel in October ordered the state to seek Justice Department preclearance for the checks under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the same reason the federal agency must sign off on the new law that made Georgia only the second state after Arizona to require such proof. Georgia is one of several states that need federal approval before changing election rules because of a history of discriminatory Jim Crow-era voting practices.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Karen Handel blasted DOJ&rsquo;s decision, saying it opens the floodgates for non-citizens to vote in the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly, politics took priority over common sense and good public policy,&#8221; said Handel, a Republican candidate for governor in 2010.</p>

		<p>Of course not.  It&rsquo;s discriminatory not to allow dead cats to vote eight times in a day all for Democrats.  The only reason I think the Obamaheads in the DOJ are making a big deal at all about making Georgia back down is that they think it&rsquo;ll be easily flippable from red to blue in the near future, with all its immigration.  GA goes over 10 million people in the 2010 census, meaning it&rsquo;ll have about 20 electoral votes or more compared with the 15 it has now.  As it is, McCain only won GA by like 6%, his worst showing in the real deep south.  If a state like Oklahoma or Utah does it, the DOJ probably wouldn&rsquo;t care because they&rsquo;re very red.</p>

What else is new? We all know that there were tens of thousands of ineligible votes cast in this past election for the mulatto pretender. Anyone who is eligible to vote has a SS# and a valid Driver&rsquo;s License or State I.D. It is not a hardship if you are eligible to vote. </p>

Check out the DOJ civil rights division roster of attorneys. It reads like a roster of everybody on the face of the planet except Smith and Jones. My guess is that Loretta King is not white.</p>

<p>Erroneous burdens? Citizenship is not a burden to my way of thinking. And Georgia uses pretty much the same information that verifies that the welfare checks are going to the right person. Heaven knows there would be howling from the ACLU like we&rsquo;ve never heard before if any of those checks were ever &#8216;erroneous&rsquo;.  So where&rsquo;s the problem? Where&rsquo;s the proof? It&rsquo;s already less burdensome to register to vote than it is to file for welfare&hellip;much ado about nothing.</p>
<p>Well, not really &#8216;nothing&rsquo;, this is MALDEF and the ACLU after all. So its more about making sure the legitimacy and integrity  of the election process is undermined, and that those who are burdensome on the Republic, especially the illegals, remain a fully franchised burden into perpetuity. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t figure out the registration process or find it too burdensome? Common sense says such a person shouldn&rsquo;t be voting in the first place, and participation in the election process should have some minimal standards beyond having a pulse (optional for ACORN registrations). After all, what&rsquo;s the next &#8216;burden&rsquo;, and how low can the bar be set? Set the standards any lower and we might as well just do away with congress and run our nation based on internet polls.<br>

<p>I think blacks would be for these checks since the group that it effects the most is the group that is displacing and surpassing them economically. I don&rsquo;t expect blacks to think for themselves on this. They will let the federal judges, the DOJ, and the DA(Loretta King) do that for them. </p>

<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t say citizenship is the burden, just the voting registration process. And to be honest, they&rsquo;re citizens and we should let them vote. If we weren&rsquo;t happy about these people having a voice in government we should have a better look at who we let in in the first place.</p>

		<p>This whole thing is predicated on the fact that a significant portion of blacks do not possess<br>
something as simple as an ID. The reason for this is a large portion of blacks have had their IDs confiscated by law enforcement due to crimes commited.  </p>

<p>It seems to me that the topic is &#8220;the system of using Social Security numbers and driver&rsquo;s license data to check whether prospective voters are citizens&#8221;.  If it is determined that a person is not a citizen, that person cannot vote.  So, if a person is not a citizen, how is it that &#8220;to be honest, they&rsquo;re citizens and we should let them vote&#8221;???  It seems to me that there may be evidence of a reading comprehension problem here.  Your clarification will be appreciated. </p>

		<p>It appears the DOJ and Feds do not want voter verification.<br>
The citizen voters are being compromised by policies of the citizens government.  This is cover for voter fraud.  If a person can not ID themsleves at voting booths their votes may not be valid.  Check and verify to keep integrity in US elections.  Unlike other countries, USA was founded for citizens and the citizens are not subjects. Many countries and immigrants confuse the two.  I want integrity in the voting system.  V</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m tired of these kind of articles claiming that minorities in America can&rsquo;t get ID&rsquo;s.  Why not?  I never seem to hear the reasons for this put forth by anyone.  How do they survive from day to day?  ID is used for everything under the sun.  How do they apply for social/public services, cash checks, rent apartments, apply for jobs, etc??</p>
<p>Any legal person anywhere in this country can go to the nearest DoT/DoL, get a DL and/or a state ID card.  It doesn&rsquo;t cost that much.<br>
They really take us for stupid, huh?  </p>

		<p>That this is even a controversy is incredible.  Saying that proving their citizenship is too daunting for certain groups is tantamount to saying that they&rsquo;re too stupid to make an informed choice.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not what anybody&rsquo;s actually saying, since voter fraud is now such a large component of Democrat strategy that they&rsquo;re actively trying to institutionalize it. They&rsquo;d never win another national election without massive voter fraud, which is somehow viewed by authorities as a playful prank, unworthy of prosecution. In fact, it&rsquo;s the most direct assault on the integrity of the republic imaginable and should carry the same penalty as enemy espionage in wartime.  And the candidate on whose behalf the fraudulent votes were cast should share the penalty with the perpetrators.</p>
<p>I believe that would solve the problem rather quickly. </p>

		<p>I dunno &hellip;<br>
In Austria, if you want to vote, (regardless in which election) you have to be a registered resident of the precinct (not a &#8220;voter&#8221;). If you have several home addresses (which might &#8220;disparately impact&#8221; certain demographics) you get your card sent to the &#8220;main&#8221; address.<br>
Then you produce your card AND your passport (driver´s licenses are no longer recognized as &#8220;official ID&#8221;) to a board of observers of all parties, your name is stricken from the list, and you get handed your ballot. You retire to the cubicle, then drop the envelope in front of same observers, who also do the counting (together).</p>
<p>- I never heard anyone complain about the procedure (at times, there are problems with the absentee ballots, especially from overseas), though it may be a little cumbersome.<br>
I fail to understand how this could be a &#8220;civil rights&#8221; issue.</p>

		<p>I am beginning to see that asking blacks and hispanics to take any responsibility is asking too much. It seems they have been assisted so long they can no longer take care of themselves. It makes me very sad to see how they are killing whites and beating our children in public schools, while the leader of the free world goes around blaming our forefathers for every atrocity the world has experienced.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s all that Georgia is asking for&hellip;&rsquo;a better look&rsquo; into determining whether registrants are citizens or not. I disagree with the claim that the planned registration process is burdensome. Unfortunately, it seems more likely than not that ANY system that Georgia comes up with (DL, SS or ?) will be considered burdensome by someone&rsquo;s lawyers.   </p>
