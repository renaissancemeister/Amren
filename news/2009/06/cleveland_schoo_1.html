<h1><a href="https://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/06/cleveland_schools_tell_buildin.html#preview">Cleveland Schools Tell Building Program Contractors to Diversify Hiring</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Ott, Cleveland Plain Dealer, June 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Cleveland school district is bluntly telling construction companies that it wants more minorities, women and city residents working on a massive building and renovation program.</p>
<p>But if the companies fail to comply, officials say, the district can&rsquo;t force them.</p>
<p>When the district launched the $1 billion-plus program seven years ago, it called for minority workers and city residents to each handle a fifth of the labor and for women to get 5 percent. According to payroll reports, the first two groups have landed 17 percent apiece and women&rsquo;s share is 3 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But school board Chairman Robert Heard said the district, by law, can&rsquo;t enforce what are nothing more than goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t mandate to contractors who they hire,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can suggest, we can encourage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meeting was for invited contractors culled from school and city lists, Heard said. He said officials did not notify the community because they wanted to coax action without a debate.</p>
<p>Grace Waite Jones, an activist from Cleveland&rsquo;s Mount Pleasant neighborhood, learned of the gathering and came to give the district an earful. She said she had traveled past a couple of school construction sites and didn&rsquo;t spot a single black worker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Schools chief Eugene Sanders is trying to deal with contractors in &#8220;less drastic fashion,&#8221; Heard said. The board chairman said he is open to negotiating &#8220;project labor agreements&#8221; that would require unions to supply the workers necessary to meet the goals.</p>
<p>School officials have hired consultants to monitor contractors&rsquo; hiring and help the companies increase the numbers of residents, minorities and women they employ. The Project Group, a Cleveland company, will make frequent surprise visits to work sites under a one-year, $200,000 contract that took effect June 1.</p>

		<p>This type of nonsense has been going on for years. The companies will make a show of hiring some minorities and when the minorities get themselves fired for not producing, or not coming in to work, that&rsquo;ll be the end of it until the next time.</p>
<p>The point of a job is to get it done, and that&rsquo;s just <br>
not going to happen with a sizable amount of black workers. Even black people are aware of this. But they won&rsquo;t say it out loud of course.</p>

		<p>The only time I ever heard of the Federal judiciary ordering quotas for the sake of whites came from Cleveland.  They ordered a certain number of whites on every public high school basketball team in Cleveland.</p>

		<p>Hey, their right in line with Robert Reich&rsquo;s philosophy. That irritating idiot was worried not too long ago, that the &#8220;stimulus money&#8221; not be used to employ whites in construction. Good to know everything is proceeding smoothly in the new administration of &#8220;change&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Not a big surprise by any means.. I am a white unemployed engineer. I had to lie about my race to get an interview with a company that received my resume/application twice before. PS didn&rsquo;t get the job.</p>

		<p><i>She said she had traveled past a couple of school construction sites and didn&rsquo;t spot a single black worker.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d wager they were all latinos. Note that she didn&rsquo;t say she saw an overabundance of white people on the sites, just that there were no blacks. Anyone who&rsquo;s spent any amount of time working jobsites already knows why they aren&rsquo;t all that common.</p>

		<p>&#8220;She said she had traveled past a couple of school construction sites and didn&rsquo;t spot a single black worker.&#8221;</p>
<p>How could she possibly tell whether a given worker was black or not?  There are quadroons and octoroons out there who are indistinguishable (at first glance) from whites - and yet they are considered &#8220;black&#8221; by the powers that be.</p>

		<p>I get the distinct impression that there is a movement in progress to disenfranchise Whites? Refuse them jobs. Block college admissions, and if admitted, pay full tuition. Do you get that impression?</p>

		<p>This article is quite relevant right now. Tomorrow the U.S. Supreme Court decision on the New Haven firefighter case is coming out. As a nation, we have gone past the &#8220;Quota&#8221; stage. We still have quotas but they are called &#8220;Diversity&#8221;. On the story here, we need the First Lady to deploy her skills; her job was as some sort of Diversity Czarina in Chicago. </p>
