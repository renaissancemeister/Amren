			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Simon, Los Angeles Times, June 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Congress appeared poised Thursday to continue compensating state and local governments for incarcerating illegal immigrants convicted of crimes, ignoring President Obama&rsquo;s call to eliminate such payments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Senate Appropriations Committee voted to provide $228 million nationwide next year, acting a week after the House voted to allocate $400 million, the same as this year.</p>
<p>Once the full Senate acts, negotiators from both chambers will meet to reconcile their differences.</p>
<p>California, which receives about 40% of the money, still could end up with less than it received this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will try to persuade congressional negotiators to provide the full $400 million, said H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the California Department of Finance.</p>
<p>But Palmer said the governor still wanted to turn over some of the 19,000 illegal immigrants in state prisons to federal authorities for deportation to help close the state&rsquo;s budget gap.</p>
<p>California receives only a fraction of the nearly $1 billion it expects to spend imprisoning illegal immigrants this year. Los Angeles County alone spends about $100 million.</p>

		<p>Shuffling moolah from the federal printing presses to the states for the purpose of paying to incarcerate illegals only makes the problem worse because it removes any incentive for the states to deal with the real problem,which is the presence of the illegals themselves.Some states will do something about it, but others wont. And Governor Swartzamillions appears to be turning into a clone of John McKennedy.</p>

		<p>Labor forced upon the states by the FED in detaining, trial, and of course incarcerating foreign felons surely fits the definition of &#8220;involuntary servitude&#8221;. </p>
<p>Of course that is the just the term we be hearing if a mandatory work requirement were imposed on those jailed.</p>

		<p>On the bright side, if this money doesn&rsquo;t go through, they&rsquo;ll have to release jailed illegal aliens, at which time they&rsquo;ll be &#8220;deported.&#8221;  I.E. they&rsquo;ll be asked nicely with a cherry on top to go home, most actually won&rsquo;t.  Better to keep them in confinement than outside committing a crime against you.</p>

		<p>In a civilized society, incarceration shouldn&rsquo;t be dependant on budgetary availiabilty. If prison is neccesary it will be done regardless of funds. If the feds deny the funding then the illegals will still be held in captivity, only with less resources. eg: instead of regular prison they&rsquo;ll be on 23 hr lockdown (1 hour in the yard) with two enriched cornmeal based meals per day. No visitors, no legal, emergency med only, until release when they&rsquo;ll be promptly deported without appeal.</p>
<p>Of course this could have been avoided if when they were first arrested (which is usually within one month of illegal entry) they were immediately scheduled for deportation without appeal. -(I don&rsquo;t understand how illegal entry can be appealed anyway. It&rsquo;s like me going into a bank to withdraw $1000,000 and appealing when they tell me I don&rsquo;t have the funds)-</p>
<p>Why is this not the policy already? Or would that be just too easy?</p>

		<p>I agree fully. Enforcement of the law in this country should never be dependent on whose budget takes the hit. Should we stop enforcing all laws, except murder and treason, to save money? I can think of little else that would save MORE money than to remove and deport those in this country illegally.</p>

<p>RIGHT YOU ARE, if the fed is NOT going to enforce federal immigration laws then let&rsquo;s start up some counterfeit printing presses! bet the fed will enforce THAT law&hellip;it would cost less, help more people and do less harm to America than the illegals are doing.</p>
