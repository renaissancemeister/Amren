<h1>Race Critics: Capitol Hill Is Too White</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Eberhart, Newsmax, June 26, 2009 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s not enough racial diversity among the congressional staff on Capitol Hill and activists want corrective action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given such poor numbers, let&rsquo;s acknowledge that there is something broken about the process,&#8221; said Citigroup lobbyist Paul Thornell, a former aide to Al Gore and former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. He added that there are &#8220;few intentional strategies in place to promote minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a report in The Hill newspaper, there are two Senate chiefs of staff who are minorities. In the House, there are but five white lawmakers who have African-American chiefs of staff. Furthermore, only four African-Americans are staff directors of either House or Senate committees.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think people are out-and-out prejudiced or biased, but there&rsquo;s a lack of effort,&#8221; said Robert Primus, chief of staff to Rep. Michael Capuano, D-Mass., and one of the rare black chiefs of staff to a white member of Congress. {snip}</p>
<p>The solution, say critics of the status quo: fully embrace the so-called &#8220;Rooney rule,&#8221; named after Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney. The rule requires that NFL teams interview at least one minority prospect when filling head coaching jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s because there is a lack of African-Americans or people of color wanting to work on Capitol Hill,&#8221; Paul Brathwaite, executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus told Newsday three years ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At that time, the number of African-Americans, Latinos and Asians employed by members of Congress had crept up to roughly 20 percent, according to a study by the Congressional Management Foundation.</p>

		<p>I have worked a few years in the past on Capitol Hill. Not for a Congressman, but for trade associations. I was always impressed by the quality of the vast majority of staffers of either party. Even if I disagreed with their position, or they with mine, they were smart, articulate, good looking(male and female), often had humor, and knew the geography, history and culture of the United States. Almost(not all) of them were white, unless they worked for a black congressman or woman. </p>
<p>In my opinion, having dealt with many black young people since my years in political and lobbying work, most black college graduates would not have the qualifications necessary to deal as part of the House-Senate apparatus with the public, representatives of a vast variety of interests, and read and understand complex legislation and legislative reports. Black colleges like Howard or Morgan State are a joke compared with the hundreds of rigorous private and public colleges which supply the Hill, the members and the commmitte staffs with bright young talent. Remember, black colleges average dropout rates of 50% or more, and blacks drop out of majority white colleges at a much higher rate than whites. Genuinely qualified black college graduates are in huge demand; many go to Wall St or lucrative positions in law or business. The Hill is prestigious but starting salaries often are below 75 grand, a pittance for the few real black college grads from real schools, not slave schools like Tuskeegee.</p>
<p>And yes, these staffers, some amazingly young,  write said legislation and reports under the control of the Member or committee chair for whom they worked. </p>
<p>BTW, black members of Congress (all Democrat), in the House when I worked up on the Hill, had practically all black staffers(who were smart but utterly indifferent to white concerns). </p>
<p>I just thought a little historical perspective would be helpful.</p>

<p>Hey, <br>
just ask Sotomayor&rsquo;s clerks! (Maybe &#8220;Latina wisdom&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t extend to vital underlings?)</p>
<p><i>The solution, say critics of the status quo: fully embrace the so-called &ldquo;Rooney rule,&rdquo; named after Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney. The rule requires that NFL teams interview at least one minority prospect when filling head coaching jobs.</i></p>
<p>Really? So they won&rsquo;t be complaining when the proportion of &#8220;minority&#8221; staffers remains the same in a few years time, even <i>with</i> mandatory minority interviews?</p>
<p>This is how it will start - they will later &#8220;propose&#8221; mandatory employment of <i>at least</i> one &#8220;minority&#8221; staffer, from which they will move on to demanding &#8220;proportional&#8221; employment of minorities.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny that the same white Democrats and Republicans advocating the racial dispossession of whites in the U.S. will probably <i>never</i> see their children or grandchildren take political office, as the &#8220;minorities&#8221; whose interests their fathers and grandfathers so greatly advanced and pandered vote for &#8220;people who look like them&#8221; and staff other &#8220;people who look like them&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It will never be enough for these people until all white people are jobless and unemployable, just like the Boers of South Africa!</p>
<p>Here is a novel idea, hire the best person for the job. And apparently they did and that is why the staff is majority white! <br>

<p>How utterly laughable; the Congress critters who demand that we all bask in the &ldquo;strengths&rdquo; and &ldquo;enrichments&rdquo; of diversity, humbly deprive themselves of it?</p>
<p>Perhaps, they should all be forced into some sensitivity training and whatnot?</p>

The &ldquo;Rooney Rule&rdquo; is just a push to get the foot in the door. Many whites might say, &#8216;sure, interviewing a few blacks is a reasonable request&rsquo;. But it won&rsquo;t end there. Once they get the interviews, they&rsquo;ll question why blacks aren&rsquo;t being hired. Inch by inch. Step by step. It&rsquo;s a losing game.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m offended that Harlem is too black. I think that needs to change.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Congressmen must hire more non-white staffers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesh, like Jeb Bush did in Florida.  His requirement for staffers was that they be black.  Nothing else.</p>
<p>So when you got a letter from his office that sounded like it came from the third grade it was understandably an attempt to give blacks a chance to get out from all the oppression they have been enduring.</p>
<p>That they were completely unable to understand any aspect of anything complicated that you might be addressing didn&rsquo;t really matter to old Jeb.  I mean, after all, it wasn&rsquo;t HIS problems that were being dealt with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like government run healthcare.  The Congress refuses to participate in it, but they insist that we do.</p>

		<p>Write an article calling for &#8220;internal diversity&#8221;</p>
<p>Require that if the candidate is black, that they interview an asian first for the head staff position.</p>
<p>Does anyone think the staffers who happen to be White, were simply picked by skin-color alone?<br>
Or is the more likely explaination that they were their through hard work, intelligence, and working their way up the ladder.<br>
The bottom line is the staffer has to help the candidate get work done.<br>
They are there to do a job and dont need to meet any requirement to be of a certain race to satisy &#8220;racists&#8221; ( I mean &#8220;critics&#8221; as the article said.)<br>
Note - if you were to say &#8220;I want more white representing inner city areas&#8221;, like Washington DC for example * when was the last time Washington,DC had a WHITE mayor? *<br>
would the media call you a &#8220;critic&#8221; or would they call you a &#8220;racist&#8221; ?</p>
<p>It must be understood that the demand for black self-interest comes from blacks and white liberals that are really self-hating and anti-white.<br>
The demand that &#8220;Everyone disregard their own racial self-interest&#8221; only came from a past generation of white&rsquo;s that are no longer living, aren&rsquo;t in power and if we ignore them there will be no back lash against us.</p>
<p>Imagine a country that was 90% black and 10% latino.<br>
Say white&rsquo;s came as immigrants in sufficent numbers such that<br>
the new numbers were 80% black 10% latino and 10% White.<br>
Would Whites in that country then form a White Caucus to make sure that the representation in the Congress was &#8220;more diverse&#8221; {read more white in this case} ?<br>
Would Black&rsquo;s deny qualified blacks in this country their chance to be head of staff simply for being black?<br>
Or would they say that each is an individual applying for an individual position as an individual and not part of some type of quota?</p>

		<p>I completely agree. I am disgusted that the racist Democratic Party would have such a low percentage of blacks in positions of power. About 20% of the people who vote Democrat are African-American yet blacks are woefully under-represented. IT&rsquo;S SHAMEFUL!</p>
<p>The Republican Party, however, deserves a lot of credit. Their percentage of blacks is exactly proportional to the percentage of blacks that vote Republican.<br>

		<p>The fairly obviously reason for this is that Congressmen hire their staff out of their own district, rather than from the heavily black DC area.  So some Congressman from Montana is not going to be likely to have a black staff member.  Likewise, I seriously doubt Maxine Waters has any white staff members.</p>

		<p>I used to work for a member of Congress, and we made a concerted effort a few years ago to find a black mid-level staffer.  After a parade of interviews of clearly sub-standard individuals, we finally found a black woman who really did seem like she could do a good job.  We offered it to her.  Unfortunately, she choose a better position with greater responsibility and opportuntity for advancement working for a Senator.  </p>
<p>The problem is there are too few competent blacks.  And the ones who are competent command very high salaries and move up quickly.  </p>
<p>So&hellip;after months of trying, we gave up and hired a white person.  </p>

		<p>Are WE ever going to tell these people (blacks) enough is enough already, YOU are 13.5% of the population, where did you  get the idea that 50% is YOUR share? blacks are not the only (minority) as they call themselves and I feel that once the 13.5% level is reached (in all fairness) they need to step back and allow others to step in. By the way WHITE people are a relatively small percentage of The World Population, it just seems as if there are more White People because Much of Human Accomplishment come back to their brains, efforts and abilities..</p>

		<p>Gee, I think South Central L.A. is too black - what&rsquo;cha gonna do about THAT???  I think people on the Hill want competence, not color.  They choose the best and the brightest, and that&rsquo;s the way the cookie crumbles.  Blacks comprise about 15%, maybe 17%, of the population at large - and I would imagine that they are represented in about those percentages on the Hill.  And what about Hispanics and Asians???  Are THEY represented on the Hallowed Hill??  What are their percentages in the general population?  And how is it that only blacks are complaining?  Is that because it&rsquo;s what they do best, rather than producing anything valuable to the country?</p>

<p>Blacks are a luxury that Whites can no longer afford!</p>
<p>Remember Barrack looks good in a Bill Blass suit and can read a teleprompter well. He went to Harvard Law School [in a fashion] and is suppose to be brilliant. I didn&rsquo;t go to Harvard, don&rsquo;t wear Bill Blass, and have never read a teleprompter in my life. Moreover I have never had, nor would I ever want to have, a relationship with any woman named Oprah. That said, thirty minutes of a question and answering session with me would seem to him to have lasted thirty days. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Given such poor numbers, let&rsquo;s acknowledge that there is something broken about the process,&rsquo; said Citigroup lobbyist Paul Thornell&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a verbal method worth studying. To make a claim harder to refute, embed it as a presupposition. (&#8220;Do you still beat your wife?&#8221;) The &#8220;numbers&#8221; aren&rsquo;t &#8220;poor&#8221; as long as hiring is based on merit, but objecting to the speaker&rsquo;s implicit assumption seems like taking a detour. The sole purpose of this statement may be to allege that the numbers are poor and we all know it, and have that claim go unquestioned.<br>

After a few years of missing votes, proposing unconsitutional or improperly formed legislation, they will lose their hold on power for a generation or two.
