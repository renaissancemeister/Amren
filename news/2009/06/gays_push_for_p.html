			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew B. Stannard and Tyche Hendricks, San Francisco Chronicle, June 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As Congress and immigrant advocacy groups gear up for the annual tussle over comprehensive immigration reform, a proposal by San Jose Rep. Mike Honda is opening up a new angle on the debate  &mdash;  one that some groups warn could overshadow years of effort at building consensus.</p>
<p>Honda&rsquo;s Reuniting Families Act, introduced Thursday, would extend to &#8220;permanent partners&#8221; the same naturalization rights accorded to spouses under the bill, allowing gay and lesbian Americans to seek legal residency for their immigrant same-sex partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you define &#8216;all families&rsquo;? Traditional heterosexual families but also permanent partners, recognized as having a legitimate long-term relationship,&#8221; Honda, a Democrat, said this week. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a civil rights issue. The idea of being on the outside looking in is something we&rsquo;re familiar with, it&rsquo;s un-American.&Nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I want to make sure we do the right thing the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Honda introduced his bill, which addresses a range of other immigration issues, in advance of a White House meeting on immigration policy, scheduled for June 17, to which President Obama is inviting congressional leaders from both parties. Hundreds of immigrant advocates converged on Washington this week to show support for comprehensive immigration reform, including legalization of undocumented immigrants and an increase in green cards for family-based immigration.</p>
<p>But Honda&rsquo;s proposal to extend to same-sex partners the legal residency rights now accorded to spouses has generated controversy within the coalition of groups seeking reform  &mdash;  with some of those groups warning the issue could fracture the movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe it could be a death knell,&#8221; said the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. &#8220;We won&rsquo;t support legislation  &mdash;  period  &mdash;  that includes the Honda same-sex component.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops this week also criticized Honda&rsquo;s bill, saying that while it strongly supported reform to help reunify immigrant families, the conference strongly opposed efforts to &#8220;erode the institution of marriage and family by according marriage-like immigration benefits&#8221; to same-sex relationships.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We already know that in order to pass comprehensive immigration reform, we need to engage some of the Blue Dog Democrats, some of the centrists and the moderates,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we add on the same-sex component, many of the Blue Dog Democrats are going to say absolutely not, we&rsquo;re not going to sign on.&#8221; The Blue Dogs are a group of conservative Democrats.</p>
<p>Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors limited immigration, said Honda&rsquo;s proposal could also lead to increased fraud because same-sex couples don&rsquo;t have the same clear documentation  &mdash;  a marriage certificate  &mdash;  to prove to immigration officials that they have the relationship they claim.</p>

		<p>This is another good reason for being suspicious and hostile to Liberal activities and proposals. I had thought that same sex civil marriage was a harmless issue that made any no  significant difference to me. It was just a Liberal plot to promote some hostility between homosexuals and anti-homosexuals. Since I belong to neither group, I ignored it. Now, I realize its sinister implications: it can be used to open up the U.S. to even more millions of third world types.</p>

		<p>I could not bear to read all of this article. As a &#8220;gay&#8221; person myself (I really dislike that term), I wish they (these groups and politicians that claim to represent us) would not constantly push these issues. They&rsquo;re only stirring the pot unnecessarily. Who asked them to?  I feel an anger and frustration very much akin to those Jewish persons who post here who resent the actions of those groups that claim to represent them.  Personally, nobody speaks for me but me.</p>

<p>Must agree with the Bishops. But should the Honda measure gain any traction, and before we consider reforming our immigration laws any further, how about the partners involved consider emigration?  Unless there is another agenda afoot, it seems reasonable to expect those involved would be required to demonstrate that they have petitioned, and been denied,  residency by the alien partners country first. </p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Everything nowadays is being made a &#8220;civil rights issue&#8221;, since that has proven  to be such a successful umbrella to hide under.</p>
<p>They   &mdash;   the  Marxist liberal-minority coalition   &mdash;   are recruiting and dragging into their corner every conceivable special-interest  group that can possibly enlarge their numbers and be of use in pursuing their goal of  forcing the gates open ever wider with the objective of  dispossessing  and displacing white Americans. Gays in this case are being used as an excuse to accomplish that.</p>
<p>Also, as  pointed out, since there is no marriage certificate, there is no way of documenting a relationship. Since many relationships (even heterosexual ones) prove so transitory, how can one know if there isn&rsquo;t a new &#8220;partner&#8221; in another year or even another month?   And if the old &#8220;partner&#8221; is replaced, will he/she be required to return to the old country?   I highly doubt it.</p>
<p>Btw, I see,upon checking, that San Jose, California&rsquo;s third  largest city,  has only a 31% white (non-Hispanic) population.  That explains Rep. Honda&rsquo;s enthusiasm for increasing immigration in every possible way, and also his indifference to the interests of native whites.</p>

		<p>Hopefully Sen. Leahy and Rep. Honda have inserted a poison pill in the new amnesty bill. The bill they offered would allow American citizens and legal immigrants to seek residency in the United States for their same-sex partners, just as spouses now petition for foreign-born husbands and wives.  They are catching major flack from the Catholic church and many other groups that would normally support open borders.  It is also interesting to note that these Dems are attempting to open the borders to millions while the country is in the middle of a serious recession with jobless number approaching ten percent. It hard to believe what Bozos we have in leading decison making positions. </p>

<p>If he was an American he would push agenda that benefits the whole nation. Do not trust this hopeless fool, deport him back to Hiroshima.</p>

		<p>I happened to catch Rep. Honda&rsquo;s appearance on TV yesterday, touting this ridiculous idea. I&rsquo;m all for family and &#8220;partner&#8221; reunification too - in their own countries. This continued influx of people - both legal and illegal - is too much for this country to bear, especially in this difficult financial period. His timing is wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it. I&rsquo;m not familiar with this man. What is he hoping for? I&rsquo;ve decided that these &#8220;altruistic&#8221; politicians have three reasons for wanting more people in this country - votes, cheap labor and payoffs. Otherwise, why would they want to destroy their own country? None give a good reason. Surely they know we don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s done from the goodness of their hearts.</p>

<p>I wish someone would ask him this simple question, point blank, on television and put him in a corner where he has to respond.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, the Japanese are at it again, attempting conquest of California   &mdash;   this time by a new strategy which is proving much more successful than the old one.<br>

<p>This always puzzles me; Heterosexual people have done far more to harm the &#8220;institution of marriage&#8221; (it is not an &#8220;institution.&#8221; It is a legal agreement between two people regardless of what decorative overlay or religious pressures is placed over it).  People have been ritually pairing up since at least neolithic times.  Before Christianity took over in Europe, Celtic weddings were termed &#8220;Handfasting.&#8221;  But it is the behavior of irresponsible straights that have hurt marriage everywhere, not a handful of gays.</p>
