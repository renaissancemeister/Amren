<h1>William &amp; Mary Mascot Ideas Include an Asparagus</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia is looking for a mascot and ideas have ranged from a feathered horse to an asparagus stalk.</p>
<p>The school said Monday more than 400 nominations have been submitted. William &amp; Mary for decades was known as the Indians, but the school changed its nickname to Tribe in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The NCAA ruled in 2006 that the college could keep the Tribe nickname but its feathered logo was demeaning to Native Americans and had to go.</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s athletic teams will still be called the Tribe, but the college wants a mascot that may, or may not, match the nickname.</p>
<p>The asparagus stalk supporter notes that if served with cheese, the vegetable represents the school colors.</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s president will make the final decision.<br>

		<p>As a W&M; alum from the &#8220;Indian-era,&#8221; I have used the name change to turn down telephone fund-raising requests for over 20 years.  That, and removing the cross from the Wren Chapel.  Now, I&rsquo;ve got another excuse!</p>
<p>(Fun Fact: A century or so ago, the W&M; team was known as &#8220;The Loonies,&#8221; because a state insane asylum was located in Williamsburg near the university.)</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what W&M;&rsquo;s mascot looks like.  If it looks anything like Chief Wahoo, I could understand being miffed.  If it looks like a noble warrior, then what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>Next thing you know, though, PETA will get ticked at Detroit for using tigers&hellip;. </p>

<p>Well, that little cretin clearly has not one iota of sense when it comes to the issue of inclusion!</p>
<p>Clearly the new mascot must embrace all possible colors, particularly dark brown; thus, I suggest a dish of coleslaw with an abundant dollop of chocolate pudding on top of it.</p>
<p>That would be both representative and non-threatening too!</p>

		<p>Considering their name, why don&rsquo;t they call themselves the Royals?  Monarchs would be good too but the school I graduated from, Old Dominion University (which began as the Norfolk campus of William &amp; Mary), uses that name. </p>

		<p>I live in an urban area with tens of thousands of flesh-and-blood Indians.  It&rsquo;s difficult to understand why anyone would want to name his team after them!</p>
<p>After all, there were dozens, if not hundreds, of deserving tribes in Europe and the British Isles who have never been honored with a varsity mascot.  Cheruscii, anybody? Brigantes?  Ostrogoths?  Picts? <i>Vandals</i>?</p>

		<p>American: They seem to find it offensive though. But after all these years, its more of a lovable character rather than an intended jibe, from my point of view.</p>

		<p>I would just as soon we get rid of all the Indian mascots and symbols anyway. The American Indians are basically a failed people whose image is now essentially the great native &#8220;victim&#8221; blotted-out by the nasty White man. So let&rsquo;s finish the job symbolically - Indians are an anachronism and represent nothing positive in America anyway. </p>

		<p>Note to Reg @ 6:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t overlook the University of Idaho Vandals   &mdash;   a cool mascot, if ever there was&hellip;</p>
<p>And count me in the ranks of those who cannot imagine why any team, school, or organization would want to identify itself with Indians. As much as I despise the political blackballing of the NCAA, I also believe that Indian-related mascots are absurd. On the other hand, the greatest (former) collegiate mascot of all time was the Sonome (Cal.) State Cossacks, now blandly known as the &#8220;Seawolves.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I vote for calling themselves the PC&rsquo;s. Has a  nice ring to it and certainly sums up the school. the William and Mary PC&rsquo;s. Yep. Got my vote.</p>

		<p>how about fighting Aryans? Since they constantly demean whites, and having your ethnicity as a mascot is demeaning, no doubt liberals will support this.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. There are many aspects of american indian culture that are positive and that I like. However, I don&rsquo;t think the american indians care about these mascots, as someone else said, it&rsquo;s the looney whites. Actually, mascots with indians or the irish ie. the &#8220;fighting irish&#8221; are a compliment,not a put down.</p>
