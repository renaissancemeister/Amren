<h1>Austria: Police Attack on US Man Brings Up Racism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Veronika Oleksyn, AP, June 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mike Brennan was getting off a Vienna subway when two undercover police officers pounced on him, mistaking him for a drug dealer. Months later, the 35-year-old black American is still recovering from his injuries  &mdash;  and waiting for a satisfactory apology.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A recent Europe-wide study by the Vienna-based EU Fundamental Rights Agency found 55 percent of minorities and immigrants think &#8220;discrimination based on ethnic origin is widespread in their country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The survey, which questioned 23,500 people from ethnic and immigrant minorities across the 27-nation European Union, also found that Gypsies and Africans reported the most abuse and that many victims have a &#8220;lack of confidence&#8221; in government anti-racism policies. Groups surveyed included Africans, Central and East Europeans, Iraqis, Turks and Roma, or Gypsies.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a video showed police officers in the Swedish city of Malmo using racial slurs to describe youth rioting in an immigrant neighborhood. Authorities said it was an isolated incident, but critics contend it highlighted an undercurrent of xenophobia in the force.</p>
<p>In the Czech city of Brno, a policeman was charged with misuse of power and causing bodily harm resulting in death after a January incident claimed the life of a 43-year-old Vietnamese man. {snip}</p>
<p>Still, Austria&rsquo;s police have a particularly spotty record when it comes to ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>In May 1999, 25-year-old Nigerian immigrant Marcus Omofuma died while being deported after police strapped him to his airplane seat and taped his mouth and nose shut. And in 2006, police officers assaulted a Gambian man, identified only as Bakary J., at a warehouse after he refused to be deported, seriously hurting him.</p>
<p>In both cases, the officers received suspended sentences. In the Omofuma case, the three officers were found guilty of negligent homicide but acquitted of torture leading to death. In the Bakary J. case, three of the officers had been charged with physically abusing the man. A fourth was charged with neglect of his duties by doing nothing to stop his colleagues.</p>
<p>In April, Amnesty International released a report saying it was concerned skin color was too often a factor in Austrian police interventions and found shortcomings in the country&rsquo;s recording and public availability of statistics on racist crimes.</p>
<p>It said there was considerable evidence Austrian police have engaged in widespread ethnic profiling over the past decade, particularly in efforts to counter drug-related crime. It also expressed concern that disciplinary proceedings against law enforcement officials are sometimes not initiated despite &#8220;strong evidence&#8221; pointing to serious misconduct.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, Austria is a popular destination for immigrants because it is a safe and wealthy nation where job prospects are relatively good compared to other European countries. This spring, the Mercer consulting firm ranked its capital, Vienna, as the city with the world&rsquo;s overall highest quality of living. While taxes are high, Austrians enjoy universal health care, generous pensions and extended maternity leave.</p>
<p>About 545,000 of the country&rsquo;s population of 8.3 million are foreigners other than EU nationals and citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Of those, the majority  &mdash;  292,730  &mdash;  are from nations of the former Yugoslavia. Some 110,678 are from Turkey, 59,538 from Asia and 21,460 from Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, worse could be ahead with the rise of Austria&rsquo;s far-right Freedom Party, which garnered about 13 percent of the vote in recent elections after running a blatantly anti-foreigner campaign.</p>

		<p>Blacks can&rsquo;t understand that any real or imagined racism is easily avoided by not being around whites. There are plenty of non-racist black nations in the world. One wonders why they cling to us when freedom from racism is a one-way ticket to any black majority country. Yet instead of moving to Africa, this black man moved to Austria. This can only make sense in the mind of a black man because it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>

		<p>I can well understand the mistake, to Austrians they likely do all look the same. After all, how many blacks reside there? So their criminal tendencies must really stand out. Who can blame the officers for acting on sight?</p>

		<p>If Caucasians in black nations in Africa,  Jamaica, Haiti and the Virgin Islands received the same treatment, there would be no cries of &#8220;racism&#8221;, by Amnesty International. What in samhill are 21,460 blacks doing in Austria anyway, studying classical music?</p>

		<p>Men have territorial and racial instincts.I despise cruelty between humans for any reason but I think there is a real, innate desire to maintain your race(if you like it) and an environment where it can perpetuate itself into posterity. This is nothing more then the first instinct of surival extended. The current effort by political correctness to demonize this instinct, with thought and hate crimes, off course particularly at the expense of the white race is cutting on a deeply engrained psychological nerve. Competition,&hellip; beginning with vying spermazoa and continuing throughout the process of human life is elemental in this desire to maintain your genetic or national team. Of course people on a losing team often despise the karma they inherited and try to jump ship into a more succesful group&hellip;But they may be unwanted for the obvious reason!</p>

		<p><i>A recent Europe-wide study by the Vienna-based EU Fundamental Rights Agency found 55 percent of minorities and immigrants think &ldquo;discrimination based on ethnic origin is widespread in their country.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Yet - as always with these clearly &#8220;unbiased&#8221;, &#8220;neutral&#8221; journalists - we never hear the <b>natives&rsquo;</b> side of the story:<br>
And said journos are perpetually confused when the white natives of these &#8220;diverse&#8221;, &#8220;multicultural&#8221;, &#8220;minority-majority&#8221;, &#8220;immigrant-majority&#8221; neighbourhoods, suburbs, towns and cities vote in increasing numbers for &#8220;far-Right&#8221; parties.</p>
<p>Naw, I&rsquo;m just having my fellow American Renaissance readers on - all of Europe must be &#8220;racist&#8221;, &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; etc when <i>the same &#8220;immigrant groups&#8221; commit <b>the same proportion of crime</b></i>.</p>
<p><i>The survey, which questioned 23,500 people <b>from ethnic and immigrant minorities</b> across the 27-nation European Union, also found that Gypsies and Africans reported the most abuse and that many victims have a &ldquo;lack of confidence&rdquo; in government anti-racism policies. Groups surveyed included Africans, Central and East Europeans, Iraqis, Turks and Roma, or Gypsies.</i></p>
<p>Anyone want to take me up on a bet that &#8220;lack of confidence in European anti-racism policies&#8221; among an immigrant group is positively correlated with the proportion of crime said immigrant group is responsible for? </p>
<p><i>Earlier this year, a video showed police officers in the Swedish city of Malmo using racial slurs to describe youth rioting in an immigrant neighborhood. Authorities said it was an isolated incident, but critics contend it highlighted an undercurrent of xenophobia in the force.</i></p>
<p>Yes, harangue the frustrated white police officers dealing with ungrateful, destructive, rioting &#8220;immigrants&#8221; and &#8220;asylum-seekers&#8221; <b>not</b> the rioting immigrants.</p>
<p><i>In April, Amnesty International released a report saying it was concerned skin color was too often a factor in Austrian police interventions and found shortcomings in the country&rsquo;s recording and public availability of statistics on racist crimes.</i></p>
<p>My &#8220;concern&#8221; is if there are available racial statistics for crimes committed in Austria:<br>
Or maybe Amnesty wants Austria to institute Britain&rsquo;s policy of stopping whites to &#8220;balance&#8221; the racial proportions?</p>
<p><i>It said there was considerable evidence Austrian police have engaged in widespread ethnic profiling over the past decade, particularly in efforts to counter drug-related crime.</i></p>
<p>Yes, we&rsquo;ll ignore the Occam&rsquo;s Razor solution of <i>black immigrants are more likely to be involved in drug-related crime for their proportion of the population</i> for &#8220;Austria&rsquo;s police are just racist&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>Still, Austria is a popular destination for immigrants because it is a safe and wealthy nation where job prospects are relatively good compared to other European countries. This spring, the Mercer consulting firm ranked its capital, Vienna, as the city with the world&rsquo;s overall highest quality of living. While taxes are high, Austrians enjoy universal health care, generous pensions and extended maternity leave.</i></p>
<p>Which just goes to show that - for all Austria&rsquo;s supposedly &#8220;racist&#8221;, &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; police practices - the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; <b>aren&rsquo;t leaving any time soon</b>.</p>
<p><i>Still, worse could be ahead with the rise of Austria&rsquo;s far-right Freedom Party, which garnered about 13 percent of the vote in recent elections after running a blatantly anti-foreigner campaign.</i></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right there - London&rsquo;s streets are certainly safer now than 50 years ago!</p>

		<p>So they cite two or three incidents of police brutality toward Africans.  Naturally, they neglect to mention the countless white victims of African brutality.  Nor do they even bother to explain why it is that the police have such a negative opinion of Africans.  I suppose they assume it just materialized out of nowhere.</p>

		<p>Fascinating reports of violence against people of color in Europe, even deaths. I&rsquo;d be interested in what police all across Europe report too, on their (and natives) interactions with these same persons of color. Too difficult? How about for just one city, say, Vienna? Aren&rsquo;t police even required to have cameras now?</p>

<p>Do all primarily/traditionally White nations have a &#8220;Statue of Liberty&#8221; that somehow promises the hope of a better future for non-whites coming from chaotic and oppressive non-white nations? These non-white immigrants assume that their &#8220;rioting&#8221; not only must be tolerated, but must be free of criticism. If only the Irish, Germans, Italians and so many others had had it so good in the US when they emigrated from their native lands. Can&rsquo;t these immigrants rise to the challenge to earn the respect of the nations that took them in?   </p>

		<p>In then Central Europe, blacks, especially Nigerians, often &#8220;work&#8221; as drug dealers, so no wonder police gets interested in them. <br>
Just go for an evening stroll in the very center of Prague (Czech Rep., St. Wenceslas Square. You will get an impression of being mystically transferred to Lagos&hellip;<br>
An concerning the case with the dead Vietnamese in Brno - he was a heroin dealer and police was called by his landlady because he started to be aggressive. Methadon has been found in his blood.</p>

		<p>Viennese police are known for their tough, no-nonsense attitude, and have been criticized for being too heavy-handed many times - not just when it comes to dealing with minority groups. Of course, when it comes to the groups who commit the serious crimes where a heavy hand is justified, that&rsquo;s the time they&rsquo;re supposed to ease up. Vienna has had a spate of murders over the past year and home invasions have sky-rocketed. Many people are glad the cops don&rsquo;t take any nonsense.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 545,000 of the country&rsquo;s population of 8.3 million are foreigners other than EU nationals and citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Of those, the majority &mdash; 292,730 &mdash; are from nations of the former Yugoslavia. Some 110,678 are from Turkey, 59,538 from Asia and 21,460 from Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>These foreigner-population statistics are always so dodgy. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a big stretch of the imagination in thinking there are several times those numbers.</p>

		<p>Comment #7 reveals the chink in the argument of socialism.  As long as everyone pays into the system, it will work&hellip;maybe not well, but it will creak along.  Throw in a substantial number of persons who do not pull their own weight and the system will collapse.  We are witnessing this phenomenon in Europe right now. It&rsquo;s why the left did so poorly in the last European elections.  Change is definitely coming, but not the kind the left wants.  I was recently in a hospital and saw about half blacks.  My guess is that most of the money paying for these services, even for whites, is coming from tax dollars.  This can&rsquo;t keep on like this.  The violence and incompetency of minorities is wrecking the system, just as it is doing in Austria now.  </p>

		<p>So, a couple of Swedish Cops in Malmo, Sweden were heard using Racial slurs toward rioting youths? Well, they better be releived of duty right away.</p>
<p>How could they think of hurting the feelings of those poor Rioters. Malmo, for those who don&rsquo;t know, is a Swedish City which has been overrun by Muslims from Pakistan, and where Ambulances cannot respond without a Police escort. </p>
<p>I can assure you, as a Cop, that if I was in a Riot situation, the last thing any Minority should worry about, is what name I called him. </p>
<p>At least the Austrian Cops are handling things the way the Irish Cops used to, in New York City. Take that, Al Sharpton.</p>

		<p>From this documentary it does appear that Vienna Police did act properly in arresting Mr. Brennan:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTNDJthfA_4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTNDJthfA_4</a></p>
<p>The officiers in question clearly identified themselves as law enforcement shouting &#8220;Polizei&#8221;.  Unfortunately Brennan didn&rsquo;t surrender and they probably acted at what they perceived to be a neccesary level of force to subdue hin.  </p>
<p>Granted I don&rsquo;t think they needed to beat up Mr. Brennan but if the officiers felt they dealing with a potentially dangerous and armed suspect and he was perceived to be resisting then they probably acted within their training.  Although I feel the situation could have been handled with far less force I don&rsquo;t think the officiers were being unreasonable given their perception of the situation (taking down an armed drug dealer) and the suspect not surrender.  </p>
<p>Fortunately this didn&rsquo;t happen the US, where officiers have grounds for using deadly force under similar circumstances.  </p>
<p>This is going sound crazy but I really do believe this situation was a true misunderstanding.</p>

		<p>The fact is that in Vienna practically every black male is a pimp and/or drug pusher. In private conversation, police make no bones about that (a few years ago they roughed up a UN diplomat, which caused some stir :).<br>
They are barred from working legally until their &#8220;asylum&#8221; requests are processed, which can take years; though the state provides rather generously for them. Welfare and young blondes is what draws them. (I remember a friend in the army, &#8220;assistance&#8221; on the eastern border, bitterly complaining that the illegals they caught were quartered, at taxpayer´s expense, in two-bed rooms, ate à la carte and got pocket money while their platoon slept in a wet cellar and ate overripe army rats)<br>
-As for Omofuma, he violently resisted deportation (and getting a deportation order at all is quite a feat in Austria). Still, he got the royal treatment - business class and two policemen to look after his needs (a waste of money, if you ask me). If you are doped up AND have a heart condition, it is usually not a very good idea to try to bite your minders (duct tape has since been replaced by a motorcycle helmet for the wacko cases).<br>
Bakary J. - it was a nighttime festivity in the park of city hall. He was heavily drugged up and aggressive, and it took four officers to get him down. Again, drugs and heart condition are a counterindication to messing with the Austrian police. They hardly ever shoot, and I have only seen them using sticks before and after soccer games.<br>
Still &hellip; (g)</p>

u.s.a. the german police at one time would really shoot first and ask questions much later.  if you are in europe and get into <br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so much the consequence or even the outcome of the event that&rsquo;s so important but how the officiers reacted and whether or not they followed procedure, clearly not.  There is alot of &#8220;grey&#8221; in law enforcement, you have no idea who you&rsquo;re dealing what&rsquo;s the situation and sometimes you have to make a critical life or death decision very quickly.  There are alot of situations where cops do make bad calls(i.e. someone winds up dead) but should be let off because they did things &#8220;by the book&#8221;.  </p>
<p>As a manager I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect your people to always do the right thing all the time,even if they do man well, because all human beings are confronted with situations where they must make decisions with inadequate information.  </p>
<p>However one thing that you can insure is that your people follow the rules.  Clearly officiers who use racial epithets are not following the rules, even if they are operating under extraordinary circumstances.  </p>
<p>I do agree that officiers must make critical decisions under very high amounts of durress but their job is such that they need to sometimes put away their human emotions and operate according to the rules of their agency.  As Chief Parker himself once said  :</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ll always have cases like this because we have one big problem in selecting police officers &hellip; we have to recruit from the human race.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I watched 8:00 minutes of the almost 10:00 minutes of the You Tube video, through the link that &#8220;Yellow Man&#8221; Poster #19, had included on his comment. I had past my tolerance threshhold.</p>
<p>I see that this case, where a Black Suspect resisted the Austrian Police, when they called out to him and identified themselves, and he continued to do whatever he was doing. </p>
<p>It is hard to believe that someone attending College in a foreign Country does not speak, or even understand the language, of the Country that they are studying in. How is it that Mike Brennan doesn&rsquo;t speak German? </p>
<p>Maybe he is pulling what the Hispanics do with the &#8220;No Speak English&#8221; routine, here. </p>
<p>Anyway, his failure to comply with a Police Officer&rsquo;s lawful order brought him a higher degree of compliance. </p>
<p>I see that even Amnesty International jumped in on this. I also see how all the Doctors and Nurses are fawning over this guy.</p>
<p>While on You Tube, I was looking for the videos of Amnesty International doing an investigation regarding Ben Kensella&rsquo;s murder, in England, Christopher Jones, in Maryland, and Channon Christian, and Christopher Newsome, in Tennessee. </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, there wasn&rsquo;t any for all of these White Murder Victims of Black Gang Crime. </p>

		<p>Comment #7 reveals the chink in the argument of socialism. As long as everyone pays into the system, it will work&hellip;maybe not well, but it will creak along. Throw in a substantial number of persons who do not pull their own weight and the system will collapse</p>
<p>Right, a lifeboat for 30 people in it and which has 30 people in it ROWING will get where it wants to go, throw another 60 people hanging on and we know the results.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s so funny. As a former telemarketer, those are the first words out of their mouths. Telemarketers often read from a script that&rsquo;s designed to disguise the fact they are telemaketers for as long as possible. I know folks aren&rsquo;t fooled That easy, but it&rsquo;s pretty apparent immigrants really don&rsquo;t want to talk to any &#8216;gringo&rsquo;, or whatever it is Asians call us, at all, and &#8216;no English&rsquo; is a fast, easy excuse for them. </p>

		<p>So if Black are singled out for claimed police brutality&hellip; the logical answer is they should stay out of white European countries.   I&rsquo;m sure our White European friends are very much aware of the high incidence of crime among non-White immigrants in Europe. So why should it be unusual for Blacks to be assumed to be criminals by White police officers?</p>
<p>Even in America, criminal Blacks outnumber criminal Whites by more than a hefty margin. As any perusal of crime statistics would serve to point out. It might not be politically correct to state this, but it sure happens to be true.</p>

		<p>21 AnonymousChicago: The German cops killed more American soldiers than the Baader-Meinhof Gang.  In the 70s, a car full of GIs didn&rsquo;t stop for an anti-B-M Gang  roadblock and got slaughtered.  NEVER argue with a German cop.  Mike Brennan is a fool, nothing more.</p>
