<h1>Lawyer: Arkansas Shooting Suspect &#8216;Brainwashed&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, June 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Tennessee man suspected in Monday&rsquo;s attack on a recruitment center in Little Rock, Arkansas, was brainwashed and tortured while imprisoned in Yemen, his lawyer said Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;My client is a young man, I think, brainwashed,&#8221; attorney Jim Hensley told CNN. &#8220;What else could be explained for a young man who&rsquo;s a true American, plays football, helps his grandmother and mows the lawns of his neighbors? Comes back and then finds himself in this situation? That is not a normal situation in my book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abdulhakim Muhammad, formerly known as Carlos Bledsoe, is charged with killing Pvt. William Long, 23, of Conway, Arkansas, and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula, 18, of Jacksonville, Arkansas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In September 2007, Muhammad left Tennessee State University in Nashville, where he was studying business, and traveled to Yemen to teach English to children and to learn Arabic.</p>
<p>There, &#8220;he felt at peace with these people,&#8221; even marrying a Yemeni, Hensley said.</p>
<p>But things began to change when his client was detained for a minor visa violation in Yemen and sent to prison, where he was housed with radical Islamic fundamentalists, Hensley said.</p>
<p>In November 2008, Muhammad was arrested in the port city of Aden for overstaying his visa and deported two months later in cooperation with the U.S. Embassy, a Yemeni official said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hensley said Muhammad told him that, during the last two weeks he was held, he was deprived of sleep and food and &#8220;was slapped around a little bit,&#8221; enduring beatings on the backs of his legs.</p>
<p>During Muhammad&rsquo;s time in the prison, an FBI agent visited him not as an ally but as an interrogator, Hensley said.</p>
<p>However, Mohammed AlBasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy, rejected Hensley&rsquo;s assertion. &#8220;It is understood that the process of radicalization can take a number of years, not a couple of weeks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So, the statement that his lawyer made, that he was brainwashed and tortured for weeks in Yemen, are baseless.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hensley said he was speaking to the news media because Muhammad had asked him to. &#8220;His agenda is different from mine; he wants to be a martyr,&#8221; the lawyer said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Are we supposed to believe that some Yemeni jihadist kidnapped him here, forced him to get on a place to Yemen, took him to a jail and he caught the Stockholm Syndrome?  He willingly went to Yemen because he was already radicalized here.</p>
<p>I have not yet had a confirmation on whether his conversion to Islam came as a result of a stint in prison.  Almost all black men that convert do so because of prison, but most drop it once they get out.  The few that keep their Arabic names do so because they want to conceal their rap sheet drawn with their birth name.</p>

		<p>Gotta give this lawyer credit for imagination, but his theory isn&rsquo;t nearly as loopy as &#8220;the TV made him do it&#8221; (violent TV shows caused kid to murder) or &#8220;urban survival syndrome&#8221; (endemic violence forces inner-city black thug to kill on impulse) that have already been used.</p>

		<p>Most &#8216;true Americans&rsquo; don&rsquo;t change their names to Abdulhakim Muhammad, get arrested in Yemen, and open fire on U.S. soldiers. His lawyer is the one who&rsquo;s brainwashed; or maybe brain dead.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m actually from Little Rock and you wouldn&rsquo;t believe the non-sense this guys lawyer is saying.  He also claims that Abdulhakim Muhammad converted to Islam because of its tradition of improving people&rsquo;s lives and that he was forced into terrorism by our government because FBI agents were mean to him.  </p>

		<p>He &#8220;comes back and finds himself in this situation&#8221;?  No personal responsibility or human agency need apply here, no sir.  He was just sitting on the porch, mindin&rsquo; his bidness, and suddenly &#8220;found himself&#8221; getting an SKS, loading it, getting into a car, seeking out a military recruiting station, and opening fire on two soldiers.</p>
<p>Gee whilikers, I sure hope I never find myself in a situation like that.</p>
<p>If he has no human agency, he&rsquo;s not human.  Is that what the lawyer is saying?</p>

		<p>Most likely, this American black initially used Islam as a tool to get at the women of the finer races - in this case, Yemeni women.  So he got himself such a woman.  But then he actually started to BELIEVE in Islam and he went berserk.  Black men must think very poorly of black women, since they&rsquo;ll do anything to hook up with women of other races.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Comes back and then finds himself in this situation&#8221;?</p>
<p>Just what &#8220;situation&#8221; did this guy find himself in, exactly?  It seems to me he found himself back with his family, footloose and free in the most prosperous country in the world, rather than jailed in a flyblown fourth-world desert.</p>
<p>When I got out of prison and came back home, I was delighted to be sleeping in my own bed and eating my own choice of meals, rather than so angry I wanted to shoot some complete strangers.</p>
<p>Moreover, what was this perp doing with a loaded SKS rifle in his car?  That sounds like premeditiation to me.  Muhammad almost certainly was encouraged along these lines by radicals in Yemen, but that does not absolve him of responsibility for his actions.  If they had told him to jump off a high-rise building, would he have done that?</p>

		<p>I think attorney Jim Hensley has a valid point.  All you have to do is look at the &#8220;brainwashing&#8221; that the liberal biased media has done to the American people which has caused them to do insane and outrageous things.  One good example of this is the election of Obama.  However I must also say this took years and years of constant propaganda which led up to this atrocity as opposed to a short stay in Yemen which gives the prosecution a valid point.  </p>

		<p>Just another pathetic attempt at an insanity defense. Plus, he&rsquo;s got back to back bigotry hits: black plus Muslim. Rule against him Mr. and Mrs Jury, and you&rsquo;re &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>(sarcasm = &#8220;on&#8221;)Maybe his lawyer should announce that his client is gay. Then they could call the whole thing off. (sarcasm = &#8220;off&#8221;)</p>

		<p>gemalo, be fair, that&rsquo;s what lawyers do, like it or not, is advocate for their clients; you note that the lawyer says &#8220;&ldquo;His agenda is different from mine; he wants to be a martyr,&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That said, compare this to the leftist outrage over the murder of one abortionist.  Does anyone think if this poor lost soul had actually killed a soldier, the leftist agitprop machine would have been spilling the same virulent venom against him and Islamism as they have against Bill O&rsquo;Reilly the last few days? </p>
