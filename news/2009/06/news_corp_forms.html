<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D98NTN484&amp;show_article=1">News Corp. Forms Diversity Council</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, AP, June 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>News Corp. is forming an external diversity council in response to pressure over a New York Post cartoon that critics said compared President Barack Obama to a dead chimpanzee.</p>
<p>The cartoon appeared in February. News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch published an apology in the Post, but civil rights and community organizations demanded further action.</p>
<p>NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous said Wednesday that News Corp. had agreed to form a &#8220;diversity community council&#8221; that will meet semiannually with company executives.</p>
<p>The council will include members of the NAACP, 100 Black Men of America, the National Action Network and the National Urban League.</p>
<p>The letter also said that the company will include a &#8220;diversity statement of commitment&#8221; in its annual report.<br>

		<p>The odd part about Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s media ventures is that while they are slightly conservative in the U.S., everywhere else they&rsquo;re very liberal.  So if his U.S. outlets will effectively be run and monitored by the NAACP, then Fox and the NYP will be nothing more than carbon copies of the rest of the media.</p>

<p>The only way blacks can get positions they&rsquo;re not qualified for is through extortion, via AA, and they have no shame whatsoever in doing so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many black news writers I&rsquo;ve read that are just plain incompetent.  And others who are in positions they&rsquo;re not qualified for is in the millions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s those whites like Murdoch who encourage them, because they&rsquo;re too spineless to ignore what they want or just plain tell them like it is.</p>
<p>How disgusting.  </p>
<p>But I do what I can to silently protest:  I don&rsquo;t watch movies with a black in a leading or strong supporting role; I won&rsquo;t buy a high dollar item from a black, like a truck, furniture, etc.: I don&rsquo;t watch news casts with black reporters or anchors; and I avoid everyplace and anything I can where blacks are present.</p>
<p>Not much just by myself, but it would be devestating for blacks if just 1/3 of all whites did the same thing.<br>

		<p>In 2008 Rupert Murdoch gave a talk in which he said the following: &#8220;Finally, Australia will be strong only if it is open to immigration. Thank goodness we are beyond where we were a few decades ago. After World War Two, we opened our doors to Southern Europe and other non-Anglo populations. And after the Vietnam war we began welcoming our neighbours in the region. In a relatively short period of time, we have buried &#8216;White Australia&rsquo;, and in its place have raised a modern, diverse society.&#8221; </p>
<p>Does that sound like a man would be against forming a &#8220;diversity council&#8221;? </p>

		<p>I object to the phrasing of this post.  Amren is trying to make it sound like Murdoch is opposed to things like diversity councils.  We need to get over this idea that the rich and big business are secretly on our side and are only promoting &#8220;diversity&#8221; because they are &#8220;forced&#8221; to.</p>

		<p>Old Rupert has to operate not just in Australia but in China, among other places. He won&rsquo;t willingly make changes that will make his holdings unprofitable, but he will get in line if there is no choice. This is how the extortionists can succeed.</p>

		<p>Joe is right.  Murdoch is married to an Asian.  He supports diversity because he&rsquo;s made a personal commitment to it.  None of his outlets is conservative in any traditional way.  The man is moderately liberal and he is opportunistic.  Mainly the latter.</p>

<p>They have buried White Australia!    What a proud accomplishment for him to brag about!  He is no friend of whites.</p>
<p>Considering that he is an inter-racial marriage, with inter-racial children, the above statement is not surprising at all. Rupert Murdock is not only a supporter of multi-racialism, he is a practitioner of it. He is in no way any supporter of whites, and is plainly not concerned with survival of the white race.</p>

		<p>The main objective of &#8220;diversity&#8221; is injection minority spies into every corner of life in America so nobody under no circumstances will feel comfortable expressing his opinion about white disposession of America.<br>

		<p>The following is quoted from  The Chinese Secret Service  by Richard Deacon, copyright 1974, ISBN 0-345-24901-1-225, Ballantine Books, New York,  from pages 467, 468 and 469, Chapter 37, styled  New Faces in the Secret Service 1960-1974:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese technique in recruiting such people is largely one of letting the fly come to the spider.  Once they are assured that his interest is genuine, or that he has been disenchanted by Soviet communism, or some other form of communism, then he becomes a primary target for the Secret Service.  In this connection the Chinese Secret Service&rsquo;s primary interest has been in Australian journalists.  This in itself is an interesting rebuttal of the idea held in some Western circles that the Chinese have yet to learn to discriminate.  The fact is that for more than a quarter of a century Australian journalists have made an enormous impression by their diligence in research, their crusading patience and overall ability all over the world.  It is no exaggeration to say that they command some of the key reporting posts in British journalism, that they are well-regarded in the U.S.A. and that, despite this, they remain dedicated left-wingers, some of them openly pro-Communist, others bending over backwards to explain that they are against the Russians in Czechoslovakia and not critical of Communist Parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese have used their own people for espionage rather less in Australia and New Zealand than in any other countries of the world.  Gough Whitlam ought to know that back in the early &#8216;fifties a Chinese network which covered Australia was directed from London and that the Chinese Secret Service has always had something like half a dozen Australian extreme left-wing operators working for it not only inside Australia, but also in London, Paris and other centers where they have managed to mute their political beliefs.&#8221;   </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal had a front page article on Mr. Murdoch and his (then) new third wife, Wendy Deng (or Ding) from Communist Hong Kong.  It mentioned that her uncle was General in the Red Chinese Peoples Army.</p>
<p>That said, China is Australia&rsquo;s major trading partner, and Mr. Murdoch has tried for some time to enter the Chinese newspaper market.  So far he has been shut out by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>He started out with Australian citizenship and now has U.S. citizenship.  Murdoch is an interesting guy.  I never understood how he made all his money in Australia and its newspaper business, enough to spring board his way into the London and US markets.  I imagine someone one day will write the definitive account of his raise to greatness in the business world.  I think he took over the Wall Street Journal and has trashed that.  I no longer subscribe.  Is Rupert hooked up with China?  I have no idea.  But with some of his views, one wonders.</p>

		<p>The duties, requirements, and expected results from this Diversity Council sound so vague and weak that it only leads me to conclude that this is only a minor bump in the road for Murdoch in the form of a shakedown that will involve some chump change extortion money being paid to one or two HNICs of each of the respective organizations represented on the Council. (NAACP, 100 Black Men of America, the National Action Network and the National Urban League)  A forensic audit of the personal wealth of the above referenced individuals in a year would in all liklihood bear out my assessment.  </p>

The entire business elite in the USA is hooked up with China. China has provided them with enormous profits (at the expense of American workers) and Rupert and his media buddies are all cheerleaders for &#8220;free trade.&#8221; </p>

		<p>This is the way the game is played folks.</p>
<p>When any public figure, institution or business does anything, however innocently, that can conceivably be argued to be &#8220;racist&#8221; the NAACP &amp; such are not upset, hurt, outraged, etc.. they are delighted! This way they get to play the hurt victim (a well practiced role) and demand as much in the way of compensations, concessions and shakedowns as the suckers will give into.<br>
   When will white people stop being such chumps for blacks who need to recognized as their adversaries? - and they take no prisoners.</p>
