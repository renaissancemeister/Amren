<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/nyregion/11racial.html?_r=1">Latino-Black Rivalry Helped Fuel G.O.P.&rsquo;s Takeover of State Senate</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Confessore and Danny Hakim, New York Times, June 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} two Democratic state senators, Pedro Espada Jr. and Hiram Monserrate, joined Republicans on the Senate floor Monday to kick off their surprise takeover of the chamber {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latino lawmakers, meanwhile, have long complained of being shut out of top positions. They were angry that no Hispanic candidate was put forward when a vacancy opened up on the State Court of Appeals earlier this year, and even angrier when Gov. David A. Paterson did not appoint a Hispanic to the United States Senate seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a black and Latino alliance that at times has been tenuous and at times has been robust,&#8221; said Hakeem Jeffries, a black assemblyman from Brooklyn. &#8220;This could make it more tenuous.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m too happy about this.  First off, the New York Senate was run by Republicans for years.  In 1994, one of its members, George Pataki, won Governor and had three terms.  This didn&rsquo;t preclude New York from being one of the most liberal in the country.</p>
<p>If you thought the Repugnican Hispandering Machine was loud before now, its sounds are about to get deafening.  Now they will have the notion that we&rsquo;re on our way to the Great Hispanic Vote Pumpkin rising out of the patch.</p>

		<p>More proof that multicultural societies are dysfunctional and doomed to failure every time they&rsquo;re attempted.</p>
<p>History is littered with the rotting corpses of diverse societies, yet there&rsquo;s always a faction popping up that thinks &#8220;this time it will be different.  We will do a better job.&#8221;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t possible to teach someone to be intelligent, so stupidity will continue to rear its ugly head until it is cut off for good.</p>

		<p>Hiram Monserrate is an ex-cop turned politician who was recently arrested for smashing a glass over his girlfriend&rsquo;s head. He now absurdly claims the arrest was a frame-up by the NYPD.</p>

		<p>Ice and others may see this as &#8220;proof&#8221; that multicultural societies are dysfunctional, but the plain fact is that a scrambled egg cannot be unscrambled.</p>

		<p>Blacks and brows will not have a true alliance.  They will always fight with eachother about something.  Furthermore, the only reason blacks want an alliance with hispanics is to make another victim group to go after whites.  That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s really about.  What is it with most blacks?  As a group (yes, exceptions to the rule), they are always trying to have other minorities and other blacks who are successful on their own to be victims like themselves.</p>

		<p>A Samurai, when faced with 2 opponents, made an alliance with the weaker to defeat the stronger.  That way, the Samurai was left with the weaker to deal with by himself.</p>
<p>In other words, using hispanics to defeat blacks (or vice versa) can be a wise strategy, as long as whites don&rsquo;t forget that the alliance is only temporary&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is good to strike the serpents head with your enemies hand&#8221; Chinese proverb<br>
Maybe we&rsquo;re giving the Hispanics too much credit for using divisive strategy but its just as likely that we&rsquo;re underestimating them. They are clearly more intelligent than Blacks and outnumber them in this hemisphere (and within the USA).<br>
But no matter what happens, I don&rsquo;t think I will ever feel sorry for the Blacks; they deserve to be on the receiving end of what they&rsquo;ve dished out against whites for so long. <br>
Of course Hispanics will end up being a much, much greater threat to white unity than blacks ever were. </p>
