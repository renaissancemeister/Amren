			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandy Cohen, AP, June 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Harmless comic characters or racist robots? The buzz over the summer blockbuster &#8220;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&#8221; only grew Wednesday as some said two jive-talking Chevy characters were racial caricatures. Skids and Mudflap, twin robots disguised as compact hatchbacks, constantly brawl and bicker in rap-inspired street slang. They&rsquo;re forced to acknowledge that they can&rsquo;t read. One has a gold tooth.</p>
<p>As good guys, they fight alongside the Autobots and are intended to provide comic relief. But their traits raise the specter of stereotypes most notably seen when Jar Jar Binks, the clumsy, broken-English speaking alien from &#8220;Star Wars: Episode I  &mdash;  The Phantom Menace,&#8221; was criticized as a caricature.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Todd Herrold, who watched the movie in New York City, called the characters &#8220;outrageous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s one thing when robot cars are racial stereotypes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the movie also had a bucktoothed black guy who is briefly in one scene who&rsquo;s also a stereotype.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s done in fun,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s stereotypes  &mdash;  they are robots, by the way. These are the voice actors. This is kind of the direction they were taking the characters and we went with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bay said the twins&rsquo; parts &#8220;were kind of written but not really written, so the voice actors is when we started to really kind of come up with their characters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actor Reno Wilson, who is black, voices Mudflap. Tom Kenny, the white actor behind SpongeBob SquarePants, voices Skids.</p>
<p>Wilson said Wednesday that he never imagined viewers might consider the twins to be racial caricatures. When he took the role, he was told that the alien robots learned about human culture through the Web and that the twins were &#8220;wannabe gangster types.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I purely did it for kids,&#8221; the director said. &#8220;Young kids love these robots, because it makes it more accessible to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman said they followed Bay&rsquo;s lead in creating the twins. Still, the characters aren&rsquo;t integral to the story, and when the action gets serious, they disappear entirely, notes Tasha Robinson, associate entertainment editor at The Onion.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t really have any positive effect on the film,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They only exist to talk in bad ebonics, beat each other up and talk about how stupid each other is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hollywood has a track record of using negative stereotypes of black characters for comic relief, said Todd Boyd, a professor of popular culture at the University of Southern California&rsquo;s School of Cinematic Arts, who has not seen the &#8220;Transformers&#8221; sequel.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a history of people getting laughs at the expense of African-Americans and African-American culture,&#8221; Boyd said. &#8220;These images are not completely divorced from history even though it&rsquo;s a new movie and even though they&rsquo;re robots and not humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>American cinema also has a tendency to deal with race indirectly, said Allyson Nadia Field, an assistant professor of cinema and media studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a persistent dehumanization of African-Americans throughout Hollywood that displaces issues of race onto non-human entities,&#8221; said Field, who also hasn&rsquo;t seen the film. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not about skin color or robot color. It&rsquo;s about how their actions and language are coded racially.&#8221;</p>
<p>If these characters weren&rsquo;t animated and instead played by real black actors, &#8220;then you might have to admit that it&rsquo;s racist,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;But stick it into a robot&rsquo;s mouth, and it&rsquo;s just a robot, it&rsquo;s OK.&#8221;</p>

Blacks demand representation in movies. They insist on black characters so Hollywood obliges.</p>
<p>BUT, showing blacks AS THEY ARE, ALWAYS results in charges of stereotyping.</p>
<p>This is a classic black no win.</p>
<p>If they presented blacks not as stereotypes, blacks would complain blacks weren&rsquo;t &#8216;authentic&rsquo; or recognizable as black. If you make them recognizable as black, they&rsquo;re seen as what they are; stereotypes.</p>
<p>Damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>On a sidebar note, Michael Jackson is dead. It won&rsquo;t be long before the Bantus foam at the mouth about his being murdered by whitey because of him getting off of the child molestation charges.</p>
<p>Think it won&rsquo;t happen? I&rsquo;d make book on it. </p>
<p>The amazing thing is, no Bantu detectives are on this case. If it was up to me, ONLY BANTU detectives would handle this. Didn&rsquo;t Los Angeles learn anything from the Simpson case?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re on to it, ma&rsquo;am, but you didn&rsquo;t go far enough. Why are stereotypes so stubbornly persistent, as Establishment commentators and do-gooders are so fond of saying? The answer is so simple, and ultimately so liberating:</p>
<p>All stereotypes are <i>true</i>  &mdash;  in a larger statistical sense. And that&rsquo;s not just an abstraction  &mdash;  it means  that average people in daily life  &mdash;  as in year after year after year of daily life  &mdash;  directly experience a whole bunch of statistical data, as they encounter &#8220;diversity&#8221;. If they&rsquo;re reasonably intelligent (as in being &#8220;normal&#8221; white people), they pretty much can&rsquo;t help noticing reality, and internalizing it.</p>
<p><i>All stereotypes are true!</i> And this truth is common knowledge, regardless of whether  we are allowed to notice and comment by our &#8220;betters&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I find it funny that the headline of the article uses the phrase, &#8220;jive-talking&#8221;. Who uses this phrase still? It&rsquo;s from the 1970&rsquo;s and not since the early eighties have I heard a Black person use that phrase. In fact the AP is guilty of stereotyping because they automatically refer to Black speech as &#8220;jive-talking&#8221;. It&rsquo;s ironic, I know.</p>

<p>When your &#8220;culture&#8221; consists of baggy pants, ebonics, gold teeth and gangsta rap most people WILL laugh at you just as they would chuckle at a circus clown.</p>
<p>&#8220;These images are not completely divorced from history&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: the stereotypes are accurate since most blacks speak ebonics.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that Transformers would be pegged for anti-black racism considered what one of the main actors in this movie recently said. When asked what tactics she would use to negotiate with Megatron to prevent his demolition of the world, Meghan Fox responded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d barter with him,&rdquo; she muses to the July, issue Total Film UK, &ldquo;and say instead of the entire planet, can you just take out all of the white trash, hillbilly, anti-gay, super bible-beating people in Middle America?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>According to her bio on Wikipedia, Megan Fox is a bisexual from a broken home in Tennessee. She has 8 tattoos, admits to using illegal drugs and once sought to establish a relationship with a female stripper.</p>

		<p>Many of the people who are offended by these robots have no problem with the practice of almost always having white males play the stooge in commercials when a commercial has such a role.<br>
 <br>
Also, take note of any commercials for home security systems. See who the criminal is 100% of the time.</p>

		<p>Anybody seen that black comedian, Kat Williams? If not, you&rsquo;re not missing anything. But regardless, his performance is nothing more than the personification of the modern black male mentality -  a shallow, insecure, vulgar ne&rsquo;er-do-well who strives to live up to the grand title of &#8220;pimp.&#8221; The mostly black crowds go wild at this act, and I can&rsquo;t recall any NAACP or other race hustler groups protesting his acts.</p>
<p>Oh yeah&hellip;it&rsquo;s OK when they do it.</p>

		<p>Instead of Skids and Mudflap, why didn&rsquo;t they just call them Heckle and Jeckle?  <br>
I don&rsquo;t believe that they liberals didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing, or that Jar Jar Binks was not a caricature of a Black.  Adult liberals don&rsquo;t really like Blacks any more than anyone else.</p>

		<p>I could never figure out why the Shrek series felt pressed to have a &#8216;black acting&rsquo; donkey.  Hollywood puts blacks into parts where they clearly don&rsquo;t belong in order to be PC.  Meanwhile, we never see blacks as evil, criminals or welfare bums.</p>

		<p>They should have made them bucktoothed, southern-accent-talking, white-trash wannabe robots. Sure, there is a history of people getting laughs at the expense at the expense of hillbilly-americans, and Hollywood is persistantly dehumanizing southerners as white trash, hillbilly, anti-gay, super bible-beating people, but they are white, so its funny!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t recall any stink over Tow-mater, the moronic redneck tow truck recently portrayed in a computerized cartoon made by Disney, (a hellish diversity hellhole disguised as a family fun park).  Why?  Because white people can take a JOKE.  Humor is one of the cornerstones of civilized people, so it is absolutely NO wonder to me that primitives use their limited brain power to whine over issues where humor evades them.</p>

		<p>My son showed me an animated rap video he downloaded off the internet with a black singer saying all sorts of stereotypes on it.  The lyrics go something like this:</p>
<p>Read a book N****r<br>
Read a book<br>
Brush your teeth N****r<br>
Brush your teeth<br>
and so forth.</p>
<p>This Transformer issue pales in comparison to what their own people say about each other.<br>

<p>It does contain a lot of pejoratives, so be warned.  I&rsquo;m just amazed that no blacks or civil rights groups picked up on the fact that they seem, for some reason, to be preaching to grown men things that children should learn by the age of 10, save the part about taking care of your own children.</p>

<p>It would be ironic if his (its?) response was to incinerate her immediately following her little anti-white diatribe, and then comment that he doesn&rsquo;t deal with little narcissistic Hollywood whores. He could then obliterate the rest of that town on similar grounds; or at least: Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, and Kate Hudson</p>

		<p>Eh? Having a larf here aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t every kids&rsquo; movie in recent times with that awful &#8216;half-animation&rsquo; have some sassy &#8216;jive-talking&rsquo; (sorry) little character that sounds like Eddie Murphy or Richard &#8220;Ohhh-SHeee  &mdash;  -it&#8221; Pryor?</p>
<p>&#8220;I find it funny that the headline of the article uses the phrase, &ldquo;jive-talking&rdquo;. Who uses this phrase still?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, first time I heard that term was from that horrible (70s) BeeGee&rsquo;s song and they weren&rsquo;t even black (God how they tried&hellip;)! That would be about as obsolete as referring to someone as &#8216;old bean&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing when robot cars are racial stereotypes,&rdquo; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say mate! Every time I turn on the god  &mdash;  -m television I see a robot car used as a racial stereotype and I&rsquo;m darn tired of it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;but the movie also had a bucktoothed black guy who is briefly in one scene who&rsquo;s also a stereotype.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really? OK people, how many people from the Southern ares of The USA do you see portrayed on the holy TV with bad teeth? A grass-chewin&rsquo; bloke with a straw hat and a dodgey old pick-up, a backward-looking  pregnant wife with worse teeth with a hoard of children with no shoes on. Not to mention the incest references that are meant to be funny etc, etc, etc. And I live in Australia! I wouldn&rsquo;t see one quarter of it here, yet it&rsquo;s universal humour! What was that about robot cars again?<br>

		<p>At a local high school the blacks typically wear such bizarre clothing a parody is impossible. This idiocy has been going on for generations. You have to ask what could prompt a young man to talk exclusively in eff-talk,never be seen with a book, wear pants at his knees ( they have to hold on to their beltlines when they run) and always wear baseball caps askew, but then, when asked about his post graduate plans, say &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to law school&#8221;.<br>
