			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sorious Samura, Independent (London), June 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In 1999 I witnessed a gang rape in Sierra Leone. I was forced to watch a group of rebel soldiers taking it in turns to rape a young girl in front of an audience of jeering men. It was the height of the civil conflict and rape had become a devastating weapon of war. When I moved to Britain I believed I had escaped such horrific sexual violence. As my Dispatches investigation tomorrow night shows, I was mistaken. Gang rape is happening here  &mdash;  and what I have found most disturbing as an African is that a disproportionate number of these attacks are being carried out by black or mixed-race young men.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, police and child welfare experts working on Channel 4&rsquo;s Street Weapons Commission told us of their concerns about gang rape. Then two big cases hit the headlines.</p>
<p>In December, nine schoolboys, some as young as 13 at the time of the attack, were convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl. She was dragged between tower blocks in Hackney where she was threatened with a knife, hit and raped during an ordeal that lasted an hour and a half  &mdash;  some of which was filmed on mobile phones. In January, three men were convicted of gang raping a 16-year-old with learning disabilities for two hours before dousing her with caustic soda in an effort to get rid of the evidence.</p>
<p>How prevalent is this crime and why it is happening in Britain? Despite the seriousness of the crime, I was amazed to discover that no national statistics exist: gang rape is simply not recorded as a separate crime category. So over a period of several months we set about collating our own.</p>
<p>We approached the Crown Prosecution Service, the Association of Chief Police Officers, all 50 police forces, crown courts, barristers and rape referral centres to try to establish the numbers.</p>
<p>One of the few police forces to have begun recording the figures of reported gang rape is the Metropolitan Police. In 2008 alone, they received reports of 85 gang rapes. Using the Met&rsquo;s definition of gang rape  &mdash;  those involving three or more perpetrators  &mdash;  we began to look at the number of convictions. We tracked down 29 cases, from January 2006 to March 2009, in which a total of 92 young people were convicted of involvement in gang rape.</p>
<p>One fact stood out. Of those convicted, 66 were black or mixed race, 13 were white and the remainder were from other countries including Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.</p>
<p>Clearly this is not a crime exclusive to black communities, but I found it impossible to ignore the fact that such a high proportion were committed by black and mixed-race young men. As a black man as well as a journalist, I wanted to understand what lay behind such attacks. So I spoke to victims, groups of black and mixed-race teenagers, youth and social workers and community leaders.</p>
<p>The groups of young men I met in London expressed some profoundly disturbing attitudes towards girls and sex. The boys explained how they make arrangements for &#8220;line-ups&#8221; in which one girl has oral sex with up to six or seven of them at one time. These arrangements might be made at school or on mobile phones.</p>
<p>Sometimes these girls initially consent because they want to be popular. But these events can spiral into rape because the boys consider that any girl who is prepared to agree to a line-up can be considered fair game. One boy told me: &#8220;If she wants to go and meet a bag of boys then she&rsquo;s probably a jezzie [slut], and if she&rsquo;s going to a house it&rsquo;s over  &mdash;  she&rsquo;s going to get beaten [have sex].&#8221;</p>
<p>In other instances, as some of the victims in our film describe, girls can unwittingly walk into a trap, innocently visiting someone&rsquo;s house to listen to music or watch a film only to discover that a group of boys are lying in wait. Or they might be hanging out with friends in a park and suddenly realise they have become surrounded by a group of boys intent on sex.</p>
<p>For both boys and girls, the line between this sort of group sex and rape seems to be blurred. A girl might agree to have oral sex with two or three boys but then be ordered to have sex with six or seven. The teenage girls I met told me that boys simply don&rsquo;t understand what rape is. And yet this is a crime that can ruin lives and is punishable by life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Occasionally gang rape is used to punish a girl for minor transgressions against gang members. In one of my most shocking interviews, I met a girl who admitted she had helped to set up girls for gang rape. As the girlfriend of a gang member, she organised these rapes, partly out of fear and partly to fit in.</p>
<p>She admitted she was terrified of being raped herself and had walked away when witnessing a girl being gang-raped at a party because she feared she might be next: &#8220;There was just loads of boys and the girl&rsquo;s tights were ripped up, like, she was bleeding as well, because I think she was a virgin, and they were just taking turns on her basically, and she was crying, and I didn&rsquo;t get involved because I thought if I get involved they&rsquo;re gonna turn on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victims&rsquo; descriptions of their attacks are horrific. One young victim likened her attack to being &#8220;pulled and pushed around like a rag doll&#8221;, while another 14-year-old girl described her ordeal when she was gang raped by a total of nine boys who told her that she was not the only girl they had attacked. In that case, nine boys were subsequently convicted of raping her. The youngest perpetrator was just 12 years old.</p>
<p>I found there was concern among black communities about this violence. The Rev Joyce Daley, from the Black Parents Forum in Hackney, told me that gang rape is not a rare or one-off phenomenon. It is happening on a regular basis. She said: &#8220;It could actually explode on our very streets.&#8221; Steve Griffith, a youth worker in King&rsquo;s Cross, said: &#8220;I see too much abuse of young women on the streets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gang rape, while constituting only a tiny percentage of all rapes in the UK, is a horrible reality in this country. The nature of the crime is so appalling that much more research needs to be carried out into its causes. But what seems evident from my investigation is that the key to preventing it will be changing the way young men view women and the kind of group sexual activity they are engaging in at such a young age.</p>
<p>Sheldon Thomas, a youth worker in Brixton, said: &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got a generation that looks at sex as if it&rsquo;s nothing, and treats disrespecting women as if it&rsquo;s nothing. These guys are like 13, 14 and 15, and their actual attitudes towards young girls  &mdash;  towards sex  &mdash;  is mind-blowing. It&rsquo;s actually leaving you asking: where are their morals, where are their values?&#8221;<br>

		<p>Another thing about black men and rape that jumps out at me is this   &mdash;   whenever I hear about an exceedingly elderly woman being raped, it&rsquo;s always by a young black man.  While there are rapists of all ages and all races, I can&rsquo;t understand that in particular.</p>

		<p>&#8220;where are their morals, where are their values?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their morals and values are ingrained in their genome, just like our morals and values are in ours.  The twain shall never meet.</p>
<p>Blacks are a scourge upon every community they enter, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s Senegal or the UK.  What were the British thinking when they invited blacks into their country?  As Enoch Powell said:  &#8220;We must be mad, literally mad!&#8221;</p>
<p>The only answer is to deport them back to where they came from.  Blacks do not historically belong in the UK and cannot be allowed to stay there.  Alternatively, blacks could be allowed to stay if they agreed to not reproduce, thus at least giving some horizon where Europe will be free of non-white crime once again.  Anything else is unacceptable.</p>

		<p>This is typical behavior among blacks everywhere.  When they get into groups, blacks will act like a wild pack of dogs, egging each other on.  It&rsquo;s not the most civilized and intelligent black in the group that the other blacks try to copy, but instead they all lower themselves to the level of the worst behaving black among them.</p>

		<p>The tragedy is that, well-meaning as he might be, Mr. Somura is part of the problem.  Oh sure, he&rsquo;s not likely to rape anybody in Britain.  But his children, or grandchildren probably will.  He should return to Africa and try to make a difference there rather than participating in the colonization of Britain.</p>

i would hate to make light of this horrible reality white Britons now have to live with - but I can just see what the &#8216;solution&rsquo; is going to be, further effeminizing and berating WHITE britons -since the government will never admit that the problem is disproprtionally minority - the same way equal numbers of white are now stopped for &#8216;terrorist&rsquo; searches, equal numbers of whites will receive this &#8216;training&rsquo; which will do nothing to reduce the number of gang rapes.</p>
<p><b>there is only one thing that will reduce the number of gang rapes - reducing the number of minorities in britian</b></p>

		<p>No, it is more of an act of war in a defeated nation of the original inhabitants that happen to be white! This is NOT just occurring in Britain either. It is occurring to every White Western Nation that has allowed the non-white population in and stay. </p>
<p>The gang rapes signify the power of the new rulers, per say to the nation spoils of war and that happens to be the rape white woman to let the &#8220;white men&#8221; in the nation no who&rsquo;s boss now. </p>

		<p>Is anyone really shocked by this?  It is not a cultural phenomenon, but a genetic one. Black men are animals from a very young age intent on passing on an inferior genetic code in the only way they have available and that is violence. Just like their chimpanzee cousins, they rape in gangs.  It is their instinct and the real crime is that governments around the world subject white women and girls to the violence that is endemic to blacks, arabs, and south asians.  </p>

<p>Um, no study required. Chart the increase in non-white population in Britain over the last 40 years. This likely corelates with the incidence of gang rapes. My guess is that every formerly White and White-governed nation would find the same results.</p>

		<p>Gang Rape: Is It a Race Issue?</p>
<p>I know that this is the sort of question that really irritates anyone who&rsquo;s is right-wing, race-realist inclined.<br>
When all the data presented shows the perps are in the majority of one race.</p>
<p>Quick and odvious answer is yes.<br>
&#8220;If the pond is full of ducks, it&rsquo;s a duck pond&#8221;.(Variation on &#8221; if it walks like a duck&#8221;).<br>
But that would be too simple, let&rsquo;s spend trillions of dollars to come to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s environmental, chemical and physiological etc. so really the rapists are the victims.<br>
Gang rape is a weapon of war.<br>
The Maori gangs of NZ in 1970&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s were prevalent perputrators of these crimes.<br>
They callously refered to the act as &#8216;cabbaging&rsquo; because they thought the act would turn the victim into a &#8216;vegetable&rsquo;, i.e. a physiologically broken, easily manipulated, soulless shell of a person who was in essence gang property from then on. <br>
And of course there the African penchant for mutalating their poor victims after the act, what is that about?<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/mg9cgf" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/mg9cgf</a></p>
<p>Another angle in working out why is looking at the age that puberty is reached, interestingily <br>
 white females are going through puberty earlier and earlier, where American American girls are starting later (though are still the earliest group to start the process).<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/lskd26" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/lskd26</a></p>
<p>As a father of a young girl, I&rsquo;ve always thought(like most other parents) &#8220;if anyone touched my little girl I&rsquo;d&hellip;.&#8221;.<br>
Well don&rsquo;t bother, if you do avenge the crime the courts will just lock you up and release the rapist.<br>

		<p>The solution: population exchange with Africa.  Send blacks to Rhodesia, South Africa, Kenya, etc. while bringing the British populations of those countries home to the UK.</p>
<p>The Dutch could do the same with their blacks, exchange them for Afrikaners.  Even if it is against the will of the people involved.  It just makes sense.  Why bring in racial groups that drag your society down while allowing your brothers and sisters overseas to be slaughtered?<br>

		<p>Whites commit crimes, although at a much lower rate, but whites almost never, ever, commit one of &#8216;group crimes&rsquo;. You can blame this on &#8216;gangs&rsquo; all you want, but these &#8216;pack crimes&rsquo; go on with regularity in places where there are no gangs at all. </p>

<p><i>&#8220;The fact is that Whites commit more rapes thatn Blacks. Histoyry shows this. It is just covered up b the mainstream media more.</i></p>
<p>Thanks, Thad, not only for your dazzling rhetorical skills, but also for proving once again that our darker cousins (okay, I&rsquo;m guessing) don&rsquo;t have the brainpower necessary to grasp the concept of proportion. I&rsquo;d try to explain, but I think I&rsquo;d have an easier time teaching my cat to do the crossword puzzle.</p>
<p>You know, for years I thought that African crime was largely limited to American blacks, maybe because the Africans I met were cream-of-the-crop types who were actually motivated to escape their native hellholes and come to America and make something of themselves. Not to mention the fact that I was as brainwashed as the next lefty and wanted nothing more than to believe that blacks were just like everyone else and just got the poo end of the stick, a few bad apples, blah, blah, blah. What a moron I was. I can&rsquo;t believe it took me over 40 years to wake up to the truth. To wit: there is something deeply, intrinsically wrong with all but a vanishingly small proportion of Africans. It still makes me feel bad to say it, but there it is. As horrifying as stories like these are, at least there&rsquo;s a small possibility they&rsquo;ll wake some people up. Right? </p>

		<p>Question Diversity, the elderly aren&rsquo;t the only ones. Every incident I have ever had the misfortune of hearing concerning the rape of dogs (yes, canines) has ALWAYS had a black perpetrator. Five times now, I have stumbled upon a news story about some poor dog that was raped by a black and has died of it&rsquo;s injuries, or is recovering, thanks to well-meaning white people. One story I saw on Animal Planet, I think, showed a black woman talking about her dog that was raped and she caught the black perp in the act. The dog was mortally injured, and died two weeks later. She never even bothered to take it to a vet. I remember her words with revulsion: &#8220;It sho&rsquo; was hard watchin&rsquo; dat dog die!&#8221; What is wrong with these people?!!!!</p>

<p>Most rapists of elderly women are fairly young men just starting out on their life of crime.  They chose the elderly woman as she will be most defenseless and easily conquered.  As they learn their craft, gain confidence, and lay down their procedure/M.O., they will start to move down into lower age cohorts in search of newer/more victims.</p>
<p>Once a sexual pattern is established, it is very hard to break.  After the first victim, do they stop after fifty victims? No.  After 500?  No.  Arrest them, convict them and lock them up for life.</p>

		<p>What I want to know is, why is it that the &#8220;whitest&#8221; authors are always black.  Jesse Lee Peterson, this guy, Walter Williams, Sowell, etc.  I just don&rsquo;t get it, these people are going to be completely vilified, ridiculed, called sellouts, and maybe physically attacked by their own people, in addition to all but the latter by liberal whites, yet they continue to write the truth.  </p>
<p>Our writers on the other hand, if they are not Stormfront types, seem absolutely terrified of a little ostracism and ridicule. </p>

Another thing about black men and rape that jumps out at me is this  &mdash;  whenever I hear about an exceedingly elderly woman being raped, it&rsquo;s always by a young black man. While there are rapists of all ages and all races, I can&rsquo;t understand that in particular.</p>
<p>Question,</p>
<p>Many of them are employed in Nursing Homes and in Assisted Living facilities. I&rsquo;ve personally read of several cases where they rape Alzheimers victims in their nineties. <br>
And we&rsquo;re forced to share the same air with these fiends!!!<br>

		<p>because the US has been plagued by high rates of minority crime for decades, few Americans appreciate just how QUICKLY Europe was transformed from a place with very little violent crime to a place where Europeans are regularly slaughtered in the streets by Africans, Arabs, etc..</p>
<p>the transition took about 15 years, and I watched it from a front row seat.</p>
<p>if you want to know what Western Europe is like up until the early 90s, think midsized Midwestern town ca the 1940s.</p>
<p>Europeans are now rediscovering their instinct for self-preservation.</p>

<p>I beg to differ (with you and many others). A man is the master of his own destiny; at his birth he is imbued with certain qualities. They are his &#8220;starting cards&#8221;. How he play them is up to him. During the first few years, the hand playing the cards are those of the parents; they shape his thoughts and aspirations. If this man is a good father and instills his rather admirable values in his children and they do the same, then I&rsquo;m quite certain everything will be fine.</p>

		<p>This is probably the equivalent of what black&rsquo;s in the American South call a train. In this act of high culture a young woman is lured somewhere and gang raped by multiple men. As far as I know the woman is almost always black. Not that this makes it any better. But it seems to be accepted as part of the culture in the Black South. I just can&rsquo;t imagine any White community in the North or South putting up with such depravity involving all white&rsquo;s. </p>

		<p>I am a White woman in my mid forties and my earliest memories of interacting with blacks are from elementary school in the sixties when integration was forced on us. The seven to nine year old black boys in my second grade class routinely molested the White girls every chance they got. They would crawl under the desks to look up your skirt, they would grab your crotch or rub theirs up against you if they saw an opportunity. And a group of about 4 of them would target a different White girl to threaten during recess every week. I became aware at that young age, that this kind of behavior was inborn in them. Who should I thank for these fond memories of the joys of diversity?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure there is some non-racial excuse for gang-rape. Vitamin D deficiency, warrior genes, having your magical ancient African kingdoms and inventions stolens, etc.</p>
<p>If not that, then it must be a cultural misunderstanding. Maybe whites just need to be educated that gang rape is a by-product of living in a vibrant, multicultural rainbow utopia society. Victims shouldn&rsquo;t be angry, they should be happy that they got to experience diversity.</p>

<p>1. Blacks may give them some heat, but the power of blacks is extremely limited.  They can expect little more than some nasty emails and snubbing from militant black acquaintances.</p>
<p>2. Blacks get a pass from whites, period.  It takes a LOT to overcome this ancestral privilege.  So the liberal white supremacist power structure, which is quite the opposite of &#8220;extremely limited,&#8221; will do nothing to such dissenters.</p>
<p>3. Blacks are used to speaking their minds on race and there are fewer controls in place to keep them on the plantation.  When they do wander off, they&rsquo;re free to say what they want.  The idea that blacks are free to speak frankly about race is ingrained in the minds of both races and can easily become a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>In short, they do it because they&rsquo;re allowed to get away with it.  The gratitude from cowardly, but not-quite-totally-servile whites might easily outweigh the opprobrium from blacks.</p>

They certainly commit the lion&rsquo;s share of inter-racial rapes. Look at ANYTHING regarding sex that is a negative. Blacks wil be at the very top of the chart. Illegitimacy? Check. STD&rsquo;s?

<p>Most Europeans knowledge re  American blacks probably came from watching &#8216;The Cosby Show&#8221;, Michael Jordan in the NBA and reading Gunnar Myrdahl&rsquo;s treatise on &#8220;white racism in America&rsquo;, the exact name of which escapes me. It was written in the 1940&rsquo;s.<br>

<p>Each year in America 20,000 white women are raped by black men. Each year in America 200 white men rape black women. 0 gang rapes. Blacks make up 14% of the US population. This makes any given black men approximately 600 times more likely to commit one of these sexual race crimes. As far a &#8216;covering up&rsquo; the facts, they certainly didn&rsquo;t cover up the Duke University rape case, it was given national coverage and held up (with a straight face) as an example of, well, the lie you apparently believe.

		<p>I&rsquo;ll bet my top dollar that most perpetrators of gang rape (or rape in general) come from dysfunctional homes. It&rsquo;s not a quirk that the rise in social pathologies in the African  American community coincides with the social dilapidation of the African American household. Family matters!</p>

		<p>I remember back in 1966 when i was thirteen years old, on Holloween night, i witnessed, from a considerable distance, a black teenage gang assault (i&rsquo;m not sure if rape was involved,) on a small group of white teenage girls, whom i believe were from a local girls home in my hometown. It happened at all places, in the back of an old Elks Lodge building in the downtown area. </p>
<p>To this day, i remember the traumatized look on one of the assaulted girls face as she walked from the back of the building, crying out to her friends.</p>
<p>And as i look back now, that was the beginning of the end in my hometown, as blacks started to really populate and take over. Scary, like that Holloween night.  </p>

		<p>Teacher raped by 15-year-old pupil blames school for &#8216;putting her in the way of a rapist&rsquo;<br>
By Daily Mail Reporter<br>
Last updated at 11:06 PM on 23rd June 2009</p>
<p>A teacher who was brutally assaulted by a 15-year-old pupil accused the school where the attack took place of &#8216;putting her in the way of a rapist&rsquo;. The 32-year-old, who cannot be identified, said Westminster City School should have warned her that it was unsafe for her to be in her classroom alone after lessons. The woman was attacked by powerfully-built Dwayne Best as she marked books after school - within a week of starting her job in September, 2004. Best is serving a life sentence after being convicted at the Old Bailey. Miss X sued the governing body of the school over her &#8216;truly horrifying&rsquo; ordeal. She has reached a secret settlement in the damages action. Her counsel, Neil Block QC, told Mr Justice Foskett at London&rsquo;s High Court that her allegations of negligence against the school were on the basis that there had been a previous less serious sexual assault on a cleaner.<br>
Best also had the &#8216;most appalling&rsquo; documented history in and out of school, displaying a belligerent and aggressive attitude.Speaking after the case, Miss X said she had decided to bring a civil case because she thought the school should be held to account for their failings. &#8216;They really failed. They let me down and I do hold them responsible for putting me in the way of a rapist.&rsquo; She said that the school had a duty of care to its employees under health and safety law which had not been followed.The school should have carried out a risk assessment after the cleaner had been attacked, Miss X said.&rsquo;Nobody warned me. On a basic level that&rsquo;s what it comes down to, if they had warned me, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been there in the classroom.&rsquo;I take my own safety very seriously and I always have. I don&rsquo;t put myself in those kind of positions.&rsquo;Somebody else put me in the way of a rapist, that infuriates me intensely. Everybody has the right, not only to not be raped, but to make decisions about their own safety.&rsquo;Miss X said that Best&rsquo;s school records showed a &#8216;degenerative&rsquo; pattern of behaviour that the school should have picked up on.  &#8216;It was really bad management. If you have pupils who are in need of structure and behavioural management then you have in place policies and structures for teachers to use.&rsquo; Best&rsquo;s continually disruptive behaviour meant he should have been excluded, she said.&rsquo;If they had done right by me, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been there, and if they had done right by him, he was entitled to be properly managed, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been there. &#8216;It&rsquo;s very sad that nobody valued my life enough to take one or two simple steps, that&rsquo;s one of the most depressing aspects of the case.&rsquo; Miss X said she hoped that her case would make schools go back and look again at their policies and risk assessments to make sure they are doing what they can to keep their staff safe. Miss X has not returned to teaching since the attack. She said: &#8216;Being raped and losing my job was like being bereaved. I lost a thing I loved doing. It was devastating. I lost myself.&rsquo; Miss X said she was now looking forward to the future, with hopes of setting up her own business and starting a family.</p>
<p>Mr Block told the court today that the two sides had agreed that as there had been a &#8216;generous award in another jurisdiction&rsquo; to Miss X, the current proceedings should be stayed on confidential terms with the school paying her costs. The judge said it was very much to her credit that she wanted to use material from the case to ensure other people did not have to go through the same ordeal, and wished her well for the future. A spokesman for Westminster City School said: &#8216;This incident took place at the school five years ago. It was a highly unusual case which could not have been foreseen by the school. Neither was this incident the fault of the school. &#8216;Both parties have now resolved this matter and are not at liberty to provide any further information.&rsquo;</p>

Maybe The Independent didn&rsquo;t want too many people watching it. You can get a streamed version on the internet but I&rsquo;m not sure whether it&rsquo;s available worldwide.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Channel 4 broadcast another documentary on exactly the same subject. It was made by Darcus Howe, another black man, and was unable at that time to find any instances of white on black gang rape.</p>

<p>Dear Yorkshireman,</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.  We here &#8220;across the pond&#8221; appreciate your postings and witness - do it more often!</p>
<p>Perhaps Teacher X ought to sue the Parlement, etc., along with the parents of all these girls who have been raped and beaten, etc., along with all the other violent crime victims for failing to protect the indigenous British population from third world barbarians.</p>
<p>Ultimately our governments have to take responsibility for letting so many of us suffer the crimes of immigrants when it rises as high as it has in some parts of Europe and North America.  As much as it seems like an outlandish idea, it is one of the basic reasons for paying taxes and having a government at all.</p>

		<p>I watched that programme and found that the truth was bent a good deal which then again, is no surprise on account of the programme script writer being a black and one not even born in the UK either, but rather on the African continent. </p>
<p>The reason I found it biased is because there was very little reference made to the fact that the vast majority of rapes are perpetrated by blacks on indigenous whites.</p>
<p>At one point, Samura was filmed interviewing a white couple whose daughter had been a victim of gang rape, not by blacks but by white youths.  </p>
<p>While the trauma of rape is still the same regardless of the race of the perp(s), nonetheless, it was telling how this part of the documentary was crouched in such a way as to to avoid highlighting the real facts, ie, that blacks are the majority perps of rape in every white European country where there is a sizeable population of them residing, followed closely by Asian Muslims. </p>
<p>I noted also that in cases where the perps were known to be black, practically all the victims were depicted as black or Mulatto females, again not a truthful reflection of the real facts which are that it is white females who form the majority of victims of racist black rape crime.<br>

		<p>Samura has admitted that a disproportionate number of blacks are committing gang rape, but omitted to state that the majority of their victims are white.  No mention was made of what race commits the most solo rape incidents.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;d forgotten that the so-called white gang rapists were mainly mixed-race with only one actual white amongst them.</p>
<p>It is known to be a fact that in majority black areas, white youth have no option but to join black gangs and emulate black behaviour/culture or be singled out for racist criminal assault and even murder.</p>
