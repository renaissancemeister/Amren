<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31128684/">Boys With &#8216;Warrior Gene&rsquo; Likely to Join Gangs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, June 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Boys who have a so-called &#8220;warrior gene&#8221; are more likely to join gangs and also more likely to be among the most violent members and to use weapons, a new study finds.</p>
<p>&#8220;While gangs typically have been regarded as a sociological phenomenon, our investigation shows that variants of a specific MAOA gene, known as a &#8216;low-activity 3-repeat allele,&rsquo; play a significant role,&#8221; said biosocial criminologist Kevin M. Beaver of Florida State University.</p>
<p>In 2006, the controversial warrior gene was implicated in the violence of the indigenous Maori people in New Zealand, a claim that Maori leaders dismissed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Previous research has linked low-activity MAOA variants to a wide range of antisocial, even violent, behavior, but our study confirms that these variants can predict gang membership,&#8221; says Beaver, the Florida State researcher. &#8220;Moreover, we found that variants of this gene could distinguish gang members who were markedly more likely to behave violently and use weapons from members who were less likely to do either.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Violent traits are hereditary</b></p>
<p>The MAOA gene affects levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin that are related to mood and behavior, and those variants that are related to violence are hereditary, according to a statement from the university.</p>
<p>The new study examined DNA data and lifestyle information drawn from more than 2,500 respondents to the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Beaver and colleagues from Florida State, Iowa State and Saint Louis universities will detail their findings in a forthcoming issue of the journal Comprehensive Psychiatry.</p>

		<p>Fine, they&rsquo;ve found the MAOA gene.  But does it have any racial differences?  It being a gene, it is definitely heritable.  Another question:  How does epigenetics play into this gene&rsquo;s expression?</p>

		<p>I wonder if a variant of this gene could be found in Germanic and Nordic people, specifically, my younger brother. Of course, my brother put his agressive tendencies to good use in the U.S. Army, and not a gang, and the army taught him the discipline he needed to harness his agression.</p>

<p>Ah, yes.  More euphemisms by the left to describe a condition  that is filled with primitive savagery, which is inconducive to building civilizations and organizing peaceful communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Warrior genes&#8221; sounds so much better than &#8220;primitive tendencies&#8221; in people who have not yet evolved above the hunter-gatherer stage and are not suitable for civilized communities, but are cursed to remain as tribal organizers.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The MAOA gene affects levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin that are related to mood and behavior, and those variants that are related to violence are hereditary, according to a statement from the university.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly, dopamine is the neurotransmitter that is excited and released when pleasurable activities are engaged in; it is sort of like your body&rsquo;s naturally occurring &ldquo;happy juice.&rdquo; Dopamine is also one of the primary neurotransmitters that is released (along with adrenaline) when you ingest cocaine. It is not surprising that if there is a link to the MAOA gene and violence, in conjunction with dopamine release, that it could produce a cycle of aberrant activity and subsequent emotional rewards in the antisocial. In short, it would endlessly encourage such deviant behaviors in a &ldquo;feedback loop&rdquo; of sorts for psychopathic individuals; it could best be described, as a violence or criminal &ldquo;high.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Maori aside, racial differences in such matters are unlikely to be researched (let alone reported on) in the near future. However, the data is of value from a criminal justice perspective. It does give you an insight as to why some individuals seem to thrive on the: illegal, depraved, and outright degenerate. </p>
<p>Just something to think about,</p>

		<p>The functional polymorphism on the MAO-A gene (monoamine-oxidase A, a neurotransmitter) is prevalent in on the order of 60% in Maoris and pure Bantu. This means it must have been a huge selective advantage. Violence gets you the women, pure and simple. It also gets you killed. Why is this gene variant practically nonexistent elsewhere?<br>
As I futilely tried to explain to OCCAM, there is intraspecific and extraspecific evolution. Harsh conditions selected for cooperation. Now we have eliminated external selection pressure (through civilisation, by the cooperative) the cooperative are helpless against the &#8220;warriors&#8221;.</p>

		<p>11 HH: Maybe they call it a &#8220;warrior gene&#8221; to get the idea past the PC filters.  I noticed when reading about scientific evidence of gender differences in brain structure, the scientists were quick to say that despite the differences, male and female brains work exactly the same way.  Or when scientists say there&rsquo;s no such thing as race, and then substitute the phrase &#8220;population groups&#8221;.  I think that most scientists know the truth, and know how they have to camoflage it to get it past the censors.  </p>

		<p>Since the word &#8220;Warrior&#8221; has been romanticized and removed from application to White men (White women are often Warriors too, you knnow), no word exists to describe the White tendancy to fight and defend his own people - except Chivalric Gentleman.

		<p>The movie &#8220;Once Were Warriors&#8221; shows the stupidity and pointlessness of violence in Maori culture these days.</p>
<p>All societies suppress violence between members and direct the aggression outwards. Show me any society in the world that doesn&rsquo;t do that. Too many whites live in a dream land where they think because they personally have never even been in a fist fight, they think they are part of a nonviolent utopia. This thinking is up there with vegetarians who think that if they never personally see blood or meat, that the wildlife habitat destroyed to farm their tofu never happened. The arrogant naivete of this kind of thinking baffles me. </p>
<p>Law and order in every society in the world exists only because of violent men who protect their own society according to rules accepted and established in that society. Is that not obvious? </p>
<p>Gangs are just another kind of militia. They function like any other fighting force, with internal disciplines and yes violence against outsiders. Looking at it as abstract &#8220;Violence&#8221; is just dim fantasyland thinking that is far too common among fantasyland whites. Call it what it is: militias, armies. That is what gangs are. </p>

		<p>The movie &#8220;Once Were Warriors&#8221; shows the kind of senseless violence that fills the lives of Maoris these days. Is this a &#8220;warrior&#8221; gene, or a &#8220;mayhem&#8221; gene? </p>
<p>&#8220;Warrior&#8221; gene my foot, as if New Zealand was won by asking &#8220;pretty please.&#8221; What rubbish. As if New Zealand has no police and no army. </p>
<p>There is no nonviolent civilization. There is no country without warriors protecting its laws, its borders, its civilized community. We all owe our daily safety in the West to warriors in our armed forces and officers of the law who put their lives at risk so we can be live in an orderly society. Any belief otherwise is idiotic. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Should white racists find that the so-called &ldquo;warrior&rdquo; gene predominates white population, they&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;See that&rsquo;s why we are on top right now.&rdquo; Should they find that it isn&rsquo;t prevalent in their populations, they&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;See that&rsquo;s why we are more civilized.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>For once, I agree with Black Insurgent. Black Insurgent, understand this. For some people, race isn&rsquo;t about belittling other people or disliking other people or about wanting to politically rule or dominate anyone. It&rsquo;s about recognizing that nature has made us in different ways and that each race has a right to live with their own kind and freely develop their own potentials as nature permits. That is all. </p>
<p>Black Insurgent is right that many readers at AmRen are also stuck in the petty thinking that if a non-white person does something it is automatically bad. If hispanics breed and have lots of babies when they are young and healthy, then whites are saints for not breeding until age 35. If arabs emphasize gender roles, then whites are saints for promoting gender neutrality. If non-whites join gangs, then whites are saints for being wimpy and unable to fend for themselves. If blacks physically chastise their misbehaving children, then whites are saints for pointless lecturing instead. </p>
<p>All this talk is petty and it is wrong. The fact is that whites still are the majority in America and have firstly ourselves to blame if we are not happy with the way things have turned out. </p>
<p>Black Insurgent, some whites think blacks deserve the same thing whites do. A place to call their own and be themselves with no apologies, no walking on eggshells, and no interference or meddling or belittling from anyone else. In short, a home. </p>

		<p>Again with the nonsense that black and Hispanic (and other) gang activity is akin to warfare.  It is not   &mdash;    You think the Crips and the Bloods banging each other in L.A. or MS-13 and Mara 18 doing it, are the Germans and French hauling grenaydes and firing canons toward each other across the Maginot Line?  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.  Gang violence is an occupational hazard, because the gangs are nothing more than drug distribution territorial protection groups.  </p>
<p>This is why I cringe when I hear (usually) black women bureaucrats, non-profit agency heads, etc. all for a &#8220;truce&#8221; in the gang wars.  First, as I just explained, it&rsquo;s not war.  Second, for you to tell them not to fight each other is tantamount to you telling them that they can&rsquo;t make a living.  Third, if you have the power to make the gangs stop shooting each other for 30 days, why not make it 60 days, 90 days, 365 days, forever?  Conversley, could you be charged as an accessory/inchoate in every gang crime that happened while you didn&rsquo;t call for a truce?  They don&rsquo;t have that power, it&rsquo;s a media PR.</p>
<p>Also, I doubt that actual gangs are the driving force behind most black crime.  Most of it I think is arguments over women, money, possessions.</p>

		<p>QD, you say gang fighting is not like warfare? You could not be more mistaken.</p>
<p>Right now, gangs in LA are engaged in successful ethnic cleansing campaigns. Not just over drug dealing turf, but to secure their neighborhoods for their own ethnic groups. They shoot teenage girls if they are the wrong color. </p>
<p>Your paradigm for understanding gangs is blacks. Wrong paradigm, because the US gang culture is dominated by browns. You think this is irrelevant to your life because they are just dealing drugs to other hoodlums? </p>
<p>I suppose you know nothing about the kidnapping for ransom trend that is already here in Phoenix, Arizona? Right now the browns have almost completed out-competing blacks in their own niches, and are expanding into new lines of business. They will proceed as they do in their own brown third world countries: buying politicians, buying police officers, buying judges, collecting &#8220;rent&#8221; (extortion) from everyone (of every color) living or doing business in their turf. </p>
<p>At some stage gangs move from quasi-military functions to quasi-governmental functions if you watch the progression. It only works in an absence of effective central authority. </p>

<p>I concur that talk about gangs is a smokescreen for a pervasive lawlessness among blacks. They have a sense of entitlement that drives them to take and take no matter who gets hurt. Combined with low IQ and no impulse control, these individuals should not be &#8220;mainstreamed&#8221; into the general society. Violence by blacks is not limited to actual gang members no more than a love of fast food and bling. </p>
