			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), June 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 85 Islamic sharia courts are operating in Britain, a study claimed yesterday.</p>
<p>The astonishing figure is 17 times higher than previously accepted.</p>
<p>The tribunals, working mainly from mosques, settle financial and family disputes according to religious principles. They lay down judgments which can be given full legal status if approved in national law courts.</p>
<p>However, they operate behind doors that are closed to independent observers and their decisions are likely to be unfair to women and backed by intimidation, a report by independent think-tank Civitas said.</p>
<p>Commentators on the influence of sharia law often count only the five courts in London, Manchester, Bradford, Birmingham and Nuneaton that are run by the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal, a body whose rulings are enforced through the state courts under the 1996 Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>But the study by academic and Islamic specialist Denis MacEoin estimates there are at least 85 working tribunals.</p>
<p>The spread of sharia law has become increasingly controversial since its role was backed last year by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams and Lord Phillips, the Lord Chief Justice who stepped down last October.</p>
<p>Dr Williams said a recognised role for sharia law seemed &#8216;unavoidable&rsquo; and Lord Phillips said there was no reason why decisions made on sharia principles should not be recognised by the national courts.</p>
<p>But the Civitas report said the principles on which sharia courts work are indicated by the fatwas  &mdash;  religious decrees  &mdash;  set out on websites run by British mosques.</p>
<p>Mr MacEoin said: &#8216;Among the rulings we find some that advise illegal actions and others that transgress human rights standards as applied by British courts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Examples set out in his study include a ruling that no Muslim woman may marry a non-Muslim man unless he converts to Islam and that any children of a woman who does should be taken from her until she marries a Muslim.</p>
<p>Further rulings, according to the report, approve polygamous marriage and enforce a woman&rsquo;s duty to have sex with her husband on his demand.</p>
<p>The report added: &#8216;The fact that so many sharia rulings in Britain relate to cases concerning divorce and custody of children is of particular concern, as women are not equal in sharia law, and sharia contains no specific commitment to the best interests of the child that is fundamental to family law in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8216;Under sharia, a male child belongs to the father after the age of seven, regardless of circumstances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It said: &#8216;Sharia courts operating in Britain may be handing down rulings that are inappropriate to this country because they are linked to elements in Islamic law that are seriously out of step with trends in Western legislation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The study pointed out that the House of Lords ruled in a child custody case last year that the sharia rules on the matter were &#8216;arbitrary and discriminatory&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And a 2003 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg said it was &#8216;difficult to declare one&rsquo;s respect for democracy and human rights while at the same time supporting a regime based on sharia, which clearly diverges from Convention values.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However last year Justice Minister Bridget Prentice told MPs that &#8216;if, in a family dispute  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the parties to a judgment in a sharia council wish to have this recognised by English authorities, they are at liberty to draft a consent order embodying the terms of the agreement and submit it to an English court.</p>
<p>&#8216;This allows judges to scrutinise it to ensure it complies with English legal tenets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Decisions from sharia tribunals can be presented to a family court judge for approval with no more detail than is necessary to complete a two page form. The sharia courts in the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal are recognised as courts under the Arbitration Act. This law, which covers Jewish Beth Din courts, gives legal powers to a tribunal if all parties involved accept its authority.</p>
<p>The Civitas study said the Islamic courts should no longer be recognised under British law.</p>
<p>Its director Dr David Green said: &#8216;The reality is that for many Muslims, sharia courts are in practice part of an institutionalised atmosphere of intimidation, backed by the ultimate sanction of a death threat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Muslim Council in Britain condemned the study for &rsquo; stirring up hatred&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8216;Sharia councils are perfectly legitimate. There is no evidence they are intimidating or discriminatory against women. The system is purely voluntary so if people don&rsquo;t like it they can go elsewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Patrick Mercer, Tory MP for Newark and chairman of the Commons counter-terrorism sub committee, said: &#8216;We have an established law of the land and a judiciary. Anything that operates otside that system must be viewed with great caution.</p>
<p>&#8216;If crimes are going unreported to police, this will erode the authority of those who have to enforce our law. In a sovereign state there must be one law, and one law only.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: &#8216;Everyone should be deeply concerned about the extent of these courts.</p>
<p>&#8216;They do entrench division in society, and do nothing to entrench integration or community cohesion. It leads to a segregated society.</p>
<p>&#8216;There should be one law, and that should be British law. We can&rsquo;t have a situation where people can choose which system of law they follow and which they do not.</p>
<p>&#8216;We can&rsquo;t have a situation where people choose the system of law which they feel gives them the best outcome. Everyone should equal under one law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Veteran Tory Lord Tebbit provoked anger among Muslims earlier this month by comparing Islamic sharia courts to gangsters.</p>
<p>He likened the tribunals to the &#8216;system of arbitration of disputes that was run by the Kray brothers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Lord Tebbit told the Lords: &#8216;Are you not aware that there is extreme pressure put upon vulnerable women to go through a form of arbitration that results in them being virtually precluded from access to British law?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Warning that women could be shut out from the protection of the law, he asked Justice Minister Lord Bach: &#8216;That is a difficult matter, I know, but how do you think we can help those who are put in that position?&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t the British government want diversity - well, man, they are going to get it- in terms of diverse court systems. After that, there will be Islamic political parties, and school systems (madrassas). I thiink there will even be Islamic currency apart from the pound. It will be apartheid based on Islamic vs. British customs. And to think they blame the BNP for &#8220;apartheid&#8221; manners, since the BNP does not accept minorities. That is nothing compared to what&rsquo;s coming down the pike. </p>

<p>What did the dim-bulb British expect when thay allowed this barbaric, third-world judicial system in the country that produced the concept of Common Law and the Magna Carta.  Empirically, there is no such evidence that moderate Islam exists and therefore it is incompatible with Western Civilization.</p>

<p>Sharia may be full of monstrous idiocies, but it&rsquo;s spot-on on this point.  This isn&rsquo;t all that different from what our own law used to say.  Older children need a firm male hand, preferably a related one.</p>
<p>The late Daniel Amneus argued that when divorce law favored the husband, the divorce rate was low.  When the pendulum swung to the distaff side is when family breakup went through the roof.

		<p>The majority of British and European people never wanted Third World immigrants in the first place. Many Brits - and Irish - are migrating to Australia because (according to every one I have spoken to) they no longer see a future for their children in their native land - something like two million British people have left the UK forever over the past 10 years. It seems to me that governments in every Western country are becoming more and more remote from the people and their wishes with every passing year. My daughter works and lives in Europe right now, she is appalled at the number of burkha-clad women and the number of places she has been warned not to venture into because of the takeover by Islamic barbarians. The people of the UK and Europe never signed up for this, the situation was forced upon them, just as the invasion by Hispanic illegals is being forced upon you Americans. I think the Muslim situation in Europe will be resolved one way or the other over the next 5-10 years. It takes Western Europeans a long time to be outraged enough to act - but when they do, watch out.</p>

		<p>I do not see these Islamic courts as being any threat as long as it is recognized that no one can be forced to use them and, legally, civil law always trumps religious law.</p>
<p>Every major city in this country has RC Courts of Canon Law and Jewish Beth Din.  The work of these courts often greatly simplify what has to be done in civil courts, particularly in domestic cases.</p>
<p>For the time being, I will withhold judgment on sharia law, but I will be keeping an eye on them.</p>

		<p>If Muslims must be in England, then I support everything that keeps them unassimilated, alien, and separate from British society. By all means, encourage them to keep their alien cultures and religions, which teach them that everyone else&rsquo;s way of life is inferior and to isolate themselves from them. This is a great help until the immigration issue can be properly dealt with.</p>

		<p>I wish I could share your optimism (or is it taqiyya?), Allan (are you sure that isn&rsquo;t Ahmed?), but Catholic Canon Law and Jewish Beth Din apply only to their own religions.</p>
<p>As far as Muslims are concerned, however, the writ of Sharia runs everywhere, and affects non-Muslims as much as (indeed more, given the imbalance of rights in an Islamic society) than Muslims.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are (as I suggested) a Muslim troll, but if you are merely a Western dupe of Islam, I suggest you read the works of Robert Spencer, Serge Trifkovic, Bat Ye&rsquo;or, Oriana Fallaci and Ibn Warraq, and watch the &#8220;Islam: What The West Needs To Know&#8221; documentary posted (in six parts) on YouTube.</p>
<p>This is the thin end of a very evil wedge.</p>

<p>While I agree that children need a firm male hand from their fathers, I don&rsquo;t believe that the child belongs to the father as the mother gives birth to him. It should be a joint effort. He should belong only to the father when only the father gives birth to him!!!!</p>

<p>Disagree with this totally. Divorce and subsquent family breakup occured because during WW2, many people married in haste and later found it didn&rsquo;t work. Also, as time passed, attitude towards divorce, like a lot of things changed and liberalized. Divorce became something that was no longer a stigma and people, both men and women, didn&rsquo;t want to be stuck in unhappy marriages.  As a result, divorce laws liberalized. As the result of these changes, divorce rates increased. It was very wrong that the law in the past gave women little power. There should be no power trip between the sexes.</p>

<p>#12, if this were the case, perhaps it would be viable BUT!! it is not the muslim agenda to be contained. The muslim agenda is to spread, by fire and sword if necessary, and to tolerate no non muslims in the new muslim world. I know these people.</p>
