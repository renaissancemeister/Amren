<h1>YWC Adviser Steps Down</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Harrell, Daily Tar Heel (University of North Carolina), June 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The fate of UNC&rsquo;s chapter of Youth for Western Civilization is up in the air.</p>
<p>Chris Clemens, the astronomy professor who serves as the group&rsquo;s faculty adviser, said he&rsquo;s decided not to continue in the role next year.</p>
<p>Once Clemens is officially gone, YWC will have 30 days to find a new faculty adviser before they are no longer an official campus organization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Instead, Clemens has offered to either sponsor a new group with the same mission but no affiliation with YWC, or help find a new sponsor.</p>
<p>But the second option could be difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know who I would start with,&#8221; Clemens said. &#8220;I only know one other conservative faculty member.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clemens stressed he is not passing judgment on the national organization itself but the reputation it has gained in the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a magnet for the radical left to come shut you down,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The name has become an obstacle to constructive dialogue.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Riley Matheson, former president and founder of UNC&rsquo;s chapter, and YWC founder Kevin DeAnna said they have seen interest in the group rise because of the protests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time there is one of the usual left-wing hit pieces, mostly with stuff just made up, we get more members and donations,&#8221; DeAnna said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Matheson said his chapter of YWC had eight to 10 members. DeAnna said 10 is the average number of members for the seven or so chapters across the nation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The arrested protestors and their supporters have called for the YWC group on campus to be dissolved.</p>
<p>Jon Curtis, associate director for student activities and student organizations, said it would be illegal to dissolve a group unless it violates University policy or loses its adviser.</p>

		<p>While I like YWC, and like what they do, this shows the disadvantages of having organizations around colleges.  Students graduate eventually, and professors become disinterested or intimidated.  This is why the Council of Conservative Citizens, upon the advice of yours truly, does not start campus chapters.  But the Council is more than happy to welcome college students to mainstream Council chapters in the communities where they go to school, if there is a chapter in the area.</p>

		<p>SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;.The YWC will be dissolved, no tenured staff will want to risk their future retirement or career, by sponsoring such a group. A sad statement, but true for the moment.</p>

<p>Hey Professor Clemens, since when could anyone have &ldquo;constructive dialogue&rdquo; with Multi Cult maniacs and Red freaks anyway?</p>
<p>This is just a copout on Dr. Clemens&rsquo; part and nothing more; it is all well and good, that he has had enough of their hysterically fabricated attacks and other nonsense, but he should simply say that flat out. He most certainly should not insinuate that the Youth for Western Civilization has any fault at all here, which he is clearly doing. He needs to man-up and put the blame where it belongs fully.  </p>
<p>Or put another way, he may not like the heat the kitchen generates, but he shouldn&rsquo;t blame the knives and forks for it!</p>

		<p>Thanks, Professor Clemens. Thanks for your not being strong. Thanks for succumbing to the pressure of &#8220;the radical left.&#8221; As a matter of fact, you&rsquo;re setting a great precedent for the future generation of conservatives: Yield to the pressure of radicals. Don&rsquo;t be too honest about your beliefs. Don&rsquo;t stand up for what you really believe in. And, above all, don&rsquo;t fight to save the West. Don&rsquo;t even use the term &#8220;Western civilization&#8221; unless you are trashing Western civilization.</p>
<p>How stupid do you think we are, Clemens? It&rsquo;s clear that you too consider YWC a &#8220;racist&#8221; hate group, and therefore don&rsquo;t want to be affiliated with them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real shame that one of the two &#8220;conservative&#8221; professors at UNC is not willing to keep YWC alive, seeing that YWC holds pretty basic conservative beliefs. You&rsquo;re a tenured professor at this point, so you really don&rsquo;t have much to lose by being affiliated with them. Even if you are so liberal as to think that YWC is an extremist group, you ought to have the decency of at least keeping them alive. That&rsquo;s what a real conservative would do.</p>

		<p>There are so few faculty members to the right of Bill Clinton nowadays that I doubt that YWC will be able to find a replacement for Chris Clemens.  Too bad.  Now &#8220;Western Civilization&#8221; is &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Tomorrow the English language will be declared racist, to be replaced by Spanish.</p>

		<p>Why is anyone surprised?  Leftists have been breaking up political meetings on college campuses for decades.  What the YWC should do the next time its meeting is disrupted is crack a few Stalinist skulls.  This would earn the organization some respect.  Americans must once again fight for their rights.   </p>

		<p>      The average Academic is dancing for his dinner; finger<br>
held up in the air to see which way the political wind is blow-<br>
ing. They deserve no respect whatsoever. As one French Pundit<br>
said long ago, the intellect is a whore. It will argue for what-<br>
ever it is told to argue for-in this case, which ever side but-<br>
ters the bread. <br>
      Tenure was supposed to protect against this type of thing,<br>
but it was seldom used. The professors never wanted to alienate<br>
thier peers. So tenure is gradually being discontinued. Academics<br>
are being turned into glorified temps. So, they deserve no res-<br>
pect and they&rsquo;re not getting any either. Nobody respects a sy-<br>
cophant.</p>

		<p>No doubt Clemens caught some flack. But if he didn&rsquo;t think he was up to it then he shouldn&rsquo;t have agreed to sponsor them in the first place.</p>

		<p>Professor Chris Clemens is a &#8220;Conservative&#8221;? What a panty waist. </p>
<p>This guy is a sad example of a man, especially one who calls himself Conservative. </p>
<p>Are there any real men left in this Country? We know that we won&rsquo;t find them on most College Campuses. </p>
<p>So, the Youth for Western Civilization, with all 10 members, is a great threat to the stability of Campus life. </p>
<p>What do these Students do when they take Western Civilzation I and II Classes? Just how do they cope with the guilt of it all?</p>
<p>How does the Socialist Faculty cope with teaching all the advancements that Western Civilization has brought to the world, without begging forgiveness from their Minority Students, for throwing these facts in their faces?</p>
<p>I have absolutely no hope, whatsoever, for this Country in its current condition. We are in the sewer, and this is where we will stay. </p>
<p>The next time you see a Liberal, thank him or her for the shape this Nation is in.<br>

		<p>Typical Conservative cowardice - talk a big game, parade around that you are the fighters/leaders for our people, civilization, then at the first sign of trouble, shouting disturbances from female Leftist of all things, the conservatives back down, they are concerned with their careers, reputations, would prefer to be out on the golf course.</p>
<p>Conservatives&hellip; too cowardly to fight, too fat to run.</p>

<p>I should think that even 10 members represent a substantial amount of $$$$$$ that could be better spent at ANOTHER COLLEGE!</p>

And if it is offered at UNC, it&rsquo;s probably presenting Western Civilization as &#8220;evil&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;militaristic&#8221; and ad naseum.</p>

		<p>The long march through the institutions is virtually complete.  The few remaining conservatives and rightists are petrified to make a stand and rock the boat and potentially jeopardize their careers.  Doesn&rsquo;t this just prove that racially conscious whites have no rights anymore and are second class citizens? </p>
<p>If pro-white organizations ever threatened members of leftist groups or attempted to disrupt their organizations the FBI and other federal goons would quickly intercede on behalf of the leftists.  The DOJ would charge them with civil rights violations and the offending members would be bankrupted at a best or facing prison at worst.  </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s right, Super Dave. But Ayers and Dohrn, who killed many in their bombing campaigns while in the Weather Underground, such as a San Francisco Police Officer, are tenured College Faculty, and Ayers even sits on the Board that approves Text Books for Primary, and Secondary, School children.</p>
<p>I would like to know why they were never tried and convicted, and got away without a punishment? </p>
