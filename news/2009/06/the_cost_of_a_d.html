			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruce Fleming, The Capital (Annapolis), June 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p> The Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead announced in Annapolis recently that &#8220;diversity is the number one priority&#8221; at the Naval Academy.</p>
<p>The Naval Academy superintendent, Vice Adm. Jeffrey Fowler, echoed him. Everyone understands that &#8220;diversity&#8221; here means nonwhite skins.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The stunning revelation last week was that the Naval Academy had an incoming class that was &#8220;more diverse&#8221; than ever before: 35 percent minority.</p>
<p>Sounds good, only this comes with a huge price tag. It&rsquo;s taxpayers who bankroll the military. Yet nobody has asked us if we&rsquo;re willing to pay this price. Instead we&rsquo;re being told there is no price to pay at all. {snip}</p>
<p>A &#8220;diverse&#8221; class does not mean the Naval Academy recruits violinists, or older students (they can&rsquo;t be 23 on Induction Day), or gay people (who are thrown out) or foreign students (other than the dozen or so sent by client governments).</p>
<p>It means applicants checked a box on their application that says they are Hispanic, African American, Native American, and now, since my time on the Admissions Board of the Academy, where I&rsquo;ve taught for 22 years, Asians.</p>
<p>Midshipmen are admitted by two tracks. White applicants out of high school who are not also athletic recruits typically need grades of A and B and minimum SAT scores of 600 on each part for the Board to vote them &#8220;qualified.&#8221; Athletics and leadership also count.</p>
<p>A vote of &#8220;qualified&#8221; for a white applicant doesn&rsquo;t mean s/he&rsquo;s coming, only that he or she can compete to win the &#8220;slate&#8221; of up to 10 nominations that (most typically) a Congress(wo)man draws up. That means that nine &#8220;qualified&#8221; white applicants are rejected. SAT scores below 600 or C grades almost always produce a vote of &#8220;not qualified&#8221; for white applicants.</p>
<p>Not so for an applicant who self-identifies as one of the minorities who are our &#8220;number one priority.&#8221; For them, another set of rules apply. Their cases are briefed separately to the board, and SAT scores to the mid-500s with quite a few Cs in classes (and no visible athletics or leadership) typically produce a vote of &#8220;qualified&#8221; for them, with direct admission to Annapolis. They&rsquo;re in, and are given a pro forma nomination to make it legit.</p>
<p>Minority applicants with scores and grades down to the 300s with Cs and Ds (and no particular leadership or athletics) also come, though after a remedial year at our taxpayer-supported remedial school, the Naval Academy Preparatory School.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Once at Annapolis, &#8220;diverse&#8221; midshipmen are over-represented in our pre-college classes, in lower-track courses, in mandatory tutoring programs and less challenging majors. Many struggle to master basic concepts. (I teach some of these courses.)</p>
<p>{snip} Despite being dragged toward the finish line, minorities graduate at about a 10 percent lower rate than the whole class, which of course includes them (so the real split is greater).</p>
