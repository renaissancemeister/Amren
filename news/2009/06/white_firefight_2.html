<h1>White Firefighters Win Supreme Court Appeal</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Sherman, AP, June 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Supreme Court ruled Monday that white firefighters in New Haven, Conn., were unfairly denied promotions because of their race, reversing a decision that high court nominee Sonia Sotomayor endorsed as an appeals court judge.</p>
<p>The ruling could alter employment practices nationwide and make it harder to prove discrimination when there is no evidence it was intentional.</p>
<p>New Haven was wrong to scrap a promotion exam because no African-Americans and only two Hispanic firefighters were likely to be made lieutenants or captains based on the results, the court said Monday in a 5-4 decision. The city said that it had acted to avoid a lawsuit from minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Monday&rsquo;s ruling, Justice Anthony Kennedy said, &#8220;Fear of litigation alone cannot justify an employer&rsquo;s reliance on race to the detriment of individuals who passed the examinations and qualified for promotions.&#8221; He was joined in the majority by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.</p>
<p>In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the white firefighters &#8220;understandably attract this court&rsquo;s sympathy. But they had no vested right to promotion. Nor have other persons received promotions in preference to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justices Souter, Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens signed onto Ginsburg&rsquo;s dissent, which she read aloud in court Monday. Speaking dismissively of the majority opinion, she predicted the court&rsquo;s ruling &#8220;will not have staying power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kennedy&rsquo;s opinion made only passing reference to the work of Sotomayor and the other two judges on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals who upheld a lower court ruling in favor of New Haven.</p>
<p>But the appellate judges have been criticized for producing a cursory opinion that failed to deal with &#8220;indisputably complex and far from well-settled&#8221; questions, in the words of another appeals court judge, Sotomayor mentor Jose Cabranes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said Sotomayor should not be criticized for the unsigned appeals court decision, which he asserted she did not write. &#8220;Judge Sotomayor and the lower court panel did what judges are supposed to do, they followed precedent,&#8221; said the Vermont Democrat who will preside over Sotomayor&rsquo;s confirmation hearings next month.</p>
<p>Leahy also called the high court decision &#8220;cramped&#8221; and wrong.</p>
<p>In New Haven, Nancy Ricci, whose son, Frank, was the lead plaintiff on the lawsuit, carried a large cake decorated with red, white and blue frosting into the law office where the firefighters were celebrating their victory.</p>
<p>The ruling is &#8220;a sign that individual achievement should not take a back seat to race or ethnicity,&#8221; said Karen Torre, the firefighters&rsquo; attorney. &#8220;I think the import of the decision is that cities cannot bow to politics and pressure and lobbying by special interest groups or act to achieve racial quotas.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a press conference on the steps of city hall in New Haven, firefighter Frank Ricci said the ruling showed that &#8220;if you work hard, you can succeed in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Until this decision, Ginsburg said, the civil rights law&rsquo;s prohibitions on intentional discrimination and disparate impact were complementary, both aimed at ending workplace discrimination. </p>
<p>&#8220;Today&rsquo;s decision sets these paired directives at odds,&#8221; she said. <br>

		<p>Comrade Chief Justice Ginsburg&rsquo;s dissent, is not surprising, given her record on racial issues. She also doesn&rsquo;t believe that the U.S. alone, should be in charge of its destiny, since she has bowed to international law, everytime it came into conflict with American law. These leftists will kill this free nation as sure as the sun rises every morning. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>

<p>Remember, Clinton put Ginsberg and Breyer on the Supreme Court.  All three are enemies of whites.  And, if it doesn&rsquo;t have staying power it&rsquo;s also because the Neocons have taken over the Republican Party.  But, I preduct, not for long.  Something has got to give.</p>
<p>Why is it that so many Jewish Americans work so hard to dispossess non-Jewish whites?  Do they think it will have no ramifications in the end?  Unfortunately, there aren&rsquo;t enough conservative American Jews, make that outspoken conservative American Jews, to offset a belief that is becoming more and more widespread among non-Jewish whites about Jews.  Please, will our Jewish comrades talk some sense into these people?  Even Michael Savage understands the potential ramifications of Jewish liberalism.  How come to rest are so darn dumb?<br>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t the liberal Democrats supposed to be the champions of civil rights, equality and anti-discrimination? On the surface it seems ironic that the four Democratic judges would rule against the white fire-fighters who were denied promotion because of their race, but knowing the Left operates on double-standards, particularly when civil rights pertain to whites, it&rsquo;s quite obvious that they have an anti-white racial agenda and aren&rsquo;t really representatives of equality and anti-discrimination.</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m pleased with the ruling. However; I find it troubling that 4 Supreme Court Justices can find the right in the Constitution to blatantly discriminate against white men.<br>
 The Obama Administration has shown that it has no problem with discriminating against whites by the various members of his cabinet and his selection for the new Supreme Court Justice,Sotomaier.<br>
 At some time we will arrive at a tipping point, the power arrayed against the white race will become so powerful that nothing wll be able to stand against it.</p>

		<p>Ginsberg is right, this ruling will not stand.  If anything happens to Kennedy, the swing vote on the Supreme Court, it will be overturned.  The Civil Rights act of 1964 needs to be overturned.  If we are to be a country where the right to free association is outlawed, at the very least there should be no grounds for an individual to have any recourse if they are &#8220;unintentionally&#8221; discriminated against.  And most of all the government, at all levels, should be required to treat all citizens equally and use the same standards for hiring and promotions.  This is not where we are headed, however.</p>

		<p>So they did this because they feared a lawsuit from minorities.  Why?  Because they figured a lawsuit from white guys would never see the light of day.  The same thing happened in Atlanta when they said the library system had &#8220;too many old white women running things&#8221;.  The result was a $12M loss for the city because the &#8220;old white women&#8221; who were demoted and moved to locations in rural hellholes just for being white, WON.</p>

		<p>Here is an interesting observation.  I read about the decision on the NY Times website.  Please, don&rsquo;t hold it against me!  My work blocks many sites, but the NY Times is permitted.  While I usually avoid it like the plague, I wanted to read about the decision.</p>
<p>Many people had posted comments, and, as expected, many were from wingbat liberals angry about it.  But the NY Times permits subscribers to &#8220;recommend&#8221; comments, and a reader can sort comments by most recommended.  When I did that, I was pleasantly surprised to find that almost all of the most recommended comments were in support of the decision.  Remember, these are people posting and responding to comments on the NY Times!  It just goes to show that there are lot more race realists out there than the MSM would like to admit.</p>

		<p>Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, that the city claimed their decision was based on the possibility they might get sued by the non-whites, yet it never seemed to concern them that whites would sue them and win, as they just did.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that the city thought it was taking the path of least resistance and the mayor is a self-hating white.</p>
<p>I wonder why non-white law suits concern this mayor more than white ones. That question was answered by him on the Lou Dobbs show tonight, when he said in a video clip that the Supreme Court wasn&rsquo;t in step with what he called, &#8220;civil rights.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Worse than the non-white gimmes are the white sychophants like this mayor and any of them elected to office by whites should be thrown out in the next election.</p>
<p>Ginsburg&rsquo;s claim that the decision won&rsquo;t have &#8220;staying power&#8221; is no less than her belief that unjust radical leftist thought will eventually prevail and dominate the court&rsquo;s decision in the future.  And she&rsquo;s probably right.</p>
<p>She also said, in effect, that scoring high on a test wasn&rsquo;t really that important.  Really bizarre considering the tests were job related ones that were crucial to getting the best qualified people to protect the city against fires.</p>
<p>When standards are set for promotion that involve promoting the most knowledgeable people and these people are denied promotions because of their race, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of racist totalitarianism within an empire that caters to its privileged group who is recognized as having more rights than anyone else.</p>
<p>This country is nothing but a cess pool of multiracialism that is replete with corruption and injustice, and it is good that it is near it&rsquo;s end right now.  </p>
<p>We reached the point of no return long ago, so no matter the outcome of the decision the country is still finished.  All we&rsquo;ve been doing the last 40 years is fighting a delaying action anyway.</p>
<p>This is Rome in the final days, only there won&rsquo;t be another city to relocate to in order to pretend the country still matters.  It will be broken up into racial, ethnic, and political enclaves, and the federal government will have no power.</p>

<p>One the one hand, luckily, there is no higher court it can be appealed to, but in spite of this, I think most people expect Sotomayor will get the job on the Supreme Court, then they will look at it again one day and it could go 5-4 the other way. Nothing is written in stone, it appears, except the ten commandments, and even they have been overruled by a higher authority: the ACLU.</p>

		<p>Ruth Ginsburg is a perfect example of how out of touch our &#8220;leaders&#8221; are to White working people. The best we can hope for is that no conservatives will retire from the Supreme Court while Obama is in office. As long as a liberal replaces a liberal, we won&rsquo;t lose any ground. We are one conservative judge retiring during Obamas term away from anarchy in this country. </p>

		<p>The courts are the wrong focus of concern.  Affirmative action, disparate impact rules, and the entire corpus of violations of one&rsquo;s natural right to freedom of association did not fall from the skys.  These laws were constructed by marxist White legislators.  It is their fault and the legislature must be the focus of all pressure.  Do not vote for anyone who does not pledge to overturn all laws interfering with freedom of association and to implement a constitutional amendment prohibiting the government from ever doing so again.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But they had no vested right to promotion.&#8221;<br>
really?<br>
the city needs upper level personnel, and advertises this need to the department, and gives a test date, along with standards that need to be met in order to be promoted. </p>
<p>Interested firefighters invest time and money to prepare for the test and take the test, a test that could potentially impact their future depending on how badly they did. </p>
<p>it sounds like they are vested to me, it almost sounds like they have a contract with the city, especially since the only reason given was that the city feared a lawsuit from those who failed the test.</p>
<p>Ginsberg&rsquo;s dissent gives away her solution to the issue, give the test as often as needed to in order to get the desired outcome. The truth is the 4 dissenters want quota&rsquo;s and to do away with testing altogether. Lucky us!</p>

		<p>What this decision actually did was make sure that everyone regardless of race will be treated fairly.The intent of the law was not to judge people based on their skin color but on their ability to perform.This was a great win praise God! If this decision doesn&rsquo;t have staying power it will be because of the future appointees to the Supreme Court and future challenges.The racist President and his gang of pro -color decision makers will attempt to rip all fairness from our laws and if they succeed it will only leave one option.Be prepared for that day and unite to fight for our right.</p>

		<p><i>But Ginsburg said the court should have assessed &#8220;the starkly disparate results&#8221; of the exams against the backdrop of historical and ongoing inequality in the New Haven fire department. As of 2003, she said, only one of the city&rsquo;s 21 fire captains was African-American. </i></p>
<p>Until this decision, Ginsburg said, the civil rights law&rsquo;s prohibitions on intentional discrimination and disparate impact were complementary, both aimed at ending workplace discrimination. </p>
<p>&#8220;Today&rsquo;s decision sets these paired directives at odds,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s my response to Ginsburg.  Any actual differences in human competence will invariably have &#8220;disparate impact&#8221;, regardless of whether those differences are due to genes, culture, or some combination of the two.  It is a fact that Jews are vastly overrepresented (based on their percentage of the population) in law, medicine, and academia.  Should we start firing Jews to bring about ethnically balanced workforces in those areas?  Should we toss out bar exams, PhD examinations, and med school exams and residency requirements because of their demonstrated disparate impact?  You can have a meritocracy or you can have equal representation of all races, religions, and sexes in every occupation, but you can&rsquo;t have both.  Which does Ginsberg want?</p>

		<p>I fear that, sadly, Ginsburg is right.  The decision certainly will not have staying power.  Not that this is a reason to vote against it.  The reason it will not have staying power is that victory is ultimately on the side of demographics.  The republicrats keep importing more and more &#8220;people of color&#8221; and whites refuse to have enough babies to replace themselves.  So, by right or by might, whites will lose.  Unless, by some miracle, the ignorant white masses wake up and see the writing on the wall. </p>
<p>This may be one of the last correct decisions the Supreme Court will ever make.  The Constitution is already irrelevant to them.  Soon, so will white people.</p>

		<p>Apparently the amicus brief submitted by the International Association of Professional Black Firefighters stated that it was &#8220;widely known and accepted that cognitive examinations, such as used here, have a demonstrated adverse impact on blacks and other minorities.&#8221;   And according to the Southerm Illinois Catholic blog,  &ldquo;The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has a  &lsquo;four-fifths rule,&rsquo; which holds that a job-related test in which the passing rate of a racial minority is less than 80% of the white rate is presumptively flawed.&rdquo;  The blog went on to say that &ldquo;An expert (competitor of designer of the test used in N.H.) repeats in this article that non-whites perform less well on standardized tests than whites do.&rdquo;<br>
In the course of this litigation the Intl Assoc of Profession Black Firefights stated that its constituents, blacks, have inferior cognitive skills as tested.  Which is further confirmed by the EEOC as well as a competitor to I/O Solutions, the test designer.  Is this official recognition of racial differences and inferiority?  <br>
As an aside, the EEOC&rsquo;s rule of 80% is a violation of good statistical practice.  If there is a small sample size, 80% means nothing.  With a large sample size, 80% could mean a biased test or it could mean a poorly prepared minorities.  <br>

		<p>Some may look at this ruling as a small victory or no victory at all.  I say,no matter how small, this was a victory for all white people today.  And I commend those 11 firefighters for going for the long haul and standing their ground.  Just goes to show how much a President&rsquo;s choice of a Justice can affect the entire country.  Let us all pray that the conservatives on the bench remain there for at least the next 8 years.  You know if anymore retire, Obama is going to stack the bench with left leaning, let&rsquo;s tear up the Constitution nominees.</p>
<p>Best wishes to those firefighters.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;It is a fact that Jews are vastly overrepresented (based on their percentage of the population) in law, medicine, and academia. Should we start firing Jews to bring about ethnically balanced workforces in those areas?&#8221;</p>
<p>This has already been done before. In the 1920&rsquo;s, at a few universities in the east, schools set a quota on the number of Jews who could attend. Some schools were literally filled with Jewish students. The irony being, taken completely out of context, these same policies are used as an excuse for affirmative action, and as another excuse to acknowledge white evil. </p>
<p>Asians are sometimes negatively affected by affirmative action. By using politically correct guidelines of the present, in 50 years there will still be affirmative action against whites, because after all, in 2009, evil whites were discriminating against Asians.  </p>

		<p>i believe there should be a panel formed from the legislative body to review decisions made by the supreme court. this always comes down to a 5-4 vote one way or another, and it is obvious that these are not thought out decisions, they are politics left and right. given the same question, and reading the same constitution this body of judges should most of the time be 9-0 on a decision. these leftists should be taken off of the court and prosecuted for crimes against the united states. they are not deciding anything, they are pushing their agenda thats all. ginsburg, breyer, souter,and stevens should be put on trial or disqualified from serving. this case should have never had to be judged on, this is outright anti-white hatred and four of our own supreme court judges are enemies of the united states. </p>

		<p>I watched two different TV programs last evening to see what each had to say about the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision on this case.  Of course on MSNBC the program&rsquo;s host was totally put out that the white firemen had won the case.  He was stuttering and frosthing at the mouth as he explained that it looked like the five jurists who found for the firemen had &#8220;legislated from the bench.&#8221; The same with Keith Oberman, he was really put out that these white men had the gall to win their lawsuit.  He also excused Judge Sotomayer in explaining how she was totally in the right by following precedent and that it wouldn&rsquo;t harm her in her quest to sit on the Supreme Court.  Only on the Lou Dobb&rsquo;s show did I see any kind of thoughtful, measured analysis of the decision.  Lou Dobbs had the attorney from New Haven on the show and it looks as though these white men are still far from receiving the promotions that they so well deserve.  Six years this has been going on, and the way this black attorney sounded, it may well be another six years before this case is settled by the lower court.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The answer, of course, is that the city thought it was taking the path of least resistance and the mayor is a self-hating white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ranger, there is another way of looking at this. The mayor is white but not self hating: he, like so many yuppie whites, sneers down at any kind of manual labor. To the mayor, who cares if blacks get the &#8220;worthless blue collar&#8221; firefighter jobs? To whites like this mayor, real white men work in cubicles or if they really have some personal worth, in upscale offices with a nice view of the river. See how that works? </p>
<p>The majority consensus of mainstream American whites favors a kind of caste system that dares not speak its name. The brown guy mows the lawn, the black guy fights fires, and the white guy looks down at it all from his posh office window in his Brooks Brothers suit. Whites who work manual labor, even whites who walk with a little swagger or have some hint uncouth manliness are the real dinosaurs in the mayor&rsquo;s yuppie world view. Those are the &#8220;white trash&#8221; who might as well be replaced by black and brown laborers and toughs, to the mayor. </p>
<p>Whites who think like this are unshakable in their view, by the way. To them, white = wimpyish corporate cubicle dweller who never gets his hands dirty, by definition and proud of it! </p>

		<p>Interesting to note that when you read the dissenting opinion by Ginsberg nothing is mentioned about what specific questions in the test were biased and would give a white person who takes the exam an advantage. She is basing her entire argument on the results of the test as if racial bias is the ONLY possible reason the minorities did not score as well as the whites who took the test. All we get is smoke and mirrors and a history lesson on discrimination from her in her opinion, nothing about what was in fact biased within the test. Can she really think past wrongs should be rectified by taking it out on these 20 white fire fighters and discriminating against them in this way? Shame on her and  the other dissenters for being in favor of racial discrimination. That practice is wrong all the time, not just when it is against blacks and Hispanics.</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m happy for Frank Ricci and the other white firefighters, the ruling didn&rsquo;t go far enough to eliminate the discrimatory &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; rule that was established by the Griggs vs. Duke decision. I think many of the precedent- following/constitutional judges realized that fact. Certainly, Justice Scalia (the best judicial mind) said as much in his opinion. Unfortunately, with ultra-liberal Justices like Ruth Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens, David Souter and soon that &#8220;Wise Latina&#8221; Sotomajor, I don&rsquo;t see any big reversal of the race based hiring and promotion widely practiced by our government and most corporations. In fact, trust our president to appoint ideological clones of the neo-Marxist witch Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  </p>

This recent case will not solve the problem, because every time one of these tests shows blacks and hispanics lagging, the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; clause will kick in.

		<p>&#8220;The freedom you possess is the freedom that you TAKE&#8221;.  I have been discriminating against certain &#8220;ethnic groups&#8221; for YEARS.  The &#8220;public accommodation&#8221; laws that have been put in place can be circumvented.  Of course, this works best in a service business (by appointment) where there are no &#8220;walk in&#8221; customers.  With names like &#8220;shanika&#8221; and &#8220;latoya&#8221; it is easy to be &#8220;selective&#8221;.  <br>
Another thing drives the &#8220;fair housing&#8221; proponents mad.  The testers that check for &#8220;housing discrimination&#8221; use one white &#8220;tester&#8221; and one black &#8220;tester&#8221; (which is required by law).  By telephone, with almost 100% accuracy, it is possible to tell whether a person is white or black by the inflections in speech.  This is one thing that blacks cannot get away from (no matter how intelligent or &#8220;educated&#8221; they are.<br>
It is time for whites to simply IGNORE the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws since &#8220;attorney general&#8221; eric holder said that they do not apply to whites.  TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY.</p>

		<p>In response to some of the comments here, especially the one made by GetBackJack, I don&rsquo;t see how this is a Jewish thing.  Yes, Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the dissenting opinion, but two of the other three justices she was writing for where Christian.

You have to wonder at the amount of self-deception so prevalent amongst liberals. Personally I think it is the legacy of the institutionalized irrationality of Marxism. That serpent just won&rsquo;t die. As I have said before the appeal of Marxism is mythical; it corresponds to the hope that entropy can be defeated. I call it the myth of the Phoenix: from an event of great anti-national disorder - the great revolutionary fire -  a nation will emerge from the ashes cleansed and more powerful than ever. But in reality, when breakdown happens, things stay broken. Abandonment is the only option left.<br>
All of the formerly revolutionary nations have had to painfully reassess their politics. All of those who kept to the utopian pretence eventually collapse. Odd how the philosophy which promised the historical certainty of plenty if enacted proves to be the one constant in all states which are ruined.</p>

		<p>Anybody with any common sense whatsoever fully knows that the Supreme Court decision in favor of the Firefighters was the correct way to go. Only those that are total &#8220;racists&#8221; themselves have a problem with that decision. And  Sonya Sotomayor is one of those along with the rest of the fools that voted against the Firefighters in New Haven.  <br>
    Racism is racism! and discrimination is discrimination! and that&rsquo;s all there is to it! To deny these Firefighters a promotion when they worked hard and busted their stones studying and being top notch both in studying and on the job simply because of the color of their skin is slap in the face racism in it&rsquo;s most horrendous form and those that are responsible should pay the price.<br>
    We have laws against discrimination on the books and the city of New Haven and Judge Sotomayor broke those laws and should be duly punished for it.  Oh yes! I forgot there is some &#8220;desperate impact&#8221; clause in the law somewhere which states that those of color that are too stupid or too lazy to qualify for a job they SHOULD GET IT ANYWAY because they are desperate.  He! He! that&rsquo;s a regular riot!<br>
   I have no problem with anybody getting a job that is best qualified for that job be they white, black, brown, or purple with pink flowers. It&rsquo;s the hiring of people that           </p>

Our local angry black male talk show host touched on this topic today. He said, just as I said on a previous post, that blacks could no longer depend on <b>doing poorly</b> on tests as a means to get promotions. He also said that he talking to black firefighters and that too many of them said their main concern was sticking it out and getting their pension. So much for duty and commitment to being the best. It&rsquo;s all about coasting to retirement and waiting for the payoff.</p>

		<p>Getting over on test results reminds me of posting grades as a professor. My experience is that non-whites   &mdash;   not just low-performing blacks and hispanics, but even Asians, who are generally good students   &mdash;   are far more likely to blame me for their results. Are there whites who try to cheat, whine, seduce, bribe, threaten or stoop to any depth to get around what they themselves have wrought? Sure, they exist. Are there non-whites who let their work do their talking, rugged individuals who lie in the beds they made, who take it like a man (or woman), who don&rsquo;t act owed or like I shot their mother just because they didn&rsquo;t earn an &#8220;A+&#8221;? Sure, they exist too. In my humble opinion, however, whites – especially, for good reasons, young white men – more than others, expect no free ride. As Western civilization fades, concepts of individual thought, effort and merit die with it.</p>
<p>Becoming a teacher and professor raised my racial awareness. Be glad we&rsquo;re alive now and not a generation from now. I often wonder what truth, what reality right in front of their faces, will pierce the doublethink of self-loathing, politically correct whites. Maybe the Obama years will answer that.<br>

		<p>It is outrageous that the Supreme Court was not unanimous. The issue is whether or not an employer can throw out or fail to use (as promised explicitly or implicitly) the results of a reasonable subject matter test because not enough of a racial group passed or because the employer was afraid of lawsuit. Clearly it is racial discrimination against the passers (and irrational &amp; counter productive) to do so.</p>
<p>The judgments of four liberal judges and the suit threats of the black &#8220;firefighters&#8221; are shameful. </p>
<p>The implications for affirmative action in university admissions testing is clear enough. To throw out the better results of some whites to accommodate lower testing blacks is also racial discrimination.</p>
<p>Of course, one problem is that low life creators of tests will always be around to design tests that deliberately sacrifice rigorous standards to get more blacks to pass. These shameful travesties of testing will be praised by low life spineless administrators and liberal pin heads as hallmarks of diversity excellence. </p>

<p>At root, the problem rests with disparate-impact law itself. </p>
<p>I can predict that rational employers will react to Ricci by dropping such exams whenever possible, in effect capitulating to the racial bean-counters. Such an outcome is disconcerting, at least for those who believe that firefighter supervisors should have some requisite body of knowledge before sending public servants into burning buildings.</p>
<p>To head off this undesirable result, Congress should undo its 1991 decision to codify the disparate-impact test into the Civil Rights Act. &#8221; </p>
