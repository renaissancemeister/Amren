<h1>Shootout Kills 16 in Mexico&rsquo;s Acapulco Resort</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Natalia Parra, AP, June 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexican soldiers fought a two-hour battle with heavily armed men holed up at a house in an Acapulco hotel zone, killing 15 of the gunmen as Mexican tourist cowered in their rooms nearby.</p>
<p>One soldier was killed and the wounded included three soldiers and three bystanders. Several Mexican tourists were evacuated from small hotels in a faded neighborhood once frequented by Hollywood stars.</p>
<p>When soldiers arrived at the house on a tip, the gunmen opened fire and hurled some 50 grenades, according to an Army colonel, who wore a ski mask to protect his identity as he led reporters on a tour of the scene Sunday. He spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons.</p>
<p>Several gunmen tried to flee, but crashed their car into a military Hummer that was blocking the gate. At one point, more armed men with grenades arrived by car to reinforce the gunmen in the house, but they died in the shooting, the colonel said.</p>
<p>Soldiers found four Guerrero state police officers handcuffed inside the garage of the house, the colonel said. The officers, who were still bound and sitting the floor when reporters arrived, said they&rsquo;d been held captive by the gunmen, the colonel said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The gunbattle raged just blocks from a residence owned decades ago by the late &#8220;Tarzan&#8221; actor Johnny Weissmuller, and about 100 meters (yards) from Hotel Los Flamingos, owned in the 1950s by John Wayne. The hotel is still popular with older American tourists.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the gunmen belonged to one of drug cartels that have been fighting for turf in Guerrero state, home to Acapulco and the resort town of Zihuatanejo, the colonel said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Felipe Calderon has deployed more than 45,000 soldiers across Mexico to battle drug violence. More than 10,800 people have died since the offensive began in December 2006.<br>

		<p>And it was just the other night that Geraldo Rivera said it was nonsense to forego a vacation to Mexico, because the resort cities are all crime free, completely untouched by drug violence.</p>
<p>That man is the biggest bigot favoring mestizos all over the earth and lying for them just so he can try to fool everybody into believing they are peace-loving religious angels, wanting only to work and pray.</p>
<p>Why Fox continues to have such a blatant liar on their network is totally beyond me.  He&rsquo;s hated by most on the right.</p>

		<p>This is a good start but much more must be done.  The Mexican drug trader is a terrorist and thief.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad this happened in Acapulco. Now, the Mexican federales can no longer claim that crime doesn&rsquo;t exist in resort places like Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta, or Cancun. It&rsquo;s probably rampant in the latter two cities.</p>
<p>Some of you Amrenners may know the story of an American newlywed couple who were attacked and killed in their Acapulco hotel, a few years ago. They were then tossed off the balcony by Mexican bandits. The Mexican government actually claimed that the couple took a mutual lover&rsquo;s &#8220;suicide leap&#8221;, despite the evidence.</p>
<p>Why go to Mexico just to loll around on a stinking Mexican beach? Heck, you can go to a beach in California, Florida, or even Acadia National Park in Maine. Besides, the water tastes better - you won&rsquo;t get dysentery.</p>

		<p>When will the world learn that Mexico is on a par with any corrupt country in the Middle East? The murders, kidnappings, beheadings, are the same there as the countries we are at war with. Yet, this administration and the rest of the pro-illgal cheerleaders go merrily along ignoring this fact. We take their people in, heap benefits on them from birth to death, including citizenship. We send money anytime they ask, their people remit enough to support most of the country and then our President steps up and apologizes for our part of the drug wars that have taken thousands of lives in that violent nation. Mexico has never been self-sustaining and continually blames someone else - mostly us - for their ills. The mindset of the country and its people is a criminal one, and that&rsquo;s what they bring with them when they invade and colonize our nation. So, I guess we really ARE to blame for the stupidity of electing those who would seek to remake us in the image of our neighbor to the south.</p>

That statement is 100% true. Mexico is also a petro-state like most of the middle eastern countries. Only Mexico&rsquo;s oil is running out very fast. Optimistic projections show Mexico becoming a net oil importer in the next 5 years. The Mexican state is losing primary source of revenue at the same time drug cartels have their own armed forces. The situation south of the border is only going to get worse.</p>
