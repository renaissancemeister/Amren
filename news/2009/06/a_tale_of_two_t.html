			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Francis Beckwith, What&rsquo;s Wrong With the World, May 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Consider two cases about two tests. The first, <cite>Bartlett v. the New York State Board of Law Examiners,</cite> is from 1997. The other, <cite>Ricci v. DeStefano,</cite> is presently on appeal before the U. S. Supreme Court, which will issue its opinion sometime soon. In the first case, the jurist who issued the ruling was Judge Sonia Sotomayor when she served on the bench of the Federal District Court of the Southern District of New York. In the latter case, the Supreme Court will be assessing a Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in which Judge Sonia Sotomayor participated.</p>
<p>What follows is a summary of the first case, found in the article authored by Ruth Shalit, &#8220;Defining Disability Down,&#8221; published in the August 25, 1997 issue of <cite>The New Republic:</cite.<blockquote>Consider the lawsuit filed in 1993 by an aspiring attorney named Marilyn J. Bartlett. Bartlett graduated in 1991 from Vermont Law School, where she received generous accommodations for her reading disability and a disability in &#8220;phonological processing.&#8221; Nonetheless, Bartlett did not do well, graduating with a GPA of 2.32 and a class standing of 143 out of 153 students. She then went to work as a professor of education at Dowling College, where, according to court documents, she &#8220;receives accommodations at work for her reading problems in the form of a full-time work-study student who assists her in reading and writing tasks.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it came time to take the bar exam, Bartlett petitioned the New York Board of Law Examiners for special arrangements. She wanted unlimited time for the test, access to food and drink, a private room and the use of an amanuensis to record her answers. Acting on the advice of its own expert, who reported that Bartlett&rsquo;s test data did not support a diagnosis of a reading disorder, the board refused Bartlett&rsquo;s demands. Three times, Bartlett attempted the exam without accommodation. After her third failure, she sued the board.</p>
<p>On July 3, 1997, Judge Sonia Sotomayor ruled in Bartlett&rsquo;s favor. {snip} Judge Sotomayor did not challenge the board&rsquo;s contention that Bartlett was neither impaired nor disabled, at least not in the traditional sense. In an enterprising new twist, however, she declared that Bartlett&rsquo;s skills ought not to be compared to those of an &#8220;average person in the general population&#8221; but, rather, to an &#8220;average person with comparable training, skills and abilities&#8221;  &mdash;  i.e., to her fellow cohort of aspiring lawyers.</p>
<p>An &#8220;essential question&#8221; in the case, said the judge, was whether the plaintiff would &#8220;have a substantial impairment in performing [the] job&#8221; of a practicing lawyer. The answer to this question was &#8220;yes,&#8221; the judge found. And this answer  &mdash;  the fact that Bartlett would have a very hard time meeting the job requirements of a practicing lawyer  &mdash;  was, in the judge&rsquo;s opinion, precisely the reason why Bartlett had a protected right to become a practicing lawyer. {snip}</p>
<p>To drive home her point, Judge Sotomayor triumphantly cited Bartlett&rsquo;s performance during a courtroom demonstration of her reading skills. &#8220;Plaintiff read haltingly and laboriously, whispering and sounding out some words more than once under her breath before she spoke them aloud,&#8221; the judge recalled. &#8220;She made one word identification error, reading the word &#8216;indicted&rsquo; as &#8216;indicated.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>It could, of course, be argued that the ability to read is an essential function of lawyering; that any law school graduate who cannot distinguish &#8220;indicated&#8221; from &#8220;indicted,&#8221; who cannot perform cognitive tasks under time constraints, is incapable of performing the functions of a practicing lawyer and therefore, perhaps, should not be a practicing lawyer. But one would be arguing those things in the teeth of the law. Thanks to the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Individuals With Disabilities in Education Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Bartlett and her fellows among the learning-disabled are now eligible for a lifelong buffet of perks, special breaks and procedural protections, a web of entitlement that extends from cradle to grave.<br>
</blockquote></p>
<p>Now, consider another test and another plaintiff of more recent vintage. It is the case of <cite>Ricci v. DeStefano.</cite> What follows is Stuart Taylor&rsquo;s summary of the case, published in December 2008 in <cite>National Journal Magazine.</cite><blockquote>Frank Ricci, a firefighter in New Haven, Conn., worked hard, played by the rules, and earned a promotion to fire lieutenant. But the city denied him the promotion because he is not black. Ricci sued, along with 16 other whites and one Hispanic firefighter. After a 7-6, near-party-line vote by a federal Appeals Court to dismiss the lawsuit, the plaintiffs petitioned for Supreme Court review.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Ricci and other would-be lieutenants and captains with high scores did not get the promotions they expected. The reason was that  &mdash;  because not enough black firefighters had done well enough to be eligible  &mdash;  New Haven decided to discard the test results and make no promotions at all.</p>
<p>In their lawsuit, Ricci and his fellow plaintiffs claimed that the city, Mayor John DeStefano, and other defendants had violated their rights under the Constitution&rsquo;s equal protection clause and under federal civil-rights laws.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Janet Arterton of New Haven dismissed the case. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit affirmed the dismissal, {snip}.</p>
<p>Arterton was appointed by President Clinton. So were the three 2nd Circuit judges who heard the initial appeal, including Sonia Sotomayor, who is touted by liberal and Hispanic groups as a leading candidate for an Obama appointment to the Supreme Court. The three-judge panel initially deep-sixed the firefighters&rsquo; appeal in a cursory, unpublished order that disclosed virtually nothing about the nature of the ideologically explosive case.</p>
<p>Then the Circuit&rsquo;s more conservative judges got wind of the case. They sought to have it reheard by the full Appeals Court but lost in a 7-6 vote. {snip}</p>
<p>Writing for the six dissenters, Cabranes [Jose Carbranes, a Clinton appointee] said that the majority &#8220;failed to grapple with the questions of exceptional importance raised in this appeal,&#8221; and he urged the Supreme Court to do so. He also raised the question of whether the case involved &#8220;an unconstitutional racial quota or set-aside.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cabranes stressed that despite the importance of the issues and the unusually long and detailed briefs, arguments, and factual record, the three-judge panel&rsquo;s &#8220;perfunctory disposition&#8221; oddly contained &#8220;no reference whatsoever to the constitutional claims at the core of this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five of the majority judges, including Sotomayor, retorted that New Haven&rsquo;s decision to discard the test results and deny what would otherwise have been virtually automatic promotions to the highest-scoring white and Hispanic firefighters was &#8220;facially race-neutral.&#8221; The reason? Because none of the low-scoring, ineligible African-American firefighters was promoted either. These five judges also endorsed Judge Arterton&rsquo;s conclusion that the city&rsquo;s decision was justified by fears that promoting the high-scoring whites might violate Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and bring a discrimination suit by the low-scoring blacks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Racial politics clearly did figure in the city&rsquo;s denial of promotions to the white and Hispanic firefighters. Politically powerful African-American leaders made it clear that if not enough blacks were eligible for promotion, then no whites should be promoted either. {snip}<br>
</blockquote>Four questions:</p>
<p>If you were the New Haven fire department, would you hire Ms. Bartlett to represent you in a suit filed against you by Mr. Ricci?</p>
<p>If you were Ms. Bartlett and lived in New Haven and you were trapped in your burning home, would you find more comfort in Mr. Ricci arriving at your home or one of the other firefighters whose performance was not as good as his?</p>
<p>Are these two opinions consistent with each other?</p>
<p>And if so, what legal theory would best account for their consistency?<br>

Everyone is given the same lessons with the same teachers in the same classrooms with the same time constraints using the same coarse materials and the same opportunities to study (or not) on their own.</p>
<p>Question: Where is the discrimination?</p>
<p>As I understand it, the New Haven test is under seal. That means we can not review the test to see which questions, if any, are racially biased.</p>
<p>The reason the test is sealed is because there is no racial bias in the test and making the test public would should show the test as race neutral.</p>
<p>None of this matter in an age of universal deceit.</p>
<p>The nomination of Judge Sotomayor will only accelerate the racial spoils system of each group fighting over the carcass of a dying America.</p>
<p>In the near future, the blind will sue to be hired as driving instructors and they will win that &#8216;right&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Welcome the death of reason and logic. Welcome the death of America.<br>

		<p>Taking this logic to its full extent, it won&rsquo;t be long until racial differences in IQ are classified as &#8220;disabilities&#8221; for those who have low IQ, and they&rsquo;ll get extra testing time, more tutoring, and so on.  Or, Harrison Bergeron like, they&rsquo;ll make life harder for smart students.</p>

		<p>I think the accomodations for people who are supposedly &#8220;learning disabled&#8221; have gone way too far. In my opinion, if someone is truly &#8220;learning disabled&#8221; they should not be in a university, let alone a law school. If they cannot do the work as assigned then they need to find job training that they can succeed in. </p>

		<p>Fire does not respect diversity, multiculturalism, or affirmative action.  When a fire&rsquo;s raging, it takes knowledge, skill, strength, and stamina to contain it and put it out. A firefighter has to have that knowledge, skill, strength, and stamina.  Otherwise, the fire will continue to burn   &mdash;   simple and as basic as that is.  </p>
<p>The tests were originally designed to be objective indicators of what is required to fight a fire and win.  When the tests are downgraded to enable the less-skilled to dress up as firefighters, guess what?  The fire don&rsquo;t care!</p>
<p>Lives and property are at stake when a fire&rsquo;s burning down a building. A sane society would want skilled firefighters who know what to do and who can handle the physical workload.  America ceased being a sane society many years ago, though.</p>
<p>Likewise, there are some people who are not cut out to be lawyers, even though the physical strength and stamina requirements are considerably less than that needed for firefighters.  An ability to read and write would seem to be a basic given, but after that unfortunate ruling, perhaps illiterates can now be lawyers.  Would I hire one?  Well, in the olden days of sane America, a man who served as his own lawyer would be deemed a fool.  In today&rsquo;s America, if Ms. Bartlett were assigned as a public defender for me, I&rsquo;d fire her if I could and would serve as my own counsel. Few would brand me a fool for doing so, either.</p>

		<p>It is not the job of the appellate judge to throw out stupid laws.  They verify that the law is constitutional and applied correctly.  In the case of ambiguities, such as those that can exist between the 14th amendment and accepted silly laws like affirmative action, they can weigh the situations and come up with interstitial law, which can, and should be cleared up by the legislature.</p>
<p>It is stupid White Marxist legislators that demolished any semblance of a right to freedom of association in our society.  Non-marxist Whites must vote as a block, and in their best interests, and remove all incumbent congressmen.</p>

		<p>&#8220;the highest-scoring white and Hispanic firefighters&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought Hispanics were considered a minority. In Ricci v. DeStefano she ruled against a minority and one of her own race as well. No wonder Obama wants her as a judge. All she really cares about is if the person is Black. No other minority need apply.</p>

		<p>In response to question diversity: </p>
<p>All of the extra everything that is used to try to make up for the IQ disparity (because that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re really trying to make up for) has come to naught. Even if the powers that be recognize what the problem is, the solutions will be largely unchanged, and therefore doomed to failure. The natural response will be to make a dystopian nightmare for our best and brightest. I see the seeds of it being sown in high schools and colleges. When it finally happens, America will  be lost for good. Might as well pack your stuff and move on out. </p>

		<p>the example of the disabled person who couldn&rsquo;t read is ridiculous. you can&rsquo;t read? don&rsquo;t be a lawyer. a blind person might have a case. but this basketcase illiterate? besides, only the government would hire such an incompetent as an attorney. classic case of if you want it, you can have it theory of liberalism.</p>
<p>As for Ricci, it&rsquo;s tragic that good qualified firefighters can&rsquo;t run the department because of PC liberal automatons who give credence to the traitorous EEOC and its guidelines which in reality are statutes passed by liberal bureaucrats and not Congress.  Judge Sonia is no working class judge; she lives in Greenwich Village and dumps on hardworking white workers. Her loyalty to America is about as strong as Barack Hussein Obama&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I would say that a written test may be unnecessary,but that is how the New Haven department chose to go along with oral interviews.  Ignorant and illiterate blacks can&rsquo;t pass written tests so many cities other than New Haven are stuck with &#8220;acting&#8221; department heads in fire fighting. </p>

		<p>First, Southern Hoosier, I think Ricci is italian.  DeStefano certainly IS, and I can&rsquo;t for the life of me figure out why the italians in that city haven&rsquo;t ridden the traitor out of town tarred and feathered and riding a rail!  Last I knew, the New Haven area had a large italian population and they are known for being hard-working with a good work ethic.  Maybe DeStefano has &#8220;connectiions&#8221;,. but he seems gay to me, I could never figure out why they re-elected him either. Watching him on a news report always made my skin crawl.  </p>
<p>I know a man from Bridgeport, CT. and when the fire departments were forced to hire blacks, the morale went down terribly because the blacks weren&rsquo;t trusted to be counted on when things got hot.   I have a solution, not a pc one, but one I think we would all like.  Put only black firefighters in the firehouses in the black neighborhoods and let the cinders fall where they may.</p>

I worked in State vocational rehabiliation for 4 years and administered IQ and achievement tests to people who had been identified as &#8220;learning disabled&#8221; and mentally retarded. Vocational counselors used my recommendations based on the testing to determine what type of training (university level, trade school, or unskilled work)that would pay for. The important factor is that VC&rsquo;s bonuses were based on successful completion of the training and subsequent successful employment based on that training. So do you think the VC&rsquo;s used my recommendations? Heck yes, they did! Even the black VC&rsquo;s followed the recommendations however it is not common knowledge that IQ is inherited, so there was no controversy. If they had a black MR kid come in and say he wanted to be a lawyer, they would say, &#8220;You can try college if you want to, but I&rsquo;m not going to pay for it.&#8221;</p>
