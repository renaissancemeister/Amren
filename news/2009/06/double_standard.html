<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WHEN a right- wing Christian vigilante kills, millions of fingers pull the trigger. When a left-wing Muslim vigilante kills, he kills alone.</p>
<p>This is the narrative in the Sunday shooting death of late-term abortion provider George Tiller of Kansas and the Monday shootings of two Arkansas military recruiters.</p>
<p>Tiller&rsquo;s suspected murderer, Scott Roeder, is white, Christian, anti-government and anti-abortion. The alleged gunman in the military recruitment center attack, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, is black, a Muslim convert, anti-military and anti-American.</p>
<p>Both crimes are despicable acts of domestic terrorism. The disparate treatment of the two brutal cases by both the White House and the media is striking.</p>
<p>President Obama issued a statement condemning &#8220;heinous acts of violence&#8221; within hours of Tiller&rsquo;s death. The Justice Department issued its own statement and sent federal marshals to protect abortion clinics. News anchors and headline writers abandoned all qualms about labeling the gunman a terrorist.</p>
<p>An almost gleeful excess of mainstream commentary poured forth on the climate of hate and fear created by conservative talk radio, blogs and Fox News in reporting Tiller&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<p>By contrast, Obama was silent about the attacks that left 24-year-old Pvt. William Long dead and 18-year-old Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula gravely wounded.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Obama said nothing. The Justice Department was mum. So were the legions of finger-pointing pundits happily convicting the pro-life movement and every right-leaning writer of contributing to the murder of Tiller. {snip}</p>
<p>Why the silence? Politically and religiously motivated violence, it seems, is only worth lamenting when it demonizes opponents. Which also helps explain why the phrase &#8220;lone shooter&#8221; is ubiquitous in media coverage of jihadi shooters gone wild  &mdash;  think convicted &#8220;Jeep Jihadist&#8221; Mohammed Taheri-Azar at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill or Israel-bashing gunman Naveed Haq, who targeted a Seattle Jewish charity, or Los Angeles International Airport shooter Hesham Hedayet, who opened fire at the El Al Israeli airline ticket counter  &mdash;  but not in cases involving rare acts of anti-abortion violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Just to clear the air, and to get the question out of the way, I don&rsquo;t approve of what the Tiller murderer did.  It appears it was out of vengeance, and vengeance is not our personal possession.  That said, I&rsquo;m not exactly bawling my eyes out for the victim.  There&rsquo;s this thing called Karma.  On top of that, I&rsquo;m not about to close the book on motive yet, this came just a few weeks after showing more people in polls are pro-life than pro-aborticide for the first time in a very long time, it could be that the suspect is a left wing provocateur or change agent, to try and flip public sympathies.  Except that Tiller specialized in the worst kind of the &#8220;procedure,&#8221; involving drilling holes into skulls.</p>
<p>Aboriticide isn&rsquo;t going away because it&rsquo;s the holy sacrament of gender equality.  It&rsquo;s the only way to allay the most obvious and plain differences between the genders.</p>
<p>When minorities or the left do it, they&rsquo;re not just cited as &#8220;lone killers,&#8221; but also as isolated incidents.</p>

		<p>The national reporting on these two murders is entirely rational and totally explicable.</p>
<p>Blacks only commit crimes because of racist oppression (I mean, everybody knows that).</p>
<p>Whites only commit crimes of violence because of racist or religious obsessions (I mean, everybody knows that).</p>

<p>Frankly, I would not put it past the Comrade BO crowd in DC and their adoring media lickspittles, to try and Reichstag Fire this thing. By that I mean, try and utterly obliterate every normal and decent human being on the planet, as an act of political &ldquo;cleansing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comrade Tiller was an animal, a serial baby butcher with an MD; yet he is now a &ldquo;martyr,&rdquo; in the eyes of these Red swine!</p>

		<p>  While the Washington Snipers were being identified as caucasians in a white truck, the media was on the story 24-7. Only when they discovered that the killers were a black, muslim and gay did they totally lose interest. When there was no longer any doubt of the innocence of the Duke Lacrosse team, the New York Times ran a front page story trying to confirm the athletes&rsquo; guilt. Fact is, the mainstream media, academe and our government is anti-white. Why should caucasians continue to support and fund institutions, private or public, that denigrate, ridicule and discriminate against them?</p>

Speaking cynically: why not?  Martyrs are a fantastic way to instill guilt in the minds of the Great Unwashed, even if the martyr in question was noticeably less than sympathetic.  It&rsquo;s just &#8220;uncivilized&#8221; to say you&rsquo;re not going to shed any tears over the victim.</p>

<p>Well, in the case of the government, they really have no choice.  If you don&rsquo;t pay your taxes, eventually you go to prison and to the poor house.</p>
<p>In the case of private institutions: what else is there?  What matriculated schools teach (White) racial preservation as part of their curricula?  Have you also tried to tell your average White out there to stop plugging into the mainstream media?  Good luck!  The Internet is really all we have left.</p>

Everyone, and I do mean everyone, knows that blacks are more likely to commit violent crimes.</p>
<p>One reason they focus on whites is try to knock whites off their &#8216;superiority&rsquo; position. Essentially it&rsquo;s, &#8216;see, the white man is just as violent and dangerous as they claim the black man is&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The left-wing news media seems to imply that the killing of Dr. Tiller is an indictment of the anti-abortion movement in general. But is it? Let us remember that John Brown and his Free State Volunteers slaughtered five pro-slavery men in Pottawatomie, Kansas in 1856. John Brown killed to further the end of slavery, while Scott Roeder killed to further the end of abortion. If killing to end abortion automatically indicts all anti-abortionists, then killing to end slavery must also automatically indict all anti-slavery men. Either the left approves of slavery or their logic is flawed. Unfortunately, liberals are unable to realize the stupidity of their own pseudo-reasoning because of their PC, double-think brain-washing. <br/>
Since the left constantly reassures us that Islam is a &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;, the left-wing news was bound to portray the murderous act of Abdulhakim Mohammed as a mere anomaly. </p>

<p>For two reasons:</p>
<p>1. Most whites are unaware of this.</p>
<p>2. Even if they were aware of this, most whites are filled with guilt, shame, self-loathing that even the slightest vocalization of anything pro-white will get them put back in their place real quickly.</p>

		<p>It is not a double standard. It is actually a single standard. A murder by a supposed &#8220;white christian vigilante&#8221; is played up. A murder by a black muslim is either not covered or mentioned as little as possible. This is the single standard employed in the MSM and the political class.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t get past the contradiction of the man, and Abortionist, Dr. Tiller. </p>
<p>This &#8220;Doctor&#8221; performed thousands of late-term abortions, yet he was an Usher at the Lutheran Church. Am I missing something here? </p>
<p>Why was this man allowed to work for the Church as an Usher, or in any other capacity? I know we are instructed to &#8220;Hate the Sin, Not the Sinner&#8221;, yet, are we supposed to elevate the Sinner to a prominant status among us, in our Houses of Worship? </p>
<p>This man did not simply take an item that didn&rsquo;t belong to him, or failed to miss Church on a Sunday, which both are sins according to GOD&rsquo;s Ten Commandments. No, this man took innocent lives, at the very moment they were to experience their own existance, in the arms of their Mothers. </p>
<p>Abortion is one of the gravest sins, for it denies the right of GOD&rsquo;s perfect creation to come to fruition. </p>
<p>As a Doctor, Dr. Tiller failed to keep the Hippocratic Oath, which Hippocratese directed to, &#8220;First, do no harm&#8221;. <br/>

		<p>There is no doubt that the MSM is anti-White.  What they&rsquo;re doing is painfully obvious.  The Black DC sniper and his Black accomplice andCho-the Oriental who killed 33 in Virginia are two examples of the media dropping cases of non-White crime as quickly as possible.  These crimes were dropped by the MSM very quickly and they are as heinous as you can get.  What do we hear about?  Some extremely isolated incidents of White violence with the media lambasting the White relentlessly.</p>

<p>Being as I was baptized Lutheran (MO Synod), I sorta know the time of day when it comes to Lutherans.  I wouldn&rsquo;t call the MO Synod right wing, but it&rsquo;s slightly less nauseating than the Minneapolis-based Evangelical Lutheran Council of America (ELCA), which, true to its Minnesota and Scandinavian roots, is liberal all the way.</p>
<p>The pertinent question about Dr. Driller is this:  The church can be forgiven, after all, all have sinned.  But what is the attraction that Dr. Driller have for this church?  He certainly didn&rsquo;t pick a Southern Baptist congregation.</p>
