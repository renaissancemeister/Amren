<h1>Another &#8216;Black Man Did It&rsquo; Hoax Sparks Outrage</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, AP, June 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s an old lie, claiming that The Black Man Did It.</p>
<p>But it was trotted out again last week when a white mother from suburban Philadelphia said two black men snatched her and her 9-year-old daughter from their SUV and abducted them in the trunk of a black Cadillac.</p>
<p>Blacks across the country were outraged after Bonnie Sweeten was found in a luxury hotel at Disney World. Authorities quickly unraveled the hoax, but not before an Amber Alert, frantic searches and national news coverage that played into images of marauding black men.</p>
<p>Racial boundaries are slowly dissolving in America, with President Barack Obama the most obvious example. Yet Sweeten&rsquo;s story, plus the killing of a black New York City cop by a white officer days later, was a reminder that old ideas remain burned into many minds both black and white.</p>
<p>Sweeten&rsquo;s story has provoked an outpouring of discussion among blacks, everywhere from doctor&rsquo;s offices to blogs. Syndicated radio host Warren Ballentine said his listeners are &#8220;furious, and they&rsquo;re disgusted.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On a scale of one to 10, it&rsquo;s a 15.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their hope was that by Obama becoming president, the rest of America would take a look at black Americans and look at us for who we are and not what a stereotype is,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Black Man Did It lie last made news as recently as October, when a John McCain volunteer claimed a 6-foot-4 black man carved a B into her cheek (For Barack, evidently). Charles Stuart told it in 1989 after he killed his wife in Boston. Susan Smith told it when she drowned her sons in 1994 in South Carolina. Unknown numbers of black men were hanged for it back when lynching was a common practice.</p>
<p>And those are the ones we heard about. Law professor Katheryn Russell-Brown documents 67 racial hoaxes in the period between 1987 and 1996 in her book &#8220;The Color of Crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seymour&rsquo;s blood starts to boil whenever people lock their car doors as he walks by  &mdash;  yet even blacks sometimes hit that button when black men are in the vicinity. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not just white people who act that way,&#8221; Seymour said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One easy explanation is that black men are convicted of crimes at much higher rates than any other group. So was falling for Sweeten&rsquo;s lie racism, or common sense? And does Sweeten&rsquo;s blond hair have anything to do with the amount of media coverage her story received?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a news conference after the hoax was exposed, Bucks County District Attorney Michelle Henry explained the charge of filing a false police report.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a terrifying thing,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for a community to hear that two black men in a black Cadillac grabbed a woman and her daughter.&#8221;<br>

		<p>When I worked in Washington DC for many years and drove home at night through some truly awful neighborhoods before I reached the relative security of Maryland(some of which is not so secure either any more thanks to &#8220;integration&#8221;), I always hit the lock buttons, didn&rsquo;t stop for black bums panhandling at traffic lights, and went thru red lights if necessary if crowds of black &#8220;youth&#8221; massed on street corners. When I read the paper in the morning, the body count in DC and nearby black Maryland suburbs grew year to year. The body count was mostly black, except if there was a poor white soul who got lost or whose car broke down in a black neighborhood. That lost traveller was like an antelope with a broken limb on the African plain. Except the lions are much nobler and rational. Black youth kill. That is what they do. They do drugs. They rape. A few white idiots who pull hoaxes don&rsquo;t change the social reality of black violence fueled by drugs. </p>
<p>Why drugs? The black has no stimulation from books or great music, and lacks imagination and creativity. Drugs provide a temporary sense of empowerment and vision the black&rsquo;s dull brain cannot provide. </p>
<p>I will say that as we become more reliant on computers, ipods constantly in youths&rsquo; ears in schools, video games and black-based &#8220;rhythm&#8221; music, the brains of young whites increasingly are rotting down to the black level. </p>
<p>Thus the infatuation by white youth with the slick half-breed hustler B.Obama and his slut, philo-African, white-hating wife. </p>
<p>As much as I&rsquo;d love to see a white counter-revolution, the only Americans with white nationalist consciousness are older Americans. Indeed, go to a classical concert in any city. Ninety percent of the audience is 55 or older.  Perhaps the utter collapse of the economy due to Obama&rsquo;s communist policies will break the spell this con man has over the vast majority of white young people. But that may be a wish and not a realistic prediction. </p>

		<p>What I find interesting about this story is that almost no one in the media covered it until it was revealed to be a hoax.  Two black men kidnapping a white woman and her daughter is given limited local coverage, but a hoax about two black men kidnapping a white woman and her daughter is a national news story.  Gee, I wonder why?</p>

		<p>Typical Whiyte bigotry:</p>
<p>Charles Stuart - Killed his wife. blamed it on a Black man.</p>
<p>Susan Smith - Killed her two sons brbrutally drowning them in a lake in South carolina. Blamed A Black man.</p>
<p>We had a case here in my town where a White couple buglarized their own home, broke windows etc&hellip; and blamed it on two young b<br>
Black men. After a two week investigation, they were fined and convicted.</p>
<p>Lord only knows how many innocnet black men are sitting in jail today because some lying, dishonest White person FALSELY accused them of murder, rape, theft etc&hellip;. In fact, even some conservatives have began to come out against the death penalty after seeing how many innocent Blacks and Hisaponics have been wrongly convicted and executed. </p>
<p>Conservative Bob Barr wrote an article in yesterdays New York Times arguing about this issue. In fact, an off duty police officer was shot last week in New York as he was trying to stop a crime!</p>
<p>I myself was harrassed by two White cops when I was 16 years old in the mid 1960s. They made me lie face down on the floor of a police precinct and one of them placed his foot the back of my neck! They eventually realized thatI was innocent and they let me go without even issuing an apology! <br>
 <br>
All you bigots can call me a reverse racist, a lunatic, nutcase, tell me to go back to Africa etc&hellip; Which seems to be your repsonse to anyone who dares speaks the truth, but I don&rsquo;t care! The fact is that Black people in this country are under constant seing by a racist, oppressive, xenophobic, tyrannical system and it must be stopped!</p>

		<p> Notice the AP reporter&rsquo;s name: Jesse Washington. Last White &#8220;Washington&#8221; I ever heard of was George. And also notice that every single person he interviewed for this story was either identified as black, or appeared highly likely to have been black.</p>
<p> This wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;outrage&#8221; or &#8220;disgust&#8221; or something that makes virtuous blacks&rsquo; &#8220;blood boil.&#8221; It was blacks secretly delighted because they think they&rsquo;ve found yet another incident that both validates and feeds their paranoia: &#8220;Everbody&rsquo;s out to get us.&#8221;</p>
<p> Why did Sweeten say it was &#8220;two black men&#8221; who supposedly stuffed her and her daughter into a trunk? Because such an event sounded highly believable. Not to suggest that another race is not capable of it, if it actually had happened. But black men especially have demonstrated the kind of remorseless, brutal disregard for others that could spark such an action   &mdash;   especially against White people not in a position to defend themselves. </p>

		<p>While this woman should be appropriately punished for this, it&rsquo;s all to easy to do this because deep down people know that blacks, in general, tend to act up.  (And I&rsquo;m being nice here.)</p>

This woman is a nut and AmRen, the CofCC and any other pro-white group that holds this story up as anything other than a stupid lie by an unbalanced individual is doing a disservice to their movement. </p>

		<p>Blaming blacks is not necessarily &#8220;racism.&#8221; The lady wanted to be believed, and what is more credible than blaming violent crime on blacks? No one ever blames fake carjackings on Hasidic Jews. Does that mean there&rsquo;s no anti-Semitism? Of course not. If blacks don&rsquo;t want to be used as credible bad guys, they should stop acting badly. Among other things, we do not owe blacks a false view of the world.-DB</p>

		<p>&#8220;What made the hoax believable?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the crux of the problem.<br>
I was listening to a progressive on the radio talking with a psychologist who stated that the man who was in charge of the Department of Housing and recently committed suicide was an example of someone who was focused too narrowly on his problems. At this point the host of the show interrupted her and said that he was troubled by the example she used because it was another example of someone white who was being used as an example. He asked why, when the white women jogger in New York City was attacked and raped by a gang of black youths a while back, was it a big deal in the news media. He claimed to then have looked up the crime statistics to see how many black or hispanic women were raped and it was over 200 in the same period. The point he was making was why didn&rsquo;t the minority women receive the same coverage in the news, as the white woman. A valid point. I then thought to myself that the question of who was doing the raping in both cases was a moot point to the host of the show. I wonder how that discussion would have gone. Not really. I know  &mdash;  nowhere.</p>

<p>So rhapsodizes Comrade Ballentine, irately and expectantly! </p>
<p>But he, and the rest of the blacks in this country, had better be careful about what they are praying for. General Secretary BO, is hardly what they should be wishing that the rest of the country should be looking at as the black &ldquo;success&rdquo; paradigm. If anything else, he is nothing but a slickly packaged and dismally incompetent example of forced affirmative action in action. </p>

		<p>Nothing wrong with blacks being upset over false accusations.</p>
<p>The problem is whites covering up black malfeasance, which is now at social epidemic levels.  It&rsquo;s now part of normal white culture to make excuses for blacks, discriminate in favor of blacks, and ignore black malfeasance.</p>

		<p>Maybe just maybe it&rsquo;s because Black men have much higher crime rates than any other group and when they commit crimes such as carjacking or abduction, they almost always attack Whites.</p>

		<p>I can almost feel sorry for them.  Blacks know perfectly well that they&rsquo;re their own worst enemy, but they desperately want it to be whitey instead.  Of course, if white folks truly WERE the problem, then mother africa would have welcomed all of her black children back many years ago.  </p>

<p>Yeah, Bro, but if there wasn&rsquo;t so much black on white crime the claim would never be made.  It&rsquo;s easy for people to believe that a black was involved in ANY crime, because black males are only 6% of the ENTIRE population in this country, but they commit 58% of ALL VIOLENT CRIMES.</p>
<p>The fault is yours, Jesse, baby.  If you and your kind would bear down hard condemning your vast criminal element you might be able to curtail it and give your race a better image.</p>
<p>But, as it is, you keep your mouth busy making excuses for your brothers, which only encourages them to do even more.</p>
<p>You want people to stop blaming blacks for crime?  Then do something to reduce the out of control black crime in this country.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more to blame than any white, except for the mentally ill liberals who encourage black crime as much as you do.</p>

		<p>In Philadelphia this story was talked about for nine minutes on a sunday half hour talk show called inside story.The round table commentators said things like how sad it is in this day and age we still have this awful stereo type of black males.One commentator said it smacks of the DW Griffen movie birth of a nation.Another black commentator joked and said if he drove a black Cadillac he may have been pulled over.After watching the reaction the host of the show and the commentators had to the story I watched to see how they were going to respond to the story of the black Panther members case of voter intimidation being dismissed.Both stories were local and I thought comparing their reactions to the two would be interesting to watch.It turned out to be a waste of time because the black panther story was not even mentioned.I guess that story was incorrect, Politically speaking.I guess the Panther story was thrown down the memory hole. </p>

<p>While the policemen were disrespectful and arrogant, you mentioned that this took place in the mid 1960s. I am assuming 1965? 1966? That was more than 40 years ago! Why bring it up now?! In fact, I was only in elemntary school (first grade)at this time</p>
<p>I can understand your anger. I probably would have been angry to, but to still be steaming angry about an incident that happended more than four decades ago? </p>

Dennis:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times people here, or anywhere, have told you to go back to Africa. If it happened more than once, maybe there&rsquo;s a reason it keeps coming up.</p>
<p>You complain about how bad white people are but most blacks do everything they can to be around whites.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, know how violent and dangerous black people can be so I do everything I can NOT to be around blacks. Unfortunately, blacks demand that they have to be around me. Apparently blacks have no sense of self-worth unless they&rsquo;re around white people. In fact, most successful blacks base their measure of success on how accepted they are by whites in white social settings.</p>
<p>Which one of us is more intelligent and honest? You who claim white people are bad but insist to be around whites or me who knows how bad blacks can be and consequently, try not be around blacks?</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it Malcolm X who asked the question of the black man, &#8216;why do you go to the grand children of the slave master and expect to be treated differently?&rsquo;</p>
<p>If white people are bad as you say, an intelligent person would avoid them and want to live as far away from them as possible.</p>
<p>If not Africa, maybe you can find a black paradise like say Haiti. There are few bad whites there and lots of loving, kind, caring, noble, generous, giving, peaceful, sharing blacks.</p>
<p>Dennis, the reality that makes you angry is that you, and most blacks, are white supremacists. You know in your heart and soul that you&rsquo;d rather live with &#8216;evil&rsquo; white folk than live with your own kind.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they say the truth hurts.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I myself was harrassed by two White cops when I was 16 years old in the mid 1960s. They made me lie face down on the floor of a police precinct and one of them placed his foot the back of my neck!&#8221; </p>
<p>I can beleive you and I feel sympathy for you. Really I do. It&rsquo;s a terrible shame what happened. But justice is not always perfect and the police do make mistakes. </p>
<p>But I could also tell you of things that happened to me at the hands of blacks, that make your lying on the floor look like children playing. Did you come away bleeding?  Were you hospitalized? Probably you were just angry, that&rsquo;s all. </p>
<p>Ironically, black communities complain constantly about high crime rates and not enough police protection.  Then when they get more police, they complain that they are being picked on.  Can&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>Well, this abuse that you complain about would not be happening if were were separated. Then you could have your OWN police force and we could have ours. Your own neighborhood and ours.  That way you wouldn&rsquo;t be getting mistreated by us, and we wouldn&rsquo;t be mistreated by you.  A deal?<br>

The handful of stories where white women make up a story about a black criminal are page one and have eternal life but the dozens of fake &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; incidents never even make it out of the gate - not to mention the thousands of very real violent black male crimes given one paragraph on one day in the local section.</p>

		<p>The usual double standard at work. AR has documented hundreds of cases of blacks committing hoax crimes and blaming them on whites. Yet the media almost never cover these events. Let one or two whites falsely acuse blacks and the AP is all over it.</p>
<p>Dennis, the black racist, says that it is blacks who are being unjustly accused but it is quite the reverse. He has to go back to the 1988 Charles Stuart case for an example. We can point to monthly examples of black racists falsely accusing whites. And these are only the ones we know about!</p>

<p>I have got news for you. There are Whites who get stopeed by police officers and get pushed around as well. It happened to me in 1990 in California.</p>
<p>At the time I was a college student living in a beach town. I was riding home form a local bar late one night and was pulled over by a cop. I think he saw me as one of those supposedly &#8220;spoiled, rich kids&#8221; because I dressed and looked the part.  I was not wealthy, but I was a solid middle class kid.</p>
<p>The cop ordered me out of the car and slammed me up against my own car, a Mazda at the time. He made a few disrespectful comments and then issued me a ticket. He claimed I was speeding whic I was not. I did not feel like contesting the ticket.</p>

<p><br>
Here&rsquo;s an example, merely a small one, and not the worst either, of the total lack of empathy that victims of  [black] crime must face and endure  &hellip; in this case, women who are raped.  But it applies to all of us, no matter the crime.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story with these women?   Why, they&rsquo;re sickos, that&rsquo;s what!  Nut cases!!! They&rsquo;re given to having <i>&#8220;sick sexual fantasies about Black men&#8221;. </i>  It&rsquo;s how these perverts get their kicks.  We&rsquo;re onto them and their sick game!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, if your&rsquo;re victimized, you have to just swallow the crime and  keep your silence.  Dry your tears and do your crying in private. Grin and bear it. You&rsquo;ll get no sympathy  (except from fellow victims who&rsquo;ve been through the same).   </p>
<p>If you report a crime, or even complain about it, especially to to your liberal friends,they&rsquo;ll look at you askance like you&rsquo;re  a twisted, fantasizing sicko.   How could you possibly say such awful things about blacks?  Shame on you!   If it happened, it&rsquo;s just an freakish, isolated anomaly, that&rsquo;s all.  It has NOTHING to do with race!  And if it really happened (at all) it must somehow  be your own fault. You must have provoked it in some way. Everyone knows that blacks aren&rsquo;t violent, at least not without provocation. It&rsquo;s a racist myth, and if you spread the myth you&rsquo;re feeding racism.  After all, even a friendly dog will bite you if you kick him and torment him enough. With all the suffering that blacks have endured from whites, it&rsquo;s hardly surprising if one snaps now and then. You&rsquo;re just getting what you (collectively) deserve.</p>
<p>Parroted straight out of the socialist textbook!  No, you&rsquo;ll get no sympathy from your liberal friends. Just bite your lip and bear it.</p>

		<p>How many times has anyone heard of a &#8220;the Oriental man did it&#8221; hoax story?</p>
<p>Nobody, however &#8220;racist&#8221; tries that sort of hoax because the underrepresentation of East Asians as violent criminals is so widely known that such a hoax would instantly not be believed.</p>
<p>With &#8220;the black man did it&#8221; hoaxes, they&rsquo;re usually believeable at first.  Why Dennis, do you suppose that is?  Instead of whining about this aspect of the hoaxes, why not be happy that whites and our police departments actually investigate these hoaxes and punish the perpetrators.</p>
<p>However, when a spate of &#8220;noose&#8221; hoaxes creates nationwide hysteria among blacks, none of them are remotely suspicious of what was really going on.  During the Clinton days, when a handful of church-burnings occurred, blacks appeared to WANT to believe this was the work of &#8220;racists&#8221;, when in fact the perpertators were a mixture of black pastors burning their own churches down because they wanted insurance companies to pay for new buildings, and Satanists burning churches down because they&rsquo;re insane.</p>
<p>And Dennis, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you to go back to Africa either, but if living in a nation full of white people is such terrible burden for you, well, there are plenty of places without us.</p>

<p>Actually, incidents of whites falsely accusing blacks are very rare, and certainly pale in comparison to the reverse. If you want to talk about sick sexual fantasies you might take a look at Tawana Brawley and the Duke rape hoaxer (Crystal Gail Mangum). Real incidents of white men raping black women are like about as common as unicorns. Yet these - and other - black women concoct some of the most perverted scenarios about rape and white men.</p>
<p>And while we are on the subject of sick sexual fantaises let&rsquo;s not forget the millions of rapes black men commit against white women (and other non-black women) every year.</p>

<p>Back in the 1960&rsquo;s, police were not very concerned about &#8220;rights&#8221; of any group including Whites. There has been plenty of mistreatment of Whites by the police in the past and there are still incidents today. I don&rsquo;t agree with mistreatment of any race by the police but the police are right to be more suspicious of groups that commit more crime.</p>

 &#8220;I have news for you. There are Whites who get stopeed by police officers and get pushed around as well.  I was riding home form a local bar late one night and was pulled over by a cop.  [He] ordered me out of the car and slammed me up against my own car.  He made a few disrespectful comments and then issued me a ticket. He claimed I was speeding, which I was not. <b> I did not feel like contesting the ticket.</b><br>
My point is that it is not only Blacks who are mistreated by the police.&#8221;<br>

That&rsquo;s a good point!   Especially about avoiding a confrontation by not contesting the cop&rsquo;s authority.  When I was in my twenties,  I too was stopped, frisked, and questioned  by the police various times   &mdash;    just for walking down the street late at night, or taking a short cut through a parking lot.  I don&rsquo;t recall that they apologized to me either.  No big deal. </p>
<p>The big difference to be noted, as with Vince above, is the variance in responses between blacks and whites.   </p>
<p>When stopped by police,  however upsetting it may be, the best thing  is to remain calm, respectful, and keep your mouth shut. Do exactly as instructed. Answer his questions and be civil. Then you&rsquo;ll have no further trouble.  Many blacks, on the other hand, escalate the situation.  They have to get mouthy, argue,  and tell the cops off   &mdash;   a very unwise thing to do!   After all,  the officer has the badge, the gun, and all the authority   &mdash;   while you do not. </p>
<p>Next thing, the mouthy black guy will be under arrest (or in the hospital), screaming racism and brutality, while the respectful white guy is let go.   I wonder why?<br>

		<p>However, the Philadelphia PD looked for the reported Cadillac sedan that allegedly rearended Ms. Sweeten&rsquo;s SUV and found a Cadillac with front end damage in the Hunting Park section of Philly.  OK, it turned out to not to be the alleged car but</p>
<p>Mayor Nutter and Chief Ramsey, both black, pursued the case based on the woman&rsquo;s story. Who better than they are well aware of the cause of most of Philadelphia&rsquo;s and most of any urban area&rsquo;s problems?</p>
<p>Mayor Nutter ( May I call you Mike?) Don&rsquo;t run for re-election!<br>
Spend time with your wife and kids. They love you. Black Philadelphia has betrayed you.  A large segment of The Black population has seemingly gone out of its way to embarrass you!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a good guy. Go and enjoy the rest of your life!!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;In fact, an off duty police officer was shot last week in New York as he was trying to stop a crime!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The off-duty officer did not follow police protocol and turned facing the White officer with his gun drawn.  As Heather McDonald writes in City Journal:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;when Dunton shouted at Edwards to drop his gun, Edwards was supposed to comply&hellip;. The NYPD Patrol Guide puts the burden on an officer confronted by a fellow officer to provide his identity. He must &#8216;remain motionless, even if it means a fleeing suspect may escape,&rsquo; according to the Patrol Guide, and he should &#8216;not turn [his] body, especially if holding a firearm.&rsquo; &hellip;. But the fact remains that Edwards did not follow department protocol devised precisely to avoid such tragic mistakes&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/qzn8cl" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/qzn8cl</a></p>
<p>In a split second, the White officer saw a black man with a gun drawn on him and performed the correct action, therefore he was able to return to his loved ones after his shift ended.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Which seems to be your repsonse to anyone who dares speaks the truth, but I don&rsquo;t care!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is the TRUTH Whites receive from the msm and government officials whenever a black-on-White attack occurs:</p>
<p>Capt. David Waltemeyer, commander of the county Police Department&rsquo;s Criminal Investigation Division, said&hellip;&rsquo;though the victim was white and the suspects are black, there is no indication that the incident was racially motivated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;It doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with race,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/pnfg6n</p>
<p>It never does unless a White is perceived, correctly or not, to be the criminal.  Ask the falsely accused Duke boys  &mdash;  guilty until proven innocent.</p>
<p>The huge number of black-on-White crime indicate blacks intentionally HUNT Whites and target them for rape, murder, robbery, torture and other vile and despicable acts.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something you will never read in the MSM.  According to them, it is Whites who target blacks for vicious crimes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;For 20 years, black criminals have targeted whites more than they have blacks (45 vs. 43 percent in recent years, with ten percent of their victims Hispanic)&hellip; La Griffe du Lion concluded, regarding black-on-white crime:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;In the city, the races live mostly apart from one another, so that the most convenient victims of thugs are others of the same race. Only a hunter&rsquo;s mentality could account for the data.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
