			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kurt Nimmo, Prison Planet.com, Monday, June 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A report posted on the Kentucky Justice &amp; Public Safety Cabinet website mentions the Kentucky chapter of the Constitution Party. The 2006 report, entitled &#8220;Hate Crime and Hate Incidents in the Commonwealth,&#8221; characterizes the paleoconservative political party as a patriot group and associates it with the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations.</p>
<p>The report cites &#8220;hate crime&#8221; statistics produced by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, organizations that have made a cottage industry out of conflating the patriot movement and racist groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Kentucky report lists the Constitution Party in a table along with Take Back Kentucky, Ranch Rescue, and the Kentucky State Militia. &#8220;Patriot groups define themselves as opposed to the &#8216;New World Order&rsquo; or advocate or adhere to extreme anti-government or conspiratorial doctrines,&#8221; a caveat below the table states. &#8220;Listing here does not imply that the groups themselves advocate or engage in violence or other criminal activities, or are racist. This list was compiled from field reports, Patriot publications, the Internet, law enforcement officials and news reports. Source: Southern Poverty Law Center.&#8221;</p>
<p>If patriot groups are not racist, why are they included in a report that concentrates on &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; and the Ku Klux Klan?</p>
<p>As previously noted on Infowars and Prison Planet, the SPLC and the ADL are in the business of demonizing the patriot and larger paleoconservative and libertarian movement as dangerous terrorists on the radical and &#8220;extremist&#8221; fringe of the American political landscape. Including the Constitution Party  &mdash;  now considered a mainstream political party  &mdash;  in a report dwelling on the Imperial Klans of America and the neo-Nazi American National Socialist Workers&rsquo; Party is part of a concerted effort to delegitimize and stigmatize the patriot movement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Kentucky Justice &amp; Public Safety Cabinet needs to remove this obvious and defamatory propaganda from its website immediately (or at minimum remove mention of patriot groups from this SPLC-ADL produced report). The Kentucky Justice &amp; Public Safety Cabinet&rsquo;s office secretary may be reached at (502) 564-7554.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous that special interest groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center are used as sources, as if they aren&rsquo;t biased or slanted towards their agenda.</p>
<p>Using them as a source introduces bias and discredits the report.</p>

		<p>The report &#8220;cites&#8221; the ADL and SPLC because they are plagiaristic reprints of SPLC and ADL material.  I&rsquo;m betting the two 2006 incidents listed here were self-inflicted by the minority in question.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I find the title of this publication to be about the most accurate descriptor of what the SPLC and ADL would like the world to become, a prison planet of &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; or a gulag globe of multiculturalism. In the end, I could go on and on about what Marxist and totalitarian entities these groups are, but we all pretty much know the score with them. Like all crooked or bent prison custodians, they simply thrive on holding power over those who are deemed &ldquo;criminals,&rdquo; particularly the ones who do not really even fit into that mold accurately. Why else would the want to &ldquo;criminalize&rdquo; thought and other legal political expressions?</p>
<p>This is their idea of a perfect society:</p>

<p>Encouraging disunity and instigating riots are great fun; just so long as they get to slam the bars shut for themselves that is, and not be touched by it!<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just the free flow of information. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed. There&rsquo;s no problem with it as long as the same hate-crime folks associate the deaths of 500,000 whites at the hands of blacks in the USA with the Democratic party and hate too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Liberals&#8221; are not just mentally impaired. Despite their &#8220;smily&#8221; appearances, they are hostile towards anybody and anything that they perceive as an obstacle for implementation of their &#8220;liberal&#8221; utopia.</p>
<p>If you disregard mask of &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and &#8220;humanitarianism&#8221; that most of them use, what is left are&#8221;: hostility, arrogance, and (self-inflicted?) mental disability.<br>

<p>Make no mistake about it, the SPLC and the ADL are behind this infiltration of police departments all over the country.</p>
<p>Just the other evening Shepard Smith, Fox News, was bad mouthing the tea party people, and WND for wanting to see Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate, and third party candidates as &#8220;scary,&#8221; and guess who his expert gues was?  Yes, none other than this Heidi Beirich (SP?) of the SPLC.  That, of course, is like getting an opinion from Barny Frank on Republicans.  The only thing espoused will be a pack of lies and obscene exaggerations.</p>
<p>That man is just too stupid to be a news anchor.  With his left wing advocacy, he needs to go over to NBC.</p>
<p>I refuse to watch the News on Fox at 7 P.M., and instead watch Lou Dobbs for that hour.<br>

		<p>It seems that the organizations listed do not &#8220;hate&#8221; per se, just promote views that are not popular with minorities. (Not that minorities are excluded, mind you.) Is every organization that blacks and hispanics are not beating down the door to join going to become &#8220;hate&#8221; groups? </p>

		<p>Paleoconservatism is just another dead-end street for our people anyway. Paleocons(while generally preferable to Neo&rsquo;s and movement-cons)are still in denial about race and how critical total honesty on that issue is is to a healthy, stable society. In fact, it seems to me that Paleos are actually growing even more cowardly on the race issue, and further distancing themselves from, or even denouncing anyone who speaks the truth about this issue. </p>
<p>Personally, I would rather take a more liberal thinker who is willing to be honest about race(and they do exist - I know several personally) than a hardcore conservative who is in denial of the one issue that matters most to our people. </p>

		<p>The colonials who engaged in revolution against the British crown in the 1700s would also have been smeared with the &#8220;hate&#8221; label in their day if it existed. It just would have been hatred against the king and government. To a large extent this label is used mainly by people who want to maintain the existing order of things or suppress white Americans. It is a dirty form of politics by low-class people, nothing more.</p>

		<p>Modern liberal authortarianism not only is repressive but it is married to a host of disparate false ideologies that do not benefit the citizens of this country.. not even the ones the worldview claims to benefit. Freedom lovers long for the day when the people throw off the yoke of this repressive belief system and take back the basic freedoms earlier generations once enjoyed.</p>

		<p>To Ranger and all AR Readers:</p>
<p>Here are some videos of Comrade Heidi, including the one with Comrade Shep:</p>

<p>As you can see in the first video, Comrade Heidi is quite the &ldquo;looker;&rdquo; in fact, she perfectly represents her politics and organization in the flesh.</p>
<p>Enjoy and all the best,</p>

		<p>#14 John PM thanks for the video of Comrade Heidi. It is interesting how demented these leftists are. While explaining that Tanton&rsquo;s concern was overpopulation, she goes on to say that he turned into an immigrant hater,etc. because they have too many children. HUH!! One of the main obsessions of the left is supposedly the environment. How they never make the connection between the health of the environment and over-population, either shows how stupid these people are, or how downright evil they are. I can&rsquo;t see any other reason. Thanks for the video. Every once in a while it helps to be reminded of how crazy these leftists are.</p>

		<p>Everytime the SPLC is used as a source to smear a patriotic, nationalist, or legitimate poltical group, we should contact media and complain that a moneymaking machine that spends little of its funds to fight &#8220;poverty&#8221; in teh courts is cited as an expert on US political groups. It is not an expert. Too many legitimate organizations like the Constitution Party, VDARE and FAIR among others have been labelled racist by the busybody SPLC.</p>
