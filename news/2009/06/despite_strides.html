<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The year America inaugurated its first black president will also be known as the year this small Delta cotton hub voted its first black mayor out of office.</p>
<p>Mayor Sheriel F. Perkins was up for reelection Tuesday, running on a promise to &#8220;move Greenwood forward, together.&#8221; But half a century after the ugliness that reigned here during the civil rights era  &mdash;  black voter registration efforts met with beatings and police dogs  &mdash;  this city of 18,000 has settled into a civil but enduring separateness.</p>
<p>The muddy Yazoo River cuts through the heart of town, serving as the unofficial boundary between black and white Greenwood. The black majority is to the south, in middle-class bungalows and decrepit shotguns. The white minority lives mostly in the north in handsome suburban-style homes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Tuesday, north Greenwood&rsquo;s wide, well-tended lawns were festooned with forest-green signs touting the new challenger, Carolyn McAdams. She is white. White adults waved campaign signs at passing drivers. White children were everywhere in green campaign T-shirts.</p>
<p>McAdams, 61, had cast herself, as had Perkins, as a unifying figure.</p>
<p>Many blacks, she said, had come to trust her in her years working at the nearby private prison and, before that, at the housing authority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But color, as many voters acknowledged, was at the heart of this election. McAdams&rsquo; supporters had few direct criticisms of the sitting mayor&rsquo;s performance, though some were turned off by her numerous liens for nonpayment of taxes.</p>
<p>What they really didn&rsquo;t like, they said, was the black political clique surrounding her  &mdash;  especially the clique&rsquo;s gray eminence, state Sen. David Jordan. It was Jordan, 76, who filed a lawsuit that ultimately led to blacks being elected to the City Council, where they have held a majority for a number of years.</p>
<p>These days, white voters said in interviews, it seemed like it was the black clique that was dividing the city by constantly playing the race card.</p>
<p>&#8220;They keep something going all the time between the blacks and whites,&#8221; said Betty Killebrew, 72. &#8220;And it doesn&rsquo;t need to be that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the atmosphere here was perfectly friendly. Marquii Washington, one of a handful of blacks standing by a Perkins sign on the north side, said whites asked after him throughout the hot day, offering him cold drinks and shade.</p>
<p>But as Washington watched whites flock to their polling places, he encountered a number of blacks who told him they weren&rsquo;t going to vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Henry [Mac Henry, a Perkins volunteer] used the old Malcolm X formulation about &#8220;field Negroes&#8221; and &#8220;house Negroes&#8221; to explain why whites didn&rsquo;t like the ruling black clique: People like Sen. Jordan, he said, were from the field  &mdash;  fighters, not pushovers. The mayor, he said, was from neither house nor field, but a &#8220;breakout&#8221; character who could bring real unity.</p>
<p>At dinnertime, Perkins&rsquo; supporters gathered in a church basement and fell silent as they watched the poll results roll in like a bad storm: 57% for McAdams, 43% for Perkins. In the north, Perkins received 54 votes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A few black faces mingled happily in the crowd. McAdams had earned about 270 south-side votes: {snip}</p>

		<p>Greenwood is a typical black ghetto, for the most part.  This is why Carrollton and Carroll County is popular white flight destination.</p>
<p>Trivia:  A number of generations back in John McCain&rsquo;s lineage was Carroll County, Mississippi, and a slave holding family.  In fact, a bunch of McCains, both white and black, still live there, and every once in awhile have something of a family reunion.  Their most famous relative has yet to show up. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the way it is every place where blacks are in large numbers.  If one wants to see bias, prejudice, and racism at its most intense levels, just go to a black run city or county.</p>
<p>Race is first, last and always with these people over every other thing in the universe.</p>
<p>And it is same way with Obama, and his wife&hellip;&hellip;especially his wife.  And look at how much praise and support he received from black &#8220;Republicans,&#8221; like Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice and others.  Race trumps everything with them.  Then they have the bold faced audacity to complain about racism.</p>

I said during the presidential election that voting in a black man while whites are still the majority might work to our advantage in the long run.</p>
<p>After everyone gets over the novelty of &#8216;the first black president&rsquo;, people might be inclined to not simply vote for a black candidate.</p>
<p>Listening to black radio, I know that blacks expect that once they make it into an elected office, they believe their ship has come in but more importantly, &#8216;once you vote in a black, there&rsquo;s no going back&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But blacks are the ones most disappointed by the lack luster performance of their black elected officials. Although they hate to admit it, once blacks are elected and fail, blacks fall back after everyone sees how badly they do in office.</p>
<p>Just last week, AR posted a story that noted that after Reconstruction, blacks made up a majority of elected officials. </p>

		<p>This is the usual case, Blacks get power in a small town and then begin to loudly voice their complaints to the Whites who live there using slavery terms although there has not been a slave in the US for almost than 150 years. </p>

		<p>This is typical of the leftist media. Apparently when a black is elected to office, that position should forever belong to a black. If a black politician is voted out after one term, it&rsquo;s because of White racism. If a particular political office is held by a black for years and then a White is voted in office, blacks and their toadies in the media howl over the fact that a position previously held by a black is now going to a White. Once again White racism is the cause. </p>
<p>According to the 2000 census, the racial makeup of Greenwood was 32.82% White, and 65.36% black. With numbers like these, an incumbent black can&rsquo;t lose unless blacks don&rsquo;t vote for him or her. This is the reason Perkins lost, as stated by this quote;<br>
&#8220;But as Washington watched whites flock to their polling places, he encountered a number of blacks who told him they weren&rsquo;t going to vote.&#8221; Greenwood&rsquo;s blacks didn&rsquo;t vote for Perkins, but Fausset expects White to do so. </p>
<p>I guess racism is the only way a White can win any election when they are pitted against a black. The media tells us so, and so it must be true.</p>

		<p>The author seems to be stretching a bit to turn this into a story. The incumbent lost and there was a race element - that isn&rsquo;t news. </p>
<p>The obvious comparison to recent events wasn&rsquo;t made - that last year most blacks switched their support from Hilary Clinton to Obama, because of racial solidarity and separateness.</p>

		<p>Q, I don&rsquo;t understand the complaining and whining about black racism. Yes, blacks are a different race and they have a natural right to exist and be ruled by their own. As do whites.</p>

		<p>The racism card is all that blacks know how to do when confronted by failures of their own race. They never look at themselves in a critical fashion because they won&rsquo;t like what they see. So better to play off the guilt of whites to advance in life. little wonder they are so despised by everyone who works hard to make it in life. these freeloading blacks are just nuisances and a major drag on a culture that likes to go forward. A white mayor is much better than a black mayor ever could be.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree that blacks if they are in majority should be able to run the city as they see fit. For one thing, their incompetence will only be a further drain on state and federal revenues. It also sets up expectations that can&rsquo;t be met. An &#8220;empowered&#8221; black majority city is not suddenly made prosperous. The black view is that past economic prosperity was simply the result of government doling out its riches to White people. They don&rsquo;t accept that it is Whites that made the money, and that whatever money the government had came as a result of White entrepreneurship. Now that they are in power, blacks believe that the goose can be commanded to lay golden eggs.  </p>

		<p>When blacks vote for other blacks, often at a 90% or higher level, as they did for Obama, the press is fine with that.  It is considered to be normal and expected behavior.  Indeed, the most recent voting rights act mandates racial gerrymandering under the theory that blacks can only be properly represented by other blacks.  But if whites vote for other whites, at a level as high as, say, 60%, the press goes in a tizzy about evil white racism.  And God help anyone who says that whites can only be properly represented by other whites.</p>

		<p>So a Black was voted out of office. How is that &#8220;racist&#8221; pray tell? Also, I&rsquo;m sick of of the LA Times or the NY Times and the &#8220;limo liberal&#8221; reporters who make sure they don&rsquo;t live around any Blacks, falsely accusing the South of racism.</p>
