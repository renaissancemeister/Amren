			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk (Virginia) Examiner, May 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Thursday, pharmacist Jerome Ersland was freed on a $100,000 bond, after Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater charged him with first-degree murder. On May 19, Ersland shot and killed Antwun Parker, 16, while Parker and two other accomplices attempted to rob the Reliable Discount Pharmacy.</p>
<p>The charges allege that Ersland shot Parker five times in the abdomen, while Paker was lying on his back and incapacitated. The prosecutor claims that the robber no longer presented a threat because Ersland had already shot Parker once in the head and was supposedly unconscious. .</p>
<p>Ersland claims that he continued to shoot at Parker because was getting back up, and feared for his life.</p>
<p>One of the conditions of Ersland&rsquo;s bail is that he have no access to firearms. In a strange turn of events, District Attorney Prater argued that if Ersland goes back to work at the pharmacy, he should be allowed to arm himself.</p>
<p>Prater told the court: &#8220;I worry about his safety. He&rsquo;s already had threats. I worry about his safety, being at work without a weapon.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the judge disagreed and demanded that Ersland remained unarmed until the case is decided.</p>
<p>Shortly after Ersland killed Parker, an angry black mob gathered outside the pharmacy, shouting profanities and threats at Ersland. The 57-year-old Gulf War veteran has reportedly received several threats since the shooting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, police arrested 14-year-old Jevontia Ingram who is an alleged accomplice in the attempted robbery. Ingram is now in a juvenile detention facility.</p>
<p>Also in custody, is the alleged get-away driver, 32-year-old Emanuel Dewayne Mitchell. Ersland ran outside in pursuit of one of the armed robbers and pointed his gun at Mitchell, at which time Mitchell sped away, and actually wrecked the silver Honda he was driving. Police arrested Mitchell shortly thereafter, and discovered that the car was stolen.</p>
<p>Mitchell is a convicted armed robber and kidnapper.</p>
<p>*Reporter&rsquo;s note: {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The district attorney is undoubtedly trying to score points with Oklahoma County&rsquo;s black voters, many of whom have tried to paint this shooting as racially motivated.</p>

		<p> There seems to be little doubt that, as reporter Gibson said, the district attorney is trying to play the multi-cultural hero, prosecuting a White man to please the black mob   &mdash;   probably in hopes of helping his re-election chances.</p>
<p> Quite frankly I&rsquo;m sick of seeing surveillance videos in which arrogant black thugs terrorize store clerks, who seldom try to fight back. Bravo for Mr. Ersland, who DID fight back. If more store owners and clerks not only kept guns on their premises, but also used them against these brazen thieves, the rate of store robberies would drop like a rock. </p>

		<p>The incident happened three days before Ersland was arrested.  I noted that he was only given $100,000 bond, a very low bail considering what he was charged with, Murder 1st.  I think the D.A.&rsquo;s office had to do something to throw a bone to the NAACP, after all the noise quiets, the charges against Ersland will be dropped.</p>

		<p>David Prater deserves to follow Mike Nifong into disgrace, disbarment and infamy.  No white person defending himself from some feral black intent on committing robbery and murder can expect justice from the likes of such &#8220;officers of the law.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m serious: a campaign should be mounted there in OKC to vote Prater out the very next election.</p>

		<p>If this pharmacist plays it right on this pre-trial nonsense, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;ll be in line for a fairly good civil suit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that the some of the &#8220;good old boys&#8221; (And especially girls) make better PC advocates than their mentally disturbed comrads from the North, but for the most part they&rsquo;re a pretty common sense bunch, so I can&rsquo;t see them convicting this guy.</p>
<p>This prosecutor needs a good &#8220;Nifonging&#8221; to straighten out his maligned intent, and he&rsquo;s just apt to get it in this case also.  </p>

		<p>This reminds me of a story in Los Angeles where a jewlery store owner shot and killed a couple of black thugs in his store and was threatened by blacks after he killed them. He had to close up shop. From then on, he only conducted business out of his home. <br>
Suppose the pharmacist did shoot the black perp in the adomen after he shot him in the head and the black was lying unconscous on his back and no longer posed a threat? If you can&rsquo;t kill a person after he pulls a gun on you, when can you kill him? After he shoots you in the head? In a combat situation, when the bullets are flying and the adrenaline is running high, it&rsquo;s always a kill or be killed situation. This black could&rsquo;ve always got up again and started firing even after getting shot in the head, the bullet may have just richochet off his skull and temporarly knocked him out. It&rsquo;s always easy to do monday morning quarterbacking and it&rsquo;s especially easy to make laws that says you can&rsquo;t kill a person after he pulls a gun on you even after you shoot him and he no longer appears to be a threat. These laws are stupid and the D.A should drop this case. I never did understand laws like this. The robber got what he deserved, regardless of what color his skin was. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of a police officer being charged with firing too many bullets.  </p>
<p>If the first bullet was a lawful shot, then the subsequent bullets should also be lawful, as long as they are taken with the intent to neutralize a threat.  A wounded man can still be lethal. </p>
<p>The implication is that it was a &#8216;coup de grace&rsquo;. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case, considering the quick decisions Ersland had to make (other robbers were on site, threatening the safety of all in the vicinity).  </p>
<p>The charge should be dropped before making it to court.</p>

		<p>The reason the pharmist is being charged is because after the initial robbery, and probably justified use of self defense, one of the suspects was still in the store unconcious.  At the very least the pharmist probably wasn&rsquo;t obligated to keep this fellow alive and could have simply let him &#8220;bled out&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Instead he finished him off an unconscious individual with five rounds.  Granted I think the world is probably a better place because of what the defendant did but I still think its murder.  He deliberately went back and sought out someone did not pose a threat (the assailant was unconscious)and pit five rounds into.</p>
<p>To me that&rsquo;s a deliberate pre meditated action.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say whether or not I would vote to convict him on a jury but I have no doubt if I were D.A. I would certainly file charges.  Shooting unconscious people, no matter how reprehensible they may be, is unacceptable for police officiers and certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be accepted behaviour for the general public.</p>

		<p>Antwun Parker is 16? What in dog years? That&rsquo;s the oldest looking sixteen year old I&rsquo;ve ever seen. As to blacks gathering outside the pharmacy, who cares. Blacks don&rsquo;t care that these guys were robbers. Blacks always excuse their own no matter how bad they are. </p>

<p>Blacks paint EVERYTHING as racially motivated. If it moves it is &#8220;racist&#8221;. If it doesn&rsquo;t move it is &#8220;racist&#8221;. This is the black mentality. Note how blacks DON&rsquo;T see robbing a White as &#8220;racially motivated&#8221; though.</p>

		<p>Mr Ersland just saved society thousands of dollars in stolen property, court fees, and prison upkeep by eliminating Antwun while he was still a teenager. Imagine how much damage he would do by the time he was 36? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping Mr Ersland will walk. Even if convicted in the politically correct hysteria of the moment, his appeals would stand a good chance of reversing any conviction. I hate thieves and white or black I feel they deserve death. </p>

		<p>I think our side is looking real good on this one.</p>
<p>The charge of 1st degree murder makes a conviction almost impossible. And if the US constitution is still in effect, it is illegal to charge the same person twice for the same alleged crime, so the government can&rsquo;t come back and charge him with manslaughter, though the Feds seemed to wave this right for defendants in the Rodney King beating. Once found innocent, the Feds come back and try the White guy on Federal Civil Rights charges.</p>
<p>But other things that area really good is that the dead robber is not a first timer, forced to do a crime to pay for food for his wife and children, medical school tuition to achieve his dream of saving poor Black children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mitchell is a convicted armed robber and kidnapper&#8221;</p>
<p>He did it before, came back to do it again - only now he can&rsquo;t do it anymore as some regular White guy defended himself and his employees.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t let any White person start splitting legal hairs about making an extra shot after the criminal was no longer a violent threat.</p>
<p>Just go with the idea that any NW criminal or any criminal - armed with guns/knives - breaks in to your home or your business threatens to murder you if you don&rsquo;t submit to their demands - this is clear cut case where the NW criminal has no rights except to have the tax payers to help pay for his funeral expenses and we&rsquo;re not paying for medical expenses - and thanks be to Jerome Ersland for finishing the job and saving the tax payers a lot of money.</p>
<p>We should run this guy - Jerome Ersland for governor of Oklahoma.</p>

		<p>I have been following this story since it came out. The DA is now charging the 14 year old with murder as well as the two adults that talked them into it.</p>
<p>The pharmacist could easily get off. By the way, the photo above is of the getaway driver, not the deceased 16 year old robber. </p>
<p>The actual store surveillance video of the shooting can be found in this article of anyone is interested:<br>

		<p>Although Mr.Ersland may have overreacted due to an Adrenaline rush caused by two armed thugs coming into his store. I heard his explanation on the O&rsquo;Reilly factor and it really didn&rsquo;t seem plausible. He must also have considered that when Antwun recovered he would come back looking to even the score.</p>
<p>The fact still remains that when you come to do violence to others you must accept the possibility that your own violence may be turned against you.  Antwun ( I assume that Mama couldn&rsquo;t spell Antoine) earned  the proverbial wages of sin. He was old enough at 15 to know what he was doing. As an aside I have to say that he doesn&rsquo;t look a day over 40.</p>
<p>Mr. Ersland will be hounded ad infinitum as was Berhardt Goetz. I&rsquo;m sure that the usual suspects AKA Sharpton, Jackson, Quanell X et al will be showing up in Oklahoma City to stir the pot a bit more and of course we&rsquo;ll here the usual cries for more firearms control. If he doesn&rsquo;t go to prison he will probably lose his business, home and God knows what else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also impressed by the speedy arrival of the angry black mob spewing their obscenities and threats.  They must have a real good &#8220;Community Organizer&#8221; in OC.</p>
<p>As General Jack D. Ripper, CO of Burpleson AFB would say, &#8220;Nice shooting soldier&#8221;!</p>

		<p>Even if Mr. Ersland did as the prosecutor claims, he still did the right thing.  In today&rsquo;s legal climate, it makes no sense to leave a robber/burglar still alive if you&rsquo;ve shot him; he&rsquo;ll only sue you afterward and make your life a living hell.  Best to finish the job.  Not only that but, in all probability, Mr. Ersland saved innocent lives by preventing a dangerous criminal from preying upon others in the future.  We&rsquo;ve seen the angry black mob that supports one of their own thugs.  Where are the angry white mobs who support a hero of their own?</p>

		<p>It never ceases to amaze me how blacks will constantly excuse and defend black thugs and criminals in their neighborhood.  Show me any other group who defend the worst elements in their society.  You don&rsquo;t see whites defending their criminals.  They want them removed from society where they can cause no further harm.  Is it any wonder there is rampant crime in black areas.  Instead of threatening and protesting the store owner, these blacks should be backing the police and all law abiding citizens.  Don&rsquo;t hold your breath.  </p>

		<p>They know this man did what he had to do to defend his life.  That&rsquo;s why they pulled something ridiculous out like the black robber posed no threat, even though he had a gun pointed at the pharmaceutical worker a second ago.  They do this sort of thing all the time to convict somebody for defending themselves.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody is catering for black votes, but whatever the case, a white man has been charged for defending himself from black thugs.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why less and less white people defend themselves from non-white attackers?  They see stories like this, and they take the hint.  If you are white and you defend yourself from a non-white, there&rsquo;s a chance you will be charged.  That&rsquo;s why we have to show that these people are heroes for what they&rsquo;ve done, not murderers.  </p>

<p>If you get your brains blown out the back of your head because the fancy for murder strikes him, the dull eyed homicidal pychopath will claim the gun &#8220;just went off&#8221; and he&rsquo;ll see maybe 2 or 3 years in behind bars. His &#8220;youthful&#8221; status will probably result in a lenient sentence, and he&rsquo;ll probably enjoy his brief stay behind bars commanding considerable respect from his peers.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be dead and while your body is being lowered into the casket as your family weeps, his fat loud mouth mama will be hollering and carrying on like a clown in front of the news cameras outside the courthouse proclaiming what a &#8220;good boy&#8221; he is and how he just fell in with the wrong crowd.</p>
<p>I imagine something along these lines flashed through Mr. Ersland&rsquo;s mind when he pulled the trigger. <br>

<p>I think your right.  In order to convict someone of murder, the prosecutor must prove every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt.  Even if Ersland intended to kill the robber by firing those 5 shots, if he was already dead Ersland cannot be convicted of murder.  <br>
Even if the robber were alive when Ersland pumped the last 5 shots into him, he has a decent chance of being found not guilty.  All Ersland has to do is say that the robber was reaching for his gun and that he was in reasonable fear of his life.  This is grounds for claiming self-defense.<br>
Although I&rsquo;m an attorney, I do not practice criminal law.  However, I did get top paper in criminal law while in law school.  The DA is probably charging Ersland with 1st degree murder to try to get a plea bargain.  Due to the tenseness of the situation and the fact that this all occured in a matter of seconds, it will be difficult to prove pre-meditation.  At worst, this is second degree murder. <br>
Also, don&rsquo;t forget the possibility of jury nullification.  If Ersland&rsquo;s lawyer is worth his salt, Ersland will never serve a day in jail.</p>

		<p>Too bad that somebody didn&rsquo;t accidentally (on purpose) shoot out that video surveillance camera that shows the pharmacist shooting the guy 5 more times.  But he did say on O&rsquo;Reilly this evening that he was afraid for a woman and her daughter who were also in the store and that he wasn&rsquo;t sure if they had been hurt because he heard the mother screaming.  Nobody and I mean nobody knows how they would react when confronted by a thug with a gun pointed in your face.  This is old west justice pure and simple.  And I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the prosecutor is going to play the race card to the hilt in this case.  What else can he do?  Any show of sympathy for Mr. Ersland and it will be all out rioting in Oklahoma.  Can you imagine what would have happened had there been no charges filed against this guy.  </p>

		<p>Unlike that pissant Nyfong, this prosecutor has a video surveillance tape and as I said above, I wish one of the bullets either from Mr. Ersland or the thugs had hit the camera and knocked it out.  However, Mr. Ersland&rsquo;s attorney, I don&rsquo;t believe will have a hard time convincing a jury that Mr. Ersland acted in self-defense, not to mention that Mr. Ersland just had spinal cord surgery and is probably on medication.  Some pain medications come with pretty harsh side effects.  Of course, if Mr Erslandis acquitted, I would probably guess that he won&rsquo;t be able to work at that particular pharmacy in the future.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something terribly wrong in a country where lowlife thugs are elevated as martyrs simply because they are black.  </p>

		<p>The real lesson here is what a shooter needs to do after the shooting to protect himself.  If for example the shooter thought the perp was no longer a threat and went ahead and shot him five more times then the prosecutor may have a good case.  But how would the prosecutor ever know that if instead the pharmacist had insisted on talking to an attorney first.  By the time he then talked to the police it would have been &#8220;obvious&#8221; that the shooter was still moving and that the pharmcist thought he still had the gun and not only that he thought there were customers cowering in the aisles that needed protection so he couldn&rsquo;t simply run out and wait for the police.  Get the drift.  Never, never ever talk to the police before you talk to an attorney.</p>

<p>Here in Florida <i>anyone</i> who commits in a crime in which loss of life results is automatically guilty of Murder 1, even if the corpse is one of the perps. So if Tyrone and Jamal rob a store and the owner (or a bystander) kills Jamal, Tyrone is now a 1st-degree murderer. Looks like the law is the same in Oklahoma.</p>

		<p>If these thugs had killed the pharmacist, this would hardly be newsworthy. I guess we now know that a White life taken in agression is not worth a black life taken in self defense.</p>
<p>The moment you walk into a bank, a store, a home with a gun intending to rob or harm, anything that happens to you from that point is fair game. No one can be asked to be reasonable when a gun has been pointed at them while they are going about their workday or their homelife. Once interupted by the threat of violence, who knows what a person will do? That is a great reason to avoid robbing people. Of course this is not good enough for the Leftists and Africanists among us. To satisfy this crazy mob, we must ensconce violent thugs in a protective legal safety net, OSHA for armed robbers. Somehow the intended victim is supposed to assess the threat level from second to second, moment to moment and scale their response to that threat to protect his assailant(s). The intended victim is supposed to remain a victim, supposed to lie down and give the thug whatever he wants. If the thug decides he wants you to die for being a productive White person, well then you are just expected to lie there and die. I don&rsquo;t care if this law-abiding, Veteran, White pharmacist (a community asset) had carved this worthless thug up with a paring knife in order to protect himself and his customers.  Empty a clip into him, reload, then empty the next into his dead body. It&rsquo;s the criminal&rsquo;s fault, not the law abiding citizen&rsquo;s. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The charges allege that Ersland shot Parker five times in the abdomen, while Paker was lying on his back and incapacitated. The prosecutor claims that the robber no longer presented a threat because Ersland had already shot Parker once in the head and was supposedly unconscious.&#8221;</p>
<p>  Of course, automatics can empty a clip in seconds. Mr. Ersland<br>
was a vet and may have been taught to make sure the man was no longer a threat.  I don&rsquo;t know if the robber was still holding his gun or had dropped it. The courts will have to sort that one out. On the surface shooting a man on the ground looks bad.</p>

<p>Agreed, and it&rsquo;s because of the fact I agree completely with your second sentence that if I were on the grand jury I would not even vote to indict him.</p>
<p>As a native Zoo Yorker, I have a firm memory of the Bernhard Goetz incident.  Four black thugs surrounding a lone White, looking for an easy score.  God only knows what they would have done to him had he not shot them.  The jury saw it that way and voted for acquittal of the more serious charges.  It&rsquo;s a shame they didn&rsquo;t acquit him of all the charges.  I would have.</p>
<p>jewamongyou is right.  Had Mr. Ersland not finished off &#8220;Antwun,&#8221; in all probability he would have preyed upon someone else down the road, possibly killing them.  Few people remember, the only one of the four thugs Goetz shot who didn&rsquo;t go on to prey on others was Daryl Cabey, the one he crippled for life.</p>
<p>The last bastion of freedom for Whites left in this country is the jury system.  This is why it is of paramount importance every White learns of their rights as jurors, so that when the day comes, one of us can help the Jerome Erslands (or Bernhard Goetzes, or Scott Kerns) of this world.  Remember: it only takes one person to hang a jury in a criminal trial.</p>

		<p>The pharmacist is a Gulf War I veteran.  I&rsquo;m guessing that what some consider to be excessive force was merely him acting out his military training, when several of Oklahoma City&rsquo;s aspiring rappers decided to wage war on him.</p>
<p>Like I said before, there was only $100,000 bond levied for a Murder 1st charge.  Usually those charged with Murder 1st don&rsquo;t get bail, and if so you can bet on 7 figures.  100 Grand is insanely low for Murder 1st.  Therefore, this is all perfunctory.  I think the DA will drop the charges after the noise draws down, but if not, I hardly think you can get 12/12 people in Oklahoma County, Okla. to convict him.  He might want a change of venue, to try for a redder county in the state (they were all red in 2008), but Oklahoma County&rsquo;s whites are conservative AND have experience with diverse aspiring rappers.</p>
<p>The D.A. would have to prove that the victim was still living before the shots he considered excessive, and prove that he wouldn&rsquo;t have died as a result of those injuries.</p>

The reason the pharmacist is being charged is because after the initial robbery, and probably justified use of self defense, one of the suspects was still in the store unconscious. At the very least the pharmacist probably wasn&rsquo;t obligated to keep this fellow alive and could have simply let him &ldquo;bled out&rdquo;.<br>
Instead he finished him off an unconscious individual with five rounds. Granted I think the world is probably a better place because of what the defendant did but I still think its murder. He deliberately went back and sought out someone did not pose a threat (the assailant was unconscious)and pit five rounds into.<br>
To me that&rsquo;s a deliberate pre meditated action.<br>
I can&rsquo;t say whether or not I would vote to convict him on a jury but I have no doubt if I were D.A. I would certainly file charges. Shooting unconscious people, no matter how reprehensible they may be, is unacceptable for police officiers and certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be accepted behaviour for the general public.Gustav wrote at 8:21 PM on June 1:<br>

Self defense teaching requires you keep shooting until the threat is neutralize and if he kept shooting because he didn&rsquo;t know, thats the perps fault not Mr Erslands!<br>

Murder, I don&rsquo;t think so.  Neutralizing a threat that might kill you after being shot at, I would have done the same thing.</p>
<p>Does that make me a cold blooded killer too yellow man?</p>

		<p>Jury nullification is essential in this case.  Maybe the prosecutor won&rsquo;t use his perfunctory challenges and get a jury that will acquit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The charge of 1st degree murder makes a conviction almost impossible. And if the US constitution is still in effect, it is illegal to charge the same person twice for the same alleged crime&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess you are unaware of the new federal hate crime statutes which allow exactly this kind of double jeopardy.  If your &#8220;murder&#8221; qualifies as a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, you can be found innocent in a local trial and be retried by the federal government.  </p>

<p>The guy on the ground is a human, probably not a very good one.  He deserves a little more respect than a wild grizzly because he can be reasoned with.  Some people in this world have serious problems and need more &#8220;tough love&#8221; than others and I think being shot after a robbery attempt might have turned this guy&rsquo;s life around.  Of course we&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>Another thing is that the surveillance footage does not show the suspect getting up afterwards.  How can someone possibly be a threat if they can&rsquo;t even stand on their own two feet?</p>
<p>Think about it the defendant deliberately moved towards the suspect.  Self defense is justiable when a threat is present.  However how is an unconscious man on the ground or even a man who doesn&rsquo;t have the power to stand on his own two feet a threat?  </p>
<p>I agree the defendant probably did have it coming, but that was only the case while executing the robbery.  Afterwards I think it any reasonable human being would agree that a man who does not have the power to stand on his own two feet,even if he were moving or conscious is no longer a threat.  The term in boxing is the 10 second count if you can&rsquo;t get up after getting knocked down in 10 seconds you&rsquo;ve lost the match because you can no longer pose a credible threat.  </p>

		<p>The prosecuter is up against it. There is a very good chance that there&rsquo;ll be at least one and very likely several nullifyiers on the jury. This is going to be an interesting case.</p>
<p>Of course, if the man is aquitted, the fedgov will jump in with a civil rights charge against him (double jeopardy). They might even do it if he&rsquo;s convicted. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s how I see it:</p>
<p>1. The perp was shot in the head. It thus seems perfectly reasonable that he was already dead. If this is the case, can the pharmacist be charged with murder? An autopsy seems completely necessary for the purpose solving this case.</p>
<p>2. If it turns out that the perp was not killed by the first shot to the head, then he was, after all, a potential threat. Of course, it will be argued that the perp was unconscious and therefore it was unnecessary to kill him. This is, however, mere conjecture, considering that we will never really know whether or not the perp was actually a threat after only receiving the one shot to the head. (And even if, somehow, the medical examiner could prove that the perp was in a coma after the first shot, and therefore not a threat, the pharmacist&rsquo;s defense is simple: He didn&rsquo;t have the luxury of a medical report on the status of perp.) For the sake of the assurance of safety, why would anyone want to find out that the perp was actually a threat?</p>
<p>Look, the bottom line is that this is a tragic situation for the pharmacist. He was simply acting in a heroic fashion, and now he is on trial for his life. As others have noted, if most clerks were to give this response to robbers, then the number of robberies would decrease.</p>

		<p>ersland should NOT be charged for murder. he was being robbed. after the kid hit the floor the cameras couldn&rsquo;t see anything. ersland was obviously scared for his life. if it was me I would have done the same thing. nobody knows what that kid was going to do. so what he was laying on the floor can they prove he wasn&rsquo;t any harm? no because the cameras didn&rsquo;t show what was going on on the floor. he is a veteran like police they are trained to kill anyone that comes at them. if it was a cop they wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped shooting til their gun was empty. let the man be he did what was right.</p>

		<p>As others have pointed out, Mr. Ersland potentially hurt his case by talking to the police before retaining counsel. </p>
<p>N.B. if you feel compelled to talk to the responding officer:</p>
<p>1) &#8220;Officer, I was in fear for my life&#8221;<br>
2) &#8220;I would like that man arrested&#8221; (pointing to the corpse)<br>
3) &#8220;I would like to speak with my attorney&#8221;</p>
<p>The first establishes frame of mind often a condition for the use of deadly force.  </p>
<p>The second serves to condition the jury when your attorney cross examines the responding officer.  Humans associate bad people with being arrested.</p>

		<p>On reflection, Anonymous 64 is right.  None of the cameras show what the kid on the floor was doing.  Was he reaching for, or still holding his gun?  The doctors may say he was in a coma, but was he reaching out randomly in a way that a non-physician in fear for his life could interpret as reaching for his gun?  That&rsquo;s not sophistry, in the service we were taught not to leave an enemy corpse behind unless we KNEW it was dead.</p>

		<p>Roaming bands of violent armed blacks preying on law abiding citizens have done such horrible crimes so often, they cannot expect all to be passive victims, especially war veterens. When someone goes into a store with a gun, intenting to violate&hellip;ALL BETS ARE OFF! Yes it would be nice if a would be violator gets another chance and turns his life around etc.. but the fact is these thugs get away with allot more than they get caught for,&hellip; they are terrorists that feed on civility and human dignity. The store keeper may have used excessive force but its within his jurisdiction as I see it because of the volitility and unknown factors he was unjustly assaulted with. </p>

		<p>The pharmacist was also likely very frightened and stressed. It all would happened very quickly and in the heat of the moment, was so scared and worked up he wasn&rsquo;t thinking clearly and continued to shoot him.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right, it is another pharmacist. </p>
<p>What happens when law-abiding citizens fear defending themselves because of government retribution is that the government becomes complicit in the crime. </p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t just go into a store (where a person&rsquo;s livelihood is at stake), pull out a gun (which is a lethal weapon), rob, humiliate, threaten to kill (which of course is the only reason the victim hands over their money) and then just expect to say hold on you went too far in your self-defense. Once you CHOOSE to initiate a violent confrontation you MUST accept the consequences of the chain of events that get unleashed.</p>

		<p>Late development:</p>
<p>CofCC.org reports that the very same D.A. that drew the Murder 1st charges also asked a judge to allow Ersland to keep his 2nd Amendment rights while under indictment for this felony.  This show you how serious the D.A. is about these charges.  The judge said no, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the same judge that set a very low 100 Grand Bond for Ersland.</p>
