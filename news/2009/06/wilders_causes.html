<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In November 2008 a Dutch journalist, Joanie de Rijke, was abducted by Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. She was held captive, raped repeatedly, and released after six days for a ransom of 100,000 euros ($137,000). After her ordeal, she acknowledged that her captors &#8220;did horrible things to me,&#8221; but added in several media interviews &#8220;They also respected me,&#8221; and emphasized &#8220;They are not monsters.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a speech in the Dutch Parliament last Thursday, the Dutch opposition leader Geert Wilders referred to Joanie de Rijke&rsquo;s case.<blockquote>&#8220;She was raped, but she was not angry. The journalist who went looking for the Taliban in Afghanistan saw her curiosity end in a cruel ordeal of multiple rape. While this would make others angry or sad, this journalist shows understanding. She says: &#8216;They also respected me.&rsquo; And she was given tea and biscuits.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>&#8220;This story&#8221; Wilders said,<blockquote>&#8220;is a perfect illustration of the moral decline of our elites. They are so blinded by their own ideology that they turn a blind eye to the truth. Rape? Well, I would put this into perspective, says the leftist journalist: the Taliban are not monsters. Our elites prefer to deny reality rather than face it. One would expect: a woman is being raped and finds this unbearable. But this journalist is not angry because the Muslim involved also showed respect. Our elites, whether they are politicians, journalists, judges, subsidy gobblers or civil servants, are totally clueless. Plain common sense has been dumped in order to deny reality. It is not just this raped journalist who is suffering from Stockholm syndrome, but the entire Dutch elite. The only moral reference they have is: do not irritate the Muslims  &mdash;  that is the one thing they will condemn.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Stockholm syndrome is a psychological response sometimes seen in hostages, where the hostage shows signs of loyalty to the hostage-taker, regardless of the danger or risk in which the hostages have been placed.</p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; words caused instant fury on all benches except those of his own party. Parliamentarians and government ministers reacted furiously to his reference to Joanie de Rijke. &#8220;You should be ashamed of yourself,&#8221; Femke Halsema of the far-left Green Left Party yelled. Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, a Christian-Democrat, called Wilders&rsquo; statement &#8220;extremely painful and tasteless.&#8221; The PM said the opposition leader was &#8220;shamefully abusing&#8221; the journalist by turning her &#8220;once again into a victim unable to defend herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dutch media, too, attacked Wilders. &#8220;Everybody is angry with Wilders&#8221; the Amsterdam daily <cite>Het Parool</cite> wrote. Even the conservative weblog <cite>De Dagelijkse Standaard</cite> headlined: &#8220;Geert Wilders insults journalist raped by Taliban.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; remark about the European elites&rsquo; &#8220;Stockholm Syndrome&#8221; seems to have hit a nerve. The Dutch elites  &mdash;  from the left to the right, from the Greens to the Conservatives  &mdash;  tried to distract attention from this by focusing on his alleged &#8220;insult&#8221; of an abused woman.</p>
<p>Before elaborating, let us take a closer look at the Joanie de Rijke case.</p>
<p>Mrs. de Rijke is an attractive 43 year old Dutch free-lance journalist with long blonde hair. Though she is a Dutch citizen, she does not live in the Netherlands but in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern half of neighboring Belgium. Most of the time she writes for <cite>P-Magazine,</cite> a glossy Flemish men&rsquo;s weekly which features pictures of girls in lingerie and skimpy bathing suits, pornographic cartoons, articles about fast cars and political pieces.</p>
<p>Last Fall, de Rijke was traveling in Afghanistan for <cite>P-Magazine.</cite> Dressed in a burka, she tried to get in touch with the Taliban to do a human interest story about them. She managed to contact a group of Taliban fighters who had ambushed and killed ten French soldiers in August. De Rijke arranged an interview with Ghazi Gul, the commander of the group. When she and her interpreter arrived for the interview, however, Gul abducted her. He sent the interpreter back to Kabul with a message for <cite>P-Magazine</cite> demanding a ransom of $2 million for the journalist or he would slit her throat.</p>
<p>The Dutch government refused to pay. So did the Belgian government, although Michael Lescroart, <cite>P-Magazine</cite>&rsquo;s editor, claims that initially the Belgian authorities were willing to pay but later changed their minds because they are &#8220;cowards.&#8221; Lescroart also said that he believed the group which abducted de Rijke were not real Taliban but<blockquote>&#8220;some sort of Taliban &#8216;freelancers,&rsquo; scum who were after money. They did not want the real Taliban to know what they were doing, because the real Taliban do not accept that kind of behavior.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Given <cite>P-Magazine</cite>&rsquo;s anti-Americanism and leftist inclinations Lescroart probably harbors sympathy for the Taliban and finds it hard to accept that the &#8220;good guys&#8221; do evil things.</p>
<p>During her captivity, de Rijke was raped repeatedly by Gul. In her book <cite>In de handen van de Taliban,</cite> which she published last month, she writes that the Taliban commander<blockquote>&#8220;could not control his testosterone. I had the impression that afterwards he regretted what had happened. He knew it was wrong.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>The noble savage even &#8220;invited her to a threesome,&#8221; i.e. to have sex with him and one of his three wives. &#8220;Ghazi was a very religious man. It is all so hypocritical. He was a complete fool,&#8221; she writes.</p>
<p>Because the Dutch and Belgian authorities refused to pay, <cite>P-Magazine</cite> raised 100.000 euros and offered it to Ghazi in return for the journalist&rsquo;s release. The commander accepted. De Rijke was freed after six days in exchange for the money, which, says de Rijke, was transferred to the Taliban with the aid of the Dutch authorities.</p>
<p>Abduction and kidnapping of Dutch and Belgian journalists is very rare. It has only happened once before, in the 1980s, when a Dutch journalist was kept hostage for a while in Lebanon. Lescroart demands that the Dutch and Belgian authorities do more for kidnapped journalists in the future: &#8220;It is intolerable that the life of journalists should depend on the money which their colleagues manage to collect.&#8221;</p>
<p>After her release, Joanie de Rijke, too, criticized the Dutch and Belgian authorities for their refusal to pay ransom. &#8220;The Belgians have done nothing. They said it was a matter for the Dutch. And the Dutch authorities said they never pay ransom. In Afghanistan they know well enough that Western governments pay up after an abduction. Germany, Italy and France have all paid ransoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though de Rijke was angry with the Dutch and Belgian authorities, she told the Dutch media in interviews given after her release that she was not angry with her abductors. &#8220;I do not want to depict the Taliban as monsters. I am not angry with Ghazi Gul. After all, he let me live,&#8221; she said. About the rape ordeal she declared that though the experience had been horrible, she was also shown respect. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not black and white. These things can exist side by side. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m suffering from Stockholm syndrome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of her colleagues, however, tend to disagree. Newspaper columnist Elma Drayer wrote in <cite>Trouw</cite> (14 May) that de Rijke&rsquo;s case was a &#8220;classic example of Stockholm syndrome  &mdash;  the phenomenon in which the victims afterwards tell us that the culprits had noble motives and could not help doing what they did.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his speech in parliament last week, Geert Wilders argued that the entire Dutch elite is suffering from Stockholm syndrome and behaves in a fashion similar to Joanie de Rijke. Rather than trying to refute Wilders, the Dutch establishment attacked him, accusing him of &#8220;immorally abusing de Rijke&rsquo;s ordeal for his own political goals.&#8221; De Rijke, too, said she was appalled at Wilders&rsquo; statement. &#8220;I did feel angry because of the rape,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;what I tried to make clear was that the acts of the Taliban cannot be reduced to rape. The fact that I wanted to stress that aspect of my feelings is not the same as the Stockholm syndrome people like Wilders like to talk about. In a war situation people seem only able to think in black and white. I wanted to refine the story. A person is not a monster because he calls himself Taliban.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her reaction confirms precisely what Wilders was trying to say. In reality the Taliban are not monsters because they call themselves Taliban, but because they behave like monsters. People like de Rijke, however, no longer judge people by their behavior and their actions, but condone them for the noble motives which they imagine have driven them to commit their acts. As Wilders said, &#8220;They are so blinded by their own ideology that they turn a blind eye to the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>This attitude led Joanie de Rijke to travel to Afghanistan in the first place, with the aim of interviewing Taliban terrorists who had killed ten French soldiers. This attitude leads her editor to question whether the Taliban who abducted and raped de Rijke are &#8220;real Taliban&#8221; because &#8220;real Taliban do not behave that way.&#8221; This attitude recently led an American woman in Bakersfield, California, to approach a man lurking in the parking lot where she had parked her car because, as she told the police, though the man looked like a thug <a href="/news/2009/04/bakersfield_pol.html" target="Rosedale" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>she did not want to appear racist.</b></a> The man held her at gunpoint, threatening to kill her 11 month old daughter, and robbed and raped her. This attitude has led Western Europe to open its doors to large scale immigration from Muslim countries. This attitude, and here Wilders does not take the argument far enough, is worse than the Stockholm syndrome.</p>
<p>Those who have been abducted and suffer from Stockholm syndrome usually have not placed themselves in danger willingly. They had the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The phenomenon illustrated by the case of Joanie de Rijke is that of people who for ideological reasons deny the existence of danger and subsequently put themselves in danger. Unlike ordinary Stockholm syndrome sufferers they do not begin to shown signs of loyalty to the criminal while in captivity, but have already surrendered to the criminal before their captivity, and, indeed, have ended up in captivity as a consequence of their ideological blindness.</p>
<p>And so, in a way Joanie de Rijke is right. She did not develop Stockholm syndrome while in captivity. She had the syndrome even before she left for Afghanistan. It is natural that she should resent her state of mind being described as Stockholm syndrome, because she considers it to be the state of mind of a righteous and intelligent modern intellectual. It is the state of mind which she shares with almost the entire political and intellectual class of Europe today, that of the hostage to political correctness.</p>

		<p>This might sound crazy and I am not trying to be funny or get anyone mad, but it is possible she enjoyed being raped. Some men and women have sick sexual fantasies and enjoying having sex with multiple men is not beyong the realm of enjoyment for a woman who is a sexual degenerate.</p>

		<p>Excellent and disturbing article.  My opinion of Mr. Wilders just went up another notch.  The extent to which whites have become brainwashed by multiculturalism is astonishing.  I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that people don&rsquo;t talk to each other anymore.  The average American comes home, turns on the t.v., and sits all evening.  Sadly, for many, the images presented by the media and entertainment industry are more real than actual reality.<br>
I used to think that one day their would be a great awakening of whites in this country due to black crime and violence.  I figured that, at the rate we are going, within the decade most whites in America will have had a family member who was the victim of a violent crime commited by a black criminal or be a victim themselves.  However, I&rsquo;m afraid that most whites who are victimized by blacks will just convince themselves that the crime was an aberation and that what they see on t.v. is real.</p>

		<p>What is most disturbing about this story, is not what Mr. Wilders has said (after all, what do you expect from a Nazi) but how apparently educated and insightful people, from Ms. de Rijke straight through to Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, actually have the nerve to call this a rape.</p>
<p>This is clearly a case of Sexually Transmitted Cultural Enrichment!</p>
<p>Any who would say otherwise, needs sensitivity training or even possibly institutionalized psychiatric treatment; end of discussion!!!<br>

		<p>Brilliant article. Finally a European conservative exposes the liberal elite for what they truly are. Liberalism is a mental illness, when people start justifying their rape, their displacemant, their suicide as morally just, it is the only way to describe these people.</p>

		<p>Maybe she enjoyed the rapes.</p>
<p>Could be a bit of a fetish for her.</p>
<p>Maybe she will go back for more.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure that she is mentally incompetent, for what reason I do not know, perhaps brainwashing.</p>

<p>No, if someone rapes you, they do not respect you and they are monsters. They are committing the 2nd worst offence on you, the first being murder. This woman is so utterly brainwashed and out of touch with reality, it&rsquo;s sad really.</p>

		<p>actually, this suggests a great way to rebuild the wartorn Afghan economy - import blonde hookers from the Netherlands and then demand &#8220;ransom&#8221; for them. The hooker gets $10K, the local gang gets $100K, and the Dutch government or journalist association or whoever get to save the day. Everybody is happy. Along the way, it will be conclusively proven that all is not black and white, and that the hookers were treated with respect :)</p>

		<p>Jan Peter has proved Wilder&rsquo;s point by comparing his insensitive statements to the rape itself. People like him have lost all ability to think. If you are a Christian, you are pure evil. If you are the Taliban, you can do no wrong. Let&rsquo;s not let facts get in the way.</p>

		<p>I am apalled at this insensitivity toward the Taliban commander. The people involved in this farcical personal attack on these freedom fighters ought to be required to attend a three-month block of sensitivity training; after all, he was just doing what cums naturally to any man. An uplifting documentary needs to be made in oder to defuse this intolerable set of citcumsisions.</p>

<p>Stockholm Syndrome?</p>
<p>Nonsense!</p>
<p>These people are mentally disturbed and are too incompetent to be in positions where they effect other people&rsquo;s lives.  They are the ones that should be culled from our race if we ever get into a position where we can choose who we want to live with.  They&rsquo;re too mentally disabled to offer anything of value, including sanity.</p>

Liberalism is a kind of mental illness characterized by an inability to see reality.</p>
<p>I see variations of this in my own neighborhood as more minorities move in and graffiti, drug busts, home invasions (one just happened on my street within the last 2 weeks), and armed robberies (with semi-automatic weapons) keep making the local news.</p>
<p>I bring it up with people and all they can say is that it&rsquo;s only a few troublemakers.<br>

		<p>  &#8220;She was traveling in Afghanistan for P-Magazine, a glossy Flemish men&rsquo;s weekly which features pictures of girls in lingerie and skimpy bathing suits, pornographic cartoons, articles about fast cars and political pieces.   Dressed in a burka, she tried to get in touch with the Taliban to do a human interest story about them.  <br>
She managed to contact a group of Taliban fighters who had ambushed and killed ten French soldiers.  Given P-Magazine&rsquo;s anti-Americanism and leftist inclinations Lescroart probably harbors sympathy for the Taliban.&#8221;       <i> [nice crowd! ]    </i><br>

<p>Wait a minute!

<p>Bizarre!!    She got what she was asking for.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put some pieces together here.  On further thought, I&rsquo;ll add that she lives in Flemish Belgium (many Moslems there!) and  I&rsquo;ll betcha that anti-American, pro-Taliban  porno mag is read by mostly leering Arab types and that&rsquo;s the audience she&rsquo;s catering to back home.    Mustn&rsquo;t offend the Moslems!  </p>

Excellent article, thanks for posting. Yes, &#8220;Pre-Captivity Stockholm Syndrome&#8221; describes the Euro elites&rsquo; mentality very well. What the Eurabian left preaches is, essentially, voluntary dhimmitude. Cultural suicide on a continental scale. An auto-holocaust of Christians and Caucasians. </p>

		<p>lol  they are upset at Wilders, and not the Taliban. Sounds&hellip; so like the atmosphere here in the USA. They&rsquo;re not upset about any amount of black crime, affecting non-blacks, but they do get very upset if someone simply reports the facts of black crime, for starters.</p>
<p>By jumping on Wilders instead of the &#8216;criminals&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve simply proven Wilder&rsquo;s point? But no one other than Thomas Landen notices even the irony.</p>

		<p>I would love to hear this obviously deluded(and probably mentally ill)woman explain how she can have such tender feelings for her rapists - the same rapists who condemn and brutalize their own women for any perceived &#8220;moral&#8221; infraction and demand that they go about with glorified window draperies bound around their heads and bodies! </p>

		<p>&#8220;People like de Rijke, however, no longer judge people by their behavior and their actions, but condone them for the noble motives which they imagine have driven them to commit their acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not completely true. Not at all. They have no problem judging someone with a less &#8216;exotic&rsquo; record. A sexual harasser, or convicted sex-offender for example. Or even someone who just plain doesn&rsquo;t support leftist &#8216;ideals&rsquo; properly.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;did horrible things to me,&rdquo; but &#8220;They also respected me.&#8221; Wait a minute&hellip;.something smells fishy here. This really sounds like some unbalanced woman&rsquo;s rape fantasy after reading too many romance novels. I don&rsquo;t think this is merely the Stockholm Syndrome, I think it could very possibly be a complete fabrication in order to sell a book. The magazine she writes for should give a clue as to her personality. She looks like a &#8220;bottle blond&#8221;, too. Her whole story sounds crazy from start to finish, just like other phony stories that we&rsquo;ve all been assailed with by the media: The woman and her kid that just recently went AWOL and ended up in Disneyworld, Jessica Lynch, Susan Smith, Tawana Brawley, that woman in Texas (?) a few years back that slit her own throat and killed her boys and blamed it on an &#8220;intruder&#8221;. Some women are disturbingly good at making up elaborate stories about some personal tragedy. Lest you think I&rsquo;m just some unsympathetic male, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m female, and I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that some women lie. I could be wrong, and if she really was raped, I&rsquo;ll apologize right here and now. But somehow, I doubt it.    </p>

		<p>I won&rsquo;t go so far as to say she enjoy being raped, but I think maybe this wasn&rsquo;t even perceived by her as a true rape, but rather a sort of overly coerced sexual encounter for someone who is probably more than used to sleeping around with men of all races.  It was probably no big deal, is the way I would put it.  It was not like certain other rapes in the news, on a scale of victimhood.  Or so it seems.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how feminists in the West make a big production out of rape. But this case has pretty much gone under the radar screen. This is not about what happened in Afghanistan.

		<p>&#8220;After her release, Joanie de Rijke, too, criticized the Dutch and Belgian authorities for their refusal to pay ransom. &ldquo;The Belgians have done nothing. They said it was a matter for the Dutch. And the Dutch authorities said they never pay ransom. In Afghanistan they know well enough that Western governments pay up after an abduction. Germany, Italy and France have all paid ransoms.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hello&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>A stupid liberal woman takes herself into the most dangerous part of the world and mixes with a bunch of women hating islamists and then expects her government to hand over taxpayers hard earnt money to get her out again.</p>
<p>She deserves everthing that happened to her - her rationalising it after the event doesn&rsquo;t fool anyone.</p>
<p>That anyone paid a ransom for her is hard to understand.</p>

How generous of them!  For those Americans who may not know, &#8220;biscuits&#8221; is the European term for what we call crackers.   In other words, they were feeding her crackers!    Wow. They sure took good care of her!   How kind.  No wonder she&rsquo;s grateful. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been researching lately stories of white children who were captured and raised by Indians.  There were many such cases.  Usually their families were all murdered and scalped, except them. And usually, these captives who were kept were girls.  They were doubtless sexually abused, at first, in unspeakable ways, and when older were married to Indian husbands and had half-Indian children.   Very commonly, they refused in later life to return to the white world when given a chance, but preferred to remain among the Indians for the rest of their lives.   They were loyal to the Indians who had captured them, raped them, and had killed their families.  In other words, this is an old story; it has been going on for a long time. Only the name, &#8220;Stockholm Syndrome&#8221;, is new. </p>

		<p>This item puzzles me. Rijke knew the risks she was taking. It is known to one and all that spies often pose as newsers, and newsers are often suspected of being spies. She is right in that she is fortunate to have survived, and only suffered some raping. I can empathize with and even respect her showing an attitude of acceptance. The puzzling part is that after her ordeal, she sympathizes with her attackers, and villifies the Liberal governments for not setting the distuctive precedent of paying her ransom.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with Wilders&rsquo; view either. This was not a case of a woman abducted and assaulted in her homeland. It was a woman who for her own benefit, knowingly went to a dangerous part of Afghanistan and dealt with dangerous people. I don&rsquo;t see how this is an example of Stockholm syndrome. There is no law or &#8220;human rights&#8221; where she voluntarily went. She was not an innocent victim of captivity, who identifies with the criminals who captured her; she was an adventurer who got into a deadly situation. </p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t believe that the Dutch or Belgian governments were responsible for her welfare in Afghanistan; they are not always able to protect people in Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>

		<p>There comes a point when a society is so soft it is easily conquered by ruthless barbarians.  It happened to the ancient Romans and is now happening to the Western countries collectively.  </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t overly intellectualize everything.  Some things are primal.  In the animal world creatures fight over expanding their turf, getting the best mates, and access to food, water and shelter.  In the human world there are people who would love to expand their country&rsquo;s territory (see Mexico&rsquo;s intrusion into California and Texas), or use another country&rsquo;s pretty women, or enjoy free social services, especially when the services are bankrolled by an unaware, suicidal, &#8220;other&#8221; race.</p>
<p>The first duty of a good politician is to protect his beloved country from enemies, invasion and ethnic cleansing.  Geert Wilders is a politician who cares about his people, his extended family.  Is that a crime?  Oh, wait, only for White people!</p>

		<p>One reason I have so little respect for psychologists is that they do not, as a rule, recognize liberalism as a mental illness.  My definition of a healthy society is one that sustains and reproduces itself.  Liberal society wishes only to destroy itself, starting with the White working class.  <br>
     Once, at my wife&rsquo;s insistence, I went to see a psychiatrist.  Surprisingly, when I told her how I had come to detest my own society, that it had changed into something contemptible, she said that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with me.  So, they&rsquo;re not all bad, but if the majority of them were actually healers instead of secret policemen at heart, the professional journals ought be filled with articles about &#8220;White Liberal Syndrome&#8221;.  </p>

As an ultra conservative I was against both wars, we have every right to be there as we were attacked but I question the wisdom of it .I do not believe a Muslim nation can change, Islam is the antithesis of liberty and they cannot coexist for long on the same piece of ground . I also believe 9-11 could not have happened without the Immigration Bill of &#8216;65 happening first . And a just war or not, the bill is sent to the taxpayer . Conceding my working class laymen&rsquo;s view may be simplistic,if it had all been up to me after 9-11 I would have first cut off all foreign aid to any Muslim nation . All Muslims in the U.S. would have been sent packing regardless of how long here,Excepting of course Nation of Islam, whom I would have put under extreme scrutiny with a stern warning . The ACLU ? Stop all tax exemptions and tax moneys going to them . Put the troops on the borders, shut down all non-European immigration . Rebuild the WTC and take the money we save by not going to war to research fusion and super conductivity, we must have them . We should be using our fossil fuels to produce synthetics . When you realize how much coal a 4000 megawatt plant burns in an hour, it&rsquo;s just a waste . I believe this is how we should handle the Muslim world .Please do not take this as support for the liberal democrats, Key West will be a 100 ft deep in a glacier before they ever get my vote .</p>

<p>I see your point, but I also see a major difference. In those cases, the hostages were children, and whatever horrible things might have been done to them, the fact remains that they were suddenly dependent on those Indians for their survival in a harsh and unforgiving wilderness. By the time they are grown, they&rsquo;ve lived their whole lives knowing no other way.</p>
