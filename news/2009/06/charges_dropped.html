<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31112595/">Charges Dropped in Black Man&rsquo;s Dragging Death</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shannon Finley and Charles Crostley were released Thursday afternoon in Paris, in east Texas, after a judge granted the special prosecutor&rsquo;s motion to dismiss the case. The two men had been charged with fatally striking 24-year-old Brandon McClelland with a pickup truck in September following a late-night beer run the three friends had made to the neighboring state of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The case had been unraveling in recent months because of a lack of eyewitnesses and physical evidence. Last month, a gravel truck driver gave a sworn statement acknowledging he might have accidentally run over McClelland.</p>
<p>&#8220;After investigation, it has been determined this case should be dismissed in the interests of justice,&#8221; special prosecutor Toby Shook said. &#8220;The decision is about the state of the evidence in the case as it exists today.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Investigation to continue</b></p>
<p>Shook said the investigation will continue. The gravel truck driver is unlikely to face charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s very simple,&#8221; said David Turner, Crostley&rsquo;s lawyer. &#8220;These fellows didn&rsquo;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finley and Crostley had been unable to post their bonds and had remained in jail since being arrested last year.</p>
<p>Authorities have said Finley, Crostley and McClelland were friends who drove across the Oklahoma state line for beer in September. They argued on the way back about whether Finley was too drunk to drive, and McClelland got out of the car to walk home.</p>
<p>Authorities had alleged that Finley then ran down McClelland, whose body was caught under the truck and dragged about 70 feet (20 meters). His mangled body was found along a country road.</p>
<p>The racial implications of the case reminded some of the murder of James Byrd, who was chained by the ankles to the bumper of a pickup truck and dragged to death in 1998 in the east Texas town of Jasper. Three white men were convicted of killing him; two are on death row and the other is serving a life term.</p>
<p>McClelland&rsquo;s death brought out protesters from the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party. A rally last year also attracted at least one acknowledged member of the Ku Klux Klan to Paris, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northeast of Dallas.<br>

		<p>Amazing.  Now all they have to do is abolish all the affirmative action quotas that allow every group under the sun to take jobs away from more qualified Whites.  All the media has to do is get rid of its terrible prejudice and double standards for White people.  All Blacks have to do is stop destroying neighborhoods, stop robbing, raping, and killing White people.  All we have to do is close the borders and deport all the illegal aliens.  All we have to do is fight the Amero and the North American Union, etc. <br>
All White people have to do is wake the heck up and fight back and we&rsquo;re in business.</p>

		<p>It is still instructive to remind readers that the &#8216;Jasper <br>
Dragging Death&rsquo;@ was a media, Leftist, and minority concocted tale of what supposedly happened rather than what actually happened.  True, the man was dragged to death by the other three criminals.  However, he was NOT dragged because of &#8216;White Racism&rsquo; as the professional triad of liars above claim, but was killed as a result of a drug deal gone bad.  The Sheriff who first was on the case stated in public that there was &#8220;NO RACIAL INTENT&#8221; in the killings. All four men, including the victim, had been in prison together at one time and they all knew each other.  The Sheriff surmised that the killing was the result of an argument the four had over a possibly botched drug deal.  However, the professional victims and their lap-dogs not only twisted the story to fit their eternal &#8216;White = Evil&rsquo; agenda but bullied the Sheriff into modifying his original story, basically backing down from his initial claim of no racial intent.</p>

<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t matter, didn&rsquo;t you know that any poor innocent black killed even remotely NEAR an evil white person will be deemed a vicious HATE crime, while any poor black person killing a white person, well, if its not completely justified, then it certainly could NEVER be racially involved?  c&rsquo;mon, get with it!</p>

		<p>I honestly fear being in a car accident with a black person, not just because he might get out and kill me - that&rsquo;s a possibility any time - but because I know that racial animus as a motive will always be looked into when a black is injured or killed in the vicinity of a white. </p>

		<p>Making this case about race is not only unjust, it cheapens the death of Brandon McClelland. I wonder why the Gravel truck driver is not facing charges. Don&rsquo;t you normally face charges if you run someone over and they die?</p>

<p>Not necessarily. Several years ago a co-worker was on his way to a plant in the early hours of the morning.  He was a maintenance tech and was on call that night,and when the normal shift personnel needed some help with a problem,he got to get out of bed at 1:30 in the morning and head for work.</p>
<p>As it happened,a very bad thunderstorm had passed through a little while before my co-worker got moving. By the time he reached the exit to the plant,the rain had stopped,but there was still a lot of water in the ditches,and the creeks were full.</p>
<p>Then a really horrible thing happened-he came around a curve,and hit a pedestrian,who was later pronounced dead at the scene. As reconstructed,the pedestrian was some poor devil whose car had broken down (flat tire,maybe? I don&rsquo;t remember the details) and was walking down the access road,almost certainly to get some sort of help. And this guy had walked out into the middle of the access road,apparently to avoid a huge pool of standing water just as my co-worker came around a curve. Murphy was working overtime that night.</p>
<p>But there was no criminal intent,no one was drunk or under the influence of any drugs,and no one was even breaking the speed limit. It was a very terrible accident,but an accident is exactly what it was,and no charges were filed.</p>

		<p>     Too bad a professional hoaxer like  Rev Al wasn&rsquo;t around. With the dishonest compliant media at his side, the Rev could have had those boys on death row.Don&rsquo;t underestimate the skills of a good hoaxer. ( of course, with the phony media behind &#8216;em)</p>
