<h1>Holocaust Shooting Signals Race Turmoil, Some Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, AP, June 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Crazies. Lone nut jobs. Isolated loonies. Those are frequent descriptions of people like James von Brunn, the 88-year-old white supremacist accused of opening fire at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and killing a black guard.</p>
<p>Others believe he represents something more dangerous: a growing racist movement motivated by a number of converging factors, including the first black president.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The movement has broadened beyond neo-Nazis. Advocacy groups for blacks and Hispanics unwittingly provided a blueprint for others to organize and defend the interests of white people.</p>
<p>Louis R. Andrews is chairman of the National Policy Institute, a white advocacy group. He does not advocate violence, but expects to see increased racial animosity that will eventually manifest itself in more physical attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no such thing as post-racial,&#8221; Andrews said, when asked about the claim that Obama&rsquo;s election moved American race relations to a better place. &#8220;There&rsquo;s conflict, conflict, and continued conflict.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrews said he voted for Obama because &#8220;I want to see the Republican Party destroyed, so it can be reborn as a party representing the interests of white people, and not entrenched corporate elites.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When you go to the NPI&rsquo;s home page, you will notice a quote in the northwest corner that reads that the &#8220;Augusta, Ga. based think tank is the right&rsquo;s answer to the SPLC.&#8221;  I am proud to have been the source of that quote, which I made in my own blog when I first learned of the NPI.  And it&rsquo;s literally my opinion, we need our SPLCs and ADLs.  If the NPI has any shortcomings, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s not willing to be Machiavellian in their vitriol and borderline slander of the left wing, which is what the SPLC/ADL have no qualms in doing.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I got an e-mail this morning from a man in Chicago, who e-mailed me on the &#8220;contact me&#8221; page on my blog.  He was watching a local morning news show in Chicago, he didn&rsquo;t say which channel.  They had a story about Von Brunn&rsquo;s son in Florida bashing his father for his &#8220;white supremacism&#8221; (btw, that&rsquo;s another bone to pick, there is a difference between right wing anti-Semitism and white supremacism, they are two different viewpoints that do not exclusively overlap), and the son talked about how evil his father was for thinking that blacks were inferior.  After that, the next five stories in a row were about either crimes that happened overnight in what the e-mailer said were obviously black neighborhoods, or showing black men who have been charged with earlier crimes.</p>

<p>- You know whats funny? They said the same thing about William Ayers back in the 60&rsquo;s, only Ayers commited his violence and bombings in the name of the left. And just a paltry forty years transpires and now he has the ear of the president of the United States. My how times have changed. To borrow from John PM&hellip;God help us.</p>

<p>Yes, and that&rsquo;s the direction all multicultural societies go, especially if they&rsquo;re as this one, awarding undue favoritism to non-whites at the expense of whites, while trying to maintain its empire.</p>
<p>The acceleration of racial hostilities is being prompted into a little faster mode because of the quickly declining economy, which is losing more than a half million jobs every month.</p>
<p>Black unemployment is now at 15%, not counting those who have quit looking for work, which will increase that unemployment figure to around 20% if those people are included, with the true overall national percentage at about 15%.  What is the June jobless rate going to be?  </p>
<p>This 15-20% is the line of demarcation that divides peace from riots.    Add to that, local tax increases to try to compensate for plummeting state budgets and other tax increases by the federal government, and we could be set to erupt into a super hot summer; however, my belief is that it&rsquo;s going to get dicy about October of this year, but won&rsquo;t evolve into a near riot situation until the first of next year, which will make the Summer of 2010 the hottest one on record.  Anything could break out then.  We could, however, have many small skirmishes as a prelude to more serious violence.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t we just read several articles outlining the racial violence in California between blacks and mestizos?  That situation always has the potential to precede any other action in the US, because California is in the worst shape of all the other states, and it is VERY close to total collapse.  However, even saving it from collapse will still mean the situation there is critical and that societal conditions will hardly improve.  And what about the coming fiscal year, with revenues continuing to fall? </p>

		<p>A multiracial society is always a sick society. This country was built and maintained by Whites and now they are demonizing those who want their country back from the loonie lefties and nonwhites? We are White, so we are all &#8220;terrorists&#8221; now and have to be watched and tracked and locked up. This is all about silencing any outcry from Whites who defend their own, which aren&rsquo;t very many, sad to say. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a book lately, &#8220;Civil Wars: From L.A. to Bosnia&#8221;, by a German, Hans Magnus Enzenberger.  (1994)  He holds that we are encountering an &#8220;autism of violence, a tendency toward self destruction and collective madness&#8221;, and ties a lot of violent cultural phenomena together.  He has a lot to say about immigration too.  It&rsquo;s not easy reading, but it&rsquo;s only 144 pages.  </p>
<p>Personally, while the suffering of children still disturbs me, I find that my first response to any tragedy or atrocity is to ask who the victims or perpetrators are.  Were my people harmed?  Did one of my people do wrong and will we all be blamed once again?  I didn&rsquo;t always react that way, but I&rsquo;ve come to feel like a citizen of a defeated, occupied nation.  The needs of survival crowd out ordinary compassion for outlanders.  </p>

<p>No, wait! This kind of stuff is ONLY meant for People of Color. Who told these whites they could stop being color blind?</p>
<p>&#8220;Swain argues that many people with &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; views don&rsquo;t fit the extremist stereotype  &mdash;  they are professors, scientists, elected officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;What drives a person to the point where they hate someone?&#8221; she asked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good question, Carol. Why don&rsquo;t you ask some of your friends at those black and hispanic organizations who&rsquo;s ideas we stole and are now using improperly?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s almost as if there is some sort of silent signal, a signal that it&rsquo;s OK, this is necessary, it must be done,&#8221;. </p>
<p>Not so silent, Dr. Berlinerblau, as anyone who&rsquo;s had to endure a hindu wedding or just about any mindless third-world celebration in their once quiet neighborhood. Gunfire kind of draws attention to itself, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people can be &#8220;pushed over the edge&#8221; by stresses such as the loss of a job or another traumatic event, said psychologist David Eigen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men aren&rsquo;t supposed to feel powerless or helpless,&#8221; Eigen said. &#8220;When a man starts to feel that, he feels angry and ashamed inside, and he can project it outward. For hundreds of years, Jews have been a convenient target. So let&rsquo;s blame the Jews.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
By all means, let&rsquo;s get clinical about it. Then we can diagnose it properly and get these people treatment, away from the multicult paradise they so fear. After all, it&rsquo;s entirely irrational to look for the cause of the deterioration of one&rsquo;s society in the hostility of others actively seeking to undermine it, when everyone knows that these things are inevitable, like the rolling in and out of the tides. Why, the Hart-Cellar act was just like finding a shiny new seashell on the shores of a bright future. </p>
<p>No kidding, I don&rsquo;t know whether we are winning or losing, but these people are starting to notice and get scared and that makes me smile. What surprises me, at least just a bit, is that they still go to their old playbook, and I think it&rsquo;s convincing fewer and fewer whites. </p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s something festering in society today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A boil has been broken. We want to put a Band-Aid on it, but it&rsquo;s too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying the optimism of this statement. What?&hellip; Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry! Did he not mean it that way?</p>

		<p>As an aside on the HM shootings, I tend to think the official story isn&rsquo;t the entire story.  Not that I have any proof, but things I&rsquo;m reading, especially in the British papers about this, makes me sense provocation here, especially on the part of a three-letter Federal law enforcement agency.</p>

<p>Yes, many of us noticed that, and Oreilly and Glen Beck gave the contrast plenty of play, as did some radio talk show hosts.</p>
<p>But, let me just point out one thing about this museum shooter.  Good lord, the man is 88 years old.  Surely he can&rsquo;t be in his right mind.</p>
<p>If this were a leftist shooting a right winger all we&rsquo;d hear from the media is that the guy was incapacitated because of his age, and they would bring out witnesses who would say how he was in the early or middle stages of dementia, and/or that he wasn&rsquo;t able to get around too well due to his lack of natural agility due to his age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of these manipulating yellow journalists I could vomit.</p>
<p>And this black Muslim bragged about the murder he committed and said he was glad to have committed it.  If it had been the old 88 year old guy saying that it would have been played and replayed for hourse every day, but only those of us who watch Fox News saw a clip of those despicable statements.<br>

I was watching CNN and in passing, they identified the dead guard as African American.</p>
<p>Again we see that while race isn&rsquo;t supposed to matter when the perpetrator is black, race is critical when it puts blacks in a positive light.</p>
<p>Had the guard been white, I certainly don&rsquo;t believe that anyone at any time would have identified the guard as white. While they may have shown a photograph of the guard, STATING the guard as white would have been irrelevant. Since he was black, it became critical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry anyone had to die like this but I have ask why the media is making his race an issue?</p>
<p>As for the motives of Mr. von Brunn, while he was an extremist, one has to ask why was he an extremist?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of a quote by JFK: &#8220;Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable&#8221;.</p>
<p>While Mr. von Brunn was frustrated and angry, so too are white nationlist whose opinions are dismissed out of hand. If we are going to have our right of free conscience taken from us, it&rsquo;s likely others will follow Mr. Von Brunns&rsquo; example.</p>
<p>If people really want to prevent these kinds of events, people must be able to speak their minds regardless of who doesn&rsquo;t like it.<br>

<p>&gt; No it isn&rsquo;t - it is hurting the White cause.  Everytime some extremist succeeds in identifying Whites who wish to see their own race preserved and their own cultures respected with Nazis and other polarizing issues like this idiot who claims history - recent history blazing with undeniable facts and living witnesses - didn&rsquo;t happen, and then attacks a memorial/museum of that grisly epic of mass murder absence of reason, he draws out those who with their own words, will make the possibility of a political success a guaranteed failure.</p>
<p>As for Whites wanting a race war, talk is talk.  I don&rsquo;t see very many of these guys looking in good physical shape, ready to actually get off their couches and from behind their computers to actually do something.  There may be a civil war when things really start to fall apart, and I predict they will sooner than we would like.  But Whites still far out number Blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t care for Blacks either, nor do Asians.  So Blacks would probably be the first group eliminated.  But this is really non-sense.  Many people will groups according to where they live and against anyone who attacks their neighborhood.  At least as far as I am concerned, I will shoot at anyone who violates my property or my or my loved ones and allies against anyone of any race, creed or religion.  I am an equal opportunity home defender.</p>

<p>I think it is your bias that is blatant.  The Black Muslim who shot the soldiers did got plenty of coverage, I saw it for several days with a follow up a few days later.  There was a Black Muslim who attacked a Synagogue a couple weeks earlier and he got about the same or less coverage than the military recruiting post shooting.  What you seem to be willfully ignoring, like a great many posters here, is the implication of this particular attack and the person who did it.  See, while some Muslims have attacked our country - 9/11, etc., and we have fought with them in their own countries and got killed doing it, the German Nazis in WW2 took over Europe and made it clear that they were aiming at world domination.  They got over 50 million people killed in WW2.  Six million of the non-combatants who were killed were killed in a systematic manner that was so evil and inhumane that most people of conscious react normally with disgust and horror when something like this happens.  AR posters have a chance here to show some intelligence and the kind of moderation that Nick Griffith and the BNP has been obligated to cultivate in order to appeal to anyone but neo-Nazis.  If the White movement cannot mature beyond this it has no future.  And it probably doesn&rsquo;t deserve one.</p>

		<p>James von Brunn is a convicted felon and could not have legally bought the rifle he used to commit this crime.  This one of countless examples of the saying &#8220;When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.&#8221; </p>
<p>In other words, gun control does not work because criminals can simply buy guns illegally and still menace society.  </p>
<p>To everyone reading this post, I have heard there is more crime in Great Britain where guns are banned, than in Switzerland where gun ownership is mandatory.  I do know gun crimes happen in Great Britain and unarmed police, called &#8220;bobbies&#8221; get shot at.</p>
<p>The idiots who want to ban firearm ownership just don&rsquo;t get it!</p>

		<p>  One lone, senile idiot tries to commit suicide by policemen and the media acts like a monumental conspiracy has been uncovered. Von Brunn was a psychological misfit. He tried to kidnap the members of the FED! Now everyone who opposes the FED is a racist? The media never misses an opportunity to paint all their critics with the same tar brush. Why should the First Amendment be chucked because of some murderous fool? I feel safer when individuals are allowed to freely express their opinions  &mdash;  no matter how ridiculous, stupid or controversial.</p>

		<p>Something inside me can&rsquo;t help but be suspicious about this shooting.  It seems too perfect of a time line.  Democrats are desperately trying to push the hate bell through, and now with this shooting, the MSM has the ammunition (no pun intended) to try to rally the public to back another loss of freedom.</p>
<p>Just another step toward the Soviet States of America.</p>

<p>I understand where you are comming from. However, I am comming across more and more White Guys who know they are being singled out for being White and mMle. I just came across another one this morning at the deli. He was complaining about reverse discrimination. This was one of the delivery guys. An exponetial growth in White Conciousness will occur when the catastrophes hit unrelentingly-with no breathing space. When this happens,mass deportation of post-1965 nonwhites will be a real possibility.</p>

		<p>Even though we are now a multiethnic society and are headed for the equivalent of whitewater rapids, let&rsquo;s not flip the kayak. The best way to deal with the adversary is through constant pressure for equity in race matters. I like the course Geert Wilders took: political organization, party - building, victory.<br>
Also, I like his rejection of monotheism - he is now an atheist with a Christian background. Presumably he found monotheism to be an incoherent concept, and a liability in the ongoing cultural debate with Islamists. Bringing &#8220;God&#8221; down to earth and crediting the human imagination with his creation makes dealing with fanatic believers much easier; you don&rsquo;t have to process their claims to divine origin and justification. They are simply violent and dangerous people; no dialogue is needed. In fact, any accomodation with them because of a presumed common Abrahamic heritage cannot be countenanced.<br>
This doesn&rsquo;t mean the Bible or other ancient literary inheritances should not be honored or read. Maybe they should be; in doing so the negligible value of the koran as literature can be appreciated.</p>

		<p>You want to see conflict?  Just wait until China stops buying the US Treasury bills that sustain the massive deficit spending that props up the US welfare state.  Blacks and Hispanics are going to freak out when there isn&rsquo;t the money to run the &#8220;gimme&#8221; programs they&rsquo;ve become addicted to and on which so many of them depend for employment.  That&rsquo;s right; they&rsquo;ll have to find real private-sector jobs and live on their own incomes - just like the rest of us do - and they won&rsquo;t like it one bit.</p>

		<p>Expect The Full Monty propaganda blitz from the SPLC, La Raza, NAACP and endless Hollywood movies, TV mini series etc on this incident.</p>
<p>This is just to be expected, there is nothing &#8220;fair&#8221; about this anymore than there is anything fair about Justice Department stats that show there are 30,000 plus Black rapes/sexual assaults against White females each year and between 0-10 White male rapes of Black females etc - and of course there is no MSM coverage of these hate crimes, no planned Hollywood movies about these crimes against our people.</p>
<p>http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cvusst.htm</p>
<p><br>
We simply have to get better at producing and distributing the propaganda (truth is the best propaganda) about the reality of hateful crimes against our people.</p>
<p>I sense that the American public is less likely to fall hook, line and sinker for the anti White hate crimes propaganda than they were say 15 years ago after events like the Duke Lacrosse Team rape hoax.</p>
<p>We are getting better at countering MSM, anti White publicity campaigns. This one event doesn&rsquo;t change anything.<br>

		<p>Carol Swain, Poly Sci prof at Vanderbilt, is mentioned here.  Even though she is left wing aplenty, she&rsquo;s actually very reasonable and not given to invective when writing about the racial right wing.  Too, she&rsquo;s opposed to amnesty and open borders, mainly because its detrimental affects on the black working class.  Sometimes, one of the best gifts is to be able to see yourself through the eyes of intellectually honest members of the other side.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.&rsquo;There&rsquo;s conflict, conflict, and continued conflict.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And from Ranger:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;This 15-20% is the line of demarcation that divides peace from riots&hellip;.We could, however, have many small skirmishes as a prelude to more serious violence&hellip;.California is in the worst shape of all the other states, and it is VERY close to total collapse&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I believe we here in LA got a small taste of things to come the other night when the Lakers won the NBA championship: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Hundreds celebrated in the streets outside Staples Center.. some revelers damaging police cruisers, throwing rocks and bottles at officers and setting bonfires in the street, authorities said&hellip;.Several police cruisers were damaged and reinforcement officers were called in from throughout the city to help disperse the crowd&hellip;Los Angeles police said five officers were hit by debris.</p>
<p>&hellip;.the celebrants broke down the door to the store yelling, &#8216;We want shoes, we want shoes.&rsquo; &hellip;damage to the store&rsquo;s innards is extensive; glass display cases are shattered, two computers, money, and accessories were looted. Torres estimated the damage at nearly $140,000 but expects to be covered by insurance&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>For a photo of the rioters:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/m822vh" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/m822vh</a></p>
<p>As Ranger pointed out, California is on the brink of collapse with large numbers of unemployed, entitlement-raised, feral young non-Whites who are about to have their gravy train cut off.  What have they got to lose, especially against the ham-strung LAPD?  I expect the next riots to make the &#8216;92 Rodney King riot look like a backyard BBQ. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The fact is that man Whites secretly want to start a race war and this is givng them ammuntion to do so&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh Wow!  Another black that KNOWS Whites &#8216;secretly want to start a race war!&rsquo;  Did you figure this out by reading our minds or did you crack our secret White code?</p>
<p>All I have to say is be careful what you wish for, you may get it!!!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you stupid, foolish or both?  Do you really think blacks would win a race war against Whites, hispanics and/or Asians? </p>
<p>If there is anarchy, as I suspect there may be, there will be a viciousness unleashed in Whites as nothing before. </p>
<p>You do not have the group intelligence to organize against Whites, the hispanics have almost completely ethnically cleansed your people from your own historic areas  &mdash;  and they&rsquo;re not about to cede one inch back to you and the Asians, who are prepared, will be on the rooftops, as they were during the Rodney King riots, defending their property and themselves with deadly force.    </p>
<p>The Asians will not hold back and will be merciless to you as they remember how you targeted and destroyed their businesses during the &#8216;92 riots and then received little to no help from the local government while the black community was showered with endless funds to &#8216;rebuild&rsquo; the communities they destroyed.</p>
<p>Yes, I should say to you, be careful what you wish for..You will not win.</p>

<p>I was an intersting experience. Five White guys in the deli and he was a mixture of fear-for expressing it publicly-and &#8220;I&rsquo;m not gonna take it anymore&#8221;. I told him that it was not reverse. discrimnation but just racial discrimination against Whites.</p>
<p>But you raise the big question:Why does it continue. Answer:the pain level isn&rsquo;t high enough. When it is high enough, a critical number of Native Born White Americans will no longer give their consent to be goverened by the Republican-Democratic mafia.</p>
<p>There are millions of Native Born White American parents who have sons and daughters who graduated from college two weeks ago. These parents are hoping that the sacrifices they made to get their offspring  from birth to college will payoff. They are in for a rude awakening. Many of these recent White Male graduates will be economically nonviable and therefor unmarriable.</p>

		<p>The NPI needs to be the one to use legal means, taking the government, companies, and people to court over anti-white racism. Offering advice and legal assantance to whites who could use it. Heres a few things that make a successful civil rights group, as follow:</p>
<p>1. It would be great to address taking legal action against coperations, government, and others which practice anti-white policies.</p>
<p>2. It would also be great to address ways to protest media bias, for not reporting hate crimes against whites, attacking whites, and giving platforms to ADL and SPLC racist, without allowing the other side to voice opposition.</p>
<p>3. Addressing how to get involved in politics, such as contacting local leaders concerning our issues, how to hold or organize rallies.</p>
<p>4. How to approach reaching out to more people in a polite way.</p>
<p>5. How to organize a more united European/white front, including with our white family around the world.</p>
<p>6. How to pass out information, and using information to better our side.</p>
<p>7. How to reach out to fellow whites who need help.</p>

<p>Diversity makes it that much easier for conflict. Now of course there has always been conflcit among people who look, talk, and come from the same place. </p>
<p>Conflicts of different race, language, religous, and ethnic groups fighting, makes multi-culturalism/racialism that much worse. Whereas in a singulair racial/cultural nation you didn&rsquo;t have to worry about racial, laguage, or cultural conflicts.</p>
