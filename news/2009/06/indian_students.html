			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Harrison, Wall Street Journal, June 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Random violence against Indian students is damaging the reputation of Australia&rsquo;s growing tertiary-education industry.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 mostly Indian students protested the violence in a demonstration in the city Sunday and Monday. One recent attack in Melbourne left an Indian stabbing victim in a coma.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on Monday {snip} noted there are 90,000 Indians studying in Australia and more than 200,000 Australians of Indian descent.</p>
<p>Education of foreign students has become big business in Australia, generating 15.5 billion Australian dollars (US$12.54 billion) in 2008, Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard said last week. Foreigners now make up 25% of students, up from just under 10% in 1997.</p>
<p>The tertiary-education sector is now the nation&rsquo;s third-largest export earner behind coal and iron ore. In Victoria state, education is the biggest export earner.</p>
<p>The number of Indian students has doubled in the past three years, with two-thirds studying at private colleges.</p>
<p>Violence against the foreign students has been escalating over the past four years, according to Gautam Gupta, spokesman for the Federation of Indian Students of Australia. In Victoria state, police said 1,447 people of Indian origin were victims of crimes such as robberies and assaults in the year ending June 30, 2008, an increase from 1,082 in the previous year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In India, Australia is being labeled a racist nation in media reports, a claim made a number of times in recent years around Asia.</p>

		<p>Who is committing this violence?  If it&rsquo;s the good progressive Australia that I know, it&rsquo;s probably some minority group that has an axe to grind with India, probably Pakistani.</p>
<p>If Australia has the equivalent to the American H-1B visa program, then this is bad news.  One of my state&rsquo;s U.S. Senators, Dick Durbin, supposedly wants to change the H-1B rules to prevent abuse by the cheap labor lobby.  He has proposed not to let prospective H-1B visa users recruit from outside of the United States to fill the visas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Durbin is misguided, or he does know what I&rsquo;m about to say and is therefore being deceitful to gain sympathy.  But he&rsquo;s misguided or deceitful in two ways:  (1)  Do you actually think that MSFT, Intel, GOOG, ORCL, or any of the many big companies that use H-1B actually go to India to recruit Indians?  No, because they don&rsquo;t have to.  India for them is as close as their nearest university campus.  They recruit Indian students at American colleges that are here on student visas and are CSIT majors about to graduate.  (2)  To the small extent that anyone goes outside of America to recruit those who will have H-1B visas, it is actually good for us, because they&rsquo;re almost always white.  Two examples that pop right into my head are Linus Torvalds, and DVD Jon (Jon Lech Johansen), who Michael Robertson saved from political persecution by Norway&rsquo;s copywrong extremists, RIAA/MPAA equivalents.  Linus and DVD Jon are probably the furthest thing on Earth from cheap labor.  They come from Finnish (of Swedish descent) and Norway, respectively, both high wage high standard of living countries, and the latter&rsquo;s H-1B is more political than anything.</p>

		<p>Just last week two Indian fellas were robbed and beaten with axe handles by a gang of Sudanese refugees. I wonder if Mr Rudd is going to count those attacks with the aforementioned statisstics. I also wonder how many of the above stats are of similar cause.</p>

		<p>I am glad that whites are beginning to wake up.  But in a way I am starting to get disturbed by the increase in white violence we keep hearing about.  </p>
<p>In our country, a lot of the time, when the news reports a major shooting, there is a white person involved.  There was that story about the man up in Pittsburgh who shot the police because he was afraid that Obama would take his gun rights away.  There is the story of the white man shooting the abortionist.  There have been many stories making the news lately, in which the shooter is white.</p>
<p>Yes, I understand that the news is biased, and for every white person who commits a crime, there are 30 to 50 blacks, hispanics, and arabs etc&hellip; who are doing the same.  However, my point still stands, and is still valid.</p>
<p>Now we have this story about whites being violent towards Indians.  What exactly provoked this violence?  As I said before, I am glad that our people are waking up, but violence just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the traditional way whites handle things.  </p>
<p>Could it be that whites have had enough, the tip of the iceburg has been reached, and that whites feel like this is the only way to take their governments back?  Are we as whites getting desperate?</p>

     Yes, expect to see more and more news stories involving whites and gun violence. The MSM is ramping up for the big gun-grab after the next elections. They aren&rsquo;t at full steam yet, because so many liberals will lose their seats if the gun agenda is addressed. Wait until 2010. </p>

		<p>This story isnt actually what it seems. They arent actually racially motivated attacks. This has been covered by a few journalists in australia. Some of the attacks have been caught on security camera and werent done by white people. The problem is Victoria (the state melbourne is in) has a problem with police chronically underreporting crime to make their stats look better, in order to gain more funding. People have been complaining about it, but now they only listen once the indian students cry racism. </p>
<p>And in response to passingthru, Australia has a big money industry of giving international students college education. Private institutions are popping up all over the place to train them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Indian students represent about one-fifth of the 415,000 foreigners studying in Australia, second only to those from China, Access Economics said in a recent report prepared for the Australian Council for Private Education and Training.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did it ever occur to these people to just stay home and not have to worry about being in a foreign land where the natural inclination of the population&hellip;.any population&hellip;.is to resent and dislike foreigners?</p>

		<p>The elephant in the room, the one that the media is determined to ignore, is that many of the attacks against Indians are carried out by gangs of Africans - Sudanese and Somali &#8216;refugees&rsquo; that the government has foisted upon us. </p>
<p>Indian and Pakistani taxi drivers have also been attacked, beaten and robbed by the same gangs.</p>

<p>This is not a story about whites being violent towards Indians. I live in Sydney. These attacks are perpetrated by other races that have traditional dislikes for Indians. The races aren&rsquo;t mentioned because they want you to assume the perpetrators are white. </p>

<p>It seems very odd to me that you think white people have no tradition of violence. Do you read any history at all?</p>
<p>&#8220;Could it be that whites have had enough, the tip of the iceburg has been reached, and that whites feel like this is the only way to take their governments back? Are we as whites getting desperate?&#8221;</p>
<p>These attacks have nothing to do with &#8220;taking their governments back&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have never known white people to be &#8220;desperate&#8221;. I have known them to be DECISIVE, in the same way as a pit bull dog. Once the conditions for violence are met, the reaction seems to be automatic&hellip;..without long-winded discussions (which seem to be their trademark). But violent whites do not talk you to death, or threaten, or telegraph their attack with loud funny words.</p>
<p>They are quiet&hellip;.even silent.</p>

		<p>      OK, the attacks aren&rsquo;t mostly by Whites. But what if they<br>
were? Would that be wrong, if the attacks were ideologically<br>
motivated and not simply criminal? And by ideology I simply mean<br>
the desire to protect one&rsquo;s own land. Because, make no mistake,<br>
Austalia and the rest of the White World are profoundly threat-<br>
ened by this alien influx. The same thing will happen there that<br>
has happened. Africans will take the low level jobs and Asians<br>
will take the good ones. Random physical violence is horrible,<br>
but at the same time, for Whites to take an oath of pacifism <br>
would be a declaration of racial suicide. </p>

<p>Since PM Howard tried to increase foreign student intake. It actually DOES give a lot to the nation financially (more than our lotteries at least), and the foreign students I&rsquo;ve met are keen and quite friendly. They&rsquo;re not the overtrumpeted &#8220;third-world&#8221; stereotype. They have genuine and enlightening opinions. And yes, these attacks are sometimes racially motivated. Around Sydney they&rsquo;re known as &#8220;curry bashings&#8221;, and ARE mostly perpetrated by whites, although I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s quite a lot of other races involved too.</p>

		<p>&#8220;violence just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the traditional way whites handle things.&#8221; Oh really? What about WWI, WWII, the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, Viet Nam, we didn&rsquo;t talk the Indians out of this country, we took it by force. </p>
<p>Kennedy said, &#8220;When we make peaceful change impossible we make violent revolution inevitable.&#8221; In poll after poll we say we don&rsquo;t want Third World immigration but we just get more of it. Only because of fear of being forcibly thrown in jail by our government do we not move to stop this nonwhite migration. </p>
<p>Violence seems to be a very traditional way to handle things by all races of people.</p>

		<p>We have too many foreign students in Australia. Our pathetic left wing Socialist Govt. would prefer to invite foreigners into our Universities instead of training our own people, no wonder the so called skills shortage. There are 500,000 foreign students, mainly from Asia in Australia at the moment, way too many, we only have a population of 22,000,000. These Asian students do not benefit Australia but their own people and their communities. These asians have brought down wages, filled our brothels with their most promising, caused a housing / rental crisis and created social friction.</p>
<p>The Indians have a caste system, these bofheads are the creators of racism. Most of the attackers of these curry munchers are black. Just like the States most of our crime is perpetrated by non-whites. </p>

<p>I should also add that the students aren&rsquo;t coming here for a great education. Our universities and colleges have been dumbed down to account for all the full-fee paying Asian students who can&rsquo;t speak English. They come here because tertiary education is a precursor to immigration.</p>

		<p>Immigration is the ONLY reason the vast majority of these people are in Australia, talk to some of them. The worst part is many of these Asian students are going to be the elites of the future in Australia. They&rsquo;re not studying to become plumbers, electricians, or bricklayers - they&rsquo;re going to be the next doctors, surgeons, dentists, pharmacists, economists, bankers, lawyers, etc. </p>
<p>A Canadian lecturer at an Australian university one said &#8220;In 50 years Australia is going to have an Asian ruling class&#8221;. He was promptly given the boot, as you would (unfortunately) expect, but he was dead right. I predict white Australia is going to revolt against this in the next 10-20 years, probably not before Europe does, but not long after.</p>

<p>It looks like Australia is simply taking over the educating of Asians and Indians that America has been increasingly curtailing since 9/11 and the growing lack of resources due to the Hispanic expansion in America.</p>

<p>What an insulting conclusion for Indians to come to.  In order to ask this question you have to first assume that Indians are making Australia great to begin with. The fact of the matter is that while they can make India great, Australia would do just fine without them.  Indians are so arrogant, they make me sick.  Oh how in the world did white countries get to the moon, split the atom, or discover America without Indians?????<br>

<p>In many ways Indians disgust me more than any other immigrant group (or nonwhite group).  What disgusts me about them is their arrogance that they haven&rsquo;t even earned yet and the fact that they are the only group that is attributed with qualities by Western medias all over the world that aren&rsquo;t even realities. </p>
<p>Indians themselves have their own rewritten histories about their country that aren&rsquo;t even based on facts.  Do a search on it.  Most Indians think that all knowledge in the world originally came from India, even the stuff that is well documented as coming from Greece. They believe that India was an advanced society until the British came in and &#8220;messed things up&#8221;.  </p>
<p>That is why now, according to them, India is such a mess of a country and why Indian engineers etc&hellip; are entitled to move to white countries and do our work that we are &#8220;too stupid to do ourselves&#8221;.  Afterall, according to them, it is unfair that the white man went to the moon first, considering that all the science and math needed for that was taken from India.</p>
<p>This is what these people actually believe.  And our Western liberal professors and teachers feed into this garbage.  Our media and politicians tell them day in and day out &#8220;we need you in our countries&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am sick of it.  We have this third world immigrant group scattered around the Western world that, as I said above, is given positive attributes by Western leaders that aren&rsquo;t even realities.  The fact of the matter is that most science has always come out of the West, going back to the Greeks, and this is exactly why the West is great today and India IS NOT.  </p>
<p>The hypocrisy of this group of people disgusts me.  The fact that they have the nerve to move to our societies and look down on us without acknowledging the true reason they are here to begin with.  They are obviously here because our societies are superior to theirs&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>It is time for us as whites to stop kowtowing to this group of people.  We don&rsquo;t need them among us and we never did.  </p>
