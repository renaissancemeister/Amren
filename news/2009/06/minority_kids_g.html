<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-06-16-youngminorities_N.htm">Minority Kids Grow to Majority in Some Counties</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Haya El Nasser, USA Today, June 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Young Americans who are minorities outnumber young whites in almost one of every six U.S. counties. It&rsquo;s a demographic wave that is transforming more parts of the nation and raising questions about who is a minority.</p>
<p>An analysis of the under-20 population shows that minority youths are the majority in 505 counties and that 60 counties have reached that milestone in this decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;The change is due both to minority kids&rsquo; gains and to declines in the number of white kids,&#8221; says Kenneth Johnson, demographer at the University of New Hampshire&rsquo;s Carsey Institute who analyzed Census data. &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t about immigration anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Black, Hispanic and Asian families are moving to suburbia. Some have come for jobs created by population growth. Others leave urban areas in search of more space, better schools and less crime. Most counties where the minority youth population surged past 50% from 2000 to 2008 are suburban or rural counties. Three are around Atlanta.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Several predominantly white counties that are attracting young minorities have lost young white residents because of a decline in agriculture. Many who went away to college never came back. The remaining white population is aging and having fewer children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among youths ages 15 to 19, 60% are non-Hispanic whites. Among those 4 or younger, 53% are white.</p>

		<p> Notice that a minority journalist   &mdash;   Haya El Nasser   &mdash;   was chosen by USA Today to write this piece. Kind of a way of sticking a thumb in the eye of us White people who are being bred right out of a majority in our own country.</p>
<p> And it didn&rsquo;t have to happen. Look up the statistics for the 1960 census and you&rsquo;ll see that Caucasians made up 89 percent of the population then. But, in the 1960s, the likes of Hubert Humphrey and Ted Kennedy pushed changes in our immigration laws through Congress to assure that most new immigrants would be non-White   &mdash;   or at least, noticeably darker than the 89 percent was. White guilt over slavery and &#8220;stealing&#8221; Mexico&rsquo;s territory and the Indians&rsquo; land, ad nauseum, you know. Have to make amends   &mdash;   even if it turns the country into a polyglot mess.</p>
<p> White people nowadays won&rsquo;t raise the size families that would reverse the trend   &mdash;   except for a few isolated groups like the Mormons, Orthodox Jews and Amish. So I guess we&rsquo;re condemned to become just another minority group in the country our ancestors built, in just a few more years. At least it will make it harder for blacks to claim they&rsquo;re being discriminated against as &#8220;minorities.&#8221; We&rsquo;ll all be minorities! </p>

		<p>A key point is that for four and under youngsters only 53% are white. The newest generation of whites is definitely going to be simply the largest minority in a nation of minorities. The question is how long they will remain deracinated, as most of the older generations of whites are, especially when the other, faster growing minorities play &#8220;hardball&#8221; when it comes to identity politics. Being &#8220;low men and women&#8221; on the &#8220;minority totem pole&#8221; is going to certainly cause some kind of reaction, especially if the United States enters before too much longer Third World economic status, something that seems to be going on very quickly and right before our very own eyes.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s tough to tell because the map is small, but my (Sacramento) county doesn&rsquo;t look dark blue.  I don&rsquo;t see ANY white people around here (outside, of course, at work).  My Walmart is like a third-world bazaar, with Punjabi customers trying to talk to Mexican clerks while black Americans without receipts scream at Vietnamese girls at the return counter. it&rsquo;s hell, and I&rsquo;m not even a dark blue county.</p>
<p>Sad for me to see colored counties in Idaho and some of the other states I dream of escaping to.<br>

		<p>While Whites sit and do nothing about it, as usual&hellip;Reverse the invasion (deportation of them all) and then stop any further invasions and maybe then Whites will have more children since they won&rsquo;t be supporting &#8220;others&#8221; children! I believe many Whites don&rsquo;t want any White children when they look around and see what is happening to their race and their own nation full of nonwhites. The only Whites who have babies are having bi-racial ones.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Non-whites majority of under-20 population in nearly one of every six US counties.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more data coming out in the MSM the next three years regarding white population figures the more chance we will have to draw more people to our side as the country gets closer to collapsing.</p>
<p>With proper preparation we can be a dominant force in the next couple of years or so, if we refuse to allow the leftist self-hating whites admission to our groups. Let them live with the blacks.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, most Conservatives are too concerned with what is going on thousands and thousands of miles away in Iran and  Korea, or the silly squabbling between Sarah Palin and David Letterman, to pay much mind to their own country being yanked right out from under their nose as they sit idly by. </p>
<p>No war(or terrorism for that matter)will ever be needed to overtake and fully gain control of the United States. The enemy troops are already in place, albeit currently uniformed in diapers, &#8220;onesies,&#8221; shortpants, and booties.   </p>

<p>So true.  When all the whites in the country are murdered or gone, they&rsquo;ll blame the whites in other countries.</p>
<p>If/when we&rsquo;re all gone, they&rsquo;ll probably blame &#8220;centuries of evil white imperialism&#8221; for their failures.</p>
<p>As a 20 year old, this is immensely depressing.  Also, unlike in europe - there&rsquo;s no one to vote for who wants to change course and avert the demographic destruction of our nation.</p>
<p>We need a slightly more intense version of the British National Party over here.</p>

		<p>The sentences in the article that suggest that there is an imbalance in the age structure among Whites and non-Whites don&rsquo;t really need to be in there. It&rsquo;s pretty obvious for anyone with eyes! I volunteer in a Convalescent home in my town which is 65% white, and of course 98%+ of the patience in their are old White people. There are even several sources on the internet that reveal that about half the Mestizo population in the U.S. is under age 25 and half of the White population is over 44. And the white population is just going to age more rapidly in the coming decades because academia and media pushes the idea that &#8220;children are undesirable&#8221; and White youth pick up on it, while the other races don&rsquo;t. I hate to sound optimstic but we may not be able to save the white race during this century, it could be several generations down the line when there is far fewer of us and our people will wake up. By 2050, my guess is that a Kindergarten classroom in the U.S. will resemble similar demographics of Brazil.</p>

		<p>The growing number of ethnic minorities at the younger age levels is just another indication of a demographic warfare campaign by the left against Western Civilization and any sort of conservatism in government.</p>
<p>With regard to the relationship between politics and demographics there is a rather curious timeline about that relationship that is very obvious, but has not been discussed very often.  Specifically, the hard-core left when faced with the futility of trying to convert the rather decently paid workers in the Western nations to the left from the 1950&rsquo;s onwards have instead focused on racial / ethnic inequality as a vehicle to power.  The left (and anyone with half a brain - excludes the Republican National Committee, National Review, and the neo-cons) knows there is a directly proportional relationship between the percentage of these permanently aggrieved groups in a nation and the political power of the left in those nations.  </p>
<p>Therefore, from the 1960&rsquo;s onwards, the left has been pushing a racial grievances and pro-immigration agendas with an increasing fervor.  So the demographics you see on the chart are as much an indication of the expansion of the power of the neo-communists as was the &#8220;Iron Curtain&#8221; taking control over much of Europe after World War II.  Only this time the &#8220;Red Army&#8221; is not composed of soldiers and tanks, but rather armies of mass immigration, anchor babies, and subsidized minorities who will vote in their Lenins (Obamas)to ensure a permanent government of the left. </p>

		<p>Folks, if you have Firefox, you can go to the original article, click on the little map to get the bigger map in a pop-up window, then hit the &#8216;control&rsquo; and &#8216;+&rsquo; keys, to blow up the map.  You can make it pretty big.</p>
<p>Pity we can&rsquo;t print out the map.  I&rsquo;d keep a copy in the atlas that stays in the car.  I keep lots of demographic trends maps in the car.  Knowing what places to avoid can save your life.</p>

		<p>All of those counties in the north are sparsely populated Indian reservation. What this map shows is roughly where the country will break up along racial lines.</p>
