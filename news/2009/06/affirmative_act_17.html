<h1>Affirmative Action Meant to Give Our Best and Brightest Minorities a Leg Up</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Victor Landa, San Antonio Express-News, June 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Why is it that when a person of an ethnic, gender, cultural or racial minority rises in the ranks of their profession they&rsquo;re suspected of benefiting from affirmative-action programs?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The first thing is that affirmative action is considered by some to be a cause for suspicion. As if it&rsquo;s something that should be hidden. And second, that being a minority trumps competence.</p>
<p>On the first thing, we seem to forget the reason that affirmative-action programs were set up to begin with. The reasoning is that through these programs the brightest, most competent, overlooked minorities would have an opportunity to rise to positions once reserved for less competent majority peers. {snip}</p>
<p>Affirmative-action programs were meant to provide our country with the benefit of its brightest minds and greatest potential. But over the years it has been derided as an unfair substitute for competence. The narrative is despicable. It claims that if not for the program minorities would be undeserving of the opportunities and positions afforded to them.</p>
<p>The complaint is that affirmative action displaces deserving students and applicants. A case in point is Supreme Court Justice nominee Sonia Sotomayor, who unapologetically says that she&rsquo;s the product of affirmative action. The rap against her, among the many that have surfaced, is that affirmative action somehow proves her incompetence.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t the whole affirmative-action idea about judging people by their actions and output? Shouldn&rsquo;t we be concerned about Sotomayor&rsquo;s opinions from the bench and not whether she benefited from affirmative action?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There was news this week of President Obama&rsquo;s record for appointing minorities, Latinos specifically, to positions within his administration. The reports put his Latino appointment percentage at just above 11, the most for any president in the history of the United States; more than his immediate predecessor, more than Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Apparently every effort has been made to reach out and find Latino talent, and the criticism will be soon and swift. Latinos are taking their place among the best and brightest and the country will be the better for it. And if affirmative action had a role in opening the doors of opportunity for smart, hardworking and exceptional men and women, then so be it.</p>

		<p>If affirmative action gave a slight edge to a black or hispanic who had the same qualifications as a white (such as SAT score, civil service test score, educational achievement) it could be justifiable.  But affirmative action promotes the less qualified over the better qualified.  The standards for minority applicants (and for women competing for physically-intense careers such as fire fighter and police work) are lowered.  And no matter how hard an organization tries to be fair and objective if they don&rsquo;t come up with the correct percentage of minorities they are in big trouble.<br>

		<p>If they were so bright, they wouldn&rsquo;t need affirmative action.</p>
<p>A few days ago, President Obama put his foot in his mouth when he announced his decision to extend some benefits received by married Federal employees to those who are in a homosexual marriage.  He said that he did this so that the Federal government could attract and retain the best people.  As if heterosexuals and non-&#8220;married&#8221; gays are stupid, backwards incompetents that the Feds have to settle for.</p>

		<p>You have to give the Left credit - they never say die and evidently never tire of reinventing their pet projects and ideological follies to adapt them to a new age and/or situation and otherwise explain away why, when assessing these same ideas and actions, failure after failure is no evidence whatever of failure!! They are as predictable as they are maddening!</p>

		<p>Minorities don&rsquo;t need a &#8220;leg up&#8221; today. They have  more opportunities than Whites. The goal of a society should be equal opportunity period, nor racial preferences. In an equal opportunity sociey, the best and the brightest will naturally take their place, you don&rsquo;t have to look for them. Unfortunantly, with affirmative action, the reality is that businesses are required to have a certain percentage of minorities and often less qualified minorities are give places they shouldn&rsquo;t have or standards are lowered.</p>

<p>The &#8220;best and brightest minorities&#8221; shouldn&rsquo;t need a &#8220;leg up, if they were as competent as the average 100 I.Q. white.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that they are not.</p>

		<p>Victor Landa should be required to give up his job so it can be given to one of those &#8220;best and brightest&#8221; minorities.</p>
<p>The truth is that those &#8220;best and brightest&#8221; minorities are about as competent as mediocre, middle-of-the-road whites.  By hiring them you push out whites who really are the best and brightest.  This is a non-issue only if you think that actual performance doesn&rsquo;t matter for doctors, lawyers, managers, policemen, firemen, and military officers.</p>
<p>Affirmative action is racism.<br>

<p>Well if that is the way we should look at it, then Mr. Landa ought to be rallying against Sotomayor&rsquo;s Supreme Court nomination. After all, 60% of the cases she has ruled on in the past, were overturned on appeal.</p>
<p>Some competency! Pardon me Landa, but your bias is showing!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t really believe what he&rsquo;s saying. It&rsquo;s been my experience that wherever there is the most affirmative action, or the most progressive thought, it is there they go on the Most/Where The Public Face is all about how it is Whites who are discriminating. Just insensitive. If Mr Landa really is upset, and he really does believe affirmative action is unfairly stigmatizing people, people of color, there certainly is something that can be done to end this unfair burden. </p>

		<p>Hey, Victor! Are you familiar with the New Haven Firefighters case currently being decided by the Supreme Court? I guess not but its just one example among thousands that show us how Afirmative Action works.</p>
<p>Promotions were to go to the top 20 based on the grades on a test. This test had been screened to be non racially biased. The top 20 scores were those of ALL white men. The one hispanic out of the top 20 is white. NO blacks scored in the top 20. None. Zilch.</p>
<p>So the test was thrown out by the City of New Haven because no blacks would have been promoted based on the scores of the COMPETENCY test.</p>
<p>So, senior, there is your Afirmative Action.</p>

<p>The more minorities Obama appoints, the more he increases the size of government, the less chance the Democrats have of retaining their legislative seats in the midterm elections.  That is how it&rsquo;s always been and it will remain so within the next four years.</p>

		<p>It would seem that if this strange theory had any basis in fact the &#8220;brightest minorities&#8221; would now be running all the major corporations and enterprises in America.  After all, affirmative action has been going on for three decades now, putting these people in positions of authority and power, where they almost invariably fail, to be shunted off to make-work positions where they can&rsquo;t do too much damage.</p>
<p>In the not very distant future I believe this nation will break up, largely along racial lines.  Blacks, and to a lesser extent Hispanics, will be largely isolated and forbidden entry to white and East Asian areas.  </p>

		<p>Geez, what an obnoxious article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;we seem to forget the reason that affirmative-action programs were set up to begin with..&#8221;</p>
<p>Affirmative Action programs were set up to give preferences to NAMs over Whites so that &#8216;persons of color can receive the rewards of society that they could not win in free and fair competition.&rsquo; (see Ricci vs. DeStefano) https://tinyurl.com/lvjzna.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It claims that if not for the program minorities would be undeserving of the opportunities and positions afforded to them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Explain to me clearly how it is that NAMs with clearly lesser SAT scores and lower life-long achievement are selected over higher-scoring Whites?</p>
<p>sotomeyor herself said the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;If we had gone through the traditional numbers route of those institutions,&rsquo; says Sotomayor, &#8216;it would have been highly questionable if I would have been accepted. &hellip; My test scores were not comparable to that of my classmates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then what could possibly be the reason sotomeyor was accepted over those with higher achievement scores?  How does rejecting the highest scoring Whites and Asians &#8216;provide our country with the benefit of its brightest minds and greatest potential when, in fact, that is exactly what AA does? </p>
<p>Why was sotomeyor, someone admitted to Princeton, advised by Princton  &mdash;   &#8220;to get up to speed on her English&hellip;.read children&rsquo;s classics and study basic grammar books during her summers&hellip;?&#8221;</p>
<p>As Pat Buchanan explains:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;her academic career appears to have been a fraud from beginning to end, a testament to Ivy League corruption&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And lastly:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Shouldn&rsquo;t we be concerned about Sotomayor&rsquo;s opinions from the bench and not whether she benefited from affirmative action?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/mwxl2d</p>
<p>Yes, lay it all out  &mdash;  SAT scores LSAT scores, scores on the bar exam, her opinions, articles all of her decisions that have been overturned (60%)  &mdash;  put them under a microscope for proper vetting.  Question sotomeyor the same way Judge Bork was questioned.  Let obama, who voted against Judge Roberts, explain why sotomeyor is a better candidate for the Supreme Court.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But isn&rsquo;t the whole affirmative-action idea about judging people by their actions and output?&#8221;  In reality, affirmative action is not at all about judging people by their ability but by their racial profile. &#8220;Affirmative action&#8221; is merely code for racial preference for any race other than caucasion. It is government-sanctioned  discrimination against one race in favor of another. So, breaking it down, one could (honestly) say our government follows the policy(?!): &#8220;two wrongs DO make a right&#8221;. I thought government-sanctioned discrimination was supposed to have been abolished and supposedly illegal? Where&rsquo;s the media outcry? Where is the &#8220;level playing-field&#8221; that is inherent in a truly fair and equitable society?</p>

		<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is that people are outrage about this, but continue to hide in the shadows for fear of persecution. We need to fight fire with fire. Form a lobby group to finally wipe this unfair law off the books. If we are considering taking don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell off the books. They should also throw this outdated law out with it as well. You want fair here it is&hellip;. </p>

<p>The notion that affirmative action once existed for whites is completely false. There were never any qualified minorities applying to college in the first place. The black valedictorian with a perfect SAT score who applied to Harvard in 1940 did not lose his spot to a less qualified white man   &mdash;   he did not exist! And if we removed affirmative action, colleges would revert to their former state, albeit with more Asians (and the incessant cries of discrimination would only grow louder).</p>
<p>Consider this: The average LSAT scores at the top law schools (e.g. Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Columbia) are over 170. Only 23 blacks scored above a 170 last year. This means that there would be almost no black students    &mdash;   no Barack Obama, no Eric Holder, and no Sonia Sotomayor   &mdash;   at the top law schools if affirmative action were not practiced.<br>

Many of the AmRen blogger&rsquo;s do better, and they have day jobs. This &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; is working out pretty good for the sensitive folks. From there they can complain about it or ask for more.  </p>

		<p>They are still pushing their propaganda 40 years later? I thought AA was to last 25 years? Equality NEVER meant a &#8220;leg up&#8221; for certain groups as so many seem to believe nowadays. It was meant to keep the White man down and keep him down&hellip;notice that Civil Rights, AA, desegregation and NON-white immigration all happened about the same time? Coincidence?

		<p>The author&rsquo;s reasoning does not add up.  One&rsquo;s decisions from the bench are a byproduct of their competence.  It stands to reason that a person with higher competence would produce BETTER legal opinions than someone with lower competence.  And as someone noted above, Ms. Sotomayor has a 60% &#8220;rejection&#8221; rate when her opinion/decisions are appealed.  So is the author asking that we should accept lesser opinions and legal reasoning?  If you follow his logic, that is exactly what he is implying.</p>

		<p>I hope that the New Haven firemen lose their case.  I hope that affirmative action remains in place nationwide.  I do not want the Reds to pull off another of their Two steps forward, one step back victories.  I do not want the regime in this country to save themselves by improving the competence of their workforce with Whites.  Let their pet minorities drag them down.  I do not want Whites to think that it&rsquo;s OK now, justice has been done, while the thieves are allowed to keep all they stole on the promise that they won&rsquo;t steal any more.  I want as many Whites as possible to experience affirmative action, and know what I know and feel what I feel.

		<p>&#8220;Affirmative action&#8221; does NOTHING to &#8220;level the playing field&#8221;. Rather, it has the opposite effect.  I know that when I see a &#8220;person of color&#8221; in a position of authority or a professional, a question arises: How did he get there?  Was it by his own hard work or did he get a &#8220;leg up&#8221; through &#8220;affirmative action&#8221;?  This is not racist, merely being realistic.<br>
Chappaquiddick &#8220;ted&#8221; kennedy pushed one of the first &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; candidates through &#8220;medical school&#8221;.  The guy turned out to be a &#8220;butcher&#8221;, incompetent and eventually lost his medical &#8220;license&#8221;.  How many lives did &#8220;ted&#8221; kennedy&rsquo;s &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; push help destroy?<br>
It was hubert humphrey who once said that he would &#8220;eat his hat&#8221; if &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; ever resulted in quotas.  Look at what happened.</p>
