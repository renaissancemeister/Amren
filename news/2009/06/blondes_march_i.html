			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), May 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Led by an orchestra, the first-ever blonde parade featured women dressed in pink and white, some accompanied by lapdogs, in a charity fund-raising event that organisers hope will become an annual event.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not stupid. I&rsquo;m beautiful and I&rsquo;ll prove it,&#8221; Ilona Zigure, a participant, said.</p>
<p>Organisers said they were determined to bring positive energy to their country, expected to see its economy contract by 16 per cent this year.</p>
<p>The parade was part of a &#8220;Blonde Weekend&#8221; which also featured a blonde golf tournament, a little lady fashion show, an evening ball, and a children&rsquo;s drawing competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a great time to spend in the parade and contribute to a charity,&#8221; said Ieva, one blonde spectator.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally something different, something positive because I&rsquo;m tired of hearing about the crisis,&#8221; said another, 70-year-old Ausma.</p>
<p>The event attracted many locals and puzzled tourists.</p>
<p>Following the parade, blondes climbed into open-topped cars and drove to the local shopping centre.</p>
<p>The money collected during the event will be donated to support children&rsquo;s safety and playgrounds for disabled children in Riga and across Latvia.</p>
<p>The organisers want to make May 31 official Blondes&rsquo; Day in Latvia.</p>
<p>Latvia, a small Baltic nation with the population of 2.3 million people has been going through the deepest recession in the European Union, which it joined in 2004.</p>

		<p>Very nice!  I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if it does become an annual event.  In October, 1810 Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria organized a great horse race to celebrate his nuptials with Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen.  Everyone liked it so much, they decided to come back again the following year.  Today it&rsquo;s called &#8220;Oktoberfest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, something like that could never happen over here.  The event organizers would immediately be branded &#8220;racists&#8221; and  forced to make a public apology.  Then they&rsquo;d lose their jobs.  Students in local schools would be forced to undergo &#8220;sensitivity training&#8221; to be made to realize that swarthy peoples from darkest Africa are just as beautiful.  Finally, the gang over at &#8220;Air America&#8221; would ridicule it while making the obligatory &#8220;dumb blonde&#8221; jokes.</p>

		<p>Now this is my kind of parade. I hope when they are through, they can spread this &#8220;cheer&#8221; into future generations by having and raising many blonde-haired children so we can enjoy this tradition for many years to come.</p>

		<p>In 1949, the good people behind our noble ally Uncle Joe Stalin saw fit to deport to Siberia the aunts and cousins of these Latvian beauties, and their babies, after a two year study for the de-Kulakization of the Baltics.</p>
<p>A first wave of deportations of &#8220;enemies of the state&#8221; took place in 1941 but was interrupted by Nazi Germany&rsquo;s invasion of Russia, breaking the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent Baltic States to the Soviet sphere of influence.</p>
<p>With the defeat of Nazi Germany and the re-occupation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union, an even more savage round of deportations was launched.</p>
<p>More than two years in the planning, the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale.</p>
<p>For example, in Estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week. More than three-quarters of Estonian deportees were women and children. Some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war.</p>
<p>The Communist Party said the actions were needed in order to &#8220;eliminate the kulaks (wealthy peasants) as a class.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Honkey America will get its turn before too long.  Probably while we are quibbling about the rights of Libertarians to democratically determine our future.</p>

		<p>Such an event would never even get off the planning stage in England.<br>
  Unfortunately what can only be termed as &#8216;militant feministas&rsquo;(they managed to get the &#8216;Benny Hill Show&rsquo; and &#8216;Miss World&rsquo; removed from our television screens as their petty little Freudian truimphs), seem to hold all the reins of power and England - and such an event would be the ultimate anathema to them, this is not to mention the shrill outbursts from muslims and black women.</p>

		<p>Blondes are very overrated. In my opinion, the probability that a (white) brunette will be attractive is higher than the probability that a blonde will be. I&rsquo;ve never understood why some white guys (I&rsquo;m white myself) are so irrationally attracted to blondes. I sincerely believe that you could put a blonde wig on a broomstick and some white men will still lose their marbles. </p>

		<p>Post #9 Writer, on June 2, 2009 had stated that Whites should move to Latvia and support their economies.  </p>
<p>Well, even though I am inspired to do so, just after viewing the attached photograph of beautiful Blondes, I believe that it is certainly within our power, as a Group, to support such Independent White Nations, that still hold fast to their culture and Race. </p>
<p>We Whites need to finacially support other White Nations such as the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as the Ukraine, Iceland, Ireland, and Scotland.</p>
<p>These Countries are certainly in difficult economic situations, as we all are, but there needs to be a concerted outreach on our part, to encourage them, and support them. </p>
<p>We should make a point of buying from White Countries, first and foremost. I try and buy &#8220;Made in the USA&#8221;, but too many Corporations have outsourced their Factories overseas, in non-White Countries. </p>
<p>Of course, there are Companies that still make quality products right here, but you really have to search for them. They include Bates&rsquo; Oxfords, which is a Uniform shoe. Also, Corcoran Oxfords, which are made in Pennsylvania. Red Wing shoes are also made here. </p>
<p>This may seem insignificant to most people, unless your job is on the line, for the lack of sales of quality-made shoes, to fellow Americans. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose every last Factory of quality products, and put more Countrymen on the streets, so &#8220;Buy American&#8221; when you can. </p>
<p>Then, spend your money on items for yourself, or gifts, on quality goods from the Countries named above. </p>
<p>Purchase the Aran Island hand made sweater, or Donegal Tweed Cap, that is made in Ireland, from your local Irish Import Store. </p>
<p>Many Celtic items such as jewelry, scarfs, sweaters, and caps that are hand-made in Scotland, can be ordered through Scottish Vendors, such as &#8220;Pipers&rsquo; Cove&#8221; in New Jersey, the &#8220;Scottish Lion&#8221; in New Hampshire, and &#8220;J. Higgins&#8221; in Kansas. </p>
<p>When the Muslims were burning Danish and Norwegian flags, for the publication of a Cartoon of Mohammed in their Newspapers, while also calling for a Boycott of their products, I went to the Grocery Store and made a purchase of Dansk Danish Cookies, as well as several cans of King Oscar sardines, from Norway.</p>
<p>Again, it is not the amount of the purchase, but the fact that making this purchase is a symbolic gesture, that I will stand on the side of the Danes, and Norwegians, and Freedom of the Press.<br>

<p>Detriment? I&rsquo;m a non blond-white myself so I hope not, but yet one of my two children is blond?<br>
Yet for all I know with my family talking of our Irish, Scottish and Prussain mixes, I could have some Mediterranean blood too.<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/oxh9ce" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/oxh9ce</a><br>
And what pencentage of the world&rsquo;s population do you think blond people be currently? <br>
About 1% maybe or less?<br>
By 2050 when the we have 10 billion people, what will they be then?<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/43zf5j" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/43zf5j</a><br>
I certainly prefer the word &#8216;evolution&rsquo; over &#8216;mutation&rsquo;, as it has a more positive tone about it.<br>
So yes I want our &#8216;evolved&rsquo; blonds, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2jfcpf" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2jfcpf</a><br>
to be preserved.<br>
And as for blue eyed people, we all are descended from one common ancestor. <br>
&#8220;We are family&#8221;!<br>

<p>Of course not. I think blond hair and blue eyes are probably the most visibly reconsible and distinct White European traits I can think thought of, a symbol if you will. <br>

&hellip;yes?</p>
<p><i>I can never get enough of the nordicism that permeates modern white nationalism.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more of a colorist than a nordist, well I always end up being a &#8216;ist&rsquo; of some sort.<br>

<a href="https://tinyurl.com/q8mkck" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/q8mkck</a> (a much posted video, sorry) <br>
Probably a more popular idealogy globally.</p>
<p>When I said..<br>
<i>Evolution=heading towards the light.</i><br>
I was actually abstractly thinking about single cell organisms going towards light as heat/energy. Moths and flames.<br>
And how powerful men in most cultures usually pick fair skinned woman, hence successful people&rsquo;s bloodlines get lighter over time.</p>
<p><i>Miscengenation=no more blondes.</i><br>
Speaks for itself really, we have recessive genes.<br>
To me when something is rare, it is special and thus is valuable.</p>
<p><i>Hair dye does not suffice.</i><br>
As there is no subsitute for autheticity.</p>
