<h1><a href="http://www.seattlemedium.com/news/Article/Article.asp?NewsID=96908&amp;sID=3&amp;ItemSource=L">Nagin Takes On Race Relations in His Final State of New Orleans Address</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Louisiana Weekly, June 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In his final State of the City address May 20, New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin tackled a wide range of issues including ongoing recovery efforts, crime, redevelopment of the Iberville housing development and a possible new home for City Hall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He recounted a number of examples of the racial divide in New Orleans, including the murder of Black college student Levon Jones by four White bouncers outside a local bar, a discrimination lawsuit involving former Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan and a study of the French Quarter that revealed that Black patrons were routinely forced to pay cover charges and charged higher prices than White patrons. Referring to the racially divisive months after Hurricane Katrina during which policy changes were made while many Blacks were still displaced in other states and unable to vote, Nagin said, &#8220;We fought each other, blamed each other, vilified certain leaders, targeted and defamed some, and have come to the point where trust in the city is at a very low level. Sorry, but this is the naked truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five years from now,&#8221; Nagin continued, &#8220;what will we say about ourselves? What will honest, objective historians write about all of us? Did we come together after facing the ultimate challenge?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t discuss his clandestine meeting with wealthy White businessmen in Dallas in the days after Hurricane Katrina about the future of New Orleans.</p>
<p>When asked by the media about that gathering, Nagin said it was appropriate to meet with the all-White group because Black New Orleans residents didn&rsquo;t participate in the economy in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>During his speech, Nagin referred to a New York Times article that reportedly quoted a political expert that said &#8220;every white person in the city&#8221; hated the mayor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know this road to recovery has not been easy,&#8221; the mayor, who recently earned the lowest approval rating of any mayor in the history of New Orleans, said Wednesday. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ironically, some credit the mayor with bringing Black and White voters together on a number of issues involving his performance including a lack of transparency at City Hall, a family-owned business that secured a Home Depot contract before eventually shutting down, the slow pace of post-Katrina recovery efforts, the city&rsquo;s inability to get crime cameras working properly, a series of dinners and parties at expensive restaurants on the taxpayer&rsquo;s dime, the infamous remark about violent crime keeping &#8220;the New Orleans brand&#8221; out there, the city&rsquo;s treatment of the homeless population and a series of Nagin family vacations allegedly paid for by a company directly or indirectly doing business with the city.</p>

		<p>I did not see anything in his speech about Chocolate City being Number 1 in the murder rate.  Every white person in the city might hate Mayor Nagin, trouble is that only applies to about three people.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is why Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu wanted to leave that to become Mayor of New Orleans, four years ago.  Why would you want to jump from a bed of silk sheets to a frying pan?</p>

		<p>The problem with New Orleans, Mr. Nagin, is the black criminals there, but even worse than that is your failure to place the blame where blame rightfully belongs, because you&rsquo;re a racist, biased black who blames whites for black failure and incompetence and refuses to recognize that your race is so unintelligent and prone to violence they can&rsquo;t create a civil society that works anywhere on earth.</p>

		<p>No mention of the white girl who got shot to death in that all black neighborhood while campaigning for Obama, and had her corpse lying on a sidewalk for hours.</p>
<p>Of course we all know that only white on black crime matters, not black on white crime - which happens at a much higher rate.</p>

<p>Awesome!  Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;including the murder of Black college student Levon Jones by four White bouncers outside a local bar&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, a case of alleged racism perpetrated by Whites against Blacks&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;a discrimination lawsuit involving former Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, a case of alleged racism perpetrated by Whites against Blacks&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;and a study of the French Quarter that revealed that Black patrons were routinely forced to pay cover charges and charged higher prices than White patrons&#8221;</p>
<p>And a case&hellip; of alleged racism perpetrated by Whites against Blacks&hellip;</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Who / what is the cause of &#8220;the racial divide&#8221; here?</p>

		<p>The Louisiana Weekly is a black liberation newspaper. The local university, UNO, was trimmed off a bit about 30 or 40 years ago. The local black college, SUNO, got exclusive rights to some of the programs   &mdash;   one of which is journalism. I spend the first 30 years of my life in New Orleans and I consider myself an expert on black behavior. The fact that the Louisiana Weekly quoted Nagin about the lack of black contributions to the city is a PROFOUND editorial mistake   &mdash;   exactly the kind of mistake you would expect from black-university educated blacks in a majority black city. </p>

		<p>Blacks need birth control.  Blacks who have children out of wedlock should have abortions.  Their children are not employable and they enslave the white man.  I&rsquo;m for their abortion. </p>

Remember Katrina? It turns out Mr. Nagin never got around to completing his local hurricane center. It&rsquo;s an all but abandoned project.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not an imminent crisis, it&rsquo;s not important to blacks. Besides, who needs a center to track hurricanes when the real money from the government comes from ignoring them. That&rsquo;s the jackpot.</p>

		<p>Nagin did at least one &#8220;positive&#8221; thing, from my viewpoint: He went after the guns of the people of New Orleans, in the wake of Katrina. I don&rsquo;t mean that in itself is positive. What I mean is, he finally affirmed what would happen to Americans if the government came for their guns - chaos, just, like us gunowners kept saying.</p>
<p>For years, gunowners were wary of the government seizing lawfully owned guns, especially during a time of crises. The left, academia and the media kept saying over and over, &#8220;Nobody&rsquo;s trying to take your guns away&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, it finally happened. Nagin went so far as to say the Second Amendment did NOT apply in New Orleans, arrogant. Obama and his ilk are wondering why Americans are purchasing guns and ammunition at high rates, during this time of economic recession. Nagin supplies the answer.</p>
<p>Never turn your guns over to any regime, let alone one headed by a black.</p>

<p>And just WHAT is that supposed to mean. That racist rich White business owners wouldn&rsquo;t hire Blacks? I kept hearing those whines about NOLA&rsquo;s poor Blacks in the aftermath of Katrina. But no one saw fit to explain WHY Blacks there were unable to get decent jobs&hellip; in a city with a Black mayor, a majority Black administration   &mdash;   police and fire departments. A substantial Black population.</p>
<p>Oh, speaking of Mayor Nagin&hellip; whatever happened to those 28 stolen, sorry I meant &#8220;borrowed&#8221; Cadillacs needed to patrol NOLA&rsquo;s water and debris strewn streets after Katrina.</p>

<p>There simply weren&rsquo;t enough City government jobs available at the time, there will be a HUGE number of FED government jobs available for blacks very soon I think.</p>

		<p>Blacks ARE participating in the economy in a meaningful way.  For instance, they keep liquor stores, drug cartels and the manufacturers of expensive wheel rims in business, and their actions help keep insurance rates high.  They drive whites to purchase far more firearms and ammunition than we otherwise would, and their destruction of what were once nice neighborhoods improves the income of the developers who build new subdivisions for us whites to move to.</p>
<p>Black-on-white crime drove me to rearm to the extent I legally could, which first meant an electromagnetic coilgun.  Since it isn&rsquo;t legally a &#8220;gun&#8221;, it also isn&rsquo;t legally a &#8220;machinegun&#8221;.    Necessity being the mother of invention, I owe monsters like those who abused and killed the young Knoxville couple a debt of gratitude in this respect.  Think of it!  They&rsquo;re not only participating in the economy, but are also actually driving engineering innovation!</p>
