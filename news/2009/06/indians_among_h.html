			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Natasha Chaku, PTI (Melbourne), June 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Indian students have been placed in the high risk group for visa breaches in Australia along with Bangladeshis and Cambodians, a development that may result in tightening of immigration rules for them.</p>
<p>Based on a review of the student visa programme by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship across all applicant countries, Indians were bracketed with Bangladeshis and Cambodians as a &#8216;level-four&rsquo; risk, which is the second highest risk category.</p>
<p>The student visa programme assessment level was raised from three to four after last year&rsquo;s review by the Immigration department. No nationalities have currently been placed at level-five, the highest risk category.</p>
<p>Experts say the upgrade may result in significant tightening of rules for Indian students and can affect the demand for their enrolments.</p>
<p>Under the new measure, Indians seeking education in Australia, will now have to prove they have enough funds to survive for the duration of their study and pass more stringent English language tests.</p>
<p>Immigration risk levels for Indian students were upgraded after a department audit that found that in 2006-07, 4.66 per cent of the 58,268 Indian nationals granted visas breached their conditions, compared with an average rate among foreign students of 1.32 per cent, an Immigration department said.</p>
<p>The number of Indian students studying in Australia has risen dramatically in recent years, from 11,313 in 2002 to 96,739 last year, Immigration department spokesperson added.</p>
<p>In 2007-08 the unlawful rate among Indian students was 1.48 per cent of a total 87,145 Indian visa-holders, compared with 0.99 per cent for the average foreign student.</p>
<p>While in May this year offshore applications for Indian students grew by 20 per cent as compared to last year, statistics for this month have till date remained the same as compared to June last year despite the attacks on Indian students being widely publicised.</p>
<p>The number of Indian students enrolled in Australia stood at 47,639 in the period between July 2007 to June 2008. The number was 38,162 in the period between July 2008 to February 2009.<br>

		<p>Asians represent four-fifths of the world&rsquo;s population.  They&rsquo;ve exceeded their optimal ratio of humans to cultivable soil and potable water.  Most of Asia sufferes from typical Third World lack of economic opportunities.</p>
<p>Over-population drives them to encroach on other people&rsquo;s lands. They&rsquo;ve moved into Fiji, Ceylon, Africa, Malaysia, and the Caribbean, and are at present stepping up their colonization of white countries. </p>

		<p>Adding to anon&rsquo;s comment; India&rsquo;s birth rate is also beyond replacement 2.76, Bangladesh 3.1. There was an article at vdare comparing different racial birth rates in the UK and again Indians exceed whites and Orientals.<br>

		<p>Once again aliens cheating the system. They make it seem easy so it must be. True, they were caught this time, but now what happens to the thousand or so illegal aliens now in UK thanks to their crime and joining all the others such as asylum seekers, over stayers, fake students, marriage scammers, child brides and trafficked african child slaves. Quote from the case report&hellip; &#8216;Prosecutor Francis Sheridan said the case presented a &#8220;damning indictment&#8221; of failures by the UK Border Agency, Home Office and Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner. Home office employees failed to spot that employment certificates from across India were almost identical and that wage slips did not add up. In some cases, students appeared to have attended two full-time courses simultaneously in a bid to boost their credentials. The jury was also told that many people gave the same address and in one case an individual changed sex mid-application.&rsquo; I wonder just who the &#8216;Home Office Employees&rsquo; were?  Surely none had Indian names, did they?</p>

		<p>Indians do this in America as well. It is pretty sad that some law-breakers will affect those who never have the intention to break Australian law in the future. And as the Australian government increases for any reason including immigration restriction, nobody wins including indigenous Australian citizens and White Australians. </p>

		<p>This is good news. I&rsquo;m tired of Indians and Chinese producing millions of kids they can&rsquo;t afford to feed or educate then expecting us to pick up the tab for their irresponsibility.</p>
<p>I notice that many unwanted Chinese and Indian children are adopted by Westerners but never by the wealthy classes in their own countries - why is this, I wonder?</p>

		<p> From my own personal experience of thirty years in academia, I can safely say that few of the South Asian students I&rsquo;ve personally known have ever returned to India or Pakistan. I suspect a significant number have &#8220;jumped&#8221; their visas. I also think that only African students are more likely to overstay their visas. Many Chinese students, particularly women, overstay their visas but less than the other two groups. </p>

		<p>Getting a Visa is the hard part. You just don&rsquo;t go home after it expires. If you&rsquo;re &#8216;enriching&rsquo; America, avoid being deported (while renewing your drivers license every year, etc) for long enough and you become a citizen. </p>

		<p>Australia,America,England and other European nations managed to do quite well without the hindus and sihks. One of the biggest lies of the immigration enthusiasts is that Native Born White Americans and other European people living in European nations will be worse off if the hindus and sihks weren&rsquo;t in European nations. If confronted with this in a debate just say loud and clear:A BOLD FACE LIE. America managed to put 12 Native Born White Men on the moon  before the massive influx into America. </p>
<p>The intent of post-1965 immigration policy is to reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. </p>

		<p>Australia has been described, on vdare.com and elsewhere, as the first society in history in which the elite has knowingly permitted, aided and abetted its own replacement.</p>
<p>The children of the smartest Chinese student-immigrants of today will end up replacing the children of the smartest white Australians in second-level managerial and professional employment. This will probably happen a generation from now.</p>
<p>A generation later, forty or fifty years from now, the grandchildren of the smartest Chinese student-immigrants of today will have a firm grip on the levers of real political power.</p>
<p>On the other hand, smart Chinese have surprisingly low birthrates, as do Jews and Armenians. We&rsquo;ll simply have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Concerning Indian students in Australia, the facts can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>-1-  Innumerable rinky-dink courses at dubious colleges offer diplomas in hair styling and hospitality management.</p>
<p>-2-  Indian students need a flimsy bank guarantee, not real money in their actual hands, to enroll on these courses. They are mainly from smart but cash-strapped families and perforce have to squeeze into low-rent / high-crime areas of Sydney and other Australian cities and necessarily work long hours in any service job like catering or taxi-driving which offers off-the-books employment with few questions asked.</p>
<p>-3-  The real aim of these &#8216;students&rsquo; is to gain legal immigrant status. White Australians seem not to have noticed this.</p>
<p>-4-  There are two kinds of Lebanese immigrants in Australia. The Christians integrate quickly and easily, just as in the USA. </p>
<p>The Muslims do not integrate and many extended clans have become an urban and suburban criminal class hated by everyone else in the Australian population. They also reproduce rapidly.</p>
<p>The least successful members of the least successful Lebanese Muslim crime clans rob Indian students late at night. This was discussed here on AR earlier.</p>
<p>The Bangladeshis and Cambodians have had much the same sort of experiences as the Indians are enduring now, including conflict with the least enterprising and successful of the Lebanese Muslim crime clans.</p>

		<p>Indians are the first to cheat their way into any Western society. Yet, they have the nerve to cry racism and demand action, as we recently saw in Australia, so they can live comfortably in our societies and willy-nilly keep enriching us with their scientific and spiritual genius.</p>

		<p>d: &#8220;This is good news. I&rsquo;m tired of Indians and Chinese producing millions of kids they can&rsquo;t afford to feed or educate then expecting us to pick up the tab for their irresponsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well&hellip; that&rsquo;s what the &#8220;one child policy&rsquo;s&#8221; for isn&rsquo;t it? China&rsquo;s population is actually shrinking at last estimate. The Chinese have low birthrates, they&rsquo;ve merely amassed a large population over a long period, plus their share of the world&rsquo;s population has dropped 5% over the last 200 years.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest here. We all see comments about Asian overpopulation, but the fact is whites were always (and always will) be a global minority. I mean Europe and America along with Australia and NZ doesn&rsquo;t exactly provide the bulk of the world&rsquo;s resources and food does it?</p>
<p>&#8220;I notice that many unwanted Chinese and Indian children are adopted by Westerners but never by the wealthy classes in their own countries - why is this, I wonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually it does happen. In China at least, adoptions are common by the extremely wealthy. But i hear they&rsquo;re not given much love at all, and are merely an excuse for another servant.</p>
<p>Bill Corr: &#8220;The children of the smartest Chinese student-immigrants of today will end up replacing the children of the smartest white Australians in second-level managerial and professional employment.&#8221;</p>
<p>This site has touched upon the success of East Asians many times. And again I say; can we blame them? If they&rsquo;re doing better than us, we should be looking at emulating their positive qualities. It actually makes me happy that immigrants succeed. Those who do succeed in the new country are more likely to be grateful; just look at Charlie Chaplin. We all see people complain of East Asian success, and even more whine about Jewish wealth (esp. now that Australia&rsquo;s 3 richest men are Jews), but instead of complaining, why not interact and understand the roots of their success?</p>
