<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Charles Rangel Friday warned of &#8220;racial polarization&#8221; if Attorney General Andrew Cuomo challenges Gov. Paterson in a primary next year.</p>
<p>Rangel, who is close to the poll-challenged Paterson, ripped Cuomo on New York 1 last night for flatly not ruling out a run for governor next year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Should Cuomo run, Rangel said, it would create a divide that could be &#8220;devastating&#8221; to New York Democrats.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that there might be an inclination for racial polarization in a primary in the state of New York,&#8221; Rangel said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we have most African-Americans registered as Democrats, and since you would be making an appeal for Democrats, it would be devastating in my opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cuomo stirred the ire of black leaders in 2002, when he mounted a primary challenge against Carl McCall, who was looking to become the state&rsquo;s first black governor.</p>
<p>Cuomo wound up pulling out days before the contest and spent the next several years rebuilding his relationship with the party.</p>
<p>A number of Democrats don&rsquo;t believe there will be a primary. They say if Paterson&rsquo;s poll numbers, which are at historic lows, don&rsquo;t improve, he might simply step aside.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rangel also knocked President Obama for getting involved in the U.S. Senate race by asking Rep. Steve Israel (D-L.I.) not to challenge Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.</p>

								<h2>Obtuse Rangel: Charlie Is Wrong to Inject Race Into Gov. Paterson&rsquo;s Reelection Contest</h2>
						<p>
							<i>New York Daily News, June 9, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Rep. Charles Rangel warns of &#8220;racial polarization&#8221; if Attorney General Andrew Cuomo challenges Gov. Paterson in a primary next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we have most African-Americans registered as Democrats, and since you would be making an appeal for Democrats, it would be devastating, in my opinion,&#8221; said Rangel.</p>
<p>This shot comes from someone who, last we checked, is black  &mdash;  yet who pulled out all stops for Hillary Clinton in battling for the Democratic nomination against the man who became the first black President.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But now, Rangel portrays black voters as racially programmed automatons. Which they are not.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rangel, fresh off welcoming President Obama to New York by joking about how black men are likely to get shot by police, is increasingly looking like a dinosaur in the Land of the Lost when it comes to race relations.<br/>

		<p>Silly politicians!</p>
<p>All those years of pandering &amp; truckling to minorities, especially Blacks,does seem to be taking its toll on White Democrats.</p>
<p>The expectation that Whites would remain in control of the increasingly Black &amp; brown Democrat Party, as Whites deserted the Dems in droves due in large part to the race-baiting favoritism shown minorities by the party leadership, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working out as planned.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you agree, President Hillary?</p>

		<p>I heard that two moderate Democrats switched parties to give the State Senate back to Republicans in NY.  Though I don&rsquo;t know what good it will do, Republicans ran the NYS Senate for a long time, one of their members became Governor for 12 years in the person of George Pataki; this didn&rsquo;t prevent NYS from being one of the bluest in the Union, nor having some of the most left-wing policies.</p>
<p>Paterson, Cuomo, Giuliani. Tweedledee, tweedledum.</p>

This topic comes up a good deal on local black talk radio.</p>
<p>Once you go black, you&rsquo;re not allowed to go back.</p>
<p>Yes, blacks believe once they gain power, that power is theirs forever and no one has a right to challenge them or take it away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often surprised and shocked that they can &#8216;lose power&rsquo;; as if it&rsquo;s not supposed to happen.</p>

		<p>so let&rsquo;s see. a white man cannot get a job because by doing so he disenfranchises a black man, a white man cannot speak honestly on race because by doing so he offends a black man, and now a white man cannot run for public office because by doing so he offends AND disenfranchises black people. what&rsquo;s next? by breathing will we be robbing blacks of oxygen? will white people be shamed for marrying other whites instead of blacks and there by not contributing to the balkanization, i&rsquo;m sorry i mean diversifying of america?</p>

		<p>As I stated previously on another thread, Paterson&rsquo;s popularity in the polls is the lowest in NYS history.  When Democrat voters are telling pollsters they would rather have Eliot Spitzer (the guy who was forced to resign in disgrace) back rather than this clown, you know the party is over.</p>

		<p>As a Repub, I endorse Charlie&rsquo;s telling Cuomo not to challenge Paterson in a primary.  Paterson should represent the Dems in the general election.   That would ensure that the next NY governor would be a Republican.   However, we shouldn&rsquo;t sell Charlie too short, he cheated on his  taxes for years and is still Chair of Ways and Means.  </p>

		<p>White liberals can pander to blacks all they want but when blacks have a chance to vote for an actual black person, they&rsquo;ll do it every time   &mdash;   as Hillary learned in the presidential election.  What no politician ever tries to do is get the white male vote.  Not even the white male politicians want our vote.</p>

		<p>Sbuffalonative is correct; blacks think it is &#8220;racist&#8221; for a white to run for office against a black.</p>
<p>IIRC before the &#8216;08 election Rep. John Lewis (D-Georgia) compared McCain and Palin to George Wallace because they stood in the way of a black man becoming president just as Wallace stood in a school doorway to prevent black students from entering.</p>

		<p>If Barack Obama had lost the election, shortly thereafter-like the next day-several White Males across America would have been murdered by black males. I will say this with 100 percent certainty. There were threats of violence on the eve of the election. In fact let us be honest. Blacks would have engaged in a full-blown revolt. These initial murders of a handfull of White Males would have triggered a White backlash. The conflict would have escalated into a full blown race war.</p>
<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s election is so manifestly about race.</p>
<p>If Native Born White Americans foolishly allow themselves to become a racial minority within the borders of America, they will experience extreme discrimanation and racial violence. Blacks and post-1965 non-whites are demanding that Native Born White Americans commit racial suicide. WE are under no obligation to do this.</p>
<p>This is the context in which Charles Rangels comments should be understood.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying this all along.  Republicans catering to minorities is foolish and only offers a safety valve for the Democrats to get rid of some of their people of color.  In this last election, White Democrat votes accounted for a mere 60% towards the election of Obama.  At most, maybe one or two election cycles left before minorities dominate the party.  At that point the liberal progressive agenda folds and is replaced by race based politics based on a black, brown and yellow coalition to rail against Whitey.<br/>

<p>Sorry, thus far the Dems haven&rsquo;t even mentioned a black candidate to replace Paterson.  All of them have been White.</p>
<p>What do Muslims have to do with this election?  The bulk of the Muslims I&rsquo;ve met here in New York City (Arabs, Afghanis, Iranians &amp; Berbers, anyway) despise blacks just as much as Whites do.</p>

		<p>Mario Cuomo, Andrew&rsquo;s father, as Governor called the members of the NRA, &#8220;Drunks who cheat on their wives&#8221; and it went down hill from there. Outdoing his father in going after the NRA and the 2nd Amendment Andrew started SUING gunmakers. It would have bankrupted all the small businesses who make firearms, they had limited resources while the US government has unlimited $$$.<br/>

		<p>It&rsquo;s becoming ever more apparent that the US is heading toward a partitioning into racial enclaves. I&rsquo;m beginning to think that it may be the only way to avoid a civil war. <br/>
This delusional psychotic freak who attacked the Holocaust Museum  and killed the security guard yesterday gave the Left and the MSM the opportunity to annoint him the hero of everyone who considers themselves to be conservative. The word conservative has now become synonymous with right wing white supremecist extremist. The most used word all over the radio this morning was &#8220;hate&#8221;; translate that &#8220;white hate&#8221;. Forget&#8221;Irreverends&#8221; Wright and Jackson, &#8220;Professor Kambon&#8221;, Quannel X and a host of others who call for the killing of Whites and whose calls are beign answered every day on the streets of our cities. <br/>

		<p>To Sonny:</p>
<p>The idea of blacks remaining in power &#8220;forever&#8221; may seem troubling to you, because you are living in a republic with a democratic form of government. Such a concept is unknown to blacks in Africa, who, once they gain power, are &#8220;president for life&#8221; - or until they are overthrown in military coups. To wit:</p>
<p>Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana, Ahmed Sekou Toure in Guinea, Idi Amin in Uganda, Kenneth Kaunda in Zambia, Jean Bedel-Bokassa in the Central African Republic, etc.</p>
<p>This idea of &#8220;leader for life&#8221; is imbued in blacks in this country as well. It just originated in their motherland across the pond.</p>
