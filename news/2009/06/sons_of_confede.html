<h1>Sons of Confederate Veterans Raise Battle Flag</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Claire Galofaro, Bristol (Tennessee) Herald Courier, June 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Sons of Confederate Veterans raised a confederate battle flag Saturday evening in Bristol, Tenn. The 25-by-15-foot banner was hoisted on a 70-foot pole on a hillside in clear view of Interstate 81  &mdash;  to serve as a monument and memory to those who fought on behalf of the South.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 200 people gathered for the ceremony, semi-circled around the pole on top of a hillside several hundred above the interstate. A dozen or so men dressed as confederate soldiers and among them was a black man named H.K. Edgerton.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most discriminated against person in America is the Christian Southern white man,&#8221; said Edgerton, a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and a former president of the NAACP&rsquo;s Asheville, N.C. branch.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This place should be full of black folks,&#8221; Edgerton said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know why [I&rsquo;m the only one here]. Maybe your newspaper should have told them to come to celebrate and sing Dixie and salute our flag. It&rsquo;s a shame white folks and black folks make people think this is an evil flag. This is a southern flag. You can&rsquo;t attack this flag and call yourself a southerner. You can call yourself a traitor.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Sons of Confederate Veterans is an national organization dedicated to protecting the honor of their ancestors. All are great-great-somethings of a confederate soldier, and they look to the flag as a symbol of that fight.</p>
<p>To many others the Confederate flag is America&rsquo;s most contentious symbol, likened to a swastika in hateful significance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pre-raising ceremony Saturday included opening remarks and many who attended exchanged certificates of appreciation. Among the presenters was Sheila Hunt, director of the Sullivan County Archives and Tourism, who offered the gratitude of the mayor of Sullivan County.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I represent four and a half million black folks who&rsquo;ve been beat down and would love to be here, too,&#8221; Edgerton said. &#8220;If they tell you they wouldn&rsquo;t be, the first thing you ask is where they&rsquo;re from. Then you tell them to go on back.&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>The most discriminated against person in America is the Christian Southern white man.</i></p>
<p>A sad commentary on the state of American men that a black man speaks up for them when so few of them stand up for themselves.  Of course, being black is a legally and culturally privileged position in this country so it&rsquo;s much easier for him to say, but it&rsquo;s still pathetic.</p>

		<p>Yes, it is very very true that the most discriminated against group is the Southern white male.  As a Southerner myself (woman), I can strongly agree with that.  And in many ways our worst enemy is the liberal Northern white man.  </p>
<p>Trust me, as more Northerners move South, I notice the hatred and abuse that comes out of their mouths all the time.  What disgusts me is that they bash the South, but yet they choose to live down here.  Does this make sense to anybody?  To me it is hateful, disgusting, and hypocritical.  </p>
<p>A lot of the stereotypes directed at Southern whites aren&rsquo;t even accurate.  A lot of people up North seem to think that we are all barefooted rednecks.  This attitude is so innaccurate that it is almost ignorant to even believe it.  </p>
<p>First of all, rednecks are found in just about every state in the nation.  Second of all, if you want to compare the upper middle and upper classes of each region of the country, the South&rsquo;s is actually the classiest of them all.  We teach our children to say &#8220;sir&#8221; and &#8220;mam&#8221;.  We teach boys to grow up and treat women like ladies.  We teach girls to grow up and act like ladies.  We have some of the most feminine and proper acting women in the nation.</p>
<p>Another stereotype is that we are ugly in appearance.  Well, I better not even touch on that one.  I am going to make too many people mad on here.</p>
<p>I am not posting this to be divisive.  The North has its own interesting culture and I have met many great people from up there.  But, if you had to put up with the bitter hatred that my people have to put up with day in and day out&hellip;.the way we are portrayed in movies etc&hellip;. you would be quite angry right now also.  I have just run into one too many white Northerners who have the most vile and hateful attitude of the South (but yet they STILL move down here).</p>
<p>Go back home to your wonderful Northern &#8220;paradise&#8221; if you hate us so much down here.  We can do just fine without you.</p>

		<p>Well, a good and decent black man who&rsquo;s just telling the truth.  No surprise he&rsquo;s a southerner.</p>
<p>At least you folks in the South have a flag you can call your own.  I&rsquo;m a Yankee, and the only flag I have is the Stars and Stripes.  I&rsquo;d <i>like</i> to be proud of it, but today it represents a bankrupt and corrupt empire that has shredded its own Constitution and despises above all, white men, southern and otherwise.</p>

		<p>In response to Courtney; I don&rsquo;t know much about the North, but I can say that informed, intelligent, and freedom-loving westerners have great respect and love for our similarly endowed brothers and sisters in the South.  Keep flying your battle-flag and keep up the good fight.</p>

		<p>Funny thing, I have always felt outcast in all communities as a White, with ancestors from both sides of the Mason/Dixon Line, because I am a non-believer.  Still, I am convinced that the stubborn, uncompromising attitude that only guarantees future failure is represented by Whites who can only look backwards.</p>

		<p>   I agree with you Courtney but it must be mentioned that we have a lot of good Copperheads up North . Mathew Sandel has a good tape out on his experiences at a parochial school he attended in New England way back there, it&rsquo;s a very good piece on the subject of the Civil War then and now and the unraveling of our civilization, something both the Romans and Greeks went through . Attending school in S/W Georgia in the 50&rsquo;s we sang both Dixie and the Battle Hymm of the Republic . I liked both songs . IF you watch WW2 era and postwar movies the Confederate flag was for the most part, treated with respect.Even up into the early nineties it was portrayed in movies in a non-negative manner .I have cards, purchased from antique shops,from Northerners passing through the South in the 30&rsquo;s, the hostility was not there . The nation is being divided, probably on purpose . My theory is, that it is the result of the tidalwave of immigration that arrived after WW2 . The nation is basically divided into two groups now, those whose roots are in Colonial and Frontier America (45% ?) and those who arrived after WW2 (55% ?).These two groups see America very differently, basically these two groups make up your liberals vs conservatives . And for the first time in our history, the conservatives seem to be losing . Unfortunately many young whites on both sides of the Mason/Dixon line are buying into the extreme lefts agenda .   </p>

Try being a white South African male. Not only are we being discriminated against now that we are under a communist black government, but we have been vilified and demonised for many decades for knowing various truths that the rest of the (liberal) world was not ready to hear, but are learning very fast.</p>

		<p>Courtney, as a New Englander, I agree with you 100%.  I hate the negative attitudes I hear up here about Southerners. I&rsquo;ve never noticed such animosity in the other direction.  And as for the &#8220;redneck&#8221; stereotype, I can assure you that there are MANY rednecks up this way  &mdash;    &mdash;  go to New Hampshire, Worcester County in central Mass., parts of Vermont and Maine, and one will see lots of them.  Yet you have these leftwing whackos in Cambridge and similar places who sip espresso and talk about &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;tolerance&#8221;, and at the same time saying degrading things about Southerners.  It&rsquo;s truly nauseating.</p>

		<p>The nedia portrayal of southerners as stupid has been highly effective.  In movies and TVs they are always portrayed as nitwits, reference the Beverly Hillbillies.  Shows such as Andy Griffith were an exception.  The same thing is being done to white males.  They are being portrayed as stupid buffoons.  White male southerners get it two ways.  We need to start making our own movies and shows and distributing them over the internet.  Film a play and sell it.  Write a play and film it.  I&rsquo;d rather have a technically inferior movie with a good story than the white and southern hating movies out of Hollywood.</p>

<p>Or a German-American.  Or German-German.  There is no other group more stigmatized in North America than Germans.  Every video game, movie or TV show seems geared towards killing Germans in effigy.   Name another ethnicity or race (try finding WWII games where you kill Japanese or any Civil War video games) that is so specifically targeted.</p>

<p>I find your post sadly true and I would like to add - if I may, some perhaps background info on this strange condition that I stumbled upon during my personal genealogical studies (over ten years of it).</p>
<p>Anyone who reads my obnoxious posts for over the several years I have been posting might remember the one where I mentioned my descent from both Upper NY Quebecois and being related as a distant cousin to Robert E Lee (via relationship to his mother Anna Hill Carter - Lee).  I have sympathy for all, but do not turn myself from facts or strong evidences when I find them - on any subject.  That is because I am dedicated to finding the truth of matters rather than preserving any &#8220;sacred cows&#8221; - with the exception of wishing to see the White race survive.</p>
<p>I had a great, great uncle who served, along with many other in the region of Cornwall, Ontario and Messena, NY - in the 6th New York Heavy Artillery.  I found several newspaper clips detailing for example the exit of the Union Army from Washington, DC towards Pennsylvania in 1863.  One item I found was the words to a song that unit used to sing.  The words reveal what I must take as a prevailing attitude among many to set off to war from New England.  The song claims not one care for &#8220;Blacks&#8221; (I insert &#8220;Blacks&#8221; as another now forbidden word was actually used), but a hatred for Southern ways.  This and other historical research has left me with the impression that many Northerners suffered from having inherited a self-righeousness from the early Puritan settlers as well as a dour work ethic that denies any joy of life.  Also, New England had for some time by then been the site of the American Industrial Revolution.  Failed farm families had the &#8220;advantage&#8221; of finding work at factories, but their lot was worse than the slaves of the South.  Entire families worked 16 hour days, ate company food and lived in company dorms with all costs deducted from lousy pay that insured they would never escape the clutches of the corporation, except through death.  On top of that, there were no safety laws or consideration for children.  Women and children with long hair often were scalped, sometimes far down their backs.  Limbs were broken, internal injuries were sustained - all with not one consideration for the victims.  The useless worker was simply shown the door, or helped to it, where their family might be able to save them.  But they more often buried them.  The wealthy New Englanders who had grown fat on these, their disadvantaged fellow Whites assuaged their guilt by engaging in the growing abolisionist movement, preached by Methodist Ministers and other &#8220;intellectuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since colonial times there had been a bit of a squabble between the dour Boston style New Englander and the live loving, philosophical minded wealthy plantation owner culture that actually managed to employ the same Christianity that produced such blind self-righteousness in the North to produce a more often kind, gentile class of people.  Although its time was ending, we all know that more often than not, slaves had conditions that were not inhumane, etc., especially if we compare them to poor White factory workers who were virtual slaves, hardly ever even saw the light of day but were subject to the abuses (read - sexual) of bosses and supervisors more often (from what I gathered) than the slaves in the South (save the use of a whip).</p>
<p>All this and more have provided me with a view that seems to explain that the Northern hatred for the South was due to jealousy and resentment.  Jealousy of the luxury that they denied themselves and the leisure that far fewer Northerners enjoyed.  But it is the absence of that personal-cultural ability to enjoy life that they seem to hate the most.  I think a great deal of what you often notice today in Northerner attitude towards Southerners is rooted in much of this at least.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there is nothing to legitimately criticize about Southern Whites, but that is not the subject of this post.  I probably do that enough in other posts when I attack the tendancy among Southerners of playing into the hands of its detractors by insisting on unreasonable and unsupportable dogmatic imagery and attitudes.</p>
<p>If we were all a bit better at self-criticism and the ability to reconstitute ourselves, there might be some hope of uniting Whites for the purpose of our own survival.  Identifying and eliminating pettiness like this would be a great help, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree?</p>

<p>WOW! Certainly a person who has brains enough to understand the REAL MEANING behind the Southern Flag&hellip; that it was not a symbol of slavery and oppression as Blacks generally demand us to believe&hellip; but the symbol for which a lot of brave men fought and died for&hellip; the right of self-determination for the seceded states.</p>

		<p>The Town of Jonesborough is in the process of building a Veterans Memorial.  Citizens can purchase bricks and have inscribed the names of family and/or relatives who fought in any war from the Revolutary War to the present.  However, there was on glich.  The Johnson City Press reported on Saturday, June 6, 2009, that Jonesborough WOULD NOT accept applications for the purchase of bricks that would have the names of Confederate Veterans inscribed on them.  They did, however, accept the names of two (2) Union soldiers.  A federal law passed in 1906 expressly says that the names of ALL military veterans from the Revolutary War until the present had the right to have their names inscribed on a memorial dedicated to Veterans.  The Mayor of Jonesborough and the City Council were contacted by an outside legal defense team who requested that the purchase of bricks for Confederate veterans for the memorial be accepted.  </p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s JOhnson City Press reports that the Town of Jonesborough has agreed to accept the purchase of the bricks.  Although the Town Attorney, who researched the issue says that there is no precedent that specially says that any city or town must accept the names of Confederate soliders.  He was going to approach the Veterans Administration with this issue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say this a huge win for Southerns who are tired of having their heritage trampled on by a bunch of scared bureaucrats.</p>

And there were/are a lot of them, almost all German-Americans who lived in the Confederacy fought for the Confederacy, even though most of them opposed slavery because they didn&rsquo;t like blacks and their inefficient ways.</p>
<p>German-American societies today far overplay the German-American opposition to slavery, and also misrepresent it in egalitarian terms.  The reason for that is to assuage Hitler guilt.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think they had any guilt, because if they did, they would not have subjected their workers to quasi-slavery.  Their financing and peddling the &#8220;abolitionist&#8221; movement was as much self-serving greed as their harsh treatment of workers.  The reason is that the NY/NE industrial elite could not compete with the greater economies of scale of the British mfgrs.  Therefore, the wanted high tariffs so that the American consumer wouldn&rsquo;t gravitate towards the cheaper British goods.  In contrast, the Southern agrarian cash crop elite needed no tariffs so that they could sell cotton through the whole world w/o fear of trade retaliation.  </p>
<p>Free slave labor was a big part of the reason why cotton and other crops were so profitable, and these profits were turned into dominating the American national body politic from 1800-60, and that dominance meant no or low tariffs.  The growing mfgrs in NE/NY blew up the abolitionist balloon because ending the South&rsquo;s free labor meant ending their farms&rsquo; profitability, and therefore its ability to buy National power, and the end of low tariffs.</p>
<p>Elites and plutocrats often use and abuse social movements for their own ends.  This is similar to how the feminist movement became an overnight force in the 1960s.  It&rsquo;s not that corporate America agreed with the tenets of feminism, all they cared about was increasing the number of people in the labor force, which meant lower wages and salaries.</p>

		<p>My ancestors came from Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, and Italy around 1900, and we&rsquo;ve mostly stayed in Western Pennsylvania, so it seems I have no dog in this fight.</p>
<p>I will, however, say this, which I&rsquo;ve said before and I&rsquo;ll say again:</p>
<p>Why, oh why, do the NAACP, ACLU, SPLC, and whatnot get so up in a tizzy over a flag when they&rsquo;ve got more important things to worry about, like illegitimacy, illiteracy, criminality, and the gangsta culture? Could you imagine how much energy is wasted here? </p>
<p>But attacking a 145-year-old inanimate object is so much easier than taking baby daddies to task to raise their kids or to get wannabe gangstas to put down the guns and pick up the books. </p>
<p>Oh, and a word to fellow Italians: Don&rsquo;t let what&rsquo;s happening to Confederate heritage happen to Christopher Columbus (Oh, wait, it already is!)</p>

		<p>Whiteplight - that was an excellent post.</p>
<p>The South was fighting for freedom against Yankee tyranny and  attempts by the North to impose their way of life (industrialism, urbanity, etc) on the South.</p>
<p>Read the introduction to the famous Southern book I&rsquo;LL TAKE MY STAND for a good refutation of the Northern way-of-life; here&rsquo;s a link to it - <a href="https://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma01/White/anthology/agrarian.html" rel="nofollow">https://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma01/White/anthology/agrarian.html</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Southerner with deep ancestral (Colonial Era) roots in the Carolinas, and I currently live in North Carolina near the border with South Carolina.  Over the past 10-15 years I&rsquo;ve seen Northerners flock here by the hundreds of thousands, if not millions.  They have sullied our landscape with their ugly subdivisions and chain retail stores/restaurants.  They have clogged our streets and dirtied our air with their increased traffic.  They have overburdened our water systems with their overconsumption.  They also act very arrogantly, rudely, and tersely toward us native Southerners.  I understand that this new &#8216;Yankee invasion&rsquo; has also occurred in many parts of Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, and of course Florida.</p>
<p>And what do you know?  Ever since this new &#8216;Yankee invasion,&rsquo; the state of NC and some other states have suddenly become a lot more &#8216;liberal,&rsquo; so much so that NC and VA actually went for Obama in the last election!  The ONLY reason this happened is because of the massive influx of Northerners - only this tipped the balance in favor of the Democrats here.</p>
<p>However, it is clear that this huge influx of Northerners in the past 1-2 decades has made the parts of the South which have seen the largest increase of these people MUCH worse. </p>

		<p>Interesting to note that, after the War ended, so very few of those Northern soldiers who came South to free the black man from slavery chose to take black men back North with them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;15 Anonymous  &mdash;  Try being a German-Southerner, the two most hated types of whites on Earth. And there were/are a lot of them, almost all German-Americans who lived in the Confederacy fought for the Confederacy, even though most of them opposed slavery because they didn&rsquo;t like blacks and their inefficient ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an interesting point, but I don&rsquo;t really think of Germans as making up a noticeable percentage of the South.  Most Southerners are Scotch-Irish, English, or even French.  I know that certain parts of the South have more Germans than others.  Does anybody know which areas are heavily populated by Germans in the South?  I hardly know of any in the area I am from.</p>

		<p>Eman, I understand where you are coming from.  I live in Alabama and my family has been in this state forever and ever.  </p>
<p>I run into people all the time here who have adopted the accents and everything, but then I find out later that their parents came down here from New York.  It is sickening to me.  It isn&rsquo;t just their way of life, but how they look etc&hellip; everything sets them apart from the true waspy Southerners like me who live here.  You can easily pick them out whether they have the accents or not. They aren&rsquo;t Southerners to me and they never will be.</p>
<p>Just like you, I trace my heritage back to the Revolution and my ancestors (Scotch-Irish) have been in my state (Alabama) ever since it was a territory.  The South is unique in that most of the whites here trace their ancestory back to this nation&rsquo;s founding.  You can&rsquo;t say the same about the Midwest or the Northeast etc&hellip;.  This is another reason I am tired of seeing transplants from other parts of the nation pollute this pristine area.  </p>
<p>If you are a Northerner reading this who is thinking of relocating down here, can you please reconsider? Please can you all allow at least one part of this nation to remain pure (descended from the founding stock)?????? </p>
<p>I know that there are some of you who are decent people (like those of you who post on here).  But the damage is already done.  Your people are swamping our territory down here, changing it for the worst, and it causes me to have little sympathy for those of you who come down here meaning well.  </p>

<p>They started before the Revolution spilling south out of Pennsylvania Dutch country into the Shenandoah Valley of VA.  Because the Anglos were there first, they got the better land, and the Krauts were stuck with lesser land up against hills.  Still, they were more productive per acre than the Anglo/slave farms.  In a biography about Merriweather Lewis, (can&rsquo;t remember the author), the author describes Lewis&rsquo;s childhood in the Shenandoah Valley, and the German influx.  Anglo elites were worried that here were these Krauts, with no slaves, and in fact opposed to slavery, outproducing the Anglos per acre.  They were paranoid about the Germans, eerie that they would be even more productive with the Anglos&rsquo; land, so they thought that the Krauts would hook up with the black slaves, foment a mini-rebellion, overthrow the Anglo elite, claim the land, and set the black slaves free as a reward.  The flaw with that paranoia is that the Krauts were against slavery because they didn&rsquo;t like blacks, so there was no way they would have sided with them against other white people.</p>
<p>Winston-Salem, N.C. was founded by Moravian Lutherans. </p>
<p>There were enough Germans in South Carolina ante-bellum that Robert E. Lee, in a letter to a Lieutenant after the WBTS, recommended that landowners, who oddly found themselves short of slaves, as slavery was now illegal, and sharecropping had not taken hold yet, to bring in Germans that were in the state, because Lee noticed the Germans&rsquo; productive ways with lesser land.</p>
<p>Not all Germans were opposed to slavery.  The largest ante-bellum cotton farm in Texas was Kraut-owned and used slaves.  The irony of that is that today, the only Texas monument to the Yankee Army is owned and maintained by a German-American society.</p>
