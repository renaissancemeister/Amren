<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Suzanne,&#8221; a female caller to Mark Levin&rsquo;s show on June 25th, revealed the ominous secret of the Democrat health care reform effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to tell you that last week I attended a conference on health care reform sponsored by La Raza. And I will tell you that what they had to say, Mark, is scarier than anything that&rsquo;s been said so far on the health care plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kind of comments that were made and the notes that I took .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they started the conference out by saying &#8216;America does not need health care reform, but Latino immigrants need health care reform.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;And someone from Menendez&rsquo; office [Ed.: Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.] promised that he would make sure that &#8220;the useless barriers of citizenship would not be in this bill&#8221; and that he would make sure that they would use keywords like &#8216;streamline&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was La Raza, the Childrens Defense Fund and Senator Menendez from New Jersey, a representative from his office .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes [they said they would get free health care for illegal aliens], these are my notes, Mark. They actually got up and said &#8216;Latino children need health care more than whites.&rsquo; And then they would say things like &#8216;you must go out into your communities, use words like &#8220;streamline,&#8221; use phrases like &#8220;all workers&#8221; and &#8220;all families,&#8221;&rsquo; because they said  &mdash;  and I quote  &mdash;  &#8216;If the American people find out that this bill is about giving health care to non-citizens, they will rise up against it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the quotes they said was, &#8216;We want to make sure we take care of barriers like verification, but we can streamline programs to the more affluent&rsquo; and, quote, &#8216;Useless treatments for the elderly can be gone because we don&rsquo;t need to spend money for people who are going to die anyway.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s a direct quote from that meeting. They also said, &#8216;We are very concerned there will be an effort to include&rsquo; the illegal immigrants in this argument, so &#8216;we must make sure that we focus this&#8221; to the American people that it&rsquo;s looking like we want &#8220;health care for everyone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they also said that 75% of the children who will be picked up in this will be non-citizens and that 44% of the uninsured are non-citizens and they can&rsquo;t possibly allow the American people to know this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Menendez&rsquo; office said that he&rsquo;s going to make sure that &#8216;a family of four that makes $66,000 a year or less will pay nothing at all for the new health care.&rsquo; And he was the one who said he was going to get rid of specifics like &#8216;citizenship status&rsquo; and focus on, quote, &#8216;equity for all workers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he said he&rsquo;s going to make sure that the Latino immigrants are the focus of the health care reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;And La Raza said if they get this, they don&rsquo;t even care about amnesty, because they&rsquo;ve fixed it so that one family member can apply for all extended family members. And .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mark, if you think we have a problem with illegal immigration now, wait &#8216;til you see the borders when this thing gets passed.&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.nclr.org/content/news/detail/57979/">NCLR Calls for Health Reform That Includes All Workers and Families</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Presss Release, National Council of La Raza, June 15, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
June 15, 2009</p>
<p>Washington, DC  &mdash;  As our nation&rsquo;s leaders consider health care reform in the coming weeks, NCLR (National Council of La Raza), the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States, strongly urges President Obama and Congress to make every effort to ensure that health care reform reaches all communities. <b>No single community stands to gain as much from this important debate as Latinos.</b> [Emphasis added &mdash;Ed.] In the U.S., one out of every three uninsured persons and roughly 40% of all uninsured children are Latino. NCLR stands for health care reform that makes coverage affordable and accessible for everyone  &mdash;  all families and all children.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all use doctors and hospitals for care, so it&rsquo;s right that everyone in the U.S. should contribute to a new health system. Latinos accept their responsibility, and if they have the opportunity, they will pay their fair share for the health coverage they need,&#8221; said NCLR President and CEO Janet Murguía.</p>
<p>NCLR cautions, however, that the positive impact of several reform proposals on the table may be undermined by additional measures that would severely restrict access to health coverage by mandating new, expensive verification and documentation procedures. &#8220;This debate should be about health care for all, and setting the nation on a pathway to future health and well-being. Adding layers of immigrant verification and bureaucratic red tape to a new health care system would guarantee that millions of citizen children are effectively barred from accessing preventive care and would raise the cost of health care,&#8221; Murguía noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;For this reason, we are extremely concerned that some view health reform as a way to scapegoat immigrants,&#8221; Murguía continued. &#8220;We agree that the immigration system needs to be fixed, but address that problem separately through immigration reform. The best way to reduce costs in our health care system is to ensure that people do not have to follow a long paper trail to get to the doctor and that everyone shares the costs of a new system. Making health care easier to use and accessible for all workers and children is simple common sense.&#8221;</p>

		<p>     Why not give free health care to the entire world ? All you have to do is print up a few zillion dollars and everyone will get paid. It isn&rsquo;t that preposterous-just look at what we elected to Congress in November. Al Franken will fit in nicely with all those other clowns. They can compete with each other to see who can author the most outrageously anti-American laws they can dream up. Congressional approval was at its lowest in history just before the November elections and look what happened. The American people returned ninety-five percent of these traitors to office. We deserved what we got. Now live with it, America. Welcome to the third world.</p>

		<p>Health care now accounts for 15% of the entire economy of our country. I have heard that soon it will be 20%.If illegals are included, that 20% will be 25% or more.Hispanics are ruthless in their pursuit of Mexusupremacy.They have no sense of pride. They will suck all of the blood out of us until we,along with them,  are dead, just like some kind of parasite.And for that we can thank the white,wealthy eletist liberals push their agenda because they are comfortable with their wealth and good lifestyle.</p>

		<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>It is beyond clear that the American people are incapable of responding to anything.  The National Council of La Raza can be completely open about its agenda without it mattering one little bit.</p>
<p>The very idea of the American people rising up just makes me laugh.</p>

		<p>Well my friends here at AR, be ready to grab your ankles and have a bus-sized sandpaper suppository rammed up you mercilessly!</p>
<p>Today that Red clown Al Franken, just got his Senate seat and the Democrats now have their 60 vote &ldquo;supermajority.&rdquo; And you can bet your bottom dollar, that we will be progressively lurching toward a country where undocumented &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; are afforded both more &ldquo;rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;redistributed&rdquo; booty, than anyone actually born here without an ebony hide. The abjectly idiotic hogwash documented above about &ldquo;Latinos&rdquo; will be the babblings of infants, once the multicultural sanctimony really starts oozing from that abscess on the Potomac. </p>
<p>The only consolation prize to all of this, is the fact that our &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; country (and subsequently, this whole dementedly kaleidoscopic planet) are going to collapse both financially and politically; this would be because, Marxist fantasies cannot ever substitute for realistic productivity and sanity!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!<br>

		<p>I should hope that Americans will rise up against government health care whether or not it benefits latinos, but then again Cap-and-Trade sailed through the House with little public opposition.  Most people just don&rsquo;t understand how they will be affected by the recent and future anti-middle class legislation.    </p>

		<p>Well, my, my, my&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Useless treatments for the elderly can be gone because we don&rsquo;t need to spend money for people who are going to die anyway.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just this last week my family had a very interesting visit in the E.R. of the local county hospital. We encountered just this sort of attitude out of a Neurology Intern along with a Social Worker.</p>
<p>They decided, absent much work on my Grandmother that it was her time to die I guess after taking some x-rays and looking at her charts.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, she has excellent health insurance, her husband risked his life as an ironwork foreman for 45 odd years to make sure that was covered. Of course we are white citizens. This mattered not at all to them!</p>
<p>They admitted her under &#8220;observation&#8221; status only, saying there was nothing wrong with her that warranted a hospital stay. We pointed out a few obvious things that we had noted and the &#8220;doctor&#8221; agreed but did nothing about them. Then the &#8220;social worker&#8221; said, &#8220;because this is  not a covered medical need&#8221; that the bills would not be covered by Medicare and that her provider follows the Medicare guidelines, so that the nursing home stay would not be covered either.</p>
<p>Very long story short. A few days after checking out of this house of horrors, on a hunch, when we had to readmit her I chose a suburban hospital that has a catholic flavor. Lo and behold, she was basically dying of something minor that we had mentioned to the other &#8220;doctor.&#8221; It is now fixed and we don&rsquo;t have to pay for her room and board at the transitional care facility.</p>
<p>The upshot is that they withheld care at the county hospital and deliberately tried to financially wipe us out using a technicality in the Medicare guidelines!!!</p>
<p>There are anti-abortion picketers who stand outside this hospital each week I think, I&rsquo;d like to contact them for a start. But can any of you think of a way I could &#8220;repay&#8221; this hospital for what they attempted to do to us?</p>
<p>Thank God for sites like this, or I wouldn&rsquo;t be prepared to deal with such evil!!!</p>
<p>Oh, and as a side note, they had my contact information as a name I had previously until I legally changed it 25 years ago along with another relatives phone number. I hadn&rsquo;t seen that name in so long I had to look at it a minute before it even registered. It just never comes up!?!</p>

		<p>The idea behind public health care is good. We&rsquo;ve got it here in Oz, and although some people find it a long wait to get treatment, they get it; and are not forced to take drastic measures (like selling their house). The Government even subsidises our medicine, so an expensive procedure like dialysis only costs $30 a month. All this, and the Government still managed to keep the budget in surplus until this year (although I know the US needs it army more than us). I&rsquo;m sure if everyone pulls their own weight, things will be fine.</p>

		<p>While Caucasian Americans are still the majority, it is theoretically possible to still quell the proposed Health Reform effort, as well as the similar insanenesses, that are being rushed to fruition by ObamaCo.</p>
<p>However, for the very same reason a far left, liberal activist such as Obama got elected in the first place - in a country where, purportedly, conservatives are in the majority - this is highly unlikely to happen. Decades of erosion of independent thought put paid to that. It is a global syndrome.</p>
<p>Take the lead from the events in - The Republic! of - South Africa (RSA) where the Caucasians are now the minority. Watch and learn from their paroxysms. Even if you ignore their overt abuse, the utterly hideous crime rates and general abandon, please do scan the RSA media and study, for instance, the new proposed NHI (National Health Insurance) bill which is under heavy discussion. Its current actions, looming implementation and final results are strikingly similar. Take time too, to study the utterly defunct RSA public/national heath care system.</p>

		<p>And just who is going to pay for this Health care and with what? Fiat money? So its going through with &#8220;cap and trade&#8221; is it? </p>

<p>(1) taxes on everything, with government owning more and more </p>
<p>businesses (you  really think these guys know how to build a </p>

<p>(2) unemployment at over twenty percent;</p>
<p>(3) interest rates at over fifteen percent;</p>
<p>(4) food  shortages, food riots;</p>
<p>(5) housing prices dropping with tent cities rising;</p>
<p>(6) closed businesses everywhere;</p>
<p>(7) crime rates through the stratosphere;</p>
<p>(8) smart money moving to China (you think Jim Rogers is dumb?);</p>
<p>(9) a depression; and,</p>
<p>(10) a another, much larger, War.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes we can&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Change you can believe in&#8221;</p>
<p>Health care? Drop by any emergency room, located in any &#8220;hood&#8221;, </p>

		<p>Well, remember, they have lower than average incomes, especially if you only count what they earn on the books, and they have larger than average numbers of dependents, especially if you count the loved ones back in Mexico.  They are willing to pay their &#8220;fair share&#8221; as long as it is waived due to their low income, or limited to some de minimis amount, such as $2 per month, per &#8220;family&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>If the immigration problem isn&rsquo;t solved in a forceful way, everybody in the whole wide world who has cancer or Aids or organ failure will be sent to the USA by their families.  Even in the third world medical care for a major illness costs more than a plane ticket.  The Asians already dump their elderly, who have never earned a dime in America, or at least never paid taxes on whatever income they have earned in America, onto the Social Security, HUD housing, and Medicaid programs.  The sky&rsquo;s the limit if health care is offered to the &#8220;undocumented.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The American people never responded to thousands of mexicans demonstrating in LA carrying plackards reading &#8220;European go home&#8221; and &#8220;this is our land not yours.&#8221; They don&rsquo;t respond to &gt;35000 rapes of white women by black men that occur annually.

They don&rsquo;t respond to their govenment moving ghetto blacks into their neighborhoods rent &amp; utility free at their expense&hellip;</p>
<p>I think Americans need some leadership. A messianic figure around whom they CAN respond. Any takers?</p>

<p>Typical liberal inversion of reality. Common sense actually tells you that the more people you extend free health care coverage to, the more unsustainable it becomes.</p>

&#8220;The idea behind public health care is good. We&rsquo;ve got it here in Oz, and although some people find it a long wait to get treatment, they get it; and are not forced to take drastic measures (like selling their house). The Government even subsidises our medicine, so an expensive procedure like dialysis only costs $30 a month. All this, and the Government still managed to keep the budget in surplus until this year (although I know the US needs it army more than us). I&rsquo;m sure if everyone pulls their own weight, things will be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Thanks for the input, but I doubt you will ever get through to the conservative Americans who regularly post here.  They are so polarized in their views that even gardening for survival is just too liberal for them to consider.  As a retired doctor who partly retired out of disgust with the for profit health care system in this country - I am saying that we could easily payy for health care for LEGITIMATE AMERICANS if we wanted to if we cut out the graft, fraud (on both ends) and sheer idiocy that leads America to have the most expensive health care system in the world that doesn&rsquo;t even do a good job at delivering it to most of the people.  This is one thing that I am in agreement with Obama.  Where I differ with him is about who should get it.  No nation can allow benefits for anyone who can swindle their way into a nation and survive fiscally very long.  But as it is today, our health care system is even a bigger swindle on the American people than that!  I hope this administration will put 2+2 together (and get 5) before too long.  I also hope some of our conservative lockstep mind grinders will as well.</p>

<p>To the Australian who wrote about Australia&rsquo;s socialized medical care, I would say that the program is only working because you don&rsquo;t share a border with the third world, and you are benefitting from the legacy of the White Australia policy.  If your aboriginals made up 40% of your population, and that percentage was growing, you would be much more fearful of growing old with socialized medicine.</p>

I agree with you.  I have written in the past that in order for a new or future White nation to survive, its members will have to embrace a sort of socialism.  That is because it will be required for replacing and growing the numbers and capitalist style &#8220;every man for himself&#8221; grab it while you can philosophy is going to be the demise of conservatives or any who will need to organize at the basic level.  That is also why I am critical of Whites - posters here (at times) who shun basic survival skills in the here and now, like house gardening and keeping chickens.  This is just as important as owning a few guns and knowing how to use them.  And it isn&rsquo;t like suddenly we can all go off into the local woods and shoot game for supper - let alone imagine that there will still be a Burger King or KFC just down the street.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, this entire mess is going to crash.  I am amazed at the speed that things have been happening for the last 30 years, but especially since the start of the 21st century.  It isn&rsquo;t enough to post complaints and clever observations on a blog.  The future is coming fast and in some respects - it is here.  We must learn to accept eachother (Whites) regardless of petty differences and also the religious ones.  Otherwise, I am sure there will be no White future.</p>

<p>I agree that we have a very expensive healthcare system and there is a lot of fraud and it needs to change. However, socialized medicine is also very expensive, you just pay through your taxes.  However, I personally don&rsquo;t believe socialized medicine is the way to solve this problem. (Canada and the UK have long waits and much higher death rates for serious problems than we do, MRIs that take two years to get, healthcare  rationed by the government.) Anytime government runs anything, well it&rsquo;s often not pretty plus I don&rsquo;t want Big Governement in my healthcare. I think there is another way.</p>
<p>I personally believe in eliminating all this fraud and cost inflation and taking health insurance out of the workplace. Then the government can give people a huge tax cut. People use these taxes returned to them to purchase a private health insurance policy that they can shop around for and tailor for themselves, just like car insurance. Just like care insurance, the few claims, the less expensive your policy is. This  helps eliminate all these people who run to the doctor for a cold. Hospitals must compete for patients and provide statistics such as pricing and cure rates for various illnesses. It is capitalist competition, NOT socialism, that will provide the highest quality. We can still keep medicaid for the poor and medicare for the elderly. For the rest, government insurance should be available only for those who are unemployed temporarily or those uninsured who fall between the cracks and only those that use it should pay a heavy insurance tax for it.</p>
<p>Lastly, like car insurance, all should be required by law to at least have a certain minimun coverage. However, the most important thing should be getting rid of all these fast breeding illegals and third world people. With them, any system will be unaffordable and fail</p>

		<p>The problem with National health care is that the government has a say in what treatments you can or can&rsquo;t get. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the new plan. So they could politicize it and deny care to people they don&rsquo;t like. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already made plain that health care will have to be rationed out under National health care.</p>
<p>And if you got a broken arm, or a cut, then national health care will seem to work great. On the otherhand if someone ended up with cancer, the system won&rsquo;t work fast enough or well enough for them.</p>

<p>You have stated the case precisely. (And the last paragraph is on the mark too.)   My brother, some years ago, drove an ambulance after getting out of the Air Force, and I remember he mentioned  some people (&#8220;minorities&#8221; needless to say)  who called an ambulance for every little thing, even a headache. At that time, it cost a thousand dollars to send an ambulance out.  I thought that was shocking, almost unbelievable.   Recently,  I had an ambulance ride to the ER myself,  which cost me three thousand!  That was JUST for the ambulance alone, nothing else.   I was stunned when I got the bill at the end of the month. (Of course, illegal aliens get this service free. They cannot be denied.)</p>
<p>As you say, some people will take the ambulance just to save the bus fare, just as long as someone else is paying for it.   Socialized health care, as in Denmark or Sweden, is a fine ideal, in principle.  Even in a small town in Minnesota or Iowa.   But sadly, in a multi-racial society where nobody gives a damn about the rest, there are always people who will abuse it.</p>

<p>This brings up something else I&rsquo;ve been thinking about.</p>
<p>European (and by that, I mean whites, not just on the European continent) welfare states were started out of nationalism and tribalism, not universalism and Marxism.  It is said that it was a contradictory thing to do for Otto von Bismarck, a supposedly &#8220;right wing&#8221; leader, to start the world&rsquo;s first welfare state.  But the Bismarck that unified Germany and the Bismarck that provided a welfare state for said Germany were doing the same things for the same reason.  &#8220;Deutschland Uber Alles&#8221; was composed and popularized during the unification period, not as an anthem of world supremacy, but as a clarion call that the interests of German peoples of a whole should be placed above those of your Germanic tribe; Alsacian, Prussian, Moravian, Bavarian, and so on.  So why wouldn&rsquo;t someone who wants Germans to think of themselves as Germans also start a program where younger and more capable Germans make life easier for older and sicker Germans?</p>
<p>In Europe, the further north you go, the bigger the welfare state gets.  Sweden&rsquo;s welfare state is bigger and more generous than Italy&rsquo;s, because Sweden is colder.  Same thing in America, Minnesota&rsquo;s welfare state is bigger than Mississippi&rsquo;s.  Scandinavians love their welfare states.  Mainly because the winters are so long and harsh, you need to &#8220;huddle together&#8221; literally and physically, to survive.</p>
