			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Steyn, Maclean&rsquo;s Magazine (Toronto), June 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To promote a greater sense of Euro-harmony, the European Parliament  &mdash;  actually, make that the European &#8220;Parliament&#8221;  &mdash;  is organized into ideological blocs, ensuring that French liberals sit with Slovene liberals, and Belgian greens sit with Latvian greens, rather than hunkering down in their ethnic ghettoes. The largest bloc is the &#8220;centre-right,&#8221; the second-largest are the socialists, and the third is now the &#8220;non-inscrits,&#8221; the bloc for people who don&rsquo;t want to belong to blocs. As a result of this month&rsquo;s election, this Groucho Marxist grouping of &#8220;Others&#8221; tripled in size to just under a hundred seats. So, if they&rsquo;re not liberals, socialists, greens, &#8220;European democrats&#8221; or the &#8220;Nordic Green Left,&#8221; what the hell are they?</p>
<p>Okay, here goes. The members of the non-bloc bloc include: one member of the &#8220;True Finns&#8221; party; one member of the Slovak National Party; two members of the British National Party; two members of the Austrian Freedom Party; two members of the Vlaams Belang, the &#8220;Flemish Interest&#8221; party; two members of the Civic Union, which sounds like a gay marriage in Vermont but is in fact an offshoot of the Latvian nationalist For Fatherland And Freedom Party; three members of France&rsquo;s National Front; three members of Jobbik, the Hungarian nationalist party; three members of the Greater Romania Party .&Nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Well, you get the picture. The European Parliament isn&rsquo;t exactly working out as Lord Tennyson foresaw:</p>
<blockquote>&#8221;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the war-drum throbb&rsquo;d no longer, and the battle-flags were furl&rsquo;d / In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.
<p>&#8220;There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe / And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.&#8221;</blockquote></p>
<p>A Federation of Euro-harmony filled by ultra-nationalist xenophobes is almost too droll a jest. My favourite of these new national parties is Ataka, which is a Bulgarian word meaning  &mdash;  oh, go on, take a wild guess. That&rsquo;s right: &#8220;Attack.&#8221; What a splendidly butch name. The Attack party was formed from last year&rsquo;s merger of the Bulgarian National Patriotic Party, the Union of Patriotic Forces and the National Movement for the Salvation of the Fatherland, and in nothing flat managed to get 13 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>Like Attack, many of these lively additions to the political scene favour party emblems that slyly evoke swastikas while bending the prongs in different directions just enough to maintain deniability. Other than that, they don&rsquo;t have a lot in common with their colleagues in the no-bloc bloc. I don&rsquo;t just mean in the sense that the leader of the Slovak National Party said a couple of years back, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s all get in tanks and go and flatten Budapest,&#8221; which presumably is not a policy position the Hungarian nationalists in Jobbik would endorse. But there are broader differences, too. The SNP is antipathetic to homosexuals, whereas Krisztina Morvai, the attractive blonde Jobbik member just elected to the Euro-parliament, is a former winner of the Freddie Mercury Prize for raising AIDS awareness. I can&rsquo;t be the only political analyst who wishes that, instead of a victory speech last Sunday, Doktor Morvai had stood on the table in black tights and bellowed out, &#8220;We Are the Champions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like our chums at Canada&rsquo;s &#8220;human rights&#8221; commissions, Doktor Morvai is a &#8220;human rights&#8221; activist  &mdash;  and, indeed, a former delegate to the UN Women&rsquo;s Rights Committee. One thing a woman has a right to is an uncircumcised penis. In the course of her successful election campaign, the good doctor told Hungarian Jews to &#8220;go back to playing with their tiny little circumcised tails.&#8221; I don&rsquo;t know what Krisztina has against circumcised penises, but it&rsquo;s probably not her pelvis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear whether any member of the Austrian Freedom Party has won the Freddie Mercury Prize, but its late leader, JÃ¶rg Haider, wound up pushing up edelweiss eight months ago when he flipped his Volkswagen limo after leaving a gay bar in Klagenfurt somewhat the worse for wear. &#8220;He never helped his family man image by turning up at rallies and local events with an entourage of young blond men,&#8221; reported the Daily Mail. &#8220;Newspapers in his homeland said they were reluctant to publish &#8216;full details&rsquo; of his homosexuality fearing an outburst of hate toward the gay community would overtake hatred towards foreigners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Er, if you say so. So hard to know who to hate first, isn&rsquo;t it? And you&rsquo;ve gotta be able to prioritize.</p>
<p>In Austria&rsquo;s Euro-election, two explicitly anti-immigrant parties won 18 per cent of the vote. In the United Kingdom, meanwhile, the new nationalist vote was divided between the British National Party and the UK Independence Party, which favours British withdrawal from the European Union and managed to elect 13 members to the European Parliament, winning 17 per cent of the vote and pushing Gordon Brown&rsquo;s Labour Party into third place. The two seats won by the BNP represent the first victory in a national election by any British Fascist party, however squishily one cares to define that term. Seventy years ago, under Sir Oswald Mosley, a far more charismatic leader than the BNP&rsquo;s Nick Griffin, the British Union of Fascists never managed to elect a single local councillor.</p>
<p>So the electors of the United Kingdom crossed a dark Rubicon this month. For 40 years, London&rsquo;s Europhile politico-media elites have attempted to impose a &#8220;European identity&#8221; on the masses, condescendingly assuring the British people that they are, indeed, European, they&rsquo;re just too parochial and ill-informed to realize it. Thus the paradox: in its rejection of Europe, the British electorate has never been more European. The Brits have finally got with the program: just like the Continentals, they&rsquo;re voting for fascists.</p>
<p>Woody Guthrie used to have a label on his guitar: &#8220;This Machine Kills Fascists.&#8221; Not true, of course. Just the usual self-flattery to which singing Commies are prone. But, in the room where they cook up European conventional wisdom, they could easily pin a sign on the door saying: &#8220;This Political Machine Creates Fascists.&#8221; One can forgive Bulgaria its wackier demagogues: they are, after all, only two decades removed from one-party totalitarianism. But, in the western half of Continental Europe, politics evolved to the point where almost any issue worth talking about was ruled beyond the bounds of polite society. In good times, it doesn&rsquo;t matter so much. But in bad times, if the political culture forbids respectable politicians from raising certain issues, then the electorate will turn to unrespectable ones. Europe has taken a worse hit than North America in the first crisis of economic globalization: unemployment in Spain, for example, is over 17 per cent. To the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, this &#8220;crisis of capitalism&#8221; is the biggest event since the fall of the Soviet Union. But, if it&rsquo;s a &#8220;crisis of capitalism,&#8221; why did the mainstream Euro-left take the electoral hit rather than the mainstream Euro-right? Instead of turning to socialist parties promising more state booty, voters boosted the fortunes of the neo-nationalists. Many of these groups are economically protectionist (and in some cases more &#8220;left wing&#8221; than, say, the British Labour Party) but they&rsquo;re also culturally protectionist in a way the polytechnic left most certainly isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>On the day of the European elections, the Toronto Sun&rsquo;s Lorrie Goldstein responded to my observations about his recent column accusing Tamilphobic Canadians of racism. &#8220;I wish,&#8221; sighed Mr. Goldstein, &#8220;Steyn would spend more time disagreeing with what racists say and less time defending their right to say it.&#8221; But that&rsquo;s kind of a crowded market for a pundit to get a piece of the action in. I mean, Canada surely doesn&rsquo;t need one more delicate flower shrieking &#8220;Racism!&#8221; at every affront to the multiculti pieties. That hypersensitivity is what&rsquo;s helped deliver more and more of the European vote to &#8220;fringe&#8221; parties. You want to talk about immigration? Whoa, racist! Crime? Racist! Welfare? Racist! Islam? Racistracistdoubleracist!!! Nya-nya, can&rsquo;t hear you with my two anti-racist thumbs in my ears!</p>
<p>Already, the European political class is congratulating itself at holding the tide of neo-nationalism to the low double-digits. I&rsquo;d say some of these results are pretty remarkable given that these parties are all but excluded from the public discourse and that even a relatively mild dissenter from the consensus such as the Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders has been banned from setting foot in Britain and is undergoing prosecution for his views in the Netherlands. What makes the Labour Party &#8220;mainstream&#8221; with 15 per cent of the vote and UKIP the &#8220;fringe&#8221; with 17 per cent? Nothing, other than the blinkers of the politico-media class. But if you want to drive the electorate toward the wilder shores in ever greater numbers, keep crying &#8220;Racist!&#8221; at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Things are not going to get any prettier in the next European electoral cycle. Aside from professions of &#8220;horror&#8221; at the success of the neo-nationalists, there is now talk of shutting down these parties by using the legal system (as was done in Belgium) or by denying them the public funding to which their share of the vote entitles them. Subverting democracy to suppress neo-nationalism doesn&rsquo;t seem a smart move. But then if the political class were that smart it wouldn&rsquo;t be in this situation. The problem in Europe is not a lunatic fringe but a lunatic mainstream ever more estranged from its voters.<br>

		<p>I notice he doesn&rsquo;t spend much time saying WHY the &#8220;fascists&#8221; are winning in Europe like the title promises, just a lot of disbelief and doom &amp; gloom (from his perspective that is - this is cause for celebration for us!)   </p>

		<p>Wonderful lucid piece! And MacLean&rsquo;s Magazine is Canada&rsquo;s Time Magazine. I hope there is still a Europe left to save when their political elite finally awake. As someone better disposed towards a UKIP approach, rational national and ethnic self-determination, than the darker alternatives, I speak up in public when I hear the old benighted platitudes. This has caused some discmfort, but I have lost my patience and want the dawn to break  &mdash;  soon. And I know chanting falsehoods will not alter reality, so I choose the clear light of evidence against the fans of obscurantism  &mdash;  left and right.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m really disappointed in Mark Steyn here.  He is doing to European nationalist parties what the kook left in Canada is doing to him.</p>
<p>I also object to the bromide that the lamestream parties (especially lamestream conservative parties) are somehow failures such that parties like the BNP can win MEP seats.  Robert Spencer over at Jihad Watch does the same thing.  But after years and years of people like Mark Steyn and Robert Spencer poodling for lamestream conservative parties, the Republicans, Tories, and various Christian Democrats in Europe, it hasn&rsquo;t amounted to a hill of beans when it comes to stopping our own dispossession.  The problem isn&rsquo;t that lamestream conservative parties are failing, the problem is that they are succeeding, with their neo-conservative, neo-egalitarian predatory capitalist economic determinist ideology.  Actions have consequences.</p>
<p>Mark Steyn is going to be sub for Rush on Monday.  I used to like to listen to him, no more.</p>

		<p>The writer of this article is extremely biased and ill-informed. Calling nationalists like the BNP fascists shows the writers liberal/neo-Marxist credentials. It&rsquo;s just a pity he didn&rsquo;t take time to analyse the neo-Marxist elite who control the EU and he would certainly have found plenty of totalitarians of the Red variety. Just a few of the many he would have discovered are EU Commission President Manuel Barroso, who led a Marxist party in Portugal, but incredibly this lifelong Marxist is the leader of the centre-right grouping in the EU. Daniel &#8216;Dany the Red&rsquo; Cohn-Bendit, former leader of the 1968 Paris student riots, but this lifelong Marxist, now in his sixties, is a German Green MEP and leader of the Green grouping in the EU Parliament (Green is the new Red). Lifelong Marxist Martin Schulz, German Socialist MEP is chairman of the Socialist grouping in the EU Parliament. So it seems that Mr. Steyn finds no lack of democracy in the fact that in the EU apart from the Nationalist parties, no matter who you vote for, you&rsquo;ll get a Marxist totalitarian calling the shots, whether you&rsquo;ve voted for it or not. The appointed not elected EU Commissioners (the real power in the EU) are almost all neo-Marxist to a man/woman, while people like Cohn-Bendit &amp; Schulz keep the stooge MEPs in line. The MEPs have to vote on an assembly-line of votes, sometimes more than 100 per day, needless to say they hardly have time to examine them properly, and so it is estimated that now 70%-80% of the UK&rsquo;s laws have been made in Brussels. As for Steyn&rsquo;s portrayal of the Nationalist parties being in disarray, he fails to mention that the threshold to form a EU Parliament grouping (therefore generous EU funding) was raised in 2008 the fight being led by the &#8221;Socialist&#8221; grouping, from 20 to 25 MEPs solely to criminally deny the Nationalist grouping EU funding. Despite having no extra EU funding fourteen Nationalist MEPs from the UK, France, Hungary, Austria and two other nations have formed an alliance, with other Nationalists having differences (some smaller nations want less EU integration but wish to remain in the EU), but the 25 member mark may yet be reached to form a grouping. </p>

		<p>Note that Mr. Steyn is only concerned with political correctness insofar as it shifts politics to the right. He has no sympathy for the growing demands of sovereignty by those victimized by government-enforced diversity. To him, a best case scenario would be if the peoples of Europe disappeared silently in an immigration induced genocide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only the noise of our holocaust he objects to.</p>

<p>North Americans, especially Canadians, prefer to bury their heads in the proverbial sand and pretend that the problems outlined by Steyn above do not exist.</p>

		<p>&#8220;A Federation of Euro-harmony filled by ultra-nationalist xenophobes is almost too droll a jest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is what I find tiresome: erudite self-styled intellectual mavricks proclaiming to look upon the reactions of everyday people with superior disdain. Robin Hanson at OvercomingBias has spoken at length about how many public statements have no other purpose than to signal the author&rsquo;s status or that of his class or tribe - and that is what we are seeing here. The unconscious Left speaking its dislike of reality. </p>
<p>This anti-occident project has progressed so far, so fast, that it forces its erstwhile advocates into an uncomfortable role. </p>
<p>They sense that if they pursue their logics any further, they are going to look like serious traitors to their own people; after all, each of the crises initiated by them are proceeding quickly to their respective boiling points. They want the moral authority of someone who stands for their own people - but this is denied them by the promises they&rsquo;ve made, the contacts they have, the sensibilities they&rsquo;ve cultivated, their vilification of everyone to the right of them, in short their whole political personae and momentum. </p>
<p>They sense their impending loss of legitimacy, and know there is nothing they can do about it. Mealy-mouthed non-zero-sum advocates don&rsquo;t have much place in a world that is brutally and obviously zero-sum, such as the one dawning now. </p>
<p>Affectation and histrionics is the last resort of those with nothing to say. And furiously signaling erudition, intellectual status, and abhorrence - thats all these people have Left(pun).</p>
<p> As more people realize that there are far scarier things in this world than being ridiculed by Mark Steyn and the class of day-dreamers who stand behind him, his moral abhorrence will have less and less power to control the minds of men. </p>
<p>&#8220;Too droll a jest&#8221; - that needs to be translated back into the soul of him that wrote it. Take two steps back from the comfortable, fake world of leftism and it appears that Mark Steyn is the one unwittingly making a joke. <br>

		<p>Steyn sounds like he&rsquo;s not exactly a happy camper. Apparently, he&rsquo;s begun to grasp the fact that multiculturalism, like AIDS, is a member of that peculiar class of gifts that keep on giving.</p>
<p>Steyn, if you read this, congrats to you for discovering the obvious, good job buddy. By all means, keep on thinking about the subject, but pace yourself, Steyn, pace yourself. We don&rsquo;t want you to get hurt while you&rsquo;re trying to grasp something we here at Amren figured out years and years ago. </p>
<p>On a purely personal note, I first understood this during the early 1970s. I think I would have gotten it sooner, during the 1960s, but I was too busy playing tag, hide and seek, doing homework, avoiding schoolyard bullies, and all the other stuff one typically does in grade school.</p>

<p>But, since they don&rsquo;t let regular White folks  (concerned about the future for White grandchildren) get published in their magazines or appear on Fox TV and they smear us endlessly as &#8220;Nazis&#8221;, &#8220;Fascists&#8221;, why should we publish them?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t hate them, we just don&rsquo;t really care to hear what they have to say as we know what they will always say&hellip;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Neo Conservatives against the whole crazed, Jihadist, Liberal/Marxist world and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t bow down to the Neo Cons is a Nazi/Fascists.</p>
<p>Mark Steyn should get a real blue collar job - we did fine without these folks and we will do better without them in the future.</p>

		<p>Steyn deserves to be criticized, but he is also the closest that many Canadians will come to a critic of hate speech laws, liberal values, multiculturalism, and Muslim immigration to Europe. He can serve as a stepping stone for Canadians who are reluctant or afraid to go all the way toward AmRen&rsquo;s position.</p>

		<p>Not exactly on topic but since when did Racialism or White Nationalism or whatever you want to call it equal &#8220;fascism&#8221;?  What does the fact that I want Western Culture and White people to exist in the near future and beyond have anything to do with supporting a fascist political paradigm?  <br>
Most WN&rsquo;s I know are from from being fascist and if anything tend to be more libertarian.  I&rsquo;m tired of the &#8220;fascist&#8221; label the hateful Left has thrust upon us&hellip;     </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to tell what the authors overall goal is. Maybe he&rsquo;s just reporting the facts as best he knows them. It definitely sounds right, though, when he says, &#8220;The problem in (america) is not a lunatic fringe but a lunatic mainstream ever more estranged from its voters.&#8221;<br>

		<p>From what I gather Steyn is a &#8220;culturalist&#8221; and not a racialist.  He talks about Muslim immigration and birthrates transforming the landscape of Europe, but it&rsquo;s always within the framework of one culture replacing another culture rather than one people replacing another people.      </p>
<p>As a man of European descent, the fact of White European people becoming a small percentage of the population of their former home is apparently not a problem I should concern myself with.  The problem according to Mr. Steyn, is that the people who are demographically replacing my people wear burqas.   </p>
<p>He opposes the elimination of European culture, but supports the elimination of European people.  Kind of a befuddled position if you ask me, but there it is.</p>

		<p>by now, most Europeans have had enough experience with Muslims, Caribbean blacks, Africans, etc. to know that they can never be really assimilated to Europe in large numbers, but can only destroy it. (selective immigration of small numbers is fine, practically no one is against it)</p>
<p>many dream of a brief interregum of far right power in Europe, just long enough to halt immigration and return many undesirables to their home countries.</p>
<p>at that point, the European majority would return to its traditional politics:</p>
<p>strong social democracies, but in ethnically defined communities.</p>
<p>social democracy in a country like Norway prior to mass immigration is basically a large extended family taking care of its own (Steve sailor has made this point often, and he is spot on).</p>
<p>women who can no longer walk down the streets of their hometowns safely are not voting for &#8220;fascism,&#8221; but for a return to our time when Europe was and gang rapes and acid attacks on women were virtually unknown.</p>
<p>traditional European social democracy is NOT!!!!!!!!! an American style welfare state for minorities.</p>
<p>that is because especially in northern Europe, there is a very strong sense of duty and individual responsibility.</p>

In my house, we don&rsquo;t use the F-word.* </p>
<p>We especially don&rsquo;t use that word when it doesn&rsquo;t apply   &mdash;   and I do NOT believe it applies to the British National Party. Some of these other European parties, well, I&rsquo;m not knowledgeable enough to say. Those Hungarians in their uniforms might qualify for the F-word, but the BNP do not. </p>
<p>Mark Steyn is an excellent commentator on Islamification, and is very smart on many things   &mdash;   so let&rsquo;s not all give up on him just yet. I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s behind Steyn&rsquo;s squeamishness about the so-called &#8220;far right&#8221; parties, but I&rsquo;m holding out hope that this negative attitude of his is only temporary. </p>
<p>I think Steyn will start to get over his apprehensions about these parties once he sees their newly-elected MEPs advocating in Brussels THE EXACT SAME MEASURES that Steyn himself recommends to reverse the Third Worlding of Europe: ending Muslim mass immigration; the deporting of foreign criminals; nationalism rather than internationalism; and the eventual marginalizing (or, better yet, dismantling) of the EU itself.  </p>

		<p>Mark Steyn is a really fine writer and his skilful and very dry irony / satire may have flown over a few respondents&rsquo; heads here. </p>

<p>I am delighted the BNP got 2 Euro-seats but sad they missed getting 5.</p>
<p>Griffin the one-eyed and undiscourageable is a suave and smart leader and now a new MEP. Splendid!</p>
<p>That said, Andrew Brons, now also an MEP, is an unreconstructed Old Nationalist Right nutter whose skull is still half-full of idiotic Jewish World Conspiracy theories - although the ever-growing BNP now has 1 Jewish elected member of a local council and several other Jewish members plus 1 half-Turkish elected councillor.</p>
<p>Turning the BNP into a REAL mainstream party with clean fingernails without throwing out the essential nationalism is going to be quite a trick. Cross fingers!</p>
<p>Please go to the BNP website and check it out for yourselves. Plenty there to inform and encourage!</p>
<p>As for ATAKA, the Bulgarian nationalist party, I have to say that many of their hopes and dreams are utopian.</p>
<p>Again, they have a website - part of which is in English; their program is clear and easily grasped [and no longer includes the amusing but grisly threat to boil the bloody awful larcenous and workshy Roma* down and make glue from them.]</p>
<p>* FOOTNOTE:  Every liberal-left commentator on Bulgaria readily gushes that the Roma are subjected to incessant &#8220;police harrassment&#8221; just as though the Bulgarian police considered this a more amusing activity than watching soccer on TV and stuffing their faces. The sad true fact is that in Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary your missing car, motorcycle, bicycle, fridge and TV is quite likely to have found its way to the &#8216;mahala&rsquo;, the Roma quarter. </p>

		<p>It ought to be noted that the *Movement for Rights and Freedoms* - which is the political party which represents the interests of the large [12% - 15%] Turkish-mother-tongue minority in Bulgaria is part of the current governing coalition.</p>
<p>It is alleged by many in ATAKA - and not only by people in the ranks of ATAKA - that the MRF receives direct and indirect subsidies from the Turkish government.</p>
<p>ATAKA sees the MRF as a Turkish &#8216;Trojan Horse&rsquo; with no real loyalty to Christian Bulgaria or its heroic history of struggle against living as serfs under the Ottoman Yoke; ATAKA hates the MRF with a passion.</p>

In thinking about the future of Europe I come to the conclusion that the power of rhetoric on either Right or Left will prove relatively ineffective to stop the growth of militant Islam. Ultimately that political religion wants to control the turf, to put it bluntly. It is like a gang in that sense. The goal differs from gangland&rsquo;s; but not by much. Nations in Europe will have to face humiliation as pieces of their territories revert to ideologically foreign control. The parties that advocate policing of these salients (Right wing) or negotiation with them (Left wing) will join across nations. It seems odd, but this threat will probably unite the peoples of Europe more effectively than any previous force has. I think American politicians will have no say in this fight, other than to splutter about neo-Fascism. It is not our fight; we operate according to &#8220;a different model&#8221; according to our suave Liberals. <br>
Where we will assert our &#8220;soft power&#8221; in the future is anyone&rsquo;s guess. </p>

<p>&#8220;Fascism&#8221; comes from the Latin &#8220;fasces&#8221; which was a physical symbol of power, wherein several wooden rods that were cut exactly or almost exactly alike were bundled up and tied together.  Similarly, the human body has a self-defense and self-repair mechanism called &#8220;fascia,&#8221; and in architecture, it refers to some ornament of a design repeated over and over.</p>
<p>The symbolism of it all is that in the political sense, &#8220;fascism&#8221; means anything that gives preference to a particular group of human beings having something in common, over and above the universal, the whole of humanity.  That actually defines most people and most politics.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, &#8220;communism&#8221; is the opposite, in that it gives preferences to the &#8220;common&#8221; or the universal of humanity, over the particular.  At least in theory.</p>

		<p>The real facists are on the left.  Facism is a joining of government and corporate power that treats the citizens as mere tools to achieve the ends of the elite.  That is exactly what the left wants.  If wanting national sovereignty, the preservation of your own culture and traditions, and control of your own country&rsquo;s borders is &#8220;facism&#8221; then every country that fought the Nazis was facist.<br>

		<p>I voted for the B.N.P. in the Euro elections because I believe in Nationalism and am deeply opposed to the Communist Nu Labour Party.For a political analyst,you use this term rather carelessly in my opinion.The B.N.P. are Patriots and want to save Britain from the destruction of the Left Wing.The British people have never been asked if they approved of immigration from the third world and believe me,they do not want it.It has been forced upon us and we have suffered terribly under Nu Labour who have bullied us with Political correctness and draconian laws if we dare speak against immigration.It doesn&rsquo;t get mentioned even now! when we are on the eve of Labour being thrown out; such is the stranglehold of Politically correct brainwashing and control.<br>
The B.N.P. are the only hope to save Britain from being irrevocably changed. <br>
In my opinion,Fascism is a term that belongs in the 1920s and 30s.If it can be defined then one of its main characteristics is the conquest of other Nations which is definitely not what the B.N.P. advocates.We just want OUR COUNTRY back which has been given away to Foreigners by COMMUNIST Nu Labour.The term Fascism is used aginst the B.N.P. because it has negative impilications and people here have been fooled by this for along time.However people over this side of the Atlantic have grown wise to the methods of the Left wing and we have had enough.I was really shocked and hurt to learn that the U.S.A. is now in danger from the same evil forces and hope that you wise up quicker than we have.<br>
Good luck to our American cousins.</p>

		<p>The German Philospoher Hegel was an Idealist.He believed in the Power of Thought,that Ideas were the basis of everything and that Ideas were the dynamic of human Social change.He believed that human thought in all of its manifestations was the basis of Culture and Economics and everything else came from the power of Human creation.Hegel believed in a powerful Cultural Spirit that somehow moved through the Ages and manifested itself in the most Advanced Societies of the age such as Ancient Greece and the Romans.In Hegels day it was Prussia.This cultural Spirit Hegel called &#8216;Geist&rsquo;Hitler was influenced by Hegel in that Hitler thought that anything could be achieved by human Ideas. <br>
Ironically,Karl Marx was a student of Hegel but Mark&rsquo;s philosophy is said to have turned Hegel&rsquo; on his head&rsquo; because Marx believed that the basis of the dynamic of human Society was Materialistic and Ideas were the result of Materialism.Whereas Hegel argued that economics was the result of Ideas. <br>
This is the fundamental difference between Left and Right. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Europe is a lunatic mainstream ever more estranged from its voters.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Which describes perfectly the elites throughout the West.</p>
<p>The corporate miscreants opted out of loyalty to their own people, along with the corrupt politicians, when they realized that globalism would increase their bottom lines substantially.</p>
<p>With all the zeal and gusto of the radical left, they continued to support Republicans, because, economically, they favored the wealthy, but these same elitists favored the leftists because their philosophy of open borders allowed them cheap labor and the ability to earn hundreds and even thousands of times more than what they were worth.</p>
<p>Anybody that thinks a CEO who EARNS multimillion dollar bonuses really deserves that kind of money doesn&rsquo;t understand that almost anyone with a solid business background could do the same job just as effectively.  It amounts to internal corruption where the controllers within a corporation make certain they and their co-conspirators are paid excessively even when there are no profits earned.</p>
<p>Claiming the necessity to pay exorbitant wages to higher echelon types is required in order to attract &#8220;talent&#8221; is so laughable it is the stuff of science fiction and Ponzi schemes.</p>
<p>Good bye and good riddance to the corporate traitor who sold his people and his country out for money.  </p>
<p>Oh, is he in line to get what is due him in the next 5 or 6 years.</p>
<p>There have been riots in Greece and other countries, and Iceland threw its government out.  Look for an increase in intensity by the people to square matters with those corporate crooks and corrupt politicians who have had their foot on their necks for years now. </p>
<p>The debt started coming due in 2008.   It will be paid in full from this point forward.</p>
