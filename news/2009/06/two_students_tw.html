<p>In the 20 or so miles that separate Jefferson High School from La Cañada High, in the miles between inner city and suburb, there exists a social chasm so deep as to seem unbridgeable. It is possible that, growing up in the same metropolitan area, you have never been in the same place at the same time. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>La Cañada High is about as good as public education gets in California. It is the reason why many people live in La Cañada Flintridge, where tasteful, multimillion-dollar homes sprawl at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains. College is a given for almost everyone. The dropout rate is close to zero. Students don&rsquo;t qualify for free lunches, but they can buy sushi. Built in the 1960s and oddly evocative of the television show &#8220;The Jetsons,&#8221; the campus recalls a time when California schools didn&rsquo;t so much anticipate the future as embody it.</p>
<p>Jefferson, in hard-core South L.A. gang territory, is an improving school that nevertheless exemplifies all the challenges of urban education. It has an inspiring history, but its recent past has been troubled. Today it is a landing pad for the children of immigrants. Nearly half the students learn English as a second language. Free lunch is available to anyone willing to stand in line. About 800 freshmen arrive each year, most ill-prepared for high school. Four years later, about 200 pick up diplomas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On a warm October morning, Henry [Ramirez, a student at Jefferson] begins school with Life Skills, a required class. When it ends, he waits by the door for his friend Jessica Martinez, who greets him with a hug and then lays her head on his shoulder. Two other girls come to join her, and Henry leaves to go to French 3.</p>
<p>Class is conducted in a mix of English and elementary French, with almost all of the French coming from the teacher, Richard Jessel. The students go over an assignment in which they wrote two- and three-word sentences, such as &#8220;She walks&#8221; and &#8220;You are working.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Where would they be in a standard French curriculum? &#8220;I&rsquo;d place them in the middle of my second semester of French 1,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s not a lot of willingness to study at home, not a lot of motivation.&#8221; The students are also shy, he said, fearful of sounding stupid. And there is almost no chance that any have traveled to French-speaking countries.</p>
<p>Henry spends lunch working with another student on a project for their English class. Afterward, he has Introduction to Sociology, a project-based class that seems impressively stimulating, and Geometry, which he is repeating. Since Jefferson is on a block schedule, his other classes are on alternate days: Honors U.S. History, Honors American Literature, Chemistry and Algebra 2. Henry takes no Advanced Placement classes, a disadvantage when he applies to college. But it&rsquo;s hardly a slacker&rsquo;s schedule.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s confront a hard truth. Any visitor to [the] two schools can&rsquo;t help but notice that the La Cañada students, while hardly perfect, seem more focused, more driven to succeed than the average student at Jefferson. {snip}</p>
<p>Flecha [Juan Flecha, the Jefferson principal] makes no excuses. Although he has presided over a sharp increase in test scores, he volunteered that only 27% of his students graduate in four years and only 16% take a college prep curriculum. &#8220;That&rsquo;s terrible,&#8221; he said. But he speaks compassionately about the challenges they face: failing elementary and middle schools. Collapsing families. Entrenched poverty. Epidemic violence. On the first day of class this year, at 10:30 a.m., a man with an AK-47 was spotted firing shots a half-block from campus.</p>
<p>At La Cañada, violence is scarcely a concern. Elementary schools and the one middle school are excellent. Students are highly motivated, highly competitive. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have dress code violators. I don&rsquo;t have fights,&#8221; said Principal Damon Dragos. &#8220;The kids all come very well prepared. The question is not whether they&rsquo;re going to college; it&rsquo;s whether it&rsquo;s the college of their choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Another October morning. Kyle [Gosselin, a student at La Cañada] starts his day in Advanced Placement English, where the topic is the Chaucer poem &#8220;Troilus and Criseyde.&#8221; Then, it&rsquo;s SSR  &mdash;  basically, homeroom, where students are given 15 minutes for &#8220;sustained silent reading.&#8221;</p>
<p>German 3 is next. It begins with the young teacher, Melanie Sos, saying: &#8220;So, guten morgan. Wie geht&rsquo;s?&#8221; (&#8220;Good morning. How&rsquo;s it going?&#8221;) Like Henry&rsquo;s French class, much of this class involves the teacher speaking the foreign language and the students responding, sometimes in German, sometimes in English. But the level is markedly higher. Kyle and a classmate pore over a story, taking turns reading the German and translating. Kyle reads with some ease. The day&rsquo;s homework is to write 15 sentences summarizing what they&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>By now, Sos said, maybe half the students have traveled to Germany.</p>
<p>The rest of Kyle&rsquo;s day consists of Pre-Calculus, Honors Physics, Advanced Placement U.S. History and baseball.</p>
<p>Like most kids his age in La Cañada, Kyle has given a lot of thought to college. Asked at the beginning of the year if he&rsquo;d thought about specific schools, he gave a detailed answer: &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been thinking, like, Claremont-McKenna, USC, UCLA,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dartmouth is a great school. Then I&rsquo;ve been looking at liberal arts schools: Amherst, Haverford, Georgetown, maybe Johns Hopkins.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Maybe I&rsquo;d apply to UCSD because they have a good pre-med program.&#8221;</p>
<p>By spring, he had taken an East Coast college tour with his parents, hitting eight schools in six days, and had met for 80 minutes with La Cañada&rsquo;s college counselor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He took the PSAT sophomore year, and the SAT and ACT this year. He didn&rsquo;t have to go far for his SAT prep classes, which were held in his living room by his mom, Janna, and a friend; they started a small SAT prep business after seeing what else was available.</p>
<p>Henry began his junior year without a clue where he might want to go to college. After talking to the school nurse, a UC Santa Barbara graduate, he decided it sounded like a good place, because he likes the beach.</p>
<p>On the day that Henry was scheduled to take the PSAT, Flecha led a visitor to the classroom where students were working on the test. Flecha didn&rsquo;t spot Henry. The teacher looked around. No Henry. Flecha returned to his office, crestfallen.</p>
<p>Reached at home, Henry explained that his family had out-of-town relatives. Flecha slumped into his chair. &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t that something?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;All in a day&rsquo;s work around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later in the fall, UCLA sent mentors to Jefferson to help students prepare their college application essays. Henry, whose grades have mostly been A&rsquo;s and Bs, with some lapses, called his &#8220;The Rollercoaster,&#8221; writing about family tensions and his frequent moves. &#8220;The major problem was, I could never get used to something. I would always think it would get snatched away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not long after, Henry&rsquo;s parents told him they were returning to Texas  &mdash;  in less than a week. On Jan. 27, the family piled into a car attached to a rental trailer. They made the 1,500-mile drive in two days. About half an hour outside Houston, Henry began to cry. &#8220;It really got to me,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><br>
Let&rsquo;s confront a harder truth: the successful school is entirely Whites and Yellows. The pathetic school is entirely Browns and Blacks. Whites and Yellows are more successful at school   &mdash;   and life   &mdash;   than Browns and Blacks because they are SMARTER. And IQ study after IQ study confirms this. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;[The Brown/Black school] is a landing pad for the children of immigrants&hellip;  About 800 freshmen arrive each year, most ill-prepared for high school. Four years later, about 200 pick up diplomas.&#8221;</p>

		<p>To think   &mdash;   the good libs who run the school in La Canada Flintridge will put in place a system where a Jefferson student gets into UCLA before one of their own, better qualified, white students.  </p>
<p>A diploma from each of these schools are not the same thing.  Jefferson only has a 25% graduation rate, but even that has come at the cost of dumbing down the curriculum.  </p>
<p>Unless &#8220;free lunch&#8221; or being on the &#8220;free or reduced lunch program&#8221; is a media circumlocution for race, then I object to it being used as a handicap.  I went to a HS that had a high percentage of free/reduced lunchers (me included), but that didn&rsquo;t preclude it from being the best in the state.</p>

		<p>The really sad part is that Henry Ramirez has a better chance of getting into Yale Or Hrvard on full scholarship than Kyle Gosselin would. </p>
<p>The really SADDEST part is that most of La Cañada High&rsquo;s student body are probably Obama supporters. </p>

		<p>How times have changed! I recall back in 1962 when my public high school in West Los Angeles (almost all white) played Jefferson High (almost all black) in basketball. </p>
<p>There was also an easiness of race relations for the most part. I remember selling American flags with a crew of guys my age in South Los Angeles and fear of crime just didn&rsquo;t enter our minds.</p>
<p>All that changed with the Watts Riots of 1965, with the line being taken from the Magnificent Montague, &#8220;Burn, baby, burn, don&rsquo;t throw any water just let it burn.&#8221; From that point on, combined with the Hippie movement and the Vietnam War, and increasing drug use among the middle class youth, the beginning of the end started.</p>
<p>Now Jefferson High has a different racial component, and I guess La Canada is in a different world. But all of us are living in the United States of America, and no matter how privileged the young people are who attend an upscale high school near the San Gabriel mountains, the future sociological makeup is going to be vastly different over the next several decades, with each decade registering less and less white population, and the youngest generations of whites already a minority group in a country of minorities. At that point, with a Third World population, is there any doubt that the United States will definitely have a Third World economy, no matter how many optimistic predictions from future politicians. </p>

How long will it be before the proposed solution will be to bus the &#8216;under-served&rsquo; to the better school?</p>
<p>How much longer after that when the bused in kids don&rsquo;t improve and parents demand the school be tailored to their needs?</p>

		<p>The youngsters here may not know this, but there was a time when almost any suburban middle class high school was like La Cañada, (but without the sushi) and you didn&rsquo;t need to buy a multi-million dollar house to live in the school district.  Diversity has made public schools a viable option only for the very rich.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure the state&rsquo;s has several solutions in mind  &mdash;  one will be to shovel even more worthless, unaccountable dollars into this hell-hole even though, according to the LA Unified web site, failing schools such as Jefferson receive funding above the state average:</p>
<p>District Expenditure / Student	$11,868    California Average / Student $9,980</p>
<p>According to NCLB:  &#8220;all students who are not officially &#8216;learning disabled&rsquo; be proficient in reading and math by the end of the 2013-14 school year&hellip; If a Title One school fails to make enough progress for two straight years, the school district must let its students go to other, better schools&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore, look for a new drive to re-start busing  &mdash;  bus students the 20 miles from Jefferson to LaCanada High School  &mdash;  or community activists will demand that residents of the dangerous area around Jefferson be &#8216;allowed&rsquo; to live in a nice, clean safe community such as LaCanada via Section 8 housing.  This will level the playing field as LaCanada&rsquo;s test scores plummet to those of Jefferson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The following corporations have made donations to Jefferson (from the school&rsquo;s own website):</p>
<p> Cisco, Community Options, Pacific Bell, Countrywide Home Loans, Detwiler <br>
 Disney, Mitsubishi, Sony Pictures, Universal Studios, Warner Bros.,Will &amp; Company</p>
<p>Yet with all that money and help, here are the latest &#8216;proficiency&rsquo; scores from Jefferson (the tests are ridiculously easy, I know this because I give them  &mdash;  and the term &#8216;proficient&rsquo; is used VERY loosely here, proficient should be defined in this case as extremely rudimentary).</p>
<p>[Jefferson&rsquo;s] Student Performance - California Standards Tests<br>
2007-08 Percent Proficient and Above<br>
English - Language Arts<br>
13.0%<br>
Mathematics<br>

<p>The type of student at this school, disinterested in education, unintelligent, impulse-driven, unmotivated, disconnected or hostile to education, will never be addressed or discussed.  It is NEVER the fault of the student and/or his family as to his failure to achieve.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve attended countless meetings and professional developments where the latest billion-dollar program was announced and unveiled, with much fanfare (and yawns from the realists).  One program after another, each more expensive, that will finally close the achievement gap!  &mdash;  all have gone down in flames, results the same:  failure, failure, failure because it is not possible to raise IQ levels or &#8216;make&rsquo; students learn anything.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government has been more than generous fire-hosing money into such a worthless cause, with dismal results. </p>
<p>Imagine if that money were fire-hosed into LaCanada High School and these bright students were offered college scholarships, partnerships with universities, enriched AP classes, field trips, summer internships in labs, visits to local universities,  mentors from professional fields  &mdash;  all of the things offered in the failing schools.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve learned not to expect any fairness toward White/Asian students.</p>

		<p>Clearly this is someone&rsquo;s fault. The only question is who should get the blame. Should it be the school where the students work hard and study. Or should it be the school where students don&rsquo;t work hard and study. Conservatives would blame the school where students don&rsquo;t study. whereas Liberals would blame the school where students do study. That&rsquo;s right folks. Stupid Liberals think that hardworking students are to blame for lazy students. Lest anyone call me biased I will readily admit it - because I attended a school where the students were lazy!!!</p>

		<p>Now that the word on La Canada is out, you can expect La Raza, NAACP, and God knows who else to start protesting and demanding bussing for Jefferson &#8220;students&#8221; to La Canada. Conversly, you can expect guilt-laden liberals affiliated with La Canada to reach out and embrace the multicultural students of Jefferson. This story will be the first nail in their coffin.</p>

		<p>Even if the US were still white, it would be financially unviable. Say you have three kids and your wife stays home to take care of them. If you make $50k/yr and education costs $12k/kid, your entire after-tax income will go to the NEA. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve attended countless meetings and professional developments where the latest billion-dollar program was announced and unveiled, with much fanfare (and yawns from the realists). One program after another, each more expensive, that will finally close the achievement gap! &mdash; all have gone down in flames, results the same: failure, failure, failure because it is not possible to raise IQ levels or &lsquo;make&rsquo; students learn anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously effort should still be made. Education/babysitting can still be useful, even for those who don&rsquo;t make it to the top. There will always be achievers and almosters, winners and losers, should we stop teaching for everyone? In fact, a more &#8216;libertarian&rsquo; perspective would not focus on the race of winners and losers at all. How many of X-race make it to the top, etc.</p>
<p>All educators need to keep trying, while they have at least one student left. If they could just accomplish this&hellip; keep up the efforts, without having to be so hateful towards the white race. You&rsquo;d think the fact that Asians are the privileged high scorers in California, and there are a lot of them, would be enough to change that all, but not so. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s of note that the faculty and staff of Jefferson high seem to suffer from that elitist delusion common to educrats everywhere that every single person must go to college, or be considered an abject failure. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. This society needs carpenters and pipe fitters a lot more than it needs people with inflated degrees in useless subjects like ethnic studies, liberal arts, and education. </p>
<p>Most Hispanics and even many blacks could be productive members of society if we would simply accept what they are and what they&rsquo;re capable of and put them on a vocational track. </p>
