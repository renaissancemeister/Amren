<h1>The Murder at Harvard</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John McWhorter, Minding the Campus, June 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A few weeks ago a teenaged pot dealer was shot dead in a Harvard dormitory.</p>
<p>That alone was depressing enough. However, Harvard suspects a black senior, Chanequa Campbell, of an association with the pot dealer  &mdash;  Justin Cosby, also black  &mdash;  and last week was barred from her dormitory and prevented from graduating. Campbell grew up in the depressed Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, but was a star student, a product of elite prep school Packer Collegiate Institiute, and four years ago was celebrated for her achievement.</p>
<p>The details have yet to be released. But one of the three men who planned the murder, and a suspect in the shooting itself, Jabrai Copney, is a songwriter from New York who was dating another Harvard undergrad named Brittany Smith who also grew up in Brooklyn. Copney and Smith are black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} the main question amidst all of this is a simple one: why was Chanequa Campbell, as a Harvard student who had triumphed over such odds, associating at all with a shady character like Jabrai Copney or anyone else who would? Or, of all of the men Harvard offered for her to date, including black ones, why was Brittany Smith &#8220;dating&#8221; Copney long-distance?</p>
<p>The good-thinking idea is, of course, that the problem is Harvard. The big bad bastion of White Power needs to look inward to figure out how neglect  &mdash;  surely racist on some level  &mdash;  left Campbell and Smith holding on to shady operators from back home for a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Typical is Jacqueline Rivers, co-director of a program that works with black high schoolers at Harvard, telling the Boston Globe that &#8220;there needs to be a lot of work thinking about how you help kids manage the transition in a setting where you&rsquo;re going to be rubbing shoulders with really wealthy people.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what does that mean? How would Harvard teach black students from poor neighborhoods how to &#8220;manage the transition&#8221; to an environment full of affluent white kids any more than they do now?</p>
<p>What, precisely, is there to teach? What wine goes with chicken? Dialect coaching? Unlikely, given that Campbell is clearly well-spoken. A six-week music appreciation program on white groups like Coldplay? What about that these days even affluent white students love the same hip hop Campbell does?</p>
<p>To what, then, is Jacqueline Rivers or anyone who says anything similar referring? Nothing real. It&rsquo;s a statement typical of the &#8220;dance&#8221; Shelby Steele eloquently writes about, in which it is eternally whites&rsquo; job to seek redemption for America&rsquo;s racist past while for blacks, as Steele put it in a recent Wall Street Journal piece, &#8220;the feeling of being aggrieved by American bigotry is far more a matter of identity than of actual aggrievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>What, for example, do we make of Campbell&rsquo;s claim that she has been targeted because &#8220;I&rsquo;m black and I&rsquo;m poor and I&rsquo;m from New York and I walk a certain way and I keep my clothes a certain way&#8221;? {snip}</p>
<p>The idea that Harvard was at fault becomes even harder to process when we consider the conflict between teaching students like Campbell to &#8220;manage the transition&#8221; and the noble idea that students like her contribute &#8220;diversity&#8221; to the campus. There would be a fine line between teaching students like Campbell how to &#8220;manage&#8221; the differences between them and Caitlin and Justin and teaching them how to be like Caitlin and Justin.</p>
<p>Last time I checked, the idea was that Caitlin and Justin were the ones who were supposed to do the &#8220;managing,&#8221; with taking in the &#8220;diversity&#8221; of students like Campbell as a key component of a liberal arts education.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students of all kinds should work together in managing the cultural differences between them&#8221; would be the administrator-speak answer  &mdash;  which looks great in print, but again, what, precisely would this mean in practice? What programs could be set in place to do better than the current situation at Harvard, where Campbell was apparently valued by non-black students for a warm, outgoing personality despite her &#8220;background&#8221; and, for the record, was not prosecuted for a case of check fraud during her first year (perhaps allowing for the &#8220;diversity&#8221; of her background)?</p>
<p>Chanequa Campbell and Brittinay Smith demonstrate not that Harvard has an under-the-board problem with racism, but that cultural legacies die hard for all of our good intentions. Campbell is clearly a star, as likely is Smith. However, they remain to some extent culturally rooted in the neighborhoods they grew up in, where activity on the wrong side of the law is, sadly, a familiar sight to all.</p>
<p>{snip} Yet, the fact is that Campbell and Smith lacked the basic sense of recoil from people of shady inclinations that most Harvard students have. The typical Harvard undergrad knows no one who gives the slightest indication of being capable of casual murder, or even of owning a weapon. A person in Bedford-Stuyvesant is much more likely to know such people. For Campbell and Smith, four years in Cambridge did not change that.</p>
<p>The case is reminiscent of the one in New York in 1985 where Edmund Perry, black, 17, fresh from Exeter and on his way to Stanford, was shot dead by an off-duty policeman he tried to rob with his brother, a sophomore engineer at Cornell who fled. Robbing a passerby on impulse was not as foreign a concept to these Harlem brothers despite their promising futures. &#8220;We got a D.T.!&#8221; Edmund&rsquo;s brother Jonah yelled as he ran away, as familiar with the local slang for &#8220;detective&#8221; as someone who had stayed behind on the corners.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The simple truth is that any meaningful &#8220;transition management&#8221; will entail teaching Harvard&rsquo;s students of poor background out of a sense of identity that includes hanging out with questionable characters from home. Harvard&rsquo;s black studies department is named after W.E.B. DuBois, celebrated for his plangent exploration of black people&rsquo;s &#8220;double consciousness&#8221; between American and Negro, &#8220;two warring ideals in one dark body.&#8221; Okay, but Du Bois wouldn&rsquo;t think twice about associating with riffraff.<br/>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the environment over heredity argument.  They way they figure, if you move ghetto dwellers to Harvard, Brahmin culture will rub off on them.  The truth of the matter is that you can take the dweller out of the ghetto, but you can&rsquo;t take the ghetto out of the dweller.</p>

<p>Are we supposed to call those poorer than us &#8216;riffraff&rsquo;? Or only those less intelligent than us? In today&rsquo;s world, those poorest are placed up on the highest pedestal. Considered to be more intelligent, street smart. More real or true. Every movie says this is so&hellip; In truth, after a Harvard education, they probably are more intelligent. </p>

		<p>Both Michelle Obama and Sonia Sotomayor are products of the Ivy League. Obama, Princeton and Harvard Law, Sotomayor, Princeton and Yale Law. One can only imagine how much affirmative action played in getting them into these school&rsquo;s. But both still seem to have a chip on their shoulder and bitterness in their heart. You only need listen to their storie&rsquo;s about their time spent at these school&rsquo;s. It is a constant litany of feeling different, left out, and being in a totally different world. Of course this is all the fault of the society that probably had to make all kinds of exception&rsquo;s to get them admitted. What ingrate&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Many of us in NYC remember the case of Edmund Perry. He was an honors student bound for Stanford U who was shot by a white cop he tried to rob.</p>
<p>At first Al Sharpton, the Village Voice, the NY Times etc tried to railroad the cop but eyewitnesses backed up his story.</p>
<p>After that the liberals went overboard w/their hand-wringing, repeatedly wondering how such a fine young man could turn to crime. <br/>

		<p>So it&rsquo;s Harvard&rsquo;s fault that a black, affirmative action beneficiary from the ghetto acts like a black from the ghetto?  Plenty of white kids feel alienated from campus life and continue to associate with friends from back home.  The difference is that their friends from back home usually aren&rsquo;t felons and drug dealers.  The real tragedy here is that there are thousands of deserving white kids from around the country who would have cherished to opportunity to go to Harvard (on a full scholarship I&rsquo;m sure) ans would have made the most of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised to see an article that somewhat honestly confronts the race issue in what I would suspect is a liberal college newspaper.  Still, I continue to be amazed at how upper-middle class, Northern whites seem so oblivious to the realities of black culture.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure this story is no surprise to anyone here at Amren. As for me, I&rsquo;ve often witnessed the ghetto thugs that come over to visit their upper middle class &#8216;brothas&rsquo; in &#8220;Whitey&rsquo;whirl&rsquo;&#8221;. They often sit in the driveway [barbecues just a smokin] starring menacingly at any Whites that happen to be around while drinking their 40oz.. Like they say, you can take them &#8216;out&rsquo; the ghetto, but you can&rsquo;t take the ghetto &#8216;out&rsquo; them.</p>

		<p>For blacks there is a lot of shame in succeeding in school and playing the white man&rsquo;s game, so they compensate by thugging it up. The other side of this is that blacks understand that weak people lose in the game of life. </p>
<p>Meanwhile too many whites pride themselves on being weak. Too many whites a proud of keeping themselves as distanced and unsullied (in their eyes) by any contacts with the unwashed physical classes as they can. </p>

		<p>I suspect Chanequa&rsquo;s application was thrown in the &#8216;Yes&rsquo; pile as soon as the admission&rsquo;s committee read her name. What this case represents, again, is that seemingly &#8216;good, decent&rsquo; blacks are quite often trojan horses for the types of blacks familiar to Amren readers. This applies not only to apartment buildings, neighborhoods, workplaces, etc. but also seemingly to institutions like Harvard.</p>
<p>This is also similar to the case at Eastern Michigan where Anne Dickerson was raped and murdered after somebody gave Orange Taylor unauthorized access to a dorm building. He was also involved in drugs with a circle of student users.</p>
<p>Just think, however, what the reaction would have been if a student reported these shady blacks in the dorm. The murder may have been prevented but the student making the report would have been run out on a rail as a &#8216;racist.&rsquo; </p>

		<p><i>The good-thinking idea is, of course, that the problem is Harvard. The big bad bastion of White Power&hellip;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be glad to explain the situation. My quote is: &#8220;The problem is Harvard. The big bad bastion of <b>Liberal</b> Power&#8221;. Before the 1940&rsquo;s, before Liberals took over the U.S., Blacks were productive and law abiding citizens. Their crime rate was slightly higher than average; their out of wedlock births (~20%) were very high by American, but not European standards. Thanks to the Liberals, this is no longer the situation: Crime is cool, and so are good time babies. </p>
<p>Final thought: I believe that Chanequa Campbell and friends have as much contempt for the Harvard Liberals as I have.</p>

		<p>I started out being impressed with Judge Sonie the Phony&rsquo;s life story, but I&rsquo;m backtracking on that in sorts.  I mean, yeah, it would have been easy for her to fall into the typical malaise lifestyle of the typical South Bronx Hispanic woman, but it&rsquo;s just as true that her climb from poverty to SCOUTS was more of an affirmative action escalator.  Let me put it to you another way   &mdash;   ceteris paribus, if Sonia Sotomayor was born white, male and in West Virginia, ambulance chaser at best. </p>

		<p>She was dating this street thug partly because educated black men usually want white women, and because most white men find black women physically revolting.</p>
<p>When you see a black man with a women not of his race, what is she?  White or Mestizo.</p>
<p>When you see a white man with a woman not of his race, what is she?  Almost always Asian.</p>
<p>She was also dating him because she felt comfortable with him for a while.  Why would that be?  </p>
<p>No hand-wringing here.  Not my problem, except the lingering question as to why Harvard thinks it can mass-produce silk purses from sows&rsquo; ears.</p>

		<p>I guarantee you these allegedly good students don&rsquo;t have the IQ and basic academic skills to attend Harvard. They are doing well just like President 57 states of the USA, Austrian speaking, Obama is a constitutional scholar. He obviously met only one important criterion for attending Harvard Law and being named to the Law review: His skin color. Obama doesn&rsquo;t possess even basic knowledge any community college graduate possesses. I&rsquo;m sure these allegedly great students, are just the smartest of their Brooklyn slum neighborhood which doesn&rsquo;t come close to meeting minimum standards to attend Harvard. This perfectly explains their clear lack of judgment which is due to their unexceptional IQs.</p>

		<p>One spoken intention of AA is that if blacks are exposed to a certain environment they will succeed, that is they only need a chance.</p>
<p>The reality, from what I&rsquo;ve seen is that AA causes a dumbing down of whites and not an uplifting of blacks. In my civil service job AA rules the day. The result is a totally unprofessional, zany atmosphere where irrationality rules. Hard work is to be scorned and complaining about any and everything is the norm.</p>

		<p>It hs been my experience that the blacks who come here from africa as &#8220;exchange students&#8221; want NOTHING to do with &#8220;American blacks&#8221;  Of course, American blacks blame their &#8220;ghetto culture&#8221; on &#8220;slavery&#8221; and the &#8220;white man keeping them down&#8221;.  The foreign blacks don&rsquo;t want to hear it.  Where the American blacks see &#8220;oppression&#8221;, the african blacks see &#8220;opportunity&#8221;.  There has NEVER been a culture that did not assimilate (and make something of themselves) in one generation.  Blacks have been here how long?<br/>
American blacks were actually doing quite well BEFORE the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; push and lbj&rsquo;s &#8220;war on poverty&#8221; in the 1960s.</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;ll get &#8216;em into Harvard!   And maybe into the White House!</p>

<p>The theory I have heard why blacks give each other unique first names has to do with slavery.  Because families were often broken apart, slave parents gave their destined to be slave children a unique first name, so that when they were inevitably sold down the river, literally, the parents could keep up with how their child was doing through the gossip lines, because they know the name they hear can only be their child.</p>
<p>The flaw in this theory is that these creative first names are only a ca. last 30 years thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m with you.  Word will get on the street, especially in states that have banned affirmative action, that the way to get your kid into State U. is to give them an obviously black first name.</p>

<p>Maybe we should start naming our kids in a blatantly &#8220;ghetto&#8221; fashion. For instance, &#8220;D&rsquo;Antwan Allen Smith&#8221; could go by &#8220;D. Allen Smith,&#8221; and <i>already</i> sound like he should be in law school. </p>

&#8220;I&rsquo;m surprised to see an article that somewhat honestly confronts the race issue in what I would suspect is a liberal college newspaper. <br/>
Still, I continue to be amazed at how upper-middle class, Northern whites seem so oblivious to the realities of black culture.&#8221;<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>What is this &#8220;middle-class&#8221; nonsense?</p>
<p>Why shy away from saying it?  These are much more than &#8220;upper-middle class&#8221;!</p>
<p>Billionaires and royalty from around the world flock to Harvard.   These are  VERY upper-upper-class.</p>
<p>As someone above said, they are given a little bit of &#8220;spice&#8221; or seasoning from the ghettos.  Part of their liberal education.</p>

		<p>Again, the  above  posters  are  not thinking rationally.  Ms. Campbell is  obviously a  glaring exception to the statistical data  trend of African  American  students  who attend and  graduate from Harvard. The vast  majority  graduate then go on to obtain some  post-graduate degree. </p>
<p>This  is  just  an exceptional  case  out of  thousands of blacks  who  have  attended  Harvard and other like schools  over  the  last 20 years.  Just  as  you  have  your  ocassional  white  student  admitted  to  a  prestigious  medical school who  ends up accused  of  murder.  Or a  successful white  actor dying as a result of  an  absurd autoerotic experiment.</p>
<p>To generalise from  an exceptional case  shows  poor thinlking skills.</p>

		<p>29 ghw: Several years ago there was a movie starring Jim Carrey called &#8220;The Truman Show.&#8221;  Jim Carrey played a character who lived in a town built just for him.  Every single person in the town, including his wife, was there only to be a backdrop for Carrey&rsquo;s character.  That&rsquo;s what Harvard is about.  The elite go there, and a bunch of other bright kids are admitted to be the mix.  Occasionally, one of the bright kids is adopted into the ruling class, but, unless they&rsquo;re in one of the science departments, the non-elite don&rsquo;t get much of an education.  The whole point is to give the young aristocracy a pleasant experience and a prestigious degree.   The bright non-elite kids don&rsquo;t get much of an education, but they are certified by Harvard as smart, so admission to just about any grad school is automatic.  That&rsquo;s their reward for being bit actors in the elites&rsquo; theater.  </p>

		<p>Would that &#8220;successful white actor&#8221; be David Carridine, Occam?</p>
<p>Yes, autoerotic asphyxiation was my first guess, too.  Unfortunately, Mr. Carridine&rsquo;s family wants the FBI involved (though what jurisdiction they have in Thailand is unclear.)  This will only serve to keep the poor man&rsquo;s name and the manner of his demise in the news longer than otherwise would be the case.</p>
<p>The &#8220;above posters&#8221;, however are thinking quite rationally.  If you genuinely dispute that, please start by telling us exactly what was incorrect about my own post.</p>
