<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Breaking down large contracts so smaller, minority-owned companies can successfully bid for them, and creating a micro-loan fund are among recommendations made in a study of Davenport&rsquo;s bidding process.</p>
<p>Davenport is the first Iowa city to review its purchasing practices related to minorities. The total cost of the study was just under $150,000, with the state of Iowa picking up $75,000 of the total.</p>
<p>Davenport&rsquo;s Affirmative Action Advisory Committee will present the study, by Oakland, Calif.-based Mason Tillman Associates, to the Davenport City Council at its July 15 meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study, more than 200 pages long, makes 35 recommendations on how to open up bidding to more minority-owned businesses. Staff is considering which five of the 35 recommendations to implement as soon as possible, Redmond Jones, Davenport affirmative action officer, said as the advisory committee reviewed the report Thursday.</p>
<p>Sub-contractor recommendations led the list of possible changes that could be made to help minority-owned businesses, according to the study. Among them were breaking large procurements into smaller contracts where feasible, establish a direct purchase program for supplies or equipment, so that a subcontractor only needs to provide labor, establish an apprentice program on construction contracts and establish an owner-controlled insurance program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They want you to compete with a large contractor, but with the cost of financing and insurance, that is a big problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need help.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study notes a number of anecdotal problems that minority-owned companies face with city contracts, including being held to a higher standard than their non-minority counterparts, difficulty breaking into the contractor community, problems meeting the city&rsquo;s contractor licensing test.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Our biggest job is to educate minority contractors and advocate for minority contractors,&#8221; he [Sydney Ethridge, of the Minority Enterprise Construction Council] said. &#8220;We need to move forward aggressively.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the MECC will teach how to bid for contracts, provide information needed in the bidding process and make sure they have all the documentation needed for a successful bid.<br>

		<p>The race-replacement enthusiast have taken their vicious race war against Native  Born White Americans into the American Heartland. It is not posible anymore to run away from the enemy. The Enemy should have been stopped at the border.</p>
<p>Hindu females from India now qualify for diversity set aside programs for American woman. The racial transformation is proceeding very rapidly. The census Bureau will be making a big annoucement in 2010. And when this announcement is made race-replacement enthusiasts and post-1965 asians,hispanics,blacks,africans and muslims will be in the face of Native Born White Males announcing their inevitable demise. </p>
<p>In 2010 Native  Born White Americans are going to have make a decision:1)a complete revot aganat their racial dispossession at the hands of post 1965 non-whites or 2)race replacement and economic redundancy. Events will move swiftly. The White revolt must happen soon.</p>

		<p>I love this nonsense. For years all levels of govt. have been trying this razzmatazz idiocy to give contracts to minority outfits. All the established companies do is either hire a minority &#8220;contractor&#8221; to get a job (for a fee)and then go ahead and do it themselves, or set up a dummy minority owned corp. of their own and get the contract.</p>
<p>Every so often an actual minority owned outfit gets a job and for the most part louses it up so they&rsquo;re kicked off the job.</p>
<p>Such is the way of things.</p>

		<p>Comrade Ethridge has made his anti-capitalist philosophy clear.<br>
&#8220;Our biggest job is to educate minority contractors and advocate for minority contractors. We need to move forward aggressively.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I might add, &#8220;before people find out what our(anti-white) agenda REALLY is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Where are they going to get the money to pay them?</p>
<p>I mean, every governmental jurisdiction in the country is in big trouble financially, with revenues down across the board.</p>
<p>Too, we&rsquo;re just getting into this depression.  It will only get worse from here on out.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the WSJ thinks of it:</p>
<p><a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB124398568837379031.html" rel="nofollow">https://online.wsj.com/article/SB124398568837379031.html</a></p>
<p>Plus, take a look at California:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moneyandmarkets.com/california-collapsing-34271" rel="nofollow">https://www.moneyandmarkets.com/california-collapsing-34271</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably hard for some on here to believe, but I don&rsquo;t really like reporting as the prophet of doom, but let me just say that all the evidence points toward the biggest depression so far.<br>

		<p>Ask the people in Iowa, if they have any white relatives who live in areas where they are numerically a minority?</p>
<p>Say someone lives in Harlem, but is white. Would that white person get a MINORITY CONTRACT from Harlem&rsquo;s government?</p>
<p>IF the answer is Yes, then by all means support the minority contracting program in Iowa.</p>
<p>If the answer is No, then by all means OPPOSE the minority contracting program in Iowa.</p>
<p>What really matters is that taxpayer funds should not be wasted on inferior products.<br>
Go with the best company regardless of race.<br>
However, if that opportunity is lost, ask for the same type of benefits for whites who are a minority in other areas.<br>

<p>Events will move swiftly. As the reality of extinction looms more and more inevitable, white women will also become &#8216;white nationalists&rsquo;. &#8216;Swiftly&rsquo; is a relative term, however, as events take time for &#8216;reality&rsquo; to catch up with it. Life expectancy at birth is around 80 years nowadays.<br>

		<p>Funny how every new immigrant group to arrive in the US was a &#8220;minority,&#8221; and most of them still are.  Yet somehow these minorities were assimilated into the workforce, the culture, the larger economy, and became Americans in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s &#8220;minorities,&#8221; meaning mainly black Africans, whose roots often back over two centuries in this nation, cannot be assimilated, despite ongoing, almost desperate, efforts to kick-start them.  </p>
<p>How long will we continue to embrace (or pretend to embrace) the sociological fantasy that their failure, criminality, and chronic inability to cope with the requirements and demands of a modern civilization is solely the result of &#8220;discrimination?&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem, known to all, including blacks themselves, but proscribed from public discourse, is simply a large deficit in measurable intelligence among black Africans.</p>
<p>No problem has ever been solved without forthright identification. And if the white race shrinks from making that identification, I think we assume that our successors in the dominant pecking order of the races will not shrink from making the proper conclusions and taking the appropriate action.</p>

<p>We are seeing evidence of this (White women) here in the postings of AR and I am very glad to see it. Wish those of my own family would be so.</p>
