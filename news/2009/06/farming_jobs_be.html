			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anastasiya Bolton, KUSA-TV (Denver), June 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Farmers can use what&rsquo;s called the H-2A program to recruit foreign workers to do temporary or seasonal work here in the U.S.</p>
<p>From July to September of 2008, there were 171 H2-A jobs posted. Thirty-nine Americans applied for those positions.</p>
<p>The very next quarter, in the final three months of 2008, 887 Americans applied for the 981 H-2A available. And as unemployment jumped at the beginning of 2009, so did applications from Americans; 1,799 applied for 726 jobs. That means instead of the jobs being filled by foreign or migrant workers, they are mostly going to U.S. residents.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the American workers are now applying for farm jobs that maybe they may not have applied for in the past,&#8221; said Olga Ruiz, state monitor advocate with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment. &#8220;People who started out in agriculture or even field labor who got out of that field maybe went into construction or other types of work, who maybe got laid off for whatever reason, decided they wanted to go back to farm work, because it&rsquo;s a paycheck and they need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Condon posted two farm hand positions on Craigslist in April. He said he had to turn people away. Thirty-eight people applied.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had people with doctorates, we had people with masters degrees we had people with all sorts of different career backgrounds,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Carpenters, people who&rsquo;ve worked on farms in other countries, people who have managed museums, all sorts of things you would never suspect you would find on a farm labor application.&#8221;</p>

		<p>100% of agricultural jobs could be filled by native born Americans if wages were increased.  Labor is only a tiny percentage of the total cost of food and prices would not rise significantly if this were done.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s about time that jobs are going to American&rsquo;s first and foremost. I could understand if there was a legitimate need for foreign workers in some fields on a temporary basis only. However, when this is truly the case and there have been a few since the birth of this country than by all means use only temporary foreign workers, until the Americans are trained in that field. The foreign workers can only come, their family stays HOME in their country! </p>

		<p>Well, when you have people with doctorates and masters degrees applying for field labor jobs and getting turned away, there is something hideously wrong in Denmark. These fools, our so-called leaders, have sold us out for a bag of magic beans that they call &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; and we citizens get all of its &ldquo;rewards.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We have truly entered this country&rsquo;s Weimar period and things are not going to get better, for at least the next four or five years. What comes after that, I will not even begin to speculate about. But I will say this, I think we all have a pretty good idea that it will not be skipping around a maypole!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Farming jobs being picked clean by U.S. Residents&#8221;</p>
<p>My uncle bought a farm in Lancaster, California in the early sixties. He had made a small fortune in his machine shop, sub-contracting in aerospace products. But he became tired of the city and the daily grind. After putting in a water well, that cost sixteen thousand dollars in 1962 currency, he decided to grow alfalfa. He used modern tools and hired some of the local residents to occasionally help out. His son also helped, before he went off to the University. This was before the time of massive illegal immigration to California. All of the Americans he hired worked hard, as did my uncle. No one ever complained about the difficulty of the work or doing any kind of &#8220;stoop&#8221; labor that some elites later called, &#8220;jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do.&#8221; </p>
<p>Aside from all of this, most Americans before WW2, lived on farms and did all of the work, that, again according to the elites in this nation, &#8220;americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221;. Oh, how the American citizenry has been manipulated and abused for at least the last twenty years. Sometimes it is downright surreal what the public will acccept from its representatives. Now we have reached a stage where our industries have been sold off, jobs are simply outsourced and others insourced, and the American middle class has been abandoned by the business and political elite. Where we go from here, is anyones guess.</p>

		<p>I remember in university I asked a blonde, White female student from Arizona what she thought of the illegal alien problem in the South-Western US. Perhaps not surprisingly, she actually began to defend the Hispanic invasion with fanatic zealousness. And - lo and behold - one of her arguments for the hispanic invasion was that Americans did not want to do menial tasks or manual labour such as farmwork. She then proceeded to pout like a spoilt child for the rest of the seminar. She was oblivious of the fact that SHE would be the type of person to suffer the most from this hostile racial invasion.</p>
<p>Funny that people with doctorates are applying to harvest crops&hellip; I guess her tired and insulting argument that &#8220;Americans just don&rsquo;t want such and such jobs&#8221; is just a bad joke. People in university are very naïve about the true nature of the world. Sad.</p>

		<p>In the 1980s when I was a teen, I de-tassled corn in the summers. It was full-time work that paid minimum wage, which was something like $3/hour. Being one of the few females that was employed, I struggled to do just as well as the guys. I was exhausted at the end of the day and some nights I remember just lying on the floor trying to ease the ache in my back. </p>
<p>But it was rewarding work - impressing my dad that I could do it and didn&rsquo;t quit the first day. Plus, the weekly paychecks wowed my friends who were making a little bit of money babysitting. </p>
<p>I take supreme offense when people say that Americans (code for &#8220;white people&#8221;) won&rsquo;t do this type of work. If I lost my job and had to find work, I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to do this type of work again.</p>

<p>Literally, apparently. Is this what we will be reduced to? Our creativity, our ability to remake the world and to reach the stars stolen from us? Who will innovate? Who will advance our civilization? Will it be Juan, down in the <i>barrio</i>, when he&rsquo;s not cutting the head off of a rival drug dealer?

The global warming bill cannot but add to the unemployment problem. The level of consumption will drop and depression will arrive full force.<br>

		<p>Interesting comments. The thing that many of us don&rsquo;t think about or understand is that we as Americans are the best workers the world has ever known. It&rsquo;s part of the definition of American. Remember, our forebares tore this country out of a wilderness not too long ago. That idea is deep inside us. Of course, many people don&rsquo;t want to do the work anymore, but when it comes right down to it, if an American has to do such hard work, he&rsquo;ll work anyone else under the table, and I&rsquo;m talking about the most effeminate hairdresser you can find. If he&rsquo;s an American, he too has that spark as well. Somehow, it&rsquo;s in us all.</p>

		<p>Post #1, Question Diversity, I would not only pick lettuce for $50.00 an hour, but I would wash it, and bag it for you,too. </p>
<p>Are you certain about the amount of $50.00? Or was this a typo, and really $5.00 an hour? </p>

		<p>I started my own Business when I was 12 years old, cutting lawns around my Neighborhood. I cut our lawn, so a Neighbor asked if I could help him out and do his, when he was away. I agreed. More Neighbors saw the work I did, and before you knew it, I was pushing my lawn mower all over Town. </p>
<p>I earned more money than my friends that had Paper Routes, and I was in charge. I not only cut grass, but I edged, trimmed, and shapped bushes, prunned trees, and occasionally dug out an old tree stump and its roots, all in 90 degree or better, Summer heat. </p>
<p>Through it all, I always tried to do a thorough job. And that&rsquo;s what kept people coming to me, to take care of their lawns, and gardens, when they were away on vacation. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand hearing some little runt like Robby Reich tell Congress, or the News Media that we need Illegal Aliens because Americans don&rsquo;t want to do this work. Americans have always done this work, from Jamestown, and the Massachusets Bay Colony, to the Pioneers and Homesteaders of the American West.</p>
<p>Just because Rob Reich doesn&rsquo;t want to get his delicate hands dirty, doesn&rsquo;t mean that the rest of us are incapable of pulling our own weight, and doing the labor that is required. </p>
<p>When I think about it, Robert Reich, the Clintons, and Kennedys, among all the other Liberal Idiots, should be made to do some really hard labor, just to get the taste of top soil in their mouths. Personally, I don&rsquo;t think any of them would last a day. All the more reason to push them harder in the fields. </p>
<p>But, when looking at the situation where those with Master&rsquo;s Degrees, and Doctorates are applying for Farm work, you know the economy is in the tank. </p>
<p>Apparently, Americans are doing jobs that Americans used to do, while Illegal Aliens, and Affirmative Action Blacks do sub-Standard Construction work on Homes, Schools, and Buildings, becuse it is required by law to have so many sub-Standard Workers on the Job Site. All work that White Americans used to do, and do well.</p>
<p>American Computer Science Graduates, and Engineers are displaced, as Indians, and other Asians come to take the higher paying jobs that Americans used to do, too. Of course, most of these Foreigners will end up sending the bulk of their money back to their home Country, or relocating their families here, who in turn will take away more jobs from Qualified White Americans. </p>

		<p>Farm work is slave work. As race-replacement accelerates, Native Born White Americans are going to lose more and more power and with this&hellip; control of their destiny. As non-whites replace Native Born White Americans in the military,police departments,attorney general offices,district attorneys offices and as  judges&hellip; at some point in time&hellip;. you will start to see Native Both White Americans fall into chattel slavery. And as the population of Native Born White Americans continues to rapidly fall, there will be no one to rescue them from chattel slavery. What, do you expect the blacks,hindus,sihks and chinese to lay their bodies on the line for Native Born White Americans?</p>
<p>I believe that if the will was there, Native Born White Amerians could completetly shut down post-1965 immigration policy and remove most of the post-1965 non-whites within a few years. The only reason these two things have not happened yet is because the will isn&rsquo;t there on a large enough scale. If the will doesn&rsquo;t emerge soon, chattel slavery could be in the future for Native Born White Americans.</p>

<p>It was $50.  Corroborated in three different MSM sources.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to be rich, it&rsquo;s another thing to be born with a silver spoon in one&rsquo;s mouth.  John McCain wouldn&rsquo;t understand the plight of the average white (or other) American if it hit him on the head.</p>
<p>Then again, this is a political disease:  When RFK was campaigning for President in 1968, and he was mouthing off about &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; he made some sort of flippant comment that started with, &#8220;When the average white American goes home to their house with two stories, a two-car garage, four bedrooms and a swimming pool in the backyard&hellip;&#8221;  Rich boy actually thought that the average white American in 1968 lived in such a house.  Then again, rich boy from Hyannis Port wouldn&rsquo;t have kenneled his dogs in a 2-story 2-car garage 4BR house with a swimming pool, too proletarian.</p>
<p>If I had to make one change in the Constitution when it comes to eligibility for public office, it would be that you can&rsquo;t be an elected politician unless you were born poor.</p>

		<p>Trouble with this country and it&rsquo;s culture of everyone must go to college is that we end up short on blue collar workers because it&rsquo;s been stigmatized.</p>
<p>It should be a rule that anyone graduating high school will not be allowed into higher education until they have completed at least one year of minimum wage work. No exceptions will be made and you can&rsquo;t buy your way out of it.</p>
<p>Not only will this fill any labor shortages but it will ensure every person with a degree will have at least some real world experience, even the politicians.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Jobs that Americans Won&rsquo;t Do&#8221;</p>
<p>The most simple of truth&rsquo;s that ends all debate on this discussion is this; We live in a finite space with rapidly dwindling resources. How these simpletons elected to govern us think ANY immigration policy above net 0% can&rsquo;t end in disaster is beyond comprehension. America cannot be the dumping ground of the world&rsquo;s breading classes.</p>

<p>A few decades ago, there was a major bigwig in the MO Democrat Party named Lester E. Cox. You&rsquo;ve probably never heard the name, but it&rsquo;s a famous one in Springfield because of Cox Medical Center, the second biggest hospital in MO after Barnes-Jewish.<br>
Much to the frustration and surprise of his fellow Democrats, Cox publicly claimed that he would not support JFK in 1960. His simple but insightful reason was that JFK never had a real job in his life.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity is right, McCain did indeed say that Americans wouldn&rsquo;t pick lettuce if it paid $50 an hour.  Hell, my own Mom would piok it if it paid that much.  When the Republicans chose John McCain over Ron Paul I knew that the Republican Party had chosen to commit sucicide.</p>
<p>As for the claims that farm work is &#8220;slave labor&#8221;, I have to disagree.  It is often hard and tedious work, but if you are free to seek alternative employment it isn&rsquo;t slavery.  It would pay better if we didn&rsquo;t have a vast pool of illegal immigrants in this country.  You&rsquo;d have to pay a little more for fruits and vegetables, which I would happily do if I knew it was because American citizens were being decently paid for their work.  It is the Democrats, and Republican traitors like McCain, who most oppose the policy of reducng immigration so that the demand for labor will then transfer more income from the upper and middle class to the working class.<br>

		<p>First, lets get rid of a lot of the &#8220;guidance counselors&#8221; at the high school level. For whatever reason, they seem to think that if you are on the college prep track and would like to learn a vocation, that you are &#8220;throwing your life away&#8221;. The scene in the movie &#8220;Clerks&#8221; that makes fun of the guidance counselor is probably one of the best depictions I have ever seen. These are the same people who will one minute, browbeat a kid into not going the vocational route, then call or text their friend and complain that they cannot find a worthwhile auto mechanic. As I like to say, when was the last time that you saw a guy standing on the street corner holding a sign that says &#8220;Broke/Homeless (Plumber / Electrician). God help me!&#8221; Unfortunately, the typical 16 y.o. doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to fight back again these people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in agreement with Anonymous #18 about a year of paid work before higher education. I would include a provision that to teach on the University level, you need five years of SUCCESSFUL REAL WORLD work experience in the private sector. It can be argued that the best crop of students to enter higher education were the returning veterans from World War II. </p>
<p>Granted, I am lucky to be able to support a family on a one-income blue collar job that is almost impossible to outsource. We live in a safe neighborhood outside the clutches of the big city machine. This nonsense about Americans unwilling to do jobs is for the birds. They are unwilling to do a lot of things at the minimum wage level, but how many jobs at the $20 - 25/ hour go unfilled for lack of want? </p>

<p>People &#8220;volunteer&#8221; for back breaking, very low wage farm work precisely because of the alernatives available to them in the society they live in. In the same way that people &#8220;volunteer&#8221; to be slaves. The slaves choice:work a slaves job or starve. We may be rapidly moving to this point in American society. Or have we come to this point already in America?</p>
