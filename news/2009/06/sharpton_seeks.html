<h1>Sharpton Seeks Help in Ariz. Sheriff&rsquo;s Abuse Probe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan J. Cooper, AP, June 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Rev. Al Sharpton on Friday called for opponents of an Arizona sheriff who has aggressively cracked down on illegal immigration to videotape alleged racial profiling by the sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>The civil rights leader said the videos will help the U.S. Department of Justice in an investigation of alleged civil rights abuses by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re gonna start some freedom rides around this county, to show how people of a certain skin color are treated different than other people,&#8221; Sharpton told a crowd of several hundred people at the Pilgrim Rest Baptist Church in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Sharpton spoke with Arpaio later Friday in a meeting that the sheriff called cordial.</p>
<p>Arpaio said Sharpton did not mention his freedom rides plan, but asked about racial profiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to educate him that we don&rsquo;t do it,&#8221; Arpaio said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics have said sheriff&rsquo;s deputies conducted racial profiling last spring during immigration and crime sweeps in some Latino areas in metropolitan Phoenix. The sweeps had led Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon to ask for a federal investigation of Arpaio for possible civil rights violations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio has said people pulled over in the sweeps were approached because deputies had probable cause to believe they had committed crimes.</p>
<p>The sheriff has taken a hard line against illegal immigration and strongly enforces Arizona&rsquo;s employer-sanctions law, which punishes businesses that knowingly hire illegal workers. He worked with Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas to use the state&rsquo;s human-smuggling law to charge illegal immigrants for conspiring to smuggle themselves into the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio said he told Sharpton that he would continue his immigration enforcement despite criticism and the civil rights investigation, adding that Sharpton &#8220;may have learned that maybe with this sheriff my people aren&rsquo;t as bad as he may read in the newspapers or as some politicians tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brandy Baron, a 53-year-old Arpaio supporter, said she&rsquo;s glad Arpaio agreed to meet with a harsh critic and called Sharpton &#8220;a loser who needs to mind his own business.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The sheriff should not be drawn into any &#8220;dialogue&#8221; with this Tawana Brawley hoaxer. Sharpton has  his own racist agenda and has no interest in learning about conditions in Arizona. It&rsquo;s telling that the only talk show Sharpton gets on regularly is mental midget &amp; pseudo-conservative Sean Hannity&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>     Expect the lefties to roll out the heavy artillery on this one. They&rsquo;ll try everything from character assassination, charges of racism, misuse of power, inhumane prison conditions, misappropriation of funds, etc. Arpaio would be a big feather in their caps and a warning to those who would dare crack down on illegals.     </p>

		<p>During an interview, Sharpton was the clown who would not call the Somali pirates what they were, after the hostage incident involving the American captain.  He stated they were Somali &#8220;coastguardsmen&#8221; just guarding their coast.</p>

		<p>Sharpton is the canary in the coal mine, so to speak. He is nothing more than proof that America is in danger. He is not a civil rights activist, but a liar and extortionist. His extortion is made possible by a society that has been poisened with far leftist ideology. This is what explains the existence of the Rev. Al&rsquo;, the Reverend Jessies, and others. They are all totally leftist created and empowered phenomenon.</p>

		<p>Sharpton&rsquo;s only agenda is publicity for himself and I doubt if he cares for anyone except himsef. Most blacks fail to realize illegal immigrants take jobs from them. And Mexicans and other illegals generally hold blacks in contempt. Yet most blacks side with illegals. Sheriff Joe is actually doing blacks a favor but most blacks fail to see it. Black leaders should be the loudest voices against illegal immigration, but I guess that kind of reasoning is too much for them. </p>

		<p>We all know about Al Sharpton&rsquo;s role in the Tawana Brawley&rsquo;s hoax but the Rev. Sharpton also played a role in the burning of a Jewish clothing store in Harlem that resulted in the death of 8 people.  Freddy&rsquo;s Fashion Mart, a Jewish-owned clothing store in Harlem was burned to the ground by blacks, killing 8 people. Al Sharpton led a group of picketers who picketed Freddy&rsquo;s Fashion Mart for months and finally set fire to the store. Owner Fred Harari was under seige for months solely based on the fact that he was Jewish. One of the fire&rsquo;s victim was Kareem Brunner, black security guard killed in the blaze. He had been called a &#8220;cracker lover.&#8221;  Al Sharpton was a major leader in this outrage and used terms such as &#8220;cracker&#8221; and &#8220;white interloper&#8221;.  A frequent expression was &#8220;We gonna see that this cracker suffers.&#8221;:<br>
Now the Rev.Sharpton is very concerned and wants Freedom riders and videos to protect these poor suspected illegal aliens.  Has anyone asked the Rev. Sharpton what he thought about the civil rights of Fred Harari and the 8 people who were killed when Freddy&rsquo;s Fashion Mart was burned to the ground?</p>

		<p>Sheriff Arpaio should dump Al Sharpton in the Grand Canyon. </p>
<p>I have watched this Clown, Sharpton, ruin New York City, and have it on edge with the Tawana Brawley Rape case that was a big lie, cooked up by the Three Stooges, Sharpton, Mason, and Maddox. </p>
<p>The last two Stooges were the Attorneys for Brawley.</p>
<p>I remember when the NYPD wanted to question Tawana Brawley about  what happened to her, and she and her mother decided to hold up in a Harlem Church, and demand &#8220;Justice&#8221;, all while refusing to cooperate with Police. </p>
<p>What &#8220;Victim&#8221; does that? It was obvious to anyone with half a brain that Brawley was making it all up, but the City still had that mood about it, everywhere, like something was about to happen. </p>
<p>This is was that fat Parasite, Sharpton, lives on. He feeds on this kind of tension and drama, to keep his ugly face in front of the cameras. </p>
<p>Sharpton did the same thing in 1986 when three Blacks were seen in Howard Beach, Queens, and were chased out of the Neighborhood. One of the Blacks ran across the Belt Parkway, and was hit by a car, which was driven by an off-Duty State Court Officer. </p>
<p>Of course, not missing a beat, Sharpton, Mason, and Maddox, in typical Stooge-style, accused the Court Officer of being part of the &#8220;Gang&#8221; that &#8220;decided to kill&#8221; the three &#8220;Innocent Blacks&#8221; and got into his car, and ran down the third Black, on the Parkway.</p>
<p>Never mind that the Court Officer was on his way home from work. No. That had no bearing on the alleged &#8220;Facts&#8221; according to these three Idiots. They wanted another Innocent man prosecuted, because he was White.</p>
<p>I have had more than enough of this pig, Sharpton. I wish he would go somewhere, and develop amnesia. Maybe he will never come back. </p>

		<p>GG at 6:01 got it wrong, Sharpton also gets on O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s show quite a bit. But the bigger disgrace is that Sharpton recently gave a tolerance and sensitvity lecture to people graduating from the NYC Police Academy at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. It would be great for Sharpton to go down to Arizona get arrested and spend a few weeks in Sheriff Joe&rsquo;s Tent City.</p>

		<p>I agree that O&rsquo;Reilly and Hannity should not have this  racist on their shows.  There are many good black guests that are not racists.  The 1987 Tawana Brawley hoax is reason enough. Sharpton has never apologized for his role in this outrage. He put Steve Pagones, a young prosecutor, through hell with his outrageous allegations of a rape of a 15 year old black girl  by several white men. He followed up the Tawana hoax by generating racial hate against a Jewish driver who accidentially hit and killed a black child who darted out into the street. He called the driver a &#8220;diamond merchant&#8221; - (code for Jews) with blood of innocent babies  on his  hands.  He led a mob shouting &#8220;no  justice,no peace&#8221; and &#8220;kill the Jews&#8221;.. The driver was stabbed to death. <br>
Then we have &#8220;Freddie Fashion Mart&#8221; where Sharpton incited another mob over a protracted period of  time because a Jewish man owned a clothing store in Harlem.Some protesters were shouting &#8220;Burn down the Jew store&#8221; and &#8220;WE&rsquo;re going  to see that this cracker suffers.&#8221;  Based on the  Sharpton led protest, one of the  protesters burst into the store and shot four  employees and set the  store on fire. Eight people died.<br>
Why is this  guy treated with any respect at all?</p>
