<h1>Racial Gap in Juvenile Arrests Called Wider</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brent Jones, Baltimore Sun, June 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-American children in Maryland are being arrested at a rate nearly three times higher than their white counterparts, a gap that continues to widen because of law enforcement practices and failures of school personnel to distinguish between delinquent behavior and children simply acting out, according to a report released Tuesday by a nonprofit group.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by Advocates for Children and Youth, is based on results of interviews with social service workers and information obtained from Maryland State Police from 2005 through 2008.</p>
<p>The report calculates the arrest rates for African-American and white children, and creates an index by dividing the two figures. An index of 1 would mean no difference in arrest rates between the two groups, while higher numbers show bigger discrepancies.</p>
<p>Maryland&rsquo;s figure is 2.74, the report said, up from 2.6 a year earlier and up 25 percent since 2005.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Joseph and other advocates say the reasons for the discrepancy begin at arrest, and that juveniles should be placed in an alternative environment rather than arrested if they show delinquent behavior. Steering them away from the criminal justice system, advocates say, would decrease the disparity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In schools, the study found, African-American students are more likely to be suspended than whites, creating a possible correlation between school-based behavior and juvenile arrests. The report suggests that school employees receive extensive training to distinguish between harmless acts and delinquent behavior.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>This is uberlib Maryland and uber-uberlib Baltimore we&rsquo;re talking about here.  There&rsquo;s no way that a black juvenile will be arrested for &#8220;acting out,&#8221; or for anything of a minor criminal nature; it&rsquo;s just too much of a hot potato for the cops.  I think the disparities here are widening because MD has fewer and fewer white juveniles, and therefore fewer arrests of white juveniles.</p>

		<p>&#8220;African-American children in Maryland are being arrested at a rate nearly three times higher than their white counterparts&#8221;</p>
<p>Then you can bet, looking at victim surveys, they are committing crimes at four and five times or more a greater rate.</p>

		<p>  If somehow everybody in the USA could magically turn the same color, even more of african Americans would have these problems, that being Schools, Police, ECT. could do their jobs without fear of being called a &#8220;racist&#8221;. &#8220;Content of character&#8221; seems to BE the problem here.</p>

<p>Again, ignore the Occam&rsquo;s Razor solution of <i>black children commit more crimes than their white counterparts</i> (which, strangely enough, happens in the F.B.I.&rsquo;s crime statistics too!) too blame &#8220;law enforcement practices&#8221; and other nonsense (yes, go ahead and insult both the victims of crime and the police by saying that the former are &#8220;lying&#8221; and the latter are wasting resources due to their &#8220;racism&#8221;).</p>
<p><i>and failures of school personnel to distinguish between delinquent behavior and children simply acting out, according to a report released Tuesday by a nonprofit group.</i></p>
<p>Is &#8220;acting out&#8221; the P.C. term for uncontrolled, spoilt brats causing mischief because they <b>know</b> deep down that no-one will punish them without being hauled away to jail?</p>
<p><i>In schools, the study found, African-American students are more likely to be suspended than whites, creating a possible correlation between school-based behavior and juvenile arrests.</i></p>
<p>Occam&rsquo;s Razor strikes again.</p>

<p>Yeah, white folk just can&rsquo;t understand the difference between a thug and black boys being black boys.</p>
<p>IS there a difference?</p>
<p>No. Bad black behavior is universal thug behavior. Everywhere. Every place. Every time.</p>
<p>If blacks believe this is an issue, blacks should be monitoring black boys in BLACK schools. If blacks can see the subtle differences that whites can&rsquo;t, blacks should take on responsibility.</p>
<p>The reason blacks won&rsquo;t is because blacks know how bad black behavior is and they know they can&rsquo;t prevent it. If they keep forcing whites to deal with it, they can keep blaming whites for the problem.</p>
<p>What was that t-shirt popular with blacks? Oh yeah, the one that read, &#8220;Thug For Life&#8221;. Too true.</p>

		<p>So they only have to be put in a different environment; as in Brown v. Board: Blacks are traumatized by the company of undesirables (i.e. their own) and cannot therefore achieve (thatÂ´s the actual reasoning!). To my knowledge, the only official study to find any improvement from deseg measures was the follow-up study on housing vouchers (=what is now Section 8).<br>
Black girls registered a not very significant improvement in academic scores, and their mothers reported sleeping better (as usual, no one deigned to ask the White mothers how they slept).<br>
Black boys became about twice as criminal (fewer drug, more property offenses).</p>

<p>I take it that they&rsquo;re referring to the &#8220;practice&#8221; of arresting people who commit crimes?</p>
<p>&#8220;Steering them away from the criminal justice system, advocates say, would decrease the disparity.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re right.  Not arresting black criminals would undoubtedly decrease the disparity.  Great idea&hellip;</p>

<p>All due, of course, to having ancestors as slaves two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Amazing isn&rsquo;t it, how a condition that is centuries old still affects people today by causing their I.Q.&rsquo;s to be lower, a lack of impulse control, a propensity for crime and violence, and a lack of desire to work and learn?</p>
<p>Truly amazing.   <br>

		<p>Ever been in a majority black high school? I have. The noise is deafening. Black males mostly, but some females, walk out of classrooms at will. Unexcused absenteeism is rampant, meaning these kids are out on the streets or home smoking dope with their friends all day. There is no interest in math or English. Most students spend the day texting each other, playing video games on expensive ipods, or calling friends on the phone. A majority of most classes should be expelled, let alone suspended. </p>
<p>But principals know the school will not pass muster under the Kennedy/Bush No Child Left Behind Act if the suspension rate or the dropout rate is too high. So idiots and laggards are passed,not suspended. </p>
<p>Even so, with all the bending over backwards to favor blacks despite atrocious inschool behavior,  many black males are suspended because of fighting, unbelievable absenteesim, threats and assaults on teachers, and invasions of classes where the &#8220;youngster&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t belong. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the statistics being complained of are far too small; that thousands of infractions a day in our schools committed by blacks warrant suspension. But nothing is done in many cases because of &#8220;sensitivity&#8221;.</p>

<p>It sounds like you read the most recent print edition of AR.  I would venture to guess that the only reason many of the black male teenagers even attend high school is because they&rsquo;re on juvenile or adult probation because they committed a crime, and the &#8220;P.O.&#8221; makes them go to school or else The Big House.</p>

		<p>Only liberals and blacks actually believe that you can improve black childrens behavior by enforcing the rules less!  Until blacks are treated like every other race, nothing will change.  It will only get worse. How long will we let them &#8220;guilt&#8221; us into giving them whatever they want, no matter the consequences??  The mindset is just like teen behavior- nothing is ever their fault. The rules don&rsquo;t apply to them.<br>
I have a suggestion- how about better parenting?  It&rsquo;s hard to instill proper values in children when you&rsquo;re spending most of your time drinking, doing drugs, etc. usually in full view of the kids</p>

		<p>To Question Diverstiy:</p>
<p>I wish I had read the latest print AR, but I don&rsquo;t subscribe as I&rsquo;ve had to cut back of memberships and subscriptions due to current economic problems. I&rsquo;m sure the article was quite informative. No, my observations were based on first hand, on the ground, up front and close interaction with these fine black scholars in the rotting public high schools of Liberal Maryland.<br>
Socialist Governor O&rsquo;Malley constantly pours more dough into this rotting structure backed by a Board of Education that openly favors Black areas like Baltimore, Prince George County, outside DC, and Montgomery a formerly excellent system near DC which is sliding into chaos as the County welcomed illegal hispanics and low income blacks into its formerly great schools and nice neighborhood. Maryland is committing suicide.</p>

		<p>from the article - a gap that continues to widen because of law enforcement practices and failures of school personnel to distinguish between delinquent behavior and children simply acting out</p>
<p>The rate of school suspensions for black students is higher all across the nation and coincides with the higher rate of criminal violence found amongst black adults. Are all school administrators and police across the country confused and mistaken or is the higher incidence of black anti-social behavior very real? The answer is obvious and the only ones who are confused here are the egalitarians who refuse to accept what is plain as day to the rest of us about the higher rate of black anti-social behavior.<br>

<p>Of course, that datum would be meaningless if we disregard the obvious reality&hellip; that Blacks are THREE times more likely to be guilty of accused criminal acts, than their White counterparts. Public admission of the truth, that Blacks are far more likely to gravitate to criminal behavior&hellip; is a politically incorrect statement to make.

		<p>Over two decades ago, a colleague carried a piece cut from a London local newspaper which quoted a social worker giving evidence in favor of one of her [!] charges:</p>
<p>&#8220;These boys wouldn&rsquo;t have such bad criminal records if the police didn&rsquo;t keep arresting them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gimme a Break!</p>
<p>Schools are under tremendous pressure not to suspend blacks or other NAMs.  Do these idiots really believe blacks are suspended and/or arrested for &#8216;acting out&rsquo; (whatever that means) and not for outright crimes such as robbery, theft, rape, extortion, vandalism, assault  &mdash;  all of which occur regularly on black-majority campuses? </p>
<p>I regularly saw major crimes explained away with such comments as &#8216;boys will be boys&rsquo; or worse, ALL high schools are just like this!  Can you imagine if ALL high schools were marked by total anarchy and bloody, vicious fights two-three times/day every day?</p>
<p>Blacks are clearly given the message at school that they do not have to follow rules or listen to authorities because they (black youth) have all the power.  This message is learned along with the educational system teaching them that they are poor and oppressed because of White racism.<br>
 <br>
This attitude is carried out into the larger world making them unemployable and terrible problems for police.</p>
<p>Worse, however, is the tyranny and reign of terror under which the government schools operate:  </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The belief that people have the same biological potential for accomplishment and no culture is better than any other&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>To suggest otherwise is heresy, will open one to charges of racism and promoting White supremacy, and will put one&rsquo;s career in jeopardy.  ANY disparate impact in test scores, suspension rates, arrest rates, is due to racism and/or bias.</p>
<p>And this from QD:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I would venture to guess that the only reason many of the black male teenagers even attend high school is because they&rsquo;re on juvenile or adult probation&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>DH spent one year in the offices of a black-majority school as an administrator.  He said there were two full-time POs assigned to the campus  &mdash;  each with his own desk.</p>
<p>Regular visits from PO officers are quite common.  Many teachers (moi included) kept the POs cards on our desk.  Teachers in these schools know a threat to call home is meaningless  &mdash;  a threat to call the PO carries much more power.</p>
