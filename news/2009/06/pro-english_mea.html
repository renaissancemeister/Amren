<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31176525/ns/us_news-life/">Pro-English Measures Being Revived Across U.S.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Johnson, MSNBC, June 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In perfect, if Southern-inflected, Japanese, Eric Crafton urged his colleagues on the Nashville, Tenn., City Council to let voters decide whether English should be the city&rsquo;s official language.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The council&rsquo;s decision to put the measure on the city ballot set off a bitter and expensive campaign, with Crafton and supporters from the nation&rsquo;s &#8220;official English&#8221; movement pitted against the mayor, the governor of Tennessee and the leaders of numerous religious and community groups.</p>
<p>Nashville voters rejected the measure in January, but it won the support of 43 percent of them. Had they prevailed, Nashville would have become the largest city in the country to require that its official government business be conducted solely in English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Numerous campaigns across country</b></p>
<p>The movement to make English the official language of U.S. government seems to run in cycles, and for now it&rsquo;s back. Since the beginning of the year, four bills to that effect have been introduced in Congress, with versions of the idea included as part of at least three other bills. Meanwhile, similar measures have been introduced in at least 10 of the 22 states that don&rsquo;t already have such provisions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, however, programs across the country that help immigrants learn English are facing budget cuts because of the recession, which could pose a conundrum if some of the measures succeed.</p>

		<p>Nashville, the proper city, has a very low white population.  That&rsquo;s why I think English failed.  People have an image of Nashville as hick hillbilly white full of &#8220;country&#8221; (i.e. warmed over pop) music singers and hee haw guitar pickers.  Which is of course a pejorative characterization of the whites, but as the case may be, most of the whites live in suburban counties, especially since Nashville and Davidson County are legally one.  And the country music singers that have done well and still live in the area generally live on big estates in the outer suburbs or exurbs, not in Nashville itself.</p>
<p>For the record, English only laws are basically useless.  Miami has an English only law, look at how well it worked.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that laws to make English the &#8216;official&rsquo; language are desirable in any context. It will only force vastly different and incompatible peoples together, all for the sake of quick profits. There&rsquo;s a much better solution   &mdash;   &#8216;good fences make good neighbors&rsquo;. People should be able to have their own separate communities with their own languages. The fact that they can&rsquo;t communicate is an obvious sign that they shouldn&rsquo;t be living together in the first place. Plus, linguistic homogenization will increase the likelihood of racial homogenization.</p>

		<p>Sounds like a grand idea, but&hellip;over twenty years ago, in 1986, the voters of California enacted by electoral initiative a constitutional amendment making English the official language of California.  (Has everyone stopped laughing yet so I can continue?) It didn&rsquo;t make any difference - there&rsquo;re all sorts of state laws requiring for example that voter ballots and pamphlets be made available in Vietnamese, Chinese, Tagalog&hellip;and of course Spanish.  You&rsquo;d think that someone who wanted to vote would make the effort, or be made to make the effort, to learn the &#8220;official language&#8221; first&hellip;  <p>Even when initiatives like official English and elimination of so-called affirmative action pass and survive challenges, they&rsquo;re ignored by the powers that be.  Our traitorous political class is determined to wrest control of America from its citizens -especially its white citizens- and citizen initiatives aren&rsquo;t going to stop them.</p></p>

		<p>An English only law would make it easier for the minority ENGLISH SPEAKING WHITE taxpaying slaves to understand government documents (at least those that CAN be understood)</p>

		<p>English only laws only work if they are enforced. This means all government documents in English, all government work in english. If you need a translator, you pay for it, Pablo, not us.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity: Wouldn&rsquo;t an English-only law exempt schools from being forced to provide teaching materials in Spanish, or having to hire Spanish translators for all activities?</p>

		<p>As a Canadian, I feel I must warn Americans (again) that language issues are very dangerous. Bilingualism, the Spanish language, these are real Trojan horses. Beware.</p>
