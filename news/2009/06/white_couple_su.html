			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scotland on Sunday, June 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A WHITE couple are suing a Northern Ireland fertility clinic after an IVF blunder left them with a mixed race baby.</p>
<p>The man and wife, who wish to remain anonymous, claim their lives have been devastated by suggestions of extra marital affairs.</p>
<p>In what is believed to the first case of its kind in the UK, they are seeking damages against the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust in a case expected to begin in September.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t love my children more than if I had fathered them myself,&#8221; the father said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are gorgeous kids and I&rsquo;d rather die than not have them, but this mistake has devastated our family and almost destroyed our marriage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t go out together because people openly stare at us.</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife has been asked if she&rsquo;s had an affair with an Indian man on holiday. In public, she&rsquo;ll shrug it off. But in private, she&rsquo;s often in tears.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 47-year-old businessman and his 46-year-old wife started treatment at the Regional Fertility Centre at Belfast&rsquo;s Royal Victoria Hospital in 1998.</p>
<p>Although they requested &#8220;white Caucasian&#8221; donor sperm, the woman was fertilised with &#8220;Caucasian cape coloured&#8221; sperm and gave birth to a dark-skinned boy, now aged 10.</p>
<p>The clinic apologised to the couple in October 2003 but the couple have fought a long protracted case for damages.<br>

		<p>I hardly believe this was a mistake considering what is going on in White Western Built Countries! </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would have kept the child after birth. I do believe it would have been up for adoption that may sound harsh but look at what the couple has been subjected to by strangers! </p>

		<p>How much you wanna bet this was done intentionally?  Now we have a new angle in the war on whites.  Trick couples with infertility problems into having non-white children.  That&rsquo;s one fewer &#8220;evil&#8221; white persons in the world and one more non-white.  The racists don&rsquo;t care what devastation they wreak on whites.  Anything to advance their agenda of &#8220;abolishing the white race by any means necessary.&#8221;  R.K.S.</p>

		<p>That woman should never have gone the IBF route. Rather she should have divorced that loser and found herself a healthy white man. But judging by hubby&rsquo;s clueless, denatured response, she likely was not the sort to want a normal man in her life.</p>

		<p>They should have done something about it the minute he was born. Why did they not put him up for adoption and then proceed to sue? They are now a mixed race family and nothing will change that fact. Altruism is the downfall of the White race, since they are the only race that has this genetic defect, which is mainly used on other races and not their own, as it was intended..</p>

		<p>How irresponsible of the parents themselves!  </p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they choose a sperm donor carefully?  I mean, even if the sperm donor had been white, that&rsquo;s all the parents knew about the sperm donor?  His race?  </p>
<p>They should have gone to the sort of sperm bank where you can carefully choose your sperm donor, that is know what his IQ and occupation are, look at his photo, etc.  </p>
<p>You have to put lots of thought in picking out who the father of your child will be.  </p>
<p>I agree, they should not have accepted the mixed race baby.  It&rsquo;s not the poor child&rsquo;s fault, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very very awkward to look different from your parents.  Everyone would assume you were adopted, or apparently in this case, that you were the product of an illicit affair.  </p>

		<p>  Look at the age of this couple: a 47 year old husband and a 46 year old wife.  A little late to be trying to start a family, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?  Hence all the &#8220;in vitro fertilization&#8221; (IVF) treatments.  She still managed to give birth at this age, but that&rsquo;s rare.  </p>
<p>  What whites used to know, and it&rsquo;s a simply a matter of biology, is that a woman&rsquo;s fertility begins to decline after age 25.  By the age of 40, it&rsquo;s very hard for a woman to conceive.  Not to mention their having a greater chance of kids with birth defects, and risky childbirths. One study shows that by age 45, 87 percent of couples are infertile.</p>
<p>  Feminism has convinced millions of white women across the world to put the cart before the horse: delay having a family for as long as possible, get your advanced degrees and career first.  Shows like &#8220;Sex in the City&#8221; and books like &#8220;Eat, Pray, Love&#8221; promote these ideas.  They are teaching millions of women to find themselves in: careers, MBA degrees, Cosmos with their girlfriends; screwing around with men they don&rsquo;t take seriously; traveling to exotic locales; and finding a vaguely defined sense of &#8220;fulfillment.&#8221;</p>
<p>   At a certain point, many of these white women who bought into the myths of modern feminism start to realize it might be nice to settle down and have a family.  At that point, many are left barren and/or spinsters.  That this biological reality exists with the sexes may be deplorable, but it&rsquo;s also deplorable that we all must die.  As Horace famously is quoted among racial realists: &#8220;You may drive Mother Nature out with a pitchfork, yet she will hurry back in.&#8221;</p>
<p>   By contrast, most nonwhite women are not following the feminist advice of &#8220;family last.&#8221;  Instead, they are generally reproducing at an astronomical rate.  Some nonwhite women are starting to get &#8220;modern&#8221; and delay having families   &mdash;   typically the ones with the higher IQ&rsquo;s   &mdash;   only further adding to a worldwide dysgenic effect.</p>
<p>   There is another aspect which isn&rsquo;t considered either: the child will grow up having some very old parents.  By the time the child reaches their 30s, their parents will be quite old, perhaps even deceased.  Many will never be around long enough to see their grandchildren.  This is another factor which never gets talked about.</p>
<p>   It is also true that many white males deserve some share of the blame for the predicament we are in.  By letting in so much nonwhite &#8220;cheap labor&#8221; to the West over the past 40 or so years, they are now finding they too have to delay marriage and family more and more.  The cost of raising a white family is so much more expensive now, when you have to pay the huge tax burden to support so many nonwhites, move to expensive suburbs to get away from the nonwhites, distract yourself with ESPN and video games on giant TV screens, etc., etc. </p>
<p>   However, this doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that the &#8220;Window of Opportunity&#8221; for a white woman to have a family is a very narrow one.  Women can always find time later on in their lives to pursue other interests: the late Jeane Kirkpatrick is a marvelous example of a woman who put her family first, and after they were out of the nest, pursued advanced academics, career, etc.  The misfortune of this Irish couple in their 40s should serve as a cautionary tale for all whites.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a bit surprising the couple involved isn&rsquo;t being called racist. In my experience, in day to day life, that&rsquo;s what regular folks would be called, even Noticing the baby is another color, let alone complaining it&rsquo;s the wrong color. </p>

		<p>In response to the first comment, I am a white woman having to visit the dr. to conceive.  Although, I have two dogs that are treated better than most children, my husband and I feel it is our duty to do a little more than take in dogs.  We feel it is our obligation to pass on our white genes, do more than replace ourselves, and contribute to future generations of whites.  I appreciate the flippant attitude (you must either effortlessy have a household of children or are &#8220;opting out&#8221; of parenthood), this is a battle you never expect to have to fight.  If you can easily conceive, count your blessings.  For those who easily advise, just adopt&hellip;you do not HAVE to be infertile to adopt a white baby.  An adopted white child would make a great addition to any household.</p>

Does anyone know if there&rsquo;s any scientific basis to <br>

<p>There is no scientific basis for this idea.  Every ovum is an individual one that has to travel down the fallopian tubes to the uterus to be fertilized by a one time sperm injection.  The ovums that will later arrive in the uterus in the future are not contacted by that sperm and the ovary is not alterred in the least bit.</p>
<p>However, there has been a social taint and one could argue, a spiritual one.  I have always believed that a person&rsquo;s spirit, or psychological well being is influenced by not only who you socialize with, but much more - who you lay down with.  Since this woman did not &#8220;lay down&#8221; with the man who donated the sperm, this situation jumps off the &#8220;Old Racialism&#8221; chart.</p>
<p>I agree with the poster who wonders why an Irish fertility clinic is accepting and storing non-Irish genetic sperm.  And I would suspect that the error, is some flaming liberals &#8220;little joke.&#8221;</p>

		<p>That newspaper link is not the whole story.  There is far more to the supposed blunder than that.</p>

<p>Mention was made of the couple&rsquo;s hometown being a  <i>predominately white area</i> and as we all know, the Marxist Liberal elite will not tolerate the natural fact that ancestral white homelands are supposed to be majority white - such is the depth of their anti-white race hatred and peverted outlook.</p>
<p>They will, of course tolerate South America, the African continent, the Indian sub-continent and the Far East being naturally majority indigenous non-white.</p>
<p>I would say that this <i>mistake</i> was indeed deliberate.<br>

		<p>Some of the comments here are extremely disturbing&hellip;how many of the posters here have not started a family themselves?  How many are sitting at home alone instead of pursuing women in this country or Eastern Europe? (where there are plenty of young, Caucasian, fertile women ready to start families).  A lot of women are putting off children because Americans are forced by an oppressive Federal government to have two incomes to support an average household&hellip;while they give the fruits of our labor to the non-whites who are flooding across the border.</p>
<p>If you guys are reading this and are single, go get out there and find yourself a nice woman and start procreating so we can keep up with the hordes who are out breeding us. If you are older and need IVF to get some children then so much the better&hellip;<br>

		<p>The world needs more whites and the fact that some of you are suggesting that this mistake is a lesson indicating that whites should not use IVF is frighteningly surprising. Millions of children have been born via IVF and the risk of something like this happening is almost nil. </p>
<p>After many miscarriages, my wife and I used IVF to produce two beautiful baby girls. We did not adopt because adoptions (no matter the race) are often a genetic grab bag, you often cannot be sure how their genes (which are a mystery) will affect their health and personality as they grow. Neither do adoptions add to the number of whites on the planet. With IVF we used an egg donor (with careful screening, IQ testing, psychological testing, etc) and my sperm. Our children are smart, healthy and stable. </p>
<p>More whites should use IVF, not less.  &#8220;Try getting a dog&#8221;? Indeed.</p>

		<p>I agree with those comments regarding feminism and the lies we as women have been told regarding careers and having children. We&rsquo;ve been sold a bill of goods.  It&rsquo;s our responsibility to raise this next generation and to reproduce.</p>
<p>We married when I was 27 and though it was later than I&rsquo;d hoped to marry, I found a most wonderful man who awakened in me a pride in my heritage and culture.  We have 3 beautiful little girls but only the first child was conceived naturally.  After many miscarriages we turned to IVF.  We had a strong desire to not only be parents but also help our cause by adding healthy, intelligent, wholesome white children to this world.  I find comments like &#8220;get a dog&#8221; to be tasteless and hurtful.  It was not my fault I could not carry most of my children to term.  It had nothing to do with my age - according to the specialists.  After being in the IVF community for several years now, I can say that the majority of women having children through IVF (that I have personally known) where all younger women.  I understand that this couple is in a horrible bind.  How do you carry a child for 9 months and then just give it away?  I understand if you are unwed or in a terrible marriage but if the child were healthy?  It&rsquo;s difficult to say what I would have done.  I know my husband would have had a heart attack.  He would not want to raise this Cuckoo bird child.  It&rsquo;s a travesty.  If it was done on purpose, it&rsquo;s criminal!  </p>
<p>Also:  Sperm donation is carefully regulated and the men have to meet many requirements in order to donate.  Most people use an intelligent donor database.  This service is used primarily for couples who have chromosomal issues or low sperm counts.  </p>
