			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allison Pearson, Daily Mail (London), June 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On a train to London, a young woman wearing a burkha, with only her heavily made-up eyes peeping out, did not have a valid ticket.</p>
<p>Challenged by the guard, the young woman gave a litany of excuses. She had left her bag at her boyfriend&rsquo;s, he had bought the ticket, she had no money on her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>My friend Jane, who was in the same carriage, noticed how the guard became nervous as the Muslim girl presented herself as an innocent in a society she didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Instead of issuing a penalty fine, the guard backed off, shrugging his helplessness at the other passengers.</p>
<p>So imagine my friend&rsquo;s surprise when she got off at the same station as burkha girl and saw this &#8216;penniless innocent&rsquo; whip out a credit card from under the folds of her dress with which she promptly bought a Tube ticket.</p>
<p>Jane was so incensed she sent me a text message, explaining what she&rsquo;d witnessed. It ended: &#8216;Attack of Burkha Rage. Grrr.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane is not a BNP voter. She is a university lecturer who specialises in the developing world.</p>
<p>Yet Burkha Rage has become our personal shorthand for someone taking the mickey out of our country and its tolerant ways.</p>
<p>Despite a growing acceptance that multi-culturalism has been deeply damaging to race relations, there are still almost weekly opportunities for a fit of Burkha Rage.</p>
<p>Look at Fata Lemes, the Muslim bar waitress who won £3,000 compensation this week for quitting her job after she objected to wearing a red cocktail dress.</p>
<p>Apologies if I find it hard to keep a straight face, but my jaw keeps dropping open. Miss Lemes took the job in a bar and left after eight days, claiming managers asked her to wear a dress that made her look like a prostitute.</p>
<p>Actually, the frock is conservative by London bar standards  &mdash;  more Petersfield garden party than Peter Stringfellow. But fair enough if Miss Lemes didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>What was not fair enough was her demand for £20,000 compensation.</p>
<p>An employment tribunal found that Miss Lemes had &#8216;overstated her trauma&rsquo;. You can say that again. Her compensation claim was &#8216;manifestly absurd&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yet instead of telling the 33-year-old to grow up and accept that a British city bar is not readily confused with a convent, the tribunal awarded her £2,919.95.</p>
<p>As a Bosnian Muslim, it said, she &#8216;holds views about modesty and decency which some might think unusual in Britain in the 21st century&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They might think it was unusual if they had spotted that modest flower Miss Lemes on Facebook wearing a vest top with a gaping cleavage. But that image was not produced in court.</p>
<p>How exactly are British employers supposed to avoid hurting the feelings of grievance-mongers like Fata Lemes?</p>
<p>Imagine a job interview where a bar manager dared to suggest that a Muslim woman might not feel at ease in their uniform. Before you could say &#8216;Mine&rsquo;s a Cosmopolitan&rsquo;, Miss Lemes would have sued for discrimination.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid Fata Lemes is no better than the girl dodging the train fare. Both are quick to hide behind their religious identity and play the victim. Both are happy to embarrass their host nation into ignoring common sense.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: there are millions of British Muslims who respect our cultural norms. It&rsquo;s the minority of opportunists who provoke Burkha Rage.</p>
<p>You see it from time to time: the Muslim shop assistant who refused to serve a woman buying First Bible Stories for her grandson because it was &#8216;unclean&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And the disgraceful capitulation of Sainsbury&rsquo;s to Islamic checkout staff who refused to sell alcohol.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown, a recent convert to Britishness, has promised that the emphasis for immigrants must be on fitting in, learning our ways and our language.</p>
<p>Yet, only yesterday, a Metropolitan Police chief admitted the bill for translation services for criminals and victims was set to soar to a staggering £20million by 2012.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard blames a growth in 50 distinct communities of more than 10,000 people and having to deal with more than 300 languages.</p>
<p>At no point in the statement is there any mention of compulsory English lessons.</p>
<p>No suggestion of people needing to fit in with our ways, rather than us with theirs. I feel a small attack of Burkha Rage coming on.<br>

		<p>Anything to put something over on the unsuspecting public. The burkah clad was probably lying to get on the train for free&hellip; Muslim women are not susposed to have &#8220;boyfriends&#8221;, especially if they have their faces covered. Ditto for the Bosnian &#8220;Muslim&#8221; who quit her job because the owners wanted her to wear clothing appropriate to the job. I guess that Muslims have jumped on the &#8220;ghetto lottery&#8221; train. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that most of the trouble making &#8216;muslims&rsquo; in Britain and the U.S. are BLACK muslims and the teach each other how to play the system, but YEAH!! muslims are on the gravy train of White taxpaying slaves in EVERY Western country.</p>

		<p>They haven&rsquo;t seen anything in Britain yet.  This is just the beginning.  You know it&rsquo;s going to get worse - much, much, worse.  I feel sorry for the British.</p>

		<p>Islam is the eternal enemy of the West, as well as the chief ideological cover for the coming global war of racial annihilation directed at whites (note I say &lsquo;whites&rsquo; not Aryans, because our modern, non-white racial enemies do not distinguish between Jews and Aryans in their hatred for both groups). The Muslim is the battering ram destroying Europe, through passive demographics, and active terrorism. There can be no alliance with Muslims, as they are the fastest growing demographic in the world, while our race is shrinking rapidly, and, in their fundamentalist guise, literally insane; in other words, they have no need to ally with us. They are coming to conquer us. They lust after power, initially, to steal the white man&rsquo;s wealth and women, and eventually, to preside over the eternal darkness of an Islamic planet. No self-respecting European could ever tolerate Islam. It is profoundly alien to our minds, and utterly lacking in any joy or appreciation of that which makes life worth living.</p>
<p>Islam, however, meaning militant opposition to it, is the key to the West&rsquo;s survival. Why? As I have long observed, Western Man is Ethical Man. If he is to survive, he must have a universally valid justification (to satisfy his own ethicality, esp in adopting the hard, coercive measures which, physically, practically, are necessary for white racial survival; please, let no one imagine our race is going to endure without some applications of force, somewhere, even if done legally: eg, a nationalist government rounding up aliens for deportation; some will resist violently, at which point we must be prepared to shoot them). For the moment, for most whites as a sociological matter, racialist opposition to merely passive, State-allowed/encouraged race-replacement is not seen to be ethically acceptable, esp if it should involve violence. Many whites may dislike immigration, multiculturalism, etc, but they lack an ethical philosophy justifying their &ldquo;prejudices&rdquo;. We may oppose race-mixing, for example, but if &ldquo;those two people love each other&rdquo; &hellip; who are we, most whites will say, to outlaw their attachment? I have a different view of ethics, and find it perfectly appropriate for a community to enact race-preservationist laws (the REAL traditionalist view in the West). But, again, at this historical juncture, most of my fellow whites disagree, while meanwhile each day we lose our homelands a little more, with the time in which to recover them running out &hellip;.</p>
<p>Islam changes this paralytic situation, precisely because it is a religion/ideology, and one historically hostile and confrontational towards Christianity. It is much easier to form an acceptable ethical justification for confrontation with Islam, than with black America, or hispanic immigrants. Islam and Muslim immigrants constitute the chief threat to Europe; they are also the easiest threat against which to develop an ethic of militant resistance, esp in the US post-9/11. We in the West can either believe in God, or not. If no God, then no ethics, at least applied outside tribal bounds. But if we believe in God (as most white Americans in fact do), then that God is usually the Christian one. Thus, in opposing Islam, we can pose as defenders of Christ and His Church. That is a very powerful place to be, far more so than that occupied by whites who merely are racists not wanting to be integrated with blacks or other minorities (not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that, either, but the ethical justification is neither as strong nor as obvious).</p>
<p>But if we could get vast numbers of whites militantly confrontational with Islam, that aroused fury could easily then be turned in other directions &hellip; The point is that the West is dying because the white man has lost his racial will to endure, which in turn is due to ethical confusion. But once the white man can be induced to &ldquo;come out fighting&rdquo; again, that newly re-martialized spirit can be expected to carry over into other zones of racial conflict &hellip; What is needed is that initial spark leading towards the revivification of white will, said spark, however, needing an ethical grounding, so to speak, which Islam preeminently provides.</p>

		<p>The fault lies with the authorities.</p>
<p>If they had the balls to stand up and say NO then muslims wouldn&rsquo;t try it on. The message, however, that is sent out is that WE must give ground to them. We are racists if we do not adopt their ways, they are not racist if they do not adopt ours.</p>
<p>Consequently Local Authorities &#8220;celebrate&#8221; afro-carribean, muslim and hindu events/religious holidays and yet try to ban Christmas/Easter as it will &#8220;offend&#8221; or ban British events like St Georges Day as it is &#8220;not inclusive/racist&#8221;. </p>
<p>That is why so many - and in increasing numbers, are joining/voting BNP.</p>

		<p>As a Californian White who often visits London, I find   &mdash;  - despite the city being awash with third-worlders and hostile Muslims   &mdash;  - that it&rsquo;s quite refreshing to be served at restaurants, hotels, ticket offices etc. by staff that include many Eastern-Europeans. While I understand the evils of the EU, that to me is still a refreshing departure from the US, in which so many of these jobs have been taken over by Mexicans and other non-Whites, who also add insult to injury by often speaking broken English. As for these Muslim grievance mongers, I would advise the native Brits to not put up with this. If enough people treated White-guilt as they would a native-born person employing corresponding tactics, the court system would buckle under the shear weight of these frivolous cases.</p>

<p>I think the greater problem confronting the U.S. and ANY civilized Christian country is Islam. However, I also believe that another MAJOR problem for White taxpaying slave U.S. citizens, is political treachery by our own government officials at EVERY LEVEL. Their vote pandering and surrender to illegals and muslims will have far, long reaching and very possibly, violent consequences.</p>
