<h1>England: The Peasants Are Revolting</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Gabb, VDARE, June 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>So far as I can tell from England, the American media gives little real coverage to events in the United Kingdom. Either events are not covered at all, or they are covered without enough context to give them meaning. I think this has been the case with the results of the European elections and the <a href="https://www.nypost.com/seven/05252009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/the_mother_of_all_british_scandals_170832.htm">House of Commons expenses scandal</a> that is said to have led to these election results.</p>
<p><b>The European Elections</b></p>
<p>Let me begin with the facts. On Thursday the 4th June 2009, the British people voted in elections to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament.</a> This is supposed to be the legislative body of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union">European Union</a>, and it has around 750 Members, of whom 78 are from Britain. It has no meaningful functions, and its only effect is to give a democratic veneer to a multinational federation that cannot by its nature be democratically governed. Despite the best efforts of the pro-Establishment BBC, hardly anyone takes European elections as other than an excuse to pass judgement on the government of the day.</p>
<p>The results came out on Sunday, 7th June. The ruling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)">Labour Party,</a> with 15.7 per cent, got its lowest share of the vote in any national election since 1918. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)">Conservatives</a> won the largest share, with 27.7 per cent. They are celebrating their victory  &mdash;  but this is hardly the sort of percentage share of the vote that promises a Commons majority in a general election. It may be that the 16.5 per cent won by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Independence_Party">UK Independence Party</a> would probably go to the Conservatives in a general election. But it did not go to them in the European elections.</p>
<p>The result may have been to complete the disintegration of the Labour Government. Already in trouble, the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, may now have little choice but to resign.</p>
<p>The main shock, however, has been the election of Nick Griffin and one other British National Party candidate to the European Parliament. The BNP <a href="https://bnp.org.uk/policies/immigration/">stands for</a> a complete halt to non-white immigration, expulsion of illegal immigrants and voluntary repatriation of non-whites legally here. It also believes in an end to multiculturalism and political correctness, and in withdrawal from the European Union.</p>
<p>These were the first victories for the BNP in any national election, and they have been greeted by the British media and political class with hysterical rage. The favoured explanation is that the BNP  &mdash;  plus UKIP and the other small parties that did so well in the European elections  &mdash;  is to blame the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclosure_of_expenses_of_Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament">House of Commons expenses scandal.</a> The idea that people might have voted as they did because they liked what they saw cannot be entertained.</p>
<p><b>The Expenses Scandal</b></p>
<p>But, rather than just sneer at its use as smokescreen, let me explain something about the expenses scandal. Members of the House of Commons are allowed to claim expenses that are <b>&#147;wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred for the performance of a Member&rsquo;s parliamentary duties.&#148;</b> This is supposed to mean that a Member who lives in  Scotland or some other distant part of the country can claim for the cost of running a second home in London, and for travel between London and his constituency. Because payment of expenses has been confidential, and because receipts have not always been required, the system has been open to abuse. For several years, occasional stories have been appearing in the establishment media about abuses of the House of Commons expenses system that amount to fraud. These have been only occasional stories. They have usually caused a few days of comment, and then been forgotten. Then, <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1179578/Police-hunt-expenses-mole-businessman-hawks-details-MPs-receipts.html">obtained a disc</a> giving a million pages of expenses claims going back over the past four years. Every day since the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5297557/MPs-expenses-Weve-been-paying-too-much-for-Labours-morality-for-too-long.html">8th May 2009, <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite></a> has been <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5297557/MPs-expenses-Weve-been-paying-too-much-for-Labours-morality-for-too-long.html">publishing details</a> of the more lurid and fraudulent claims.</p>
<p>Examples of these claims have been:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span lang="EN-GB">Nominating and renominating second homes.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> As said, expenses are paid to cover the costs of running a second home. Running costs include renovations. Members have used the rules to designate as their second home whichever of their two properties was most in need of work. This might be their home in London or in their constituency. Many have then nominated their other property as their second home to claim for a fresh set of renovations.</span></li></ul>
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span lang="EN-GB">Subsidised property development.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> Several Members have pushed these rules to the limit. They have bought derelict properties, nominated them as second homes to claim the full cost of improvements, then have sold them at profits that are free of tax.</span></li></ul>
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"> <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span lang="EN-GB">Subsidised luxury.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> Even without profiting from a rising property market, Members have been claiming for expenses not reasonably incurred for the performance of their parliamentary duties. <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite> has published details of claims for landscape gardening, for tampons, for cosmetics, for trouser presses  &mdash;  even for court fines and for charitable donations.</span></li></ul>
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"> <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span lang="EN-GB">Possible fraud.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> Several Members have been caught overclaiming for Council Tax, or <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5451542/MPs-expenses-Elliot-Morley-and-David-Chaytor-face-police-investigation.html">claiming for payments</a> on mortgages already paid off. In a disclosure separate from <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite> publications, one senior Minister was shown to have claimed for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7201202"> the cost of renting pornographic videos for her husband</a>. It is likely that some of the non-receipted expenses were for prostitution services or the purchase of recreational drugs.</span></li></ul>
<p>There are many other examples. But the four given are of the same nature as the others.</p>
<p>The results of <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite> disclosures have been  &mdash;  depending on who you are  &mdash;  catastrophic or highly entertaining. Promising careers have been blighted. Distinguished careers  &mdash;  that is, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> &#147;distinguished&#148; </b>within the rules of the political game  &mdash;  have been cut short in corruption scandals that will forever put all else in the shade. So far, about a dozen Members of the House of Commons have announced that they will not stand again at the next election, or have been blocked by their parties from standing again. The Home Secretary has resigned from the Government. The Communities Secretary has resigned. It is possible that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be sacked within the next few days. Other Ministers will probably leave the Government. The Speaker of the House of Commons has been forced to resign. Dozens  &mdash;  perhaps hundreds  &mdash;  of Members are expected to lose their seats at the next election, as an angry electorate delivers its own verdict on the general scandal.</p>
<p><b>The Real Causes of Disenchantment</b></p>
<p>Now, the expenses scandal may have been the immediate cause of current electoral upsets. But no one who is honest or can think longer than four minutes at a time will regard it as anything approaching the ultimate cause. The British people are outraged  &mdash;  that much is certain. The stories published have shown a grossness of behaviour we used to think confined to the political classes of lesser foreign countries. On the other hand, the total cost of the illegitimate claims  &mdash;  even including those merely questionable  &mdash;  does not amount to more than a few million pounds. Since 1997, our Labour Government has burned its way through two <em>trillion</em> pounds of our tax money. This has been mostly used to buy Labour votes or to oppress us  &mdash;  usually both. During this time, the Government has put an ancient and highly successful Constitution through the shredder. It has abolished common law protections of liberty, and replaced them with the powers and institutions a police state. It has limited its own political accountability by alienating national sovereignty to the European Union. It has engaged us in wars of imperial aggression against <a href="https://www.seangabb.co.uk/freelife/flhtm/fl31clar.htm"> Serbia,</a> <a href="https://www.seangabb.co.uk/freelife/flhtm/fl39war1.htm"> Afghanistan</a> and  Iraq..</p>
<p>It has also encouraged legal immigration on an unprecedented scale, and done nothing about a possibly greater illegal immigration. According to official figures, the <a href="https://www.olimu.com/WebJournalism/Texts/Commentary/UKRaceRiots.htm">non-white population</a> of the  United Kingdom is about five per cent. The probable figure may be as high as 20 per cent. <a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4058740,00.html">The Government statisticians themselves admit that the figure may pass 50 per cent as early as 2040.</a> This immigration has been facilitated by positive discrimination and hate crime laws that give preferential treatment to the newcomers and suppress complaints. If it has raised gross domestic product, and if it may have raised the living standards of the middle classes, the immigration has noticeably reduced the living standards of the working classes. And it has raised obvious questions about the survival of at least the English people and their liberal institutions.</p>
<p>We have put up with all of this and more. The Labour Government has won two further elections since 1997. There have been no riots. There has been no irresistible rise of new political forces. Now, if the whole political establishment appears on the brink of public rejection, we are supposed to think is because a few dozen Members of Parliament have been fiddling their expenses.</p>
<p>The reason for this, I suspect, is that the expenses scandal has been seized on by the people as the surrogate for the far greater complaints already mentioned. These cannot easily be made in public. Some cannot be made because it would be illegal to make them  &mdash;  or, if not illegal, making them would be attended by informal sanctions. Most cannot be made because it is almost impossible to breakthrough the wall of lies behind which our rulers have sheltered themselves.</p>
<p>For  years now  &mdash;  and the Conservatives were nearly as bad in this respect  &mdash;  British Governments have been refusing to tell the truth about their actions or intentions. Every lunatic or evil change has been accompanied by the flow of unpersuasive but unanswerable chatter most of us can remember from childhood.</p>
<p>To take one example of this, there is the <a href="https://libertarianalliance.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/sean-gabb-and-gordon-brown-debate-the-eu-constitution/">European Constitution.</a> Back in 2005, the European Union decided to sweep away the tangle of treaties and lesser agreements under which it operated and replace them with a single constitution. This was an impenetrable document, but appeared to bring about the final transfer of sovereignty from the Member States to the European Union. It was rejected by the French and Dutch in referenda. It was then withdrawn. In Britain, the three main parties solemnly promised before the general election of that year that they would not sign up to a revived constitution until after the British people had been consulted in a referendum.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Constitution was edited into the Treaty of Lisbon. This appears to achieve exactly the same as the Constitution by amending earlier treaties. It is shorter than the Constitution, (which runs over 400 pages [<a href="/upload/readerfriendlybook.pdf">PDF</a>]) but also still more opaque. This was rammed through Parliament by the British Government, with support from the Liberal Democrats. The justification was that the election promises had governed the Constitution, not another treaty. Every Government Minister and every Liberal Democrat leader joined in the fraud  &mdash;  and did so with arguments that could only be countered by a closer reading and understanding of the relevant documents than any normal person could reasonably be expected to make.</p>
<p>And the Conservative opposition has been little better. For electoral reasons, it made a great show of insisting on the promised referendum. It then promised to hold a referendum if it won the next election. This promise, however, seems to have been limited to a referendum <em">if</em>, after the next election, the Treaty has not come into effect following ratification by all the Member States of the European Union. When asked what they would do if the Treaty had already come into effect, the Conservative leaders have refused to give a straight answer.</p>
<p>A decent construction can be put on this refusal to make the further promise. But decent constructions can no longer be credibly made of any promise made by any of the main British parties.</p>
<p>We could not shake these people on their smug, emollient drivel about the European Union or mass-immigration, or handing out unimaginable amounts of our money to privileged banking interests. But we can take hold of them and rub their noses in the dirt of their expenses claims. Those are things anyone can understand  &mdash;  and that no one can credibly defend. </p>
<p>We are like the child who has been lectured into silence over having his dog put to sleep and his best friend excluded from the house and his pockets searched every night  &mdash;  but whose parents have now broken a clear promise to watch him play in the school pantomime. We are angry, and what would otherwise be the pettiness of what has made us angry is no longer important.</p>
<p><b>What Will Happen Next?</b></p>
<p>A further question is what will come out of all this. Labour has done badly, and its days in government may be numbered. The Conservatives will almost certainly win the next general election, and the only reasonable question asked is how big will be their majority.</p>
<p>But none of this may be very important. The Conservatives are part of the political cartel that rules my country. They cannot be worse than Labour. But they will almost certainly be little better. They may take enough of the hard choices to stop the country from disintegrating in the short term. But the longer term problems will not be addressed.</p>
<p>What we have at the moment, therefore, is not a revolution  &mdash;  as some of the newspapers have claimed  &mdash;  but a peasants&rsquo; revolt. We have grievances. But we lack the organised articulating body for those grievances that will bring about meaningful change.</p>
<p>This may, though, be one of the precursors of revolution. It may be our equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affair_of_the_Diamond_Necklace">Diamond Necklace Scandal</a> in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ancien regime</i> France. That did not bring on the Great Revolution. But it did prepare the way by showing the greed and stupidity of the people who ruled France.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped  &mdash;  though not necessarily expected  &mdash;  that the longer term result of what has just happened will be to enable the emergence of new political forces in the United Kingdom  &mdash;  or perhaps just in England. I do not think these have yet made an appearance. I voted for the United Kingdom Independence Party. But this is a protest party. It has neither the personnel nor the ideology for mounting a challenge capable of overturning the established order of things. </p>
<p>Several people I know voted for the British National Party, and are rejoicing in its successes. This party has the best leader any nationalist party in  England has had since the Establishment itself stopped being recognisably pro-British. He is clever. He is articulate. He is brave. He and his party, nevertheless, are tainted by their national socialist past. Too many of the party&rsquo;s leading members have said or done things that most people in this country regard as disreputable.</p>
<p>Whatever successes it may now be celebrating, I do not think the British National Party has much of a future. Or, if it does have a future, this must be under a new and untainted leadership.</p>
<p>However, just because I cannot see where it will lead, I can take pleasure in watching the modern equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants'_Revolt">Peasants&rsquo; Revolt,</a> and hope that it will ultimately lead us out of the gutter into which our political class has dumped the British people.</p>

		<p>I keep hearing that votes for the BNP were merely protest votes.  The left wing and the media truck this excuse all the time every time a right winger does well, they used it all the time when Pat Buchanan won primaries and caucuses in 1992 and 1996.  </p>
<p>The trouble is this:  Why are only BNP votes anti-Labor protest votes?  Why aren&rsquo;t Tory votes protest votes?  Are UKIP votes protest votes?  Heck, the GREEN PARTY doubled its share from four years ago.  If any votes are protest votes, they are those extra GP votes; white left-wing voters probably figured the Labor Party as hopeless, and were &#8220;freed up&#8221; to vote their conscience.</p>

		<p>The writer is a coward who can&rsquo;t bring himself to actually support the only serious political party frighting to save his country because some people in it were not politically correct enough in the past.  This is exhibit A about why Anglo-Saxon countries are self-destructing.  What&rsquo;s more important, saving your country or keeping away from &#8220;disreputable&#8221; people?  This obsession with status and this unmanly cowardice must go if we are to save our societies from destruction.  </p>

<p>This was an interesting and very powerful article!</p>
<p>I particularly enjoyed the reviews of the &ldquo;Expenses Scandal,&rdquo; and the general problems of the &ldquo;Treaty of Lisbon.&rdquo; and the &ldquo;solemn&rdquo; Tory perfidy in relation to it. Very entertaining and enlightening indeed; it certainly opened my eyes to a number of problems in the UK&rsquo;s body politic, that I have been only somewhat informed about at best.</p>
<p>However, a secondary question was raised in my mind regarding this article, when I decided to quote the above paragraph from it. This being that since the BNP reflects most accurately what many American participants in the AR forum would like to see develop in a political movement (or party) here in the USA, what  should be our most important and unifying baseline in these regards? </p>
<p>I would hold, that it is putting a full end to (i.e., utterly eradicating) multiculturalism in the USA. Immigration, white majority dispossession, affirmative action, genocide through miscegenation, and just about every other problem we face as a race on this continent, can be traced back to this hellishly wretched state religion of the federal government and the secondary units of government found in the states, and lesser entities in this country. </p>
<p>Just something to think about,</p>
<p>John PM!!!</p>

Quoth John PM wrote at 8:05 PM on June 12:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; [W]hat should be our most important and unifying baseline in these regards?&#8221; </p>
<p>In America, we must, must, must! break the omnipotent federal control over all other governments and the people themselves.  This must be the first priority and by a large margin.  Why?  Because the &#8220;right&#8221; has many conflicting, competing agendi and they can best be accommodated by the original configuration of sovereign states in a federation, rather than a national central government of homogeneity and dictatorial power.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must strive to reduce non-white immigration (and reduce the numbers of peasant white Sheople) just as the BNP claims, although we do not have as strong a case as with Briton (40,000 years&rsquo; inhabitation makes a good argument).</p>
<p>Until these two are done, nothing else will matter: we lose.</p>

<b>&#8220;The idea that people might have voted as they did because they liked what they saw cannot be entertained.&#8221;  </b><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
I have witnessed this sort of  thing in Europe! I have encountered it personally.  Most Europeans, especially young ones, have been very conditioned to think and to see the world only in a certain way, a very doctrinaire socialistic way.  (Of course, those virtuous socialists haughtily think that WE Americans are the backward ones because we don&rsquo;t see everything the same as they do!)   On ideological  issues, it strikes me that they&rsquo;re not too very different from devout Moslems who have never been exposed to the &#8220;corrupting&#8221; influence of any alternate ideas.   When confronted with any &#8220;cognitive dissonance&#8221;, they pull on their mental blinders and REFUSE to see what they don&rsquo;t WANT to see.   And if you have any opinion that differs from theirs, they REFUSE to hear what they don&rsquo;t WANT to hear.  Horrors! You might offend their ears with some blasphemy.  Infidels don&rsquo;t have any opinions worth hearing anyway.  The degree of ideological rigidity, closed mindedness,  and  wilful blindness  on certain controversial issues (such as race)  is astounding.  </p>
<p>Of course, to them, there is no controversy at all about  what we call &#8220;controversial&#8221; issues. There is only ONE right way of thinking and that&rsquo;s that.  Anything else is just plain crazy.  And not merely crazy   &mdash;    but forbidden, banned  and downright  illegal!  Saying the wrong thing, or having the wrong opinion on the wrong subject, can land you in a prison cell.    In America you may be scorned for unpopular or unconventional ideas, but Europe you&rsquo;ll be imprisoned for them.   </p>
<p>I have often thought that the age of  the religious wars is  not  behind us.   Not at all.  The 20th century was marked by massive conflicts over warring ideologies, even more widespread and vicious than anything in the terrible 1600&rsquo;s.  Marxism and Political Correctness have become the new  State Religion, the Established Church, of most of the countries today;  and  the wars of religion, persecutions, and inquisitions  have just shifted from  theology to ideology.    Nothing new!  Your former Grand Inquisitors are  now  working as Race Relations Commissioners.</p>
<p>Enforcement of orthodoxy and hatred of heretics have not changed a bit. We just saw a glimpse of that this past weekend. <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>PS. The article was interesting at first, but as it went on it got progressively pessimistic and ended on a very sour note which I didn&rsquo;t care for at all.  </p>
<p>As another poster remarked, this squeamish writer is afraid to save his country because some people were not sufficiently  Politically Correct and he doesn&rsquo;t want to get &#8220;tainted&#8221; by them.   Well,  well.    Pathetic!   Ring up Heaven and ask them to send  down a few saints. The present leadership  of the BNP is  less than perfect. </p>

		<p>Joe of post #4, I don&rsquo;t believe that claiming 40,000 years as inhabitants of this Continent is necessary to claim that Whites are the rightful Aires of this Republic. </p>
<p>We Whites laid the Cornerstones for the building of a great new Society based on a man&rsquo;s Individual Freedom to choose what is best for him, and his family.</p>
<p>This System of Government had never been tried before in non-White Countries. Even today, many non-White Nations are in constant political,  and Social turmoil. </p>
<p>I also think that&rsquo;s why roughly 35 States in the Union have declared their Sovereignty, through the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution, a Founding Document that we have not seen fit to use in awhile, which is a revolt to the ever increasing Federal intrusion into our lives.</p>

		<p>i Several people I know voted for the British National Party, and are rejoicing in its successes. This party has the best leader any nationalist party in England has had since the Establishment itself stopped being recognisably pro-British. He is clever. He is articulate. He is brave. He and his party, nevertheless, are tainted by their national socialist past. Too many of the party&rsquo;s leading members have said or done things that most people in this country regard as disreputable.</p>
<p>i Whatever successes it may now be celebrating, I do not think the British National Party has much of a future. Or, if it does have a future, this must be under a new and untainted leadership.</p>
<p>Even if a new &#8216;untainted&rsquo; party emerges, and there is no sign of it at present, it will be treated by the mainstream media as if it were nazi. We all know how Enoch Powell was and is reviled, and there was nothing fascist about him.</p>
<p>If there are still fascist elements within the BNP. their influence is being diluted by the recruitment of new members who are not fascists. </p>
<p>For white nationalists in the UK, the choice is between the BNP and rolling over and giving up.  </p>

		<p>I agree that the BNP can only get so far. They are too tainted in the publics&rsquo; eyes and too working class to ever generate sufficient support in an overwhelmingly middle class nation. I think we will need a new party to unite the New Right and perhaps we can look to our sister nation, the Netherlands, for inspiration with their success with the newly formed Freedom Party, we just need a charismatic leader like Pim Fortuyn, easier said than done though.<br>
The BNP have been pioneers but I don&rsquo;t think they can get us over the line.</p>

		<p>&#8221;So far as I can tell from England, the American media gives little real coverage to events in the United Kingdom&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8221;We are all Europeans&#8221; claim the pro-EU elite. Except when there&rsquo;s Euro elections on and nationalist parties are riding high in the polls like at present. Their MSM gave it very little coverage in the UK, nor was there any publicity from the EU who are normally keen to waste millions on pro-EU brainwashing. Also there was hardly any TV coverage of the political mood in other EU countries either. Britons did not know what Danes, Italians &amp; Spaniards thought of the EU &amp; vice-versa. </p>
<p>Democracy is dangerous to these EU neo-Marxists who talk about living in the post-democratic era. In the last week or so leading up to the Euro elections, when it was painfully obvious to all, that because of the MPs expenses scandal &amp; other things, support for the UK New Labour government had fallen through the floor to about 16%. Only then in a blind panic did the media breathe life into a dying UKIP who had been polling only 3% in every opinion poll, in a desperate attempt to prevent the BNP, the genuine anti-EU nationalist party, who for more than a year had actually been receiving 20-30% of the vote in local elections, from winning more seats than the two they did. By placing the UKIP front party leader Nigel Farage on every political show on television and as always demonising the BNP the few times they did mention them, the media played a huge part in UKIP&rsquo;s success. UKIP have had 7 MEP&rsquo;s for years and have achieved nothing for a party that is supposed to be seeking to withdraw the UK from the EU superstate. I believe the EU are desperate to keep the pro-EU New Labour government in place until they arrange to cajole Ireland into having a second referendum passed &amp; sign the Lisbon Treaty, leading to further EU integration</p>
<p>And as for the writer&rsquo;s allegations that the BNP leadership is tainted, I watched a video of the attack on Nick Griffin outside Westminster and then read the newspaper reports which turned the victims into the attackers and vice-versa. So much for Nick Griffin being tainted. We are living in an Orwellian world which the writer of this article seems to be happy to go along with. He is no friend of nationalists.</p>

		<p>The only thing that&rsquo;s bothering me about this article is the writer&rsquo;s classification of the military effort of Afghanistan, in contrast to Serbia and Iraq, as imperial adventurism.  </p>
<p>I think we had a perfectly good reason to be in Afg., but I will agree that the effort has been horrible.  No white country has ever successfully occupied Afghanistan.  Not England.  Part of the reason why the Soviet Union went bankrupt and dissolved was Afg.  The only reason why US/UK effort in Afg. doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a bigger quagmire is because most of our attention has been in Iraq.  If we &#8220;re-deploy&#8221; to Afg., then it will become a quagmire.</p>
<p>What we should have done is thump the Taliban, installed a Karzai/Massoud type as benevolent dictator, then gotten out.</p>
<p>For the record, I&rsquo;m sort of a 9/11 truther, but the only thing I know for sure is that we don&rsquo;t have the whole story.  I am not comfortable, unlike some other right wingers (won&rsquo;t mention David D. by name), making broad-based conclusions and accusations, based on one&rsquo;s own cognitive dissonance.  I am comfortable in thinking that no President had any prior knowledge, not Bush, not Clinton.  And I can also dismiss out of hand using pure common sense the theories that &#8220;the Jews&#8221; knew and all got out of WTC.  Which is a total lie, many Jews died at the WTC.  And there are so many Jews in NYC, how would one call them all?  Duke is just whetting his own agenda by saying that.  And he has spent most of his time since being released from Federal prison in various anti-Semitic former USSR republics, and the Arab/Muslim Middle East; and (I think) also in Ahmadinejad-era Iran, they are only happy to hear that sort of demagoguery.  </p>
<p>If there is a &#8220;rest of the story&#8221; to be found, I think it would mainly be down at the farthest deep recesses of the black hat, black box, black ops CIA crowd.  But even that I&rsquo;m not sure about.</p>

		<p>One question bothers me:</p>
<p>Would the BNP vote have been greater if the BNP had shed more of its unsavory past and run prettier and smoother candidates?</p>
<p>By which I mean shedding forever the embarrassing anti-semitism and jackboots of the present BNP&rsquo;s predecessors, the National Socialist Movement of the 1960s and so on.</p>
<p>American readers deserve to be told that the BNP is a nationalist and anti-immigration party which - perhaps paradoxically - embraces strongly nationalist but unashamedly leftist economics; more like the Albanian Road to Socialism than anything of Goldwater.</p>
<p>It is superb news that the BNP have done so well, polling a splendid 17% in Barnsley, but I wonder whether this result is the high-water mark.</p>
<p>AmRen readers ought to go to the British National Party website and spend an hour or two there to see for themselves. Then check out &#8216;The Spectator&rsquo; - a journal of the thoughtful mainstream-Conservative parliamentaty right for &#8216;Why is the rather horrid and VERY lower-class BNP so popular&rsquo; discussion. </p>

		<p>Writers on the vdare website have discussed immigration into Britain at length.</p>
<p>Mass Third World immigration began very slowly in the late 1940s, with the S.S. Windrush bringing a full boatload of West Indians to England.</p>
<p>Under the Tories, 1951 to 1964, the pace picked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&rsquo;s a labour shortage, isn&rsquo;t there?&#8221; Duncan Sandys - then a Tory minister - replied to a Tory ranker-of-no-importance who had questioned why Britain was permitting the immigration of so many total aliens. Cheap Asian labour, which delighted the capitalist class, kept the cotton mills of Lancashire and the wool mills of Yorkshire running for perhaps two extra decades but the mills closed eventually anyway and towns like Blackburnistan remain as the hideous legacy of those years.</p>
<p>However, it is in the last ten years that we have seen a relentless flood. How many Somalis? Twenty thousand or many more?  </p>
<p>Again, check out the BNP website for the BNP point-of-view,</p>

<p>What you just said reminded me of something that is crucial.  I knew it, but I forgot to think about it when analyzing the BNP.  And which might not portend well for the BNP growing much beyond what it is now.  What I&rsquo;m about to say is going to seem alien to the American mind, but is the key to understanding the whole thing.</p>
<p>British societies, and by that, I mean the UK itself sans Northern Ireland, and also Australia, (not counting their racial minorities), are fanatically class-conscious.  There are extremely tight Berlin Wall type boundaries of persona, behavior, personality, attitudes, sociology and swagger between the various economic classes of British life.  Class mobility is extremely difficult; even if a working or middle class household wins the lottery, they rarely if ever move to the rich part of town, mainly because of the social ostracism they will face in their new neighborhoods; their staying where they are means they will remain in familiar and friendly class territory.  A rich person who loses their shirt would rather commit suicide or slum uptown than move to the middle or working class areas.</p>
<p>The BNP has typecast itself in the working class, and therefore, its glass ceiling is the numerical limits of the working class.  The UKIP came in second place, mainly because it was favored by middle class conservatives who want something more than Tory squeamishness.  Even if the establishment had not pumped up the UKIP to co-opt the BNP, the BNP would have still gotten just about the same number of votes that it did.  Without the UKIP,  those that voted for it probably would have settled for Tory, or stayed home.  </p>
<p>The vitriol and hate directed toward the BNP from all the major political parties, Tory, Labor and LibDem, is just as much, if not more so, class contempt and jealousy and bigotry towards the white working class from the middle class and upper class, as it is political disagreement.</p>
<p>The only way out for the BNP is if it makes some sort of deal and patches things up with the UKIP, a joint party would be able to appeal to the voter-rich British middle class.  But I don&rsquo;t think that can happen, mainly because of the contempt that the middle class and working class have toward each other.  Asking the Brits to overcome their classism would be like canceling a whole soccer season, but if they don&rsquo;t, England is done for.  </p>

<p>There is no need to be in Afghanistan&hellip;. if the goal is to prevent another terrorist attack on American soil. All that has to be done to protect Americans from another terrorist attack is 1)0 LEGAL IMMIGRATION 2)0 illegal immigration and 3)deportation of all muslims in America. This makes much more than sense than invading the world and inviting the world-and in the process reducing Native Born White Ameicans to an ever dwidling racial minority withun the borders of America&hellip;at the hands of millions of muslim &#8220;Americans&#8221;. </p>
<p>If a military draft of Native Born White youth was implemented to fight the war on terror-whatever this means-in Afghanistan,Native Born White Americans-especially the parents of Native Born White MALE teenagers- would choose 0 LEGAL IMMIGRATION and deportation of muslims. I state this with 100 percent certainty.</p>

<p>This is what I&rsquo;ve been saying all along. A better defense is a good offense. We need to protect our own country instead of spending billions getting bogged down in Afghanistan and having our soldiers maimed and killed. How much better would it be to simply stop all muslim immigration, deport all muslims who are not citizens and use undercover operations to root out terrorist cells or jihad movements here in the USA. Infiltrate mosques or muslim schools, any talk of &#8220;jihad&#8221; and the mosque/school/group is shut down and those and their families deported. Also, seal the Mexican border. Stop allowing most muslims to visit the USA and the small amount allowed to visit(only those with relatives here, those here on business) should be given strict scrutiny. Then the risk of terrorist attacks would be reduced to very, very little and it would cost a whole lot less, be a lot easier and nobody would get killed.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Thanks so much!  I found your comments extremely interesting.   (Btw, I&rsquo;m  unclear if you meant to include or exclude Australia in that grouping.)   </p>
<p>Yes, for Americans, these subtle, unspoken distinctions are difficult to understand (or even recognize), and they often slip past unnoticed.   I can also sense, as an American,  that the British are a little baffled by us, as they can&rsquo;t quite figure out where to place us in their  mental pecking order.  We don&rsquo;t quite fit.  (Please do, by all means, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong!)  Evidently, it&rsquo;s very important to them that they fit everyone into a rigid class frame, and they&rsquo;re flummoxed if they can&rsquo;t.   Meanwhile,  Americans don&rsquo;t even realize that they&rsquo;re trying to figure us out   &mdash;   class wise, I mean.  They&rsquo;re probing and prodding with laden questions,  but we generally don&rsquo;t notice it.  It&rsquo;s their obsession, but it isn&rsquo;t ours!   </p>
<p>In the meantime, they  (and all Europeans)  are careful to let us know, in a condescending way,  that they have no  silly hang-ups about nonsense  like race   &mdash;   but they don&rsquo;t  even recognize their own about class!</p>
<p>This class obsession is the same all over Europe, not limited to Britain alone.  I read a fascinating article about this somewhere,  a while back.    It said the Dutch, just  like the British,  can tell  precisely who is who,  class wise,  by their speech, the moment they open their  mouth.   </p>
<p>It pointed out that even in Sweden, despite the enormous inroads made by socialism, class snobbery  remains very much alive.  In Sweden, people are still socially graded and addressed by their occupation, such as Mr. Postmaster or Mr. Schoolteacher.   And furthermore, their wives share their social position, being addressed as  Mrs. Postmaster, etc.    Thus, they know exactly who is who, and where they fit.  Socialism, with all its zeal for reform,  apparently hasn&rsquo;t made a bit of difference in this regard.   </p>
<p>I had a friend, some years ago, who went to Germany as a grad student.  As part of the program, he was employed for a brief time at an automobile plant in the Saar.  He was assigned to the privileged class, and he mentioned  that the place was just as rigidly divided between executives and workers as it would have been, in another era, between  aristocrats and peasants.  Separate dining rooms, separate everything.  One class didn&rsquo;t mix with the other.</p>
<p>I love Europe.   BUT&hellip; this class snobbery is, just like the ideological intolerance and the  lack of free speech,  among the reasons why   &mdash;   interesting as Europe is to visit   &mdash;   I would not want to live there permanently.   One can only stand it for so long.  Coming back to the USA, where you can speak your mind  freely without fear of going to prison or being sued for every cent you have over the utterance of one forbidden word, is a breath of fresh air.  God bless America!   </p>

Quite true. But the rich and powerful (and their lackey politicians)  neglected to consider what  <i>&#8220;some of their people&#8221; </i> can   mean, especially  when you&rsquo;re dealing with countries that have hundreds of millions.  Or even,  as in the case of India, a billion.  </p>
<p>To a country such as India,  &#8220;some&#8221; people&#8221; being taken in as immigrants  could easily mean a hundred million, which would utterly flood Britain or any other European country, while India would hardly even notice the loss  (and would have made it up in the meantime).</p>

		<p>Question Diversity: Your analysis is simplistic and seems to be based on American impressions of Britain from the 1950s.</p>
<p>Social mobility in the UK has indeed reduced but this is largely the result of regressive changes to the education system made by the present Labour government; the abolition of most of our excellent grammar schools being a case in point. Furthermore, the suggestion that classes never mix in the same neighbourhood shows no awareness of the changes to, for example, the East End of London since the 1950. Sure, we still have middle class areas and working class areas - as does the US.</p>
<p>Lastly, the BNP has also been increasing its share of the vote in the south of England. This may not have been reported in the US because our &#8216;first past the post&rsquo; electoral system means that it has not resulted in additional seats.<br>

<p>Piggybacking on what you said, a few days after the MEP elections, the DAILY MAIL newspaper had a story that &#8220;white working class boys&#8221; (exact quote) were at the bottom of the educational heap in England.  Black Caribbeans did better than them.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon, black Caribs better than whites?  As Nell Carter might have said, &#8220;Gimme a Break!!!&#8221;  My theory is that whites are being given the finger by everyone in England that matters.  They don&rsquo;t have a horse in the race, so why bother going to the track?</p>
<p>Then BNPvoter reminded me of the fanatical class consciousness.  I finally figured out the scam of it.  The DAILY MAIL = Tory Party = Middle-Class.  This article with this headline was not written out of sympathy, it was written out of scorn and derision.

<p>This probably also explains why the British upper classes are even bigger diversity fanatics than the American elites.

<p>I hope you are wrong, but fear you are not.  If this is true, than the country will capsize, and soon.  Do not the upper classes recognize that the class system is not respected - or to put it better, recognized - by the immigrants?  They will be after their children next.<br>

<p>Yes, now that it&rsquo;s been pointed out, I can see that the title is dripping with snobbish contempt.</p>
<p>(Those ignorant peasants! How stupid they are!  Look what they&rsquo;ve done now&hellip; voting for trash like the BNP.   They shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to vote at all, the fools!  They ought to leave those things to those like us who know better what&rsquo;s good for them.)<br>

		<p>I really have to dispute this caricature (for that is what it is), that the BNP is a solidly working-class party appealing only to Whites at the bottom of Britain&rsquo;s social heap.<br>
  The fact is that the BNP gets it biggest support in areas whicha are *directly impacted by massive immigration* (which calls to mind the many sociological truisms highlighted by Amren over the years in scholarly reports of the issues eg Puttnam).It just so happens that areas worst afflicted by massive immigration happen to be areas traditionally inhabited by the &#8216;English working class&rsquo; (England is a geographically small country, where traditionally, strong ties of loyalty bound people to particular neighborhoods).<br>
   I can assure everyone here that there is a massive wellspring of unspken (for obvious reasons) support for the BNP amongst English people of the higher social echelons.</p>

		<p> &#8220;I think we will need a new party to unite the New Right and perhaps we can look to our sister nation, the Netherlands, for inspiration with their success with the newly formed Freedom Party, we just need a charismatic leader like Pim Fortuyn, easier said than done though.&#8221; BNP voter</p>
<p>   The problem with having a charismatic leader, like the late Pim Fortuyn, is when they are assassinated or discredited; the party is left in a shambles. While I admire Nick Griffin, he carries too much political baggage to be an effective long term leader for the BNP. He needs to work behind the scenes out of the public eye. The BNP needs a wider collective leadership with a real appeal to younger voters. It&rsquo;s too easy for the controlled media to discredit one leader like the late Georg Haider.</p>

<p>And if one does not come along, we just submit to our fate? </p>
<p>Time is not on our side. As I see it, the BNP has thrown the British people a lifeline. The choice is between seizing it  or going under. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I have witnessed this sort of thing in Europe! I have encountered it personally. Most Europeans, especially young ones, have been very conditioned to think and to see the world only in a certain way, a very doctrinaire socialistic way. <br>

<p>Uh, yeah.  Same as EVERY OTHER NATION OR CONTINENT since communism won, starting in the 1990&rsquo;s.  Marx et al&rsquo;s stupid anti-elite notions are the only acceptable thought/speak in our world.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Baby, you&rsquo;re SO High Class!&#8221;</p>
<p>I am hesitant to go OFF-TOPIC, but the social class issue in the UK/USA has been mentioned.</p>
<p>In The USA things are better concealed from the ordinary folks - the people whom Machiavelli called the vulgo - but the reality could be glimpsed momentarily when two members of the Yale Skull and Bones contended for the Presidency. Statistically they are far rarer than Etonians are in the UK.</p>
<p>Accents aren&rsquo;t so obvious, of course.  Nonetheless, the life chances of a kid from Andover are - statistically - far better than those from from - say - the high school Lynndie England attended. </p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s an interesting paradox that the three richest self-made billionaires in the USA are two university dropouts and a graduate of the University of Nebraska.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an oldie now, but Paul Fussell&rsquo;s &#8216;Class in the USA&rsquo; is worth reading, as is the still older &#8216;Class&rsquo; by Jilly Cooper, a British writer. </p>
<p>In an interview, Jilly Cooper related how a voluble American at a publisher&rsquo;s party in New York spent ten minutes telling her loudly how the USA had no class system &#8220;like you do in England&#8221; before leaning over and disclosing that he came from a &#8220;socially prominent Baltimore family.&#8221;</p>
<p>But would he have as readily disclosed that he was from a socially prominent Newark family, I wonder.</p>

<p>You very close to what has to be done. The BNP has to be way bigger than Nick Griffin. It has to be a grassroots-Native English-networked acrosse England-strong accountability political structures built in to weed out megalmaniacs in it for personal glory. </p>
<p>Also. I do not buy into the view is a liability because of &#8220;excess political baggage&#8221;. As long as Nick Griffin isa servant of the Native English and is politically and morally uncorruptable he will do fine.</p>
<p>From here on out Native Enflish and ordinary Native Born White Americans have to be highly vigilent. Civic life must be social life. Turn off ESPN!!!</p>
