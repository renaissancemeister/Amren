			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hector Tobar, Los Angeles Times, June 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been invited by USC to be on a panel discussing the topic of blacks and Latinos in Los Angeles literature. But the mostly student audience didn&rsquo;t want a writerly chat. They wanted to talk about the reality of a divided, angry city.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s certain parts of Watts and Compton where blacks can&rsquo;t go,&#8221; a young black man told us, rising up from his seat to describe Latino gang members&rsquo; slurs and threats.</p>
<p>A high school teacher rose to his feet, too, to talk about his Latino students&rsquo; ignorance of African American history and the intolerance he often hears from the Spanish-speaking immigrants around him.</p>
<p>It hurts me deeply to hear of these things. {snip}</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a few idiots with spray paint, and hate in their hearts, ran an African American family out of a predominantly Latino neighborhood in Duarte. It was the latest in a series of incidents in which suspected Latino gang members have committed crimes against black people.</p>
<p>These acts of intolerance are obviously the work of a tiny minority of delinquents. And yet they feed a larger malaise among African Americans. A lot of black people feel they&rsquo;re being crowded out and disrespected by the growing plurality of Latinos around them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More often than we care to admit, our people segregate themselves from blacks in schools and churches.</p>
<p>And how many of us Latinos have been at family gatherings and heard some obnoxious old uncle drop a racist remark? {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Listen up, <i>raza.</i> We&rsquo;re walking in the footsteps of giants. Black people have bled and been beaten in the name of equality, and without their sacrifice, we&rsquo;d be 30 years behind where we are today.</p>
<p>The long African American struggle for civil rights has blossomed into an oak tree of justice whose large canopy protects all of us, no matter our color. And these days there are more of us Latinos huddled under its branches, seeking shelter from discrimination, than any other group.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the basic fact of our citizenship. Like thousands of others Angelenos, I am the son of immigrants. I thus owe my citizenship to Dred Scott, a slave who sued for his freedom in 1857, and to people like Frederick Douglass, who took up his cause.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After the Civil War, the black struggle to erase <cite>Scott vs. Sandford</cite> from American jurisprudence led to the passage of the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to those born in the United States. But these days, the children of Mexicans and Central Americans are its chief beneficiary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Latino and have had the pleasure of voting for someone with a Spanish surname, if you live in an integrated neighborhood, you have the dead and battered of 1960s Birmingham and Selma, Ala., to thank for it. Their martyrs are our martyrs too, because their sacrifice made the civil and voting rights we now enjoy possible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the new Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles and surrounding cities have been established in historically black communities.</p>
<p>There was no organized black resistance to the &#8220;browning&#8221; of South-Central Los Angeles or Compton. Yes there were isolated crimes against Latino people in those places, but the more common, everyday truth was that African Americans accepted the arrival of strangers into their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>I saw this firsthand in 1992, when I lived in South-Central on assignment, with my Times colleague Charisse Jones to profile a community in transition from black to brown. We met African Americans who had learned a few words of Spanish and who remembered how whites tried to keep them out of the neighborhood in the 1950s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was once in the same boat they are,&#8221; a 70-year-old black resident said of his Latino neighbors. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t mistreat them because I didn&rsquo;t want to be mistreated.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s almost a joke to me how the white man is so often portrayed as the RACIST against the poor little, helpless black folks but the fact of the matter is whites are probably the LEAST racist people on the planet. Most of the gains blacks have made are because of white initiative not in spite of it. blacks left to their own means would STAGNATE very quickly as shown by cities like Detroit and Oakland. blacks have destroyed most of the modern wonders built by whites and abandoned by whites in South Africa. Now the LATINO&rsquo;S are quite a different story. They don&rsquo;t kowtow to blacks and they put up with very little black foolishness, Whites might move but LATINO&rsquo;S DON&rsquo;T MOVE they seem to have other ways of doing things? </p>

<p>The more diversity, the more division.</p>
<p>Though many people sense it, they refuse to believe it or want to believe it can be overcome (with more diversity).</p>
<p>I certainly hope these blacks start getting their message out that it&rsquo;s not whites that are a threat to them but hispanics.</p>

		<p>This so-called hoped for Black/Hispanic alliance will never work. Unlike guilt ridden Whites who are trained to be tolerant to all races, there will be no such thing from Hispanics ie. &#8220;the raza&#8221;. They,like all other non-Whites, have no guilt at being racial, protecting and promoting their own race and culture and advancing their race at the expense of others. </p>

		<p>The &#8216;gains&rsquo; blacks have made are because of whites.  They wouldn&rsquo;t have had ANY rights had whites not granted them (voting, employment, etc)  This smells like another way to go against &#8220;whitey&#8221;</p>

		<p>Black and brown racists have killed, raped, and murdered hundreds of thousands of whites since the Civil Rights Movement.  There words are meaningless to me.  They are liars and racist liars at that.  White unity and white power is my calling under God.  I respect the mestizos for standing up to black aggression.  The mestizos are less girly than we - more stupid but less girly.  </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought for Mr. Hector Tobar when he talks about &#8220;Latino Rights&#8221;. Millions upon millions of Mexicans, for example, haven&rsquo;t the slightest right to be in this nation. They have entered it unlawfully and they have usurped the social services that Americans have paid into for years, causing hospitals, emergency rooms, food banks, and every other program the American taxpayer paid for, to go bust. It really is outrageous for these Mexican malcontents to be talking about rights. But alas, millions of Americans don&rsquo;t get it, and never will, until it is too late. Americans need to have the right to deport millions of the people Tobar is talking about. That is the only context in which we can possibly use the word &#8220;justice.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The fact is that in the main, massive mestizo imigration to the USA is a recent phenomenom, really no more than 40 years old.<br>
  Therefore trying to claim that mestizos somehow &#8216;owe&rsquo; American blacks some sort of debt of gratitude is erroneus, they came to the USA with a &#8216;clean slate&rsquo; finding the laws and customs of the USA as they took them.</p>

		<p>SoCal is not a good place to be if you are white or black. More of blacks are moving back to the South, where they can be more at home and in touch with their cultural roots and even have some space to stretch out and go fishing and enjoy life instead of stagnating in an urban ghetto (aka holding pen). </p>

		<p>The article would be funny&hellip; except for the bleak reality that neither Blacks NOR Hispanics have anything positive to offer the formerly all-White neighborhoods they&rsquo;re &#8220;integrating.&#8221; Admissible or not, crime escalates in direct proportion to the influx of minorities in a White community. A trueism that has not changed since the 1950s.</p>

<p>It hurts me deeply to think of my great-grandparents coming from Germany, leaving everything behind to start a new life, working hard, learning English so they could be a part of U.S. society, just so someday some pansy limp-wrist liberal race traitors could take it all away and hand it over to every &#8220;oppressed minority&#8221; that thinks the U.S. owes them something.</p>

<p>This would NEVER have occurred if the traitors in CON-gress and special interest groups did not cave in. And well once the laws were change to punish white people as a whole, white people soon learned if you can&rsquo;t bet em join&rsquo;em. </p>

<p>It is NOT that white people feel threatened by blacks, per say it is there anti-white government and anti-white laws that have threatened them into silence. i.e., job loss if one speaks the truth, massive ridicule from the Main stream media, death threats, hate crime charges for mere words, not actions, heavy fines if one chooses not to hire non-whites or do business with them, etc&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Listen up Raza, the blacks were (to our continuing regret) brought to America against their will, while most Hispanics have come to America against our will.</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment was written to grant citizenship to the American born children of black African slaves and no one else.  It does not apply to the American born children of foreign tourists, foreign students, foreign workers and it sure as hell doesn&rsquo;t apply to the American born children of illegals.<br>

		<p>Nothing new or surprising here.  Blacks are always caught and passed by every newly arriving group of any other ethnic or racial composition.</p>
<p>The largest single differene between Hispanics and other groups is that the Hispanics are willing to fight fire with fire.  Blacks know that threatening or attacking Hispanics results in swift and dire retribution, not the soul-searching and self-examination of other victims of black violence and crime.</p>

		<p>After a lifetime living and working alongside Blacks, and after a decade in Latin America I can only say that the very essence of their thinking is not merely dishonest, not even simply corrupt, but actually - sick.</p>
<p>The way they think refelcts a sickness. I would even say that bits of it, and in some cases, lots of it, are found in the language and behavior of people who share my heritage, the Irish.</p>
<p>Nietzsche identified and described this mindset better than anyone - it&rsquo;s the Slave Revolt in Morality. </p>
<p>After all these years I have come to the conclusion that the source of their dishonesty, corruption, and sickness is their mutual hatred of Reality itself. Anyone in search of a contrete example of this?  Look no further than this article.</p>
<p>The Myth of Innocence says, &#8220;I never do anything wrong.  Things are done to me.&#8221;<br>
For this belief to work it has to be automatically converted into an absolute fact, and in the act of that conversion we see their disdain for reality.  That a people, any people, should show so much contempt for Reality while demanding respect for themselves, is why I refer to them as sick.  And to sick you can add, &#8220;dangerous&#8221; as well.</p>
<p>Oh, and a Myth of Innocence (theirs) automatically implies, indeed, can not survive, without a Myth of Guilt (ours).</p>

		<p>Dedalus, #21, I like your analysis of the pyschology of many blacks in the civil rights movement and in general concering their dismissive attitudes towards reality. In fact, to expand on this idea, I believe the failure to face reality is becoming a pandemic in the United States. </p>
<p>This attitude, that someone, the government,etc.,&#8221;owes me something&#8221;, was fostered largely by the liberals. It clearly started with the democratic party and President Johnson&rsquo;s &#8220;Great Society&#8221; programs. President Nixon, however, was also to blame because he added to the philosophy of entitlement, and it has been supported by every single President since, to where it has become, incredibly, the law of the land, especially for blacks and other minorities. Now we have a society of millions of people who are not only entitled, but on recreational drugs, reality show watchers, porn freaks, &#8220;postive thinking&#8221; seminar attendies, and all of it is basically done to &#8220;get away from reality.&#8221; This is obvious because, all of these things, including the positive thinking seminars,have never worked to bring anyone back to reality.</p>
<p>To conclude, I am not trying to excuse black attitudes towards reality pointed out by Dedalus, not at all, but I am saying that I believe it isn&rsquo;t just blacks alone that are stricken with this &#8220;sick&#8221; mentality, as he rightly calls it. Perhaps a close reading of Marcus Aurelius&rsquo;s, &#8220;Meditations&#8221; would help some of these people back to reality. This would have to be preceeded by removing all entitlements. On the other hand, in the spirit of philosophy, which always takes the big picture into account,  his writings could be used by people grounded in reality, but depressed because of having to live in a society that continues to encourage the escape from reality of all those folks mentioned above. </p>
