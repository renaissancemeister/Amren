			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marilynn Marchione, AP, June 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two of the most popular and promising dietary supplements  &mdash;  vitamin D and fish oil  &mdash;  will be tested in a large, government-sponsored study to see whether either nutrient can lower a healthy person&rsquo;s risk of getting cancer, heart disease or having a stroke.</p>
<p>The study will be one of the first big nutrition experiments ever to target a specific racial group  &mdash;  blacks, who will comprise one quarter of the participants.</p>
<p>People with dark skin are unable to make much vitamin D from sunlight, and researchers think this deficiency may help explain why blacks have higher rates of cancer, stroke and heart disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;If something as simple as taking a vitamin D pill could help lower these risks and eliminate these health disparities, that would be extraordinarily exciting,&#8221; said Dr. JoAnn Manson. She and Dr. Julie Buring, of Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital in Boston, will co-lead the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we should be cautious before jumping on the bandwagon to take mega-doses of these supplements,&#8221; Manson warned. &#8220;We know from history that many of these nutrients that looked promising in observational studies didn&rsquo;t pan out.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For years, evidence has been building that many people are deficient in &#8220;the sunshine vitamin.&#8221; It is tough to get enough from dietary sources like milk and oily fish. Cancer rates are higher in many northern regions where sunlight is weak in the winter, and some studies have found that people with lower blood levels of vitamin D are more likely to develop cancer.</p>
<p>Fish oil, or omega-3 fatty acid, is widely recommended for heart health. However, studies of it so far have mostly involved people who already have heart problems or who eat a lot of fish, such as in Japan. Foods also increasingly are fortified with omega-3, so it is important to establish its safety and benefit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, getting nutrients from a pill is different than getting them from foods, and correcting a deficiency is not the same as healthy people taking large doses from a supplement.</p>
<p>The new study, which will start later this year, will enroll 20,000 people with no history of heart attacks, stroke or a major cancer  &mdash;  women 65 or older and men 60 or older. They will be randomly assigned to take vitamin D, fish oil, both nutrients or dummy pills for five years.</p>
<p>The daily dose of vitamin D will be about 2,000 international units of D-3, also known as cholecalciferol, the most active form. For fish oil, the daily dose will be about one gram  &mdash;  five to 10 times what the average American gets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The $20 million study will be sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and other federal agencies. Pharmavite LLC of Northridge, Calif., is providing the vitamin D pills, and Ocean Nutrition Canada Ltd. of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, is providing the omega-3 fish oil capsules.<br>

<p>There I fixed it and can you imagine the OUTCRY of RACISM! And screams from Al and Jesse over the deliberate genocide of black folks. <br>

<p>Gee, I thought race was just a social construct! Guess not in this case at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If something as simple as taking a vitamin D pill could help lower these risks and eliminate these health disparities, that would be extraordinarily exciting,&rdquo; </p>
<p>these health disparities? Like that is whitey&rsquo;s fault too I guess. Wait until BO Health Care arrives, than white people will really be leveled. WHite people are the minority in the world! But you would never know that by articles like these. </p>

		<p>They have to provide Vitamin D dietary supplements to blacks, as these people are not genetically suitable to live at higher latitudes. We should trust Mother Nature, not scientifically-designed means of enabling blacks to thrive in majority-white countries. The Canadian Arctic, Alaska, Finland&hellip; black people have migrated to all these areas, and there&rsquo;s now no true haven for white people to find sanctuary in&hellip; except maybe Antarctica. Any takers?</p>

		<p>Funny how leftists are so fond of promoting Nature.  They&rsquo;ll eat organic foods, support environmental causes, worship American Indians (who, they say, considered themselves part of nature)and clamor for the preservation of endangered species in their natural habitats.  Yet, when it comes to modern Humans, they are against nature.  They wish to eradicate the wonderful diversity that nature has bestowed upon us and replace it with Africans only.  Whites have no place in their version of &#8220;nature&#8221; except as old men and women passing control to blacks prior to their demise.</p>
