<h1><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/more-countries-must-help-refugees-minister-20090615-catf.html">More Countries Must Help Refugees: Minister</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yuko Narushima, Sydney Morning Herald, June 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Australia takes more than its fair share of the world&rsquo;s displaced people, and more nations need to help resettle them, says the Minister for Immigration, Chris Evans.</p>
<p>At an event marking the start of World Refugee Week yesterday, Senator Evans welcomed the significant contribution of refugees but said he hoped there would be a greater contribution from other countries.</p>
<p>&#8216;At the moment it&rsquo;s only a very small group of countries, and we need to try and ensure there&rsquo;s a broader global commitment to assisting people in need. We take a more than fair share of those seeking resettlement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Atuna Chol was forced to leave Sudan barefoot when she was nine. Carrying her two-month-old sister, she and her sick mother walked for weeks in the heat to Ethiopia before applying for asylum in the Congo. She lived in a Ugandan refugee camp before arriving in Australia in 2004.</p>
<p>A comfort she now enjoys is a restful sleep, without fear of needing to flee during the night. &#8216;If you took your clothes off, you ran naked,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;It&rsquo;s so good here. I&rsquo;m not thinking about where to run or what to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Chol, who is studying for a business certificate, teaches computer skills to young Sudanese refugees. She was among 15 students awarded scholarships yesterday in recognition of academic and community success.</p>
<p>The regional representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Richard Towle, told award recipients that education was vital.</p>
<p>&#8216;Education .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the critical building block for your own success, for your family&rsquo;s success and for your full integration and life in this country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, a report by the Refugee Council of Australia showed that refugees regularly lived in fear of arrest and deportation. Registration with the UN refugee agency often provided little protection.</p>
<p>The council&rsquo;s president, John Gibson, said: &#8216;Refugees spoke about having to work illegally to survive and fearing arrest and imprisonment because of the denial of work and residency rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The council reported exploitation of refugees who first sought asylum in countries such as Malaysia, India and Jordan.</p>
<p>&#8216;Many refugees who are in countries where they have sought protection from persecution face problems nearly as great as those experienced before they fled,&rsquo; Mr Gibson said. &#8216;The reality is far from the orderly queue imagined by some Australian commentators.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Australia, and Canada too should grant complete and unconditional asylum to whites from Zimbabwe and South Africa.They are a truly oppressed minority.They have a lot more that they can add to these nations than any others can.</p>

		<p>I notice on my to work every morning that the number of 3rd worlders is growing.  Africans in particular are appearing in ever greater numbers in more &amp; more suburbs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously government policy.Since the Labor Party came to power 18 months ago the numbers have dramatically increased.</p>
<p>They say that it&rsquo;s United Nations policy to take in these Somalis / Sudanese etc.  However I don&rsquo;t recall voting for anyone in the UN.</p>
<p>As usual the benfits paid to these people depricves more deserving Australians, particularly the aged, of more liveable benifits which they worke all their lives for.</p>
<p>Just another suck up to the UN by our ambitious PM who aspires to being the next UN secretary general.</p>

		<p>If the western countries stopped helping the third world nations they just might learn to stand on their own two feet.  Tough love.  Taking in their refugees, feeding them and giving all sorts of aid just prolongs the existence of their crooked, corrupt, incompetent governments.  In our own hemisphere Mexico&rsquo;s corrupt regime thrives because the US is it&rsquo;s over-flow drain.  As long as we take in their unwanted people and allow those same people to send money back to Mexico the Mexican elite survive.</p>

<p>WHY!! can&rsquo;t these people just STAY in one of the African countries they &#8220;walk thru the heat&#8221; through on their way to the big land of the PX, is the Congo or Uganda a short cut to Oz or the U.S. that I don&rsquo;t know about?</p>

The problem is not in white nations. The problem is in the nations of origin.</p>
<p>Remember how liberals used to say &#8216;give a man a fish and you feed him for day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for life&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Address the problem at the source and you wouldn&rsquo;t have a refuge problem.<br>

		<p>Australia&rsquo;s white population: 18 million.</p>
<p>By its count, the UNHCR says there are currently over 42 million &#8216;refugees&rsquo; in the Third World.  </p>
<p>This figure does not include the billions who are eligible to file refugee claims, based on the instabilities in their home countries.  Most &#8216;refugees&rsquo; are not processed throught he U.N. refugee systm, but only become &#8216;refugees&rsquo; when they land uninvited in a Western country.</p>

<p>Exactly. No matter how many people western countries take in, it&rsquo;s never enough and nothing ever changes. Mexico would have been forced to change a long time ago if the USA didn&rsquo;t take in all of their people. It&rsquo;s time to leave these people in their own countries.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s nice and it&rsquo;s good for her, but how does this help African countries? </p>

<p>As above&hellip;the only hope for these African countries is to eject the greedy despots and get teams of professionals to run them like corporations. Enough is enough. With all the money wasted by &#8216;Western&rsquo; countries in the post-colonial era on this hopeless continent prosperity should be already there or at least just around the corner, but no, it&rsquo;s worse than ever.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;church groups&#8221; that advocate non-white immigration to the USA do so for one reason only.  They get funding from the federal government to bring in these third world &#8220;economic refugees&#8221; although it is illegal for them to do so.<br>
I would like to see a change in the law that would make these &#8220;church groups&#8221; personally responsible for criminal acts perpatrated by their &#8220;refugees&#8221;.</p>
