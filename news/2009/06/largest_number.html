<h1>Largest Number of Africans in China Live in South of Country</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephanie Ho, Voice of America News, June 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>China&rsquo;s continuing economic boom has attracted a growing number of immigrants from around the world, who mostly come to do business. Africans are no exception. Stephanie Ho recently visited the southern commercial city of Guangzhou and reports on the African immigrants who live there.  </p>
<p>Thousands of Africans flock to the Sunday afternoon English service at Guangzhou&rsquo;s Sacred Heart Stone House cathedral. The church is packed, and wardens at the door keep stragglers from entering the overflowing sanctuary after the service has begun.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Ministry of Commerce says China surpassed France to become Africa&rsquo;s number one trading partner. Commerce between China and Africa reached nearly $107 billion last year, a historic high. Many of the estimated 20,000 Africans who now live in Guangzhou are there because of the growing business opportunities.  </p>
<p>But few want to talk to reporters. One reason may be that they themselves have dubious legal status.</p>
<p>College student Meng Jia and several of her classmates are working on a study of foreigners in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our country, we still lack a real policy for dealing with international immigrants,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So, many black people who are currently living here have an awkward situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another Guangzhou resident, Mr. Shao, has driven a taxi for six years. He says many ordinary people do not have a good impression of Africans. But he says he sees the growing number of Africans in Guangzhou as a good thing for China.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means we have more and more communication with people from all over the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If more foreigners come to China, we could feel China is doing really well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rwanda is among the growing number of African nations that have opened a trade office in Shenzhen, an economic boomtown next to Guangzhou. The office has gone from one employee to five, since it opened four years ago.</p>
<p>Rwandan Ambassador to China, Ben Rugangazi, says Rwandans in southern China bond comfortably and easily with other Africans.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the African, when he reaches Guangzhou and he&rsquo;s in a society that is very different culturally and linguistically, and he sees an African with whom he can easily communicate and he can identify himself with, you know, this is a feeling of a sense of oneness,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The Africans in Guangzhou come from all over the continent, and bring their customs and traditions along with them. People from Congo, Nigeria and Mali have the largest representation in southern China. </p>
<p>But, while Africans apparently get along well with each other, college student Meng Jia says they have little interaction with the local Chinese.</p>
<p>&#8220;They live separated from Guangzhou residents, so these two groups don&rsquo;t know much about each other,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>She says studies like hers seek to help Chinese people better understand the lives of Africans in China. This topic is taking on added urgency, as the number of African residents in southern China continues to grow.  </p>

I&rsquo;m surprised by this. I would have thought the Chinese had better sense.</p>
<p>Do they believe they can work with blacks as equals? Even keeping them segregated is a temporary solution. They WILL migrate beyond their communities with the same results we see everywhere else blacks reside.</p>
<p>Maybe Asians aren&rsquo;t as bright as we believed.<br>

<p>Obviously this guy needs a reality check. He ought to go live in New Orleans, Baltimore, Harlem, Southside Chicago for a while. Then ask him again if he thinks having large numbers of Blacks in China would be a good idea. I bet he would do a major about-face.</p>

<p>The Chinese will learn, dealing with Africans in Africa is different than dealing with them in your own yard. Expect to see the usual problems we have show up in China. Wonder if there is a ghetto lottery there or a &#8216;legacy of black slavery&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Proving once again any place that does not have a large African population is a better environment.  The most visible thing they will do is increase the crime rate. The Chinese will treat them as unwanted immigrants. Even with this status China is a better place to live than a place where people like themselves are the majority and have the power.</p>

		<p>I read the original article, and I still don&rsquo;t understand how 20,000 Africans who don&rsquo;t speak Chinese could be living &#8220;apart&#8221; from the locals, or how so many Africans could be earning a living there.  Surely China&rsquo;s cities are overrun with small businesses run by Chinese who speak Chinese.</p>
<p>And why aren&rsquo;t the Chinese authorities deporting these illegal aliens?  The Chinese do NOT have any illusions about African culture and behavior, and the government&rsquo;s plan is to REDUCE the population of China, not to allow it to increase by allowing in high-fertility immigrants.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s nothing short of incredible that the Chinese are allowing black Africans to immigrate to their country.  If ever there was a country with a sense of racial reality one would have thought it was China, only behind Japan in this regard.</p>
<p>I believe this temporary insanity will progress only so far, before Chinese authorities come to their senses and begin taking strong measures to stop black immigration and begin forcibly repatriating them to the locales from whence they came.</p>

		<p>One wonders how many Chinese women have been raped by those Africans so far.  The Chinese can also look forward to increased levels of AIDS, muggings and drug use.  Clearly the Chinese are not as smart as some consider them.  Else they would expel every last one of those Africans while they still can.</p>

		<p>Chinese college student Meng Jia is delusional if she thinks Africans and Chinese are going to start interacting with one another. Doesn&rsquo;t she realize that all the talk of &#8220;a brotherhood of men&#8221; is simple Marxist and Maoist psychobabble, lofty, windy platitudes uttered by men to get the masses under their control? Africans are in China for one reason, and ONE REASON ONLY - to lick the Chinese gravy bowl. They care NOTHING about China&rsquo;s people, culture or history - only how they can get as much money out of China, as quick as possible.</p>
<p>I hope taxi driver Shao is never robbed by these Bantus in his city - he might then not aghree that all those Bantus in China are a &#8220;good thing&#8221;. </p>

		<p>If you read the internet you will see that the chinese are indeed cracking down on the blacks.  Nigerians are especially targeted by the police often with sheer brutality.  The beauty of china is the africans have no aclu or naacp to cry and moan to.  If they are caught with expired visa the punishment is swift. They are thrown into secret jails the chinese have built and are required to pay a hefty fine something in the range of a few thousand US dollars.  Than they must also pay for the airfare ticket back to africa.  Failure to do these two things results in an indefinite stay in the jails.  The only phone call allowed are the one made to request for money to leave.  Many nigerian bloggers and forums are now pleading other nigerians not to go to china as the chinese wont tolerate the usual black riff raff.  Many arrive back to africa on wheel chairs and crutches.  In this regard the chinese have seen the same black thuggery and have responded in kind unlike the pc west.  Here is a link to show whats happening to some of the areas in china <a href="https://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china-and-its-neighbors/090219/chinas-little-africa-under-pressure" rel="nofollow">https://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china-and-its-neighbors/090219/chinas-little-africa-under-pressure</a><br>

		<p><i>Africans are in China for one reason, and ONE REASON ONLY - to lick the Chinese gravy bowl.</i></p>
<p>Most migrants, initially at least, of any race have that in mind - including Chinese migrants to Africa now, and white migrants to American in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. So blacks in this sense are not unique.</p>
<p>This is all part of globalization. </p>
<p><i>If ever there was a country with a sense of racial reality one would have thought it was China, only behind Japan in this regard.</i></p>
<p>The implication that Chinese are somehow racially &#8216;aware&rsquo; in the white racist sense is just complete balderdash.<br>
Chinese rarely talk about race at all - in fact Africans will be treated a lot better in most parts of China than in many parts of Western Europe, and definitely better than anywhere in Eastern Europe, and Russia particularly(where they, along with other non-whites, are regularly the victims of skinhead attacks).</p>
<p>The idea of bashing someone for their race, or even sexual orientation, is simply something that has never occurred to the vast majority of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>Are you an academic on the matter?</p>
<p>The vast majority of Chinese are half the size of the Bantu and could not bash them if they tried. Chinese work in other deceitful ways and will deny blacks any equal footing on all levels of society. Chinese have never been known for their racial equality.</p>

		<p>While Japan and South Korea may have some ethnic consciousness due to their historic homogeneity, China has never had that sort of unity (the Chinese, even the Han majority, are essentially a big mix of many different Asian tribes and ancient stock ethnicities). The only reason China has the appearance of racial consciousness and unity is because until recently China was so poor that racial foreigners generally didn&rsquo;t want to move there. Today, the Chinese are just as concerned with being considered &#8220;trendy&#8221;, &#8220;progressive&#8221;, and &#8220;modern&#8221;, as their white liberal western counterparts.</p>

_____________________________________</p>
<p>Interesting Mr. Liu&hellip;even more so if you are Chinese yourself.  Chinese are in fact extremely racially aware.  China imported millions of African slaves.  In order to keep their nation racially pure, they only imported males and the males were all castrated.  The rate of survival after castration was about 50%.  Now you, apparently some kind of Chinese Nationalist liberal, can try to live with the fact that your race is far more &#8220;racist&#8221; than Whites ever were.</p>

		<p>I worked in Shenzhen, and briefly spoke with an African who lived there - apparently for some time, as his spoken Chinese was pretty good. He was treated well by the Chinese. Since China is very open to global trade, most Chinese do welcome them, and they will probably even find a Chinese wife to marry. I saw a lot of Indians with Chinese wives when I lived there, and I saw a news story about an Indian who lived in China, married a Chinese woman, and spoke Chinese with his mixed-race children at home. The news story had a positive tone. </p>
<p>There was a also case where Jiang Zemin (president at that time) permitted a Chinese man to leave China with his French wife, despite his initial requests to leave being denied, and personally wished the couple well. </p>
<p>That said, I believe the Chinese do have a stronger sense of ethnic identity than American whites have. I&rsquo;ve even heard them play the race card in arguments - not in the way American blacks play it - but in this way: &#8220;well then you&rsquo;re not a true Chinese.&#8221; This usually occurs when the Chinese engages in an activity that is considered foreign. </p>
<p>My personal opinion is that for free trade, I support it, but I also believe it&rsquo;s going to have social repercussions, in the form of increased crime, greater social tension, and higher divorce rates.    </p>

		<p>China never had colonies in Africa. China never enslaved blacks. 20% of the world population is Chinese, China doesn&rsquo;t need foreign labor force. China&rsquo;s economy grew 6,1% in the first quarter despite financial crisis. China doesn&rsquo;t have liberal elite who hate their own people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask what the Africans are doing (or pretending to do?) in China&hellip;</p>
<p>But I am sure that the Chinese reaction will not be as soft as in Western Europe after a while.</p>

		<p>Mr. Liu: Of course most Chinese don&rsquo;t talk about race. The issue doesn&rsquo;t come up in most parts of the country where everyone is Chinese. But &#8220;diversity&#8221; will change things there as it does everywhere else. Twenty years ago, I recall a major anti-black riot in China. The source of the trouble was black African students pursuing Chinese women. </p>

		<p>Assuming Guangzhou is the epicentre of African immigration (as it is the economic epicentre of China), 20 000 plus a few other thousands in a country of 1.35 billion isn&rsquo;t nearly the same as a million plus blacks in a country such as Canada with only 33 million.

		<p>The Chinese have been ingratiating themselves to Africans<br>
for one reason only: African natural resouces.</p>
<p>  They (the Chinese) certainly aren&rsquo;t allowing Africans in<br>
the country to use as cheap labor. There are still millions of<br>
Chinese living in poverty and willing to work for less than<br>
any African.</p>
<p>  This begs the question: What are the Africans doing in<br>
China? Must be some sort of strategic move by the government<br>
to influence the various countries these Africans came from.</p>
<p>  The former USSR used to recruit Africans to educate them in  the superiority of their system. Then send them back to raise hell.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the Chinese will &#8220;tolerate&#8221; Africans for long.  The presence of blacks will create more racial consciousness among them.  It&rsquo;s the way the human mind works:  there is no clearly-defined self without the presence of an &#8220;other.&#8221;  (Hegel was right about that.)</p>
<p>It has come out recently that the initial rioting in Tiananmen Square was carried out by Chinese men protesting against African students hitting on Chinese women.  The pro-democracy crowd simply jumped on the bandwagon.  More events like this will happen as Chinese men begin to realize that they are competing against foreign men for a diminishing percentage of women (due to the one-child policy and favoritism toward male children).</p>
<p>Mr. Liu above must be an academic, for only academics can live so wholly in their own minds.  I have a Chinese acquaintance whose mother almost disowned him for dating a Korean woman.  The family fortune was more important to him than the girl, so he got rid of her.</p>

<p>The other way around what Mao once said – &#8220;if China spits Mongolia will drown&#8221;.</p>
<p>So it could turn into a lesson and an example about the true meaning of such immigration for a tiny fraction – it will certainly not have a perceptible impact on the people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The idea of bashing someone for their race, or even sexual orientation, is simply something that has never occurred to the vast majority of the Chinese people&hellip;&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Maybe the Chinese (or you) have forgotten the Nanjing anti-African protests of 1988-1989?</p>
<p>What William reports is true:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It has come out recently that the initial rioting in Tiananmen Square was carried out by Chinese men protesting against African students hitting on Chinese women&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are a few details:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;From December 1988 to January 1989, students in Nanjing, China waged violent protests against visiting African students&hellip;.these protests were [not] isolated events, as the Chinese government claimed.</p>
<p>Hostility and violence against visiting African students had erupted for various reasons since their arrival in 1960.</p>
<p>The Shanghai incident of July 1979 was triggered by complaints of loud music played by African students and culminated in an attack of the foreign student hall in which the African students lived. Chinese press commentaries admitted the &#8216;drunken and womanizing&rsquo; Africans were prone to troublemaking. </p>
<p>The Nanjing protests in December 1988 were triggered by a series of confrontations between African and Chinese students at Hehai University&hellip; a brawl between African and Chinese students that lasted until the next morning and resulted in the injury of eleven Chinese and two Africans. On the next day, 300 Chinese students, angered by a rumor that a Chinese man had been killed by an African student the previous evening, stormed the African students&rsquo; dormitory chanting, &#8216;Kill the Black Devils!&rsquo; The police arrived to restore order two hours later. Fearing for their safety, over 60 African students left for the railway station to reach their embassies in Beijing. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chinese students at Hehai University mobilized students from other universities in Nanjing &hellip;to demand justice for the alleged murder of a Chinese man the night before. Approximately 3,000 students marched in the streets, singing the national anthem and chanting, &#8216;Down with Black Devils!&rsquo; On December 26, the student demonstrators from Hehai University marched to the provincial government office to demand that the African students be held responsible for their crimes&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/npm3y4</p>
<p>This was a precursor to the Tiananmen Square massacre.  There were reports that 2,500 people were killed by Chinese troops and 7,000 - 10,000 people were wounded according to the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Is this the Chinese &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; you keep telling us about Mr. Liu?</p>

		<p>re:John Liu-&#8220;The implication that Chinese are somehow racially &lsquo;aware&rsquo; in the white racist sense is just complete balderdash.&#8221;</p>
<p>All races are &#8220;racially aware&#8221;, it&rsquo;s not a &#8220;white&#8221; or &#8220;racist&#8221; thing. It only becomes an issue in multiracial societies where there are different races in close contact. Chinese outside of China, say in Canada, are very racialy aware. In China, most people are the same race so race isn&rsquo;t an issue. The Chinese are naive and sheltered when it comes to living around large numbers of other races.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese rarely talk about race at all - in fact Africans will be treated a lot better in most parts of China than in many parts of Western Europe, and definitely better than anywhere in Eastern Europe, and Russia particularly(where they, along with other non-whites, are regularly the victims of skinhead attacks).&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course Chinese don&rsquo;t talk about race, most everyone in China is Chinese so again it&rsquo;s not an issue. Africans will be treated far worse in China than in any part of Europe when their numbers get large enough. Unlike  Europe, China isn&rsquo;t known for caring  about human rights, even among its&rsquo; own people, or racial equality.</p>

		<p><i>Mr. Liu above must be an academic, for only academics can live so wholly in their own minds. I have a Chinese acquaintance whose mother almost disowned him for dating a Korean woman.</i></p>
<p>I live in Hong Kong and regularly visit Guangzhou province. There are quite a few blacks in Hong Kong - most of them professionals -in fact my last two engineering jobs were found through personnel counsultants - one British Indian and one British black. Both are highly paid, and in the case of the British black he has a Chinese girlfriend.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong rarely will Chinese parents oppose the marriage of their daughter to a foreigner if he is a Westerner of any hue, although unfortunately whites are of course favored. But more tellingly, unlike the old South or parts of Eastern Europe today, Chinese would never dream of attacking other stranger Chinese for dating foreigners - Chinese are too self-contained at the familial level for that (by the way nothing to do with size - skinhead groups in Russia for instance hunt in packs).</p>
<p><i>I&rsquo;ve even heard them play the race card in arguments - not in the way American blacks play it - but in this way: &ldquo;well then you&rsquo;re not a true Chinese.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>That is similar to the way Americans talked of &#8216;unAmerican&rsquo;&hellip;or &#8216;that&rsquo;s just not American&rsquo;..etc.</p>
<p><i>It was leaked that restaurant and bar owners were given notices not to serve blacks during the Olympics.</i><br>
That was found to be a complete and utter fabrication.</p>
<p><i>The source of the trouble was black African students pursuing Chinese women. </i></p>
<p>I recall my Dad (a died-in-the-wool communist) who constantly extolled third world solidarity, telling me that the real reason was Chinese students were jealous of the better conditions that the African students lived under (courtesy of the Chinese government who handed out scholarships ala Peoples Friendship Univerity in Moscow). This of course, I conjecture, would have helped them in the dating area - ala the way British solidiers viewed Yanks stationed in Britain during WWII -&#8220;Overpaid, Oversexed, Over Here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Racial prejudice was a minor factor.</p>
<p><i>Chinese can&rsquo;t even get along with fellow Asians, never mind someone as foreign as Africans</i></p>
<p>Even Japanese and whites who plundered and raped their way across China not too long ago are treated with politeness and deference.</p>
<p><i>I imagine easily, that any type of shenanigans will be crushed by the might of the PRC army.</i></p>
<p>Any type of shenanigans by <i>anyone</i> regardless of hue and stripe is not tolerated in the PRC (unless you are one of the &#8216;princelings&rsquo; - spoilt young offspring of the leadership).</p>
<p>By the way they don&rsquo;t use the Army for this sort of thing so much now - it is the Peoples Armed Police (wujing). I visited their training grounds in Guangzhou once during an open day - talked to one chap, nice fellow, who described executions (which they also carried out up until very recently - now in fact by &#8216;judicial&rsquo; police force). He had personally pulled the trigger on a few criminals - people were curious as to whether the executioner would freak out,   &mdash;  no big deal he said in Cantonese &#8220;chut nap zhidan je&#8221;   &mdash;  &#8216;just releasing a bullet.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>The article from which the quote below was extracted describes the modern Chinese racial attitude better than any other I have ever come across.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Modern Chinese racial pride certainly exists, but it is more defensive than offensive, founded more on resentment at past wrongs  &mdash;  the Opium Wars, the Boxer Indemnity, and so on  &mdash;  than in notions of innate superiority. Since none of those historical wrongs were committed by Africans, anti-black feeling is well-nigh absent from the modern Chinese psyche. To the degree  &mdash;  and it is not in any case a very high degree  &mdash;  that Chinese people see the world as an arena of racial conflict, Africans are hors de combat.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/nl8k8u</p>
<p>Surprisingly the article is written by John Derbyshire, normally a virulent critic of China, and what he perceives to be Chinese &#8216;fascism.&rsquo;<br>

		<p><i>I saw a lot of Indians with Chinese wives when I lived there, and I saw a news story about an Indian who lived in China, married a Chinese woman, and spoke Chinese with his mixed-race children at home.</i></p>
<p>I have seen a lot of this in Hong Kong as well. As with the white-Asian gender imbalance (mostly white male with Asian female), the same goes for these Sino-Indian pairings (Indian male, Chinese female).</p>
<p>Indian families would rarely permit their daughters to outmarry - and if they are Muslims, a non-Muslim suitor could well be putting his own life at risk.</p>
<p>In fact I have a close Indian friend from university days - a Muslim. Quite a good looking chap, he bedded many white and East Asian girls. But while watching some TV news from the subcontinent at his home one day, I commented on the attractiveness of the Indian anchor (she must have been Muslim). He got quite angry with me and said something along the lines &#8216;..for brothers only&rsquo; (obviously as a non-Muslim I did not make the grade of&rsquo;brother&rsquo;). The irony of him bedding Chinese women, while denying simple appreciation by others of his own women, did not occur to him. </p>
<p>Chinese by contrast are quite lax about the very thing they should be most concerned about - the outflow of their women. But this is an indicator that Chinese are in general racially quite a tolerant bunch.</p>

With all due respect Mr. Liu I would beg to differ with your generalizations of Chinese attitudes about race.  My cousin was married to a black man,not just some working Joe by a black man studying medicine in China who was fully literate in Mandarin.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what sort of person he was and I will never find out because she was forced to break up with him as a result of family pressure.  Of course his situation did play a part, he wanted to live in China and my cousin wanted to live in the US, so obviously that wasn&rsquo;t going to work.</p>
<p>However the real tradgedy was that my aunt never recognized him as her son in law, so consequently she never really had a chance to know him and see what sort of man he truly was.  In fact no in our family ever met him.</p>
<p>My cousin told me that people in Hong Kong were racist towards blacks.  In fact she said the people in mainland China were more accepting.  Who knows perhaps that&rsquo;s just how the people in circle of friends were.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t this man was good or bad but I think he deserved a chance to show us what his true colors.  At the very least He deserved a chance to prove himself on the basis of his actions.  </p>
<p>My cousin is now getting married to a Chinese man so the race and ethnicity aren&rsquo;t issues now.  </p>

		<p>Replying to John Liu, in my experience most Chinses people are very deeply racially prejudiced - though as usual amongst Chinese they are wise enough to keep their opinions to themselves, especially when they are a small vulnerable minority themselves.<br>
 We also must consider the fact that virtually every Chinese has almost bred within them a very strong sense of the superiority not only of Chinese civilization and Chinses arts, culture and inventiveness, but of the Chinese people themselves, hence their nation is known as the &#8216;middle kingdom&rsquo; the sense being that the rest of the world revolves around China.<br>
  Contempt of other races is displayed by the Chinese - the usual target are the other Mongoloid races of tropical south-east Asia such as Malays,Phillipinos and Indonesians.They are disparaged for all sorts of reasons, but their is a genuine sense that the Chinses see them as &#8216;inferior&rsquo;.<br>
  I&rsquo;m afraid the stock attitude to black africans (despite the communist propaganda), is probably even worse.</p>

		<p>There is a prominent English Marxist by the name of Martin Jacques (he used to edit &#8216;Marxism Today&rsquo; magazine), who has transformed himself into a journalist specialising in Cjina and has written a number of books and articles on China.<br>
  Martin Jacques married a dark-skinned Indian woman, and the couple lived in China.His wife fell very ill and consequently needed to be detained in hospital, but being an &#8216;Indian Malaysian&rsquo; she could understand Chinese.She died of her illness, but shockingly she could understand every word the Chinese nurses said about her - and the comments (directed at her skin color), weren&rsquo;t very polite to say the least.</p>

		<p>John Liu&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..your ignorance doesn&rsquo;t surprise me, are you an authority to speak on behalf of all Han Chinese people?</p>
<p>You said, &#8220;Chinese would never dream of attacking other stranger Chinese for dating foreigners - Chinese are too self-contained at the familial level for that&#8221;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Well I live in Sydney where our daily media channels are filled with Sudanese, Aborigines, Muslim and many CHINESE gangs and their unlawful behaviour. Chinese are not as bad as the blacks or muslims when it comes to crime but nevertheless Chinese are still over-represented in prostitution, heroin trade, illegal migrants and yes - violent crimes against others predomonantly lone whites taking cash out of cashmachines. You sprout alot of nonsense, I&rsquo;m at the coal face and you are in HK. Go and stay in any Western City and you will become aware of the Chinese and their criminal mind.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago we had asian gangs fighting muslim gangs in the Western Suburbs, many nding up in hospital with multiple stab wounds. Chinatown is notorious for knife attacks at night with Chinese gangs roaming the streets looking for a quick fix as many are heroin addicts.</p>
<p>Reality and an opinion are two different things. Just because John Derbyshire said so doesn&rsquo;t make it truth as it is just an opinion. The doctrine of the Chinese Govt. does not allow for blacks or other foreigners to move there and claim every benefit under the sun, do they? China does not encourage multi-culturalism or immigration so what are you talking about?</p>
<p>My Mother was born in Shanghai of white Russian descent. Her parents were born in  Harbin, Manchuria. It was a difficult time in Manchuria under Jap. occupation but it was just as difficult under Chinese administration for them, they were refugees and treated like dirt. The Han Chinese are extremely racist so get off your oily soapbox.</p>
<p>By the way Ming the Merciless, the Chinese are ripping off the blacks in Africa even more than the whites did. At least the whites built Africa and the chinese are just sucking it dry. Read this little article about your Brethren and their dirty business dealings with the blacks in Africa.</p>

<p>I guess Derbyshire missed this reaction to Condolizza Rice&rsquo;s visit before the Bejing Olympics:</p>
<p>But what has not been reported in the western media is the reception Rice was given.</p>
<p>One way of taking the temperature in China is the internet, a very important indicator of public opinion in a country where more traditional media are tightly controlled. &hellip; The internet response to Rice&rsquo;s visit has been revealing. </p>
<p> Liu Xiaobo&hellip;says that of 800 messages he has read about her visit, no less than 70 involved racist comments about her colour: of these, only two were relatively moderate; the rest were vicious, describing Rice as a &#8216;black ghost&rsquo;, &#8216;black dog&rsquo;, &#8216;black woman&rsquo; and &#8216;black bitch&rsquo;. One stated, &#8216;You are not even like a black ghost, a really low form of life,&rsquo; and another, &#8216;Her brain is even more black than her skin.&rsquo; One writer said: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t support racism, but this black ghost really makes people angry, the appearance of a little black who has made good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In fact, the reaction is not that surprising. Although it is rarely written about or commented upon, Chinese culture remains deeply racist&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/n4vlyu</p>
<p>Actually, I can&rsquo;t blame the Chinese for rejecting Western-style multiculturalism, it certainly hasn&rsquo;t benefitted the US or Europe and is a huge drag on our economy.</p>
<p>Imagine wanting to keep China for the Chinese, Korea for the Koreans, Japan for the Japanese!  Those racists need to be taught a lesson by having their countries flooded, against the wishes of the populace, with uneducated, unskilled, violent, low IQd dregs of the Third World  &mdash;  all the while called every vicious name if they resist.</p>
<p>I say good for the Chinese, suspicion of and rejection of outsiders is natural, multiculturalism is the aberration.  As Jared Taylor iterates, if multiculturalism were such a good thing, people would be flocking to it and rushing toward it instead of making huge sacrifices to avoid it  &mdash;  and the government wouldn&rsquo;t have to ram it down everyone&rsquo;s throats by force.</p>

<p>Thanks for linking that article: I always thought the Tianamen Square riot was the result of thousands of Chinese students who flocked in the square to hear a speech that was to be given by Mikhail Gorbachev about how &#8220;liberalization&#8221; was changing the USSR. The Chinese authorities couldn&rsquo;t handle the overflow crowd.</p>
<p>I was aware that there were tensions between Chinese and African stuents (from Mali), after the Chinese students accused the Africans of raping Chinese women. But, I didn&rsquo;t know that these tensions would boil over at Tienamen Square.</p>
<p>Interesting how Zhou en Lai proclaimed there was no racism in China in a 1955 speech. It fits in with my earlier post about how a &#8220;brotherhood of men&#8221; is nothing more than governmental (or religious) blather. The rank and file citizens know the true score on racial awareness, regardless of WHATEVER the pols say to the contrary. </p>

<p>This shows the naive ways of people who live in societies that are of the same or mostly the same race. There is NO third world solidarity and never will be. Each race and ethnicity is out for itself. I and anyone who has been around different races knows that. Blacks are out for Black solidarity for example, not for Asian or any other race.  It&rsquo;s broken down into different ethnicities within the same race, an example is here, among Asians, the Vietnamese are for Vietnamese solidarity but not Korean, whom they view as another group and so on. Again, Mr.Liu, you don&rsquo;t live in a multiracial society, only a small amount, so you have no understanding. Also, it wasn&rsquo;t better living conditions, the Chinese were angry because the Blacks were going after Chinese women and if China becomes multiracial or gets large numbers of Blacks, it will only increase.</p>

<p>This happens anywhere with a racially diverse population, even in places which were entirely homogeneous for years before experiencing the shift in demographics. It is augmented in China by a policy of international trade which brings financial benefits while enhancing national prestige:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;If more foreigners come to China, we could feel China is doing really well.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Whatever social problems arise from the increased diversity will no doubt be overshadowed by the economic interests of the nation. </p>
