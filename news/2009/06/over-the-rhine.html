<h1>Over-the-Rhine Most Dangerous Neighborhood in U.S.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WKRC-TV (Cincinnati), June 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A website which provides crime data for insurance companies says the Over-the-Rhine area is the most dangerous neighborhood in the United States.</p>
<p>NeighborhoodScout.com says it used proprietary computer models to estimate incidences of violent crimes, including murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, armed robbery and aggravated assault, for every sub-zip code neighborhood in the U.S. The crime statistics come from local law enforcement agencies and the F.B.I. for the years 2005-2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The next four most dangerous neighborhoods, according to Neighborhoodscout.com, are found in Chicago, Miami, Jacksonville, FL, and Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
<blockquote>
<i>[Editor&rsquo;s Note: Statistics for the 100 safest and 100 most dangerous cities are available can be read <a href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/" target="stats" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a> Scroll down the page.]</i>

								<h2><a href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/">Crime Rates: Discover the Safest Neighborhoods in any City</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>NeighborhoodScout.com</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Discover the lowest crime neighborhoods in any city or town, before you buy a home or site a facility. Additionally, discover the types (violent or property) of crimes common to any particular neighborhood. Our exclusive crime data are developed for each neighborhood using our mathematical algorithms and municipal crime statistics from the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
<p>Subscribers get instant access to see where the lowest crime rate areas are located.</p>
<p><b>What our crime search provides</b></p>
<p>NeighborhoodScout reveals the safety from crime for every neighborhood in America, and shows you how each neighborhood compares to other neighborhoods nationwide, so you can make good decisions for your family or your company&rsquo;s location needs.</p>
<p>Users can search by overall crime rate, property crime rate, violent crime rate, or crimes per square mile. Users can specify any search area they need  &mdash;  by distance around a city or around a specific address (1 to 75 miles in any direction), by state, or nationwide.</p>
<p>Crime maps are complimented by detailed data. We show both the number of crimes and crime rate per 1,000 residents for violent crime, property crime, and total crime, for each neighborhood. Neighborhood crimes are compared in a graph to the overall crime rate for the city containing the neighborhood, the state crime rate, and the national median for both violent and property crime. We also provide an individual&rsquo;s chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime within any neighborhood, and show that comparison to the overall city and the state. Finally, we have calculated the crime density  &mdash;  which is the number of crimes per square mile  &mdash;  for each neighborhood, city, and state, and present this information in a table for ease of comparison.</p>
<p>The crime rates we have developed are based on data and crime statistics from the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department. We gather data from all 17,000 local law enforcement agencies in the United States, and use a relational database to associate crime incidences from all of these law enforcement agencies to the specific local communities the agency covers, and hence in which community the crimes have occurred. We then researched and developed mathematical algorithms to statistically estimate the incidences of both violent and property crimes for each neighborhood in America. {snip}</p>
<p><b>About the Crime Data</b></p>
<p>The data used from these 17,000 local law enforcement agencies are the FBI defined &#8220;crime index&#8221; crimes. Index crimes are the eight crimes the FBI combines to produce its annual crime index.</p>
<p>The index seeks to overcome differences in individual state statues  &mdash;  that would ignore how the individual is charged  &mdash;  and create a standardized definition of crime classification. This was done through defining serious and non-serious offenses. {snip}</p>
<p>These offenses include willful homicide, forcible rape, robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, larceny over $50, motor vehicle theft, and arson. In order to compare statistical information on a national basis the FBI came up with a common definition for crime comparison.</p>

		<p>The Over the Rhine neighborhood is where the riots in Cincinnati started (and took place almost exclusively) in 2001.</p>
<p>The reason why there tend to be riots in the North but not the South is that blacks are more arrogant in the north, because they&rsquo;ve been pandered to decade in and decade out, with those states&rsquo; &#8220;anti-slavery&#8221; heritages.  Meanwhile, southern blacks are only a few generations removed from the arbitrary &#8220;thump on the skull,&#8221; and are therefore somewhat more fearful of &#8220;the man.&#8221;  Mississippi never really had any riots, now you know why.  But it won&rsquo;t be long until this breaks down.</p>

		<p>Google Earth has a street view option for many cities.  If the neighborhood looks well-kept, it&rsquo;s probably safe.  If it looks like a war zone, you&rsquo;d want to stay away.</p>

		<p>I just checked the list of 100 most dangerous cities linked in the first story above. Some interesting correlations when cross-indexed with city-data&rsquo;s info. Nothing shocking to us here:</p>
<p>10	Homestead, FL  (52% hispanic)<br>
9	Bessemer, AL  (70% black)<br>
8	Atlantic City, NJ  (44% black, 25% hispanic)<br>
7	St. Louis, MO  (51% black)<br>
6	Florence, SC  (45% black)<br>
5	Las Vegas, NV  (24% hispanic, 10% black)<br>
4	University, FL  (34% black, 19% hispanic)<br>
3	Casa Grande, AZ  (40% hispanic)<br>
2	Hot Springs, AR  (17% black (&#8220;tipping point&#8221; is 15%)<br>
1	Edinburg, TX  (89% hispanic)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be interested to see the correlation of the top 10 *safest* cities with city-data&rsquo;s info. Maybe later, unless one of you beats me to it&hellip;</p>

		<p>I note that four of the most dangerous neighborhoods on the Top 25 list are in Chicago. These are 99.9 % black, although they say &#8220;mostly Black&#8221; in the links - which is false. The &#8220;East Asian&#8221; referred to in the links is Arabic, since there are a few Arab owned businesses in these neighborhoods.</p>
<p>How are any of these crime data surprising to us here at Amren?</p>

		<p>Over the Rhine (OTR)is a neighborhood that connects directly to and just north of downtown Cincinnati. It was once a a very nice white neighborhood complete with many beautiful historic buildings and churches. But after blacks started moving in it went downhill quickly. It is now an area that is unbelievable. You would literally have to experience this to believe it. OTR is a whole new world. A place that makes Detroit, East St Louis and Camden look habitable by comparison. </p>
<p>Our clueless city council doesnt seem aware that there is a crime problem there. The only time I have heard of the area mentioned is on the evening news crime report and when council tries to push their desire for a trolly system. These genius&rsquo;s actually want to run a trolly car right through downtown Cincinnati and all the way through OTR. This would have the effect of transporting countless potential crime victims directly into this cesspit. That is if anyone would dare ride it. All it will cost is $200 million. At a time when budget cuts have forced many criminals out of jails and onto our streets. </p>

		<p>Of course, the most dangerous neighborhoods happen to be black.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s not the fault of blacks either.  It&rsquo;s because their ancestors were slaves 200 years ago.</p>
<p>Hilarious. </p>
<p>Michelle Malkin interviewed one black who said black crime was George Washington&rsquo;s fault.  I thought she would split a gut laughing.</p>

		<p> The poster, Question Diversity has it right. Blacks do tend to be more arrogant and less civil in the north and might be the principal social reason behind white flight. Whites in the northeast and midwest recognize this and separate themselves demographically as a survival strategy. Strict Zoneing and high property taxes can work wonders.<br>
 Present day northern cities now function as little more than &#8220;minority containment centers&#8221; in which most of the rotton apples are kept in one basket.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The reason why there tend to be riots in the North&hellip;&#8221;    &mdash;  Question Diversity</p>
<p>Huh?  The only American riots I remember since 1970 were in Miami, Los Angeles and Cincinnati.  Hardly &#8220;the North&#8221;, wherever that may be. You must be thinking of the North&hellip; of <i>England</i>.</p>
<p>Anyway, violent crime is riot on the installment plan, and Dixie holds her own with any other part of the country on that scale.</p>
<p>If someone needs a daily &#8220;thump on the skull&#8221;, perhaps that is a sign that <i>he does not belong in your territory at all</i>?  To question diversity, Question Diversity, is to question Mississippi&rsquo;s very existence.  Whites were a minority there from the beginning until 1950, and would still be today, had secession succeeded and closed off the escape valve of Chicago  &mdash;    a city, by the way, where the last riot took place so far in the past, it was the work of white men!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think Vermont, not Mississippi, would be our ideal.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t need to do a damned computer search to know where not to go in New York City. Here are just a few areas, for those that have not had the pleasure of stopping by. Consider this a Public Service Message for Whites. </p>
<p>Harlem, Washington Heights,Hamilton Heights, Alphabet City, in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Bushwick, Brownsville, Red Hook, Flatbush, Brooklyn Heights, in Brooklyn. </p>
<p>Jamaica, Rosedale, Laurelton, Ozone Park, Richmond Hill, Rego Park, Springfied Gardens, Briarwood, Flushing, Long Island City, and Far Rockaway,in Queens. </p>
<p>All of The Bronx, except Bronxville, which has remained an old Irish Neighborhood. </p>
<p>I have not spent too much time in Staten Island, but of all the Boroghs, it is the Whitest, and has the least crime. What a coincidence. <br>

		<p>Consistently rated either no. 1 or within the top 2-3 safest towns in North America is Newton, Massachusetts, which I have known well since the 1970s (I lived &amp; worked there for several years).</p>
<p>This beautiful suburb of Boston is easily accessible by public transportation, but somehow they&rsquo;ve kept things from going downhill.</p>
<p>Newton is also heavily Jewish, is mainly middle and upper middle-class professional.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it is very expensive, so not a solution for working-class whites&hellip;..</p>

		<p>In Pittsburgh,Pa. the most dangerous areas are the hill district,Homewood,East Liberty,Beltzhoover,Homestead,Rankin,most of Penn Hills,much of Oakland,Braddock,and this is east of the city,and yes,these are mostly black areas,in the West there are Aliquippa,Ambridge,much of Crafton,Elliott,West End,Sheridan,the list will get larger,these were all fine well kept,crime free areas,until blacks moved in.<br>
As can be seen,Pittsburgh is surrounded,as for the suburbs,section 8 housing is taking care of that,anyone who says these events are not planned is dreaming,the reason?,to destroy White America,one town at a time.What do the people of Pittsburgh say about these events?,&#8221;oh,we can&rsquo;t talk about that&#8221;!</p>

<p>Even if the CSA would have beaten back the Yankee invasion, this does not mean that blacks from MS would have been able to flee to Chicagograd.  The whites there would have been glad to see them go, because they were glad to see them go between the World Wars even as MS was an American state.  Chicagograd would have gladly accepted them, even if MS wasn&rsquo;t in the same country.</p>
<p>Believe me, Mississippi&rsquo;s whites &#8220;question diversity&#8221; as much as I do.  How else do you explain 90% of whites over 30 (and 80% of whites under 30) voting against Obama?  Nothing cures the thirst like a good dose.</p>
<p>VT is full of white liberal hypocrites who mouth off about diversity, but escaped the very diversity they caused in New York City.</p>

		<p>One need only look at the Borough of The Bronx in NYC. As late as about 1960 it was still about 90% White, mostly Italian, Irish, and Jewish. You almost fall down laughing when you hear politicians explaining and making excuses for what happened in a span of about 15 to 20 years (1965 to about 1985). Never, ever, ever any mention of the change in demographic&rsquo;s. It is always blamed on neglect and some other such nonsense, but never on the people who now live there. About the only decent neighborhood in the entire Borough is Riverdale, and I doubt if you asked a thousand people from there where they lived probably not two would answer The Bronx, almost everybody would say Riverdale. Just guess what the demographic&rsquo;s of Riverdale are.</p>

<p>Gary, Indiana was the town where the play and the movie, &#8220;The Music Man,&#8221; was set. Google it, or go to youtube.com and see if you can find clips from the movie you can watch. </p>
<p>The movie stars Shirley Jones and a 6-year-old Ron Howard who went on to become the famous film director. The movie isn&rsquo;t too far off the mark in depicting what a nice town Gary, Indiana was at the turn-of-the-century. It used to be a beautiful, bucolic town out of a Thomas Kinkade painting, with many well-educated white people. Now it is a crime-ridden eyesore of dilapidated buildings.</p>

		<p>Some of these comments make me believe that some people were actually born yesterday.  For everyone&rsquo;s education, white flight was a result of black on white or brown on white ethnic and racial cleansing.  Period.  Any other explanation is nonsense and a lie.  It is our duty to right the wrongs or we&rsquo;ll forever be oppressed as we now are.  It is our duty to liberate ourselves.  I am doing my duty under God and just hope others are.</p>

		<p>I wonder how much Gary &#8220;forgets&#8221; to report certain crimes. This tends to be the case in a lot of larger cities. I&rsquo;ve not seen this around the NW Indiana, but my brother told me that in the Atlanta area, there are some unique types of home invasion burglaries. The criminals will acquire an older car (something along the line of an early 70&rsquo;s Impala). They will then cruise through the vinyl village neighborhoods where both people are working at their affirmative action jobs to pay the mortgage, the big screen tv&rsquo;s, the two SUV&rsquo;s, and all of their bling. The criminals will slip between two houses with the car, and start slamming into downstairs master bedrooms (which usually don&rsquo;t have motion detectors and are so cheaply built that there isn&rsquo;t even plywood between the drywall and the siding) and loot the valuables. </p>
<p>If you are ever driving through NW Indiana, get off the interstate at Broadway and take a look for yourself. It looks like Beirut! There aren&rsquo;t a lot of businesses there besides fast food, barber shops, and gas stations. The difference between Chicago and Gary is that Gary doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to drive state government like Chicago does for the peoples republic of Illinois. At one time, this was the second largest city in Indiana.  You drive a few miles and go into the other communities that are south of 80/94 and see that they are reasonably functioning. Unfortunately, Merrillville is turning into &#8220;Garyville&#8221;.  </p>
<p>For anyone who lived in this area when Hatcher was the mayor, can you confirm something. I heard that Hatcher rammed through a ordnance that required the city to inspect the house before you could list is for sale. I guess he was trying to stop the flood of productive people bailing out of the city; and also a shakedown. Fortunately, my in-laws left a couple of years before Hatcher&rsquo;s reign of terror. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Even if the CSA would have beaten back the Yankee invasion, this does not mean that blacks from MS would have been able to flee to Chicagograd. The whites there would have been glad to see them go, because they were glad to see them go between the World Wars even as MS was an American state. Chicagograd would have gladly accepted them, even if MS wasn&rsquo;t in the same country.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s false.  The elites in the deep south, especially MS, made a strong effort to prevent blacks from leaving north.  They even passed laws against advertising for jobs in the North.  They wanted to keep hold of their cheap labor.  Had the South won independence, it&rsquo;s unlikely that the North would have accepted millions of black immigrants, especially after WWI when the racialist movement was very strong and immigration reform was enacted.  Southerners need to drop inaccurate and sentimental views of their past if we are to move forward.  Remember Arthur Kemp&rsquo;s article about how South Africa destroyed itself through their greed for cheap labor.  The old South was much the same way.  </p>

<p>Of course the &#8220;elites&#8221; wanted them to stay, just like &#8220;elites&#8221; want open borders and amnesty, for the cheap labor.  When I talk about Mississippi, then and now, I don&rsquo;t mean the elites.  I mean the middle class.</p>
