<h1><a href="https://www.louisianaweekly.com/news.php?viewStory=1472">Blacks and Latinos Have Shared Experiences in Post-Katrina N.O.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Louisiana Weekly, June 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African Americans and Latinos living in New Orleans share remarkably similar experiences and are willing to work together to bridge differences according to a new study released last Tuesday by Oxfam America and Dr. Silas Lee &amp; Associates.</p>
<p>The new study, &#8220;Building Common Ground,&#8221; reveals vast similarities in the post-Katrina experiences of two groups often considered separately in discussions on hurricane recovery and rebuilding. While the study revealed many of the tensions and misconceptions that existed between the two groups, it demonstrated that there is very fertile ground upon which African Americans and Latinos can forge new relationships to combat some of the challenges they face together.</p>
<p>The results of the study were presented Tuesday at Xavier University and were followed by a panel discussion. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study found striking similarities, including:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;A majority of African Americans (56 percent) and Latinos (88 percent) said their communications and language skills were a major factor in the discrimination they face;</p>
<p>*&nbsp;A majority of African Ameri cans (66 percent) and Latinos (59 percent) identified &#8220;access to decent affordable housing&#8221; as a major problem;</p>
<p>Likewise, majorities of both African Americans (69 percent) and Latinos (60 percent) also identified &#8220;receiving fair treatment in the criminal justice system&#8221; as a major problem.</p>
<p>The report also identified some of the obstacles and opportunities for working together on the issues both groups experience:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Language differences and a general lack of social interaction were identified as major barriers to creating alliances for social change in New Orleans;</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Both African Americans (60 percent) and Latinos (63 percent) said a lack of trust between the two groups was also a very major barrier to those alliance;</p>

		<p>I am of the understanding that there were hardly any Hispanics in New Orleans pre-Katrina; their numbers there now are mainly a result of their having been trucked in as cheap labor to rebuild the city.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks and Hispanics have much in common &mdash; except mutual trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is it Ok, and even encouraged, for them to have a shared disdain for whites? It&rsquo;s something they aspire to. They should at least remember, what comes around goes around.  </p>

		<p>I work in New Orleans and live in the suburbs. There were few &#8220;latinos&#8221; here pre-katrina. No, they don&rsquo;t speak English because 90 per cent of them are illegals. I see hordes of them in front of home depot on my way to work in the morning.I know these are illegals, where is I.C.E ? This is a national disgrace!Seems we are adopting the California way, and just look at what&rsquo;s happened to them. </p>

		<p><i>African Americans and Latinos can forge new relationships to combat some of the challenges they face together.</i></p>
<p>This is an inherently racist report. It suggests that &#8220;African Americans and Latinos&#8221; should band together <i>on the basis of race</i> to fight problems it strongly implies are caused by yet another race. PLUS, it implies that this third race faces no similar challenges, which makes the third race the sole wrongdoer. </p>
<p>Americans have heard this kind of racist rhetoric so many times, as well as the rationalizations as to why it is acceptable, that they have become numb to it. But despite the efforts to paint blacks and hispanics as the sole innocent parties, it ends up admitting that these victimized groups still have trouble working together, no doubt a problem caused by the all-powerful &#8220;Man&#8221; who&rsquo;s taught them how to absorb and internalize various &#8220;racist&#8221; attitudes quite against their will. Amazing.</p>

Blacks are still desperate to believe in their mythical alliance with Hispanics.</p>
<p>Blacks should be running from Hispanics and demanding that Hispanics not be given preferences or access to affirmative action. Every affirmative action for a Hispanic means one less for blacks.</p>
<p>Blacks refuse to see this and they&rsquo;re pushing for the advancement of Hispanics and their displacement.</p>
<p>The belief that blacks, with the help of Hispanics, will &#8216;tear down the white power structure&rsquo; will hurt blacks the most and leave them behind again.</p>
<p>Black hatred for whites will be their undoing.<br>

		<p>1. * A majority of African Ameri cans (66 percent) and Latinos (59 percent) identified &ldquo;access to decent affordable housing&rdquo; as a major problem;<br>
2. Likewise, majorities of both African Americans (69 percent) and Latinos (60 percent) also identified &ldquo;receiving fair treatment in the criminal justice system&rdquo; as a major problem.</p>
<p>To address point #1, we already KNOW the results of making &#8220;affordable&#8221; housing to these &#8216;people&rsquo; AND<br>
To address point #2, they are treated fairly by the criminal justice system, they commit most of the crimes,e.g. they get most of the jail time. NOW, why is nothing said anymore about the Malaysian/Indonesian tsunami that wiped out so much??it is because those people got on with their lives and stopped whining and they do not have a welfare government to support them nor a whining, beligerant, entitlement mentality bunch of blacks complaining all the time. With the money sent already to N.O. we could have restored ROME to it&rsquo;s formert glory.</p>

<p>They also have a shared hatred and a long history of fighting each other, and it&rsquo;s getting worse as time goes by.</p>
<p>Just today I read that the business elites in the Bilderberger group, etc., are suggesting further use of the phrase &#8220;green shoots,&#8221; while, at the same time, talking up that the economy is beginning to recover.</p>
<p>And the reason to utilize that psychology?  Because they said it would likely forestall any social unrest from the public, and that just talking as if everything is o.k. could perhaps really improve the economy.</p>
<p>LOL!  Isn&rsquo;t that like saying skin color doesn&rsquo;t matter; not reporting black on white hates crimes, etc., trying to fool the white unwashed masses into thinking those phrases are true to keep them from fighting when blacks commit hate crimes against them?</p>
<p>This whole multicultural, multiracial mess is based on a pack of lies that have to be repeated over and over and over again to keep from having a racial war.</p>

<p>Could this be a result of refusing to learn their native language&hellip;English?  These folks weren&rsquo;t born in the Congo&hellip;if they were they would behave better!</p>

============================================================</p>
<p>The solution is simple: speak PROPER English.  Gutter English isn&rsquo;t English, it is a sub-language. Spanish is the offical language of Mexico and if we lived there, we would be expected to learn it.  I guess stupidity isn&rsquo;t confind to one &#8216;race&rsquo;.</p>
