<h1><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09153/974345-54.stm">Kiski Coach Sues, Alleging Unfair Recruiting</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paula Reed Ward, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A basketball coach recently hired to improve the program at the private Kiski School claimed in a federal lawsuit yesterday that he was forced to quit because the administration did not want him to recruit black players.</p>
<p>But Kiski&rsquo;s headmaster claims that problems with coach Anthony Cheatham had nothing to do with race, and instead had to do with him not following WPIAL rules in how he recruited players.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is absolutely no truth to any allegations of discrimination at the school,&#8221; Brueningsen [headmaster Christopher Brueningsen] said. &#8220;Like most independent schools, we&rsquo;re always looking for ways to increase diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school has 205 students enrolled in grades 9 through 12, along with a handful in a post-graduate program. The students come from 15 countries, and approximately one-third of the school&rsquo;s population are boys of color.</p>
<p>But Cheatham alleges in his lawsuit that when he started recruiting for the school in April, he was told that African-American players were not &#8220;mission appropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[As] information about Kiski&rsquo;s recruiting effort, and the races of many of those recruits became public, Kiski&rsquo;s administration became uneasy,&#8221; the lawsuit said. &#8220;During a number of conversations, Cheatham was told by Kiski administrators that the school could not tolerate a basketball team with five African-American starters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that white recruits who had lower grades and fewer financial resources were accepted over a black prospect with more money and better academic ratings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whether a student is &#8220;mission appropriate,&#8221; he continued, has to do with being able to meet the school&rsquo;s rigorous academic standards and has nothing to do with race or ethnicity.</p>

<p>But it usually ends up that way.  They call it disparate impact.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about PA, but in Missouri, it&rsquo;s illegal to recruit for high school athletics.  That rule got a black St. Louis City high school in trouble several years ago, their coach was cherry picking talent, and inevitably, they would have an aunt, uncle, cousin, grandmother, great aunt, or some relative, that lived in the school&rsquo;s service area and would agree to listing the boy&rsquo;s address as their own.  Failing that, I&rsquo;m sure there were a bunch of &#8220;play mamas&#8221; that the coach had lined up to play along with the scheme.</p>

		<p> Why no photo of Cheatham with the original story? We all know the likely reason for that, don&rsquo;t we? He&rsquo;s probably black   &mdash;   yet another minority trying to cause trouble   &mdash;   so the newspaper doesn&rsquo;t show or mention his race. And why is having &#8220;lower grades and fewer financial resources&#8221; considered a disqualification for White players, when it is considered a trigger for &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; and artificially high representation for blacks? And why didn&rsquo;t the writer of this story explain some of these things, instead of &#8220;writing around them,&#8221; as we used to say in the newspaper business? </p>

		<p>The NFL actively discriminates against White players in the NFL draft.  No one says anything about it, and this is the pros where people make their living.  It&rsquo;s obvious the school above is a private school.  Would you want Blacks there putting their hands in your daughter&rsquo;s blouse and then claiming racism on your part when you voice a complaint about it?</p>

I believe this guy is white:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/qjsmcy</p>
<p>This seems like a he said, he said story. This guy is going to have to prove these allegations.</p>
<p>What was said implicitly or explicitly might be the issue. If something was ambiguous, Mr. Cheatham might have misconstrued what was said. This guy could be angry that he was forced to quit and he knows how to hit back hard. The school is forever guilty even if found innocent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said, there are three sides to every story. Your side, my side, and the truth. We&rsquo;re going to have to wait for more information.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s illegal in all states for <i>public</i> high schools (though it occasionally happens anyway). Kiski is a <i>private</i> high school, and private schools have fewer restrictions on recruiting (or none).</p>
<p>That said, just once I&rsquo;d like to hear a private school headmaster proudly say &#8220;To hell with diversity, we&rsquo;ll have the student body we want,&#8221; or words to that effect.</p>

		<p>This is why I am against school vouchers.  It will give the state and federal governments a reason to say:  &#8220;You took government money so now you must practice affirmative multi-cultural dumbing down&#8221;.  It would another nail in the right of freedom of association.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s illegal in MO even for private schools.  The problem is that it&rsquo;s hard to prove that a private school recruited, because they have their own admission standards and in theory no geographical boundaries.  (The St. Louis Archdiocese draws boundaries for Catholic elementary schools, but as long as you live close enough, you can send your teenage children to any Catholic HS that&rsquo;s close enough.  I should add that not all private HSes in St. Louis and Missouri are Catholic or parochial.)  And since sports recruiting almost always involves boys, and boys and men are far better at collusion than girls and women, the only way to prove recruiting is to hope that someone talks.  Which rarely happens.</p>

		<p>One SF Bay Area school district is notorious for recruiting Oakland &#8220;students&#8221; for their sports teams, so as to boast of a winning record. The entire school district can be reached with a 10 minute drive, so why do some &#8220;students&#8221; need Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) tickets to get to school? You can see them getting off the BART train in the morning and walking to the conveniently located high school, which is about a 400 yard walk from the terminal. When asked for their home addresses, they always come up with an in-town address of an &#8220;auntie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the parents finally hired a private detective to follow these &#8220;students&#8221; to their &#8220;homes,&#8221; some of which were rentals owned by a local real estate agent/school district member.</p>
