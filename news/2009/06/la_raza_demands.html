			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, June 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Monday, June 15, the National Council of La Raza (La Raza), an open borders advocacy group, issued a statement calling upon Congress to ensure that illegal aliens are given health benefits if and when Congress considers health care reform.</p>
<p>La Raza&rsquo;s statement &#8220;strongly urge[d] President Obama and Congress to make every effort to ensure that health care reform reaches all communities&#8221; in the United States, and stressed that &#8220;one out of every three uninsured persons and roughly 40% of all uninsured children [in the United States] are Latino,&#8221; and demanded &#8220;health care reform that makes coverage affordable and accessible for everyone  &mdash;  all families and all children.&#8221;</p>
<p>La Raza President and CEO Janet Murgu√≠a used the statement to emphasize that &#8220;everyone in the U.S. should contribute to a new health system,&#8221; and that &#8220;Latinos [would] accept their responsibility&#8221; to contribute to a new health care system and &#8220;will pay their fair share for the health coverage they need.&#8221;  While the statement does not reference illegal immigration specifically, or distinguish between legal and illegal aliens, it does express concern that adding new, expensive verification and documentation procedures for immigrants would &#8220;severely restrict access to health care coverage.&#8221;  (La Raza Press Release, June 15, 2009).</p>
<p>Specific research has shown that many illegal aliens lack health insurance and represent a disproportionate share of the United States&rsquo; uninsured population.  The Pew Hispanic Center&rsquo;s recent report, A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States, found that 59% of illegal aliens in the United States had no form of health insurance in 2007, and that 45% of illegal alien children were also without health coverage in 2007.  It also found that even the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens were insured at the low rate of 25%, and that there was a significant disparity between the volume of uninsured illegal aliens and the volume of uninsured U.S. citizens and other legal residents.  (Pew Hispanic Center Report, April 14, 2009).</p>
<p>Pew&rsquo;s information has support in federal statistics: data collected by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Census Bureau for the same time frame show that approximately 33.2% of the foreign-born population in the United States (a category which does not differentiate between newly naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents, and illegal aliens) were uninsured in 2007, and that almost 10 million foreign-born non-citizens lacked health insurance in 2007.  (DHS Fact Sheet, February 2009).</p>
<p>(For more information on how illegal immigration is financially impacting the U.S. health care system, see FAIR&rsquo;s Legislative Updates for April 13, 2009, and April 20, 2009).<br>

<p>Well, that means that respectively, 41% of the adult invaders and 55% of their &ldquo;unauthorized&rdquo; urchins, do have some form of health insurance. That is far too many in my book with a social benefit, that they neither deserve or should ever have; these are not citizens, these are not Americans. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!<br>

		<p>Illegal immigrants will be (and already are) an incredible burden to our Nation&rsquo;s health system.  This is because most illegal immigrants have little education, speak little English, have few technical skills,and many carry exotic diseases.  Because these individuals will be unable to earn good salaries, taxpayers (you and I) will have to pay for their health care their entire working lives.  Worse is that they will be unable to save for retirement.  When the 20 million impoverished illegal immigrants retire, that will be the last straw for Social Security and Medicare   &mdash;   A perfect storm for the ultimate destruction of our society. Of course, our government will then tell us that we need to quickly import 200 million more immigrants to &#8220;save Social Security.&#8221;</p>

		<p> The demands on the white race seems to be infinite.How did we become the &#8220;santa claus&#8221; to the entire world? Every time I read about another victim group demanding something I mentally cringe because I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re going to get it from the Congress and Senate who will then turn to us and demand that we pay for it.<br>
 I fear the white race will never wake up to this blatant theft, bigotry, discrimination,racism and their never ending goal to utterly destroy all of us.</p>

		<p>La Raza-The Race- demands that Native Born White Americans subsidize high fertilty hispanic immigrants at county and city hospital maternity wards. Or to put it another La Raza is demanding that Native Born White Americans subsidize their own race-replacement within the borders of America. La Raza-The Race-is waging a vicious race war against the Native Born White Majority.  </p>

		<p>People who are not here legally should not be covered by our health insurance. They should be covered by Mexico&rsquo;s etc. health insurance. We can&rsquo;t afford to provide health care to the rest of the world at our expense. People here illegally either don&rsquo;t pay taxes or pay very little and take far more than they give. Again, just the fact that they are here illegally gives them no right to any benefits. Deport them.</p>

<p>Does this mean that they advocate open borders for Mexico too ? Do they advocate that Mexico open its&rsquo; borders to Americans, other Latin Americans, Africans, Asians, Muslims etc.? No, I thought so, it only applies to the USA, right? Such hypocrits!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;La Raza assures us that all Hispanics will contribute their fair share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they protest conditions in the failed countries they left in Latin America instead of coming up here and dumbing down our country and overburdening it with their illiteracy and lack of skills? </p>
<p>They say this country belongs to &#8220;their people,&#8221; but why do they need another?  They conveniently don&rsquo;t tell us they had a country they left that was an utter failure, because they failed as a people to build one.  If they DID get this country what makes them think they would do any better here than they did before?</p>
<p>Obviously they like this country so much better, because whitey built it into a technological miracle, and they think, like the mentally challenged blacks, that all they have to do is get rid of whitey, slip into the driver&rsquo;s seat, and everything will run just as smoothly.</p>
<p>If they did take over, the fact of the matter is that in no time at all it would look just like Mexico with corruption rampant, schools dumbed down to idiocy levels, and cardboard shacks with tine roofs would be everywhere.</p>
<p>They have already caused our economy to collapse by getting multimillions of loans for homes they couldn&rsquo;t possibly pay for.  California is a good example too of what&rsquo;s in store for this country with more of them coming in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious to see how this is all going to play out as the economy continues to decline to dangerous levels.</p>
<p>There are already shanty towns along the border with raw sewage running down the streets, no electricity or inside toilets right now.  I hope somebody takes a lot of photos now, then another set in two years.</p>

		<p>If LaRaza says the illegal aliens will pay their own share then well I guess its OK.  I didn&rsquo;t know that.  I think we were all worried that they were not going to pay anything like they do now when they crowd into our hospitals forcing many to close.</p>

		<p>It would be interesting to see what would happen if an American &#8220;demanded&#8221; benefits in Mexico. But in America, who knows, the dem congress will probably go along with La Raza&rsquo;s demands.  They have already basically discontinued the  E-Verify program to screen new hires to see if they are legal.  The inmates have clearly taken over the asylum.</p>

<p>Yeah. That makes my blood boil!</p>
<p>I cut my hand at home 2 years ago, went to the emergency room and got 6 stitches, showed my Med. Ins. card, ID and SS card and was on my way.<br>
Got a $508 bill a year later about some &#8220;physician&rsquo;s charges&#8221; my Insurance didn&rsquo;t cover. I blew it off. Got a Court Summons 2 weeks ago saying pay the $508 or fight it out in court and pay court costs &amp; attorny&rsquo;s fees if I lose. I paid that sucker to avoid missing a day of work at court and having to hire a lawyer.</p>
<p>Next time I go to the emergency room, my name is gonna be Jose, and I ain&rsquo;t got no ID and no SS# cuz I&rsquo;m Illegal.<br>
They&rsquo;ll patch me up, and I&rsquo;ll never see a bill. <br>

		<p>In addition to the demand for health benefits for illegal immigrants, what about health care for nonresident citizens of other countries, such as India and Africa?  Given that residents of nations in Africa and regions of India suffer from inadequate health care, aren&rsquo;t we in the USA ethically obliged to provide health care for these and all other citizens of the world who are in need of it?  </p>

		<p>OK, La Raza, you&rsquo;re assuring us all illegal immigrants will pay their fair share. Now would you kindly show us the mathematical voodoo to PROVE how an illegal, earning minimal or sub-minimal wages while claiming the MAXIMUM number of dependents&hellip; is likely to pay ANY TAXES at all! Sorry for bringing this uncomfortable truth up, but I would like to learn just how your claim has any validity, given the reality we see, of Mexican parasitism on a daily basis!</p>

Cool idea unless there is a Spanish Speaker in the ER and there&rsquo;s a real good chance of that! I hope your Spanish is up to snuff. If there isn&rsquo;t an Hispanic there then make sure your Spanish accented English is realistic sounding. Don&rsquo;t try to immitate Pacino as Tony Montana. His accent sucked! IF you get caught impersonating an illegal, you could be facing serious time.</p>

		<p>I simply cannot and will not believe any statistics provided by an outfit calling itself the &#8220;The Pew Hispanic Center,&#8221; which has the audacity to report that &#8220;59% of illegal aliens in the United States had no form of health insurance in 2007, and that 45% of illegal alien children were also without health coverage in 2007.&#8221; The percentage of uninsured illegal aliens is likely closer to 90%, and most likely approaching 100% for Hispanic illegals. Illegals contribute virually nothing to the tax base, other than sales taxes on the luxuries they purchase with the disposable income they get to keep as a result of their having no medical expenses.</p>
<p>And why are the Pew Hispanic Center&rsquo;s figures being reported without comparative figures from opposing viewpoints?</p>

<p>Exactly right. EVERYONE gets health care. The difference is, the illegals never get sent a bill. The hospitals know they won&rsquo;t pay it (they probably gave a fake name and address anyway) and can&rsquo;t be forced to because illegals use CASH ONLY. The collection agencies aren&rsquo;t going to send people to dig up their yard looking for a coffee can full of money.</p>
<p>We really need to go to a biometric ID and e-money only, aside from deporting all illegals, of course.</p>

		<p>My experience has been that in liberal states like Massachusetts and Maryland, illegals lie and obtain Medicaid. They are treated at the best hospitals. Medicaid is for poor people. </p>
<p>Many illegals are not poor. They make good money, are paid in cash, and pay no taxes. Then they get free healthcare financed by US taxpayers and by borrowed money from the Treasury. Citizens&rsquo; kids and grandkids will pay the interest on the debt incurred to subsidize illegal alien health. </p>
<p>Finally, these aliens breed and breed. They love making babies. The babies incur substantial health costs even if healthy. Then the brats(anchor citizens if you will) need health care till they reach adulthood, i.e. 15 or 16. Then more anchor babies. </p>
<p>They know they are swindling us. They laugh at us. They are not stupid. Don&rsquo;t underestimate them. They owe us big. But they will never repay us.</p>
