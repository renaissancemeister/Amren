<h1>City Digitally Adds Black Guy to <cite>Fun Guide</cite> Cover to Make It More &#8216;Inclusive&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Roberts, National Post (Toronto), June 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The smiling, ethnically diverse family featured on the cover of Toronto&rsquo;s latest edition of its summer <cite>Fun Guide</cite> was digitally altered to make the photo more &#8220;inclusive,&#8221; which city officials say is in keeping with a policy to reflect diversity.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the department that publishes the guide listing recreation activities confirmed the publication was doctored to insert the face of a different father.</p>
<p>&#8220;He superimposed the African-Canadian person onto the family cluster in the original photo. It was two photographs and one head was superimposed over the original family photo,&#8221; said John Gosgnach, communications director for the social development division.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal was to depict the diversity of Toronto and its residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cover shot caught the eye of a <cite>National Post</cite> graphics editor, who ran it through a program called TinEye that detects visual enhancements to standard art.</p>
<p>The program showed the original image was of a laughing family of indeterminate ethnic background.</p>
<p>Both the family in the initial photo and the new father inserted were clip art  &mdash;  stock images that publications sometimes purchase to use as illustrations. None are known to be Toronto residents, Mr. Gosgnach said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&rsquo;t find a more inclusive organization than us,&#8221; said Kevin Sack, Toronto&rsquo;s director of strategic communications. &#8220;We want everyone to feel involved and welcome to participate in everything. That&rsquo;s the only goal. Nothing wrong with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move was in accordance with a policy dated April 11, 2008, signed by former city manager Shirley Hoy directing staff to ensure the true kaleidoscope of Toronto residents is represented in all its communications materials.</p>
<p>&#8220;The policy doesn&rsquo;t say PhotoShop, the policy says &#8216;show diversity&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s of course what we try and do because we want all of our publications to reflect the community that we serve,&#8221; explained Mr. Sack, who oversees city communications. &#8220;That&rsquo;s only fair. People should see themselves reflected in city services because it&rsquo;s everyone who uses them.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are no criteria for what constitutes diversity, he acknowledged when asked how the policy is implemented in practice and why the family in the initial image didn&rsquo;t seem to fit the bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s an interesting conversation,&#8221; Mr. Sack said. &#8220;This does not look like a nondescript white family, it looks maybe Latino.&#8221;</p>
<p>While stock photography was used for the current <cite>Fun Guide</cite> cover, city publications such as <cite>Our Toronto</cite> also use original images sometimes. In fact, the city is currently running a photo contest it hopes will supply images of and by Toronto residents for use in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&rsquo;re publishing something with the deadlines and you don&rsquo;t have the right photo, the objective is to communicate the service,&#8221; Mr. Sack said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re in one of the most diverse cities in the world. I hope that doesn&rsquo;t pose a problem for anybody. Capturing that diversity is not difficult. That&rsquo;s been our general experience.&#8221;</p>
