<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/17/south-africa-rape-survey">Quarter of Men in South Africa Admit Rape, Survey Finds</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Smith, Guardian (Manchester), June 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One in four men in South Africa have admitted to rape and many confess to attacking more than one victim, according to a study that exposes the country&rsquo;s endemic culture of sexual violence.</p>
<p>Three out of four rapists first attacked while still in their teens, the study found. One in 20 men said they had raped a woman or girl in the last year.</p>
<p>South Africa is notorious for having one of the highest levels of rape in the world. Only a fraction are reported, and only a fraction of those lead to a conviction.</p>
<p>The study into rape and HIV, by the country&rsquo;s Medical Research Council (MRC), asked men to tap their answers into a Palm Pilot device to guarantee anonymity. The method appears to have produced some unusually frank responses.</p>
<p>Professor Rachel Jewkes of the MRC, who carried out the research, said: &#8220;We have a very, very high prevalence of rape in South Africa. I think it is down to ideas about masculinity based on gender hierarchy and the sexual entitlement of men. It&rsquo;s rooted in an African ideal of manhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jewkes and her colleagues interviewed a representative sample of 1,738 men in South Africa&rsquo;s Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p>
<p>Of those surveyed, 28% said they had raped a woman or girl, and 3% said they had raped a man or boy. Almost half who said they had carried out a rape admitted they had done so more than once, with 73% saying they had carried out their first assault before the age of 20.</p>
<p>The study, which had British funding, also found that men who are physically violent towards women are twice as likely to be HIV-positive. They are also more likely to pay for sex and to not use condoms.</p>
<p>Any woman raped by a man over the age of 25 has a one in four chance of her attacker being HIV-positive.</p>
<p>One in 10 men said they had been forced to have sex with another man. Many find it difficult to report such attacks to the police in subcultures where the concept of homosexuality is taboo.</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s government has been repeatedly criticised for failing to address the crisis. Only 7% of reported rapes are estimated to lead to a conviction. Jewkes said: &#8220;There&rsquo;s been a lot of concern about the way the criminal justice system works, because it&rsquo;s still woeful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before his election as president, Jacob Zuma stood trial for the rape of a family friend. His supporters demonstrated at the court house, verbally attacked his accuser and sang &#8220;burn the bitch, burn the bitch&#8221;. Zuma was eventually acquitted.</p>
<p>Jewkes added: &#8220;The social space for debating these gender issues is now smaller than it was a few years ago. We need our government to show political leadership in changing attitudes. We need South African men, from the top to the grassroots, to take responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anti-rape campaigners said the shocking figures demonstrated the need for reform. Dean Peacock, co-director of the Sonke Gender Justice project, said: &#8220;We need to make sure the criminal justice system is held to account. We have lots of discussion in this country, but not enough action is taken to ensure that perpetrators will face consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zuma, a polygamist, was criticised for emphasising his Zulu tribal identity and singing militant songs during this year&rsquo;s election campaign. He made comments that outraged anti-Aids and gender campaigners.</p>
<p>Peacock added: &#8220;We&rsquo;re at a complicated moment in South African history with revived traditionalism and there&rsquo;s a danger of gender transformation being lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hear men saying, &#8216;If Jacob Zuma can have many wives, I can have many girlfriends.&rsquo; The hyper-masculine rhetoric of the Zuma campaign is going to set back our work in challenging the old model of masculinity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carrie Shelver, an activist with People Opposing Women Abuse, said: &#8220;Generally there&rsquo;s a deficit of understanding and commitment to women&rsquo;s rights by the leadership of this country. It&rsquo;s simply not on people&rsquo;s agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>A report published by the trade union Solidarity earlier this month said that one child is raped in South Africa every three minutes, with 88% of rapes going unreported. It found that levels of child abuse in South Africa are increasing rapidly.<br/>

		<p>These numbers are very unsettling, but not altogether surprising.  Just think, 28% of men ADMIT to raping someone.  Logically, you can assume that the total percentage of men who have raped someone is significantly higher due to the fact that many men would not want to admit being a rapist.</p>
<p>The sad thing is statistics like these largely go unreported by major news outlets.  Anything that portrays Black South Africans in a poor light makes the liberal media very uncomfortable.  It shatters the delicate imaginary utopia that they believe would exist in South Africa if those darn whites would stop oppressing those poor, innocent Blacks.<br/>

<p>So what does that mean:  1 in 2 blacks, and 0 in 2 whites?</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m sure the real statistics are awful, I can&rsquo;t help but thinking that more blacks admit to rape that have actually raped.  False bravado, and all that.</p>

<p>i.e. it&rsquo;s a cultural thing of a non-white people, so who are we whites to criticize it?</p>

		<p>I am sure this matter will not get high priority on any Western feminists&rsquo; political agenda.  It&rsquo;s only the rare white male rapists that they obsess about.  South Africa&rsquo;s extraordinary level of rape will simply be dismissed as a legacy of apartheid, and another reason to bash on white men.<br/>

&ldquo;We have a very, very high prevalence of rape in South Africa. I think it is down to ideas about masculinity based on gender hierarchy and the sexual entitlement of men. It&rsquo;s rooted in an African ideal of manhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br/>
Once upon a time, when we were all living in caves, rape and other routine sexual abuse of women was probably rooted in EVERYBODY&rsquo;S ideal of manhood. The difference is, as those of us whose ancestors LEFT Africa, our menfolk evolved and eventually traded their paleolithic notion of the rightness of rape for our modern civilized notion of the rightness of married monogamy. </p>
<p>One by one, whites, yellows, and even most of the world&rsquo;s browns, learned not to rape. Every color on earth made this transition and, collectively, OUTGREW the crude idea that females are there for males&rsquo; instant sexual gratification&hellip; every color except BLACK. </p>

<p>Hilarious, what liars these people are.  Translation: blacks got what they wanted, so they have no further need for ideological role-playing for the benefit of clueless whites.</p>
<p>Apparently these liars are like flies with dung; they&rsquo;ll keep on with their idiocy until the Day of the Burning Tire Necklaces forces them out.  Then they&rsquo;ll move on to the next country clueless enough to permit them.</p>

		<p>Publishing this must have led to anguished soul-searching at the &#8216;Guardian&rsquo; newspaper.</p>
<p>Guardianista thinking is easily grasped:</p>
<p>*  Blacks are good. South African blacks are especially good, having suffered oppression.</p>
<p>*  Rape is very very bad. Wimmin are far better beings than men.</p>
<p>We may be certain that this rape epidemic is not the responsibility of whites, Asians or Cape Coloureds [the mixed-race community.]</p>
<p>South Africa is sliding downwards. See it while it&rsquo;s still fairly safe.<br/>

		<p>One of the most depressing aspects about modern American politics is that the Democratic Party has essentially degenerated into a rag-bag of special interests (the so-called &#8216;Rainbow Alliance&rsquo;), whose only defining feature and point of unity is the urge to legislate the marginilisation of White men.<br/>
  Two of the chiefest playersin this alliance (in terms of sheer voting power) are blacks and White women.<br/>
  You see, for reasons that are probably deeply Freudian White women have made common political cause with blacks in the both conscious and unconscious urge to &#8216;castrate&rsquo; White men by means of legalized discrimination - and this urge generally trumps all concern with the real stuff of politics - ie  policy detail.<br/>
   - But as this report from South Africa shows White women are playing a very dangerous game, a game above primeval vindictive urges and whose ultimate price is dire.<br/>

		<p>Just wait for the soccer world championship, held in SA. That will be nasty :)</p>
<p>I have read in a german newspaper, that they sent there a (possibly leftist) scribbler and also another spanish scribbler was sent to SA for a weeks time with 1000EUR cash and the sole goal to survive. Take it as an experiment&hellip;</p>
<p>The german guy was ripped of by two police officers, who didnt  let himm pass a street without paying (2x 20EUR in local currency).</p>
<p>The spanish guy wasnt that lucky, he was mugged the very first day.</p>

		<p>A lot of people who read this will be morally outraged at black South Africans for having such high rape statistics. I am not. I believe human behavior is largely driven by genetics and this is exactly the kind of behavior I would expect from black South Africans.</p>
<p>The important thing to learn from this is that whites have an obligation to protect themselves from black crime. Racial separation is absolutely necessary. We should not hate blacks for acting like blacks, but we should certianly protect ourselves from them.</p>
<p>When the reality of race is understand whites will understand black behavior and have realistic expectations for them, they won&rsquo;t hate them for acting like blacks. </p>
<p>Because blacks are on average so much less inteligent than whites and north asians, as Prof. Braun has pointed out, black crime cannot be judged with the same moral severity that white crime can be, because blacks lack the ability to make moral judgements to the degree that whites can. </p>
<p>The people we should direct our anger at (for black on white rape) is our white politicians who allow blacks to live here and immigrate to the west.</p>

		<p>Charles:</p>
<p>The only slight disagreement with you that I have is this:  I don&rsquo;t think it takes a high IQ or even an average IQ to know that there is right and wrong, and to know the difference between the two.  Reading between the lines, these black men who admit to rape know that it&rsquo;s wrong, but default to their hedonism as an excuse.  It&rsquo;s the difference between immoral and amoral.  Now, those who are blatantly handicapped mentally, (used to be called retarded), I can understand if they don&rsquo;t know the difference.<br/>
