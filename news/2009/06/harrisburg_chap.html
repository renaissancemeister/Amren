			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven Farley, Patriot-News (Harrisburg, Pa.), June 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Harrisburg Chapter of the NAACP is calling on Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell to suspend some civil liberties and impose martial law in the city to halt the wave of recent lawlessness. </p>
<p>Chapter President Stanley Lawson also called on Rendell to bring in the state National Guard for at least 30 days and to impose a curfew. In June, there have been at least 12 shootings, many of them in the daytime, including a man killed Wednesday at a busy city intersection during the lunch hour. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Guard is for floods and natural disasters. I don&rsquo;t know any more of a natural disaster than of our young people being killed,&#8221; he said at a general membership meeting of about 25 people at Capitol Presbyterian Church, 14th and Cumberland streets. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re beyond what the Harrisburg police department can do. We need help,&#8221; Lawson said. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Lawson noted that there was historical precedent for the Guard to step in, recalling the race riots in 1968 following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King in Memphis, Tenn. </p>
<p>Lawson said that many reasons have been given for the wave of shootings, such as drugs, robberies and neighborhood turf wars. Fear is the bigger reason, he suggested. </p>
<p>&#8220;The young men, it&rsquo;s fear, it&rsquo;s just fear. They think: &#8216;I&rsquo;m going to get them before they get me,&rsquo;&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Member and attorney Stanley Mitchell noted the civil rights organization is asking for a short suspension of some civil rights, but added: &#8220;We have the civil rights not to be shot.&#8221;<br>

<p>And let me guess what will happen:<br>
* Should &#8220;martial law&#8221; be imposed, arrests for those behind the violence will be - surprise! - predominantly black.<br>
* Which will cause much weeping and gnashing of teeth by the NAACP and the &#8220;black community&#8221; of Harrisburg at the &#8220;appalling racism and discrimination&#8221; behind the &#8220;disproportionate arrests (though they will never mention convictions)&#8221; of blacks for the violence?</p>

		<p>You have to resist it wherever possible.  Black people will BEG you to come take over their towns and keep them from killing each other.  They will fall down on their knees and call you a racist if you don&rsquo;t stop their children from slaughtering them.</p>
<p>But as sure as God makes little greeen apples, as soon as the emergency is over, they will be back to their cop killing ways, complaining that the white man is stopping them for no reason on the roads, claiming that crack cocaine penalties are a white man&rsquo;s conspiracy and such like.</p>
<p>We already went through this same drill 20 years ago.  Black folks begged the government to whomp up on their homicidal children and put them in jail.  Black legislators explained how crack cocaine was extra special bad, much worse than white powder cocaine, and how the government had to crack down on the ghetto.  White folks resisted as long as we could, right up until the black folks started calling us racist for not cracking down on the ghetto.  They demanded that htepenaltiesbe raised for crack cocaine!</p>
<p>Once the emergency was over they started bitching and whining about how the difference in penalties for crackand powder cocaine(were racist, and how America was racist because so many black men were in jail.  They pretended like it never happened, pretended like they never begged us to crack down on crack!</p>
<p>We should NOt roll out the National Guard. I swear they are going to do it again.  As soon as someone brutha or sistah gets hurt, they are going to start p!ssing and moaning about Evil White Folks again just like they did the last time.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this play out before.  When the crack epidemic of the 80s was literally destroying black communities their &#8220;leaders&#8221; cried out for the law to do something.  In particular they asked for stiffer penalties for crack cocaine as opposed to powder because in crack form it was directly affecting black communities.  Fast forward to today and we have black &#8220;leaders&#8221; crying out that sentences being higher for crack is racism.  If the guard is called in here and ANY black is shot by them, right or wrong, all hell will break loose in the country and we&rsquo;ll hear about it for at least a decade.</p>

		<p>Honestly, the disaster is Blacks themselves.  No flood, no fire, no earthquake, not even a riot, just Blacks getting a little more out of hand than usual.  It must be humiliating to civilized Blacks, and I can understand the envy and hatred so many Blacks feel toward Whites.  How is it, they must wonder, that White people can just live their lives without endemic violence?  </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s this thing called karma.  The NAACP has spent decades forcing the political system to endow civil rights on thugs, and when it&rsquo;s no surprise that thugs start behaving wildly, the NAACP wants to take it all back.  Mississippi knew what it was doing.  The Harrisburg PD isn&rsquo;t lost, the NAACP has handcuffed it with civil rights laws.</p>
<p>You watch   &mdash;   if Fast Eddie Rendell does this, within 90 days, the same people who wanted the martial law will complain that Rendell and the NG are &#8220;picking on them&#8221; and racially profiling.  I thought all these thugs were going to start behaving in the era of Obama.</p>

		<p>I agree that this IS a natural disaster. It&rsquo;s natural for blacks to behave this way. But sending in the National Guard will open up a flood of &#8220;ghetto lottery&#8221; lawsuits, unless they&rsquo;re all BLACK National Guardsmen, which will then make the situation even worse.</p>

		<p>Does the NAACP intend  martial law apply to all people or just for blacks? doesn&rsquo;t seem fair to get the Amish involved, or any other non-blacks for that matter. It&rsquo;s getting old seeing 88% of the population being compelled to live like the other 12%. That&rsquo;s the lowest common denominator theory, and I don&rsquo;t care for it </p>

		<p>While we are suspending civil rights because of rampant black crime, I suggest we also suspend the Second Amendment for young black males considering that they make up 3 to 4 percent of the population but commit about 60 percent of the crime in America.</p>

		<p>So instead of the black &#8220;leaders&#8221; stepping up like men and telling their out of control black teens to stop killing, they want the State National Guard (an entity created by whites) to come in and clean up their mess.  That takes a lot of nerve.  </p>

		<p>How stupid, that the NAACP is calling for martial law, because some Bantus are shooting and killing each other; during their chimpouts. I believe that stupid people like Stan Lawson and Stanley Mitchell are more dangerous to this country than all the Taepdong missiles in Kim Jong Il&rsquo;s arsenal. They are calling for all people in Harrisburg, PA to live under a police state because Willie Africa and Jamal Aziz cannot get along. The lawyer Mitchell, then says they have the &#8220;civil rights, not to be shot&#8221;. The only bar Mitchell passed, apparently, is the one where he stopped to have a bottle of his rot-gut  whiskey.</p>
<p>It never fails - Bantus are always the first to go running to the government to correct their foulups. It was the way with the Los Angeles ripts of 1992, the 1967 Detroit riots and Watts riots in 1965.</p>
<p>Cry me a river, NAACP! No decent person in Harrisburg, PA - or anywhere else - should have to live under martial law, because your people go on a chimpout.</p>

<i>&ldquo;We have the civil rights not to be shot.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>For blacks, invoking the phrase &#8220;civil rights&#8221; has taken on mythical powers. Just saying the words is supposed to stop the world and solve a problem. Jobs are a civil right. Housing is a civil right. Education is a civil right. A safe neighborhood is a civil right. Health care is a civil right. </p>
<p>The phrase, as blacks now over use it, has become meaningless.</p>

		<p> Why is it that with blacks you&rsquo;re worng if you do and wrong if you do not? This is not a rhetorical question. I&rsquo;ve read articles like these for years and inevitably the outcome is always the same, they demand, the whites give, then they&rsquo;re insulted and angry becuse the white man has the audacity to do what they want.<br>
 I expect this kind of reaction from children that cannot fathom the result of their demands, but these are supposed to be adult leaders of their community. They should understand cause and effect, the consquences of bad decisions and paying for the resulting chaos.<br>
 This sort of activity is a luxury the white race can no longer afford. If they, as a race, refuse to mature, accept penalties for their actions and at least attempt to join the rest of te civilized world then it may be time to rethink our strategy.</p>

Last week on a local black radio talk show, there were two black women BEGGING for the police to do SOMETHING to save their community from violence and drugs.</p>
<p>Everything with blacks is damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s always lose-lose, no-win. The SOLUTION to the problem (arresting black criminals) eventually morphs into the PROBLEM (too many black men in jail).</p>
<p>Too many black criminals becomes too many black men in jail which need to be released which leads to too many black criminals on the street and then too many black men in jail and on and on and on&hellip;</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t win. You can&rsquo;t break even. Lose-lose. Blacks are a hopeless race.</p>

		<p>The black community will tell you it is poverty that leads to crime and violence. Hogwash.  I was born in Mckeesport in 1950. My dad wasn&rsquo;t there after I was 18 months old. We live (my mother, grandmother and me) in a low income housing apartments known as Crawford Village.  Even though it was low income and mostly working poor, it was a safe neighborhood.  I could go out to play for hours at age 5 and they didn&rsquo;t worry about me. I could walk to school in first grade - school was about a mile away. All my life I had been curious about my early childhood (we moved to Kansas in 1959. How could I live in a safe neighborhood even though we was poor. Had society changed that much from 1959 to 1965 (as we watched the Watts Riots live on TV).<br>
I got my answer just a few months ago. While searching the internet I found out that there was a No Black policy for Crawford Village until 1971. So, there you go. Take it from this former bleeding heart liberal.  Now I understand the segregationist were not against blacks because the color of their skin. They didn&rsquo;t want to integrate crime into white schools and nieghborhoods.</p>

		<p>How many black areas of the country have conditions just as bad or worse than this area?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s every urban area with a high black population, of course.  And, to a lesser extent, the mestizos.</p>
<p>These areas have gotten progressively worse for many years now.  One of the biggest aggravating factors is the rhetoric coming from the white radicals on the left, which, of course, includes the entire media and the entertainment industry.  They not only condone black crime, they encourage it and glorify it in movies. </p>
<p>Obama thanked the screwball Hollywood filmaker the other day and said if it weren&rsquo;t for him he (Obama) would never have been president.  Of course he was talking about the promotion of blacks in the movies, always depicting just the opposite of reality.  Personally, however, I doubt that Hollywood has been a bigger assist than the oddballs, flakes and misfits in the mainstream media, some of whom now bow upon greeting him.</p>
<p>The entire cast of leftist geeks from all different segments of this society, however, absolutely love to think that anybody who analyzes current events, based upon a myriad of factors, who determines that this society just cannot hold together, is ridiculed as &#8220;redneck,&#8221; conspiracy nut,&#8221; &#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;white supremacist,&#8221; and one of the &#8220;black holicopter crowd.&#8221;  And they do so completely oblivious to the fact that most of these analysts are making logical, educated deductions, based on absolute facts, and a global history of experience that indicates the present kind of social structure has always failed.  </p>
<p>The consensus of common logic involving persons not beset with a mental disorder would probably conclude that these same leftist radicals would be quite unsettled upon learning that literally dozens of reputable scholars and highly educated analysts are warning of destruction.  It is far more than just a few bloggers whom they can blow off with a denigrating slur.  But, have no illusions about it.  They don&rsquo;t think their utopia will ever fail.  Everybody is out of step, but them.</p>
<p>This is a time in history where the La La crowd and the fantasy nuts are in control, although they do not comprise a majority of the population. It&rsquo;s an odd situation, but it will prove to be a fatal one for the future of this country as it now exists.</p>
<p>I am ABSOLUTELY certain the National Guard, and likely the Army, will soon be deployed in several areas of this country, because the black crime and violence will continue to accelerate.  And the street level mestizos and blacks don&rsquo;t give a rap for the unbrella they&rsquo;ve been forced under by their leadership.  They&rsquo;ll be up in arms eventually.  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time.  <br>

		<p>Harrisburg is neither in Amish country or Murtha&rsquo;s country.  It is represented in the US House by Democrat Tim Holden. The city is a squalid dump and the seat of PA state government.  Dauphin, the county in which it is located, has the second highest incarceration rate in the state.  It is only second to (you guessed it) Philadelphia in the number of its residents jailed as a percentage of the county population.  </p>

		<p>This is what 40 years of giving in has gotten us. The black community with it&rsquo;s welfare,free housing and no daddy at home policy has completely back fired and we are seeing the results. No matter how much money the Liberals want to throw at this problem it is just going to get worse. When we start understanding that it&rsquo;s not poverty or education or entitlements that cause this, but the behavior and mentality of blacks themselves that cause the problem. We are going to have to accept the fact that blacks will not ever conform to be a decent society. The natural tendencies of laziness,crime and just plain bad attitude is inherent in blacks.Instead of working,they wait for the check. Instead of working, they rob and kill. It&rsquo;s the truth and no amount of sugar coating is going to change it. And the fear of being called &#8220;racist&#8221; just adds to the problem. When is telling the truth, Racism? Most people know this and more and more are willing to speak out. If you wait until it invades your community then it will be too late. No amount of money or social programs will change anything. For 40 years we have listening to this hogwash. &#8220;If you give us more money then that will fix it&#8221;. Well folks it hasn&rsquo;t and never will. Yes,it would be wonderful if blacks could live and prosper in society and a few actually do but,for the most part they live in a different world. Look at Detroit,once the most prosperous city in America. Now it is a hell hole,that look really like a third world country.And others like Compton,Trenton,Oakland and Harrisburg are falling like domino&rsquo;s.Wake up and smell the coffee! We have to change the way we are doing things in this country about this problem and more money and hand holding isn&rsquo;t the answer. We are going to have to lock the thugs away for good and put more cops on the street in bad areas and make blacks responsible for their actions and their communities. After 40 years of fumbling the ball there is no quick fix. But I do know this, if we don&rsquo;t start now then this problem will never be addressed and we can be sure that we will be a victim of black crime sometime in the future. If you haven&rsquo;t been already.</p>
