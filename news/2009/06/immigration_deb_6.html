<h1><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/16/AR2009061603518.html">Immigration Debate Tied to Rise in Hate Crimes</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Spencer S. Hsu, Washington Post, June 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. civil rights leaders said yesterday that an increase in hate crimes committed in recent years against Hispanics and people perceived to be immigrants &#8220;correlates closely&#8221; to the nation&rsquo;s increasingly contentious debate over immigration.</p>
<p>Hate crimes targeting Hispanic Americans rose 40 percent from 2003 to 2007, the most recent year for which FBI statistics are available, from 426 to 595 incidents, marking the fourth consecutive year of increases.</p>
<p>The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Education Fund issued a report that faulted anti-immigrant rhetoric in the media and mobilization of extremist groups on the Internet. The conference said that some groups advocating for tighter immigration laws have invoked &#8220;the dehumanizing, racist stereotypes and bigotry of hate groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The FBI reported in October that the number of hate crimes dropped in 2007 by about 1 percent, to 7,624. But violence against Latinos and gay people bucked the trend. The number of hate crimes directed at gay men and lesbians increased about 6 percent, the FBI reported.</p>

		<p>Hate crimes against Hispanics are mainly at the hands of blacks.  Hate crimes against blacks are mainly at the hands of Hispanics (though Hispanic criminals are counted as &#8220;white&#8221; on the official books).  Hate crimes against Jews are mainly at the hands of Muslims.  Hate crimes against LGBT I&rsquo;m not so sure about, but I&rsquo;m guessing that if they happen in big cities, they&rsquo;re mainly at the hands of blacks.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Civil rights&rdquo; group needs to be reminded that correlation does not imply causation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good point, but I can assure you even they aren&rsquo;t so dimwitted they don&rsquo;t know better.</p>
<p>In their clumsy way, they&rsquo;re in their usual attack mode against anything, anybody, and everything that they perceive to constitute a threat to their hare-brained scemes in support of everything that they think will cause a weakening of the white power structure.  Like too many white guys in all white groups.  Then it&rsquo;s not an individual threat.  It&rsquo;s an armed militia threatening to do evil to their near perfect population.</p>
<p>The greatest threat on earth to this country is something that should be recognized by them and discussed freely on every talk show in America.  It is the black crime problem.  It is the problem of trying to teach low intelligence blacks to be smart and dumbing down the curriculum so they won&rsquo;t fall behind too quickly.  It is the black lack of desire to learn a trade, their propensity for violence, their eagerness to sell dope rather than work.  In short, the big problem today is having blacks in our country.  The next biggest problem is importing crime, stupidity and poverty from third world.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve identified the REAL problem(s), here&rsquo;s hoping we can do the intelligent and honest thing and bring the entire matter up for national discussion in order to find a solution to it.</p>
<p>And, of course, leading the discussion, will be the community organizer himself, Barack, &#8220;the messiah&#8221; Obama.  I can hardly wait to hear all the forthright, honest opinions.</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but what about the rights and dignity of a fly?</p>
<p>Look below and witness the hate crime against this fly, who simply wanted a better life:</p>

		<p>This rise in &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; is tied to immigration.  The more diverse a society the more tribal conflict, especially among the lower classes.  It has nothing to do with a &#8220;discussion&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Barack should thank his lucky stars that he could and should think of himself as a Caucasian [son of a high-IQ white mother] with a one-half admixture of pure Kenyan blood. He also benefits from being reared by his white grandparents, as well as a soupçon of heterozygotic advantage (heterosis /&#8221;hybrid vigour&rdquo;). He is no more representative of African-Americans (a population with a history and gene pool wholly different from Kenyans) than Greg Louganis and Keanu Reeves typify Asian-Pacific islanders. <br>
