<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More angry scenes erupted in Sydney&rsquo;s west overnight as tensions increased between local Indian students and the Lebanese community.</p>
<p>About 70 students gathered in the heart of Harris Park, but this time they were confronted by local Lebanese youths.</p>
<p>Police were forced to hold back the angry mob in the third straight night of protests.</p>
<p>The Indian protesters continue to say they are being attacked by Lebanese youths and police are ignoring their pleas for protection.</p>
<p>A man was issued with a court notice for carrying an offensive weapon after being allegedly found with a piece of timber during a police search.</p>
<p>Earlier, Parramatta Council held a meeting with police, India&rsquo;s consul general and members of Sydney&rsquo;s Indian community, with organisers saying students had agreed to stop protesting.</p>
<p>But the flare-up that occurred after the meeting has left Indian leaders exasperated and some locals are concerned there could be fresh outbreaks of violence in the backstreets of western Sydney.</p>

								<h2>Australian PM Urges Calm After &lsquo;Racial&rsquo; Attacks</h2>
						<p>
							<i>CNN, June 10, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd called for calm Wednesday, assuring the Indian community that his country was still one of the safest study destinations in the world despite a series of attacks on Indian students in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p>Australia insists the attacks are not racial, but rather &#8220;a regrettable part of urban life,&#8221; as Rudd put it in a radio interview on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Authorities say the Indian students are victims of opportunistic criminal gangs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite often, they are catching trains home from work late in the evening as many do not have access to cars,&#8221; said Simon Overland, chief commissioner for the Victoria state police. &#8220;They are often traveling alone and this is leaving them vulnerable to crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian community, however, alleges gangs are specifically targeting Indians. Activists say there have been about 1,500 attacks a year for the last three years  &mdash;  but lately, they have picked up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Saying that they are tired of waiting for the Australian government to take action, Indian students  &mdash;  armed with bats  &mdash;  patrolled subway stations in the worst-affected suburbs Monday and Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Monday night, flag-waving Indians attacked a carload of Lebanese men in retaliation for the alleged assault of two Indian men by a group of ethic Lebanese earlier in the day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s unacceptable for anyone to commit an act of violence against any student of any ethnicity anywhere in Australia,&#8221; Rudd said in the interview with the station 3AW. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s equally unacceptable for so-called &#8216;reprisal attacks&rsquo; and for so-called &#8216;vigilante&rsquo; action as well.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t just Australia that is having problems with multiculturalism.  The whole world is a battleground wherever people of different, ethnicities, races, and religions, live close to one another.</p>
<p>The worst thing to do would of course be to ENCOURAGE the intermixing of people who are of different races, culture, religion and political agendas.  </p>
<p>And, since that is exactly what is happening today throughout the West, how could anyone with half-a-brain think that any amount of cliches or 1984 propaganda could keep things on an even keel for very long?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that it isn&rsquo;t possible to continue on indefinitely in that manner and that&rsquo;s why the West will not be able to continue on for much longer.</p>
<p>Australia is just one tiny area.  Put them all together and the potential for death and destruction is insurmountable.</p>

		<p>I lived in the Sydney suburb of Randwick, near UNSW for 14 months, and I would be the first to say that genuine Australians and some of us Septic Yanks make the worst possible victims for violent crime one could imagine.  </p>
<p>My best friend there was as sweet as a summer day, and could talk feral cats into his arms.  He used those for shark bait.</p>
<p>I am completely unsuprised that it is Indians the Muslims are attacking, and not genuine Ockers.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s proof that the attacks on Indians are at the hands of other non-whites.  I had a chatroom friend that grew up in Parramatta; he tells me that the Lebanese are disproportionately represented in the crime statistics.  Certain public transportation stations are unusable because of the rowdy behavior of, as he called them, &#8220;Leb teens.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As I said before, Indians disgust me more than any other group.  They have this arrogance about their people that they haven&rsquo;t even earned yet.  They believe in false histories about how India was an advanced country that produced the roots of modern science before whites ever got a hold of it.  And then the British went in and destroyed everything.  Indians are hateful people.  They come and live in our countries but they don&rsquo;t acknowledge the superiority of Western Civilization. </p>

<p>Which is true of many foreigners that come to these shores.  In addition to thinking they&rsquo;re superior, they think their countries are as well, and they laud everything about them, declaring how much greater they are than this country.  Notice the flags in their offices, yards, etc.?</p>
<p>But, strangely enough, they are just a bit too dim witted to understand that coming to our country proves the one they left is inferior and they are as well for not being able to build a better one. </p>

		<p>A week ago, this was evidence of &#8216;hate&rsquo; in Australia, and proof that white society needed to be adjusted. Now that it turns out it&rsquo;s protected people of color who are attacking Indians. I&rsquo;m guessing the Australian public haven&rsquo;t been given the real details. Perhaps they can turn the USA, where we have a successful multicultural society (sic), for advice on how to educate and inform the public about the real truth? </p>

		<p>i agree that some indians can be arrogant. but most of the indians ive dealt with have been polite and honest. so i tend to think moslems are the instigators here. i dont blame indians for taking up for themselves. but the real bad guy here is Rudd. he&rsquo;s a schmuck and he&rsquo;s let ethnic gangs get out of hand.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that Indians here (from India, not American Indians) are getting more and more hostile towards Whites.  It is not surprising.  I was at a gas station today and asked the Indian attendant if he could check my oil.  He mumbled something that any red-blooded American of European descent would NOT have understood and then went to service another vehicle.  When he came to me again, I asked him the same question and he said, I just say to you, I busy, with a hostile look on his face.</p>
<p>Wait until their numbers increase.  Wait.  A hated and hunted minority will be   &mdash;   US-Whites.</p>

		<p>Amren readers might not care to think of it this way but many Lebanese feel they had to &#8220;fight&#8221; (against whites) to establish themselves in Australia and it galls them to see Indians receiving the red-carpet treatment while moving into Lebanese neighborhoods.  </p>
<p>This completely exposes the sham that is &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  Inter-ethnic violence that doesn&rsquo;t involve whites can only be a good thing as far as raising racial consciousness goes.</p>

   Now it&rsquo;s clear that Lebanese (a population that in all honesty cannot be called White - their nation is not European, their predominant culture is Islamic and oriental, even if a distict minority of them tend to phenotypically White), are doing the thuggery.<br>
   I think an apology is owed to decent white Australians for the calumny thrown at them.</p>

		<p>I thought that it is only bad Pakistanis that riot in the West. By and by, Indians are beginning to show their true colours. They did not riot in Australia only, they burnt effigy of Australian prime minister in Delhi. The truth is finally catching up with Indian propaganda about bad Pakistanis and good and smart Indians. Hope there are not many people that got fooled by our MSM relentlessly spouting nonsense about Indians in the West. After all, you cannot create two different peoples that are bound by common history,culture,race and backwardness just by drawing some abstract lines across the subcontinent.</p>

		<p><i>Now it&rsquo;s clear that Lebanese (a population that in all honesty cannot be called White - their nation is not European, their predominant culture is Islamic and oriental</i></p>
<p>Although the Lebanese were originally classed as Asiatics under the White Australia policy,  as early as the 1920s this definition had laready been relaxed and thousands entered Australia in the inter-war years - thus under the White Australia policy they were effectively considered white. </p>
<p>These early waves of Lebanese were I think mainly Maronite Christians. In the past two to three decades most of the Lebanese arriving in Australia have been Muslim. The earlier lot became well integrated and established within the local population. The latter not so well obviously - at least yet.</p>
<p>So its not necessarily race that is the decider who will fit in or not fit in - but more so religion and culture. That is why many here would probably accept Armenians and Georgians as white, but not Turks or Azerbaijanis.<br>

<p>Well PM Kevin Rudd meets most of that criteria. He is no Australian patriot but a willing tool who organised the South-East Asian pretend &#8216;trade group&rsquo; of countries, a version of the EU/NAU (North America Union) for his NWO bosses. Why Western countries keep electing these neo-Marxist Socialists is beyond me. Labour v Conservatives, Republican v Democrats, it&rsquo;s all a sham. They are all pro-One World government. Build small nationalist parties and forget the political elite&rsquo;s Tweedledee/Tweedledum political parties scam.<br>

		<p>Anonymous - all Australians bar the PC idiots (you can read their rubbish online) know the truth, especially those of us who live in Sydney and have watched it for years. Is this attack by MOMEAs (Men of Middle Eastern Appearance) on a 72 year pensioner &#8216;racial&rsquo;? Hell no, he isn&rsquo;t an Indian, merely a white Australian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Robbed of $50, then bashed for the hell of it</p>
<p>&hellip;.Superintendent Marcon said the man was attacked while walking through Boronia Park at Epping at 6pm on Thursday, June 4. As he neared the war memorial in the park, two men approached and demanded his wallet.</p>
<p>Superintendent Marcon said the offenders were described as being of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean appearance, aged 17 to 21, 175 centimetres tall and of medium build. Both had short, black hair and were clean shaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, but in the overall scheme of things is this stuff going on in Australia really going to break apart society? Or is it a relatively minor problem when you look at the big picture.</p>
<p>Europe went for centuries with only one race, more or less. Were things any less violent then? What about Asia or Africa? Is there naturally going to be less violence, less conflict, less hatred, where all the people are the same race?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Is there naturally going to be less violence, less conflict, less hatred, where all the people are the same race?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fair question and the answer is generally yes.  The U.S. had very low crime rates in the 1950&rsquo;s and early 1960&rsquo;s during the great immigration pause that began in the 1920&rsquo;s.  Declining immigration from Italy was an important factor in the decline of the mafia for example.  Government forced racial integration contributed to the exploding crime rates in the late 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Crime rates have go up significantly in the UK the past few decades and third world immigrants are disproportionately involved in it.  Crimes that used to be unheard of in Britain like honor killings are being brought to the country by third world immigrants.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor in &#8220;In Praise of Homogeneity&#8221; detailed how much of the peace, social cohesion, and economic strength of Japan is due to racial and cultural homogeneity.</p>
<p>Robert Putnam, the liberal author of &#8220;Bowling Alone&#8221;, found to his surprise that diversity greatly decreases social trust and cooperation in America.</p>
<p>When racial differences don&rsquo;t lead to outright violence it is often because an authoritarian government like Tito&rsquo;s Yugoslavia uses tight police-state controls to keep conflict under wraps.  Once Yugoslavian government opened up though, it exploded into conflict and split into many different countries.  Now that each country is more homogeneous the Balkans are much more peaceful.</p>
<p>Finally as a rule, whenever there are different racial groups coexisting in a country there will be vast differences between groups in crime rates, education, income levels, cultural achievement, etc.  This usually produces strong political demand for racial preference laws in hiring, school admissions, mortgage approval, etc.  Thomas Sowell has written two excellent books on this subject, &#8220;Preferential Policies: An International Perspective&#8221; and &#8220;Affirmative Action Around the World&#8221;.  India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Nigeria, and South Africa just to name a few all have long had widespread racial preference laws and they don&rsquo;t appear to be going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>I wish it wasn&rsquo;t true but diversity really does lead to destruction.</p>

		<p>    Is Australia losing it&rsquo;s  collective mind. When the  indians get a toe hold then it&rsquo;s massive immigration and white disinfranchisement. Wake up blokes. There are 1.2 billion indians. There are only 20 million white australians.</p>

		<p><i>When racial differences don&rsquo;t lead to outright violence it is often because an authoritarian government like Tito&rsquo;s Yugoslavia uses tight police-state controls to keep conflict under wraps.</i></p>
<p>But these were people all of basically a single race - Southern European whites.</p>
<p>Sure if you have different ethnic groups thrown into the same society as such, and all identifying themselves as say Croatian, Serb, Muslim etc then there could be problems. And oftentimes race correlates with ethnicity, so what in fact are ethnic conflicts are blamed on race as well.</p>
<p>But are there many instances in the world where people hate each other purely for physical phenotypical differences? If we look at states like Turkey, where some people look almost pure Asiatic, while others look like Germans, but most (as far as I know) identifying themselves as Turks and Muslims, then these people of various racial phenotypes seem to get along well.</p>
<p>Of course they have a problem with Kurds - but that is an ethnic thing - not necessarily a racial thing.</p>
<p>People of different ethnicities have been slaughtering one another for centuries, but rarely over racial differences per se - but rather cultural, national, ethnic and religious reasons.</p>
<p><i>Jared Taylor in &ldquo;In Praise of Homogeneity&rdquo; detailed how much of the peace, social cohesion, and economic strength of Japan is due to racial and cultural homogeneity.</i></p>
<p>Robert Putnam, the liberal author of &ldquo;Bowling Alone&rdquo;, found to his surprise that diversity greatly decreases social trust and cooperation in America.</p>
<p>Both of these say nothing about racial diversity, but only cultural and linguistic diversity. I would guess a typical white American would probably trust a fully acculturated Hispanic sooner than say a new Russian immigrant with limited English.</p>
<p>The evidence is that multi-ethnic societies have problems - but because race often correlates with ethnicity - people think mutli-racial societies would have similar problems. But I think the jury is still out on that one.</p>

		<p>Is there naturally going to be less violence, less conflict, less hatred, where all the people are the same race?</p>
<p>Yes, there will be.  As homogeneous societies become more civilized violence drops.  Look at Japan or Scandinavia.  Amerindians, Europeans and east Asians have had very bloody histories.  But it is much easier to move past tribal conflict if the bulk of the population has a shared ethnicity, language and religion.  Would it end all crime and conflict - no- mankind has a very deeply ingrained nasty streak.  But it can be said with certainty that diversity adds to conflict.<br>

Europe went for centuries with only one race, more or less. Were things any less violent then? What about Asia or Africa? Is there naturally going to be less violence, less conflict, less hatred, where all the people are the same race?&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely, yes, and if you can&rsquo;t understand why and can&rsquo;t examine various societies and determine this to be true, I would say you had better take your blinders off and look at the real world, rather than the one you would like to see.</p>
<p>Trying to tell this board that not having blacks in our cities wouldn&rsquo;t make much difference in the larger scheme of things when they are but 6% of the population (black males) yet commit 58% of ALL violent crime is just a bit naive, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree?  </p>
<p>And what about society&rsquo;s constant placating them, because they can&rsquo;t learn and have to be cared for like children?  Dumbing down our schools so they can keep from falling too far behind is another problem that is far from insignificant.</p>
<p>I could go on, but the point is adequately made.  The amount of problems caused by multiculturalism is so insurmountable as to be an extremely dangerous factor that has placed Western societies on the brink of disaster constantly.</p>
<p>Claiming there were problems in homogeneous Europe in years past proves only that people have a certain number of problems everywhere.  Multiculturalism not only adds to those problems, they intensify them to the point where the existence of the nation state is put in constant jeopardy of exploding due to civil war.</p>
<p>Have you read no history at all?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Is there naturally going to be less violence, less conflict, less hatred, where all the people are the same race?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer would be yes. While civil wars or violent political movements that hurt or kill people have and do occur in racially homogeneous countries, most of the time, life is much more peaceful and stable in racially homogeneous countries. People are &#8220;tribal&#8221;, regardless of race and like it or not, identify much more with people that are of their race or group. Whenever you get people of different races together in large numbers, conflict or balkenization  occurs. One has different races forming communites and resenting each other and the majority, voting along racial lines and such. Take China, a country that is  racially homogeneous, excluding a small percentage of non-Chinese expats there with their jobs. Let&rsquo;s say China allowed mass immigration until the country was say 20% White and 20% Black. You&rsquo;d have instant balkenization as the Blacks wouldn&rsquo;t idetify with the Whites or Chinese, the Whites wouldn&rsquo;t identify with the Blacks or Chinese and each of these groups would be making demands of the Chinese and have resentment towards the majority Chinese and each other. The Chinese in return would resent and not identify with Whites or Blacks. Their would be less stability, much more tension and balkenization. It would make China much worse.</p>
