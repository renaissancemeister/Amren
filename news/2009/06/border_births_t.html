<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The ACLU says it is seeing a lot of cases like the one involving a Hispanic ex-Marine from California whose citizenship is suddenly being questioned.</p>
<p>Israel Betancourt of Lincoln, Calif., says he was born in Laredo, Texas, in 1977 with the assistance of a midwife, which the American Civil Liberties Union says has become a sticking point for U.S. passport officials seeking to verify an applicant&rsquo;s citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a lot of cases, these are folks who have been in the country and have considered themselves American their entire lives, and then suddenly the government is telling them they have suspicions about whether they are American citizens,&#8221; ACLU attorney Vanita Gupta told The Sacramento (Calif.) Bee.</p>
<p>Gupta said the midwife issue came into prominence recently as the federal government began requiring passports for airline passengers flying in from Mexico and Canada. The requirements began applying to land and sea travelers Monday.</p>

		<p>whether you were delivered by a midwife or in a hospital or in the back seat of a taxi by the driver, makes no difference. Your birth will still have been registered and there&rsquo;ll be a birth certificate somewhere to prove it.</p>
<p>If not then how has the above example been able to live as a citizen for the last 30 some years? If his illegal Mexican mother dropped him out on U.S soil and failed to register him in order to claim his birthright citizenship then he&rsquo;s missed the boat, tough luck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable with all the loopholes and other endless help these illegals recieve in this country some of them are still too dumb to make it.</p>
<p>Next thing you know the ACLU will be demanding citizenship for those born anywhere in the world because their parents once thought about coming to America but &#8220;through no fault of their own just never did it&#8221; and therefore they are entitled to citizenship.</p>

		<p>Hispanic ex-Marine from California whose citizenship is suddenly being questioned.</p>
<p>Personally, I would like to know more about this EX Marine! Even in &#8216;65 we had to produce a birth certificate to join the military or proof of legal residence.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Many people birthed by midwives can&rsquo;t prove they are citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, when is that a problem, except if the baby is white? </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still getting driver&rsquo;s licenses on flimsy I.D., while whites have to have a personal letter from the Pope. <br>

		<p>As one poster stated, all births in the U.S. have to be Registered somewhere.</p>
<p>If the baby was Baptised, then there also should be a Baptismal Record, with that person, or the Church he or she was Baptised in. A record of both parents, as well as Godparents would be on the Baptismal Certificate.</p>
<p>By the way, just how did his parents register him for School? Even Kindergarten Registartion requires a Birth Certificate.</p>
<p>An easy way to fix the problem is to require all Midwives to become Notary Publics, to verify, under Oath, the birth of all children, which they assist in the delivery. </p>
