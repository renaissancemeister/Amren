<h1>ACORN Drops Tarnished Name and Moves to Silence Critics</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Mooney, Washington Examiner, June 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Association of Community Organizers for Reform Now (ACORN) leaders are using the threat of a law suit to silence and intimidate critics, according to current and former members of the liberal activist group.</p>
<p>In a letter dated June 11 an attorney for ACORN advised top whistleblowers that their unauthorized use of the organization&rsquo;s name could make them liable for monetary damages and injunctive relief.</p>
<p> ACORN executives have also changed their organization&rsquo;s name, which was tarnished by investigations in at least 14 states of allegations of voter registration fraud during the 2008 presidential campaign, and charges by current and former members of financial mismanagement and misrepresentation.</p>
<p>The new name will let ACORN leaders continue their operations without worrying about prior bad publicity, according to Marcel Reid of ACORN 8, a group of present and former members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Wade Rathke, who founded the organization, announced on his blog that ACORN International has officially changed its name to &#8220;Community Organizations International.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid also said ACORN is in the process of dismantling Citizen&rsquo;s Consulting Inc. (CCI), a New-Orleans based non-profit, which has been used to maintain centralized financial control, ACORN 8 activists claim. Tax records show that CCI is interlinked with several ACORN affiliates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ACORN&rsquo;s national leaders withdrew a lawsuit Reid filed with fellow board member Karen Inman last October seeking access to internal financial records. Reid and Inman were also expelled from their board positions; a move they say was illegal. Reid and Inman then came together with six other colleagues to form ACORN 8.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arthur Schwartz, the general counsel for ACORN, has sent a &#8220;cease and desist&#8221; letter to Reid and Inman instructing them to discontinue using the name ACORN in a connection with their activities. This same letter threatens legal action if the ACORN 8 members do not provide written assurances that they will comply with this demand by the end of June.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reid told The Examiner that ACORN 8 will not comply.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no intention of not using the name ACORN 8, it is not a trademark infringement,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This get tough attitude is part of larger attempt to silence people and shut them down. We are not going to be silenced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ACORN&rsquo;s Project Vote affiliate has filed suit against Anita MonCrief, a former employee, who has testified under oath on voter registration allegations. ACORN is currently under investigation in at least 14 states for electoral irregularities. The Project Vote suit claims that Anita MonCrief and an unidentified accomplice gained access into private e-mails from group executives and stole the group&rsquo;s name without permission. It also accuses Moncrief of using a company credit card for her own purposes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ACORN 8 has released its own statement on &#8220;whistleblower retaliation&#8221; through its national spokesman Michael McCray that expresses support for new protective legislation.</p>

<p>Since the entire premise of this organization is to screw the white men &amp; women of this country, he should have finished the new moniker as such: Community Organizations International of The United States (abbreviated COITUS).</p>

		<p>Americans have got to wake up. It isn&rsquo;t enough for the intelligent posters on this forum to talk among each other and discuss the issues of the day. The &#8220;issues&#8221; are to serious for that. We have got to talk to our friends, family, relatives and anyone who will listen. We have got to do this until we are blue in the face from talking. Americans have the power, yes POWER, to do their own brainwashing for GOOD if we actually care about our nation and our friends and family. Why should we allow the Main Stream Government Media to allow our friends and family to be brainwashed with evil?</p>

		<p>ACORN is in big trouble in many different ways right now, and they&rsquo;re uynder investigation right now for their entire operation, which is probably in violation of the RICO statutes.</p>
<p>That this administration would hire them to take the census is just a further indication of the deterioration going on right now in this country.</p>
<p>As things continue to deteriorate to the point where we&rsquo;re in a severe depression and we are seeing job riots, tax riots, a shortage of food and scarcity of many other vital things, I&rsquo;m wondering if the messiah&rsquo;s white, hard core supporters will still support him.  </p>
<p>Although his approval and job ratings will likely be well below 50%, I&rsquo;m thinking his mind numbed robots will blame everything but him and his black associates for the fix they&rsquo;re in.</p>

		<p>By whatever names these extremist groups are known, they are basically citizen armies who do the president&rsquo;s bidding with virtually no oversight. Historical precedent can be found in the totalitarian regimes of various third-world nations. </p>
<p>We are on very dangerous ground right now. </p>

		<p>I will miss the ACORN name. It had a certain class to it. I wish the organization would disappear like the name.</p>

		<p>Greetings from Canada.  Leftist activists up here have started organizing under the ACORN banner.  </p>
<p>Canadian leftists are a strange bunch.  As much as they vociferously condemn the United States, they copycat the U.S., with particular eagerness to emmulate U.S. race politics.  These are the same Canadians who wore Obama t-shirts last year.  </p>

		<p>Eichmann, you&rsquo;ve hit on a good idea. We should call them COITUS from now on. Soon enough their new name will be as infamous as their old one.</p>
<p>And this is the group the Democrats are going to hire to take the census!</p>

		<p>From &#8220;Association of <b>Community Organizers</b> for Reform Now&#8221; to &ldquo;Community Organizations International.&rdquo;<br>
I must admit this is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen what the Acorn  acronym actually stood for.<br>
In the pre-coronation debates of last year when the apt critism of Hussien being under-qualified was raised, the response was that he was a &#8216;community organizer&rsquo;.<br>
Apparentally, as is everyone of their 500,000 members.<br>
Too late now.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s beyond incredible that our &#8220;president&#8221; would employ these criminals to conduct our national census.  Any questions I answer to these thuggish morons will be given with a gun conveniently and visibly at hand.</p>
