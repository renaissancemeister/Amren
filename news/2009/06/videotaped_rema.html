			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlie Savage, San Francisco Chronicle, June 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Judge Sonia Sotomayor once described herself as &#8220;a product of affirmative action&#8221; who was admitted to two Ivy League schools despite scoring lower on standardized tests than many classmates, which she attributed to &#8220;cultural biases&#8221; that are &#8220;built into testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those comments were among a trove of videos dating back nearly 25 years that shed new light on Sotomayor&rsquo;s views. She provided the videos to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week as it prepares for her Supreme Court confirmation hearing next month.</p>
<p>The clips include lengthy remarks about her experiences as an &#8220;affirmative action baby&#8221; whose lower test scores were overlooked by admissions committees at Princeton University and Yale Law School because, she said, she is Latino and had grown up in poor circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had gone through the traditional numbers route of those institutions, it would have been highly questionable if I would have been accepted,&#8221; she said on a panel of three female judges from New York who were discussing women in the judiciary. The video is dated &#8220;early 1990s&#8221; in Senate records.</p>
<p>Her comments came in the context of explaining why she thought it was &#8220;critical that we promote diversity&#8221; by appointing more women and minority judges, and they provoked objections among other panelists who pointed out that she graduated summa cum laude from Princeton and had been an editor on Yale&rsquo;s law journal.</p>
<p>But Sotomayor insisted that her test scores were subpar  &mdash;  &#8220;though not so far off the mark that I wasn&rsquo;t able to succeed at those institutions.&#8221; Her scores have not been made public.</p>
<p>&#8220;With my academic achievement in high school I was accepted rather readily at Princeton and equally as fast at Yale, but my test scores were not comparable to that of my classmates,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And that&rsquo;s been shown by statistics, there are reasons for that  &mdash;  there are cultural biases built into testing, and that was one of the motivations for the concept of affirmative action to try to balance out those effects.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Again with the complaining about cultural biases of standardized tests:</p>
<p>All that happened is that there was one verbal question on one SAT tests a number of years back about a yacht.  It involved knowing the typical parts of a yacht.  This is the &#8220;cultural bias&#8221; that the low IQ civil rights lobby has been whining about for years.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of a question on a St. Louis City Fire Department promotion test (not an entrance test for new FFers, but to promote a FF from one rank to another), that civil rights advocates called &#8220;culturally biased:&#8221;</p>
<p>You are 90 feet away from a fire.  All of your hoses are 30 feet long.  How many hoses must you hook together to reach the fire?</p>
<p>90 divided by 30 is culturally biased.</p>

		<p>Another excuse making minority. As for not making public her score, why not? Did she not say the tests were culturally biased? Prove it, SONIA! Everything about her should be made public and if she can&rsquo;t handle it, refuse your nomination, Sonia. How long do we put up with this nonsense of affirmative action in the first place? Don&rsquo;t they all claim &#8220;we are all equal&#8221; and &#8220;race is just a social construct&#8221;? Like any of us are fooled by their myths.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s unfit to hold any kind of high office.  This &#8220;cultural bias&#8221; excuse for low scorers has become so trite and overused it&rsquo;s really evolved to no more than a crybaby attempt to make excuses for scoring low anymore.  But, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.  America as we know it is finished.  It&rsquo;s beyond repair, and the system is going through its death throes right now.</p>
<p>6 years from now, everybody is going to wonder why so many people voted for this racist president who thinks America is all about keeping the bar too high for non-whites, failing to recognize that non-whites just can&rsquo;t jump high enough to reach it.</p>
<p>Democracy doesn&rsquo;t work so long as voices are given to people who are too naive and gullible to have a hand in making policy.  As soon as things are set straight, as in the 1700&rsquo;s, the hare-brains and do-gooders will be immediately at work tearing it all down as they&rsquo;ve done once again to another country.</p>

		<p>Well, I guess it has now come to the point that affirmative action candidates and recipients can openly brag about what got them ahead, as long as there&rsquo;s a phony &#8220;reason&#8221; attached as to why it&rsquo;s alright. This country is getting weirder every year.</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s been shown by statistics, there are reasons for that &mdash; there are cultural biases built into testing, and that was one of the motivations for the concept of affirmative action to try to balance out those effects.&rdquo;</i><p>How do hack mestiza mediocrities like Sotomayor get away with repeating this drivel about &#8220;cultural bias&#8221;?  There are no &#8220;statistics&#8221; showing &#8220;cultural bias&#8221; in the SAT and LSAT (unless knowing how to make sofrito or what a nickel-bag goes for in the &#8216;hood prepares you for a profession somehow).  prof. Arthur Jensen treated this issue long ago and definitively in his 1980 book &#8220;Bias in Mental Testing&#8221; (a 1999 peer-reviewed follow-up study published in School Psychology Quarterly concluded that &#8220;empirical research to date consistently finds that standardized cognitive tests are <b>not biased</b> in terms of predictive and construct validity&#8221; - my emphasis) - Sotomayor should be confronted with it and this statement at her Senate confirmation hearings.</p></p>

		<p>This is why non-white do so badly in the Hard sciences. No way that 2+2 =4 can have a cultural bias.And that is why many white nationalist tend to know the hard sciences very well. They can tell that  what appears to be an average low I.Q. for certain minorities means they have a low I.Q. As simple as 2+2=4.</p>

		<p>And exactly how does that explain the high performance of Asians on many of these tests? Are we supposed to believe that the tests are culturally biased in favor of Asian culture   &mdash;   even more so than White culture (as they tend to score better than Whites on math and science)?!?  </p>

<p>Obama and Sotomayor really evince the dangers of affirmative action. Both are rather unintelligent, but everyone thinks they are geniuses. The schools from which they graduated granted them phony honors as a sort of imprimatur so that no one would question their qualifications.  </p>

		<p>Americans are not going to get a better Supreme Court Justice out of Obama than this dull woman.  Sotomayor may be dumber than Thurgood Marshall and hence will be the dumbest Justice of all time.  </p>
<p>She is a woman and susceptible to a man&rsquo;s powers of persuading.  The intelligent males on the court happen to be all white males. May they can snooker her into voting against the anti-white-male position.</p>
<p>I say lay off her.  She can do no worse than her replacement and she is a bright shining light for how bad Affirmation Action is.<br>

		<p>Here is the mistake that this supposedly intelligent woman is making. The tests that she is talking about such as the SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) is a scholastic achievement test and not an intelligence test. If we were talking about an intelligence test we could, indeed, claim cultural bias. I could be very intelligence even though I may not know certain words.</p>
<p>However, a scholastic achievement test will test for vocabulary as does the SAT. You cannot claim cultural bias because you have a limited vocabulary. If you have a limited vocabulary you are not well read and you are not well educated.</p>
<p>So obviously this woman was not only poorly educated prior to her enrollment at these Ivy League schools, she was also unintelligent. She does not understand the difference between an intelligence test and a scholastic achievement test.</p>

		<p>Cultural Bias in this case means that the system/testing is too AMERICAN and should be changed to advance those who hate the traditional AMERICAN way and are too lazy and hate-filled to assimilate with AMERICAN culture.</p>

<p>Minority apologists incessantly claim tests are culturally and racially biased but they never give examples. </p>
<p>If any test is so biased, wouldn&rsquo;t it be to their advantage to point out the biased questions? If a question is proven to be biased, wouldn&rsquo;t it be easy to remove such questions and replace them with unbiased questions?</p>
<p>The reasons they don&rsquo;t give example of alleged biased questions are because tests aren&rsquo;t biased and alleged biased test is NOT the issue.</p>
<p>I was watching Chris Matthews interview the NAACP lawyer who argued before the Supreme Court that the New Haven fireman promotion test results should be rejected. Chris Matthews asked some very tough questions and he came out and asked, &#8216;what are the biased questions in question?&rsquo; The lawyer hemmed and hawed and gave a single example about a question that included knowing the difference between uptown and downtown. He said he couldn&rsquo;t give other examples because NO ONE HAD SEEN THE BEST BECAUSE THE TEST IS SEALED (and it&rsquo;s sealed because if we read the questions, it would be obvious to everyone there were no biased questions). BUT the lawyer made it clear that the issue wasn&rsquo;t about whether the test was biased at all. The question before the court was disparate outcomes and whether the city of New Haven had the right to disregard the test because no blacks passed the threshold. Whether the test was biased was irrelevant. Claiming the test is biased is only their way to get the test thrown out AND they have NO burden of proof to show the test was biased. Can you say win-win?</p>
<p>BTW, although Matthews asked tough questions, in the end, he sided with the NAACP lawyer and the city of New Haven to throw out the test and use other means for promotions.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure such tests are culturally biased, but I do think if a person with lower SAT scores can go on to Princeton and graduate summa cum laude (a distinction limited to the top 5% of the graduating class) and Phi Beta Kappa (a national honor society), then the value of such tests in predicting academic outcomes can be legitimately questioned.  </p>

		<p>Just like the Obamas were affirmative action smooth as silk silver tongue devils. Michelle Obama brags about it. Blacks average 600 on the SAT. Thats a zero since SAT scores give 300 per part under the old way before they added 3 parts with the writing in the past 3 yrs.</p>
<p>Law school is a favorite place for blacks in America since they can get in for free and get a degree but take yrs and 20 tries to pass the Bar but eventually succeed and lie their ass off with their whiplash or other court lies. </p>
<p>The place where you cant fake it is med school and pilot school. Very few blacks there since affirmative action steers clear of these knowing you cant fake your way flying commercial jets or performing surgeries.</p>

<p>That reminded me of the Democratic National Convention last year. Ted Kennedy gave one of the best political speeches of all time. Hillary gave a speech in a herky jerky manner. She kept pausing in mid speech before continuing - certainly seemed like she purposefully made he speech much less effective. Afterward everyone I talked to gushed about how great HIllary&rsquo;s speech was. </p>

<p>I saw William Ayers on TV a few days ago and he talked about &#8220;cultural bias&#8221; against blacks on standardized tests.</p>
<p>His example? One of the question had to do with a porch. Since blacks are less familiar with porchs than people in Iowa (his example) the test is flawed.</p>

		<p>like many minorities who get A&rsquo;s in high school and go on to College, Judge Sonia discounts her SAT or law school entrance exams. Texas even lets anyone in the top ten percent of a high school into the U of Texas system, regardless of standardized test scores.</p>
<p>Sounds fair? Judge Sonia. I&rsquo;ve been out of high school for over 40 years. Let me walk into your high school and take a few tests(not advanced algebra or calculus, I admit it, I suck at advanced math).  I will get A&rsquo;s. With no study. Wanna walk into my alma mater, the 450 year old distinguished Boston Latin School, which sends all of its graduates to college, including many to Ivies and near Ivies like Amherst and Seven Sisters,  and success(many are now Asian, used to be Jewish, Irish and WASP). Those kids will kick your butt, Judge Sonia. On the SAT, and before the SAT on class grades. They are not there because there daddy founded Fidelity; most are from poor or working class families. When&rsquo;s O&rsquo;bama(well, he&rsquo;s a friend of Ted Kennedy) gonna put a Chinese/Korean, Vietnamese judge on High Court?  After you stick your brilliant wife (affirmative action?) on the court, no doubt.</p>

		<p>ABSOLUTE INSANITY..but of a familiar left wing type. The curious<br>
may want to look up the Stalin era figure Trofim Lysenko who devised a school of agricultural genetics that were intended to<br>
promote above all a political agenda..ie. Communism. Lysenko rejected Mendelian genetics based on inheritance in favor of the idea that &#8220;environment&#8221; was the key to plant adaptation.<br>
Communism was built on the idea that everything,absolutely everything was a result of social structure and class. To win Stalins favor Lysenko extended this ideology into the plant realm. For Lysenko and his pals the result was high office, money, fame&hellip;at least for a time. Soon reality came knocking in the form of failed harvests, starvation, economic collapse.<br>

<p>Of course, nobody like Sotomayor is going to come out and say &#8220;I am an unqualified Affirmative Action political hack who was appointed only because I am a left-wing member of a dysfunctional ethnic minority&#8221;, but the rest of the US certainly knows the truth.</p>

		<p>The standard defense I trot out when confronted with the claim that IQ or other tests are culturally biassed is that, if this is so, then someone should be able to devise a test upon which blacks score higher. No one has, to date. How is this so?</p>

		<p>As I learned from the film; A Conversation About Race, many people claim to see &#8220;cultural Bias&#8221; in tests designed primarily by whites.<br>
Yet those same people can&rsquo;t explain how the Culturally Biased tests designed by whites, actually favor ASIANS&hellip;.?</p>

		<p>In the 70&rsquo;s, &#8220;culturally-fair&#8221; IQ tests were constructed and white kids still out-performed blacks on them. The g factor is real.</p>

		<p>The predictive validity of a test is the surefire way to determine the validity of an accusation of bias. If the tests are biased against blacks, then the tests would underpredict black academic performance. Indeed, the wealth of evidence on the subject actually shows the opposite; that the tests OVERPREDICT black academic performance (and this can be for any number of reasons). It is actually more reasonable to posit that most academic examinations are more biased against whites than they are against blacks.</p>
<p>Another funny thing about the Scholastic Aptitude Test is the great lengths the test makers went to rinsing out the &#8220;bias&#8221;. A brief glance at any of the &#8220;Critical Reading&#8221; passages confirms this; at least 60% of them are about minorities or women. Did this make any difference? Nope!</p>

		<p>&hellip;&#8221;she thought it was &ldquo;critical that we promote diversity&rdquo; </p>
<p>Hispanics are not interested in diversity.  Or they are only so far as it may enable them to become the majority in any situation.</p>
<p>My question is this;  When do we stop calling a groups a minority?  When they become 25% of the population, 49% of the population?  In any case, Whites are already a minority and have been for some time if we consider cultural and political power.</p>

		<p>If such tests are culturally biased, might it not also be the case that the work environment for the position applied for is culturally biased also? Perhaps the fire that needs to be fought is culturally biased, or the environment in which a person acts as a judge is a culturally biased situation.</p>
<p>If indeed both the test, and the position being applied for are both culturally biased, then lets consider </p>
<p>Sotomayer and some white male both are equally proficient at being a judge.</p>
<p>Sotomayer performs worse on the LSAT because the test is biased.</p>
<p>Sotomayer also makes decisions that have less justice than the white male in the real life courts even though she is just as good at it as the white male, because the system is biased against her.</p>
<p>So what is more important have equal opportunity for judges of equal ability, or having sound legal decisions?</p>
<p>Legal decisions affect so many people that it should trump the issue of career advancement, so if the above situation were true, the best thing to do would be to appoint the white male.<br>
What is more important, getting acurate legal opinions</p>

&#8216;Cultural bias&rsquo; in tests is an intellectually decrepit 40 year old criticism long dead and buried by people who design tests and validate them, </p>
<p>but though a dead horse, the anti American radical egalitarians beat it happily because that is all they know, </p>
<p>that they have learned in the culture of the leftist universities and hbcu&rsquo;s to explain differences in human accomplishment. Flat earther level of discussion. Voodoo germ theory.</p>
<p>The meme of radical egalitarianism and afromarxism and whitey get back, is the theme of the Obama era.</p>

		<p>Ultimately all of this obsession with who is bright and who is not will prove to be an errand to nowhere. We do live in a post-racial time in the sense that race in America is a dead issue. It does have great meaning to the people but no importance to the powers that be. The issue has been decided. The future will be multi-polar and we will get the short stick; China and other EastAsian nations will enjoy the better destiny. They have more mental assets than we do.<br>
I don&rsquo;t like thinking that but I cannot help it.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not sure such tests are culturally biased, but I do think if a person with lower SAT scores can go on to Princeton and graduate summa cum laude (a distinction limited to the top 5% of the graduating class) and Phi Beta Kappa (a national honor society), then the value of such tests in predicting academic outcomes can be legitimately questioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not necessarily.  Sotomayor is the exception rather than the rule.  Over half of all blacks are in the bottom 10% of their law school class.  At my law school, around 40% of the black students dropped out by the end of the first year.  I would also be interested if there was anonymous grading at Princeton.  Most law schools grade anonymously, but when I was in law school there was a big push to get rid of it.  Suprise, suprise - the push was spear-headed by the Black Law Students Association.  Gee, I wonder why.  Either way, it is still very easy for a liberal professor to find out whose papers are whose and give a few bonus points to their favored ethnic groups.<br>

		<p>It is clear that affirmative action is simply a grab for power by minorities who are unable to perform adequately on a level playing field. While the left claims to fight racism, it actually institutionalizes it. The ideal of equal outcomes has trumped the ideal of equal opportunity and merit. The goal of creating a society in which people are judged as individuals has been replaced by racial group politics. Just as the left is unable to provide any evidence of bias in SAT and LSAT tests, so also are they unable to provide any example of a successful nation that was racially diverse. Yet they would have us take it ON FAITH and against all evidence, that diversity is a wonderful blessing for our country.</p>

		<p>I am wondering when Caucasians, Orientals and Jews will be pressing for affirmative action in college and professional Basketball. Tryouts for the team could be labeled as culturally biased. After-all, think of some poor Asian kid that loves basketball but who has been deprived of the opportunity to play for hours and hours per day by controlling parents that demanded that that time be spent studying instead.</p>
