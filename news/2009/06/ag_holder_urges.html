<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-06-16-holder_N.htm">AG Holder Urges New Hate Crimes Law</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, June 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that recent killings show the need for a tougher U.S. hate crimes law to stop &#8220;violence masquerading as political activism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last several weeks, we have witnessed brazen acts of violence, committed in places that many would have considered unthinkable,&#8221; Holder told the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The violence, he said, &#8220;reminds us of the potential threat posed by violent extremists and the tragedy that ensues when reasoned discourse is replaced by armed confrontation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to stop that violence, he said, Congress should pass an updated version of hate crimes legislation, in order to more effectively prosecute those who commit violent attacks based on gender, disability, or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The growing number of hate crimes against Hispanics also shows the need for tougher laws, Holder said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier, a leading civil rights coalition says there has been an increase in white supremacist activity since the election of the first African-American president.</p>
<p>The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Education Fund reported Tuesday that the economic downturn and fear of immigrants also contributed to the increase.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, he admits that the Arkansas military recruiter being murdered was a hate crime.  Since this was a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, and the suspect hated the U.S. Armed Forces, perhaps Holder&rsquo;s Justice Department could press for hate crime charges.</p>

		<p>The only reason that hate crimes laws could possibly succeed in the U.S., is because we have so many ignorant people who are not informed about the issues and who DON&rsquo;T WANT TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THE ISSUES. Even those who often know the danger, will not send a simple fax or e-mail to their representatives and strongly state their disapproval. Millions of people protested the elections in Iraq and could have been shot or jailed. Americans, who enjoy all kinds of protected rights(for now) take it all lying down.</p>

		<p>I can guarantee that anything this man wants is based in his intention to help blacks some way even if it costs others their security or their futures.  He is the servent of the black.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this entire administration is all about, especially the blacks in it.  </p>
<p>As a community organizer, Obama was pre-occupied totally about ways to twist the system any way he could to favor blacks, which covered a period of at least one generation.  It was his ultimate goal, the one thing that occupied his mind night and day, 24/7.</p>
<p>So, after being elected savior, is he now supposed to somehow magically transform into an unbiased individual who loves his country and ALL the people in it, rejecting anything that might be favorable for, say, blacks, but of little or no benefit to anyone else?</p>
<p>He rejected placing his hand over his heart when the national anthem was played, and he failed to wear a flag pin, both because he didn&rsquo;t regard this country as his, nor did he think it was for blacks either.  His wife has more alienation for white America than he does.</p>
<p>National health care is for the benefit of blacks.  The so-called stimulus bill is no more than a spending program to benefit blacks.  </p>
<p>While he DOES administer to the necessities of office regarding international policy and other matters, he goes only through the motions and repeats what he has been told by his advisors.  Make no mistake about it.  His real and ONLY agenda is the promotion and betterment of blacks any way he can arrange it by hook or crook.</p>
<p>Turning this country into a nation where capitalists merge with government to create a fascist state is in line with creating a society where people who have little ability can achieve more.</p>
<p>I wonder who these underachievers are he has in mind?  If you ask the news media who now broadcast from his office, they will say it certainly isn&rsquo;t blacks.</p>

		<p>eric holder the racist, is aiming this law for selective prosecutions of whites, he has mentioned this even long before he was the AG. he is ate up with this mission, and is determined to get it passed. but there will be no prosecution of blacks for these crimes, they will not call it hate crimes, they will just call it crime. i feel sorry for any young white boy who has even a verbal disagreement with a black, because he will be charged with a hate crime. this will grow into speech also. these blacks will not be happy until all white people have to grovel to them and lick their boots, and wash their feet, and our white politicians are supporting this. durbin, kennedy. schumer. polosi, ried, frank, fienstien, biden, and all of the other democrats. they should be voted out of office immediately and when they come back to live amongst us, they should be shunned, and held in contempt.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The growing number of hate crimes against Hispanics also shows the need for tougher laws, Holder said.&#8221;  &mdash;  -Yes Mr. Holder, tell us all about the ubiquitous black home invasions of Hispanic households (households that are selected because they are either &#8220;under-served by the banking industry&#8221; or are into drug trafficking) that occur regularly across the nation. And while you are at it, don&rsquo;t be a coward and fail to talk about ethnic cleansing against Blacks in metro Los Angeles at the the hands of Mexicans and Central Americans.  Tell us all about your plans to consistently employ in your prosecutorial arsenal, &#8220;hate&#8221; enhancements of crimes against offenders of all races.</p>

		<p>To Bandmo at 7:15. Exactly right. Would truly enjoy seeing Holder deal with that! Now, if I understand the proposed legislation correctly, then in every single case before the court, both the application of the law and and the penalties, could be different every time and dependent upon the race, gender, national origin, etc., as well as the agenda, of ANY of the parties involved. It all sounds incredibly arbitrary and ripe for abuse. Sounds like legal chaos.   </p>

A senile, old man shoots a guard at a museum.</p>
<p>Now, as horrible as I think these all are I find it odd that these three rare incidents are a national crisis requiring emergency hate crimes legislation. After all, racist gangs of blacks and hispanics have engaged in all out extermination campaigns in California for a couple of years now.</p>

		<p>&#8220;when reasoned discourse is replaced by armed confrontation&#8221;.  The only reasoned discourse takes place on sites such as Amren.  It is not allowed in any of the mainstream media.  It is not allowed on television, radio, newspapers, schools, government publications or public gatherings of any kind.  Where is this &#8220;reasoned discourse&#8221; of which he speaks?  Except on the internet, I don&rsquo;t see it.  All I see is relentless promotion of &#8220;people of color&#8221;, mainly blacks, at the expense of whites and anti-white diatribes.  When reasoned discourse is not allowed, some hotheads will resort to violence.</p>

		<p>Murder and assault are already illegal.  You can already get a long jail sentence for these acts, including life in prison or execution for murder.  So just who to they think is going to be dissuaded from committing such an act just because there&rsquo;s a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; law?  The reality is that such laws are passed not to stop violent crime, but to make certain thoughts illegal.  </p>

<p>Shhh, keep that a secret.  Remember, the whole paranoid theory that Bush stole Florida from Gore in 2000 was based on a premise that a (&#8220;strategically&#8221;) parked police car two blocks from a polling place in a black neighborhood was a conspiracy to scare black men from voting.  If Holder&rsquo;s Just-Us Department find out that there&rsquo;s a uniformed cop at NYC polling places, they&rsquo;ll move in and call that &#8220;discriminatory.&#8221;  New York City is under the jurisdiction of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, amazingly.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not alone, I agree with you 100%.  He just made himself a martyr for the &#8220;whites are racist and must be displaced&#8221; crowd.

		<p>The hate crimes law is a 3-pronged legal weapon to be used against whites and only whites:</p>
<p>First, it is to stifle free speech whenever the elite feel like stifling it.  This has tremendous consequences. </p>
<p>Second, it is so that whites are sentenced more harshly if they ever intimidate or hurt a non-white, which is much more rare than the reverse, by the way.  Non-whites are being set up as untouchable sacred cows.</p>
<p>Third, it is so that whenever a white is beaten, all the minority has to say is that he was called the &#8220;n&#8221; word or some such slur and was so devastated that he couldn&rsquo;t help but beat the white person.  Of course, since no tape recorder was playing at the time, it will be hard to prove if this is true.  In the spirit of the times, the AA liberal judge will most likely rule in the favor of the poor, oppressed minority, dropping the charges against him, while charging the hateful white with hate speech.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems like we are living the novel of 1984.  Everything is leading up to taking all of our rights away.</p>

		<p>It is absurd for anyone to be punished more for victimizing someone because of race, religion, ethnic background, etc. It&rsquo;s no worse for a person to harm someone of another race for racial reasons than it is to harm anyone of any race for any reason. Of course, whites are the ones who get charged with hate crimes, even though minorities are the guilty parties more often than not.</p>

		<p>This is SO dangerous. Lefties are poised to nail what&rsquo;s left of our First Amendment to their wall(we lost freedom of association with Brown v. Board of Ed.). It will be their most cherished trophy. Wake up, everyone! If you throw a rock through a man&rsquo;s window because you don&rsquo;t like the color of his house, that is no less of a crime than if you throw a rock through his window because you don&rsquo;t like the color of his skin. The Left wants to punish thought, and it&rsquo;s no mystery whose thought will be targeted. We must resist codification of &#8220;thoughtcrime.&#8221; No person or group has a Constitutional right to be loved and wanted-certainly no group that leads the way in illiteracy, veneraeal disease and crime-and we have a right to dislike or hate anyone we choose to hate or dislike. We must insist on our right to free speech, or we&rsquo;ll lose it. db</p>
