<h1>Illegal Immigrants Charged With Forcing Minor Into Prostitution</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KHOU-TV (Houston), June 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three Mexican nationals have been indicted by a Houston grand jury on charges of conspiring to engage in sex trafficking of a minor, United States Attorney Tim Johnson announced Monday.</p>
<p>Jorge Texis-Montano, 24, Jorge Aguila-Cuapio, 19, and Sonia Tecuapacho, 24, are all Mexican Nationals in the United States illegally.</p>
<p>The defendants are accused of conspiracy to cause the minor victim, also a Mexican national, to engage in a commercial sex act. Each is expected to appear in federal court for arraignment on the charges this week although no date has yet been set.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A friend of the juvenile&rsquo;s mother contacted the Houston Police Department in April to report the 16-year-old girl was being held against her will, physically abused and forced to work as a prostitute at several different Houston area bars. The bars included El Guerrero located on the 6400 block of Wallisville Road.</p>
<p>The following day, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents joined the investigation to assist in locating the minor.</p>
<p>HPD officers found her on May 4 at an apartment complex on Broadway Street in Houston. ICE and FBI agents assisted with the investigation that ultimately led to the filing of criminal charges against all three defendants.</p>

		<p>There literally isn&rsquo;t a SINGLE reason that makes illegal immigration good for the general American public. Document fraud, child molestation, theft, robbery, rape, prostitution, welfare fraud, and other forms of lying, cheating and stealing. Of course not all of the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; do these things. But the fact that illegal aliens are not monitored in any way, whether fingerprints, records from Mexico(that&rsquo;s a joke) or any legitimate identification, makes American citizens sitting ducks to every conceivable crime in the book. It is truly strange, that Americans take it all  &mdash;  in general, lying down, not a peep, not a sound. How many times have we been told that democracy implies, no, demands responsiblilty from the citizenry?</p>

		<p>This does not surprise me in the least.  What we have are lawless people from lawless countries coming here to perform their lawless deeds.  What else do you expect?</p>

		<p>I bet the Mexicans and other southerners don&rsquo;t have a big problem with Identity theft! nor do they hear about a long lost, now dead, relative leaving them money in Nigeria.</p>

		<p>I had info on the same thing going on in my town here in the Northwest and meth was part of the whole scene too.  It was a group of young Hispanic adults.  The man involved was on parole and his girlfriend was pimping at least one underage girl, but maybe more.  I was told there were more.  We in the neighborhood (I have moved since) tried to get the police into the situation, but they seemed to hang back, allowing things to go on.  We could only guess that they were hoping to grab suppliers, etc.  But we couldn&rsquo;t offer proof on the pimping, so they couldn&rsquo;t act.  Police did show up at their apartment a few times, but they seemed to remain there anyway.</p>
