<h1><a href="https://www.livescience.com/culture/090604-white-men-pay.html">Why White Men Get Paid More</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>LiveScience, June 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite advances in parity in recent decades, white men in America on average still get paid more than women and minorities for doing the same work, by some accounts about 20 to 25 percent more.</p>
<p>A new study finds one reason: In satisfaction surveys, store customers and medical patients say they prefer white men, and managers frequently hire and set pay based on customer preferences.</p>
<p>In the study, researchers at four business schools showed study subjects a video featuring either a black male, a white female, or a white male actor playing the role of an employee helping a customer. Those viewing the white male were 19 percent more satisfied with the employee&rsquo;s performance, and they were also more satisfied with the store&rsquo;s cleanliness and appearance.</p>
<p>But the actors demonstrated the same scripted behaviors, and the store background, camera angles and lighting were identical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Customers, from students buying textbooks to patients in an examining room, are consistently biased in favor of white men,&#8221; said David Hekman, assistant business professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. &#8220;Because customer satisfaction is critical for organizational survival, business owners and managers will hire white men when possible and will pay lower salaries to the women and minorities they do hire.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a separate aspect of the study, Hekman and his colleagues examined more than 10,000 medical patients&rsquo; ratings of their doctors. Patients who received e-mail from their doctor were more satisfied with their doctor&rsquo;s competence and approachability, but only if the doctor was a white man.</p>
<p>Changes are needed in how customer satisfaction surveys are conducted, Hekman argues.</p>
<p>Surveys should target specific employee behaviors. For example, don&rsquo;t ask customers if they would recommend a physician, he suggests. Ask them how many times the doctor asked a patient if she had additional questions or understood key medical terms.</p>
<p>Anonymous customer feedback surveys should not be done, Hekman said. Customers should be identifiable and therefore at least somewhat accountable for their ratings. &#8220;People may do all sorts of bad things when they are anonymous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just check out the reader postings on any blog.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study, announced today, will be published in the Academy of Management Journal.<br>

		<p>All else being equal, I prefer white men as well.  Especially when it comes to physicians, attorneys and other skilled professions.  The reason?  I know they didn&rsquo;t get where they are due to affirmative action.  </p>
<p>Now the leftists out there are screaming &#8220;but they might have gotten there through the good ole boys network!&#8221;  Yes.  It&rsquo;s possible - but there are no quotas of &#8220;good ole boys&#8221; who must be admitted or graduated from schools.  Furthermore, blacks and women can also be members of &#8220;good ole boys&#8221; networks.  Also, there is no doubt that affirmative action is far more pervasive than good ole boys networks.  AA is entrenched and embedded in all large American institutions, public or private.</p>

		<p>Take this simple test.<br>
1. Go into Home Depot, Lowes or any store where the help hss to have some knowledge of the store, the merchandise and problems customers might ask about a product etc.<br>
1. Go to the section with black help. Ask a pertinent question..ie go to the electrical section and ask the black man<br>
there about a switch, a electrical code, a tool. You will simply get no help or the automatic referral of the question to someone else.<br>
2. Try the same thing with white help. You will get an answer from someone who knows something about the store and its products and who feels some responsibility toward the customer.<br>
3. Ask the black help how long he has been working at the store, aske the white person. Notice that no matter how long the black has been working there..he has show zero interest in learning anything about the job.</p>

		<p>Beleive me, the last people here the USA that want everybody treated &#8220;equal&#8221; are the blacks and females&hellip;.Sports for example, women in things like the &#8220;Boston Marathon&#8221;, they get a half hour head start over the men and when they come in ahead (barely) of the men they say &#8220;See we told you we could do it, we are just the same as the men&#8221;, Golf, Billiards, Tennis, Basketball, ECT. The Military, if a man only does the &#8220;PFTs&#8221; the same as the best female he would be kicked out, but ther female will be E-7 in 6 years, and on and on, I saw this in real life. And as for blacks, without &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; they would be crying even more.</p>

<p>See how sick liberal/leftist are? This crank wants to change the survey to give him the results he wants. This goes hand in hand with liberals habit of changing the names of things to try and give them a new meaning. Liberalism/leftism is a mental disease.<br>

		<p>Just today, I was making an appointment to see a doctor at an orthopedic clinic. I called three clinics. The phones were answered at clinic 1, by a dumb sounding white woman, at clinic 2 by a dumb sounding black woman, and at clinic 3, by an articulate white woman. I am keeping my appoinment at clinic 3. To me, their choice of receptionist indicates their overall professionalism and by extension, competence.</p>
<p>In my experience, white women and white men are equally competent in business and the professions. I never volunteer to be the guinea pig for Affirmative Action Jackson in any setting.</p>

		<p><i>Customers, from students buying textbooks to patients in an examining room, are consistently biased in favor of white men</i></p>
<p>If this is the case, why is the new national obsession in both print and TV ads to show non-whites, particularly blacks, as often as possible?</p>
<p>The computer magazine I got in the mail today shows an Asian girl on the front cover depicted as a computer &#8220;genius.&#8221; Inside, and ad for an ISP with tech support you can trust shows a white guy, girl, and a black man front and center. Another ad shows a black professional artist, and other ads I&rsquo;ve seen have shown black business professionals. (Virtually all of the writers for this magazine, however, are white.)</p>
<p>Advertisers are either clueless, this study is fallacious, or advertisers have a death wish. Take your pick.</p>

<p>How laughable and obvious there Comrade Hekman; you didn&rsquo;t get the multicultural &ldquo;results&rdquo; you wanted, so demand built-in biased test reporting from research subjects in the future. That is what this all amounts to and nothing more.</p>
<p>If telling the truth in an uninhibited manner is what you consider &ldquo;all sorts of bad things,&rdquo; maybe you should quit being a researcher and go work for the Cuban or North Korean secret police.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>As far as gender goes, this has been done to death and proven that the wage gap really doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t look at what someone earns over a lifetime.  You have to break it down by hour, and take into account what job they&rsquo;re doing.  Then look at who&rsquo;s claiming worker&rsquo;s comp, disability, etc.</p>

<p>In other words: We should punish people for telling the truth.   </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s criticizing the internet for its best feature: it&rsquo;s the ONLY place where ordinary folks like me are able to voice an opinion about racial matters w/o being &#8220;held accountable,&#8221; which is to say, punished for saying the wrong thing.  <br>

		<p>Gotta &#8220;love&#8221; those recommendations of how to fix the &#8220;problem&#8221;. <br>
Folks, this is how our last freedom   &mdash;  - the freedom to discriminate (in the positive sense) in our private decisions   &mdash;  - can be taken away from us. I suppose eventually we&rsquo;ll have suggestions for election ballots to be non-secret, to shame political troglodytes into conforming. (But don&rsquo;t even think of challenging anyone foreign-looking or -sounding   &mdash;  - or even just anyone   &mdash;  - to produce proof of their eligibility to vote!).<br>
  Today&rsquo;s militant &#8220;progressives&#8221; want to destroy our nation (and other Western countries) by reducing their cosmopolitan, statist and anti-White wordview to formal catechisms or rulebooks. The purpose is to expunge any un-verbalized, &#8220;gut&#8221; or intuitive responses or prejudices that might insinuate unapproved loyalties past the PC police. (A small corrolary is that we can never win any war or manage crime when soldiers and policemen need to consult rulebooks before shooting).<br>
  As Jared Taylor points out, such prejudices were never formalized in our founding documents because so self-evident at the time; but the destroyers of America are bound and determined not to repeat that mistake in THEIR founding documents for our soon-to-be tyranny.</p>

And those anonymous questionnaires:  no more of that!  Get their names and hold them accountable. Find out who they are. They will have to be sent to customer sensitivity sessions in order  to correct their unprogressive attitudes. </b></p>

<p>Hasn&rsquo;t anyone besides me noticed that there is no good ol&rsquo; boys network anymore?  Has anyone else besides me also noticed that there are networks with admission and cover-ups for women and racial/ethnic groups now everywhere.  I really notice it everytime I deal with my local community college which is run by feminists.</p>
<p>But its everywhere.  I had a poor White couple as patients some years ago.  They told me about how they tried to get work picking apples in Eastern Washington.  &#8220;Not qualified,&#8221; they were told - by the Mexican foreman managing a monolingual Mexican crew of farm workers.  They couldn&rsquo;t get work picking fruit anywhere.  Whites need not apply.</p>

		<p>The view of that Hekman fellow is not funny, but openly totalitarian. The most basic principle of democracy, of elections and ballots is that the voter must never, never be identifiable or accountable. That is the only guarantee that he can decide without fear of retaliation and repression. A customer satisfaction survey is nothing but a small-scale ballot in a limited field. If we abolish voters&rsquo; anonymity there, it will one day end in the abolition of democracy. The voter-bashing in the liberal media after the elections for the European parlament gives us a foretaste.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m no feminist, but I think women might even be better for some jobs. I actually have a little bit more gut level trust for female physicians in making accurate diagnoses based on careful examination instead of making a snap judgment and sticking to it even if it&rsquo;s wrong (which men sometimes do). </p>

		<p>I own a well known and successful preschool in a major metropolitan center that is majority minority, and while many similar businesses have been closing down due to lack of business  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m thriving, and actually hiring more teachers to handle all the new demand. </p>
<p>The difference? I&rsquo;m the only facility in the area who employs all white staff, consequently I provide the highest quality service, and already the upper middle class and wealthy clientele will wait- sometimes years (in the case of a newborn) on my list for entry into my program, now I&rsquo;m being offered premiums above my stated tuition for entry ahead of the waiting list. </p>
<p>I think the Greater Depression will be the death of minority owned or run business, in the new competitive environment, the few customers that are left will be looking for the best quality of whatever they want to purchase. Not all whites will provide the best product or service, but the best product or service is always going to be provided by whites.    </p>

This goes to a more fundamental point about freedom and totalitarianism. Thugs like this Hekman fellow don&rsquo;t believe that money should be earned through voluntary transactions. They believe that money should be distributed by the state because only the state knows whats &#8220;fair&#8221; and can protect us from our evil racist subconscious. I hope more people &#8220;Vote with their money&#8221; like you do while we still can!</p>

		<p>A Norwegian male was here, ten minutes ago.  He fixed my computer&rsquo;s issues quickly and competently.  He always does.  His (white) wife, on the other hand, never knows ANYTHING.  Any question requiring competency goes to the WHITE MAN, or his two white male assistants.</p>
<p>A white male handles the wiring issues in my 1965 &#8220;Fine Brick Dream Home&#8221;, quickly and competently.</p>
<p>There was an issue with my &#8220;communications provider&#8221;.  Three black women and one black male were not sufficient to resolve an incredibly simple issue (basically a &#8216;connect&rsquo;).  Only when I reached a white male somewhere in New Jersey was the &#8216;problem&rsquo; (instantly) resolved.  &#8220;There&rsquo;s no problem.  They just didn&rsquo;t enter this as a connect.&#8221;  And with that, he was off to undo some other &#8216;representative&rsquo;s incompetence.</p>
<p>My classic limousine liberal (former) boss once let it slip that he always hangs up when a black voice answers directory assistance.  &#8220;They never, ever, find what you want.  They tell you there&rsquo;s &#8216;no listing&rsquo;.  I can call right back and get a white person, and there will be a listing.  So I just hang up the instant I hear a black voice.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is how things work in the real world.  Woe be unto us, when, in the very near future, there will not be enough white males to go around.  Things will not get fixed.  Everything will fall apart.</p>
<p>The white males used in the studies probably WERE more competent: not specific to the scripted material, but in general.  The people whose perceptions were being tested probably perceived correctly the general level of competence of the white males.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smarter than most men.  But I&rsquo;m not as smart as my brothers.  Their intelligence probably IS about five points higher than mine.  They instantly grasp complex things that take me an hour or so to unravel.  We all worked our way up in the world.  One brother is an Attorney, and one is a surgeon.  I did not make it quite as far.  But that&rsquo;s fine.  The hour&rsquo;s delay I mentioned surely would be a hindrance during complex restructuring, or when strategizing a particularly challenging surgery.</p>
<p>At whatever level of competence, be it Plumber or Neurosurgeon, the white males more often &#8216;get it&rsquo; instantly.  We&rsquo;ve all seen it, and so our collective perception of white males&rsquo; superior competence is accurate&hellip;.tests or no tests.</p>

		<p>I looked at the link for this Heckman guy posted above. He&rsquo;s nothing but a shallow opportunist. Another young, white male academic trying to save his own hide in academia by joining the anti-white male &#8216;research&rsquo; cult. Here&rsquo;s a quote from his homepage:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;but my co-authors and I finally figured it out.  The reason is that managers really want to give customers what they want and customers irrationally prefer white men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note the triumphant, authoritative tone in what is a statement not of fact but of what he and his co-workers wish were the case and conjecture about the mental fitness of customer bases of businesses of which none of the authors have any direct involvement. </p>

		<p>By condemning anonymous surveys, what Hekman is really saying is that customers should be subject to retaliation by the incompetant Affirmative Action hires they criticize.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also technically incorrect when he complains that women are paid less than men.  My understanding is that in most fields, women are paid as much as men - right up to the point when they leave the work force to have children.  This time away from work is what costs them, not &#8220;sexism&#8221;.</p>

What is so utterly incredible is that many of these so called progressives, are highly educated, and yet, still ignore things so obvioius, that in doing so,they only damage their own credibility. The left is for the environment, yet unlimited immigration and rejection of the nation state. They say they are for a decent quality of life for people, yet their policies overtax people and ruin whole States like California. They are for going easy on criminals, yet do everything they can to encourage further criminality.</p>

		<p>What gets me about these sorts of studies is that you get these geeky social scientists trying to quantify the labor values of millions of people.  How do they get the data?  And how do they analyze the data?  On top of that, most social scientists live in the cloistered world of academia with little sense of how the real world works.  What is the worth of Plumber A versus Plumber B?  Or Carpenter X and Carpenter Y?  Who is the better ballplayer, home run hitter Manny Ramirez who is a lousy fielder and a cancerous presence in the clubhouse or second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who is a slick fielder who hits .320 with fair power?</p>

<p>Given affirmative action promotions, just like the &#8216;quick rank&rsquo; in the Army, I&rsquo;d have to say women working the exact same job earn more. There is no real data here however. Just the stereo-type that men on average earn more. And that women have to work twice as hard to achieve the same recognition. Men earn One dollar for every 50 cents earned by women or something. The reality is women study different subjects, go into different job fields, work a different length of hours, and have been on the job a different length of time than have men.</p>
<p>Why not play the race card as well as the sex card? Black women earn more money than black men. We won&rsquo;t be hearing about it as &#8216;75 cents for every dollar&rsquo; earned by black women, no doubt.</p>

<p>These claims of male ability to get the job done better are just not true. </p>
<p>On average, it&rsquo;s usually too close to call. And it&rsquo;s hardly true that all non-whites employees are useless.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a real problem when women and non-whites arrogantly think they&rsquo;re <i>better</i> because they&rsquo;re women and non-whites, and begin to behave thusly, behavior which is difficult to change as it often arises because they&rsquo;ve erroneously come to believe they&rsquo;re beyond reproach.</p>

     This poster is correct in her analysis, however I am shocked that the &#8220;diversity police&#8221; have not yet attacked him/her. How can an organization like this be allowed to operate efficiently? All over the country we have businesses and organizations which have to hew to some quota system, even if only motivated by fear of being sued for discrimination. I know the poster is anonymous, but I would love to find out if he/she rejects certain applicants either as teachers or as students. As for myself, I believe that a private, non-governmental organization should be allowed to discriminate in any way that furthers its purposes and profits. And as to governmental organizations, which are vulnerable to quotas, I think the taxpayers should be getting good value for their taxes and &#8220;diversity&#8221; should take a back seat to efficiency. </p>

		<p>The lowest on the totem pole are the staff at the supermarkets, all ethnic - what do you expect for $6 an hour.They seem to delight in changing the location of anything and everything once you have remembered where it is. When I go shopping, I need this, that and the other and nothing else. I went in a few weeks ago, I needed sugar and they had moved it again, I asked a clerk who proudly told me it was in the grocery section. At a recent check out, my bill came to $17.32, handed her a $20, then found 32 cents, offered it to to her, she refused to take it, she said she could not as she had already punched it in and she had to give me $2.68 change. I tried to explain to no avail, she offered to call the supervisor to cancel the transaction and I gave up.</p>
<p>My local home depot is still almost all white, I suspect many are retired tradesmen because the know what they are talking about.</p>

&#8220;I&rsquo;m no feminist, but I think women might even be better for some jobs. I actually have a little bit more gut level trust for female physicians in making accurate diagnoses based on careful examination instead of making a snap judgment and sticking to it even if it&rsquo;s wrong (which men sometimes do). &#8220;</p>
<p>I had a 25 year career as a doctor and I notice women do this at least as often as men.  It is especially prevalent in young women these days.  They grew up being told that they can do anything are superior to men, etc., and they believe it.  They are assertive and even agressive about this assertiveness in a way most men (today) would not dare to be - professionally.  Men are under the gun as potential lawsuit victims for all sorts of misconduct while females have little of that sort of pressure applied to them from the start.  The result is over-confidence and a very assertive attitude.  Many seem to take lessons in professional conduct from tv shows as well.  I found it all so irritating and dangerous after I returned from practicing in Europe that I choose to retire poor than work in these atmospheres any longer.</p>
