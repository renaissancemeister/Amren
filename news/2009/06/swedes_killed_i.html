			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local (Färögatan, Sweden), May 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Several young men who left Sweden to join the radical Islamic militant group al-Shabaab in Somalia have been killed in battle, according to Sweden&rsquo;s security service Säpo.</p>
<p>Säpo estimates that about 20 people have left Sweden to train and fight with al-Shabaab, a militant group with alleged ties to al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>So far, a handful of people with Swedish passports have also been killed in the fighting, Säpo reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the time being, it is believed there are ten or so Swedes on the ground in Somalia. They are either taking part in the violence or in training camps, but there may be more as of yet unknown cases. What worries us is that it&rsquo;s ongoing and growing,&#8221; said Säpo counterterrorism analyst Malena Rembe to the Svenska Dagbladet (SvD) newspaper.</p>
<p>The recruits aren&rsquo;t only Swedes with Somali backgrounds, but are also individuals of mixed ethnicity, according to Rembe.</p>
<p>Some of them are leaving Sweden without telling their relatives what they are planning to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are people who are going down on their own initiative. They see themselves as a part of a global struggle and want to contribute,&#8221; said Rembe.</p>
<p>Somalia has been at war since 1991 when the country&rsquo;s government collapsed. Recently, al-Shabaab militants have made advances toward the Somali capital of Mogadishu.</p>

<p>These people are African right now, no matter if they lived in Sweden for 400 years.</p>
<p>The sick people want us all to think like they do.</p>
<p>Too bad they didn&rsquo;t pursue their jihad in Sweden, so the PC mental cases could get full benefit of their newly acquired third world rabble.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Somalia has been at war since 1991 when the country&rsquo;s government collapsed.&#8221;</p>
<p>How does a government &#8216;collapse&rsquo;? Did the people simply begin to disregard the government, or did they arm themselves against it? Or does big money, or do big government &#8216;one world government&rsquo; types, have an interest in the appearance of &#8216;collapse&rsquo; in Somalia?  </p>

		<p>&#8220;How does a government &lsquo;collapse&rsquo;?&#8221;</p>
<p>That can happen in many ways. Rome and China have collapsed before, and they were nations much stronger than Somalia. In this case, democracy was destroyed after a military takeover. In Somalia&rsquo;s case, its warlordism that caused the Government&rsquo;s downfall. Generals and militias began to ignore orders, and now Somalia is in reality three states: Puntland, Somaliland and Somalia. The former two are actually doing quite well; no extremism and good economic growth and existence of the rule of law (and even the restoration of democracy). Unfortunately, Somalia hasn&rsquo;t had the talent or ability to follow the footsteps of its unrecognised, but superior neighbours. We can only hope they can work something out soon.</p>

		<p>Of course, the whole &#8216;asylum&rsquo; racket, (that is destroying western Europe), is predicated on the &#8216;fact&rsquo; that the asylee &#8216;must&rsquo; be according protection in a safe nation, (ie a high welfare-state spending White nation), because, supposedly, his life is perilously threatened in his homeland.<br>
  - I just wish more people would wake up and see the &#8216;asylum&rsquo; racket for the damned lie that it is.</p>

		<p>In Europe today, the authorities train recent immigrants to say &#8220;I come from Sweden&#8221; instead of &#8220;I come from Somalia,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>I have lived in Europe for 15 years, and I say proudly: &#8220;I come from Boston Massachusetts,&#8221; like any sane person would.</p>
<p>I am forever meeting 3rd world immigrants here who tell me earnestly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I come Germany&#8221; (they cannot say &#8220;I come from Germany,&#8221; their knowledge of Germany is far too primitive. Some continue to speak pidgin German after 25 years of living here, because the authorities may teach them to speak gibberish about their origins, but no one can manage to teach them 3rd grade German.)</p>
<p>These poor, confused creatures are far too dim to think up such a fantastic idea, they know perfectly well that they come from Kenya or Pakistan, some PC government official has apparently brainwashed them.</p>
<p>All of the Europeans I know regard the practice as bizarre, insane, ludicrous.</p>
<p>All Europeans define themselves by nationality, region, home town, etc. Many treasure their local dialects, customs, diet, etc.</p>
<p>Over here, there is no melting pot:<br>
Here, a Scotsman saying he is &#8220;Swedish&#8221; because he has lived in Sweden for 50 years is simply a LIAR. </p>
<p>A Somalian saying it 2 weeks after arrival is shrugged off as just plain old crazy PC gibberish. </p>

		<p>How can Africans be called Swedes? How can Africans be called British? The same with Asians, Pakis, Hispanics, etc&hellip;How can any other race, besides White, be called a European? </p>
<p> I apply this to America also. How can any African be called an American? How can any Asian be called an American, etc. etc? They most certainly were not when this nation was formed, so why do we call them Americans now?  Because of the traitors who allowed them into our country and THEN made them citizens.</p>
<p> We all know that America was built and formed for the progeny of our race, so why do we pretend otherwise?  Why is everyone so afraid to stand up and say this as fact?</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re missing the whole point of this story.  There is no analogy here.</p>
<p>Yes, immigrants from places like Germany and Ireland fought in America&rsquo;s Civil War (many because they were drafted into it).  </p>
<p>But these  are fighters of Somali descent, RETURNING TO their families&rsquo; homeland.  They are not immigrants to Somalia,  and presumably they are there as volunteers.   No comparison! <br>
