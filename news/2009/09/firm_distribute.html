			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Kraft, Los Angeles Times, September 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Selena Cuffe sampled South African wines four years ago in Soweto, she didn&rsquo;t wax poetic about their rustic radiance, about plum and berry notes on the nose or hints of vanilla on the palate. That would come with time.</p>
<p>What swept her off her feet were the stories behind the labels: black winemakers struggling to survive, post-apartheid, in an industry dominated by whites and in a market suspicious of new players.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like a bright light went off in my head,&#8221; said Cuffe, a high-energy 33-year-old with a Harvard MBA, marketing experience at Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and a desire, as an African American, to give a hand to black entrepreneurs in South Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A month later, in October 2005, they launched Heritage Link Brands, the only U.S. company dedicated to importing and distributing wines produced by black South Africans.</p>
<p>They invested $70,000, most of it from savings, and borrowed the rest against their credit cards, at promotional rates. One of their first major decisions was to put the headquarters in Los Angeles, Selena&rsquo;s hometown.</p>
<p>Today, wines imported by Heritage Link are sold at 835 restaurants, retailers and grocery stores, including Albertsons in Southern California, and are being poured in the business and first-class cabins of United Airlines and, soon, American Airlines. Total revenue rose to more than $1 million last year from a little less than $100,000 in 2007, and it&rsquo;s up 50% this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our objective has always been to make the wines and the stories behind them household names,&#8221; said Selena, the company president, &#8220;and to change people&rsquo;s perceptions of Africa by exposing them to all that&rsquo;s beautiful coming from the continent.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Seven Sisters wines, for example, are produced by sisters who, during apartheid, were evicted from their home in a small fishing village on the western coast of South Africa. They returned 22 years later and now produce seven wines, each named for one of the sisters.</p>
<p>The Bouwland Cabernet Sauvignon-merlot blend comes from a winery that is owned and run by a group of farmworkers who banded together after apartheid and, with the help of a white winemaker, bought a prime 140-acre vineyard near Stellenbosch.</p>
<p>The M&rsquo;hudi wines come from another Stellenbosch vineyard  &mdash;  the only black, family-owned vineyard in South Africa. Diale Rangaka, a former English professor, and his wife, Malmsey, a clinical psychologist, had long dreamed of owning a farm, but it wasn&rsquo;t possible under apartheid. They bought the property in 2003 and moved there from Soweto.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a research project for a would-be Heritage competitor last spring, UC Davis students concluded that American consumers weren&rsquo;t willing to pay extra for wines produced by blacks in South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s a niche market, but it&rsquo;s not sufficient to sell very much wine at a premium,&#8221; said their professor, Robert Smiley, who is director of wine industry studies in the graduate management school. &#8220;By and large, the wine has to stand on its own two feet as far as quality goes. If it&rsquo;s good and priced right, it will sell.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the company has grown, Selena&rsquo;s view of who qualifies as a partner in South Africa has changed. At first, she wanted to represent only wines made by operations owned and run by black South Africans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hung up on the idea of making sure that everyone involved was black, because this is a $3-billion industry in South Africa and less than 2% of it is owned by the black majority population,&#8221; Selena recalled. &#8220;But that was silly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Color, she added, doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as the wine maker is creating wealth for the black majority. &#8220;I want to do business with people whose hearts are in the right place,&#8221; she said.<br>

		<p>Something tells me she wouldn&rsquo;t be saying &#8220;color doesn&rsquo;t matter&#8221; if she had more than 3 or 4 actual black wine producers to choose from.</p>
<p>But what would be the response if she had said it didn&rsquo;t matter as long as money went to help the minority white community?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m very discriminate in what brands I drink, preferring French and some California wines.  I would no sooner drink a South African import than I would buy strawberries with a &#8220;product of Mexico&#8221; label on them.  Mrs Cuffe could probably make more money importing a South African ripple and selling in Korean grocery stores throughout the hood.</p>

		<p>This angers me greatly.  Who developed the hybrid of grapes used to make the wine?  Certainly not black Africans. The wine-making process was taught to them by Europeans. Poor Moldova in Eastern Europe makes some of the best wine in the world and highly depends upon its sales to aid their struggling economy. Are all Whites rushing to support their wine industry just because Moldova wineries are owned and operated by Whites?</p>

		<p>Now you&rsquo;ve piqued my interest. How do you say &#8220;ripple&#8221; in Afrikaans? Once South Africa has reached the same state as Zimbabwe and the whites who know how to produce the wine have been run off, let&rsquo;s see how well this industry holds up.  </p>
<p>With Apartheid, the SA government was creating wealth for the entire populace. </p>

		<p>The L.A.Times is delivered to my place of employment every morning. I would never spend a nickel on it - thank God the paper is dying an agonizing death as whites are running away from it in droves. I thumb through this birdcage liner every day, just to see the unending stream of propaganda put forth by the red-diaper grandkids. In the case of this story, it wasn&rsquo;t the pictures that caught my eye. The first thing that jumped out at me was the headline, more so than usual. After all, change the word &#8220;Black&#8221; to &#8220;White&#8221; and think about what kind of Hell would be raised if an article were run about whites importing wine from proud whites. </p>

		<p>I must be missing something here.  I thought we already had a number of celebrated wines enjoyed by blacks in a gesture of solidarity.  Night Train, Jive Seven, Hombre, and Ripple come immediately to mind.  I&rsquo;m sure there are many others.</p>

		<p>Those wine connossieurs throw around so many subtle flavors that wines seem to possess&hellip;&hellip;.here is a sample of what I would expect in a wine review, since they are playing up the &#8216;Black&rsquo; angle of these wines&hellip;&hellip;.on the rim: shades of Indian ink and used motor oil; on the palate: old car tires with traces of coal, slate, and a hint of licorice; the finish has strong overtones of asphalt, midnight sky on a moonless night, blackberries and felt tip marker.</p>
<p>But seriously, does the label say MINORITY OWNED BUSINESS on it??</p>

		<p>Any MBA with Proctor and Gamble experience ought to know that such a venture would be far more profitable and stand a far better chance of national success on the bottom end. As in a lable like Midnight Train to Mandelaville (available in six flavours) complete with a little fold out brochure with some Great Moments of African <br>
Pride fairy tale attached to the back of the flask. That quality of wine production would also have the best chance of survival in non-white supervised vinyards and wineries.</p>

		<p>Will these black vintners place the photos and names of all the racially cleansed White citizens who were kidnapped/missing or killed because of their &#8221; White skin &#8221; on their wine bottles ? Thank God for the White man&rsquo;s culture and its educational system to allow black Americans to use White man&rsquo;s currency to purchase a wine business.</p>
