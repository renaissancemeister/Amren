<h1>Judge: King Children Must Meet to Discuss Estate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Errin Haines, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, September 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A judge has ordered the surviving children of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King to hold a shareholders&rsquo; meeting to discuss their father&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>The Rev. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued their brother, Dexter King, last year to force him to open the books of their father&rsquo;s estate. The lawsuit claimed Dexter King, the estate&rsquo;s administrator, has refused to provide documents concerning the estate&rsquo;s operations.</p>
<p>Coretta Scott King died in 2006 and Yolanda King, the Kings&rsquo; eldest child, died in 2007  &mdash;  leaving the three remaining siblings as the sole shareholders and directors of their father&rsquo;s estate. It is set up as a corporation, but there has not been an annual shareholders&rsquo; meeting since 2004.</p>
<p>Dexter King has also sued his sister, who administers their mother&rsquo;s estate. He has asked a judge to force his sister to turn over Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s personal papers, including love letters central to a now-defunct $1.4 million book deal.</p>
<p>The siblings&rsquo; relationship has deteriorated in the tense climate created by their legal battle.</p>
<p>At least part of the legal battle could be headed to a jury trial next month. At issue would be whether Dexter King acted financially inappropriately in his role as president and chief executive officer of his father&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dexter King, who lives in California, did not attend Monday&rsquo;s hearing. Attorneys said he was hospitalized for several weeks after the car accident, has had to use a walker and is not allowed to travel because he cannot sit in one position for long periods of time.</p>

		<p>Its ironic that the offspring of a great communist squabble over property rights.  We also might be able to derive proof that communism is not man&rsquo;s natural state solely from this article. </p>

		<p>All the assets will be gone in three or four generations (or sooner) from neglect and mis-managment. The family will milk the legacy for every nickle and then sell the rights to his name for cash. They will squable and bicker amoungst themselves until they sue each other into poverty, enriching the lawyers. I predict their heirs will be on the dole with their hand out within 20 years. MLK will be an obscure figure but generations of his people will believe he freed the slaves, was beaten by racist cops and that he invented the street sign</p>

		<p>Is there anything more shamelessly tacky than Dexter King releasing his parents&rsquo; love letters for a quick buck?</p>
<p>Then aqain, if the King children couldn&rsquo;t leach off their parents any longer they might be forced to work for a living&hellip;</p>

Not to worry, I&rsquo;m sure there will be some sort of a government position for such august personalities as the King siblings.</p>
