<h1>Van Jones, Victim of Hate-Broadcast Terrorism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Black Star News (New York), September 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>So we see the Witch hunt escalating. This is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Van Jones, the White House environmental adviser resigned last night following a smear campaign launched by Glenn Beck and other Republicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Republicans dug up various incidents from Jones&rsquo; background; that he once headed an organization that fought police brutality; that he was one of the demonstrators who protested the police brutalization of Rodney King; that he once described himself as a socialist; that he criticized white owned companies for dumping toxic waste in African American neighborhoods; and that he signed a petition which questioned whether the government&rsquo;s laxity allowed the 9/11 tragedy to occur.</p>
<p>Jones is a brilliant graduate of Yale and is respected globally as an expert on &#8220;green&#8221; jobs and the environment.</p>
<p>So, without giving Jones the opportunity to address or rebut any of his attackers, cyber terrorists started spreading the allegations over the Internet and over hate-broadcast news shows such as Glenn Beck&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck is the same verbal terrorist who, on national television, lost his mind a few weeks ago and accused President Obama  &mdash;  whose mother was White and was raised by White grandparents  &mdash;  of being a &#8220;racist&#8221; who was against &#8220;the White culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There will be more of this type of witch hunt. Republicans will go through the trash cans of all Presidential appointees, dig whatever may appear objectionable, when not placed in context, and spread the information over the hate-broadcast waves presided over by Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We saw how they maligned the president&rsquo;s plan to address the nation&rsquo;s students and urge them to work hard in school, by labeling it as &#8220;political brainwashing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Make no mistake, these hate-broadcast terrorists want to undo the results of the 2008 election.</p>
<p>They will oppose the president on everything he does; not out of principle or the national interest, but simply because they hate the fact that the base for their narrow partisan views continue to shrink.</p>

		<p>My favorite lie from this rant was when the writer whines that poor Mr. Jones was criticized because &#8220;he signed a petition which questioned whether the government&rsquo;s laxity allowed the 9/11 tragedy to occur&#8221;.</p>
<p>That would have been a legitimate petition. However the one Van Jones signed asked whether Bush &#8220;deliberately allowed 9/11 to happen, perhaps as a pretext for war.&#8221;</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised how many authors for black newspapers are really college age red diaper grandkids/great-grandkids carrying on the family traditions. And these kids aren&rsquo;t black. They of course are usually &#8220;ghost writers&#8221;, letting an angry black face take credit for the anti-white drivel, but it&rsquo;s the families of these &#8220;kids&#8221; who actually fund these papers and organizations and help keep them alive. </p>

		<p>This is such a crock.  Van Jones is a self-described COMMUNIST, not &#8220;socialist.&#8221;  Make no mistake, this man is a marxist who will stop at nothing, including calling Republicans &#8220;a**holes&#8221; on TV - to implement the marxist agenda to take over and destroy this country.  Glenn Beck is a patriot of the finest order, and yes, he will stop at nothing to make sure b**stards like Van Jones DON&rsquo;T get to put their red agendas into practice.  I line up behind Beck proudly, and suggest that everyone else do the same.  You might also take a look at the Oathkeepers site and support them too.  This is a war, friends, make no mistake about it.  It&rsquo;s a war that WE have to win!!!</p>

		<p>I predict there will be a lot of comments stating how great Glenn Beck is and what a patriot he is. Lets get the facts straight. Van Jones may be a little out there, but at least he tells the truth. Glenn states that current immigrants make this country &#8220;great&#8221;. He brands Americans, and the readers here, who are worried about the racial changes immigration is causing to this country as evil racists. Jones sticks up for his race by telling what he thinks is the truth. Beck throws his own daughter under the bus by saying, several times, that Islam is a good religion. Any real father would say that any religion that says his daughter is not a member of his family is a bad religion, or at least do what Rush does and not take a position on Islam. Instead, he refuses to stick up for his family and makes millions talking about how he loves his family and country. I guess my &#8220;ideals and values&#8221; are just different from his. He once wondered on his show if the world was ending because the Bible states that &#8221; evil will be good and good will be evil&#8221; and &#8220;nations(races) will be at war with each other. On his next show he stated that Islam was a peaceful religion and immigration was good for this country. What a fake.</p>

<p>I suppose this &#8220;journalist&#8221; hasn&rsquo;t looked at any polling results since about mid-January or so, at least those outside of Ebony or Jet magazine. The tide of popular opinion is steadily turning against the leftist radicals in charge of the federal government, long before Van Jones appeared on the nation&rsquo;s consciousness.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Jones is a brilliant graduate of Yale.&#8221;  Such credentials would carry more weight if not for the pervasiveness of affirmative action programs.  Because of such programs, he will have to prove his &#8220;brilliance&#8221; in other ways.<br>

		<p>Anonymous is correct about Glenn Beck inasmuch as comparing him to Van Jones. Actually both are merely puppets for the folks really in charge. Beck is up front to make it look as if there is opposition, but here he is every day telling us we need immigrants because they are better at so many jobs Americans are unable, unqualified to do, never mind jobs he claims (like his masters) Americans won&rsquo;t do. There are a lot of clods who need to be told good riddance and then fired out of a cannon aimed into the middle of the ocean. Van Jones and Glenn Beck are merely two of them. </p>

		<p>Darn it, Glenn.  You could have gone a little easier, so we could have kept Jones around for a while longer.  </p>
<p>This guy is as stupid as the brilliant Professor Gates who thought he had started a national movement on racial profiling with his, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll see yo&rsquo; mama outside.&#8221;  Will these great minds never cease shooting themselves in the foot?</p>
<p>But, on second thought, there&rsquo;s thirty-five more Czars every bit as bad as Jones, so all that&rsquo;s necessary for the talk show guys, the bloggers, and the WND crowd to do, is pick one and check into his/her background.  The videos, and their writings alone, are more likely than not damning in themselves without any comment or critique.</p>
<p>This Valerie Jerrett is a real winner.  She&rsquo;s the one responsible for getting the most radical of these oddballs appointed.  Unfortunately, she&rsquo;s just a Marxist who espouses the usual trivial anti-capitalist rant, but I&rsquo;m hoping she could be outed maybe on her writings.  There&rsquo;s also at least one video where she&rsquo;s extolling the many talents of the brilliant Van Jones.  She says she&rsquo;s been following this rising star &#8220;since Oakland,&#8221; and I believe she takes credit for bringing him on board. (His first outwardly communist admissions)</p>
<p>This Obama administration is beginning to look like they might be on the far left of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s great president Mugabe, and just as anti-white also.  All of them are just dying to go to Cuba and meet Mr. Personality himself, the effervescent sparkling, bon vivant, Fidel Castro, because he&rsquo;s done such great things to his country.  I mean &#8220;for&#8221; his country.</p>
<p>I heard a rumor that they like to think of themselves collectively as Bill Ayers lite, in his younger years.  And every single one of them thinks that Bernadine Dorhn is a shrinking violet.</p>
<p>This is the first president in history who has an entire administration that is to the far left of the old Soviet Kremlin.</p>

<p>First, calling Glenn Beck a &#8220;verbal terrorist&#8221; is going way too far.  He may be wacky, but he is no terrorist of any kind.  And whoever wrote this sure doesn&rsquo;t get much credibility by throwing the &#8220;T&#8221; word around so loosely, neither does he/she by calling Beck&rsquo;s show a &#8220;hate-broadcast&#8221;.  Anyone who really listens to him knows he&rsquo;s not full of hate.  Contempt for the stupid (think Moron Trivia), lazy and evil yes, but hate, no.</p>
<p>Second, wasn&rsquo;t it BHO himself who referred to his maternal grandmother as a &#8220;typical white person&#8221;?  What the heck did he mean by that?  Has he ever explained it?  It sure doesn&rsquo;t sound very complimentary.</p>

		<p>Poor, poor Van&hellip;imagine that: when you call a certain group of people despicable names, say vile things about them and accuse them of injustices, they get angry and start complaining. How self  centered of them. </p>
<p>Like I said, far from &#8216;transcending race,&rsquo; Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;coronation&rsquo; will do more damage to race relations than the Civil War. Every single policy, comment or action during his term will be reduced to nothing but race and racism. It will set this country back 40 years. At least.</p>

		<p>Black Star News-whatever that is- is absolutely correct. There will be more witch hunts. Just like the witch hunts by democrats that went through all the trash cans of the republicans for 8 years, digging up anything they thought objectionable and using it out of context. And spreading the disinformation over the hate-filled broadcast airwaves presided over by Keith Olberman, Rachel Maddow, Al Franken, the New York Times, the Washington Post, NBC, ABC, CBS, ACORN, and even the BLACK STAR NEWS-whatever that is. What&rsquo;s the matter, are you upset that there are people giving Obama and his crew the same level of support and respect that you all gave to Bush? </p>

<p>Has everyone seen Detroit, or at least taken the youtube vista cruise of the downtrodden neighborhoods? I wonder just how many whites have been going up there and dumping all of those tires in the nice, clean, safe black neighborhood? Pretty much the same in any black neighborhood too as we all know.</p>

		<p>i have met quite a few &#8216;brilliant&rsquo; (non oriental) minority ivy league graduates. Can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve ever been impressed.<br>
It&rsquo;s so pervasive now, I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone taking the &#8216;ivy league&rsquo; label seriously anymore. It&rsquo;s just a seal of approval from the elite, nothing else. Thats why smart white kids from conservative christian backgrounds are so hard to find there, as Pat Buchanan points out. </p>

		<p><i> Remarks of brilliant Yale grad were taken out of context.</i></p>
<p>Brilliant, alright.</p>
<p>The only reason why calling Van Jones &#8220;brilliant&#8221; may survive ridicule is because he didn&rsquo;t have to take an IQ test while in school.</p>
<p>IQ tests were ruled discriminatory by the Supreme Court in 1971, and this ruling allowed &#8220;brilliant&#8221; Van Joneses, now exempted from having their actual intelligence tested, to move upward and take positions traditionally reserved for Americans with high IQ.</p>
<p>Many blacks exhibit the so called &#8220;winning personality&#8221; trait that allows them to talk freely, if not enthusiastically, about subjects that they don&rsquo;t understand. This often creates false impression of their being &#8220;brilliant&#8221;, as in the eyes of public opinion oratory skills are synonymous with intelligence.<br>

		<p>As I have been watching the Van Jones affair unravel on TV, it occurred to me that few Blacks realize the effect that the espousal of Communism has on Whites, especially those over forty.  Many of us have had relatives who suffered under Communism; many have known people who had escaped Communist oppression.</p>
<p>No American Black today has ever been a slave.  Most Whites have known people who have been held in slavery under Communism.  We tend to have a much more realistic view than do Blacks toward Communism.</p>
