			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ari B. Bloomekatz, Los Angeles Times, September 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Authorities used pepper spray to help end a racially charged fight among two dozen juvenile prisoners at Camp Kilpatrick in Malibu over the weekend, officials said.</p>
<p>The brawl began with name-calling between an African American and a Latino in the camp&rsquo;s dormitory at about 6:30 p.m. Saturday, said Los Angeles County Chief Probation Officer Robert Taylor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> &#8220;We&rsquo;ll be looking into the causes of this and having a larger discussion of how we&rsquo;re housing minors,&#8221; Taylor said.<br>

		<p>Malibu, huh?  Talk about the hard life of an inmate.  Aren&rsquo;t you glad you played by the rules all these years?  Look at the skid row you could have ended on.</p>
<p>I suppose the rationale for having a juvenile &#8220;camp&#8221; in Malibu is that their being around Malibu will make it rub off on them.</p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t change human nature: virtually all animal species prefer their own kind over other kinds.  Spending Billions of Dollars on massive indoctrination promoting a multicultural paradise is useless, because &#8220;education&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t change genes.  </p>
<p>Preference for one&rsquo;s own kind is a &#8220;Biological law&#8221; and is demonstrated every day in TV program selection, lunch rooms, weddings, neighborhoods, and prisons across America, and, indeed, all over the world.  Only an idiot or someone with an agenda would deny this.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s part of the effort of our state and county government here in California to move the juvenile offenders into nice neighborhoods so they&rsquo;ll be nice rather than say to themselves &#8220;look at all the possibilities HERE.&#8221; Lol&hellip; Yes I&rsquo;m being serious.</p>

		<p>And the black/Hispanic fighting in California continues unabated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s continuing on as expected, but also expected, of course, is an acceleration of conflicts in the schools, prisons, and neighborhoods over jobs, living space, social benefits, culture, traditions and, most especially, race.  Both groups hate each other, really, if a fine point were to be insisted on to better define what is happening and why.</p>
<p>California is still the odds on favorite of being ground zero in the coming clashes, and every indication every day reinforces that estimation by the experts.</p>
<p>I think the next year or so will tell us exactly what is going to unfold and the answers to the questions when and where will be obvious at that time.</p>
<p>Are you ready? </p>

		<p>It is ironic that California is supposed to be this multicultural, leftwing paradise and yet it has the worst race problems of any state.</p>

		<p>You cant change human nature, thats why the agenda is to change the human- through mixed breeding, then nobody has a true identity. I have seen it in my own family.</p>

		<p>and they(lewf wingers) say &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t matters&#8221; but in almost every cases RACE really matters. So much from multi culti its total FAILURE in western world (especially in US). Isn&rsquo;t diversity great.  </p>

		<p>The level part of Malibu is about 50 to 100 yards wide, with the Pacific Coast Highway in the middle of it.  Everything else is steep, brush covered hills, up to 3000 feet, with terraces for the big houses.  These juvenile camps are scattered throughout the mountains surrounding Los Angeles, convenient for putting the little criminals to work cutting brush for firebreaks and the like, and hard to escape from.  Trying to hike up and down 45 degree slopes covered with interlocked manzanita plants, or crawling through poison oak in the the lower canyons, is a lot harder that walking across the desert.  Trust me, the juveniles are not hanging out at the beach.  </p>

		<p>This is the state that recently ordered desegration of its jails and prisons, because there is nothing so important for a state with a massive budget shortfall - the university system there must cut 20% out of its budget - than to have to unnecessarily rebuild state-own facilities trashed or burned down by rioting inmates.</p>
<p>Very good points by Anonymous on September 11, to which I will add that the mountains and hills in that area are crawling with rattlesnakes.  Not a place I would pick for a nice scramble through dense brush!</p>

		<p>Granted camps Miller and Kilpatrick are high up in the foothills of Malibu and somewhat primitive but you could walk out of there following the many trails as long as you are familiar with the terrain to a waiting automobile. Rattlesnakes hibernate in the winter and if you leave them alone and keep a good eye out you&rsquo;re fine. I hate to tell you this but it doesn&rsquo;t take Papillon to walk out of there fellas.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot of hiking in the hills and mountains in SoCal in the last 20 years, and I&rsquo;ve seen more rattlesnakes than Blacks.  Once you leave the picnic areas, Mexicans are pretty rare too.  A few of the bad boys might try to escape, but generally they&rsquo;re as afraid of the dark and the snakes as I&rsquo;m afraid of having my car break down on Saturday night in Compton.  Any numbers on how many little thugs from the honor ranches actually manage to sneak off?  In any case, they&rsquo;re still not on the beach drinking margaritas, they&rsquo;re busy sweating away keeping the trails in good shape for Whites who actually like the outdoors.  </p>

		<p>I have to disagree with anonymous&rsquo;s last post. I too have done quite a bit of hiking all over Southern California including state parks and forest areas and encountered plenty of Mexicans. Many were not nice people. But this is not a surprise to anyone willing to look at the census data for this state as they are 51% of the population. There are quite a few articles on the damage they have done to our state parks which you can research at your leisure. </p>

		<p>I know about the way Mexicans mess up our parks.  For readers who don&rsquo;t live around Mexicans, there was an article from V-Dare on this site several months ago about Hansen Dam Park and the way the Mexicans treat it.  But like I wrote, I don&rsquo;t see Mexicans out on the trails, away from the picnic areas.  And in the National Forest immediate north of the LA basin, where the recent fires where, there are very few picnic areas.  A day in the San Gabriel Mountains is a day without Mexicans.</p>
