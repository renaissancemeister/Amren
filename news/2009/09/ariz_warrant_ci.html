			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel de Vise, Washington Post, September 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Montgomery College President Brian K. Johnson on Wednesday launched a defense of his administration, characterizing recent allegations of mismanagement and overspending as a &#8220;vicious attack on my credibility&#8221; by labor groups seeking advantage in contract negotiations.</p>
<p>More than 200 full-time faculty supported a vote of no-confidence in Johnson last week, 52, president of Maryland&rsquo;s largest community college since 2007. Trustees are scheduled to meet in closed session at the college Thursday at 6 p.m. to consider Johnson&rsquo;s performance in light of a report, prepared by faculty leadership groups and delivered to the board, that alleges Johnson was frequently absent from his office, skipped important meetings, intimidated staff and overspent with his corporate credit card. &#8220;I am disappointed,&#8221; Johnson said in a prepared statement, &#8220;that some members of the Montgomery College family have recently spread frivolous allegations in a vicious attack on my credibility. I have assured the Board of Trustees that these lies and half-truths will not detract from our efforts to ensure that students at Montgomery College receive a quality education, and attend world-class facilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The comments Johnson issued Wednesday marked his first public response to the faculty report, which alleges specific instances of missed meetings, charges to limousine services and evidence of &#8220;extensive travel&#8221; as trips have been curtailed for others at the college.</p>
<p>Johnson provided written explanations and clarifications to many details of the faculty document, whose contents were leaked and appeared in news reports last week. He had previously declined to comment on the advice of his attorney.</p>
<p>The president said a $4,051 hotel bill in Delhi, cited as a symbol of overspending, did not involve college funds. He said the trip had a legitimate purpose: to bring business to a county incubator in Germantown. He said he was not provided final documentation on the expense.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A $780 tab from Lifestyle Transportation, a Boston limousine service, was for town cars, not limousines, Johnson said, and was booked for a member of the board of trustees who traveled with Johnson and another college official.</p>
<p>Johnson said he had not seen a full breakdown of the $58,165 charged on his corporate card between July 2007 and April 2009, as recorded in expense documents obtained by faculty through public records requests. He said that his corporate credit card had been &#8220;compromised&#8221; during that span and that some items in the records might be fraudulent. There was no explanation of how the card was compromised.</p>
<p>Johnson also has been plagued by persistent reports that he owes back child support. He appears on a list of &#8220;deadbeat parents&#8221; on the Internet site of the Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff, based on a bench warrant issued last year for $12,000 owed to a former spouse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson also said he has never censored materials, answering another faculty allegation, and he &#8220;vehemently&#8221; denied the claims of some employees that listening devices had been installed in college offices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The faculty report also cites &#8220;threats of retaliation, and explosive, targeted rage&#8221; from Johnson. &#8220;Not true,&#8221; the president replied, saying he had received no formal complaints on behavior.</p>
<p>As for an Aretha Franklin performance scheduled for Sept. 11 at a cost near $150,000, Johnson said only $20,000 of that sum comes from the college&rsquo;s operating budget.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Kristi Jourdan, Washington Times, September 3, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Maricopa County sheriff&rsquo;s detectives want to talk with embattled Montgomery College President Brian K. Johnson about an outstanding warrant that would land him in jail if he returned to Arizona.</p>
<p>Capt. Larry Farnsworth said the department is looking at Mr. Johnson, who is accused of owing at least $12,000 in child support in Maricopa County, Ariz., and confirmed the warrant is still active in that state.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d love to convince him to come back,&#8221; Capt. Farnsworth told The Washington Times. &#8220;I&rsquo;m happy to make him a resident of our jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the sheriff&rsquo;s Web site, Mr. Johnson is listed as one of the county&rsquo;s &#8220;deadbeat parents.&#8221; The site asks for information regarding his location and says an arrest warrant was sent to a Pennsylvania address of the college president and his wife in October  &mdash;  after Mr. Johnson sold the home, according to property records.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;d be happy to put him in jail,&#8221; Capt. Farnsworth told The Times. &#8220;We&rsquo;re an equal opportunity arrester.&#8221;</p>
<p>Capt. Farnsworth said Mr. Johnson could not be extradited from Maryland based on the warrant.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t want him, but once he&rsquo;s out of state we can&rsquo;t touch him,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maricopa Superior Court records list three cases dating back to 1997 involving child support issues with two different women. The records also show that twice in the past two months Mr. Johnson updated his contact information with the court.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Detective Aaron D. Douglas said that while the $12,000 Mr. Johnson owed only ranked him at 145 of the 1,200 &#8220;deadbeats&#8221; listed on the sheriff&rsquo;s Web site, it was still a hefty sum.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The warrant became an issue last week, when someone draped a large banner across fencing near the Rockville campus announcing the unsatisfied Arizona debt. The banner was hung a day after faculty members voted no confidence in Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s leadership.</p>

		<p>This brother is living large. How many of his students have to work and take courses part-time because they can&rsquo;t afford to go to this public college fulltime? Maybe the Prez would like to pull latrine duty for a while to pay back what he stole. Cause the value of his services as President is Zero.</p>

		<p>Only a matter of time before we hear  that this investigation is &#8220;racist&#8221;. So happens I&rsquo;m quite familiar with this situation. The Board of Regents launched a highly publicised 7 month  nationwide search for a President. The result: they came up with this incompetent poltroon.  Tells you all you need to know about the board of regents - the same bunch of cretens who are pushing the college to hire more blacks and hispanics.<br>
  How to react to these absurdities? In a rational society this guy would be waiting on tables someplace. Right now he is a college president. Do you laugh or cry? Take your pick.<br>

		<p>Here in the UK, we are half way through series 5 of &#8216;The Wire&rsquo; and watch it between 2320 and 0020 hrs three times a week. After reading this AMREN story, I look forward to the next showing of this TV programme which appears to mirror what is happening in real life. I hope B K Johnson is not brought to justice much before midnight on Monday 7th September 2009 as it will ruin my forthcoming viewing pleasure although the above photograph is uncannily similar to the actor in the plot! </p>

		<p>Gee, what a shock! Treating a quasi government job like a personal fiefdom was he? Who does he think he is, Charlie Rangel?<br>
As of late Thursday night (03SEP09) he was put on paid leave and his contract will not be renewed.<br>
His contract runs thru June! Wow, a year&rsquo;s worth - $233,000 - of vacation.<br>
The article in the (ick) Washington Post also stated he, &#8220;destabilized the college in 2 1/2 years of leadership by disappearing from office for days at a time, missing important events, intimidating staff and overspending with his corporate credit card.&rdquo;<br>
The board appointed Hercules Pinkney interim president. Mr. Pinkney is the retired head of the Germantown, Maryland campus. Hmmm, we shall see. <br>

		<p>This is why blacks will never build a society with the cohesion necessary to be fuctional on any kind of large level. Their propensity for corruption is monumental and their arrogance in light of misdeeds is appaulling. </p>
<p>He sincerely believes that fault lies with the people who convicted him not with himself and if he could he would hire a hit squad to silence their dissent. Another black despot who thinks he should be totally unaccountable to anyone. </p>

		<p>Wow! What ugly comments regarding race.</p>
<p>So, from the comments I gather that the financial meltdown in our economy where most, if not all, of the leaders were white is no indication that the typical white guy/father/man/leader is greedy, lacks integrity, lacks honesty, and is corrupt and sex-crazed. I guess Bernie Madoff is just an anomaly? I guess that the mass school killings and the like that have been done mostly by white males is no indication that the typical white, frustrated white male is a time-bomb waiting to happen. And when it comes to treason to America, you guessed it, most, if not all, white males.</p>
<p>Brian Johnson&rsquo;s race has nothing to do with it. He is just another case of a greedy, dishonest, corrupt leader that has populated this society too much of late and he happens to be black.</p>

		<p>17 Anon: The point is not that Whites don&rsquo;t do these things, but that Blacks are more likely to behave this way.  And part of that is because, in the interest of &#8220;diversity&#8221;, they are promoted to positions that they have neither the skill nor the character to fill.  Furthermore, because it is the policy of all institutions that practice affirmative action to deny that they have lowered their standards, these institutions have to look the other way when the quota hires prove to be less competent.  </p>
<p>If I recall correctly, something like 70 % of arrests (convictions?) for fraud in this country are of Blacks, but almost entirely for small amounts.  That&rsquo;s because most Whites with money instinctively mistrust jive talkers.  It takes a much more intelligent, sophisticated, culturally adept liar to fool large numbers of rich Whites. Somebody like Bernie Madoff, who fit into the social world of philanthropy, for example.  There may not be a single Black criminal in the country who can keep up with the Wall Street crowd.  They&rsquo;re evil, but they&rsquo;re real smart and well-educated too.  </p>
<p>So, instead of comparing Brian K. Johnson to the banksters, compare him to his peers, college presidents.  How many White college presidents have put themselves in his predicament?  </p>
<p>As for the business about White kids shooting up their schools, you are choosing your categories too narrowly.  No doubt you could choose a category of crime in which Chinese greatly outnumber Blacks, say, home invasions robbers seeking gold coins.  Focusing on mass school shootings as opposed to killings in general obscures the fact that the Black murder rate is 11 times the White rate.  And that is the core of most White&rsquo;s objections to Blacks.  Not that there aren&rsquo;t good and capable Blacks, but that they are such a small proportion of their people, compared to the proportion of Whites who are both honest and capable. </p>
