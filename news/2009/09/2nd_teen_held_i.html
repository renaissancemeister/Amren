<h1>2nd Teen Held in North Miami-Dade Horse Killings</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jose Pagliery, Miami Herald, Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police have arrested a second teen in connection with the recent North Miami-Dade horse killings that are believed to be fueled by a market for equine meat.</p>
<p>Santiago Cabrera, a 19-year-old from Hialeah, was arrested Monday night and charged with armed burglary, animal cruelty, killing a registered breed horse and breaking or injuring a fence. Last week, police arrested Luis Miguel Cordero, 18, on similar charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cabrera and Cordero are believed to be among four people who took part in killing a horse at two different ranches. Miami-Dade police are still searching for two other suspects whose names have not been released.</p>
<p>It is unclear if the two teens are linked to other horse killings in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. At least 17 horses have been slaughtered this year in South Florida.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Horse owners have discovered their pets&rsquo; butchered remains in pastures and along rural roads  &mdash;  one even in its own stall  &mdash;  after they became apparent victims of a black-market demand for horse meat.</p>
<p>Cordero was arrested last week after investigators received a tip that he was planning to kill another horse. Detectives said they placed a wire on a man who was approached by Cordero and offered $2,000 to take part in the slaughter. Police said Cordero  &mdash;  who was found with a duffle bag filled with garbage bags, rope and a butcher knife  &mdash;  confessed to breaking into a Miami Gardens ranch on Sept. 9.</p>
<p>According to police, Cordero and others secretly entered the Lazy L Ranch in the 5400 block of Northwest 159th Street and pulled the horse, King Quizi, out of its stall.</p>
<p>The police report states Cordero &#8220;used a rope to tie the horse&rsquo;s legs and push it to the ground.&#8221; Another man nicknamed Flaco then &#8220;cut the horse&rsquo;s throat and immediately began to cut the horse&rsquo;s front quarters as the horse was suffering an agonizing death.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stuffed the meat into bags and drove off in a red pickup truck, according to the report.</p>
<p>Cordero was arrested days later and was being held without bond Tuesday at the Metro West Detention Center.</p>

		<p>Two earrings on Cabrera. Wow!! These people need to be removed from this nation, with such extreme prejudice that they will never ever again decide to violate U.S. Immigration law. Many of these hispanics/Mexicans have proven over, and over and over, that they don&rsquo;t respect this nation, and its citizens. If it&rsquo;s not one crime they commit, it&rsquo;s another. Amnesty would be the biggest mistake this nation could make, next to keeping the border with Mexico open. Some of the early founding fathers of this nation were of the opinion that to become involved with Mexico, would be the ruin of the U.S. It&rsquo;s coming true.</p>

		<p>Human consumption of horse meat is not that big of a deal in and of itself.            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_meat" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_meat</a>  As I recall, there was a so called &#8220;meat shortage&#8221; in this country in the the summer of 1977 and ground horsemeat was retailed in mainstream supermarkets for a while. The meat shortage was later determined to have been contrived by the meat packing industry. </p>
<p>In any case though, theft of livestock is dimly viewed throughout the world and summary execution of livestock thieves has a long history of social acceptance.</p>

		<p>Dang!  How much meat is on a horse &amp; how much can you get per pound to be able to offer somebody $2,000 to help kill one???</p>
<p>A quick Google search shows a thoroughbred weighs about 1000 pounds.  The rule of thumb is an animal dresses out at about 1/2 the weight, so that&rsquo;s 500 pounds of meat.  Less if you&rsquo;re in a hurry.  Your accomplice gets $4 per pound.  So, if you&rsquo;re splitting the proceeds 50/50 (which is a poor assumption, since you found the horse and know where to fence the meat) the horsemeat is at least $8/pound.  You can get some pretty good steak for that price!  </p>

		<p>Exactly why these people should not be in our country. They come to the US for opportunity - criminal opportunity. It seems that no matter what opportunities they are given, turning an illegal buck is the one they choose and most succeed at.<br>
  <br>
I wonder where the demand for horse meat is so great that this destruction of property and animal cruelty is such a lucrative business.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had horsemeat in Europe, and it wasn&rsquo;t bad at all.  Part of the problem here may be that laws passed sometime in the last decade made it illegal to sell horsemeat for human consumption in the United States.  The law - written at the behest of weepy animal-lovers of the sort who think &#8220;Charlotte&rsquo;s Web&#8221; was non-fiction - has simply forced the trade underground, driven up prices, and given criminals a lucrative business (remember Prohibition?).  Unfortunately, breeders and their thoroughbreds are paying the price.</p>

		<p>Meat is meat.  However it&rsquo;s one thing to do it legally and another to do it illegally.  What I don&rsquo;t get is where the demand for horsemeat is?  Is there a large European population in Miami?  Or is this going to be linked to some less than reputable immigrant run resturaunts?</p>
