<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/us/politics/01rights.html">Justice Department to Recharge Civil Rights Enforcement</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlie Savage, New York Times, September 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As part of this shift, the Obama administration is planning a major revival of high-impact civil rights enforcement against policies, in areas ranging from housing to hiring, where statistics show that minorities fare disproportionately poorly. President George W. Bush&rsquo;s appointees had discouraged such tactics, preferring to focus on individual cases in which there is evidence of intentional discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the critics, Hans von Spakovsky, a former key Bush-era official at the division, has accused the Obama team of &#8220;nakedly political&#8221; maneuvers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In July, moreover, the division&rsquo;s acting head, Loretta King, sent a memorandum to every federal agency urging more aggressive enforcement of regulations that forbid recipients of taxpayer money from policies that have a disparate impact on minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> &#8220;Of course there are going to be critics,&#8221; Mr. Holder said. But, he argued, &#8220;any objective observer&#8221; would see the recent approach as consistent with &#8220;the historical mission of the division, not straying into some kind of liberal orthodoxy. It really is just a function of enforcing the statutes.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Almost a year ago now, I wrote that this black anti-white racist in the Whitehouse was first, last and always pro-black and his entire reason for wanting the job as president was to promote every single policy and program that would benefit blacks, and if any other race benefitted somehow it was strictly an unintended consequence.</p>
<p>This is just one more piece of data verifying that hypothesis, added to what already has been revealed.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck has laid out data in quite a convincing fashion that Obama&rsquo;s intention is to shift as much wealth as possible from whites to blacks by any means necessary.  He has also revealed that the entire administration is one fixated on Castro and communism and are cheer leaders for Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, because of his covert ploy to get elected via the democratic process, then change gears after getting in office to make a fast transition to a totalitarian-run regime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one more model for Obama to follow.</p>
<p>Many people are as aware as I am about the current very dark situation, but I&rsquo;m absolutely amazed that not even one single Democrat or Republican in Congress is demanding an investigation into this administration&rsquo;s aims and intents and it&rsquo;s appointments of far, far left radicals to government positions with several of them being out and out revolutionaries, who have the takeover of the US on their agenda and have made speeches verifying that goal as recent as the first of this year.</p>
<p>I wish Glenn Beck well.  But I fear for his safety.  No one&hellip;.EVER&hellip;..has come right out and revealed black racism and totalitarian control as he has done.</p>
<p>Right now the radical Color of Change is spewing hatred galore against him and have naively expected that they could remove all advertisers to his show and run him off the air, but he&rsquo;s gotten stronger instead, and his audience figures break viewing records almost every night.</p>
<p>What concerns me is that these hysterical blacks just might resort to violence and try to take him out, when their peaceful attempts have run their course without doing anything more than providing him with additional followers and fans.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the gutsiest guys I&rsquo;ve ever known.  And I&rsquo;ve known a few.</p>

		<p>America has chosen its fate, this will be the most spectacular fall in human history after the Roman Empire&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>The magnitude of what happened in last election is mind boggling, over 200 million white people voted their own destruction.</p>
<p>America is the first country in history to freely elect black marxist to rule over them in a bolshevik system without precedent in history.</p>
<p>The only explanation is that Americans are totally brainwashed.</p>

<p>Before the election of Obama, I said one positive is that this happened while we still have a white majority.</p>
<p>If a black man were elected when whites were a minority, it would have been Zimbabwe USA. That blacks have been allowed to reveal their motives before they&rsquo;ve established firm control might awaken white people.</p>
<p>I, for one, hope they overplay their hand.<br>

		<p>We now see the naked truth in Obama&rsquo;s and Holder&rsquo;s civil rights campaign: the administration will condone gross violations of Whites&rsquo; voting rights by the Black Panthers, but will hold an inquisition on every objective and race-neutral policy that has a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on minorities (of course, without any regard to whether traits and skills are &#8220;disparately distributed&#8221; among the races). </p>

<p>In other words the Justice Department will make sure that Minority Rights are enforced. Just in case somebody from outside the USA is reading this, &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; in America means rights for non-whites. The original term was perverted in the 1960s. The concept of Majority Rights has no currency because our government, media, and institutions of learning are incapable of thinking outside of their clenched-shut mindset. They will blather on about Minority Rights until the Majority Euro Americans are completely overrun in the land their ancestors created. </p>

		<p>AG Holder is saying the US Justice Department will use outcome based metrics applied to employment, admissions, incarcerations, and God knows what else if they disproportionately negatively impact an officially designated &#8220;protected group&#8221; to determine if an investigation or prosecution is warranted.</p>
<p>What this means is that any institution, even though it does not discriminate, will be subject to endless DOJ investigations until it produces the &#8220;politically correct&#8221; outcome based numbers that this Marxist administration desires.  This will have the chilling effect of increasing discrimination against whites from a multitude of sources.</p>
<p>The stupid whites who voted for Obama have no idea what is going to hit them&hellip;.and it serves them right.</p>
<p>I would hope the Republican Party would stand up for what is right, and protect the interests of the whites that are the vast majority of their voters.  However, I anticipate they will say little or nothing being the gutless cowards that they are.</p>

		<p>Great! Just what we need in this struggling economy - more pressure on companies to hire the incompetent. In our unwisdom we inserted the most liberal senator in DC into the white house. Why should we be surprised that we now get more government enforced quota systems? Our half blood prince is determined to ruin what is left of our country. Looks to me as if he is making excellent progress.<br>

		<p>As Glenn Beck as so ably explained, our country, the good old US of A, has been taken over from within, by avowed Marxists.</p>
<p>They have accomplished in the last election what they could never accomplish through direct military action (e.g. movie Red Dawn)  &mdash;  -what is now appearing to be a &#8216;soft coup.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Glenn Beck is very much the Thomas Paine of our generation, and he is sounding the warning. Is everyone listening?</p>
<p>Stand up, America! The freedom that the previous generations safeguarded and handed us can be taken away before you even know it.</p>
<p>We ignore reality at our own peril. This is exactly what the Marxists are counting on.</p>

<p>Racial animosity is spewed directly and indirectly towards white men, essentially for having the will to build productive societies.  While he proceeds to bash the society that has given sustainance to this imbecile and speaks of empowering all forms of coloreds at the expense of white men, he himself selects what surely is a female likely of purest caucasian stock for mating purposes.  The hypocrisy would almost be laughable if it were not so real and destructive to white interests.</p>

		<p>Bizarre as it seems, I have just discovered Glenn Beck. After noticing that most tv&rsquo;s in waiting areas of businesses and doctors&rsquo; offices, etc., locally were tuned to Fox News, I decided to turn it on at home and see what the attraction was. Wow, a tv station for ME!! I was stunned to hear Glenn Beck, wondering how he ever made it past the censors. My only hesitation is that perhaps if he toned down the histrionics just a TAD, he might be taken more seriously by more people. Because everything he says has absolute merit.</p>

		<p>Again, as of this time, if whites are targeted unfairly because of an exaggerated carrying out of civil rights laws for the sake of non-whites, they deserve all of it. As European Aemricans are still the largest racial cultural group in the nation, they could put a stop to the nonsense that directly affects them. </p>

<p>The Color of Change who are &#8220;putting serious pressure on advertisers and they have been caving&#8221; are a rag tag motley group of mentally challenged blacks.</p>
<p>The Color of Change is a Van Jones creation, though he doesn&rsquo;t claim to be with them anymore, which, of course is nonsense.  They are an all black group of radical pro-communists who think when an advertiser agrees with them via phone or puts them off another way, they have emerged victorious.</p>
<p>The boycott was a failure.  Stop and consider why.  Beck has 4 million viewers per night, with millions more tuning in and out his radio show and T.V. program during the week, which add to the viwer figures, making just his listening and viewing audience around 6 to 8 million people, many of which have put the advertisers on notice that if they boycott Beck they will be boycotted themselves.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled, my friend, with a bunch of lying blacks that are too stupid to know they just don&rsquo;t have the numbers to win against anybody they boycott.  They think all they have to do is lie about something and that means everybody will believe them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;AG Holder is saying the US Justice Department will use outcome based metrics applied to employment, admissions, incarcerations,&#8221;</p>
<p>White men, especially those under 50,  take note of the word incarcerations.  Be totally, absolutely scrupulous and law abiding.  Holder will force states and counties to arrest and imprison White men for the slightest crimes, while letting blacks and hispanics run free. He might very well create some new criminal laws designed to specifically apply to White men.</p>
<p>With affirmative action brought to incaracerations, expect to see hundreds of thousands of black and hispanic criminals running free preying on Whites while the Justice Department cheers them on.</p>
<p>A federal Judge has ordered the state of california to free 43,000 criminals.  That&rsquo;s just 1 state.  Think of the black on White crime wave when Holder and complaisant White judges order every state to cut their black and brown criminals loose.</p>
<p>Hitler was not elected, in fact his Nazi party came in 4th or 5th in the 1931 election.  He and his supporters coerced the elected President, Hindenburg into appointing Hitler Chancellor.</p>
<p>Using totally unconstitutional and illegal means, Chancellor Hitler then took total control of the German government.</p>
<p>But we, the beyond stupid American Whites freely elected the instrument of our destruction, Obama and his communist buddies like Emmanuel, Axelrod, Soros, Ayers etc. </p>

		<p>The guy who wrote about white females not dating blacks being taken as RACISM isn&rsquo;t that hard to imagine. Where I work the blacks are on the white females backs dayand night wanting them to go out to be sexual parters. When the girls say no the blacks call them Racists. Now Imagine a place where the black could sue the white female for her PersonalPreference since it doesn&rsquo;t include blacks. If I were the father of a white female who was involved with a black It would break my heart!</p>

		<p>&#8220;America has chosen its fate, this will be the most spectacular fall in human history after the Roman Empire&rsquo;s fall. The magnitude of what happened in last election is mind boggling, over 200 million white people voted their own destruction. America is the first country in history to freely elect black marxist to rule over them in a bolshevik system without precedent in history. The only explanation is that Americans are totally brainwashed. Europe is following closely.&#8221;</p>
<p>What are you talking about?  It is this sort of pessimism that I don&rsquo;t care for.  </p>
<p>First of all, it isn&rsquo;t inevitable that America will fall.  Stop having so little faith in your own people.</p>
<p>Second of all, where are you coming up with 200 million white people voting for Obama?  A lot of white people sat the election out because neither candidate represented them.  Out of the remaining white people, the majority of them voted against Obama.</p>
<p>Third, what are you talking about that Europe is following in our footsteps?  Did you pay attention to the last election over there and what happened?  The right wing parties (that over here would be considered &#8220;racist&#8221;) have been gaining ground year after year.  The same could happen over here if white people had similar right parties that actually represented them.</p>
<p>I wish the people on here would start examining all the facts before posting with such pessimism.  What good does your pessimism do?  Why don&rsquo;t we all just do away with websites such as Amren because according to people like you, the white race is surely doomed and there is no getting out of it.  By saying such things you are throwing away everything that people like Jared Taylor have accomplished and you are also insulting your own race.</p>
<p>According to you, every white person in America is brainwashed (according to what you said word for word in your above post).  Give me a break!</p>

		<p>America is the greatest nation in the history of the world and it has achieved that status due to the courage and character of its people.  The sleeping giant is awakening and Washington&rsquo;s treachery has filled it with a terrible resolve&hellip;</p>

		<p>Apparently, the largest redistribution of wealth in human history, via unpaid credit to &#8220;underserved&#8221; minorities and financing of their risk-free (compliments of the taxpayers and investors) speculation on real estate market, and the financial collapse that it caused weren&rsquo;t enough ripoff (a.k.a. &#8220;social justice&#8221;) to satisfy the hungry throats of the &#8220;gimme-gimme&#8221; people.<br>
