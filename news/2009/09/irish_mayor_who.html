			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Belfast Telegraph, September 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The mayor of Ennis, who led the Co Clare town&rsquo;s welcome to boxing legend Muhammad Ali last week, has warned against housing policies that could lead to &#8220;a glut&#8221; of black families in any one area.</p>
<p>Frankie Neylon said he believed it was better for the council not to house too many black families in any particular area to avoid the creation of &#8220;ghettos&#8221; and to facilitate the integration of black and white families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Six families in one small area is enough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would be concerned if the council keeps giving houses to black families in any particular area, there would be a glut of black families in one area.&#8221; &#8220;If you have too many black people in one area, it is difficult for them to integrate into the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cllr Neylon said that proper planning by the council would avoid the prospect of ghettos in Ennis. &#8220;The allocation of housing to black families should be a little more spread out to give a better blend of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be transparency into how housing is allocated. We have no role whatsoever. At the moment, we are blindfolded on the issue,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>This sounds like the Irish version of Section 8. The only way to prevent black ghettos is to get blacks out of your country. ANY concentration of blacks will lead to a black ghetto. </p>
<p>When the blacks make it intolerable to live in the community, the whites will be accused of racism for complaining and will simply move away. The housing vacated by the whites will fill with more blacks.</p>
<p>It a scenario that has played out thousands of times over in every white majority country in the world. The result will never be any different based on how virtuous any politician believes he is.</p>
<p>Keep blacks out of Ireland - it&rsquo;s the only way to avoid the problem.</p>

		<p>  The Irish have an absolute fascination for American Blacks;  even those of the most sordid personal and public reputation. In 2005, the «Western People&rsquo;» an newspaper published in the West of Ireland, (also available, incidentally, and, not surprisingly, in New Yrk City, Chicago(land), Sacramento, and Los Angeles), anywhere (illegal) Irish «immigrants» tend to congregate. And ghettoize themselves.), published an «article» of supine, fawning, drooling, pseudo - «journalism,» concerning the visit of non other than Mike Tyson (otherwise : «Iron Mike»)(sic), to County Mayo.  Mayo is north and west of County Clare, just north of County Galway, which lies between the two.</p>
<p>  The article quoted the promoter of the event, or,  the pub owner in which the reception for this individual was held, who stated that Tyson «.  .   .has a bad boy image.  .  .» (sic). An curious statement with reference to an individual who was sent to prison for rape, and who, also, bit off an portion of another boxer&rsquo;s ear during a bout.</p>
<p>  The remarkable thing about the Irish is, or, at least, seems to be, the fact that they never, ever learn. They watch, on television, and, because of the high rate of incidence of travel between «America» and «the Republic» they have seen, at first hand, the catastrophe of racial conflict in the United States. And yet (and yet), they continue to regard Blacks as benign, inoffensive, put upon human beings. </p>
<p>  Ghettoes are forming, and, ghettoes are growing, in Dublin, and Waterford, and Wexford, and even Galway and Cork. I think that Ennis, or, another town in the West, even elected a black mayor within the last several years. Of Nigerian origin.  French Arabs riot at Ramadan, Chinese and Arabs have recently rioted in, of all places, Algiers. And yet, the Irish continue to believe that those so preposterously unlike themselves (with some possible exceptions with regard to behavior), are actually good and decent people. </p>
<p>  This sort of mania may be attributable to the irreducible Irish obsession with all things «American;» even one Hewson, J., John, who changed his name to Bono Vox (now simpy «Bono»), once stated that Bruce Springsteen (another symptom of the problem), was not an American at all; but was in fact, from the North Side of Dublin. </p>

To facilitate the integration of black and white families!<br>
Why, why, why is it so necessary to integrate blacks whith whites?  What is this obsession with mixing? Can&rsquo;t people just be left alone to live among their own kind?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not even the real question, though.<br>
The real, fundamental question is why must blacks be imported to come and live in any white country at all?  Why should they even be there?   </p>
<p>We wish them no ill. We mean them no harm. But they are best and happiest among their own kind, and we among ours.</p>
<p>Look at the evidence. No sooner are they established in white countries than they begin to complain. There are not enough black faces on TV, there is roo much racism, the police are unfair, the schools discriminate, career opportunities are limited &hellip; etc., etc.  </p>
<p>White people are mean, the system is racist.  This, despite the fact that whites (and &#8220;the system&#8221;) have takien them in and given them homes, jobs, educations, and opportunities undreamt of at home! Something we did not have to do.</p>
<p>This Marxist mania for mixing is absolutely sick! It is truly a mental illness that has become the most deadly affliction of our times.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s take this to its ultimate conclusion. </p>
<p>The conclusion in &#8220;spreading people out to make them blend better&#8221;  is race-mixing, intermarriage and miscegenation, which will make future Irishmen into brown-eyed mulattos, indistinguishable from Brazilians.</p>
<p>The world has more than enough mulattos,  but not very many Irish.</p>

It&rsquo;s interesting that when you have concentrations of white people, you get safe, clean, order, respectful neighborhoods. When you have a concentration of blacks, you get crime, violence, and ghettos.</p>
<p>Black behavior is universal.</p>

		<p>    &ldquo;If you have too many black people in one area, it is difficult for them to integrate into the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>    The simple solution is: Don&rsquo;t let any of them in! Ireland is a white country. Other races will never fit in or assimilate, even if they are &#8220;spread around&#8221;. <br>
   Here&rsquo;s a question for AmRenners - is it difficult for a white American to move to the EU countries? Do they discriminate against White immigrants? All you ever see are Third-worlders moving there, never White people, except for your occasional celebrity types, I.E. Johnny Depp, etc. I looked into claiming Italian citizenship &#8220;by blood&#8221; through my grandparents, but found out I can&rsquo;t claim it through my grandmother. They only accept claims through the male lineage. That&rsquo;s sexist! Who can I sue? Will the ACLU come to my defense? </p>

		<p>Mr. Frankie Neylon, let&rsquo;s make sure the first four black families moving into white neighborhoods get the houses directly to your own house&rsquo;s left, right, the other side of your back yard, and the house directly across the street from your front door.</p>

		<p>The naivete of this man is mind boggling to those of us who know first hand what its like to live among black. Too bad the Irish will have to find out the hard way that any time you introduce blacks to a neighborhood, they turn it into a ghetto. </p>

		<p>Here in Canada we&rsquo;ve had university professors do research on the tendency of immigrant communities to bunch together into their own enclaves. The professors concluded it was beneficial for these communities and our cities should encourage it. Our newspapers often print glowing accounts of the vibrancy of ethnic neighbourhoods. But it seems in Ireland it is considered a bad thing. So what&rsquo;s the answer? Is it good or bad to disperse or bunch together? Maybe the authorities should get their thinking straight before we bring in any more diversity. </p>

How come, if whites live together in any place, the place becomes community?<br>
How come, if blacks and Latinos live together in any place, the place becomes a ghetto, <br>
like in Detroit: ghetto-city?<br>
like in Mexico: ghetto-country?<br>
like in Africa: ghetto-continent?</p>
<p>Are we reaching a ghetto-planet???</p>

		<p>As an American of mostly Irish descent, I am aghast that Ireland has had such lax immigration laws. Ireland is a White country and should not go down the same sad road as England, France, Germany and almost every other European country. </p>
<p>For years we said &#8220;Brits out&#8221; and were (and still are) right to do so, but then we also have to say Nigerians out, Pakistanis out, etc. Irish Americans need to renew their interest in Irish nationalism if we are to save Ireland. </p>

		<p>Oh good lord Frankie Neylon, get a grip!!!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when Europeans (back in the 1970s, when most parts of Europe were still almost entirely white) would be puzzled by white American &#8220;prejudice&#8221; toward blacks. Of course, like present-day Canadian liberals, they had just about zero percent experience with blacks and 100 percent certainty of their own opinion on the topic. If that attitude wasn&rsquo;t stupid enough, they would also think of themselves as superior to Americans. How ironic. Utterly clueless. Don&rsquo;t laugh, but those attitudes are not entirely dead there. They really don&rsquo;t get it. If only they that class of European could understand how Americans really view them: Retrograde, vain characters living in a fantasy world. </p>

		<p>Why are there even any balcks in Ireland in the first place? Shouldn&rsquo;t they have learned from Britian? Is the White race suicidal? If there are blacks in Ireland there are most CERTAINLY going to be black ghettos there too. The only solution is to remove the blacks fron the emerald isle and let no more in.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 3, really interesting observations about the Irish.  They are a strange people.  They are the only race to have accepted the Catholic faith without martyrs.  There was an Irish regiment that wouldn&rsquo;t fight against the Mexicans in the Mexican war because they were fellow Catholics.  The Irish were all shot for it.</p>
<p>I think your efforts to explain Irish attitudes towards blacks leaves out their feeling of being the perpetual underdog.  Underdogs sympathize with each other, and blacks are certainly underdogs.</p>
<p>At the same time, when you see white people unwilling to take any baloney from blacks, they are usually either Irish or Italian.</p>
<p>The Irish have a lightness of being about them which makes them pleasant companions at leisure but generally bad partners in matters that require foresight and planning.  They love life and a laugh like the blacks, but unlike the blacks are not lewd or unintelligent.  And they have a strong feeling of justice that usually entails an insistence that everyone gets a fair shake, whatever his color.</p>

		<p>Anyway the old &#8216;black-a-block&rsquo; integration method has saved a number of neighborhoods from destruction.  It&rsquo;s worth a try at least and might work as long as the total number of blacks doesn&rsquo;t become too great.  Eeny meeny, and keep them from becoming too many in one place.  Of course, in order for that to work it is also necessary that the white people not be free to move away&hellip;.</p>

		<p>What do you get when blacks live within and among themselves? You get a ghetto, rife with crime and poverty, maybe a step above life in many areas of Africa today.</p>
<p>But what do you get when blacks live in and among whites? <br>
For the most part, you get increased crime rates, violence, and a gangsta-rap mentality.</p>
<p>The good mayor should understand that social-engineering has only worked to the detriment of society, and should be regarded as a &#8216;crime against nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Until white people have had enough of being defined by others, and stand up for their culture, the genocide that integration brings, will be what we can expect!</p>
<p>When I hear about this naive Irish mayor, I am reminded of the words to &#8216;Ode to a Dying People&rsquo; by Saga. How prophetic, indeed!</p>

		<p>          Yes it&rsquo;s the rebel mentality. Add to that the new conformity of Political Correctness. And presto, people can feel themselves to be rebels and still have the comfort and security of conformity. The Irish are falling for it. Unlike the Jews, they don&rsquo;t have much resilience or real love of themselves. Many of the old Revolutionaries wondered whether it was all worth it after the Revolution. The bougeosie mentality was maintained just changing to an Irish veneer. The country toyed with the idea of a return to the Irish Language, but very few were really interested. They were much more interested in getting ahead American style-even though they&rsquo;ve grown to hate Americans. The best example of all: no force on Earth could make the Irish give up their faith, but they were glad to give it up themselves in favor of getting ahead and rock and roll. As peak oil kicks in and the world economy collapses, they may be saved by the bell. It wont be by virtue. <br>
         <br>
        Also the precedents for all this are hidden deep in the Society. The inner core of the Political Class were Marxists right from the begining. That&rsquo;s the legitimate reason the Church was against Sinn Fein and the IRA. There may be illegitimate reasons as well.</p>

		<p> This sympathy that the Irish have for blacks is mostly a modern product of political correctness,  certainly the Irish immigrants who butchered blacks in New York in the 1860s didn&rsquo;t have it, nor did there seem to be calls for mass non-white immigration into Ireland before recent decades.   This is imposed by the Revolting Elite in Ireland just as it is in America, Britain, Germany, etc.   Certainly the Mayor understands the results of the policy when he decries the concentration of blacks as a bad thing.   All the liberal elite understand the reality of these things,  they believe just about what you believe which is why they live in neighborhoods and send their kids to school where there are no more than a token number of blacks and Hispanics,  and prominent Republicans stay silent about this hypocrisy so they can do the same thing.   They won&rsquo;t send their  daughters or granddaughters walking through black areas.  They know.   Nothing will change as long as this class-based hypocrisy on race is allowed to exist.  </p>
<p>Speaking of the Irish and racism,  what should have been plastered on every talk board on the net after his death was the fact that during the time he was in office tens of thousands of whites (including children) were slaughtered because of their race,  millions (including children) were raped because of their race,  tens of millions injured, and tens of millions ethnically cleansed.  Right outside of his office were streets where no white could walk in safety.  He knew.  His silence for decades amounted to sponsorship of racist mass-crime, including mass-murder.   The fact that such denouncements were no where to be found, not even on a site like this much less on the main media sites,  shows just how bad the situation is in this country, and how tame the system&rsquo;s victims are.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The remarkable thing about the Irish is, or, at least, seems to be, the fact that they never, ever learn. They watch, on television, and, because of the high rate of incidence of travel between «America» and «the Republic» they have seen, at first hand, the catastrophe of racial conflict in the United States. And yet (and yet), they continue to regard Blacks as benign, inoffensive, put upon human beings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that also true for the English,Dutch,Germans,French and other European countries that were allowing hordes of blacks in years before Ireland did?</p>
<p>The immigration floodgates have been opened in Ireland not because of some &#8220;genetic condition&#8221; that causes them to do this, rather because they are a member of the EU and ruling elites are telling their politicians to let in more immigrants.</p>
<p>If you look, there is large anti immigrant sentiment in Ireland, proven by the population overwhelmingly supporting changing their constitution to stop African  welfare seekers abusing the &#8220;child born in Ireland = citizen&#8221; loophole.</p>

		<p>What is most interesting to me is the recognition that too many blacks in one place automatically results in a crime ridden ghetto.  Nobody would worry that a 100% white community would be a ghetto.  Nor would they worry about a 100% Japanese community.</p>

<i>Anyway the old &lsquo;black-a-block&rsquo; integration method has saved a number of neighborhoods from destruction. It&rsquo;s worth a try at least and might work as long as the total number of blacks doesn&rsquo;t become too great. Eeny meeny, and keep them from becoming too many in one place. Of course, in order for that to work it is also necessary that the white people not be free to move away&hellip;.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole problem. You can&rsquo;t have &lsquo;black-a-block&rsquo; integration and freedom of association at the same time. If too many whites move out and too many blacks move in, it creates a chain reaction and the whole perfect planned community falls apart. Voila! You now have a ghetto.</p>

		<p>Greetings from Ireland -</p>
<p>Just to clarify a few things. </p>
<p>@rhg #12, and others - A &#8216;mayor&rsquo; in an Irish town is not a politically powerful person like the mayor of New York, it&rsquo;s more a ceremonial thing. In a town like Ennis (pop. c.25,000) that amounts to very little one way or another.</p>
<p>Ludwig @ #25 made me laugh, though there&rsquo;s something in what he/she says there.</p>
<p>Likewise @ #37, Eric the Red makes interesting points, BUT the assertion that &#8221;The inner core of the Political Class were Marxists right from the begining&#8221; is really one of the most ludicrous things I&rsquo;ve ever read. Utter nonsense.</p>
<p>I think people accuse our political &#8221;leaders&#8221; (and they are a despicable shower)of betraying us, but that credits them with much more power than they actually have in the situation. I believe that these matters are dictated to us at the European level (where PC insanity has a long pedigree) on the basis that &#8221;we gave you all that grant and development aid, now you take your share&#8221;. Add to that the difficulty of sharing a border with the UK where PC madness is completely off the scale altogether.</p>
<p>We are not the masters of our own destiny - that is the crucial point. You only need to look at the Lisbon Treaty re-run of the referendum to see that. We are being told that we will suffer at the hands of the other members of the club, if we do not give the &#8221;correct decision&#8221; this time. A power elite that will do that, will not have hesitated to make us &#8221;take our share&#8221; of welfare immigrants. </p>

<p>Well, this is the first instantaneous and intuitive thought in my head to begin with too! And the fact that there is a concern not to clump blacks would seem to suggest that clumping has already occurred? The &#8220;ghetto&#8221; is already a fact of live in IRELAND??</p>
<p>Too, the Irish have a fascination with American blacks??!! This is only on THEIR side of the Atlantic. The Irish in America and American blacks have almost forever been bitter rivals and ethnic enemies, ready to go to blows at a moments notice, and doing so with real murderous intent on several occasions, i.e., the Draft Riots, NYC, and the Chicago Riots, 1919.</p>

<p>You make a good point. Ireland fought to be free of London&rsquo;s grasp only to embrace that of Brussell&rsquo;s. The E.U. elites want non-White immigration precisely to break up nationalistic impulses in countries, &#8216;multi-cult&rsquo; them all and thus make it easier to rule over them. Divide and conquer. At least your previous English overlords let your island remain racially homogeneous.</p>
