<h1>Africentric School Sees Enrolment Surge</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate Hammer, Globe and Mail (Toronto), September 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dressed in tiny green and orange African-print vests, nearly 115 students started their first day at the Africentric Alternative School yesterday near Sheppard Avenue West and Jane Street.</p>
<p>As they sat cross-legged on the gymnasium floor at their first morning assembly, the students represented a victory for proponents of the controversial school, which had only 85 students enrolled as recently as last Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always felt it would be ideal to start the school year with 100 students, as students come and go throughout the year,&#8221; said Toronto District School Board trustee James Pasternak, one of the school&rsquo;s most vocal supporters. &#8220;We certainly have surpassed that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last minute surge in enrolment was mostly among the younger grades, especially the junior and senior kindergarten classes, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the pathway, it gives the school a built-in flow of students into the early grades.&#8221;</p>
<p>A traditional West African drum troupe played at the opening assembly, and students, parents and teachers sang both the Canadian national anthem and Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing, also known as the black national anthem.</p>
<p>Maryann Scott enrolled her two youngest children, a son who started junior kindergarten, and a daughter who started Grade 4 yesterday. Ms. Scott has two teenaged children who went through the public school system. &#8220;It failed them, and I knew right away this would be a good thing for my younger two,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s important that students know their history, and can learn about [black] leaders,&#8221; said Osbourne Wellington, whose 3-year-old son, Darius, is starting junior kindergarten at the school today. &#8220;Then they&rsquo;ll know that they can dream bigger, that they can be more than basketball players.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I can all but guarantee that one of this school&rsquo;s students will commit a (perhaps brutal) hate crime against a white person, based on the hate and agitprop that will be instilled into him during his time at this school.</p>
<p>Just so you will be able to refute the many lies that will be told at this school:</p>

<p>How long before this school becomes mired in corruption and problems associated with blacks in charge? As if knowing some entirely forgettable African history is going to prepare these students for the competitive world they will face. I bet most asian and white parents would be hysterical with laughter if they were shown the curriculum. These kind of schools are a waste of taxpayers money.</p>

		<p>This is a taxpayer supported school.  We, of course, are never permitted to have a Eurocentric taxpayer funded school.  Even an entirely private school that was explicitly pro-white would be hounded mercilessly by the press, subjected to lawsuits, and forced to accept mandatory racial integration.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a sad time for liberals in Toronto. They were going to take an all white city and turn it into a multi-racial paragon for the whole world. Things didn&rsquo;t turn out the way they were supposed to. Blacks are an endless source of problems and all that&rsquo;s left is to try segregated schooling.</p>
<p>During the debates that led up to starting the school we were told to think of it as an experiment. If it doesn&rsquo;t produce results then it can be disbanded. Liberals buy that but thinking people can see that excuses will always be found to continue the school. Like; the school has only started to go up the learning curve or, the board of education hasn&rsquo;t given enough power to the school or, the school is only one part of an overall weakened black community. If those fail just call critics racists and that will end any effort to close the school.</p>
<p>Looking forward we can expect a growing number of black schools with a black board of education in Toronto. The pattern will be repeated across Canada. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Muslims, Chinese and other groups ask for the same thing. Whites will be the last group to try to join the bandwagon. </p>

<p>Exactly! They should be aware that they can make it into the NFL!</p>
<p>What a joke. All those little hissy-fits about how separate-but-equal is still unequal, and now they are demanding it since integration into . It&rsquo;s racist to keep them out of White schools, but the White schools are racist by not teaching Afrocentric fantasies as history. One of my favorite links (https://tinyurl.com/invmyth) exemplifies these fantasies: Heresy without the slightest hint of evidence. No wonder why I swore to home-school in the event that I have kids.</p>
<p>Not to beat a dead horse here, but Whites just can&rsquo;t win against black supremacy, as black supremacists never think it&rsquo;s enough and liberals never think enough can be done. Long story short: We&rsquo;re screwed.</p>

If it takes a sizable number of blacks out of schools that whites attend, I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>
<p>Fewer blacks means a better learning environment for whites.</p>
<p>This is one experiment to watch. Will blacks do better, even marginally? Will separate schools inspire greater separation? Will blacks discover they&rsquo;re happier being in black schools?</p>
<p>There are many unpredictable outcomes. If blacks do better, maybe we&rsquo;ll have voluntary self-segregation. If blacks do worse, who knows what new and dangerous social theories they&rsquo;ll come up with to explain the failure and insane programs to fix problems that can&rsquo;t be fixed.</p>

		<p>It will be interesting to watch this place and chart their course over the years. If they start with 100 students, how many will drop out before the end of the years? Before graduation? How many girls will bear children out of wedlock? How many will drop out to sell and/or buy junk? How many will OD? How many will be arrested for violent crime? Of those arrested, how many will beat the wrap? Of those that stay in school, how many will place high in achievment tests? If they fail, who will they blame?</p>
<p>And how many schools will be forced to include fiction about African civilizations in their cirriculua? And how many colleges and universities?</p>
<p>This whole fixation on race gets crazier by the day. </p>

		<p>I say Amen to this idea. All blacks should be so lucky as to go to such schools. The only schools for black kids in DC that work are Muslim academies where racial pride and morality are taught. Every black kid on this continent should have black teachers, black principals,all black classmates, and Afro-Centirc class work. It will be good for them and wonderous for us. Our Sat scores will skyrocket, our girls raped in bathrooms stats plummet, our kids will be able to spend their lunch money rather than have it beat out of them by 17 year old classmates in the 7th grade. Free at last, free at last, they will be free of us and us free of them at last.<br>

		<p>I hope they teach true black history in those schools, such as the fact that African tribes sold other captured Africans into slavery to the Portuguese and that slavery exists today on the dark continent. I hope they delve into the abject failure of the country of Liberia, which this country spent millions to create for the benefit of freed slaves. Not to mention the billions we pour into Africa every year, only to see it evaporate and end up in the Swiss bank accounts of tinpot dictators. I hope they examine the thoroughly dysfunctional black-run countries like Nigeria, whose primary income is from email scams, and Somalia, whose primary income is from, of all things, piracy, and Zimbabwe, the former breadbasket and net exporter of food and now the basket case of Africa due to mismanagement and revenge against whitey. I hope they discuss the terrible price our society has paid for hundreds of years of bad conduct and irresponsibility of many blacks in this country, including crime, illiteracy, illegitimate children, welfare cheats, drugs, etc., etc. <br>
I think what they will concentrate on, however, is that whitey is behind every failure in their lives and their mission is to exact revenge and become as much of a burden to the system as possible. That kind of education does not prepare them to become productive members of society.</p>

<p>Even in Canada they sing this song? Even in Canada? I think a lot of white Americans, almost all white Americans for that matter, find it amazing that there is even a substantial presence in Canada of black folks. I know that there have been black folks in Canada ever since the days of the &#8220;Underground Railroad&#8221; and all that, but not substantial numbers of disaffected and aggrieved blacks that feel that &#8220;something must be done&#8221; to ease their &#8220;plight&#8221;. What exactly is the &#8220;beef&#8221; of black folks in Canada again? Learning how to count in Swahili [1-2-3-many] really prepares you for the modern world too!</p>

<p>I have the feeling that will be one of many words these &#8220;students&#8221; will be unable to spell. I&rsquo;m sorry but academic achievement is not something i would associate with these schools. Put another way, if an Asian/white school and an afri-centric school were to compete against one another on say, for example, a complicated science project, there would be no contest. the blacks would yell &#8220;Dat projeck  be raciss&#8221; because they would not understand what was required. end of story.</p>

<p>There is a huge black population in Toronto. Selecting only 100 clever students from that amount won&rsquo;t be a problem as I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be given extra resources and places in higher education by government to help prove that blacks, left to their own devices, can be academically successful. It&rsquo;s easy to be successful with 100 hand-picked kids but it proves nothing. Whites will still be left with the deadbeats.</p>

Blacks don&rsquo;t HAVE a history in Canada, revisionism notwithstanding. Funny how blacks want to learn about &#8220;their&#8221; history by immigrating to a WHITE country. They are completely shameless.</p>

What black leaders? In a Canadian context they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>3)<br>
I very much doubt it. Athletics and entertainment. That&rsquo;s all blacks have. That&rsquo;s all they will EVER have. They don&rsquo;t have the I.Q. levels, temperment or character for anything else. Look at America or Brazil with a huge and historic black community. Look how many successful blacks come from only those two narrow categories. </p>

		<p>Toronto&rsquo;s black invasion started shortly after 1965 when Canada&rsquo;s Liberal Party changed our immigration laws (just like Teddy Kennedy did in the U.S.) in order to bring in loads of Third Worlders who would then vote Liberal.   Toronto received large numbers of Caribbean and African blacks, Montreal got Haitians and Vancouver on the Pacific Coast got a huge influx of Chinese and East Indians.   In order to keep them all happy, succesive Liberal governments have instituted Official Multiculturalism to show Whitey that he no longer rules the roost and Human Rights Commissions staffed with Third Worlders who have the power to levy fines or imprisonment on anyone saying or printing anything which might cause offense to our &#8220;new citizens&#8221;.   The Afrocentric school in Toronto is just the latest step in our downward spiral.</p>

		<p>Sounds like a good idea. When do the first Eurocentric schools open here in the USA?</p>

		<p>The loudest voices in Canada condemning segregated schooling comes from rabid leftist white multiculturalists.  </p>
<p>Most of them believe in racial harmony the way a child believes in a Santa Claus he&rsquo;s never seen.  </p>
<p>Any information contradicting the existence of things in their imaginary world is met with vehement protest. </p>

		<p>And what was it that Newsweek whiteholocaust deniers had to say :&hellip;the thought of white kids having pride in their race was sickening.  Enough said.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got an idea. All these blacks that are so convinced that they have a history and the potential for being a lasting and intelligent society should really just stop relying on Whitey&rsquo;s taxpayer money and go to Africa and try to gain a foothold there, instead of vehemently pursuing White women and bashing White people. How hard is that? I love these idiots that claim black supremacy but will fawn over the next White woman to come along. </p>

		<p>All Blacks should go to Afrocentric Schools with other Blacks. What they learn is of no concern to me. We had this at one time and it was simply known as segregation.</p>
<p>White Schools for Whites and Black Schools for Blacks. White teachers for Whites and Black teachers for Blacks.  Blacks learn about African History and the other the students learn about real history. </p>
