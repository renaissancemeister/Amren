<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSTRE5885PM20090909">Pigeon Transfers Data Faster Than South Africa&rsquo;s Telkom</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, September 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A South African information technology company on Wednesday proved it was faster for them to transmit data with a carrier pigeon than to send it using Telkom, the country&rsquo;s leading internet service provider.</p>
<p>Internet speed and connectivity in Africa&rsquo;s largest economy are poor because of a bandwidth shortage. It is also expensive.</p>
<p>Local news agency SAPA reported the 11-month-old pigeon, Winston, took one hour and eight minutes to fly the 80 km (50 miles) from Unlimited IT&rsquo;s offices near Pietermaritzburg to the coastal city of Durban with a data card was strapped to his leg.</p>
<p>Including downloading, the transfer took two hours, six minutes and 57 seconds  &mdash;  the time it took for only four percent of the data to be transferred using a Telkom line.</p>

<p>Now we know why the black terrorist government in ZA wants to keep their whites as essentially inmates.  The reason is they need someone there to make things work.</p>
<p>The whole reason for this is that ZA is hosting the 2010 Soccer World Cup, which is the world&rsquo;s biggest and most watched sporting event.  They need to get the broadband speed up within the country and to other countries from ZA, in order to accommodate the media.</p>

		<p>The main reason is that the supplier, Telkom, has been hijacked by BEE( Black Economic Empowerment ), and there&rsquo;s too much money at stake for blacks to do anything about a product that they view as white.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to all previously successful state entities that have been wrecked and ruined by AA and BEE, i.e. SA Airways, Escom (elec supplier), education, health, policing, security, the military etc etc. Whites joke that the only gov department that works is the Revenue Services, where whites&rsquo; money are taken and the workforce is mainly white women.</p>
<p>PS - in a country where whites are being exterminated, is this the best article AMREN could come up with ?</p>

		<p>I always figured they would spare the Whites in the telecommunications field. From what I understand, the internet/e-mail is an African&rsquo;s meal ticket.</p>
<p>The pathetic part is that blacks will never realize that Whites (or any other race besides their own, really) equal productivity. They will continue demanding monetary hand-outs from western civilization while simultaneously slaughtering those capable of using the money effectively.</p>
<p>I see Africa plummeting back to it&rsquo;s pre-colonial days, only this time the tribal chiefs live in billion-dollar mansions.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity is quite correct;  the South African government has guaranteed sufficient data transmission capacity for the broadcast of the 2010 WOrld Cup matches.  That capacity doesn&rsquo;t exist.  At the time the undertaking was given, it was polanned to lay a new undersea cable up the east coast of Africa to Europe, in a joint venture with Tanzania.  That project never got off the ground.</p>
<p>There is not a hope in hades that the required bandwidth will be available.  This is only one of the disasters that were entirely predictable from the start.  I had a chuckle a few weeks ago when visiting Cape Town. The streets in the central city have been dug up for several hundred yards to a depth of about two feet.  Above the excavation, on every lamp post, flutters a banner with the legend &#8220;South Africa: Ready to Welcome the World&#8221;.  The rest of that joke is, even if they should complete the planned roadworks in time, the plan is fatally flawed.  As I hear it, they forgot to take the buses into account.</p>
<p>I have no sympathy for FIFA (football governing body). All of this was foreseeable from the start. I&rsquo;ll make a few more predictions. Transport will be chaotic.  The minibus taxi drivers WILL blockade the streets; it&rsquo;s a perfect opportunity to blackmail the government. Crime will go through the roof. Tourists are like manna from heaven; naive, unarmed, probably drunk, loaded with cash and, in the unlikely event that the police should accidentally arrest a mugger, won&rsquo;t be around to give evidence in court.</p>
<p>If they actually try to hold the world cup in SA, they deserve everything they&rsquo;re going to get.  I plan to watch the farce from another country.  So should you.</p>

		<p>did anyone see their attempt at a space program?  it was an oversized estees rocket that exploded on the launch pad.  it was a televised event that was attended by the biggest leaders in the country.  it was considered a huge success by them.  i&rsquo;m dead serious.  here&rsquo;s the link:</p>

I dunno - I found it cute. The enthusiasm was infectious.<br>
It´s obviously a humorous piece, and as such not badly done.</p>
<p>Yes, a little self-irony like that would fit the South Africans well &hellip; as it would behoove us not to forget that Valier (who used kitchen scales to measure thrust), Oberth or Goddard (who in his lifetime was the laughingstock of engineerdom) did not start out too differently (though their contraptions were not so clearly made out of stovepipes).<br>
Anyways, poor rodent &hellip; (g)</p>

<p>THREADJACK   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m starting to think that FIFA&rsquo;s Sepp Blatter was trying to <b>turn the spotlight back on SA to highlight the deterioration of the country</b> and to make them think twice about Operation Uhuru (i.e., the final genocide of the whites) in case Mandela died during the interim.  If that&rsquo;s true, he did a bold and strategic act of heroism for Afrikaaners.<br>

		<p>To concernicus and nokangaroos:</p>
<p>I saw the link you posted concernicus, and I was amused. Only in Africa would an abject failure like that be considered a rousing success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congolese space program&#8221; - an oxymoron if I ever heard one. It belongs right up there with &#8220;Jamaican bobsled team&#8221;, or &#8220;Nigerian ice hockey team&#8221;.</p>
<p>Question - just where were those Congolese &#8220;engineers&#8221; educated?</p>

		<p>I wonder if we will ever see the true crime statistics for the world cup in SA. We have never seen them for the Katrina thing, though I have personal insight to what happened there.</p>
