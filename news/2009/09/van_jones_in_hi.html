<h1>Van Jones, in His Own Words</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Glenn Beck, FOX News, September 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>We&rsquo;re going to take another look at our new green jobs &#8220;czar,&#8221; or special adviser to the president for green jobs or whatever they want to call him. But what I want to do is to really take a good, hard look at who Van Jones is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve told you for the last couple months now, that Jones is an avowed, radical, revolutionary communist. In the last few days, the left has been trying to scrub his image clean  &mdash;  to the point where they are now claiming that he has totally transformed into a raging capitalist. All of a sudden, he&rsquo;s a combination of Bill Gates and J. Paul Getty. He&rsquo;s mainstream now; the perfect, young go-getting entrepreneur to kick job creation into high gear. All he wants to do is create green jobs, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>I hate to intrude with the facts here, but let&rsquo;s look at Van Jones&rsquo; own words. Now granted, we have to go way back here  &mdash;  I mean, I don&rsquo;t even know how old President Barack Obama was when this event happened  &mdash;  it was clear back before April of this year.</p>
<p>I know, we have to go all the way back to this past March, to the Power Shift &#8216;09 conference  &mdash;  right before Jones was appointed as our president&rsquo;s &#8220;special adviser&#8221;  &mdash;  when he said this:</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>VAN JONES: This movement is deeper than a solar panel! Deeper than a solar panel! Don&rsquo;t stop there! Don&rsquo;t stop there! We&rsquo;re gonna change the whole system! We&rsquo;re gonna change the whole thing. We&rsquo;re not gonna put a new battery in a broken system. We want a new system. We want a new system!</p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But this goes further than whether Van Jones is a capitalist or a communist. Look at what else Jones said at this conference:</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>JONES: And our Native American sisters and brothers who were pushed and bullied and mistreated and shoved into all the land we didn&rsquo;t want, where it was all hot and windy. Well, guess what? Renewable energy? Guess what, solar industry? Guess what wind industry? They now own and control 80 percent of the renewable energy resources. No more broken treaties. No more broken treaties. Give them the wealth! Give them the wealth! Give them the dignity. Give them the respect that they deserve. No justice on stolen land. We owe them a debt.</p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>Give them the wealth? Is that what you voted for?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No? Let&rsquo;s try it again. Here&rsquo;s more from Van Jones  &mdash;  again, to be fair, this is from his &#8220;ancient history catalogue&#8221;  &mdash;  this past March:</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>JONES: What about our immigrant sisters and brothers? What about our immigrant sisters and brothers? What about people who come here from all around the world who we&rsquo;re willing to have out in the field, with poison being sprayed on them, poison being sprayed on them because we have the wrong agricultural system. And we&rsquo;re willing to poison them and poison the earth to put food on our table, but we don&rsquo;t want to give them rights and we don&rsquo;t want to give them dignity and we don&rsquo;t want to give them respect?</p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to give them rights? We&rsquo;re poisoning immigrants? Who is &#8220;we&#8221;? This was from an interview he did as head of the Ella Baker Center:</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>JONES: We&rsquo;re really entering a third wave of environmentalism in the United States.</p>
<p>The white polluters and the white environmentalists are essentially steering poison into the people of color communities.</p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>This only proves that green is the new red.</p>
<p>I wonder what Van Jones has to say about blacks that yank their thermostats to insanely high temperatures in the winter, thereby increasing the use of natural gas and the cost for everybody.  I wonder what Van Jones thinks about the non-stop parade of &#8220;hooptees&#8221; that blacks and Hispanics like to drive.  They have thousands for those gawdy retro spinning chrome wheels, but not one dime for pollution maintenance.</p>

		<p>I do agree that if the Native Americans find ways to exploit the renewable energy resources they have, that of course they should be able to profit from it. However, I don&rsquo;t see how &#8220;white environmentalists&#8221; or &#8220;white polluters&#8221; (apparently the same people) are steering poisons into communities of color. Jones does not explain. The thing that bugs me most about people who were appointed to government positions, be they white or black or Latino or whatever is that they believe themselves to be infallible. Of course it&rsquo;s &#8220;white environmentalists poisoning minorities&#8221;! Van Jones said it didn&rsquo;t he? We all heard it straight from the mouth of God. </p>

		<p>Knowing what I do, that enviromentalism is now  just another  White Guilt  con, like zero-population growth, I have a new policy. I let the shaving water run forever till it`s nice and hot. The benefits? A closer shave AND I leave the house patting myself on the back like Newkirk and Lebeau after a successful sabotage mission on Hogan`s Heroes.</p>

		<p>Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be politically advantageous to Mr. Van Jones&rsquo; to admit that maybe, <i>just</i> maybe (I know, I&rsquo;m trailblazing here) importing millions of hyper-fertile over-consuming Third Worlders wasn&rsquo;t, and isn&rsquo;t, such a good idea for the environment?</p>
<p>God I feel bad for the U.S. whites that have to put up with the  number of unaccountable, anti-white Diversocrats that Obama is increasingly appointing to high positions but there&rsquo;s one good point - the growing anti-white nature of the U.S. of Obama might awaken more whites after all </p>

		<p>  Understanding ecology is very complicated.  Solutions need to be based on science and not emotion.  Hence is it essential that those who lead &#8220;scientific&#8221; commissions and departments actually have been trained in and understand the difficult science behind the problems, and not be selected on just skin color.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that the Obama administration would only choose distinguished scientists   &mdash;   people who have worked and studied in the fields their entire lives   &mdash;   for such important positions.  As such, I would be interested to know from which biology, ecology, or agricultural department Jones received his Ph.D. Also, what was the subject of his Ph.D. Dissertation?  Was it on photovoltaic cells?  I&rsquo;d like to also read his science-journal articles on various conservation and ecology topics.</p>

		<p>Obama was the most left wing member of the senate, and now we&rsquo;re stuck with him for more than 3 more years.  I knew all along that he&rsquo;d give us horrors like Sotomayer and Van Jones.  I wonder how all the white environmentalists who voted for Obama feel about being accused of steering poison into people of color communities?</p>
<p>I lay the blame for this disaster on Bush and the idiot Republican Party which gave us another neocon, John McCain, as their candidate.  They did everything they could to guarantee that a Democrat would win.  The only Republican candidate who would have had a chance was the one the Republican Party hates, Ron Paul.</p>

		<p>This guy is not an environmental expert by any stretch.  He was not concerned with the environment. He is not a scientist.  </p>
<p>He is a typical black radical now with a taxpayer job to overlook the environment.</p>
<p>The real environmentalists should be mad as hell, and every taxpayer should be furious at this example of government waste.</p>

I&rsquo;m all for clean water, clean air, pesticide free food etc.</p>
<p>The problem with these people is that they believe technologies already exist that can transform the world over night and that the only reason we&rsquo;re not using them is because &#8216;white corporate powers&rsquo; are keeping these technologies off the market.</p>
<p>We need consistent, reliable energy. Even with the best solar cells, the sun doesn&rsquo;t always shine (and that&rsquo;s just daylight hours). You can have arces of wind turbines but the wind doesn&rsquo;t always blow. Electric cars need a source of electricity.</p>
<p>None of these alternative energies currently possess the efficiency and reliability that these people seem to believe they do.</p>
<p>These people don&rsquo;t seem to grasp basic science let alone higher physics.</p>
<p>If the leftist believe free energy (energy created without cost or pollution) is a reality let them give us the technologies right now.</p>
<p>I would love to have something green that gave me free energy. The problem is it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>What was it the professor said?  &#8220;We are under intense pressure to pass X number of blacks, and if we don&rsquo;t we are called forth and forced to answer for it.&#8221;</p>

About a year ago I posted my policy:  I use as much resources as I can, all the time.  I leave lights on all over my huge house, I run the AC in the summer non-stop, I run the heat up HIGH all winter, I water the hell out of my lawn all summer, take looooooong showers, and I burn as much gas as I can.  <br/>

		<p>This is an extremely dangerous man, a hardcore racist, and an arrogant one at that; an avowed communist with such affinity for Muslims that he named his children after them, who is being put in a powerful, and easily &#8216;flying under the radar&rsquo; position. It&rsquo;s a very lethal combination. Obama is loading up the administration with like people, making obscene numbers unadvertised policies &amp; connections that are diabolically concealed from the U.S. citizens; all designed to re-make America. </p>

<p>There are people who do the dissertations, and people who write the  articles&hellip;and then there are people who put their plans into motion.  Rarely are they the same  people, it&rsquo;s been that way since the beginning of time my friend. </p>
<p>Mr. Jones is a lawyer, which is exactly what i&rsquo;d expect he&rsquo;d be.  Rush Limbaugh, for example, is considered the the face of Republican politics, but he does not even have a college degree much less a PHD in Political Science or International Studies.</p>

<p>Obama was trained to hide is hatred of the white people, he is no different from Van Jones and the other blacks that rule America.</p>
<p>Biden seems to be an idiot, all liberals in my opinion, as a non American, are insane.</p>
<p>In a sane and healthy nation, no one would even consider to vote blacks into power.</p>
<p>I guess the brainwashing was very successful in America.</p>

		<p>Why is Van Jones considered an enviromentalist since he is a cheerleader for importing high fertility hispanics,asians,muslims and africans? Here is what I would ask Van Jones:Mr. Jones, Do think Native Born White Americans should have large families? Van Jones:No. Jupiter:Why not? You are in favor of importing high fertility asians,hispanics,muslims and africans, therefore you are in favor of rapid population growth within the United States. Van Jones:People of Color..Whites are racists..genocide!!!! Jupiter:Are you in favor of Native Born White Americans having large families? Van Jones:People of Color..its their turn..Native Americans Genocide!!!!Jupiter:There were many genocides and exterminations within Ameridian societies both in North America and South America. And don&rsquo;t forget the role of Africans in selling their brethren into slavery. Now Mr Jones, why are you opposed to Native Born Americans having large families? Van Jones:White people are racists!!!! Mr. Jones you are accusing Native Born White Americans of being racists because they have a prefernce for their own kind..just like asians,hispanics,muslims and africans do and just like yu do&hellip;so by your definition everyone is a racist. Van Jones:people of color..Whites are racists. Jupiter:Why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of importing high fetility non-whites which would result in Native Born Whie Americans becomming a ever dwindling racial minority and economically marginalized? Why should they be in favor of this? Van Jones:silence Jupiter:Mr. Jones, you like the anti-white kenyan bigot you work for, harbor malignant intent towards the Native Born White majority. You and the anti-white kenyan bigot you work for can not give Native Born White Americans any good reason to support the continuation of post-1965 immigration policy so you should be shocked that Native Born White Americans-an increasing number of them every year-strongly oppose their race-replacement at the hands of high-fertility asians,hispanics,africans and muslims. Their are irrecociliable differences between Native Born White Americans and post-1965 high fertility non-whites,africans,muslims and africans.</p>
<p>This is how you deal with a black racialist and fake environmentalist. Memorize the script. It will work everh time. Expose thier true intentions towards Native Born White Americans.</p>

		<p>There is a very low level of environmental conciousness among Native Born White Americans.This is a major reason why game of race-replacement continues-not the only reason.</p>
<p>You can either get very emotional about protecting the environment,endangered species,forests,open and the envrironmental amenities or you can get emotional and worked up about A-Rod, Jeter and Da Yankees. You can&rsquo;t do both. There isn&rsquo;t enough energy and time in the day to do both. It is more sane to emotionally invest in a very deep and profound way with Nature than to be a jock sniffing, couch potato sports fan.</p>
<p>When one connects with Nature in an emotinally profund way, it his one smack in the face that high fertility asians,hispanics,muslims and africans are the number one threat to the realm of Nature that exists within the borders of OUR AMERICA. Post-1965 non-whites are here in OUR AMERICA!!! to expand,expand,expand and expand&hellip;they are the force of run away population growth that will destroy the profound and glorious natural beauty of OUR AMERICA!!!!. Nothing could be more obvious. The passage of Amnesty-which is inevitable because of the exponentially growing demographic clout of high fertility asians,muslims,hispanics and africans-will push the US population past one billion in&hellip;.25 years!!! When this happens the White Guys attetnding fantasy football drafts-you mean the actual thing isn&rsquo;t enough to satify the addiction-will wake one day..but it will it will be too late.</p>
<p>White Nationaist are the real environmentalist. They are the only envrinmentalist in America.</p>

You don&rsquo;t make a whole lot of sense. If you are trying to justify Jones&rsquo; lack of qualifications, you failed. </p>
<p>He did not.</p>

		<p>&#8220;JONES: And our Native American sisters and brothers who were pushed and bullied and mistreated and shoved into all the land we didn&rsquo;t want, where it was all hot and windy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Native American sisters and brothers?&#8221;  And his Hispanic sisters and brothers?  And ALL his non-white sisters and brothers?  All people of color?  Under one umbrella, combined as a force multiplier against whitey?  </p>
<p>One third of the population.  Otherwise it would only be one eighth if he and his bros were standing alone.</p>
<p>He is using old fashioned 60&rsquo;s propaganda to try to give the appearance that it is whites against all the minorities, when the fact of the matter is that, generally, the other races want nothing to do with blacks.  The Hispanics fight them in schools and neighborhoods ALL OVER the country, but especially in California where the L.A. County Sheriff, Lee Baca, admits that they are having a race war and it has very little to do with gangs.</p>
<p>Asians, for the most part, are absolutely appalled with blacks and avoid them if at all possible.  When they can&rsquo;t, as horror stories from Asians have described, they are bullied and harassed at every turn until they move and go to different schools.</p>
<p>Every other race feels pretty much the same way, so I would like to let Van the Man know that his psychological methods are a bit stupid since the people he declares are on his side really are sickened by him and his people, so I&rsquo;m almost embarassed for him as he tries to use such ignorant psyching methods.  But, I&rsquo;m not surprised, because I&rsquo;ve watched a lot of his tapes, and he&rsquo;s somewhat of the usual black dunce.  It&rsquo;s a disgrace for Yale that they gave him certification under obvious affirmative action quotas.  Yale and Harvard both are getting some pretty bad PR for graduating morons.</p>
<p>But, this guy Jones is of the same caliber, intent and make-up as Jeremiah Wright and Louis Farrakhan.  He&rsquo;s a mentally challenged racist black that despises whites, exactly the type that has rubbed shoulders with Obama for 20 plus years in Chicago.  Doesn&rsquo;t that have something to do with the saying, &#8220;Birds of a feather&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, he does have some white friends too, but I doubt any of the lefties in the media will mention that they are anarchists, revolutionaries, communists, flakes, oddballs, and misfits of the highest order.  He has a couple white acquaintences who aren&rsquo;t any of the aforementioned, however, they despise themselves just as much as they hate all whites, so he overlooks their shortcomings as revolutionaries and such and allows them to continue to be on his team.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another revolutionary type who is seeking to try to cut off all conservative broadcasters from radio and T.V.  He&rsquo;s Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;Diversity&#8221; Czar, Mark Lloyd.  If you were kind, you would investigate what he stands for and call him a black Marxist, anti-white hate monger.  I can&rsquo;t tell you what you would call him if you weren&rsquo;t kind and still get this post by the moderator, so I&rsquo;ll have to forego that for now.</p>
<p>But, all in all, this entire line up of miscreants and demagogues probable are rather tame compared to his AG, Eric Holder, who would like to put all whites in jail if he thought there was even an outside chance of getting away with it.</p>
<p>I just hope Obama keeps Van Jones, Mark Lloyd and the rest of his carnival of misfits, because he&rsquo;s raising race issues from whites in this country who would never consider doing so before he was elected, and I expect things to get a lot worse.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;In a sane and healthy nation, no one would even consider to vote blacks into power.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree.  Having these people in power, &amp; knowing that other whites put them there, is deeply disturbing.  It&rsquo;s as though the country had a death-wish, wanting to self-mutilate like those teenage girls who cut themselves with razors, but on a massive scale.  I want to wake up &amp; find it was all an ugly nightmare.</p>

		<p>Well said, Ranger #29   &mdash;   but we got rid of Van Jones, and now it&rsquo;s time to move in on Mark Lloyd.  I believe Glenn Beck was primarily responsible for Van J&rsquo;s &#8220;resignation&#8221; - you know he was asked to resign for causing so much hassle for the Party - and now if Mr. Beck and Rush and as many of us as possible flood the Red (White) House with anti-Lloyd programming, emails, etc., we&rsquo;ll hopefully get rid of him too.  One down and a lot to go - but it CAN be done!!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what green jobs are, though I can guess.  Of course he doesn&rsquo;t explain. Anyway, I do notice that since he doesn&rsquo;t have much to say, he compensates for his mental vacuity by repeating everything several times over, just to fill in the empty air.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And I have never met a black person yet, educated or not, that doesn&rsquo;t think white america has given them the bum rap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course not.  And, almost EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM that holds certification from a university or licensing board would never have been able to pass if they were not allowed a measure of favoritism in both scores and grades.</p>
<p>That is NOT an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The more whites give blacks the more blacks hate them.  And it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re envious and jealous of whites, to the point where those deplorable feelings have been intensified to out and out hatred.</p>
<p>If blacks took credit for their own inability to succeed, their huge egos couldn&rsquo;t stand living with the truth, so it&rsquo;s necessary to manufacturte hatred for whitey as the persons responsible for their lack of achievement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really as simple as that.</p>

		<p>Glen Beck hammered away at Jones and should recieve much credit for his resignation.<br/>
Whether or not Obama knew about Jones would speak volumes about the prez. If he didn&rsquo;t know Jones past and firey rhetoric, then Obama wasn&rsquo;t doing his job. If Obama DID know all about Jones, then that alone should tell YOU about our president. He hides his hate and disdain for the White race very well. And he just loves those muslims. Awaken, liberals, to what you unleashed upon this once-great nation.<br/>
