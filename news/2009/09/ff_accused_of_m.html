			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ruadhán Mac Cormaic, Irish Times, September 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>FIANNA FÁIL has reduced Irish citizenship to a &#8220;meaningless money-spinner&#8221; used by some immigrants solely as a means of exiting the immigration system, Fine Gael has claimed.</p>
<p>Calling for the publication of a Green Paper on citizenship, the party&rsquo;s spokesman on immigration and integration, Denis Naughten, said the concept had become &#8220;devoid of any value or pride&#8221; and endorsed the introduction of language and culture tests for those applying for naturalisation.</p>
<p>He pointed out that a recent decision by the Minister for Justice to impose a € 500 fee for long-term residence applications meant a citizenship application now cost just €450 more. Applicants for both citizenship and long-term residence have to prove they have been legally resident in the State for at least five years, and processing delays mean the waiting times for each application are similar.</p>
<p>This created an incentive for foreign nationals to opt for citizenship, which allowed them &#8220;avoid some of the bureaucracy and red tape in having to renew their residency and having to carry a Garda registration card at all times,&#8221; Mr Naughten said. &#8220;Irish citizenship is therefore becoming a meaningless vehicle for exiting the immigration system. It is a sad state of affairs that Irish citizenship has become devoid of any value or pride. To Fianna Fáil, it has become a meaningless money spinner and for some migrants it is just a vehicle to exit the immigration system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urging reform of the process, Mr Naughten said the naturalisation should be reached by way of a series of &#8220;stepping stones&#8221; that would encourage applicants&rsquo; social integration. These would include civics classes and tests of language competence and knowledge of Irish history and culture.</p>
<p>Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced so that new Irish citizens and their families could publicly declare their desire to integrate into Irish society, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The present system is such a mess, it is open to abuse. At present, our naturalisation rates are extremely low when compared to other countries and as a result we prevent any meaningful participation of newcomers into Irish society.&#8221; A Green Paper on citizenship would allow for an informed debate on the subject, he said.<br>

		<p>&#8220;devoid of any value or pride&#8221; Or, about as much as green Beer on March 17th.  Maybe it`s because the people getting it aren`t any more Irish than the man in the moon so  that it no longer has the value and meaning it used to. P.S. I just thought of a gag. Next time I want to fly to Canada and be refused entry, I`m gonna tell the Tamil Immigration agent, &#8220;No really!, What`s the joke?!? Whrere`s the camera? Show me the camera&hellip; I`m on TV?!? &#8216;</p>

		<p>And thus did the Irish - who fought so long, so hard against their culture, language and ethnicity being annihilated-by-assimilation into the dreaded &#8220;Anglo-Saxon&#8221; - fall, betrayed by their own leaders in the battle against the Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> Pakistanis and Nigerians want Irish culture preserved as much as the Irish do. [/sarcasm]</p>

Who cares about  &#8220;other countries&#8221; and what they do?   They are not good examples to follow.  Just because the other lemmings are all jumping off the cliff doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to imitate them.</p>

<p>FIANNA FÁIL  is Ireland&rsquo;s governing party.  It is the largest political party in the Republic of Ireland.  The name is traditionally translated into English as &#8220;Soldiers of Destiny&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Founded by Eamon de Valera and launched on 16 May 1926, Fianna Fáil emerged from a split among those in the Sinn Féin Party who rejected the Anglo-Irish  Treaty of 1921.  In 1991 it formed a coalition government with the Labour Party&hellip;  It is currently led by Brian Cowen.</p>
<p>In Ireland and the British Commonwealth, a  GREEN  PAPER is a tentative government report of a proposal without any commitment to action, the first step in changing the law. Green papers may result in the production of a  white paper.   <br>

<p>        Why would anybody in his right mind want the Irish to genetically integrate with nigerians ans pakistanis? The fact that they do not integrate in Irish society is a good thing.</p>

		<p>This is not funny.  This situation is very serious.  I fear what this means.  If the Irish are so stupid like White America and Europe to let these racist non-white people invade their lands then I fear our future.  I can not even escape the thoughts that constantly run through my mind.  Maybe it is instinctive that we ponder our future - yes - even ponder our racial future.  I have said many many times that if Europe could throw the foreigner out then America will follow suit.  We are sovereign and so are they.  And we all have seen that their is no peace and no decent future with diversity.  Tell them to stay there and de-populate to feed their own people and let us stay where we are.</p>

		<p>Of course immigration policy is a mess. It&rsquo;s been deliberately made that way to confuse the public throughout every EU country by the neo-Marxist pro-EU politicians who are well on their way to making the multicultural EU Federal Superstate irreversible through mass immigration. Ireland is a financial wreck due to the &#8221;credit crunch&#8221; &amp; come October 2 this small state will be offered inducements by the EU Marxist dictators to vote &#8221;yes&#8221; at second time of asking to the Lisbon Treaty whose ratification will further erode the sovereignty of the European nation-states (They will have further input into EU states&rsquo; immigration policies which they already largely dictate). Through the Internet many people throughout the EU are awakening to the totalitarian monster that is the EU(SSR). It&rsquo;s a race against time to win over the unenlightened between those nationalists who oppose it &amp; the corrupt neo-Marxist politicians who have long planned this USSR Mark II and are now in overdrive. Vladimir Bukovsky is a former Soviet dissident who in the 4min 35sec video below comments on the strong resemblance between the former USSR &amp; the present EU (he predicts its eventual demise too). This is your future too, USA, you are in the elementary stage of the NAU Federal State which for now is called a &#8221;Free Trade Area&#8221; or some such. Some hopes. There is much for Americans to learn from the European EU experience. The template for the North American Union is similar to that of the European Common Market thirty years ago. They suck nations in bit-by-bit until they eventually consume you. </p>

<p>&gt; I completely agree with this post.  I believe that the 800 years of oppression by the English has blinded the Irish to their own weaknesses, specifically the tendancy to identify with any group that can be parlayed as an image of an oppressed people.</p>
<p>&gt; The other sadness is that there are always those who will sell their own mother for riches.  America is full of those types.<br>

		<p>WHITEPLIGHT, please listen up!</p>
<p>For at least the last 80 years the Irish Catholics on both sides of the border have been bullied by their Church into snivelling over the supposed plight of barefoot Africans, so when - roughly a quarter-century ago - these pitiable Africans actually showed up in platoon, company and batallion strength, the Irish simply didn&rsquo;t have the guts, balls and backbone to slam the door shut.</p>
<p>I have no time to provide a link, but the half-English / half-Irish Kevin Myers [see his Wikipedia entry - or, better, please link to it] is about the only person in the country farsighted enouigh to see the threat.</p>

Thank you for that reference to Kevin Myers. I checked him out. Very interesting indeed! This is encouraging news.<br>
Yes, he seems to be a rare voice calling out in the wilderness, but predictably with a lot of resistence from the predictable sources. </p>
<p>e.g. <br>
 &#8220;Myers has been an advocate of unrestricted freedom of speech and an opponent of censorship and political correctness. He attracted considerable criticism for &#8220;An Irishman&rsquo;s Diary&#8221;, in which he referred to children of unmarried mothers as &#8220;bastards&#8221;.</p>
<p>Aid to Africa:   &#8220;Myers wrote an article arguing that providing aid to Africa only results in increasing its population, and its problems.  This produced strong reactions, with the Immigrant Council of Ireland making an official complaint alleging incitement to hatred.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is high time that the great people of Ireland stood up and proudly defended their nation.  If they rcognized a threat by the British, why do they see no wrong in having people far less compatible?  Is this a Church plot? </p>
