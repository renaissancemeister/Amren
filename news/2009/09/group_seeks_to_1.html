			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicole C. Brambila, Desert Sun (Palm Springs, California), September 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Families with mixed legal status  &mdash;  such as the Jaramillos  &mdash;  are one of many complications created by the nation&rsquo;s broken immigration policies that fuel divisive debate over reform, say researchers at the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research center in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>And anti-immigration advocates aren&rsquo;t waiting for President Barack Obama&rsquo;s promised overhaul.</p>
<p>Local supporters are collecting signatures for a proposed California initiative that would require that birth certificates be stamped &#8220;foreign&#8221; for U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants  &mdash;  a tactic designed to limit the state benefits they receive.</p>
<p>They want it on the ballot next year.</p>
<p>The proposed measure is hailed by supporters as a way to rein in state spending by discouraging immigrants from having what they dub &#8220;anchor babies,&#8221; a derogatory term for U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants that give the family a foothold in the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents call the initiative xenophobic and racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Access to services</b></p>
<p>Undocumented immigrants can receive assistance for their U.S.-born, dependent children, even though they themselves do not qualify for these programs.</p>
<p>The proposed initiative would change that.</p>
<p>Only qualifying participants would be able to claim benefits for their children. So the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants, while citizens, would no longer qualify for social services.</p>
<p>If passed, the proposed initiative would:</p>
<p>Eliminate cash assistance through CalWORKs, a state welfare program for needy California families.</p>
<p>Require that parents sign an affidavit declaring their U.S. citizenship or lawful presence in the country.</p>
<p>Compel counties to issue two types of birth certificates.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it would work:</p>
<p>Before receiving a U.S. birth certificate for her child, a non-citizen would be required to submit an affidavit declaring her lawful presence in the country. She would also have to declare her country of origin, means of financial support, and provide a photo and fingerprint, along with $75.</p>
<p>The child&rsquo;s birth certificate would then be stamped: &#8220;foreign.&#8221;</p>
<p>The county would then submit the information to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens, too, would be required to submit an affidavit declaring their citizenship.</p>
<p>At this time, U.S. citizens  &mdash;  regardless of their parents&rsquo; legal status  &mdash;  are eligible for social services.</p>
<p><b>Sentiment not new</b></p>
<p>The measure requires 433,971 signatures to be placed on the June 2009 ballot.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tight economic times fan an anti-immigrant sentiment, state historians say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Unconstitutional?</b></p>
<p>Legal scholars, historians and Hilton expect a legal challenge to this initiative as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the initiative goes against the grain of the 14th Amendment and is unconstitutional,&#8221; said Armando Navarro, a UC Riverside political science professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a manifestation of the increasing racism that is beginning to again accelerate.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We created a window for those crazy right-winger types to come up with this type of initiative because there&rsquo;s a vacuum.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This proposed initiative would only serve to fan the flames against the undocumented, local advocates say.</p>
<p>Issuing a separate birth certificate, they say, could lead to harassment at best or secondary citizenry at worse.</p>

		<p>A great idea that will be suffocated in the federal courts. Anchor babies have rights under current judicial interpretation. One can argue the opposite, and many do, including some members of Congress. But basically the liberal bent of most federal judges and the control by radicals of the White House means judges for a while will do what it takes to throw money at the brats of the illegals.</p>

		<p>This is a difficult thing to do.  I do believe it says in the constitution that anyone born on US soil is a citizen(I may be wrong.)  But considering that&rsquo;s the law of the land it must be adheared to.  However these people are using the law as a sword to serve their own selfish purposes.  From my law classes I remember that the law is a shield not a sword and anyone using it as a sword is therefore knowingly breaking the law nullifying that law in their case.  The parents should be deported and we all know that children should be raised by their parents.</p>

		<p>For groups like the Pew Hispanic Center to claim that the immigration system is &#8220;broken&#8221; is somewhat akin to Democrats who get caught in campaign finance scandals genuflecting by saying that the American campaign funding system is &#8220;broken.&#8221;  They&rsquo;re the ones that broke it.</p>

In the discussion of the anchor baby never do you see mentioned that the baby by a mexican citizen born in the US has also the right to Mexican passport! <br>
The anchor babies almost all have two passports!</p>

Actually, the 14th Amendment was to give citizenship only to blacks. There were conversations during the making of the Amendment which specifically stated that it does NOT give citizenship to the children of immigrants who just happen to be in our country when they have their child. Our liberal judges reinterpreted the Constitution to allow citizenship. The fact be known, we don&rsquo;t have 20 million illegals, but closer to 50 million if you count their spawn.<br>

<p>Yes, the 14th amendment does say anyone born on U.S. soil is a U.S citizen, but it&rsquo;s purpose was to make citizens of the ex-slaves. Too bad they didn&rsquo;t spell out exactly its purpose when they wrote the amendment. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s nice that the author trots out a hate-filled racist (Armando Navarro) as an expert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, what this means is a transfer of power, it means control, it means who&rsquo;s going to influence. And it is the young people, the people who are now moving to develop an agenda for the twenty first century. They are really going to be in a position to really make the promise of what the Chicano movement was all about in terms of self-determination, in terms of empowerment, and even in the terms of the idea of an Aztlan! &#8220;</p>

		<p>Good luck with that. We passed a ballot measure, prop 187 in 1994, to limit illegal alien access to government programs. It was defeated in court simply because Gray Davis (who was recalled in 2003) failed to execute the will of the (then) people of California. Now we have america&rsquo;s short future: a babyless, ageing White population more concerned with fashionable lifestyles and massive <br>
debt, not to mention a Marxist value set. <br>
This measure will easily go down since California&rsquo;s  White population is old and shrinking and has been a minority for 20 years. Look at California and look at america&rsquo;s future.</p>

		<p>The Fourteenth Amendment is misinterpreted to mean that the children of illegal aliens are citizens, but it was never intended that way. It was written to ensure freed slaves secured citizenship. The key to understanding the following sentence from the amendment &hellip; </p>
<p>&ldquo;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip; is the phrase &ldquo;subject to the jurisdiction thereof.&rdquo; Mexican citizens are subject to the jurisdiction of Mexico, and their children do have automatic citizenship: of Mexico. Contrast this to the former slaves, who had no citizenship in any African country, and neither did their parents. The situations of the former slaves and that of illegal alien children are, thus, starkly different. The very man who wrote the words, Senator Jacob Howard of Michigan, stated the Citizenship Clause excluded &ldquo;persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rewarding illegal aliens by granting citizenship to their children is obviously politically correct loathing for our country by the treasonous rulers who misrule over us. Correcting this backwards interpretation of the Constitution shouldn&rsquo;t take another constitutional amendment. Of course, if it is easier to just change the Constitution, we should do that. <br>

		<p>16 Recovering:</p>
<p>The 14th never had as its original intent birthright citizenship for anchor babies, nor as a mechanism to dismantle segregation.  It was meant to make freed black slaves as citizens.  The very same Congress that approved the 14th turned right around (within a weeks time) and segregated D.C.&rsquo;s public schools.</p>
<p>You and I might think of the 14th that way, but the Constitution means what nine people in black robes say it means.  Rule of law?  Baloney.</p>

		<p>Even if this initiative is passed  &mdash;  which is itself unlikely, it has scant chance of surviving judical scrutiny.  While it is true, the 14th amendment was never intended to create a birth-right for anchor babies, the modern intepretation is contra, and that is unlikely to change quickly enough for the Constitution to be of any assistance.  </p>
<p>This initiative may succeed in drawing attention to the urgent problem of anchor babies, but it will not succeed in changing the law.  As it stands, by Supreme Court decree, even the foreign-born children of illegal immigrants must be provided with a free, public education by virtue of their presence within a state&rsquo;s borders.  And as the number of sympathetic hispanics in the U.S. increases, the more reluctant the courts will be to provoke unrest with perceived &#8216;ant-hispanic&rsquo; rulings.  As long as illegal immigrants are present within our country, they will syphon off resources in one form or another until they are removed.  There is no legislative solution to the problem which allows illegal immigrants to remain present in our country.  Removal is the only option.</p>

<p>The 14th amendment does not say so.  The anti White racist Judges say so.  Unfortunately we do not have a balance of 3 powers.  We have Judicial supremacy.  The Judges are intent on destroying Whites.</p>

		<p>If you take the 14th amendment literally, that a US born child is a US citizen, regardless of the intent of the writers, then this does not mean the parents become citizens or have a right to be here.</p>
<p>So the choice is one of do we take the child back home with us or not?</p>

		<p>We do have the right to deny citizenship to the children of illegal aliens because they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States government. In fact, it was not until 1924 that all American Indians were granted American citizenship, even though they were all born on US soil and had ancestors who were here long before this nation even existed.  (BTW, the 14th amendment was incorporated into the constitution back in the 1860s) But even if this initiative wins at the ballot box, expect some left-wing judge to overrule the will of the people, just like in 1994 with proposition 187 (which would have denied aliens certain gov&rsquo;t benefits). If we really want to send a wake-up call to our rulers on this issue, a multitude of states should have similar measures on the ballot next year. If the matter of gay marriage was suddenly put on the ballot in 13 states in 2004, why can the same be done with illegal immigration? Why aren&rsquo;t activists pushing for similar referendums in other states, not just California? </p>
