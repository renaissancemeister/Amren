<p>The Age of Obama has brought many things to the American scene  &mdash;  none more important than the proof that skin color is no barrier to success. But for some white Americans, it has also helped crystallize a sense of dislocation, anger and powerlessness.</p>
<p>Some, like Wilkerson&rsquo;s group, have even adopted the language and techniques used by blacks, women, Latinos and gays in their civil rights struggles. But some analysts ask: Is this white victimhood? Strident TV host Glenn Beck of Fox News Channel tapped into the feeling this summer when he accused Obama of having &#8220;a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some, it was reinforced by the sight of a New Haven, Conn., firefighter telling senators that the Latina judge Obama had nominated to the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, had discriminated against him in an appellate case because he is white. Or Obama condemning the arrest of a black Harvard professor by a white police officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;White America needs to be heard from, not just lectured to,&#8221; wrote commentator Patrick J. Buchanan in response to Obama&rsquo;s speech on race during the 2008 campaign. &#8220;This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard.&#8221; Among the grievances: affirmative action provisions that &#8220;advance black applicants over white applicants.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ron Walters, an emeritus professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland who was a campaign manager for the Rev. Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s 1980s presidential bids, has written that today&rsquo;s anti-tax &#8220;tea party&#8221; protests and heated town hall rhetoric are reminiscent of the conservative resurgence of the 1970s. That movement was driven in part by racial hostility and the ability of its leaders to convince white followers that they were victims. (The years after the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act saw court-ordered integration of schools and the adoption of affirmative action programs.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fact that Obama is not just liberal, but black, said Walters, adds to the resentment.</p>
<p>But Dallas Woodhouse, the North Carolina director of the conservative Americans for Prosperity, said that people like Walters &#8220;are reading the memo that came out of Washington to pull the race card out.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not about race,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s about socialism&hellip; . I think it&rsquo;s actually the policies that are scaring people.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Drew Westen, a psychologist at Emory University who has worked for Democrats, said feelings of victimhood were stoked by Republicans during Senate hearings for Sotomayor. &#8220;They attacked her as a racist, and where they scored points is with a lot of Americans  &mdash;  not only with conservatives, but a lot of Democratic white males  &mdash;  who have been on the losing end of affirmative action,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In Westen&rsquo;s view, Republicans were able &#8220;to make the case that whites are getting a bad deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Wednesday, former President Carter entered the fray. The lifelong Georgia resident told NBC&rsquo;s Brian Williams that &#8220;an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jared Taylor, a controversial writer who calls himself a &#8220;race realist&#8221; but has been described by one civil rights activist as &#8220;the cultivated, cosmopolitan face of white supremacy,&#8221; said the enormous demographic changes of the last few decades fuel the idea that whites are losing ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the extent that white people in some inchoate way see Obama as a symbol of their dispossession, it&rsquo;s only that they have not been seeing what has been going on for years,&#8221; said Taylor.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau estimates that whites will become a minority in 2042. Citing that fact, Taylor added, &#8220;No other people in the history of the world has given up numerical and cultural dominance willingly. The majority of whites did not vote for Barack Obama.&#8221; (Obama received 43% of the white vote.)</p>
<p>For all the sense of disempowerment, whites still surpass other groups by many measures. Eighty percent of the Senate is white male. Seventy-four percent of white, non-Latino households own their homes, compared with 48% for blacks and Latinos.</p>
<p>Mark Potok, who directs the Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s Intelligence Project  &mdash;  and the activist who called Taylor a white supremacist  &mdash;  agreed with Taylor that changing demographics are stoking fear. &#8220;Obama&rsquo;s election simply makes visceral what was already occurring, which is a very major changeover from a society that really has been dominated by white people to a society that is generally multiracial,&#8221; Potok said.</p>
<p>American political discourse has always contained an angry fringe, and the emotional rallies and occasionally ugly rhetoric of Obama&rsquo;s opponents are neither new nor especially extreme, according to political scientists. Courting white voters&rsquo; sense of victimhood is nothing new, either.</p>
<p>President Nixon appealed to Southern whites by exploiting concerns about civil rights reforms and the cultural upheaval of the times. And in 1988, George H.W. Bush used a TV political ad that featured a menacing mug shot of Willie Horton, a black convicted murderer, in his successful drive to beat Michael S. Dukakis for the presidency.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Toby Harnden, Telegraph (London), Sept. 16, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The election of Barack Obama was supposed to be the bright new dawn of a post-racial America. His swearing in on the steps of Washington&rsquo;s Capitol building seemed to represent a historical watershed, a full stop at the end of a chapter in United States history that included segregation and slavery.</p>
<p>So what has gone wrong with America since that frigid January day? Turn on the news now and we are assailed with reports of disgracefully racist placards being carried at anti-Obama rallies nominally billed as opposition to health-care reform. </p>
<p>A virulent campaign by the so-called &#8220;Birthers&#8221; is being waged, in which it is alleged that Mr Obama was really born in Kenya rather than Hawaii and is therefore not qualified to be commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>A white Congressman from the Deep South shouts, &#8220;You lie!&#8221; at the first black president and refuses to apologise to fellow members of the House of Representatives. Democrats and their media allies mutter darkly that Congressman Joe Wilson really meant &#8220;You boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not a fringe accusation. Even former President Jimmy Carter, himself a son of the segregated South, stated baldly that Mr Wilson&rsquo;s intemperate outburst was &#8220;based on racism&#8221; and ran &#8220;deeper&#8221; than mere policy opposition. &#8220;There is an inherent feeling among many in this country that an African-American should not be president,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But wait a minute. Mr Obama convincingly prevailed over John McCain in last November&rsquo;s election, an event that many American liberals argued could never happen in &#8220;racist&#8221; America. He has, moreover, not been shot by a redneck, giving the lie to an almost routine pre-election assertion in Europe that a black man could never be elected President, and if he was, he would be assassinated.</p>
<p>The election was a little over 10 months ago. Has America really turned around and stumbled back into the sulphurous swamps of racial hatred?</p>
<p>The short answer is no. Mr Obama is becoming a much less popular figure than he was when he entered office, partly because of the usual laws of political gravity, but also because of the unrealistic expectations he encouraged and the number of mistakes he has made.</p>
<p>To dismiss race as a factor in either last November&rsquo;s election or current political debate would be foolish. It was, of course, ludicrous to expect that the US would become a post-racial country overnight. History  &mdash;  and racial tension  &mdash;  did not stop with the election of Mr Obama. </p>
<p>In the 2008 vote, 96 per cent of blacks voted for the then Illinois senator. Since then, the demographic that is most disappointed by him is whites. According to a recent Pew Research poll, white support for Mr Obama has plunged by 11 points since April.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is Mr Obama&rsquo;s own extraordinary life story and the part it played in his election. As the son of a black Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas who was an infant at the height of the civil rights era, Mr Obama was a candidate who stood outside the mainstream African-American experience.</p>
<p>He had grown up in multi-racial Hawaii and been raised by a white mother and white grandparents. His Harvard Law School pedigree, ease in any kind of racial setting and palpable comfort in his own skin gave him extraordinary appeal among whites. He made white Americans feel better about themselves. </p>
<p>Mr Obama was as different as it was possible to be from the likes of the Rev Jesse Jackson and the Rev Al Sharpton, black politicians who had built their careers on exploiting racial grievances. He was not the Rev Reginald Bacon, the Harlem racial agitator in Tom Wolfe&rsquo;s The Bonfire of the Vanities, the 1987 blockbuster novel that centred on racial tensions in the Big Apple; instead, he was Bishop Warren Bottomley.</p>
<p>The churchman, Wolfe wrote, was &#8220;one of those well-educated, urbane black people who immediately create the Halo Effect in the eyes of white people&hellip;He was handsome, slender, about forty-five, athletic in build. He had a ready smile, a glittering eye, a firm handshake&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a remarkably prescient description of Mr Obama. As now Vice President Joe Biden put it in a characteristic stream of consciousness that condemned him to the ranks of also-ran presidential candidates: &#8220;I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that&rsquo;s a storybook, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Layered on to this were Mr Obama&rsquo;s own assiduous efforts to make himself acceptable in the eyes of black voters. A key element of this was rooting himself in his wife Michelle&rsquo;s home city of Chicago, where he joined the Trinity United Church of Christ. The pastor there was the Rev Jeremiah Wright, a character who, with his ranting sermons about the &#8220;US of KKK&#8221; and &#8220;God Damn America&#8221;, even Tom Wolfe might have blushed at creating.</p>
<p>Once he had established his African-American credentials, Mr Obama&rsquo;s church attendance dropped off. After staging a very public show of looking for a church in Washington this year, Mr Obama quietly elected to make his place of worship the chapel at the presidential retreat at Camp David. His Christianity  &mdash;  much vaunted during the campaign, not least to inoculate him against his Muslim background  &mdash;  seems to be of the Easter-and-Christmas variety.</p>
<p>Mr Obama&rsquo;s rhetorical brilliance saved his campaign from imploding when the furore over his association with Wright broke, just as he was overcoming Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries. One of the impressions that was left, however, was that he was prepared to use the issue of race when it suited him. Strategically, he knew that to be painted as &#8220;the black candidate&#8221; would be a political death sentence, but tactically he was prepared to work the racial angles.</p>
<p>Similarly, Mr Obama has been anxious to avoid being boxed into the category of &#8220;first black president&#8221;. But he foolishly waded into a controversy over the arrest of a black Harvard professor by a white policeman, trying to score an easy political point by criticising the seemingly blameless officer. </p>
<p>More seriously, Mr Obama is the leader of a Democratic party that is now coming dangerously close to proclaiming that any fervent opposition to him must spring from a racist impulse.</p>
<p>In targeting Mr Wilson, they appear to have the wrong man. A previously anonymous congressman, all of whose four sons have served in the US military  &mdash;  two in Iraq  &mdash;  he comes across more as an ordinary American who let his mouth run away with him than as a venomous racist.</p>
<p>His shout, moreover, reflected a manifestation of genuine anger felt by many ordinary Americans about the wholesale state intervention of the Obama administration that amounts to an ambitious and radical transformation of the country. Crying racism can be a cheap way of shutting down debate.</p>
<p>By attempting to marginalise Mr Wilson as a racist, Democrats are playing a dangerous game because, as Armstrong Williams, a black conservative, lamented in his Washington Times column yesterday, &#8220;preventing people from discussing diverse ideas only stimulates hatred&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some of the opposition to Mr Obama is unquestionably racially motivated. Rusty LePass, a South Carolina Republican, was rightly vilified after commenting on his Facebook page about a report of a gorilla escape from a zoo: &#8220;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just one of Michelle&rsquo;s ancestors  &mdash;  probably harmless.&#8221; And a number of the signs at Saturday&rsquo;s Obama rally were, to put it mildly, unfortunate. One depicted a lion with the words: &#8220;The Zoo has an African [lion] and the White House has a Lyin&rsquo; African.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Obama&rsquo;s election was a moment of triumph for the US and a major step towards erasing the awful stain of slavery. The president himself has a nuanced, sophisticated approach to racial matters.</p>
<p>He is in danger, however, of allowing race to be the principal political weapon used by Democrats against Republicans. A failure to show presidential leadership by calling a halt to this folly could fuel opposition to the Obama agenda  &mdash;  and unpick the scab of racism just as the old wounds were beginning to heal. <br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s be very clear about something. Barack Obama worshipers such as Chris &#8220;Barack sends a thrill up my leg&#8221; Matthews are equating racism with racial preference. Moreover, this is combined with the view that Native Born White Americans are not allowed to have a racial prefence for the future racial composition of America&hellip;only blacks,asians,muslims and hispanics are allowed to have a racial preference..that is to say non-whites are allowed to be racist.</p>
<p>If Native Born White Americans concede this framework to Barack Obama worshippers they will be in constant retreat and bludgeoned into racial oblivion within the borders of America.</p>
<p>Barack Obama worshippers demand that Native Born White Americans commit racial suicide within the borders of America. Native Born White Americans are under no obligation to do this.</p>
<p>White Nationlists must make the massive race-replacement of Native Born Americans the focus of every public debate with Immigration Enthusiasts. There really is nothing else to debate. Native Born White American interests must completely frame the terms of every debate..to the exclusion of post-1965 non-white interests.The fact of the matter is, there really is no debate. WE oppose the race replacement of Native Born White Amerians within the borders of America. WE are complete rejectionist on this matter. There will be no compromise. </p>

		<p> To most liberals, &#8220;White victimhood&#8221; is an oxymoron. In their racial worldview, you cannot be White in America, and a victim, too. Because, you see, we have all the power, all the wealth, all the advantages &hellip;</p>
<p> Except we don&rsquo;t, of course   &mdash;   that is, if we ever did. And IF we did at one time, why shouldn&rsquo;t we have? We built this country. If we now feel marginalized, victimized, discriminated against, by what right do they treat that fact dismissively, as if we had no right to feel that way? When someone feels that he&rsquo;s being disenfranchised and robbed, is he supposed to just shrug his shoulders and say, &#8220;Oh, well, I guess we had it coming &hellip; slavery and all that, you know &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p> At least White Americans are finally waking up, and standing up. No, we&rsquo;re NOT going to take it any more! The Tea Parties and the 9/12 rallies are the surest sign of that.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The Age of Obama has brought many things to the American scene &mdash; none more important than the proof that skin color is no barrier to success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skin color has never been a barrier to success in the last 40 years at least.  Inability, lack of intelligence, a reluctance to apply oneself, lack of creativity and a complete lack of mental discipline, are what has always been the reasons as to why blacks can&rsquo;t qualify for higher positions.  And, to try to twist things around, pretending the only thing that differentiates blacks from the other races is skin color is the claims of an absolute fool.</p>
<p>And, even the leftist claim of skin color, being the only difference between blacks and whites, is bogus, because blacks generally have broad flat noses, kinky hair, and thick lips, while whites have none of these traits, so it would be in everybody best interests if the leftist radicals would quit pretending that only skin color is different.  Preposterous.</p>
<p>And so far as Obama being proof positive that black men can make it to higher positions is an assertion just as bogus as the skin color claim, because he&rsquo;s not a &#8220;black man&#8221; he&rsquo;s half white, and he is by FAR the rarity and the exception to the rule.  Obama is an anomaly in the black world. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just false claims like those made in this report that are the basis for white hatred, because they tell these mentally challenged blacks that are below the white norm (Which is the vast, vast majority of them)they are not able to make it because of white oppression and racism.</p>
<p>Blacks and the liberal fringe have two lies they constantly harp on to offset black incompetence:  1) Blacks and whites are equal in all things.  2) The only difference between blacks and whites is skin color.  It is the repetition of these two Orwellian lies that blacks and white radicals hope to force blacks into all aspects of professional societies in this nation, intimidating everyone to the point where they dare not speak truthfully for fear of being destroyed.</p>
<p>Has anybody noticed that they&rsquo;re screaming &#8220;racist&#8221; now to anybody that dares to oppose their cap and trade legislation and, especially, the health care debacle?</p>
<p>Blacks generally aren&rsquo;t intelligent enough to wage the sort of psychological warfare and propaganda scheme that has been carried out for quite a long time now, but their allies within the mentally aberrant white fringe are, and that&rsquo;s exactly what is happening, and most of the right are terrified to mention black incompetence, so they can&rsquo;t fight back effectively.</p>

		<p>I seem to recall that not so long ago there was intense hatred directed against George W. Bush.  Most of this came from the left, but there were more than a few highly disgruntled paleoconservatives as well.  There were no hand wringing articles in the papers about how this was really just disguised racism.  Instead our media masters regarded this as a normal and expected state of affairs.</p>
<p>But now that we have a mulatto President with left wing politics approved by the New York Times any criticism is deemed to  be driven by racism.  To be sure, some of the accusations have been over the top.  Obama isn&rsquo;t Hitler.  But he is a Big State socialist.  He is lying when he says that socialized health care won&rsquo;t be given to illegals.  When Republicans tried to get an amendment added to the health care bill that would require beneficiaries to show proof of legal residency all the Democrats voted against it, so the amendment failed.  In any case we all know that in 2010 Obama plans to make a big push for giving citizenship to the 15 million or more illegal immigrants in this country, so one way or another the Democrats will ensure that the illegals get to pick our pockets.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s deficits have achieved what I had though would be impossible - they make the Bush deficits seem fiscally responsible.  Moving from half trillion dollar a year deficits to deficits of over one trillion dollars a year seems to me a good enough reason in itself to want to kick out the Democrats, including top dog Obama.</p>
<p>Obama himself has stated that he believes in a &#8220;living&#8221; Constitution, which means that he doesn&rsquo;t believe in upholding the Constitution at all.  A &#8220;living&#8221; Constitution means you have liberal judges decide what they want the laws to be and then pretend that the Constitution mandates them, making reference to such things as the ever mysterious penumbras and emanations of the Constitution.  Obama&rsquo;s choice of Sotomayer for the Supreme Court shows that our worst fears are justified.</p>
<p>Only on foreign policy would I rate Obama as (marginally) better than Bush.  But Bush didn&rsquo;t set the bar very high.  We&rsquo;re still mired in Iraq.  Ron Paul would have got us out by now.</p>
<p>I believe that all the criticisms I&rsquo;ve made are rational and well founded, but Obama is a mulatto, so I must really be driven by racism!<br>

		<p>Does White American hate Barack Obama? Not so much as he hates us, and with far less cause. Whites raised and nurtured him, and he repayed us with spite. Still, seeing Jared Taylor cited in the L.A. Times for expert opinion on a topic where he is clearly a leading expert, does show a growing fear of reality that has been missing in the MSM. Now that the silent majority is silent no more, but rather has gotten in the multi-cultist&rsquo;s face, they have noticed us and even shown some respect to our perspective. I hope the lesson sinks in to whites on the sidelines. If you want to win the game, you must first take the field.</p>

<p>This statement alone shows the type of mentality that is really the one out of whack.  This is a society that was created by whites for whites so why wouldn&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t we be the dominant force?  We fought the Indians and won.  We are being dispossessed by people who despise us and are not appreciative of the sacrifices we make on their behalf.  It&rsquo;s never acknowledged and never, ever enough&hellip;.. the demands are endless.</p>
<p>I, personally, think the tables are starting to turn; and, it&rsquo;s about time.  This was forced upon the majority of us and we are sick of it!!!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just that we&rsquo;re losing ground, it&rsquo;s who we&rsquo;re losing ground to.  A bunch of squabbling, unappreciative minorities and Third Worlders who don&rsquo;t want to be a part of the nation we created but who want to replace the nation and remove its founding stock.  Now, what clear-headed, non-guilt ridden white would celebrate such a plan and accommodate such an act?<br>

		<p>I cannot for the life of me get into this worship of the great black messiah.  When did the USA develop such a propensity for utter foolishness?  Don&rsquo;t answer that&hellip;I&rsquo;m old enough to remember better days (i.e., before 1965).   Not only are we being assailed by blacks and lefties here in our own country, but we have to listen to (or read) tripe by journalists (and I use the term loosely) from the UK such as Toby Harnden of the London Telegraph.  In a few of his paragraphs near the end of his rambling piece, he actually starts to, or borders on, making some sense, but by that time you&rsquo;ve had to wade through a ton of garbage.  Mr. Harnden starts out with:</p>
<p> &#8220;The election of Barack Obama was supposed to be the bright new dawn of a post-racial America. His swearing in on the steps of Washington&rsquo;s Capitol building seemed to represent a historical watershed, a full stop at the end of a chapter in United States history that included segregation and slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can anyone discuss anything these days without bringing up the legacy of slavery and segregation?  It&rsquo;s bad enough when it comes from here in America, but where do the English have any room to kick us around about slavery?  From what I&rsquo;ve seen of the downfall of England (note that I&rsquo;m not picking on Scotland, Wales, and Ireland YET), they could use a little more race realism, actually a lot more White racism, before England ceases to be.  Slightly off-topic, I&rsquo;ve heard some of the English condemn the US for &#8220;colonialism&#8221;.  Whose empire was it upon with the sun never set? <br>

		<p>White America must not fall, if you fall there will be only Russia.</p>
<p>I hope that Obama will be the awakening of whites all over the world and especially Europe.</p>
<p>It is obvious what Obama wants, grant citizenship to mexicans and then assume absolute power.</p>

		<p>Does white America hate Obama? Not as much as he and his Marxist handlers hate whites, traditional America and the West. But don&rsquo;t worry, the farther they go in trying to achieve their goals of wiping out whites and what&rsquo;s left of America, the higher the level of anger in whites will become. And eventually that will turn into hate. A hatred toward the left and all associated with it. It won&rsquo;t be pretty in the end, but it will be well deserved. </p>

		<p>Yesterday, Speaker Nancy &#8220;the Octopol&#8221; Pelosi expressed concern that discourse by the right might lead to violence.  What are the demographics of death in San Francisco?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about race,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about socialism&hellip; . I think it&rsquo;s actually the policies that are scaring people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As long as white America is too afraid to make it about race then we will be unable to have a frank discussion among ourselves so to speak to figure out what sort of solutions would be appropriate to our continued displacement and artificial socio-economic disempowerment.</p>

		<p>Maybe &#8220;conservatives&#8221; is a term that is being as grossly misused as &#8220;racist.&#8221; Or had this not occurred to anyone yet. The values we &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are guilty of&hellip; wanting a clean, decent wholesome America to raise our families, to live and work in. With plentiful jobs for everyone willing to work.</p>
<p>We are against illegal immigration&hellip; for the staggering dollar cost to our taxpayers who have to support the illegal parasites&hellip; for the crime and social problems that is an inevitable byproduct of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also tired of seeing our nation become &#8220;owned&#8221; by foreign banking conglomerates, thanks to the deficit spending Congress can&rsquo;t seem to avoid. The entanglement, deeper and deeper, into a war in Afghanistan we cannot win. The equally stupid war on drugs also draining our coffers. If we truly WANTED to win the war on drugs, we&rsquo;d just have to send our Marines and Army south; take over the government and then meet out swift and deadly justice to anyone caught with illegal drugs or carrying weapons.</p>
<p>So our &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are supposed to be evil, mean-spirited people because we&rsquo;re also damned tired of carrying the our third-world populations on our financial backs&hellip; while so many of our own people are living in or at near-poverty levels? Maybe the detractors need to take a good hard look at the term &#8220;conservatives.&#8221; Maybe AMERICANS would be a better term to describe us.</p>

<p>I know why they don&rsquo;t.  They&rsquo;ve stupidly placed non-Whites in positions of power and they have to tiptoe around the issue lest someone like Clarence Thomas might turn against them.<br>
