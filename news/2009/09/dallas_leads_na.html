			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert T. Garrett, Dallas Morning News, September 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dallas leads the nation in the percentage of teen births that aren&rsquo;t the mother&rsquo;s first delivery, a nonpartisan national research group finds in a new report.</p>
<p>Dallas had the highest percentage of teen births that are repeat births  &mdash;  28 percent  &mdash;  among 73 major U.S. cities in 2006, the latest year for which city-level data are available.</p>
<p>Texas has the highest repeat rate of any state  &mdash;  23 percent of teen births. And five of the 15 worst-ranked cities are in Texas, according to the group Child Trends, in a report to be released Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Child Trends, a nonpartisan Washington-based group that tries to improve child well-being by providing research to policymakers, teases out repeat teen births from vital statistics gathered by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Texas had the highest repeat rate of any state for the sixth consecutive year. Among seven metro areas, Arlington had the lowest rate, 19 percent, while Fort Worth&rsquo;s 25-percent rate was in a tie nationally for seventh-highest. Also making the list were San Antonio with 26 percent, and Houston and Austin, both with repeat teen birth rates of 24 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the city&rsquo;s 3,739 teen births in 2006, the report says, 64 percent were to Hispanics, 30 percent to blacks and 6 percent to whites. Although most were to 18- or 19-year-olds, there were 72 to girls 14 or younger.</p>
<p>The 28 percent repeat birth rate means nearly 1,050 of the babies born to local girls that year weren&rsquo;t the girls&rsquo; first.</p>
<p><b>Abstinence-only issue</b></p>
<p>Cathie Adams, president of Texas Eagle Forum, a social conservative group, said the statistics reflect how Dallas is a magnet for immigrants.</p>
<p>Adams said an abstinence message needs to be pushed in the public schools in a variety of languages.</p>

		<p>The news story is legit, but I have always been bothered by calling 18- and 19-year old women who give birth as &#8220;teenage mothers.&#8221;  They are, after all, legal adults, who can sign contracts for the necessities of their and their children&rsquo;s lives.  And they are close to a very healthy age for childbirth   &mdash;   IIRC, the regular poster &#8220;White Nurse&#8221; noted here that 22 is the healthiest age for a woman to give birth, with 18 and 19 years old women in what she said is a healthy range.</p>
<p>Now, if those 18- and 19-year old women giving birth were black and of the other gender, and gang bangers getting smoked, they would be considered &#8220;children&#8221; in the jargon of President Clinton stating that &#8220;20 children a day die from gunfire.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Only 6 percent of teen-age births are to whites&#8221;.</p>
<p>lol Sounds like we are falling behind.</p>
<p>Unrelated to this&hellip; Was on a site were you could take a test to see if you have an &#8216;authoritarian personality&rsquo;. I remember the study about the authoritarian personality from High School or college. The questions on the &#8216;test&rsquo; were basically designed to see whether you were liberal or conservative. If you are conservative you have an &#8216;authoritarian personality&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Looked at from a larger perspective it was basically more of the &#8216;everything that is good in this world is really bad, and everything bad, good. </p>

		<p>I was technically a &#8220;teenage mother&#8221; since my first child was born one month before my 20th birthday. On the other hand, I had already been married a little over 2 years, my husband and I were high school graduates, both college students and both gainfully employeed at the time. We were living on our own, supporting ourselves, (with NO public assistance of any kind), Oh wait, maybe that&rsquo;s because we are both white and that&rsquo;s what we were raised to do.</p>

		<p>An 18 or 19 year old woman who gives birth to a legitimate child, in my view, is a significantly different creature from a teen-mom who just drops a child without benefit of mariage.</p>

		<p>Does it really surprise anyone that hispanics are leading the way in this? This is afterall encouraged by the activists who see this as a way to overwhelm America and takeover through shear numbers and make whitey pay for their own displacement as a majority.</p>

<p>Talk about missing the point.  What I find funny is that so many pseudo-cons like Cathie Adams are probably surprised that the Republicans and &#8220;conservatives&#8221; lost the 2008 elections.</p>

<p>The world has become a horror show in which I can&rsquo;t even see a pregnant White woman and not wonder if the baby she&rsquo;s carrying is of her own people.  Being denied exclusive territory is a death sentence for people of European heritage.  Social conventions (that hardly exist anymore)against miscegenation are not enough.  Teach your children well if you want a future in which Whites exist as something more than slaves.</p>

		<p>What is being born in Dallas and other areas of America is  a massive and powerfull voting block of hispanics,asians,muslims and africans that will very soon be in a position to vote for the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Native born White Americans-the majority racial group in America-is being forced to subsidize the birth of this voting block.</p>
<p>What happens to Native Born White Americans when non-whites are a majority in the military and police forces aroud the country?</p>
<p>Numbersusa.com makes the case for immigration reform based exclusively on how immigration &#8220;harms&#8221; post-1965 non-whites..the group that in the near future will be in position to vote for the reace-replacement of Native Born White Americans. I think it is  about time that Peter Brimelow and vdare.com goes after the poltical liberals ove at numbersusa.</p>

		<p>Abstinence?!  Oh boy, the Texas Eagle Forum is on the right train, but headed the wrong direction.  Teaching abstinence is what brought Texas into the high numbers of illegitimate teenage births we now experience.  It&rsquo;d be more effective to teach kids what they can do to prevent pregnancy, abstinence of course being the best, but in reality, least utilized method.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing we never hear about the 17,18 and 19 year old Mothers.  About 70 percent of them are either married or get married shortly after the birth of the baby. And about 85 percent of the teenage Mothers are  17 and older by the time the babies are born.</p>
<p>But the liberals who earn a living from society&rsquo;s disfunctional members have created the myth that teen age Mothers are starving ghetto 14 year olds impregnated by no one knows who.</p>

<p>Phyllis Schlafly, Eagle Forum&rsquo;s founder, and I are natives of the same city, and she really does a stand up job on a lot of issues.  But on this, EF is barking up the wrong tree, or at least they&rsquo;re trying to joust a windmill.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that sex is fun, and many Chicano Hispanics (and blacks) have almost no inhibitions or self-restraint, pre-martial teenage sex for certain Hispanics in America is also a career path.  For anyone to ask them to abstain is also asking them not to have fun or get gringo money.</p>

		<p>A statistic I would like to have included, how many of those are illegal aliens? I bet at least 50% of these &#8220;innocent teens&#8221; are illegals trying to ensure they are never deported by cranking out an anchor baby ASAP. And I would wager even more that 90% of those non-white mothers are either anchor babies themselves or having anchor babies. There was a story out of Dallas not long ago reporting that the vast majority of new borns are from illega laliens, paid for by taxpayers. </p>
<p>Eliminating birthright citizenship is by far the best and easiest way to stem the racial displacement of white Americans. Next would be immigration reductions. So encourage your representatives to support bills that will end birthright citizenship. One is introduced every year but dies in committee. If it is not ended, our future is bleak because there is no appetite in DC for immigraiotn reductions right now. But birthright citizenship has been ended even in socialist Europe. Gives PC politicians cover. We just have to demand it.</p>

		<p>Here in NN, VA, the percentage of unmarried black births was 72%&hellip;just read the story two days ago.  Guess who will be subsidizing those births?  Hint: It will not be the ones responsible for the births.</p>

		<p>Frank Salter, in his seminal book &#8220;On Genetic Interests&#8221;, outlined the optimal strategy for the fastest population growth. Affirmation of early pregnancy, and out of wedlock children being reared by uncles and aunts, were among the main elements of that strategy.</p>
<p>Guess what, the Mexicans (call them Latinos or Hispanics I you want) are doing just that. It&rsquo;s a full-throttle demographic war against us, paleo-Americans.<br>
