			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adversity.net, July 23, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to OPM&rsquo;s FY 2006 report, all 23 independent federal agencies exceeded their racial quotas for hiring blacks by dozens or even hundreds of percent.</p>
<p>This year the First Place prize in the federal quota competition again goes to Court Services and Offender Services (CSOS) for employing 808% more blacks than their affirmative action target (quota).</p>
<p>And NASA again came in dead last by exceeding its black hiring quota by a mere 49%</p>
<p>Each of the other 23 independent federal agencies exceeded their racial quotas for hiring blacks in FY 2006 by 62% to 503%.</p>
<p>The five best independent agencies for overhing blacks in FY 2006 were CSOS (808%), U.S. GPO (503%), the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) at 409%, the EEOC (401%), and the Smithsonian Institution (338%).</p>
<p>The five &#8220;worst&#8221; agencies for blacks still over shot their racial quotas by significant amounts:  NASA (49%), the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) at 62%, NRC (68%), FDIC (97%), and the Securities and Exchange Commission at 113%.   These percentages represent the amount by which the agency overhired blacks as compared to the availability of this group in the civilian work force.</p>
<p><big><b>1.2  &mdash;  Federal Executive Departments:</b></big></p>
<p>OPM&rsquo;s FY 2006 report reveals that among the 18 federal executive departments, once again this year only the Department of the Interior failed to achieve its racial hiring goal (quota) for hiring blacks.  Interior &#8220;under&#8221; hired blacks by -37%, i.e., they don&rsquo;t &#8220;look like America&#8221; because they hired 37% fewer blacks than are available in the civilian labor force.</p>
<p>All of the other 17 federal executive departments exceeded their racial quotas for hiring blacks by a minimum of +14% (Air Force) to an impressive +363% (Housing and Urban Development).</p>
<p>The five &#8220;best&#8221; federal executive departments for overhing blacks were HUD (363%), the Dept. of Education (329%), the Dept. of State (231%), the Labor Dept. (176%), and the Veteran&rsquo;s Administration (147%).</p>
<p>Most of the bottom five &#8220;worst&#8221; independent agencies for overhiring blacks in FY 2006 still managed to exceed their quota by significant percentages.  The exception is the Dept. of the Interior which once again missed their quota by -37%.  However, the next &#8220;worst&#8221; agency for blacks, the Air Force, exceeded their quota for blacks by 14%, the Dept. of Agriculture by 15%, the Navy by 19%, and the U.S. Dept. of Transportation by 22%.</p>

		<p>Nasa came in last. So, eventually we will have to lower the standards, like they did in are military. Whenever I see surface pictures of Mars, or venus, or the ISS, I always say to myself &#8220;that&rsquo;s the accomplishments of whites only.&#8221; Sure, asians would of eventually went through the industrial revolution and made it to space but Africans would of remained in Africa. Quotas are very dangerous because they put groups of people in situations that their people never had the intellect to create themselves. Very dangerous. </p>

		<p>That is why blacks always vote for Democrats, who always promise to expand the size of government.  Because government has a monopoly over whatever it does it does not have to be efficient, so persists for years with large numbers of half competent and outright incompetent employees.  In short, a perfect employment scenario for  black people.  Best yet, those government jobs are the only jobs left (aside from the very rare CEO positions) that still offer defined benefit pensions.  So long after the blacks retire they&rsquo;ll have a legally guaranteed right to mooch off the rest of us.<br/>

		<p>This is bizarre wording to point out that whites are underrepresented at 17 out of 18 federal departments. There&rsquo;s even more to &#8216;celebrate&rsquo; as the white population has an average age close to 40, while the black population averages closer to 20 years of age. </p>

I would so like to see that too.</p>
<p>I managed to do a little snoopying after being turned down for some government jobs and in the few cases I was able to verify I was passed over for a woman or a minority. In each case the position called for a degree but they ignored mine and gave other experience as a degree equivalent so I can;t see where they could really say I wasn&rsquo;t more qualified.</p>

		<p>I work for local government in a small, highly White community. I&rsquo;ve followed Ron Paul during the caucuses, donated heavily to his campaign, and agree with much of what he says regarding decreasing the size of government.</p>
<p>I think minority hiring policies are a major reason for dissatisfaction with government. In the county I work for I&rsquo;ve witnessed both the incompetence of minority Hispanics and Blacks, and the aggressive racial-nepotism of East Asian and South Asian management. The public experiences the former, as Blacks and Hispanics typically get front-desk jobs interacting with the public, whereas most of the employees experience the latter, which lowers morale internally.</p>
<p>My community is ~90% White. Minorities make up ~30% of our county&rsquo;s workforce. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine a government functioning with more employed minorities, as is certainly the case in the hundreds of areas in the country with 
<p>What small-government people should focus on is reforming the federally-dictated diversity quotas enforced at their local government&rsquo;s HR department, rather than tearing down all government for the sake of an anarco-capitalist utopia.</p>
<p>There can be no government reform without a reform of who&rsquo;s working for government.</p></p>

		<p>Same story in Canada, best illustrated by my last visit to the tax office. As in real life, the majority of &#8220;clients&#8221; as the tax paying suckers are now called by the PC brigade were white. The entire office staff behind the counter was &#8220;ethnic&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Mr. Jackson is correct, plus we should factor in the negative impact on our society causd by black behavior, such as assaults, rapes, murders, theft, dumbing-down of our children&rsquo;s education to accommodate the stupidest black kid in the class, and general eroding of our quality of life through rap music, baggy pants, and direspectful uncivilized conduct. Exactly how is white America benefitting from this diversity???</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not rocket scientists.  Most black employees at NASA are in the soft, management side of things - procurement, HR, and of course, diversity and EEO.</p>

		<p>As bad as it is, I suspect they cooked the books to conceal minority over-hire. </p>
<p>The figures are derived by comparing the fraction of blacks (Latinos, women, etc.) in a given deparment vs. the fraction of blacks (Latinos, women, etc.) in the &#8220;relevant civilian labor force [RCLF]&#8221; for that department. Thus the baseline RCLF for blacks runs from 7.7% for NSF to 10.9% for the Navy. The slight variations in RCLF have huge effects on the final figure because the comparison against hiring magnifies the difference. If a department has an RCLF of 10%, and hires 15% blacks, they show up as 50% over-represented. Basically, you can cook the final figures by twiddling the numbers in the left hand column. </p>
<p>So, are they tweaking it? Hard to say for blacks, but if you head over to the women&rsquo;s page, it should be easier to see. Women are almost exactly 50% of the work force, and due to some women being out of work to raise children, one would expect the proportion to be in the wage labor force to be less than 50%. But the RCLF for women is almost always over 50%, in fact, it runs to 71.1% in the Railroad Retirement Board. Only in military organizations do you find that the RCLF for women is much lower than for men. </p>
<p>So what does it all mean? The figure in the left column (RCLF) is basically a quota target. It means this is the proportion of these people in the target population, if you are hiring less than XX% of them, you are discriminating. </p>
<p>By posting a high figure in that column, the departments are in effect told to overhire those ethnic groups; a low number means underhiring. The high figures for women basically mean that federal agencies have been forced into hiring more women by this statistical gimmick. </p>
<p>So what about the figures for blacks? They run about 10%, which is less than the proportion of blacks in the population. But I think jailbirds, druggies, and the uneducated and illiterate are weeded out of the RCLF for jobs at NASA - or should be, anyway - which means an honest RCLF for NASA or National Science Foundation would be about 1%, instead of the 9% or so that is actually there. </p>

		<p>I used to work as a civilian for a U.S. Navy captain who told an audience of his organization&rsquo;s employees, most of whom were white men who were former veterans    &mdash;   with decades of valuable experience and expertise, white men who dedicated the most productive years of their lives working to contribute to the success and excellent reputation of this same organization - this Navy Captain looked at the audience (that I was a member of) and said that when he walked the hallways of his command, that he was gravely disturbed because he saw far too many &#8216;white male&rsquo; faces   &mdash;   and that he hoped, during his time in charge of this command, that he could do everything possible to correct what he saw as a serious &#8216;problem&rsquo;.</p>
<p>808 percent over represented.   Does the light bulb flicker on yet, over the empty skulls of these white Obama voters?   We are the targets of a race war, and we are deliberately and with malice aforethought being purged from every area of employment, every area of political or government influence, and it should be obvious - even to the stupidest white imbeciles out there - that the goal is to have zero whites working for this government.  808 percent isn&rsquo;t enough, friends.  They want every last white face excluded, because these minorities and their liberal elite backers hate our race and wish to eradicate us completely in the nation of our ancestors.  </p>
<p>Oh, and has anyone given any deep thought to these efforts to award minority status to any white who can prove that they have some non-white blood in their veins?   DNA testing now can help determine this, and those who qualify can claim minority status in many areas in our collapsing society.   Is someone trying to encourage whites to breed outside of their own race, or else face a future of discrimination due to their being too white?</p>
<p>Why, this sure sounds like &#8216;genocide&rsquo; to me.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve long suspected this is one of the major reasons why government operates so inefficiently. As a young soldier stationed in the Washington area, I was astonished at the number of black clerical workers, most of whom seemed to be in some sort of running contest to see who could do the smallest amount of work.</p>
<p>Of course, part of the skewing of the numbers is due to the fact that the Washington DC area is populated overwhelmingly by blacks.</p>

		<p>Higher % of Blacks = Higher Incompetence coupled with bad attitudes.</p>
<p>Now the scary stuff:</p>
<p>Wait until we have Obamacare with its minority based addministrators.  We will be competing with blacks and other minorities that have paid absolutety nothing into the system.  It is VERY POSSIBLE that there will be a day in the near future where we find ourselves pleading to some overweight black female.  She has just said that the health services extended to you or a member of your family have exceeded there capacity and that other alternatives must now be considered.  In the back of your mind you can&rsquo;t help but think that she is totally enjoying her empowerment of your White family. <br/>
The world&rsquo;s on fire and Obamacare will be run by blacks.</p>

		<p>It is no great surprise that the minute the Civil Rights laws and affirmative action wre passed, that American worker productivity came to a screeching halt.  What used to take one white worker now takes 5 black to accomplish and not where is it more prevalent than in our court system in any major city.  In Baltimore City, where I used to work for a law firm, getting ONE file from the courthouse took 4 different clerks (all black) to accomplish.  </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just the courts, the DMV is a prime example.  Go to get your license renewed or buy your tags, you can pretty much figure being there for quite awhile especially when they take all those breaks.</p>

		<p>What you all fail to realize is that Government jobs essentially are what makes the black middle class possible.  25% of NJ state work force is black in a state that is 13% black.  And that doesn&rsquo;t count local government employees (city and county).  It is the price we pay to avoid an even higher crime rate.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think crime would be any lower if governments (of all levels) didn&rsquo;t have affirmative action employees.  I think that for the same reason that, in spite of paranoid predictions, &#8220;welfare reform&#8221; didn&rsquo;t cause riots in cities.  The reason is that black women hold the jobs and get the checks, while riots are almost entirely at the hands of black men.  </p>
<p>Although my theory might need to back to the cleaners, the 1996 &#8220;welfare reform&#8221; didn&rsquo;t reform anything, all it did was to shift the main welfare program among blacks from AFDC (now TANIF) to SSI, based on the pretense that their children were &#8220;retarded,&#8221; (even though there&rsquo;s supposed to be no such thing as IQ, right Mr. Wise, Mr. Dees, Mr. Potok, Dr. Beirich, Mr. Ignatiev?)  From the &#8216;96 &#8220;welfare reform&#8221; until 9/11, SSI was the fastest growing line item on the Federal budget.</p>

		<p>Yet another statistic that has blown a circuit in my carefully hard-wired liberal brain. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always known, of course, that blacks are being packed into government jobs, but I&rsquo;ve never believed it. </p>
<p>Now I have no excuse not to. </p>
<p>Thanks. I think. </p>

		<p>Anonymous of 11:21, It&rsquo;s not &#8216;funny&rsquo;.<br/>
The &#8216;Equal Opportunity Office&rsquo; was never, ever intended to promote &#8216;equality&rsquo; - the title was just a misnomer from the start.<br/>
The whole idea was to maginalize White men.<br/>

 What used to take one white worker now takes 5 black</p>
<p>Gayle! it still takes the 1 white worker to do the job, companies are forced to hire the 5 blacks to watch. <br/>

		<p>The Africans were one of the early races to see space-ships (working for NASA?), or so they thought as they looked at the European sailing ships arriving on their coasts some 400 years ago, or earlier still, the Arab dhows that arrived to collect another batch of slaves purchased from local chiefs who realised that as they could not beat the Arabs with a fight, they might as well profit from the transactions  The sad thought then was tha?after experinecing life with te African blacks, the Arabs concluded that they were fit for not much else but slavery but the USA has since given them their big chance.  But can they take advantage of it without demanding a free ride all the time.  Based on current progress it would appear not - still.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What small-government people should focus on is reforming the federally-dictated diversity quotas enforced at their local government&rsquo;s HR department, rather than tearing down all government for the sake of an anarco-capitalist utopia.</p>
<p>There can be no government reform without a reform of who&rsquo;s working for government.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting thought but there would also have to be some reform in civil service procedures for hiring/terminating employment.  The standards are way too low when it comes to qualifications and it is very difficult to fire someone, even for gross incompetence.  You would also be trading off black employment for an increased crime/dependency rate, so we&rsquo;re still forced to pay taxes for increased enforcement/welfare rates.  In effect, it cancels out any benefit of having a more efficient workplace or savings in government payroll.  In addition, these enflamed crime prone areas will be in close proximity to liberals.  This is why I don&rsquo;t think anyone will do anything about the overhire of blacks in the government.  </p>

		<p>If anyone really wondered why the &#8216;Government&rsquo; was completely unable to do anything even vaguely effective in response to Hurricane Katrina, here&rsquo;s the answer.  All those minority hires have completely gummed-up the mechanism of government.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure that enemy nations are thrilled to know these statistics.  They serve to verify that Uncle Sam is now completely helpless, and on very expensive life-support.</p>

		<p>Big double standard shown here. If these figures were reversed with respect to race they would be taken as blatant evidence of outrageous racial discrimination and heads would roll. </p>
<p>I can imagine how complaints by whites to the EEOC about the racial imbalance of the EEOC would be taken.</p>

		<p>I wonder how long it is going to take the federal government to make the halls of county government in the &#8220;doughnut counties&#8221; look like the city-county building in downtown Indianapolis. Think highly concentrated affirmative action in one city block and you can visualize the results. About the only whites there are those that were employed by the county when this monstrosity was built in 1962. If you look at it from the south end of the building, it is even shaped like the male member with all parts attached. </p>
<p>The doughnut counties are the seven counties that surround Marion County, Indiana. (Indianapolis and Marion County are almost one and the same.) All of these counties are 94 - 98% white. The county government building in Hendricks county (straight west of Indianapolis) has no metal detectors, there are no guards at the door and is staffed primarily by middle aged (white) women who are reasonably competent. <br/>
 <br/>
Trust me, you cannot get this type of service in downtown Indy.  At the CC building it take five minutes to run the gauntlets through the rent-a-cops, then stand in an undersized and foul smelling elevator to go wherever, then wait an eternity for service by someone who can&rsquo;t be bothered. If any Amren readers are looking to relocate to the Indianapolis area, avoid Marion County like the plague. While there are some really nice areas, most of the school districts are abysmal and like a lot of other governments, they cannot seem to live within their means.</p>
<p>It would not surprise me if the government starts trying to force everyone to live together to start with central Indiana. There are few natural barriers to building homes or businesses and the metro Indianapolis area has one of the lowest average housing costs in the nation. The surrounding counties can thank (or curse) their growth in part due to forced busing by Judge S. Hugh Dillin. The central planners would love to force commuter rail down our throats, but there is not the population density to justify it. The latest tactic used against those who still occupy space inside of Marion County is to consolidate a number of services and use the suburbs that surround the pre-1967 borders of Indianapolis to fund everything. </p>
<p>I just hope that my kids will be able to live somewhere that doesn&rsquo;t look like a scene out of The Terminator, or Detroit. I wonder what will happen to all of those minorities who were counting on fat pensions when the US economy totally collapses?</p>

		<p>I remember in college years ago the Treasury Dept had notices up on the jobs  bulletin boards stating. &#8220;If you are minority and you failed the TEA Exam (Treasury Enforcement Agent Exam) still contact us.<br/>
I passed the test and did not get hired.How many blacks did they bring in unqulified?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m astonished that no one has mentioned Mary Frances Berry who was the head of OEO (or EEOC)and famously declared that civil rights laws were passed for the benefit of blacks and white men were not entitled to their protection. </p>
<p>In administrative law proceedings in the Federal Government white men are prevented from defending themselves against racial discrimination because only &#8220;protected groups&#8221; like blacks and women are protected by the law and white men do not belong to &#8220;protected groups.&#8221; </p>
<p>When I worked at the Library of Congress decades ago some jobs stipulated that college graduates were not allowed to apply for them.  Only non-college grads would be considered.</p>

<p>&gt; I don&rsquo;t think that anyone has been claiming that diversity helps white America for some time now.  What I hear them saying it that it &#8220;helps America.&#8221;  But of course, even that claim is not true.<br/>
