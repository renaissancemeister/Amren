<h1>Tape Shows Beating on Bus of Belleville West Student</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leah Thorsen and Nicholas J.C. Pistor, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, September 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BELLEVILLE  &mdash;  A Belleville police spokesman now says an incident where a white student was beaten by teen black assailants on a bus &#8220;may not be racially motivated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was premature on my part,&#8221; said Belleville Police Capt. Don Sax. &#8220;It was my personal and emotional comment after only seeing the video briefly.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the students on the bus yesterday during the incident cheered the beating, the video shows.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The about-face came this morning as the story made national headlines. Although, Sax said it was purely his review of <a href="/">the video</a> that changed his mind.</p>
<p>Belleville has had a long history of racial turmoil, with a past that includes police harassment of black motorists, cross burnings and discrimination in city hiring.</p>
<p>The divide began a century ago, in 1903, when a black man was lynched by a mob of 5,000 people in the town square, set on fire and dismembered.</p>
<p>EARLIER STORY</p>
<p>BELLEVILLE  &mdash;  {snip}</p>
<p>The 17-year-old victim was white and the teen assailants were black. Police released a <a href="/">video of the beating</a>, which shows the victim being punched repeatedly while other students on the bus gather to watch, some cheering. It doesn&rsquo;t appear that the victim did anything to provoke an attack and tried only to defend himself. Police said it all unfolded in a five-minute span.</p>
<p>The victim was trying to find a seat and was told by two students he could not sit next to them, police said.</p>
<p>As he walked to the seat, someone shouted, &#8220;Beat his ass.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he did sit down, one teen tried to push him out of his seat then began grabbing the victim&rsquo;s neck and punching him in the face.</p>
<p>With each punch, some in the crowd chanted, &#8220;Boom, boom, boom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victim eventually returned to his seat, but another student began taunting him a few minutes later. The victim was then struck in the face.</p>
<p>It was unclear what, if anything, the bus driver did to stop the attack. At one point, before the second attack, a man shouts, &#8220;Sit down guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students intervened to help the victim both times.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two teens were taken into custody; authorities will apply for charges today. Both students have been suspended, said Superintendent Greg Moats.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but what does that have to do with a kid getting the hell beat out of him simply because he sat down by people who didn&rsquo;t want him to sit by them?  Typical of black racists and white liberals. Also making excuses for black un-civilized behavior.</p>

<p>I was a quiet kid myself back when I was a teen. Bullies won&rsquo;t leave you alone. Eventually, you&rsquo;ll get tired of it and go on the offensive. Start hitting back, and they will leave you alone.</p>
<p>I have a black belt because I swore to God and Satan both that I&rsquo;ll never be bullied like that, from any race.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, CONGRATULATIONS!!! What are you going to do with all of that money you will get from the out of court settlement?<br>
The school district will definately lose if they go to trial, so they will offer you a nice $um. <br>

<p>Wow, how do they know the police are harassing black motorists?<br>
Discrimination in city hiring?  Yeah, I can believe that.  But it is whites that are discriminated against.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The divide began a century ago, in 1903, when a black man was lynched by a mob of 5,000 people in the town square, set on fire and dismembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow, so it all goes back to 1903?  The justification for black behavior knows no bounds.  </p>
<p>I have never heard the media justify a white kid beating a black kid by pointing to something that happened in 1903?</p>
<p>And as the previous post pointed out: what was he lynched for?  </p>

		<p>This stuff happens all the time.  What I am surprised about is that it actually made the news. Not only the news, but the national news.   </p>
<p>If a tree falls in a forest and there is no one there to hear it does it make a sound?  Likewise, is it only news when the news reports it?  Is reality, what the government tells you it is?</p>

		<p>See how the media reports this.  They take an event from over 100 years ago and tie it into this unprovoked beating of a white student.  The media wants people to read about the lynching and be outraged all while suggesting the beating was a justifiable response to white aggression from generations ago.  </p>

		<p>If the races were reversed wouldn&rsquo;t police automatically assume race was a factor? Race may well have been a factor in this case. Plenty of blacks hate whites. They&rsquo;re taught to hate them by the Liberal educators in this country who believe any black trouble is automatically the fault of whites.</p>

		<p><i>What did the lynched man do?</i><p>The answer below is from https://tinyurl.com/q8ml7r<br>
<p><i>Belleville lynching</i></p>
<p><i>On June 3, 1903, David Wyatt, a black teacher and principal from Brooklyn or East St. Louis (newspaper accounts differ on his residence), was lynched on the Public Square in Belleville. It was reported in newspapers across the country.
<p><i>Wyatt is said to have <b>shot Charles Hertel, the superintendent of St. Clair County schools, in Hertel&rsquo;s office when he refused to renew Wyatt&rsquo;s teaching certification.</b> Arrested and jailed, Wyatt was forcibly taken from a jail cell in the city by an angry mob that hanged him from a telegraph pole on the square. News accounts say a fire was built beneath his feet while he was still alive. A crowd later cut down Wyatt&rsquo;s burning body and beat and stabbed it, leaving the remains to burn, drawing a substantial crowd.</i></p></i><p>In other words, a white superintendent of schools was wantonly murdered when he refused to re-certify an incompetent black &#8220;teacher&#8221;:  that&rsquo;s the reason Wyatt was lynched over 100 years ago.  As far as the race situation in this country is concerned,the more things change, the more they stay the same.

		<p>I think &#8216;the one&rsquo; BO should have a milkshake summit with these students and see if he can&rsquo;t straighten out the black kids for a change. I hope the white kid sues the school. Don&rsquo;t be too hard on the bus driver&hellip; it is a crumby low-paying job and the driver was probably a tiny oriental woman like the line person the Amazon Williams cursed at during the tennis match. </p>

		<p> Show me a school where there is a significant minority of blacks, that DOESN&rsquo;T have racial tension, and I&rsquo;ll show you Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, live and in color. As to this &#8220;witness&#8221; who the reporter seems to think is so unimpeachable, well, he&rsquo;s black, too; you can tell that by his name. So what do you think he&rsquo;s going to say?</p>
<p> Even if the blacks didn&rsquo;t actually yell &#8220;racial slurs,&#8221; as the mainstream media always calls them, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the kid didn&rsquo;t get beaten up just for being White. I spent three years in the Army with blacks, and if you&rsquo;re White, there is an element among them that will try to take an advantage over you if they can, will try to humiliate you by catching you when you&rsquo;re in some type of vulnerable situation, then beating on you or trying to intimidate you in some other way.</p>
<p> Does anyone believe that the police would have so quickly backed off their original (correct) assessment of racial motivation, if the thugs had been White, and the victim black? Ha!We all know the answer to that! I was surprised that Fox News, which is admittedly gutsier than the other media about calling a spade a spade, noted in their initial report that the perpetrators were black and the victim White. I&rsquo;m anxious to see if they&rsquo;ve changed their tune now. </p>

		<p>I wrote this Capt. Sax an email and told him explicitly that many people were getting fed up with the so-called elites trying to act as diplomats and cover up black on white attacks because they think it&rsquo;s up to them to stop a racial war by cooling out whites.</p>
<p>I told him his job was to uphold the law.  It was not trying to do our thinking for us by telling us what he thinks we should know.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t post the email here, because it contains wording that wouldn&rsquo;t get by the moderator.  (No, it was nothing that could get me sent to jail, but it was plenty harsh, as well it should have been.)</p>

Using that analogy the we can ask what did the kid do to get beat up? After all there where other small white kids on that bus as well and none of them received a beating. Infact most of them laughed at the beating. </p>

		<p>once again, my apologies for no cap&rsquo;s and punctuation d/t a bad keyboard.</p>
<p>from the looks of this and other similar incidents in the last few years including the jena 6, witchita massacre, knoxville horror and the presley killing in arkansas, it appears that police just will not pursue &#8221;racially motivated&#8221; attacks of whites by blacks&hellip;even if it devolves into a case of gruesome, gristly and obviously hateful murders. they just will not do it.</p>
<p>something should be done by the boy&rsquo;s parents via some sort of legal action. what is the threshold of guilt of a racially motivated crime. apparently it is different for blacks than it is whites. blacks can torture their victims for days and butcher them in an unnecessarily brutal way and no hate crime. any crime done by a white to a black - however rare they happen nowadays - is suspect and throroughly investigated..and in many cases prosecuted as a hate crime. what about the reginald denny case in the rodney king riots. those thugs got intent to commit murder but were they prosecuted for hate crimes. i think not.</p>
<p>no doubt race relations will continue to get worse as the white pot reaches the boiling point.</p>

<p>So we know Belleville had a history of racial turmoil. Yet, this attack isn&rsquo;t racially motivated.</p>
<p>Why bring this up in context of this attack?</p>
<p>It appears to me that they&rsquo;re using past incidents by whites to excuse or justify this attack by blacks. It does seem that this is being defined as a kind of payback.</p>

		<p>I am so sick of having weak-kneed, double-chinned, cowardly dough-boys (like the good Captain Sax) as the front page representation of white men. No wonder whites are singled out for attack. </p>
<p>And&hellip;I&rsquo;m single and I don&rsquo;t have children, so please forgive me if I&rsquo;m out of line with this comment, but I never saw the young white victim on the bus throw any punches in return. Did I miss him fighting back? </p>

		<p>So right, #3.  We see, right here, how Belleville blacks behave, today. It&rsquo;s not a stretch to imagine that this is how they behaved in 1903.</p>
<p> All the media wants to give us, for background information, is the horrible things some white people did in the distant past.  They are trying to set up the information to give the impression that this child somehow deserves to be brutally attacked. If the kid did not receive permanent physical damage from this, it is an absolute certainty that his psychological state will be forever compromised.  Something like this is every bit as bad as rape.</p>
<p> Articles like this one are why I don&rsquo;t buy newspapers.</p>

		<p>Of course it was not a hate crime, these kind of things never are according to authorities. If it were my kid that was beaten to a pulp I would sue the school and the bus driver for failing to protect my kid. As I have said before, reason 1,000,000 to homeschool your kids. </p>

		<p>#3, in answer to your question, the man man lynched, Davis S. Wyatt, a schoolteacher walked into the office of the superintendent of schools and shot him. It appears that the superintendent, on Charles Hertel had refused to renew Wyatts teaching certificate because of &#8220;grievous&#8221; complaints. It would seem that back behaviour has not changed one iota in 100 years.</p>

		<p>There is a reason every advanced culture for 6000 years has segregated blacks from our midst.They are dangerous and impulsive. They defend the most despicable acts if committed by their own. This 40 year window of integration Hell we have all lived through will result in another 6000 years of segregation. </p>

		<p>I used to ride the public school bus in high school back in the 70&rsquo;s, and apparently not much has changed in 30 years. I would note that the victim in this video, like the white victims in other videos of attacks on public transportation posted on this site, appears rather eloi-like(see H.G. Wells&rsquo; &#8220;The Time Machine&#8221;) and puts up little if any fight until the very end. My impression is that he was picked on, not solely because he was white, but because he was perceived to be weak. For most blacks, &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221; mean the same thing. He should have stood his ground and fought back immediately. How much worse could it get? If blacks think you&rsquo;re a stand-up guy who will fight,they tend to respect that and leave you be. Acting like Jesus on the way to Calvary doesn&rsquo;t work.                          </p>

		<p>I Graduated from West last year and bus fights used to happen, but they never made the news. In a fight that happened a couple years ago on my bus, the bus was pulled over and the offenders went with the police.  It is also just terrible that blacks can get away with ever they want but luckily I did not have to deal with them because I was in honors classes. </p>

		<p>Being as this is close to home, I think I can add something useful to this conversation.</p>
<p>In 1991, the CBS news magazine 60 Minutes did a hit piece on Belleville, which, at the time, was a nice white/Kraut Metro East community.  But it shared a western border with East St. Louis, and tried a lot of tricks to prevent ESL blacks from moving to Belleville and messing up another town in the Metro East.  When CBS said jump, the Bush 41 Administration said How High?  Of course that&rsquo;s to be expected from the Stupid Party.  The Just-Us department made Belleville eliminate is physical and other barriers, and the flood began.</p>
<p>That a bus full of high school students from Belleville West High School has only one black indicates to me that the western half of Belleville is now majority black.  Which would make sense, b/c the western part of BV is closer to East St. Louis.  The eastern half and its HS is still mostly white.</p>
<p>The authorities are wondering why the bus driver didn&rsquo;t pull over and stop the beating.  Two theories:  (1) S/he is black, and approved of a hate crime on a white teenager, (2) S/he is black, but was rightfully scared to intervene, because it would have been 25 high school students against one adult, (3) S/he is white, and had similar feelings to (2), or (4) S/he is white, and was scared to intervene for racial reasons.</p>
<p>There are any number of well-known white people who were actually born and raised in East St. Louis, that do everything they can to cover up where they were from, as it would be too much of an embarrassment.  Jimmy Connors always says he was from Belleville, when the truth of the matter is that he was born and raised in ESL, but later moved to Belleville when the usual suspect that chewed through ESL are now chewing through Belleville.  In fact, the ESL house that Connors lived in, and the tennis court that his parents built for him on their property, are both still in good condition.  I would assume that a black man or woman now owns the house, and is keeping it up because they&rsquo;re speculating on Jimmy Connors perhaps buying the property in the future for sentimental value.</p>
<p>Senator Dick Durbin and Governor Pat Quinn were also born in East St. Louis.</p>
<p>The St. Louis media are now trying to downplay this crime as mere &#8220;bullying.&#8221;  Which would be like calling the Pope just a Catholic Priest.</p>

		<p>34 Mike:  Glad you chimed in.  I mistyped above, I should have said that there was only one WHITE student on a bus as an indication of west BV&rsquo;s demographics.  Am I right about eastern BV still?  I moved from St. Louis to Carbondale at the first of the year for a new job, but of course I keep up on STL news.  On one of my trips back from STL to Carbondale, (I&rsquo;m back in STL most weekends), I took the long route to stop by a, shall we say, &#8220;firearms exposition&#8221; at Belle-Clair.  It&rsquo;s easy to tell that west BV is black/crummy, but east BV still looks pretty decent.  Of course most white former west BVians moved not to east BV, but to O&rsquo;Fallon and Fairview Hts.  I think they saw the writing on the wall for all of BV.  Of course what might save east BV is that it doesn&rsquo;t have very many apartments like west BV does, apartments are essentially the beachhead of racial replacement.  This might well keep Belleville East HS majority white for a long time to come.</p>

		<p>If a white guy even gives a hard looks at a black,  it&rsquo;s racist.  However,  blacks can almost beat a white kid to death and it NOT racist.  The case in Knoxville  is another example.  Two young white kids were on a date when they were car jacked/kidnapped/raped, tortured and murdered by blacks.  Just like this case the police said it had nothing to do with race.  The boy was raped and murdered.  The girl was raped for days in every possible way by several black males and then beaten with a chair leg and forced to drink beach.  She was then placed in a plastic bag and stuffed head down in a trash can where she slowly sufficated. The Knoxville authorities said it had nothing at all to do with race. Apparently the police believed that they were just some high spirited blacks out for a good time.   Gimme a break!  <br>

<p>I looked up Belleville.  It was once 90% of German descent&hellip; (as was E. St. Louis).  I see that Belleville is 81% white and 15% black, and that it lies direct adjascent to East St. Louis which is (by now) 98% black!!! </p>

		<p>&#8220;something should be done by the boy&rsquo;s parents via some sort of legal action. what is the threshold of guilt of a racially motivated crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a criminal lawyer but I think the test that should apply is the &#8220;but for&#8221; test.  That is, but for the victim&rsquo;s race, would the attack have occurred?  This should eliminate the possibility of using any other possible motive to rule out hatred.  For example, if a person is mugged and then beaten to death, the stealing of the wallet should not prevent a hate motive finding, if it can be shown that the victim would not have been targeted for robbery and assault if s/he was from another race.  That is the only way to make it fair.  </p>
<p>If you are determined, you can always find some other motive to distract from anti-white hatred.  If you watch this video, it appears that this white student was expected to ask permission before taking a seat next to a student.  But noone wanted to offer him a seat.  Finally, he just moved a kid&rsquo;s backpack out of the way and sat down.  That was his grievous offense.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to look at it that way, no crime against whites will ever be racially motivated.  If we just suck up to them enough, we won&rsquo;t be attacked.  Therefore, when we are brutally attacked, it wasn&rsquo;t because of our skin color, but our lack of respect.  </p>
<p>That simply makes no sense.  I would think that any honest liberal would have to admit that the very essence of a hate crime is the use of intimidation and violence to keep uppity members of a despised group from asserting their equality and rights.  But then, I&rsquo;m trying to use logic, when we all know its really about political correctness.</p>

		<p>The driver keeps the bus rolling. Was the driver black?</p>
<p>The few whites are paralyzed, fully brainwashed into cowardice. The whites of 60 years ago and farther back in time would never have sat still, even if outnumbered. Those of you who went to school with blacks and mestizos as I did in L.A. know that for the most part, even when a group jumps on one white, if a few other whites jump in to help ( or anyone really ), the non-whites generally back off. They do not like getting hit back. </p>
<p>Pack animals. Let roam free by the marxists. I saw the same behavior by the mexicans as well s well as the blacks when I was in jr and sr high. I also noted the blacks would rarely attack a latino because the latinos would immediately all rally and begin cracking black heads. The filipinos would do the same. Most whites have been brainwashed into being cowards, into turning the other cheek, and they also <b>know</b> they have a lot to lose, while the laughing non-whites will get off with a wrist-slap. The backtracking by the police capt. &#8220;&hellip;it may not have been racially motivated,&#8221; is so typical. He needs his estrogen levels checked. Seems the good captain needs to receive a dose of the racial reality medicine this poor boy on the bus did. </p>
<p>No one fears whites at the moment. The only place whites are feared is in prison, meaning the white prison gangs. The blacks and mexicans avoid physical confrontation with the Aryan Brotherhood, the Pen1, the Peckerwoods because they know they will be hit back or worse - and the whites are far more organized, even though outnumbered. In fact, the mexicans respect the AB etc. and run many &#8220;games&#8221; with them, siding with them against the blacks. When the big collapse hits, whites better shed the brainwashing and be ready to come out swinging, because the marxists&rsquo; foot soldiers, dolts like the blacks on the bus, will be doling out worse. The only good thing is the non-whites see their marxist handlers as just another bunch of whites who need to &#8220;get theirs too&#8221;. And the non-whites will give it to them despite arrogant thoughts to the contrary. That will be fun to see. </p>

		<p>The police decided today that the attack was not racially motivated; rather, it was simply over a seat on the bus.  Speaking as former prey on a school bus just like the one in this story, I can assure you that bus seating is a common excuse to terrorize white kids.</p>
<p>As I have posted here before, I was forced to ride the school bus from the suburb where I lived to the inner city back in the &rsquo;70s as part of &#8220;desegregation.&#8221;</p>
<p>I vividly recall watching the clock in my last class of the day, packing up all my schoolbooks 15 minutes in advance of the bell so that I could sprint for the bus line.  I knew that being late to board the bus put me at the mercy of the black kids in the back.  If the teacher told me I was needed after class for a few minutes, it was terrifying.</p>
<p>Often white kids would sit like sardines four to a seat while the devils, smoking refer and plotting whatever malicious mischief they could cook up, had seats to themselves in the back.</p>
<p>If that boy&rsquo;s parents saw the school bus he was about to board, and they let him get on it, they should be charged with negligence.  It would have been more responsible to let him swim across a river full of alligators than to get on that bus.  At least alligators will only attack you if they&rsquo;re hungry.</p>

I don&rsquo;t see how this attack could not have been racially motivated - a lone white kid is attacked by a mob of cheering blacks for no apparent reason, what other explanation is there?

		<p>&#8220;A Belleville police spokesman now says an incident where a white student was beaten by teen black assailants on a bus &ldquo;may not be racially motivated.&rdquo;</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Time after time, we see the police bend over backwards (perhaps under political pressure?) in their efforts to claim that a black-on-white crime was not racial.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they will do everything they possibly can to establish that a white-on-black &#8220;crime&#8221; (or even minor incident) WAS  racially motivated.</p>

 Be that as it may, I seriously doubt that if any of the aggressors featured in the video were cognizant of those &#8216;facts&rsquo; or were acting out of vengeance.<br>
  So why print it? - Firstly it&rsquo;s sloppy journalism of the worst type forever playing the &#8216;boo-hoo-hoo&rsquo; exulted victim status upon an officially legally priveleged and protected group - Whitey must never be allowed to get too uppity and must be slapped down (and here&rsquo;s the clincher) when he is unequivocally and incontrovertibly the victim.<br>
 Secondly by invoking this semi-mytholigical &#8216;dismemberment&rsquo; this wretched newspaper furmly nails its &#8216;liberal&rsquo; colors to the mast and shows in the prevailing perversity of American mass media that the paper are the &#8216;good-guys&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>A lot of these posts seem to be trying to justify the lynching. It was barbaric and cruel to an extreme. it involved the most horrible torture imagineable and then the total desecration of the body.<br>
No crime justified it. It is unacceptable by a civilization with a bare minimum of humanity. If you accept it you cannot make a case against the rascistt asault on the kid in the bus.<br>

		<p>My friends and I had a term to describe a phenomenon that we observed and that I&rsquo;m sure most American whites are at least unconsciously familiar with: negritude.  It describes the proportion of blacks in a particular public space and their corresponding propensity for unruly behavior, which rises proportionally with the fraction of the population they represent in said particular space.  Get one or two blacks here or there surrounded by many whites, say, in your average college campus, law firm, or newspaper editorial office, and the level of negritude is low: the blacks tend to police themselves.  Get more of them together, where they are in a position where they see more of each other around and fewer whites, and the likelihood of unruly behavior rises.  Witness a public bus, retail store, or department of motor vehicles office in most American cities.  Go into a black ghetto, where the level of negritude approaches 100%, and you have entered the most unruly and dangerous places in the country.</p>
<p>What I wonder, given the incumbent face we now see in the White House and his associated coterie, is if the general base-level of negritude throughout the country, insofar as it affects the behavior of blacks, has risen; or, conversely, if the overall base-level constraints on black misbehavior haven&rsquo;t been generally lowered as a result.  See e.g., Acorn; see also Van Jones; Henry Louis Gates; Serena Williams; Kanye West; Michael Jordan.  It may be that Obama&rsquo;s election has had some subliminal and unconscious effect on blacks generally that has led them to act as if the whole country now is as accommodating a place to their misbehavior as Harlem or the west side of Chicago would be.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Are we as white men failing to be the right sort of role model?&#8221; </p>
<p>YES</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must teach our children and grandchildren to be AWARE of the dangers of entering into a situation where there are multiple Africans then take the necessary steps to AVOID the Africans.</p>
<p>Second, if your precious children MUST be in the Government Re-education camps (AKA, NEA controlled public schools), they must be trained and even equipted with weapons. This will enable the third part of the example ESCALATE under control.</p>
<p>The training should be in a practical type of martial arts like Krav Maga:  <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.kravmaga.com/</a></p>
<p>The weapon can be easily disguised, like this Sap Cap.</p>

<p>European American men need to train the children AND set the example by practicing the AWARE, AVOID and ESCALATE.</p>

		<p>I have also noticed that kids in most of these taped beatings do not do a darn thing to defend themselves. My grandmother always told me that if I started a fight then I would be in trouble at home but if I was attacked and did not defend myself then I was also in trouble at home. One of the problems is a philosophy called &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; that is prevelent in schools today. Basically this states that kids that are caught &#8220;fighting&#8221; are both punished, both the perpetrator and victim are often suspended or expelled. Much of the time this also includes cases where one or several students attack another student without him or her defending himself. I would hesitate to give a student a weapon as was suggested, if they were caught with it they could get in a real world of trouble, up to and including a criminal record that will NEVER go away. The best bet would be to get your kids out of public schools. If you were a kid whose parents could or would not get him out of a school like this then I would quit as soon as legally possible, get a job and a GED and get some sort of post secondary education be it in the military, community college or vocational school. </p>

		<p> I grew up in Metro East. My parents took a loss on selling our house so we could move out of ESL proper, into the relative safety of the suburbs.  The informal name for the law enforcement agencies around ESL is &#8220;The White Fence&#8221; because they spend so much time just trying to keep up with the black crime wave in their communities.  My brothers went all the way through high school in ESL, and had fights with the blacks on the buses way back in the 50&rsquo;s. But that was before ESL was completely over run, and white kids ( and adults) still had guts and fought back. As for #21&rsquo;s comments-these black kids know there&rsquo;s a camera on the bus-they probably aren&rsquo;t going to kill or cripple anyone in front of the camera. Yes, if anyone broke up the fight it would be a black. The white kids are obviously outnumbered, and trying to pretend nothing is happening. They have been successfully neutered. Look at that skinny white kid and tell me how likely it is that he was pushing anyone around or &#8220;taking their seat&#8221;. As has been said already, this scene plays out daily thousands of times around the country, and guess who the aggressors invariably are? I hope you&rsquo;re a liberal troll, because otherwise you&rsquo;re another white conservative who has lost his reason and his courage.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think they were &#8220;trying to justify&#8221; any lynching. They were trying to establish that the lynching  <b><i>had a reason  </i></b>(which the article conveniently left unmentioned).  Thus they were merely filling in the missing part of the story that the journalist purposely omitted. I certainly don&rsquo;t excuse lynching, or approve of it.  But I don&rsquo;t think the journalist should have mentioned it either, since it was irrelevant. That&rsquo;s dishonest reporting.</p>
<p>The posters were basically asking why it was necessary even to bring up an event that happened over a century ago!  One that was unrelated to this incident.  To what purpose?  What is the relevance?   Obviously, the jouralist was setting the stage, working up sympathy for the bus attackers, as if this represents a case of justified retribution that&rsquo;s fully understandable,  and getting us prepped  for the rest of the story that was to come.   Otherwise, why mention anything about lynching  at all? (or traffic tickets, or civil service hiring &hellip; all of which would not have been experienced by these young kids).</p>
<p>That was entirely gratuitous and irrelevant to the story.  It was propaganda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Negritude&#8221; also affects White behaviour as well.  Here in the UK, with a Black population overall of around 2-5%, kids are becoming more and more unruly, violent, disrespectful, slovenly, lazy, rude and arrogant. The number of kids who speak in &#8220;Jafaican&#8221; (Google it), makes me seethe.  Standards and expectations  in schools are rock bottom.  Any attempt to instill discipline or pride in themselves or their school, for example by enforcing a strict uniform code, is met with howls of indignation and threats of legal action from parents.   Not only kids, either, even adults.  No one will, if they do something wrong, just put their hands up and say &#8220;sorry, my fault&#8221;.  Instead, you get verbal abuse, justifications as to why they did it, and in many cases, extreme violence over the most trivial altercations.   </p>

		<p>The key word here is &#8220;assalilants&#8221;, anytime a person is attacked by a group there is a reason for it. You may be attacked by one person that just loses his/her temper for whatever reason but that&rsquo;s not going to happen to several people all at once, there is some motivation behind the attack. If it&rsquo;s not racially motived then let them give another reason. I sure would be interested in hearing why a group of people jumped and beat one guy. </p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s that anytime blacks see anyone ( especially a white person) in a helpless position they feel they all need to get involved in a beat down. The only thing that ever scares the heck out of a black is the thought they may ever have to fight anyone fair and square. That&rsquo;s why they have drive by shootings, they are already moving away from the incident.  Blacks are a very cowardly breed and cowards are the most dangerous people on earth if they ever get you in a bad position. </p>

<p>From the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/qjwyxy" rel="nofollow">NY Times, June 8, 1903</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been the most exciting day Belleville has known in years, as the result of the lynching last night of David J. Wyatt, the East St. Louis school teacher, who fatally shot Charles Hertel, Superintendent of Schools of St. Clair County, at 6 o&rsquo;clock Saturday evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>They lynched the man who shot the superintendent of schools, hardly a random act of senseless violence.</p>
<p>By the way, someone should do a study of whites who were lynched.  A cursory google search turns up many newspaper accounts of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mx4rxq" rel="nofollow">whites who were lynched</a> for murder.  </p>

<p>A junior high school I attended in Alexandria, Va. in 1955 was the roughest of about 8 public schools I attended in the South. The &#8220;hard rocks&#8221; there greased their ducktails back with black shoe polish, and met after school to have one-on-one fights. I remember one of them  courteously asking me (it wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;Big Roach&#8221; or &#8220;Little Roach,&#8221; the school&rsquo;s two toughest hard rocks, but some other whose name I forget) if I&rsquo;d like to join them.

		<p>First, black kids almost never attack whites unless they are certain the whites cannot adequately defend themselves. In this case it was one white kid in the midst of a dozen thugs. (Remember Reginald Denny?)</p>
<p>Second, when white kids try to defend themselves, the black kids take this as a challenge and things get worse   &mdash;   much worse. </p>
<p>What is needed is system in which white kids don&rsquo;t have to be subjected to those who are incapable of assimilating into civil society.</p>
<p>Before you blame the white kids for lack of self defense, place yourself in his situation. </p>
<p>Do the following &hellip;</p>
<p>Hop on a bus crowded with white-hating black thugs who have no concept of civility. Note the only seat available is in the midst of these thugs. One of the thugs refuses to allow you to have that seat, placing his back-pack where you need to sit. Politely ask him to move his back-pack and, when he refuses, have a seat anyhow. </p>
<p>When all hell breaks lose, defend yourself and tell us all how it came out.</p>

<p><br>
Because white kids are taught that if they fight back they are punished just as much if not (and commonly) more so than the attackers.</p>
<p>I saw this back in the 70&rsquo;s and early 80&rsquo;s even. I was picked on when I was small for my age in the 6th grade but after a growth spurt that was never going to happen again to me nor to anyone I knew. Yet everytime I got into a fight, even in defense I was punished the same as the agressor.</p>
<p>This is the result of 40 years of de-masculating white boys. Any white boy that shows any hint of standing up for themselves, others or having any gender pride or the ability to think for themselves against the leftist/feminist programming is weeded out long before they can ride a school bus at 17.</p>
<p>very sad.</p>

		<p>Those of you who are blaming the white student for not &#8220;fighting back&#8221;&hellip;give me a break! Fight back against 50 attackers? I don&rsquo;t care if your belt is black, brown, white, green or purple, trying to fight back against 50 black thugs is only going to make the beating worse. Those of you who think you could hold off 50 black attackers, nstead of a few bruises or a broken nose, you would&rsquo;ve had to have your jaw wired shut, or perhaps permanent brain damage. </p>
<p>Some of you seem to be just as deluded as the PC apologists. Blacks don&rsquo;t respect anything except separation. Multiple attackers don&rsquo;t patiently wait their turn like they do in those puerile Asian kung-fu movies. This is just another case of blaming the white victim. He actually did more for our cause by NOT  fighting back, and preventing the claim that it was &#8220;his fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as for the claim that whites were also laughing at the attack, I only saw one or two other whites in the video, and their backs were turned towards the camera. Yes, a light-skinned black or hispanic did come to the victim&rsquo;s aid, but one out of 50 doing the right thing is a very poor track record.</p>

		<p> &#8220;One of the problems is a philosophy called &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; that is prevelent in schools today. Basically this states that kids that are caught &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; are both punished, both the perpetrator and victim are often suspended or expelled.&#8221;<br>
- Spartan24</p>
<p>This is because spineless school officials fear to make a judgement wherever blacks and whites are involved. They can&rsquo;t absolve whites and punish blacks, and usually blacks areto blame. Officlais are terrified of accusations of racism or favoritism.  That allegation could end their careers.  So they cop out by suspending both parties and punishing them equally.  </p>
<p>In other cases, it also makes it easier for lazy officials to avoid having to investigate thoroughly and come to a firm conclusion as who was right or wrong.   That&rsquo;s awkward because it places them on the spot. It&rsquo;s guaranteed to earn the anger of one set of parents or the other. (And who needs the anger of an enraged black mother?)  It&rsquo;s just easier and safer to punish both and call it justice.</p>

		<p>The twisted, tortured &#8216;logic&rsquo; of the writer of this piece seems to imply that the &#8216;lynching&rsquo; of 100 years ago (which the perpetrator of the assault was probably completely unaware of)somehow justifies spontaneous unprovoked aggression against Whites simply because they are White.<br>
 This is not only an appalling position for any responsible adult to ever harbor, let alone publicize - most particularly a &#8216;professional&rsquo; such as a journalist whose job is intimately involved in inciting public opinion, but legally and morally this &#8216;principle&rsquo; has always and universally been execrated as being not only utterly worthless but being positively evil.<br>
  - For example it would be held as ridiculous if a 3rd generation Polish American randomly physically assaulted an American with a German surname invoking the actions of the Wehrmacht in 1939-45 as a &#8216;justification&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I have to wonder what kind of liberal mush head parents would let their kids ride the bus with so many blacks or even send them to that school.  I can look at the crowd on that bus and know right away that school has gone to pot.  My kids are grown now but I would never have allowed them to be placed in such a situation.  We drove our kids to school and later paid for private school when the demographics in the district started changing.</p>

		<p>Contention between socio-ethnic groupings located in close proximity to each other is bound to happen.  And it can be white-on-black too.  The difference is that it is going to happen with disproportionate frequency as black-on-white because of higher testosterone levels, lower IQs plus the sense of injustice/entitlemnt fed to blacks by the media.  And the supinizing effect the latter message has on whites.  </p>
<p>White southerners knew something about integration, and knew that integration would bring outcomes like the above (it was common sense even).  Segregationists either did not see or tended to discount the *benefits* of integration.  But they were well within their rights to &#8220;play it safe&#8221; when it came to their cherished values, tradition and stability.</p>
<p>Whatever valid excuses may be made for the violence we see on this tape (environmental factors, poor policy decisions), white Belleville parents ought to be hearing a very loud Poltergeist calling, &#8220;Get Out&#8221;.  This violence is the tip of a very deep iceberg of problems that can have a negative effect on your child&rsquo;s upbringing.  </p>
<p>Race realists should not hesitate to point out the ironies here with the Rosa Parks case.  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch is offering us a sub-headline: &#8220;Choice of seat, not victim&rsquo;s color, sparked attack, witness and police say&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s like saying &#8220;Choice of seat, not victim&rsquo;s color, sparked Rosa Parks arrest&#8221;. Hey Mr. Newspaperman!  How about, &#8220;Choice of seat *and* race sparked attack&#8221;? These newspapers are weak on principles of logic.  Or more accurately, &#8220;Choice of Seat over Floor and Race Sparked Attack.&#8221; At least Rosa got a seat!  And was not throttled like a farm animal.</p>

		<p>Much of the white youth culture has been emasculated by feminist teachings over the past 30 yrs or so. I believe this feminist teaching is also largely responsible for a great deal of the unnatural sexual deviency in our culture &hellip;as white males have been robbed of there self respect starting in grade schools systematically and constantly insulted by accusing their natural intellectual aggressiveness as something wrong. The different programs to innitiate girls into the naturally masculine fields of the hard sciences coupled with having young boys walk around in class with a baby he&rsquo;s supposed to be nurturing etc..Men becoming nurses, women doctors&hellip; much of the details I have little knowledge of but I&rsquo;ve seen it clear as day for the past decades as well as the deformed male identity&rsquo;s and their consequent deformed sexual appetites, this video of a whiteboy without an identity to defend&hellip; We&rsquo;ve come a long way baby!</p>

		<p> I rarely post on this site, however I do browse this page frequently. This beatdown on an innocent white kid pisses me off.<br>
 I have a 16 year old son who started the school year recently in a predominately white public school. However every year they bus people of color to his school &#8220;Diversity&#8221;. At the start of the year my son had a punk and his friends call him out in school in front of fellow students. My son agreed to accommodate this punk and his friends after football practice. Keep in mind it was these loser punks first year at this school. At the agreed time and place my son brought fellow football team members with him (we all know they are alot braver when the odds are 5 to 1). Which I have preached to my kids for years.<br>
 Well too sum it up they got it on, what this bully punk did not realize is that my son is a 2 time state champion wrestler. Needless to say this punk bully learned the art of submission. In a matter of minutes this punk was crying like a baby screaming for mercy as his pack looked on in awe. Thank god he had the brains to bring the average 6&rsquo;-4&#8221; 280Ib offensive line with him to keep the odds even.<br>
 The bark is always bigger than the bite with these punks.</p>

		<p>Something has GOT to give or something is going to happen that is really bad.  There is no level of trust in this country.  During the last election, all the radical elements that surround Obama were poo-poo&rsquo;d by his supporters.  We were told &#8220;Oh no!  That&rsquo;s silly!!  That&rsquo;s all lies that he associates with these so called &#8216;radicals&rsquo;&#8221;   &mdash;  - only to have him one by one put them in place after winning the election and openly pursue their radical agenda.   It&rsquo;s the same with trust among the races.  WHITES get hammered for generations about tolerance and understanding and the SLIGHTEST disagreement between them and a BLACK or ANY minority is assailed with charges of racism.  ALL THAT while time and time and time again racist words and actions in the minority groups goes unchecked.<br>
It&rsquo;s really really bad - and getting worse, not better!  Jackson and Sharpton - if they were REALLY about equality - would have been up in arms and out in front of every camera denouncing the actions of those thugs JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH DON IMUS!!  And the BLACK community should be equally enraged and demanding action   &mdash;   if they were REALLY believing what they espoused during the &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; movement&hellip;..</p>

<p>I was forced into that kind of hellhole for 3 long years of my life in Jr. High.I went to a 98% black school.Most of those thugs are long dead now or in prison. The worst of the bunch died of AIDS in prison a few years back.He killed a convenience store clerk a few days after turning 18. Two others are back in prison after a short furlogh where they quickly resumed selling drugs.I know another died in his early 20&rsquo;s just like his other 4 brothers I am told.The one who tried to kill my broter with a knife was shot in the back of the head years ago after molesting another mans wife..God I feel for this poor kid, he has to go back to that damn place tomorrow.<br>
I guarantee you the judge, the police chief, the principle,the school superintendent, the school board,congressman,town council,county board,juvenile court,FBI,OSHA,bus driver,district superintendent,ACLU,SPLC,State Senator,County Sheriff, Governor,Lt.Governor,School Counselor,etc. soesn&rsquo;t gives a damn that this kid has to go back and sit in the same classroom, walk the same halls,go into the same bathrooms as his tormentors. If one of those entities..ONE..cared and interfered on his behalf he would be transferred to a civilzed(white) school. He&rsquo;ll be one of us.    </p>

		<p>Re: lynching.  </p>
<p>There are two possible deterrents that I can think of.  A) The severity of judicial punishment and b) lynching, a form of swift extra-judicial (and therefore not-so-just) justice.  It has always been accepted that outsiders, interlopers, etc. do not get the same form of justice (expensive and lengthy trial by jury of peers, beyond a reasonable doubt standard) as people rooted in the community.  (This is what we saw with the recent Guantanamo arguments from the justice department.) Therefore, there were lynchings in the West in the 19th century (exacerbated by the added expense and impracticality of regular justice) and lynchings of blacks who were viewed as interlopers because of the separation of the communities.</p>
<p>Lynchings needed to be (and have been) eradicated (except for the informal ones like those &#8220;judges&#8221; administering seat-justice on Illinois school buses).  But their deterrent effect must be acknowledged.  As must be their necessity in situations where the Natural Law demands justice but the same formalities that attain in civilized areas are not practical.</p>
<p>Fault can be found with white southerners for not realizing that Southern blacks, although different in many important respects including perhaps their overall reverence for the very same trappings of Anglo-American jurispudnce at issue, were as rooted in the South as they could be as ex-slaves and were in no way johnny-come-latelys.  </p>
<p><br>
and in no way  </p>

 &#8220;A lot of these posts seem to be trying to justify the lynching.  We should all have our basic human rights commonly protected. I am sure there are laws against the premeditated murder of your boss which should have been applied.&#8221;<br>

<p>How nice of you to think so, Mr. Stuart.  That&rsquo;s so very kind!   Do you also think that the hundreds of thousands of whites living today who are annually victimized  by blacks deserve to have their &#8220;basic human rights&#8221; protected?  So why don&rsquo;t they?   Or do you prefer to dwell instead on whatever happened a century ago, closing your eyes to the present?   Do you think these victims  (who are NOT murderers and are innocent of anything)  are also entitled to equal protyection of the law?   Unfortunately, the  crime statistics tell us they aren&rsquo;t!  Nor do they enjoy equal justice in the courts,  if the criminal is apprehended and the case comes to trial.   Just ask the Brown and Goldman families about that   &mdash;  - among countless others. Amren wouldn&rsquo;t have the space to list them all. </p>
<p>Yet you&rsquo;re distracted by concern for what happened to a murdered black man who was himself A MURDERER, 106 years ago!  I guess that&rsquo;s called black logic.  </p>

<p>&#8220;A junior high school I attended in Alexandria, Va. in 1955 was the roughest of about 8 public schools I attended in the South. The &ldquo;hard rocks&rdquo; there greased their ducktails back with black shoe polish, and met after school to have one-on-one fights. I remember one of them courteously asking me (it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Big Roach&rdquo; or &ldquo;Little Roach,&rdquo; the school&rsquo;s two toughest hard rocks, but some other whose name I forget) if I&rsquo;d like to join them. I declined, and that was accepted without even a cutting remark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; This culture rather continued a ways into the 60s, even in Northern California, where I grew up.  I had to fight a couple bullies, but no one jumped in to help anyone.  Mostly, other kids watched the show and maybe rooted for one or the other.  There was a kind of system of honor about fights.  So strict was it, that if someone kicked, or used anything but their fists, it was considered &#8220;dirty fighting&#8221; and the perp was viewed as a bad kid in general from then on.  Later, with more &#8220;diversity&#8221; kicking began and by 1971, our high school had its very own race riots.</p>
<p>I also can remember the &#8220;Hards&#8221; as they were termed in our region.  They wore leather jackets and were a bit scary, but they really weren&rsquo;t that bad, maybe stole some bubble gum or broke a bottle on the street during their high school days.  What they seemed to constitute was a kind of &#8220;fight club.&#8221;  They liked to fight and get the adrenlin rush from the danger of it.  Most of them never got into any real trouble because they had mothers and fathers at home.  They might have been backward parents or dysfunctional families, but there was very little divorce in those days.  In more urban areas, it was probably worse.  WE know that London was worse in the early 1960s and New York already had rival gangs, etc., but most of America was not like that.</p>

<p>Note the words grievous complaints.  Not incompetent work, absenteeism etc, but grievous complaints.  He probably sexually assaulted his students, white and black both.  That&rsquo;s probably what grievous complaint means.  Or else ferocious corporal punishment or both.</p>

		<p>Whenever a White tries to defend himself against 4 or 5 blacks he is accused of racism and assault and his parents will have to pay a fortune in legal fees to defend him in juvenile court.  I mean a $3,000 retainer just to get a defense attorney and a $10,00 or more bill at the end. </p>
<p>And of course the White kid will be suspended from school.</p>
<p>I am very militant, extreme and radical.  </p>
<p>But much as I hate to say it, it is better for a white to take a beating quietly than get into the legal troubles that occur when a White defends himself.  Remember the White guy named Nick something in New York who fought off the thugs who stole his car.  I think he got a 20 year sentence for hate crime.  And of course the ADL ACLU $PLC NYTIMES were responsible for pushing the district attorney to file charges of hate crime for trying to recover his stolen car.</p>
<p>Get your kids out of public school if you can.  Send them to relatives, anything to keep them away from the blacks who assault, rape and beat them with impunity.  Our people are helots and the blacks predators are the spartan youths who kept the helots in line.</p>

<p>Good point. I was reading, somewhere, that some families opt to send their kid(s) to school by taxi.  That&rsquo;s very nice for them, but not everyone can afford to do that.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, those sheltered kids who go to school by taxi  (or whose parents drive them) are only having a temporary reprieve from harsh reality.  It won&rsquo;t last. Eventually, they will have to get out in the real world and survive  on their own. They&rsquo;re going to encounter people like those blacks, and much worse ones too.  Mommy and daddy won&rsquo;t be able to drive them everywhere forever.  </p>
<p>They need to learn to protect themselves.</p>

<p><br>
Exactly.  I am all for self-defense.   But sometimes it can be very costly, maybe more  than it&rsquo;s worth    &mdash;   especially when the system is rigged against you. And our present system is.</p>
<p>Despite what we all know deep inside,  about black aggression and black crime,  the government  that we have  presumes all whites to be basically &#8220;racist&#8221; and considers all blacks to be basically innocent and abused.  The culprits are victims of society.  Victims  of  &#8220;lingering racism&#8221; (or &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; or  &#8220;systemic racism&#8221;).  And, whatever the case, white society is, at bottom, the  real culprit.  That&rsquo;s the orthodox marxist point of view that all those lawyers and social workers and judges have been indoctrinated with in college.  </p>
<p>When  (all) whites are automatically seen as racist oppressors and   (all)  blacks as abused victims, it&rsquo;s very hard for whites to get justice,  even when it&rsquo;s self-defense.</p>

		<p>Latest News:</p>
<p>(1)  Two of the black teenagers that did the lion&rsquo;s share of the beating were charged today in juvenile court with various felonies.  Legally, their cases will have to stay in juv, which is probably a good thing, because if it went to adult court, they could get a jury, and in St. Clair County, Illinois, that means at least three blacks.</p>
<p>https://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/illinoisnews/story/1586F1C3B8DACF3786257635006BC3A8?OpenDocument</p>
<p>However, you can probably discern the answer to your most pressing question:</p>
<p><i>On the issue of a hate crime, [St. Clair County State&rsquo;s Attorney Robert] Haida said: &ldquo;No evidence is present to suggest that the motive for the conduct was the race of the victim. Illinois law requires such evidence in order to support that charge. Illinois law is clear that the fact that a defendant and a victim are of different races is insufficient without more evidence to support a hate crime.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Of course &ldquo;no evidence is present&rdquo; of hate.  That&rsquo;s because Official Belleville couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to spend the five minutes and 12 calories required to gather such evidence.</p>
<p>(2) In other news, Rush Limbaugh and SPLC Pseudo-Intelligence Chief Mark Potok were involved in a contretemps yesterday and today.  In the process, Potok accused Rush (on MSNBC, of course) of actually calling for school bus segregation, when it was sarcastic on Rush&rsquo;s part.  Rush called Potok &ldquo;an embarrassment of a human being,&rdquo; which of course is ten years late and ten billion dollars short.</p>
<p>https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_091809/content/01125112.guest.html</p>
<p>Mark Potok is what he is. But why did Rush Limbaugh have to carry on in a sarcastic manner about the concept of school bus segregation? I can think of at least two white parents in Belleville that think that it would be a good idea, and I bet that a majority of white people that listen to Rush weren&rsquo;t exactly laughing along with their host, either.</p>

<p>WRONG. The smart thing to do would have been to simply stand at the front of the bus, instead of walking to the back where you know the herd of blacks will jump on you. But so many whites are brainwashed into cowardice that they won&rsquo;t use common sense. And they won&rsquo;t fight back. Hence suggestions like not fighting back when a school of street sharks is attacking you. Ok. Lie there and let them beat you. Don&rsquo;t hit back for God&rsquo;s sake. You might hurt one of them.

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Rush Limbaugh and SPLC Pseudo-Intelligence Chief Mark Potok were involved in a contretemps yesterday and today&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh does tend to prattle on and on wasting time defending himself rather than charge ahead and directly challenge jerks like Potok and Wise.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather hear Rush give justification as to why segregated buses, to protect White children, are a good idea  &mdash;   he could start by citing indefensible black crime statistics including the huge number of black-on-White rapes, assaults and murders each year. </p>
<p>Here is Rush&rsquo;s dead-on comment:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Isn&rsquo;t it amazing? You have black kids who beat up a white kid on a school bus. That&rsquo;s not racism. You have half the country criticizing a socialist health care plan, and that is racism.  Okay, so you there heard this despicable embarrassment of a human being, Mark Potok, from the Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s Intelligence Project&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This comment is, however, a start in the right direction for Rush with his huge national audience. </p>

<p>I can agree with you.  I never suggested he should go back and sit down in the middle of them!  Where did you read that?  The smartest thing would have been to avoid them just as much as possible. Sitting in the midst of them was not a wise thing to do.</p>

		<p>I completely understand those posters who&rsquo;ve said that fighting back would&rsquo;ve been foolhardy, or needlessly dangerous. </p>
<p>To a certain extent I agree. I&rsquo;m not even a parent and it would hurt me to see that boy injured in a fight. </p>
<p>However, in almost 13 years of police work I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s the citizens who make no effort to defend themselves at all that suffer the worst injury. It isn&rsquo;t just about machismo.</p>
<p>Blacks tend to be thrill-seeking opportunists, but they have an innate &#8220;injury sensor&#8221; that warns them off from encounters where the intended victim may prove dangerous. </p>
<p>Be honest with yourselves&hellip;white victims of black violence tend to fit a certain mould: pleasant, well-mannered, likable, easy-going citizens of average or slightly below-average height and build. </p>
<p>How often do we see a muscular middleweight getting victimized? Why are so many victims of black-on-white crime female? </p>
<p>When the victim absorbs one blow, then another, and then another&hellip;blacks are emboldened by the apparent lack of danger and swarm like frenzied vultures. Their &#8220;injury sensor&#8221; cuts off and they swarm like frenzied rats. </p>

		<p>The art of self-defense is an excellent thing to know.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t know it (as this boy clearly didn&rsquo;t) then you mustn&rsquo;t bite off more than you can chew.   Taking on a dozen blacks would be more than he could chew. (But he should have avoided them in the first place.)</p>
<p>Also, as some have pointed out, he would be suspended and disciplined for fighting too, along with them.  Maybe arrested for a hate crime, which they wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>John Lott writes about exactly this in &#8216;More Guns Less Crime&rsquo;   &mdash;  he never mentions race, of course, but in his studies I am sure he is well aware of the disproportionate numbers of black-on-White rapes and assaults.</p>
<p>In interviewing jailed criminals Lott reports that they are far less likely to attack someone who just might defend himself with deadly force  &mdash;  homes where the owners are likely to be armed, areas where CCW laws are in effect, Asian markets whose un-PC, heavily-armed owners well know how they are targeted for robbery and murder, especially should a riot break out.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Be honest with yourselves&hellip;white victims of black violence tend to fit a certain mould: pleasant, well-mannered, likable, easy-going citizens of average or slightly below-average height and build &hellip;.Why are so many victims of black-on-white crime female?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Because they can defend themselves no other way except with deadly force  &mdash;  and blacks know it.  Females must learn how to use guns and not be afraid to USE them when necessary.</p>
<p>For the younger set, as others have posted, martial arts is a great way to learn personal self defense.  My youngest son has been in martial arts since the age of four.  </p>
<p>He told me recently he was cornered by some hispanics when he was in 6th grade in the PE locker room with no adults present.  When one got close enough, he side-kicked the kid as hard as he could directly in the groin.  He said the kick knocked the little thug to the ground where he immediately crumpled and began to cry  &mdash;  the others, like cockroaches, fled.  My son was terrified that he would be in an ocean of trouble at school and that&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t tell me for years.  He said no one ever bothered him after that.</p>
<p>Every penny I spent on those classes and the uniforms, belts and other equipment was well worth it.  Son now prefers to work out at the gun range.</p>
<p>With the current economic turmoil, large, growing numbers of unemployed, and an anti-White, open borders administration it is no wonder that gun stores are being cleaned out and ammunition is getting harder to find.</p>
<p>What might people be so afraid of?</p>

		<p>Latest news:  An Assistant State&rsquo;s Attorney alleges that one of the assailants flashed gang signs after his role in the beating.  Now, as the Church Lady on SNL might say, isn&rsquo;t that special   &mdash;   They can spend the time and money to find out that one of them flashed gang signs, but can&rsquo;t spend the time and money to find evidence of racial enmity enough to bring hate crimes riders.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;m about to say is true, but if they could find evidence for hate, then the whole affair could be bumped out of juv and into adult, or if not that be grounds for (or be bargaining chips for) keeping the assailants in juvenile custody for as long as possible, i.e. to the age of 21.</p>

Remember the White guy named Nick something in New York who fought off the thugs who stole his car. I think he got a 20 year sentence for hate crime. And of course the ADL ACLU $PLC NYTIMES were responsible for pushing the district attorney to file charges of hate crime for trying to recover his stolen car.</p>
<p>Get your kids out of public school if you can. Send them to relatives, anything to keep them away from the blacks who assault, rape and beat them with impunity. Our people are helots and the blacks predators are the spartan youths who kept the helots in line.</p>

		<p>Quiet Professional makes a very good point, it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve noticed too.Although many posters here love to point out a supposed deficiency in black IQ, I have noticed that in geeral blacks have very, very good instincts (and in the elemental jungle to which the politicians have consigned the western world), thse instincts are of paramount importance.<br>
 Sorry but &#8216;Raven&rsquo;s progressive matrice&rsquo;, spectacles and a hypertrophied head count for nothing when your cornered with a knife against your throat (why, your just meat-on-the-hoof, you know just like atavistic Congo tribesmen see &#8216;long-pig&rsquo; as the bush Big-Mac).<br>
 The fact is blacks no who to attack and who not to attack.They no who to whine &#8216;victimhood&rsquo; to and who no to whine to.They know instinctively which white-trash politician to culivate, use and get their way with, and which to avoid.<br>
 - and look folks, they&rsquo;ve won!!! - the whole of the USA dances to any tune they play.<br>
 Ask yourself &#8220;Who&rsquo;s the jerk?&#8221;, and it&rsquo;s not the blacks.</p>

		<p>Two students expelled in school bus attack</p>
<p>https://bit.ly/OYe6</p>
<p>&hellip; for the rest of this year and all of next.</p>
<p>I dont know if it has been noted here, but the white victim was 17-years old and the black perps were 14 and 15.  This brings to mind two points:<br>
1)  The traditions of upper-classmen having authority over junior-classmen and priority for things such as seating has gone by the boards.  Obliterated by school-desegration (how could there be cross-racial authority of *any* kind) plus the egalitarian movements of the 60s.  <br>
2)  The mismatch in age reflects my experience that blacks are stronger-younger and more-aggressive younger than whites.  So if you think your kids will be &#8220;okay&#8221; playing with black kids as long as they&rsquo;re a few years younger, think again.</p>

		<p>Sly:  That begs the obvious question.  Why was there a permanent expulsion for something we&rsquo;re told was just a simple dispute over a seat on the bus?   That the Belleville Board&rsquo;s punishment was so hard implies to me that they think (or they know) that it was more than a fight, that there were seriously aggravating circumstances.  Like racial enmity.</p>

<p>Ever tried to fight off 5 black thugs 4 inches taller and 40 pounds bigger than you?  Ever tried to fight them when 2 are behind and 1 on each side?  Ever dealt with a politically correct school principal under strict orders to let the blacks do what they want to the Whites?</p>
<p>Ever been in juvenile hall with 30 blacks and 1 white with an entire affirmative action black staff running the place and black affirmative action probation officers deciding your fate?</p>
<p>Awakened, it is pretty obvious you have never been attacked by blacks.  Whites are never, never attacked by just 1 black.  It is always at least 3 and often more.  It is never just a random spur of the moment attack either.  Usually the blacks plan to attack Whites and organize the attack very well. And if you plan on fighting back, I suggest you put $5,000 in a sabings account to use for your legal fees.  It will cost you more than $5,000 eventually, but $5,000 is a good retainer to carry things for a while.</p>

		<p>My kids go to a school and my son has seen a group of black kids punching a white kid that was minding his own business, and then they approached my son who was minding his business and were telling him to call them N  &mdash;  -ER&rsquo;s.  He told them no, but they were trying to get him to say it so they had a reason to beat him up.  A black kid my son knew from grade school saw what was going on and told them to back off.  The majority of the black kids in the school have a real attitude.  They are loud and obnoxious in the hall, disrespectful to teachers and will throw the race card at teachers and kids constantly. My kids grew up with black kids in their grade schools and had black friends, but by the end of high school, they have a different attitude about blacks from what they have experienced in high school.  I&rsquo;m not sure when the black kids and parents will figure this out, but the prejudice will always be there until there is a change in the behavior and attitude of the majority of the black students.</p>
