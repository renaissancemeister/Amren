<h1>Muslim Tensions Run High After Ramadan Raid by Police</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Australian (Sydney), September 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>COMMUNITY tensions are running high in the western Sydney suburb of Auburn after police from the Middle Eastern organised crime squad raided four houses during the Muslim festival of Ramadan.</p>
<p>The raids on Tuesday evening prompted a gathering of about 150 mostly Middle Eastern youths and then the arrival of about 100 police.</p>
<p>Police have denied their timing was culturally insensitive and labelled angry mobs who threatened police during the raids as &#8220;cowardly&#8221;.</p>
<p>Auburn mayor Irene Simms yesterday said she did not know the ethnicity of those arrested by police, but said locals were sick of a trouble-making minority dragging down the suburb&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>She said protests about the interruptions of religious rituals were &#8220;no excuse&#8221; in the face of criminal allegations, adding that immigrants to Australia caught breaking their citizenship oath by committing crimes should be kicked out of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the police did an exceptional job in this situation,&#8221; Ms Simms said. &#8220;No religion condones breaking the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detectives from the Middle Eastern organised crime squad seized a hand gun, stun guns, cannabis, ecstasy, pills, a large sum of cash and ammunition from three residences in Cumberland Road and one home in Normanby Street, in Auburn, at about 6pm on Tuesday. This is the time Muslims observing Ramadan break their daily fast.</p>
<p>As news of the raids spread, an angry crowd of up to 150 people gathered on Cumberland Rd, prompting detectives to call in the riot squad, the dog squad and Polair.</p>
<p>Police said the crowd was dispersed after a standoff and three people were arrested.</p>
<p>A heavily-tattooed Lebanese local, who asked to remain anonymous because his police record was &#8220;as long as the street&#8221;, said police in Auburn were racist and should have had the courtesy not to interrupt</p>
<p>the breaking of a fast during Ramadan.</p>
<p>&#8220;They target the same families, they don&rsquo;t care if your mum&rsquo;s in the shower, they&rsquo;ve got no respect,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Detective Chief Superintendent Ken McKay made no apology for the raids, saying search warrants were executed in response to a shooting incident on the weekend. The man injured in the shooting had refused to co-operate with police in their investigations, but Superintendent McKay said police had &#8220;a very good idea of what occurred and why&#8221;.</p>
<p>Police allege a police officer was punched in the face during the raids by a 25-year-old man, who was yesterday granted bail after being charged with one count of wounding an officer and two counts of assaulting police.</p>
<p>A 17-year-old boy arrested in the raids, also charged with assault, was granted bail to appear in Parramatta Children&rsquo;s Court on September 29.</p>
<p>A woman was also arrested and is expected to face charges in the future.<br>

With all the muslim countries with muslims majorities run under muslim laws, it&rsquo;s curious as to why muslims would want to reside in non-muslim nations.</p>

		<p>Islamic immigration is BAD. Period. End of story. They should not be in any western country. Or even any non-Islamic country. They don&rsquo;t fit, they don&rsquo;t belong.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Auburn mayor Irene Simms yesterday said she did not know the ethnicity of those arrested by police&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone in Sydney knows the &#8216;ethnicity&rsquo; of those arrested. </p>
<p>And police have &#8216;no respect&rsquo; because Lebanese thugs don&rsquo;t show respect for our laws. </p>
<p>The police are accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo; etc, the usual nonsense, but Inspector Ken McKay stated:</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&rsquo;t be dictated to - they know well and truly that we&rsquo;re not interested in any issues of race, religion or the like. We are there to do our job and do our job we will and we won&rsquo;t be scared off by people of such ilk&#8221;</p>
<p>The Middle Eastern Crime squad was created for a good reason - to combate the amount of crime committed by members of this community, who are overrrepresented in goals and on welfare.</p>
<p>The police should have arrested all of them. </p>

<p>Sir, the answer is very simple.  The muslims are at war with us and it is their intent to take over, by simply occupying in larger and larger numbers until they are able to have voting majority.</p>

		<p>sbuffalonative- I don&rsquo;t know if that comment was made with sarcasm or not but the Muslims are going to places where the welfare flows like water, which in their countries, it does not.<br>
They are flooding the welfare states then are taking them over by force. I just wonder what&rsquo;s going to happen when they cleanse these countries of their taxpaying natives like they seem so intent on doing. Where do they the welfare is going to come from then, huh?</p>

		<p>Well 3 cheers for the Mayor. But, I disagree, Islam does condone breaking the law ..including murder and theft and assault and genocide. <br>
I have arrested women in the shower (serving an arrest warrant how was I suppose to know her hygiene shedule?)But, one can still be respectful and allow her to dress privately..for the record she was white and she had a horrible crime of not having tags for her dogs. <br>
I can&rsquo;t believe the perp was released in a few hours after punching a cop in the face&hellip;he should have not been released by the hospital yet.</p>

		<p>I watched Bill O&rsquo;Reilly interview an author last night concerning the man&rsquo;s upcoming book on 9/11 and Muslim extremism. </p>
<p>The author said (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing): If Islam is such a religion of peace, when will Muslims start being peaceful?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. </p>

		<p>The police will be forced to grovel and beg for forgiveness. Stopping crime is no longer the priority. Giving a privileged minority a free pass to commit crime is no longer a problem.</p>

Yes, it was a rhetorical question. I ask it a lot when people talk about muslim &#8216;discrimination&rsquo;. Gee, don&rsquo;t like &#8216;discrimination&rsquo;, live in any muslim nation.</p>
<p>I do most strongly agree with anon: <i>&#8220;The muslims are at war with us and it is their intent to take over, by simply occupying in larger and larger numbers until they are able to have voting majority.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Yes, they are flooding our nation so they can transform us from within using our own western ideas of tolerance and fairness. As Mr. Taylor said, the problem is not that white people are bad, the problem is white people are too nice.</p>
<p>In the future, we&rsquo;re going to be blaming ourselves for not being tolerant enough as we&rsquo;re being led to the guillotine to have our heads chopped off.<br>

		<p>The boy who was arrested hit a police officer who was beating his mother across the legs with a club. The mother is a New Zealander married to a muslim. Ask the real questions, and you&rsquo;ll see, a different story emerges. She refused police entry because they did not produce a search warrant. They took  her down, and beat her across the legs. Her son saw this and started fighting off the police officer. News needs to tell all the story.</p>

		<p>These appalling Muslim Lebanese - check htem out on YouTube by looking for Lebanese Gangs in Australia - were welcomed out of heartfelt pity from the time of the outbreak of the 1975 war and the poor Aussies - having learned nothing at all - are now welcoming Somalis and Sudanese.</p>
<p>Australia is another First World country committing ethno-cultural suicide.</p>
<p>Only Japan, Korea and Iceland - so far - are not.</p>
