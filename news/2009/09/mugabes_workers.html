<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Misheck  &mdash;  whose real name cannot be disclosed for fear of reprisals  &mdash;  grew up on one of the farms on Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s estate and his two children were born and are schooled there. </p>
<p>&#8220;The farm managers are cruel. The new one doesn&rsquo;t let us go into the fields after the combines have been in to pick what&rsquo;s left, wheat seeds, potatoes, sweet potatoes,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>&#8220;The previous farmers gave continuity and used the farm properly, and we got bonuses after a good harvest. He also listened to our personal problems. Getting a loan now is a thing of the past,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>After the farms were invaded, he said, &#8220;they stopped workers from doing anything on the farm if they were suspected of loyalty to the previous owner, or connected to MDC. They would harass and beat people.&#8221; </p>
<p>Later rumours circulated that the farms had been taken for the president. </p>
<p>&#8220;First we were told we would be working for ARDA, then later we were told the farms belong to the president. Some were told by [agriculture minister] Joseph [Made], some were told by management. </p>
<p>&#8220;Some who had been working for ARDA were upset because by moving to Gushungo, [Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s company] they would lose their pensions.&#8221; Workers say they are paid minimum wage for the jobs they carry out, which ranges from £13 to £25 a month. They receive enough maize meal for their families and recently were also given vegetables, and have free accommodation. Some of the workers&rsquo; villages have electricity, while others do not. </p>

		<p>Ironically, I was just on another website where African Americans started a long thread boasting of how Mugabe has vowed to grab every last farm owned by whites in Zimbabwe. Blacks in America are delighted over this, and are saying Whites have no business in Africa, and are still deluding themselves enough to believe that Mugabe will ultimately be the savior of Zimbabwe, and that black Zimbabweans will soon enjoy living in a prosperous and successful all black nation. Many of these black posters also happen to live in the UK, and clearly have no sense of irony, to understand how hypocritical they sound posting in a White European country, that they, or their parents immigrated to, all the while insisting Africa should only be for black people. It&rsquo;s easy for them to bury their heads in the sand, and pretend that all will be fine in Zimbabwe once every last white person is gone, since they are living in comfortable western countries with an abundance of food. Zimbabweans however, can no longer afford to be so arrogant and cocky.</p>

		<p>Be careful what you wish for! La Raza, with their dreams of reconquista, might take a lesson from this example. </p>
<p>BTW, Notice how race is carefully omitted from the story. &#8220;Previous Owner&#8221; is an interesting euphemism, very effective at removing any context or meaning from the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previous Owners&#8221;? I wonder why they gave up their farms? I guess they must of just retired and moved to Florida. I mean, surely the article would have mentioned it if the circumstances of the Previous Owners departure were more dramatic than simply retiring to enjoy their golden years.    </p>

28 September 2009<br>
Harare  &mdash; </p>
<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s President Robert Mugabe has built a secret, personal farming empire from at least five farms where the white owners were forced out during the evictions of 4000 commercial farmers. <br>
This is the first indication of how Mugabe benefited personally from the land seizures he ordered in 2000 that destroyed Zimbabwe&rsquo;s commercial agriculture, the bedrock of the economy. <br>
The country, now living with a power-sharing government between Mugabe and his arch-rival Morgan Tsvangirai, desperately needs to rebuild its shattered economy. But Mugabe&rsquo;s private farming empire is an obstacle to the unity government and resurrection of agriculture, according to experts, because an audit of land ownership as part of structural reforms would expose the president&rsquo;s controversial control of about 3 000ha. Many believe Mugabe&rsquo;s seizure of these farms is the primary reason he is stalling on the land audit the EU says it will fund. <br>
   Mugabe&rsquo;s private empire is in what used to be a district of intensive farming, Darwendale, about 48km north of Harare. It began in 2000 with the normal commercial purchase of Highfield farm, a 495ha property near the communal area, Zvimba where Mugabe was born. About the same time, land seizures began all over Zimbabwe, when veterans of the liberation struggle began invading white-owned properties and forcing their owners to leave, often violently. A parallel official process was then launched by the government to take ownership of white-owned land.<br>
Highfield has since been amalgamated with five other neighbouring properties. On several visits to the estate by Weekend Argus, it was clear that the six farms were now operating as a single business. Workers all said they were employed either by Mugabe or &#8220;Gushungo&#8221;, his family name. Guards from Gushungo Security and members of the police are at strategic points around the estate. On June 27 the Zanu-PF-controlled Herald newspaper referred to Highfield as &#8220;the president&rsquo;s farm&#8221;. But there has been no mention of the neighbouring land.  According to staff, the farms were initially taken over by the government&rsquo;s Agricultural Rural Development Authority, Arda, which poured in tens of millions of rands of Zimbabwean taxpayers&rsquo; money under the direction of Joseph Made, the agriculture minister.  A small group of war veterans also occupied some of the land, but during 2006, workers say Arda&rsquo;s role was reduced, while the war veterans say they were asked to make way for Mugabe and were happy to move to another white-owned farm nearby. <br>
   The total estate, with unlimited water for irrigation, spreads around part of a government dam, Lake Robertson, more commonly known as Darwendale Dam, including homesteads, managers&rsquo; cottages, workers&rsquo; houses, huge barns, sheds, workshops, tractors, fencing and other equipment taken from the former owners, plus 19 almost-new centre pivots (overhead irrigation machines that move in a circular fashion) costing about R1.3 million each. &#8220;This is part of Zanu-PF&rsquo;s rapid accumulation of property since 2000, and explains in particular the deep relationship between Zanu-PF&rsquo;s unwillingness to accede to a free and fair election, and its increasing control of the land,&#8221; he said. Mugabe argued in 2003, as part of his justification for seizing farms that no one should have more than one farm. Trevor Gifford, past president of the Commercial Farmers&rsquo; Union, said that since the properties were originally six different title deeds, Mugabe was &#8220;breaking his own rules&#8221;.<br>
&#8220;None of the owners of the five farms have been paid any compensation for them, which they should be, according to the law,&#8221; he said. Weekend Argus has asked Mugabe whether he has licences for occupation of the other farms, but has not received a response. Since there is no official register of occupiers of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s formerly white-owned rural land, the exact structure of the estate remains unclear. Three private limited companies matching the estate name are listed at Zimbabwe&rsquo;s company&rsquo;s registry as Gushungo Investments 364/06, Gushungo Enterprises 1021/06 and Gushungo Construction 19009/06, all of them formed in 2006. Their activities are unknown, however, because contrary to Zimbabwean law, the relevant documents, including their annual reports and lists of shareholders and directors, are not available to the public. Staff at the registry said they could not give any information about the files. &#8220;You know where they would be kept, not here,&#8221; said one official.</p>

		<p>These lamentations sound eerily reminiscent of the same sentiments widely expressed by freed black slaves after the Civil War.</p>
<p>Many preferred the security and treatment afforded them by their erstwhile masters to freedom and the uncertainties it brought with it.</p>
<p>By any measure, the practice of slavery is an abomination.  But the experience of black Africans, trying to maintain an organized, sophisticated, and advanced society created by whites, has been uniformly disheartening throughout the world.</p>

		<p>sorry, about no cap&rsquo;s or certain punctuation d/t broken keyboard.</p>
<p>i predicted this would happen when this insane white farm takeover and squatting first started close to ten years ago. i remember having just gotten by computer and learning of this massive genocide&hellip;as many of the white farm owners were butchered as well. i remember talking about it to anyone who would listen. talking to everyone and in absolute wonder why the international press was all but ignoring this oppression and mass genocide of whites by blacks. even more outrageous was that it was sanctioned and ordered by the government. why, i thought was no one coming to the aide of these poor outnumbered productive white farmers. i was naive of the myths i&rsquo;d been told of the &#8221;liberal media&#8221;. <br>
just as sure as the sunset in the west, the economy predictably collapsed shortly after the forced massive white exodus. i remember a few years later how the zimbabweans - the blacks new name for former british rhodesia, africa&rsquo;s former &#8221;breadbasket&#8221;- after butchering the farms&rsquo; livestock and eating the seed corn for food were continuing their butchering into the country&rsquo;s national parks and butchering the wildlife there on these preserves for food. without a sane white government anymore, who&rsquo;s to stop the slaughter and insanity.<br>
now with all the whites gone, the country wants them back. seems they were more humane. <br>
well, unfortunately for zimbabwe&rsquo;s black butchers and squatters, they apparently never heard the story and learned the lesson of the goose that laid the golden egg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure we couldn&rsquo;t vote, but at least we had jobs and food.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In the late 1950s, the MacMillian-Conservative campaign for reelection came up with a slogan- &#8220;You Never Had It So Good.&#8221;  And that is the case with Rhodesia/Zimbabwe and the Ian Smith era.  Zimbabweans never had it so good.  The Ian Smith times were a paradise compared to the Mugabe years.</p>

The decision to buy milk from Gushungo Dairy Estate, a formerly white-owned farm taken over by Grace Mugabe, the wife of President Robert Mugabe.<br>
&ldquo;In early 2009, Nestle was forced to purchase milk on the open market from a wide variety of suppliers on a non-contractual basis,&rdquo; spokesperson Ravi Pillay said in a statement.<br>
&ldquo;This includes milk from the Gushungo Dairy Estate, which today accounts for between 10 and 15 percent of Nestle&rsquo;s local milk supply,&rdquo; he said.<br>
The company said it had witnessed the collapse of the country&rsquo;s dairy industry in the past few years.<br>
By the end of last year, it found itself operating in a market where eight of 16 contractual suppliers had gone out of business.</p>
<p>Could you imagine the cries of racism &amp; oppression if a white had stolen a farm from a black.</p>
<p>Indeed we should nestle our displeasure.<br>

		<p>Right, the black farm workers were extremely loyal to the previous white owners of the Rhodesian farms. The farm owners did treat their black employees in a fair manner and having a job on one of those industrial level farms was a good deal for the whole family.</p>
<p>NOW, the situation is dire for the farmland and the farm workers. MOST have had to flee for their lives and some murdered. Thought to be in league with the whites and disloyal to the dictator. NO white would have EVER treated their employees in such a manner.</p>
<p>And the knowledge and ability to work these farms as industrial enterprises has been lost for good. A very sad case. VERY SAD! And totally predictable too!</p>
