<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Since 1990, the number of foreign-born people over 65 has grown from 2.7 million to 4.3 million  &mdash;  or about 11 percent of the country&rsquo;s recently arrived immigrants. Their ranks are expected to swell to 16 million by 2050. In California, one in nearly three seniors is now foreign born, according to a 2007 census survey.</p>
<p>Many are aging parents of naturalized American citizens, reuniting with their families. Yet experts say that America&rsquo;s ethnic elderly are among the most isolated people in America. Seventy percent of recent older immigrants speak little or no English. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many who have followed their grown children here have fulfilling lives, but life in this country does not always go according to plan for seniors navigating the new, at times jagged, emotional terrain, which often means living under a child&rsquo;s roof.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t speak English? Deport them. What possible use could they be? This is not your country, grandma. Get out. If your family loves you so much, they will go back to El Salvador, Mexico or Cameroon to honor you and make you comfortable. Because how could you be comfortable in America: It&rsquo;s a White nation with a White culture. Bye bye grannie. Go babble your babble where you came from.</p>

		<p>Boo Hoo&hellip;Why do they need to learn English? They live in their own racial enclaves with their own families who all speak their own language. What a crock this story is. Just think all of them are on SSI/SSA with millions more who will be draining what we worked 40 years to pay into! They didn&rsquo;t work one lick to get their monthly &#8220;paycheck&#8221;, did they? What fools Whites are to be taken in by this misplaced compassion they heap on nonwhites who will drain them of every dime they have!</p>

		<p>Pravinchandra Patel, the 84-year-old founder of the 100 Years Living Club, intervened when he heard that the son in one family was taking his parents&rsquo; monthly Supplemental Security Income check, for $658, then doling out $20 for spending money. <br>

And there is the real story in all this. These people are brought over by their relatives who tell the US government that they won&rsquo;t be a burden to US taxpayers. Of course we all know that is a lie and that this is nothing but another scam perpetrated on working Americans by foreigners and the US government. The US government has allowed massive amounts of third world old people to just plop down in this country never having paid a nickel into the system, but are using Supplemental Security Income (SSI) as a retirement system. And the leftwingers like the ones writing for the NYTimes see absolutely nothing wrong with this scam and mention it only because these peoples relatives are in turn scamming them out if these checks. It&rsquo;s just amazing how these leftwing media outlets can never muster up any outrage about the scams perpetrated on the overburdened US taxpayer by these foreigners. No, their concern is only about how these people might not have full lives in America.</p>

		<p>In the early 1980s a Cuban friend of mine told me that there were many elderly Cubans living in L.A. collecting Social Security who had never worked in the USA, and who had absolutely nothing good to say about the USA.  According to her, they never shut up about how Cuba was superior to the USA in all ways.  The funny thing is, I argued with her about this repeatedly, because I did NOT believe that it was possible to collect Social Security unless you had paid into the system for ten plus years.  But she was right and I was wrong.  I had never heard of &#8220;SSI&#8221; and the government doesn&rsquo;t really talk much about the SSI program.  The government likes to lead workers to believe that Social Security payments are going to people who paid into the system.</p>
<p>By the way, L.A. has huge senior apartment complexes that are nearly 100% Korean or 100% Japanese.  White seniors are not allowed to have all-white senior complexes, but Asians can discriminate somehow, because they are poor little immigrants.</p>

		<p>I see these old people trying to re-create their village ways at Starbucks.  A bunch of guys sitting outside smoking, watching girls, and sipping their coffee veeeeery slowly.  I don&rsquo;t blame them, but they should have stayed home.  I know, let&rsquo;s deport their kids back to the Motherland, and then the old folks will have a place where they belong again.  Heartless, but blame the traitors who brought them all here, not Americans who have lost our place in the world without ever leaving our hometowns.  If they need a little money to re-establish themselves back in the old country, take it from the people who brought them here.  </p>

<p>As I was recently telling a racially aware white female friend of mine, I have begun to suspect that most, if not all, of these non-whites view the white majority tax payers as simply resources to be exploited and taken advantage of by them, almost is though we whites were put on Earth by Mother Nature and we are simply lumped into the other natural resources like water, or edible plants that grow in the wild, and are there for the taking.   </p>
<p>This attitude is never going to change, friends.   Another case in point was an article that I read a few years ago about a huge spike in the population of one of the Southeast Asian refugee or asylum seeking groups in one of the Northwest States, perhaps Montana or Idaho.   The article admitted that 80% of them were on welfare or some other social entitlement programs, and this was causing substantial resentment in the native White population in the area.   As usual, the liberal news reporter who wrote the column was sympathetic to the parasites and concentrated their interviews with the welfare recipients.  I remember one of these interviewees made a comment that &#8216;America doesn&rsquo;t belong to white European people, America belongs to the whole world.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>This is the attitude of almost 100 percent of our non-white population.  So, whether these folks are being allowed to skip American history class, or if they are being allowed to sleep through American history class, it should come as no surprise to anyone in the AR community as to why this attitude is so prevalent in these third world or non-white communities.  </p>
<p>The solution can only be total and complete geographic separation, enforced by strict border controls.  And no exceptions for the white miscegenators out there.  Those people have made their choice, and now they must live with it.</p>

		<p>&#8221; . . one family was taking his parents&rsquo; monthly Supplemental Security Income check, for $658.&#8221;</p>
<p>And where did the government get that $658?  Why they employed a horde of Federal Employees to tax YOU to obtain that money.  Hence, YOU paid not only the $658, but also the salaries of the numerous Federal employees who oversee the collection and transfer of your family&rsquo;s money to foreigners.  You also pay for the buildings and computers and energy and sewage, and metal-detectors in front of those government buildings, and the security guys who man those metal detectors. In order to make sure that some recent immigrant from Mexico receives $658 per month, we have to also pay for all that infrastructure and personnel.  The final cost?  Who knows?  Maybe $200,000 per year from taxpayer money to support that one foreigner.  This does not include all the other social services, such as food stamps, free transportation, free language interpreters, and Medicare, and the vast army of government employees, buildings, and cars to manage those give-away programs of your money.  If granny has AIDS, or cancer the cost to you is in the millions! That $658 is just the tip of the iceberg.  </p>

		<p>I was just talking to a friend of mine about all the welfare cheats we know.  One boy who claims to be bi-polar, only in his thirties, recently got on full disability. He got fatter by the year. Well now he is enrolled in a gym to loose the weight and &#8220;get in shape&#8221;.   We are outraged that WE WORK, yet this guy gets a free ride PLUS amenities!!   </p>

<p>It is virtually impossible for White American seniors to get into any kind of senior housing that accepts any kind of government grant.</p>
<p>Our only source of senior housing for Whites is the private ones that cost $3,000 to $4,000 per month or $200,000 for a condo with $500.00 HOA fees per month.<br>

		<p>According to an article in National Review about 10 years ago, the best selling book in All, ALL asian languages except for Japanese is titled; &#8220;How to get on SSI in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Americans have to put in at least 10 years.  Foreigners who have never put in one dime get as much as Americans who have worked all their lives at low paid jobs.</p>
<p>Many of the elderly are not ancient.  They are in the 45 to 70 year range and work long hours in the family business as well as getting SSI because they are old and disabled.</p>
<p>Just as young adults have fake birth certificates and passports to pass as under 21 for family reunification purposes, so do many asians in their 40s and 50&rsquo;s come to America with fake documentation that they are 10 years older so as to get on the SSI gravy train.</p>
<p>3 SSI elders in the typical asian 20 people in 2 bedrooms brings in around $2,000 per month, a nice addition to the family income.</p>
<p>The church, and immigrant settlement groups are the ones who have set up special channels with the social security administration to expedite the process for these immigrant benefit thieves.</p>

		<p>All of these SSI recipients are also getting Medicaid or Medicare, etc.  Once they have their card, anybody back in the home country who needs an operation can come to America and &#8220;borrow&#8221; the card of someone who is already in the system.</p>
<p>Many of these &#8220;older&#8221; relatives who have immigrated to the USA work for years off the books in their children&rsquo;s small businesses.  They are getting SSI, Hud Housing, Medicaid, and Food Stamps AND they are working off the books at some Chinese restaurant.  I&rsquo;m not sure that I have EVER heard of ANYBODY getting arrested for fraud for participating in these scams.  If the government had any kind of &#8220;fraud squad&#8221; actually investigating/imprisoning/deporting/stripping citizenship, etc., it would have a very desirable chilling effect on this kind of behavior.  But if anytime it becomes obvious that fraud has occurred you let people off the hook with the &#8220;oohh, so solly, no speakee Englee, no can understand papers I sign!&#8221; then the immigrants understandably get the idea that they would be idiots NOT to sign up for Free Money.</p>

<p>How much do you want to bet that the &#8220;owner&#8221; of that building is himself an immigrant and all his tenants are Section 8 housing vouchers so the government is paying an immigrant to get rich in real estate. This is the realy sad part. This guy will probabaly be hailed as an immigrant success story in some publication.</p>
