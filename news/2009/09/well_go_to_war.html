			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Virginia Wheeler and Harry Haydon, Sun (London), September 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SOUTH Africa reacted angrily today to world champion runner Caster Semenya&rsquo;s test results that found she was a hermaphrodite  &mdash;  and threatened a &#8220;third world war&#8221; over the affair.</p>
<p>Gold-medallist Semenya, 18, has both male and female organs, it was claimed yesterday.</p>
<p>And sources close to the International Association of Athletics Federations  &mdash;  who ordered extensive tests on the teen after her amazing 800m win at the World Athletics Championships last month  &mdash;  say the results mean she could still be stripped of her medal.</p>
<p><b>Testosterone</b></p>
<p>Semenya is claimed to have NO womb or ovaries  &mdash;  and has internal testes, the male sexual organs which produce testosterone.</p>
<p>The row over Semenya&rsquo;s biology has caused huge divisions  &mdash;  with South African politicians calling slurs she is a man &#8220;racist and sexist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her birth certificate has the teen listed as female and urine tests showed that, despite her having higher than average male hormone levels, they are within the official limits for a woman.</p>
<p>And today the country&rsquo;s sports minister Makhenkesi Stofile said: &#8220;I think it would be the third world war. We will go to the highest levels in contesting such a decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would be totally unfair and totally unjust.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Jacob Zuma also hit back saying: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know why we should not respect the privilege between the doctor and the patient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, when the tests have been done, why was it published?&#8221;</p>
<p>An IAAF source was quoted yesterday as saying: &#8220;There certainly is evidence now that Semenya is a hermaphrodite.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the trouble is the IAAF now have the whole ANC and the whole of South Africa on their backs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is going to have to be done absolutely by the book, no question of a challenge to our findings.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s all sorts of scans you do. This is why it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past you used to do a gynaecological exam, blood test, chromosome test, whatever.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s why the findings were challenged, because it&rsquo;s not quite so simple.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what they do now is they do everything, and then they can say look, not only has she got this, she&rsquo;s got that and the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem for us is to avoid it being an issue now which is very personal: of the organs being a hermaphrodite, of not being a &#8216;real&rsquo; woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very dramatic.&#8221;</p>
<p>IAAF spokesman Nick Davies was not immediately available to comment on the story.</p>
<p>The organisation confirmed that it had received the test results back and was processing the data.</p>
<p>Semenya was ordered to take tests straight after her 800 metres gold at the World Championships in Berlin.</p>
<p>The athlete received a heroine&rsquo;s welcome when she arrived back home in South Africa following the backlash.</p>
<p>And Semenya&rsquo;s family have slammed the claims, saying: &#8220;It is God who made her look that way but she IS a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>The runner was last week given a make-over by YOU magazine  &mdash;  and called the row over her gender &#8220;a joke&#8221; as she posed in make-up and a dress.</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s athletics chiefs said they stood by her amid the claims.</p>
<p>Athletics South Africa president Leonard Chuene said the organisation would advise the teenager to ignore all media speculation until she had been officially informed of the results of the tests.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We are ignoring these claims. We cannot comment on them as we know nothing about them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will wait for the due process to be followed. The authorities have made a statement to say we will be informed about the results and we await that development.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot get involved in gossip of this sort. Our people will speak to Caster this evening and ensure that she puts these rumours from her mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is at university at the moment. She must concentrate on her studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stand fully behind her as our athlete.&#8221;</p>
<p>Semenya&rsquo;s family also angrily disputed the claims.</p>
<p>The athlete&rsquo;s uncle Lesiba Rammabi, 51, said her relatives were &#8216;very humiliated&rsquo; by the reports.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;I believe Caster is normal, inside and out.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it matter whether she can have babies or not? Many people cannot have children, why else do parents adopt? Are those women not women also?</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a normal family who looked at a child when she was born, saw that she was a girl and raised her as any other family would do. Are we now being told that we are wrong?</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very humiliated by what has been said and do not understand how it can be true.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a woman who was raised a female. She will always be female, no matter what people say.&#8221;</p>

<p>************************************************************</p>
<p>And just what are they going to fight this war with? The recent article about Telkom makes me wonder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so sad how South Africa has deteriorated from probably the most advanced nation on the continent under the English and Afrikaners - even having nuclear weapons at one point - to its current disgraceful state (under &#8220;black majority rule&#8221;) as the rape capital of the world and the latest Third World hole along with Zimbabwe. How do they do it?</p>
<p>If they actually had a civilization worth speaking of, they wouldn&rsquo;t need to have their whole reputation dependent upon the accomplishments of a track star.</p>

		<p>&#8216;And threatened a third world war&#8221;<br>
 Back before I was aware, I used to glean some excitement in my life from checking out third world countries. But Africa was always one step over the line. I used to joke to myself what it would be like to walk into a Zulu uprising with $400 worth of Turquoise jewlery on. Then one night I saw a riot on TV where 1200 African sanitaion workers had armed themselves with sharpened broom sticks and trash can lids as shields. I sat back in my chair and said, &#8220;Good gag, bad plan!!&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>You will, eh?</p>
<p>What are you going to do for pilots?</p>
<p>Remember the ones you trained were hitting their ejector buttons before popping the canopies and winding up opn the ceiling as a black grease spot.  And the others are landing and forgetting to lower their wheels.</p>
<p>Better rethink that declaration of war.  A cardboard box held together with baling wire and chewing gum, with a rifle sticking out of the front for firepower doesn&rsquo;t make for a very competitive battle ship and it doesn&rsquo;t impress anybody but other Africans.</p>

		<p>The South Africans had the test results one month before the competition but refused to disclose them, so the IAAF had to do their own with very little time. Given the results, Semenya wouldn´t have been admitted, so where´s the medal? On the urine samples they obviously cheated. The amazing thing is they thought they could get away with it if only they screamed &#8220;racism!&#8221; loud enough. They do seem to believe Africans can compete only through fraud. Coming soon: Affirmative action in athletics.</p>
<p>- Some half a century ago, there was a similar case in Austria - downhill world champion Erika Schinegger; only nobody thought of cheating then. Indeed, nobody was aware of the problem.<br>
After undergoing corrective surgery, Erik married and raised a normal family. I think Semenya will eventually do the same (with the possible exceptions of &#8220;marry&#8221; and &#8220;normal&#8221;).</p>

<p>I feel bad for her, and it really isn&rsquo;t her fault, but there is no way on earth that she is a woman. If she is allowed to compete it is going to turn international sporting events into a circus of all kinds of transsexuals and hermaphrodites, which nobody wants, (except the Africans of course)</p>

		<p>With a female, that is completely a female, it&rsquo;s easy to tell the gender.  If it&rsquo;s not easy, it&rsquo;s not completely female.  </p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not completely female it should not compete against those that are completely female.  </p>

		<p>Why would you go to war over someone whose profession consists entirely of running around an oval twice?  800m is twice around a standard metric track.</p>
<p>Another reason why s/he decided to compete as a woman, other than the competitive advantage of running against real women, is that it is easier for him/her to cover up his/her hermaphroditism while competing as a women, because women&rsquo;s locker rooms tend to have relatively private changing areas and showers, while men have to change and shower out in the open exposed to every other man.</p>

		<p>Seems those who know the least about science are the ones challenging it the loudest in this instance. But naturally that is par for the course for Africans who did nothing to further the cause of any of the scientific disciplines of the modern world, of which they are not really a part.</p>
<p>What a fuss they make about one athlete. Now to wait and see if they back down on disqualifying him/her due to political correctness. I can see the day coming where somebody with gender identity disorder sues because they can&rsquo;t compete in the gender classification they feel they are a part of. There is no end to the sorts of twisted ways these people think.</p>

		<p>The same rational that separates men from women in sports can be used to separate blacks from whites and Asians.  It should be obvious by now, to anybody with half a brain cell, that blacks excel at certain sports due to their genetics.  So perhaps she should be disqualified from competing against other races because she&rsquo;s black.  At least everybody can agree on that point.  Can&rsquo;t they?</p>

		<p>Track fans were well aware of the controversy before the World Championships. Semenya&rsquo;s head-shaking improvement in terms of performance (in a very short period) had people scrambling to find information. Once pictures alone were available, it was obvious what was going on. Then a blogger pointed out that it was well known in SA that Semenya had been born a hermaphrodite. (Actually, the correct term is &#8220;psuedo-hermaphrodite&#8221;) The blogger posted his facts about Semenya&rsquo;s background weeks before the World Championships. The PC crowd howled and screamed bloody murder, but it turned out he was telling the truth. People should watch the World Championship race itself. The race looks as if 7 women are racing a decent high school boy, and of course the boy is able to run away from the women over the last 100 meters of the race in a manner that no other woman could ever do - unless she had extreme talent plus EPO therapy. (EPO is a drug that increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood)</p>
<p>In a way, the story is very sad, as it&rsquo;s clear that Semenya would have had things corrected one way or another at birth if he/she had been born in a Western Country. No matter what anyone feels about blacks, the situation is not Semenya&rsquo;s fault. But now that SA is enjoying the benefits of black rule, never mind Semenya having been born in a black township anyway, well, what you see is what you get. The same was suspected by more than a few regarding a smaller, but very masculine looking Kenyan woman last year, whom officials &#8220;dolled&#8221; up by giving corn row &#8220;extensions&#8221; etc.(The PC crowd was effective in stifling criticism, much as they attempted with Semenya this time out) But the controversy was nothing like the Semenya mess, because Semenya is so large along with being masculine in appearance - and in mannerisms. </p>

		<p>aj, international sporting events are already circuses full of all sorts of transsexuals and hermaphrodites (and liars, and cheaters, and potheads).  I could care less.  Virtually nobody cares.  Everybody knows that almost every single elite athlete in the world uses, or used to use &#8216;gear&rsquo;?  It&rsquo;s still a big business.</p>
<p>What bothers me it that South Africa feels it can bully its way through this, the same way it is bullying its white population.  And there is a good likelihood that SA will prevail&hellip;.simply because it is irrational and hysterical.  Must all standards of truth and rationality be revised to suit the demands and limitations of blacks?</p>

		<p>Even though I feel sorry for this person I think that (s)he should resign gracefully from the sport of track and field and admit that (s)he did not realise that there was a medical problem. If (s)he had been born in Europe or North America then the problem would have been diagnosed, if not at birth then at puberty when (s)he failed to begin menstruating as normal. They would have probably performed surgery to remove the internal testes and given her female hormones so that (s)he would have a more normal female appearance. However, (s)he would still have the male XY chromosomes. There are other hormone imbalances that can cause a woman to have a high testosterone level, these do not cause an XY chromosome configuration and can be corrected with medication and restore fertility. </p>
<p>It is typical black behavior to become irate about something that is clearly not some arbitrary rule. The extra testosterone would give Semenya an edge that the other women would not have unless they were doping. (S)he does not need to be competing with normal women. </p>

		<p>Did anybody notice the &#8220;6-pack&#8221; abdominals that s/he has on the photo included here?  No woman can produce those.  I don&rsquo;t know why but women simply can&rsquo;t get a 6-pack, regardless of steroids, working out, or anything else.  THIS person has a 6-pack, and as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, that makes her male, not female.  Not only that, but what was that bulge in the crotch about???  Surely not extra socks&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Only in the New South Africa, where they inhale raw sewage to get high, where infants are raped to &#8220;protect&#8221; the rapist against AIDS, and where sex between farm animals and boys is not frowned upon, can a hermaphrodite be defended by its host contry with a threat to go to war.</p>
<p>I think the new SA doesn&rsquo;t give a crock about Semanya; they&rsquo;re upset because their coverup of the fact Semanya is a hermaphrodite is blown wide-open, and with it, a chance for an Olympic Gold medal. Semanya is no more a female, than RuPaul is.</p>
<p>Its family may think Semanya is female, but you can&rsquo;t explain away the fact that it has no ovaries, has internal testes, and has no womb. Plus, its chest is flatter than the South African veldt.</p>

		<p>Plumbing or lack of it determine male for female. It appears she is a female even though she is getting close to being a male. Look at some of the female bodybuilders, they could be a male easy, but are still female. Females have the ability to be very athletic and powerful as some are and some are not. The bigger story here is someone thinking a &#8220;Third World War&#8221; is warranted over a silly sporting event!  Only a black would come to such a silly conclusion.</p>

		<p>I know a girl when I see one.  That is NO girl.  It is too bad she was born half and half but those are the breaks.  Should a woman born legless be allowed to race using a motorized cart?  How about midgets?  Maybe they should be given a 30 second headstart on races because they have short legs!  The insanity of today&rsquo;s world!  And it isn&rsquo;t just this person, or just blacks, it is the whole world.  Here in America if a girl wants to play football she gets to play on the boys team.  That is nuts!  She should be told &#8220;Mary, if you can not find 10 other girls to play, well, you can not be on a team.&#8221;</p>
<p>I really think the only sensible thing is for people to enjoy their children&rsquo;s sports (and their own if they continue play something into adulthood).  So called professional sports is a bunch of hoohey.  We spend way too much time on shemales and other freak show actors.</p>

		<p>&#8220;SOUTH Africa reacted angrily&hellip;&#8221; ?</p>
<p>No, Virginia.  In your state of politically correct confusion you slight your own kind and drag your pseudo-profession of journalism through the dirt.</p>
<p>The angry reaction came from only those members of the black population with an IQ low enough to fall for the socialist mantra in the many forms provided for them.  Unfortunately some - many - find their way into high office, including management of the country&rsquo;s athletics.  They are those that will stoop to any level of deceit to show black accomplishment.</p>
<p>In this instance they have known for four years that this person has stirred up questions and animosity in the athletics field.  Nevertheless they insisted that Semenya be entered to compete in Berlin, and this despite advance efforts on the part of the IAAF to dissuade them from doing so.</p>
<p>It is entirely irrelevant that the name &#8216;Caster Semenya&rsquo; is an anagram of  &#8216;Yes, a secret man&rsquo;.</p>

for if they couldnt have spotted the obvious which should<br>

 Concerning black mentality sports or otherwise I just finished watching the amazing finish to semifinal of US open between<br>
Serena williams and Kim Cleisters..on matchpoint to Cleisters Serena is footfaulted once by Asian linesman and then lets forth a tirade of abuse towards the demure petite Asian looking linesman.After futher abuse where she can audibly heard <br>
to yell ` kill` she argues with the referee and then is disqualified on the point and hence loses the match.<br>
 If you can watch a replay on `you tube` or elsewhere it makes <br>
riveting viewing and gives further confirmation that <br>
black gangsta mentality is not just something that is limited to the ghetto but goes all the way to the top of the black<br>
multimillion dollar heirarchy<br>

		<p>She looks like a bloke and runs like one. Her style is completely different from female runners. </p>
<p>Her male organs are internal and are the source of the testosterone (measured at three times the level of a normal female). She ran only seventh in the world junior championships in Poland last year, but her perfomance improved dramatically this year.</p>
<p>The IAAF was concerned and requested that local authorities examine her. The locals ignored obvious inconsistencies and gave her the all-clear.</p>
<p>Pretty clear-cut. So it&rsquo;s South African authorities who should be called to acount for exposing her to this situation. </p>
<p>Instead of taking responsibility they scream racism and threaten to nuke the West. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be totally unfair and totally unjust.&rdquo;   &mdash;   well, I agree. Totally unfair to the runners who were forced to compete against her.</p>

		<p> Has anyone given a thought as to the racial human spirit of the olympics? The Greeks used them to show perfection in the human form and they served as political points to their enemies that they had the best athletes and thusly the best warriors.<br>
   Todays olympic games were founded in the principle of the best (Natural) athletes from every country on the planet and has always espoused normality in athletes, banning steroids and sexual oddities.  This woman fails to qualify under the natural stance and thus loses her/his medal.<br>
 It&rsquo;s a trdgedy for the athlete but it would be interesting if anyone analysed the goals of the olympics.</p>

<p>These people are probably not well educated, nor bright. They could be in denial. Not to mention Semenya probably had some pscyhological issues as a result of this, even if she believed she was &#8220;female&#8221; she probably felt different, faced ridicule for much of her life because she looks different, and may have clung to that belief that she was 100% female to please family and fit in.</p>

		<p>The solution to this problem is obvious:</p>
<p>1.  Test everybody long before any actual event.<br>
2.  Hold three classes for each event:  (a) One for men.  (b) One for women.  (c) One open to everybody, including folks who are both or neither.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that men would dominate the third category, and the feminists would renew their usual &#8220;sexism&#8221; shrieking.</p>
<p>As an aside, that is not the upper-body muscle-definition of a sprinter in the picture, unless that sprinter happens to be Ben Johnson, who lost his medals because he tested positive for steroids.</p>

So we should avoid any conflict.</p>
<p>Lets get rid of our mestizos and offer any whites living in SA a decent starting package if they move to the U.S.  Then we hit SA with every economic sanction in the books(medicine, food, etc) and threaten to follow suit on anyone else who doesn&rsquo;t follow in our footsteps.</p>

<p>Actually officials are also looking at her coach, a former E. German, who worked closely with the doping programs back in the old E. Bloc days. Some feel that besides her physical advantages, &#8220;ergogenic aids&#8221; were used that help her improve from an &#8220;ok&#8221; female competitor to one of the fastest &#8220;female&#8221; 800 meter runners ever in just a few months. </p>
