<h1>Series of Bias Crimes in Bronx</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Lauinger, New York Daily News, September 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of Hispanic males have shouted anti-Mexican slurs in three bias-related attacks in the same Bronx neighborhood in as many days, police said.</p>
<p>All three assaults occurred in Tremont and were perpetrated by at least four men who are believed to be Dominican, police said.</p>
<p>In each attack, the crew pelted their victims with anti-Mexican invective and then roughed them up  &mdash;  stabbing one victim.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of the exact moment  when I realized &#8220;diversity&#8221; was a lie. I asked a Vegas cabbie to take my handi-capped girlfriend on the drag toward downtown  so she could see the neon instead of  going the fast and easy way on the cross town freeway. My cabbie was annoyed but agreed on one condition. That I understand and acknowledge that &#8220;He was a proud Albanian and not just another smelly Turk!!&#8221;<br>
I did, but the whole ride I found myself wishing for the  good old days when the driver would ask, &#8220;Where to Mac?&#8221; </p>

		<p>     The Hispanic community is not one solid bloc. The various groups don&rsquo;t like each other. The Cubans think they&rsquo;re the best and all other Hispanic groups are lower in status than they are.The lowest on the totem pole, I believe, are the Mexicans. All other groups are somewhere in between. Talk to some Hispanics and you&rsquo;ll see that they are fractured and divided according to country of origin.</p>

		<p>A few years back in NYC there were a spate of attacks on Mexicans by local Puerto Ricans who chanted &#8220;Steal their green cards!&#8221; I kid you not.</p>
<p>When arrested the perps told the cops they liked to call their assaults on chicanos &#8220;Taco-banging&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that evil Whites are to blame.  (probably impersonating the much much more civilized and congenial Dominicans)  Should I have capitalized &#8216;Dominicans&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>The proven certifiable moron, Van Jones, uses his old fashioned propaganda to pretend as if is for all peoiple of color in the US and all of them together are against whites.  That way, ya see, they increase their numbers against whitey.</p>
<p>Only problem with that, bro, is the browns and the bloods are getting real serious in their ongoing race war, and now they&rsquo;re killing each other strictly for reasons of race.</p>
<p>So while brother Jones is giving speeches about what whites have done to all non-whites he&rsquo;s going to be interrupted pretty soon because of all the black/brown clashes around him.</p>
<p>And the other non-whites, brother Jones, don&rsquo;t want any part of the space you are offering under your umbrella of many colors, so it looks like you and your brothers and sisters are going to have to go it alone.</p>
<p>Usually, the phrase, &#8220;Nice try,&#8221; is appropriate for a good effort that failed, but this wasn&rsquo;t a good effort.  It was dumb. </p>

		<p>It is amazing [?] the amount of hate that &#8220;minority&#8221; grops have for one another. Normally, this would be in NYC or Chi Puerto Ricans hating and fighting and attacking Mexicans. But other &#8220;minorities&#8221; also get into the fray. Blacks and Latins especially dislike one another. See themselves as the &#8220;tough guys&#8221; competing for the title and the same turf with gangs.</p>
<p>And how will these crimes be categorized? Whites attacking Mexicans or some such thing? Cited as another example of &#8220;hate&#8221; crimes committed by whitey?</p>

		<p>Since Hispanics (such as these Dominicans) are classified as &#8220;whites&#8221; on crime reports when they are the perpetrators, does that mean that these are just more &#8220;bias crimes&#8221; committed by evil whites against poor abused minorities?</p>

<p>Yes, this  <i>is</i> interesting.  It reveals that in the real world (not the PC world) when the chips are down, race takes precedence over language and culture.  Spanish-speaking or not, Hispanic culture or not, the mulattoes side up with each other against the mestizos, and vice versa&hellip;. i.e. race trumps culture.</p>
<p>Very interesting indeed.  (But any Amren reader already knew that!)</p>

		<p>Voter in #14 is correct that, for score-keeping purposes, attacks  by Dominicans on Mexicans would be counted as White on brown crime but attacks by Whites on Dominicans would transform the Dominicans into browns. </p>
<p>The New York Post and others not only leave out the ethnicity of perpetrators but intentionally mislead readers in this regard. Latinos beating up each other is less newsworthy than Whites beating Latinos. They do this not only because Latino intragroup violence is simply a &#8220;dog bites man&#8221; story, but because of their political agenda.</p>

<p>I remember when Jennifer Lopez first became famous.  A middle class Mexican actually living in Mexico rather than the US with whom I had business dealings asked me if she was Mexican. He was sure that she could not be Mexican because he felt she is so vulgar and unladylike.</p>
<p>He was sooo relieved that she is an American Noo Yawk gal of Puerto Rican descent.</p>

<p>Why would this be unusual, if their races are different? Mexicans tend to be indian/euro hybrids, whereas dominicans tend to be afro/euro hybrids.  The government should do away with the term &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;.  The Roman general Hispanicus would be rolling in his grave if he knew that non-Iberians were being called as such!</p>

		<p>As has been pointed out by others, the attackers will be labeled &#8220;white&#8221; in US Govt crime statistics, and the victims &#8220;hispanic&#8221;. There is no &#8220;hispanic&#8221; category when it comes to naming perps. Hispanic criminals are lumped into the &#8220;white&#8221; category to hide the incredible level of latino crime and to lessen the gap somewhat between white and black levels of crime. There is no doubt this is what our Kommisars are doing when they juggle statistics in such fashion. I grew up in L.A., going to majority hispanic schools, and the Mexicans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans etc all fought with each other. The Mexicans called Nortenos (Mexicans from Northern Mexico) and Surenos (Mexicans from the South) were always trying to beat each other&rsquo;s heads in, besides all the different Mexican gangs fighting each other. The Salvadorans fought with each other depending on what gang they were from, etc. They all fought the blacks, and the few whites were generally lone targets of groups of non-whites. When the days of reckoning come, despite what the Marxists think, the latinos, Asians, blacks, all the rest will not side with Marxist leaders to go after whitey. These privileged groups will be too busy fighting with each other. The non-whites <b>will</b> go after the top dog Marxists, seeing them as whites despite whatever thoughts the Marxists have to the contrary, with their talk of the white race being a social construct. Sure. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re trying to eradicate us. </p>
