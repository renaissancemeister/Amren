			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Seton Motley, Newsbusters.org, Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mark Lloyd is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&rsquo;s Chief Diversity Officer, a.k.a. the Diversity Czar. And he has in a recently discovered bit of archive audio goodness detailed his rather disturbing perspective on race, power and the American system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is of course in addition to Lloyd&rsquo;s rather disturbing perspective on the First Amendment: </p>
<p>&#8220;It should be clear by now that my focus here is not freedom of speech or the press. This freedom is all too often an exaggeration. At the very least, blind references to freedom of speech or the press serve as a distraction from the critical examination of other communications policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;[T]he purpose of free speech is warped to protect global corporations and block rules that would promote democratic governance.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>We have said repeatedly that Lloyd is a man myopically focused on race. What is revealed here is more than just that. Listening to excerpts of his offerings at a May 2005 Conference on Media Reform: Racial Justice reveals a man that finds great fault with our nation&rsquo;s power structure  &mdash;  as he defines and sees it. And in his racially-warped, finite pie worldview, too many white people sit alone in the too few spots atop the heap. They&rsquo;re &#8220;good white people,&#8221; mind you, but:</p>
<p>&#8220;This &hellip;  there&rsquo;s nothing more difficult than this. Because we have really, truly good white people in important positions. And the fact of the matter is that there are a limited number of those positions. And unless we are conscious of the need to have more people of color, gays, other people in those positions we will not change the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re in a position where you have to say who is going to step down so someone else can have power.&#8221;</p>
<p>So white people, good though they may be, must &#8220;step down so&#8221; &#8220;more people of color, gays&#8221; and &#8220;other people&#8221; &#8220;can have power.&#8221; And thereby &#8220;change the problem&#8221; of whites running the show. </p>
<p>So who is &#8220;in a position where you have to say who is going to step down so someone else can have power?&#8221; Why, Lloyd is.</p>
<p>Lloyd now sits astride the FCC, which regulates and oversees a very finite world indeed. That being the radio dial, and the limited number of broadcast licenses that can be issued. </p>
<p>As Lloyd has said repeatedly if not exhaustively in writing, he thinks too few white people hold too many of this finite resource. And he has designed (in his 2006 book Prologue to a Farce [3]) and co-authored (the 2007 Center for American Progress report &#8220;The Structural Imbalance of Political Talk Radio&#8221;) a fee, fine and regulatory nightmare to effect a reduction in the number of the licenses they hold so that they may be redistributed to &#8220;more people of color, gays&#8221; and &#8220;other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how Lloyd wishes to &#8220;change the problem.&#8221; This is his definition of &#8220;media diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>On the tape, Lloyd has an additional gem:</p>
<p>&#8220;The conversation about how we communicate with each other despite being aware of the clear impressions that I know that I make in rooms that I walk into, when people hear my voice, is a challenge. How much do I express the &hellip;  I think really pretty obvious complaints of black Americans in rooms full of whites &hellip; .&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are few things I think more frightening in the American mind than dark skinned black men. Here I am. &#8220;</p>
<p>We told you he was myopically fixated on race. </p>
<p>I can think of a great number of things far more frightening than dark skinned black men. Government censorship  &mdash;  imposed by anyone of any color  &mdash;  leaps to this American mind. </p>
<p>The more we learn of Lloyd and his views, the more clear it becomes he has no business holding any gig at the FCC. He should forthwith join Communist &#8220;Truther&#8221; Van Jones as an ex-Administration official. <br>

		<p>Ha!!! Show me a black man with &#8220;diveristy&#8221; anywhere in his job title that is not myopically focused on race. Unfortunately, this guy has been given the power to limit free speech in America. A black man with a lot of power and a chip on his shoulder. Hey, what could possibly go wrong?</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t so bad.  </p>
<p>The media consists of marxist racist Whites who hate other Whites.  The media has been pandering to blacks for 60 years.  The media supports affirmative action and 800 percent overpresentation of blacks in government jobs.  </p>
<p>The media covers up black on White crime. The media glorifies black criminals as good boys gone bad with entire Sunday supplements devoted to the weekly love story to the  black thug who committed the latest atrocity.</p>
<p> The media created Michael King, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Obama and the rest of the black poverty pimp politicians. The media hates us.  The media even reports Tim Wise and Reverend Wright in a positive way.</p>
<p>The media, along with our government and affirmative action ruling Judges destroyed the average White American.  Many of us have gone so low we can&rsquo;t go much further down.</p>
<p>But these media elites have a lot to lose.  So I say good. Let the blacks do to the media elites what the blacks did to me.</p>
<p>This is what the media wanted, black supremacy. The media, like the neo-con founders of the NAACP thought they would always be able to control the blacks.  Well give anyone such total power as the media has given the blacks and a takeover was inevitable.</p>
<p>I feel about this the way the Chinese refugees from the 1948 takeover who made it out felt about the cultural revolution of 1968 that massacred the &#8220;intellectuals&#8221;.  Since the intellectuals of the 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s supported communism and Mao, it was only poetic justice that Mao turned on his supporters late on.</p>
<p>Think about the French revolution.  The revolutionaries who overthrew the government in 1789 were soon executed by another group that took power in 1793.  They were turn executed by another group in 1795 and 96.   This went on until Napoleon became First Consul around 1799.</p>
<p>Next thing I would like to see the Obama administration do is turn on the Judges who gave the blacks affirmative action, school busing so they could terrorize White teachers and students and gave black criminals impunity.  </p>
<p>Maybe replace White Judges with black Judges the way White government workers were replaced by blacks under affirmative action.  Or the EEOC and the civil rights but not for Whites US commission could pass a law that states that only blacks may become attorneys.  </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s puppet masters have many things planned for his administration.  They have been a long time planning this.  How many White communist girls had babies with black men before the successful Dunham Obama match? How many decades ago did the communists take over academia? It was in the 1930&rsquo;s.  How many decades ago did the communists take over the media?  It was in the 1960&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>The rich marxist liberal elite took over the Democratic party in a very public way the summer of 1968 at the nominating convention in Chicago.  That riot was a violent takeover by rich White marxists of the Democratic party from the working class union members.</p>
<p>Something like this happened to White extremely liberal New York City school teachers in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s.  They had spent decades as good members of the NAACP.  They marched and worked so hard for civil rights for blacks.  They advocated hiring and promotion for blacks in the NYC school system.  Many went to southern segregation states during the summers to work with blacks to end segregation.  What was it called?  Freedom summer?  </p>
<p>Well, those White teachers found themselves bounced out of their jobs when the blacks established neighborhood school councils and took over.</p>
<p>So I say good.  Let this black FCC chief get rid of any many White media leaders as possible.  What goes around comes around.<br>
What the media did to Whites, Mark Lloyd might do to the media.</p>

		<p>The sad thing is those who can be heard such as Rush, Hannity, and others will refuse to talk about why this is happening. Because blacks and hispanics look out for their own race. My bet is they will mention this on their shows but not dare mention how the darkening of this country through immigration will only reenforce this type of anti white behavior.</p>

		<p>As usual, if such comments were traced to a White political appointee his career would be over.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone is cataloging the racist comments and actions by Obama&rsquo;s political bretheren and presents this information (along with examples of administration&rsquo;s general ineptitude) in a concise clinical manner to demonstrate to the voting public why Obama does not deserve a second term come 2012.</p>

<p>&ldquo;[T]he purpose of free speech is warped to protect global corporations and block rules that would promote democratic governance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is very disturbing, even worse than the anti-White rhetoric. The plan seems to be that the First Amendment will be phased out with various &#8216;hate speech&rsquo; legislation and control of the FCC. </p>
<p>If there is a bright side, it might force more of us to resist when the plans are exposed to the public. </p>
<p>And one obvious question: If all these institutions were created by Whites, then why should these institutions be controlled by non-Whites who could not even conceive of them? <br>
When did Africans invent radios? </p>

		<p>In a very real sense I agree with Mr. Lloyd.  Insofar as we&rsquo;re going to make diversity a goal, I&rsquo;m very much in favor of a top-down approach; start with the most powerful positions and work our way down.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;d like to see the top positions in the Federal Reserve go to blacks.  The same goes for the federal government.  And for Hollywood, Madison Avenue, and the media in particular, and corporate America in general.  Academia too.</p>
<p>Let the peddlers of diversity, the white elite, be the first to &#8220;step down,&#8221; starting at the top.</p>
<p>(And when I say &#8220;black,&#8221; I don&rsquo;t mean mulattoes like Obama.  I mean full-blooded blacks).</p>
<p>P.S., I don&rsquo;t buy into the conflation of AA for blacks and AA for white homosexuals and women; there were, no doubt, plenty of homosexuals &#8220;oppressing&#8221; blacks in days gone by, and women benefited from same, so both groups can take a back seat to blacks as far as my scenario is concerned (each group seems a sneaky white power way &#8216;round empowerment of blacks).</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a position where you have to say who is going to step down so someone else can have power.&rdquo; (So decrees Comrade Diversity Czar Lloyd.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, with a focus on some very long term goals mind you, I agree 100% with the FCC Diversity Czar here. Who really cares about what happens to the profiteering media pimps and whores, that this shortsighted fool considers to be &ldquo;truly good white people?&rdquo; I sure don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s squirts for them, and I would find it a savory irony if he forced them out in favor of those &ldquo;of color.&rdquo; How much more damage could they possibly do via the media to this country, than these &ldquo;truly good white people&rdquo; have already done; will they have the audacity to promote a white genocide through idealized miscegenation, or to unfairly characterize political candidates &ldquo;of color&rdquo; as saints and saviors, for example? </p>
<p>After all, who would stand for that, when not even the multicultural traitors have dared to try and do such things, right?</p>
<p>In the end, having those &ldquo;of color&rdquo; and &ldquo;truly good white people&rdquo; destroying each other in a frenzy of sanctimony and greed is a gift from God!</p>
<p>Thus, God let it be so, that our mortal enemies will hoist themselves on their own collective petards!!!</p>

		<p>Before Obama secured the Democrat nomination from Clinton I concluded to my own satisfaction that BHO is in fact a Marxist, with the following arguments.</p>
<p>Barak Hussein Obama, Jr., like Barak Hussein Obama, Sr. is a Marxist!  Sr. was rather open about his totalitarian and collectivist recommendations to the government of Kenya.  Jr. is quite secretive about labeling himself but his plans reveal the man.  Is this suggestion alarmist in the extreme or are there supporting items of evidence?</p>
<p>	BHO, Sr. was clearly a Marxist and although Jr. had little contact with him since he was abandoned, Jr. did research his Fathers history and had &ldquo;Dreams From my Father&rdquo;.<br>
	BHO&rsquo;s mother was a secular humanist, atheist with collectivist leanings.<br>
	BHO&rsquo;s mentor in Hawaii, Frank Marshall Davis, was a lifelong communist and even belonged to the CPUSA.  The two communed at length when BHO was a lad of tender age and most impressionable.<br>
	The politics of the maternal grandparents are less clear but they are the ones who arranged the mentoring by Davis.<br>
	BHO returned to the States for college, Occidental and Columbia, and the slate is practically blank.  For some reason BHO has taken great pains to hide his studies, professors of importance and even acquaintances of these undergraduate years.  Some evidence of drug use, communist acquaintances and favoring of collectivist literature has emerged in &ldquo;Dreams&rdquo;.<br>
	BHO spent 20 years at Trinity Church with J. Wright et al and perhaps more importantly drinking the koolaid of Black Liberation Theology.  Liberation Theology, including BLT, is Marxist ideology that makes blasphemous use of Jesus to attract the uninformed.  BLT should not be considered Christian since it would not even qualify as a Christian cult, as taught by the black bigot James Cone.<br>
	Community organizing is basically rabble rousing the poor and poorly educated to extract favors from the larger community.  His model for community organizing was Saul &lsquo;The Red&rsquo; Alinsky, and indications are he learned rather well.<br>
	BHO had more of a relationship with the Ayers family than he is willing to presently admit.  Bill Ayers, even now, describes himself as anarchist and small c communist (accepts the ideology but doesn&rsquo;t belong to the party).<br>
	BHO in just a few months in the US Senate earned Nation magazine&rsquo;s designation as the most liberal senator, with his VP choice Biden ranked as third most liberal.  That leaves the two of them separated by Bernie Sanders who is a proud Socialist from Vermont.  When you are that far left in the Democrat Party then you are flirting with Marxist ideology continually in your legislative work.<br>
	And BHO did recently tell Ohio&rsquo;s &lsquo;Joe the Plummer&rdquo; that he didn&rsquo;t really want to punish his success but he thought we would all be better off if the government, via BHO, &lsquo;spread the wealth&rsquo;.  The records show that neither BHO nor Biden are interested in sharing their wealth, less than 1% to charity in any tax year, but they want to &lsquo;spread our wealth&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t argue that this is an airtight case that BHO is a Marxist but is significant evidence of his philosophical leanings and frightening that this guy could be POTUS and impose even a fraction of his collectivist ideology on our Representative Republic having a regulated capitalist economy.</p>
<p>The actions of the Obama administration, and especially the dubious characters he has surrounded himself with, support the idea that the Obama administration is Marxist or collectivist in the extreme at the very least.  This character Mark Lloyd is just an example of this dangerous development for the US.<br>

		<p>I think Mark lloyd has a point. I mean look what Blacks in positions of power have done for places like Detroit, Zimbawe and South Africa etc. Where white people have stepped down and given power to Blacks. Oh and why does he mention Gays more than once. I kind of wonder if Mark Lloyd might be on the down low. The other thing he mentioned is that &#8220;Persons of Color,Gays and OTHER PEOPLE should be given what ever he wants to give them. My question is what OTHER PEOPLE is he refering to. Maybe hermaphrodites.</p>

		<p>Wow! Someone high-up in the FCC wants more diversity-friendly radio stations &hellip; like the television media isn&rsquo;t enough &hellip; well no bother, no one will listen to liberal talk shoes. Liberals would rather listen to Rush and complain, or go to NPR for their elitist news and world view.</p>
<p>As for blacks in high places, they can dunk what else do they want? Could you see black people running anything larger than a football team? They have no history of doing such things, and even with white help, it&rsquo;s doubtful they could hold high positions for long. Look how poorly Obama is doing as president?</p>
<p>The FCC needs to leave talk radio alone. There would be a huge backlash among listeners and dvertisers if this man has his way, which he won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So white people, good though they may be, must &ldquo;step down so&rdquo; &ldquo;more people of color, gays&rdquo; and &ldquo;other people&rdquo; &ldquo;can have power.&rdquo; And thereby &ldquo;change the problem&rdquo; of whites running the show.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what ALL blacks are thinking when they lament the fact that blacks (read unqualified) aren&rsquo;t in positions of power and high payng positions. </p>
<p>Are they willing to accept the fact that very few blacks have the ability and intellect to succeed?  If so, are they willing to work within the black community to help raise the educational level and other factors that keep them in menial jobs, instead of falsely blaming whitey for holding them back?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.  They&rsquo;re just like this jerk.  Not much of what he says makes sense and most all of it comes from phrases he has memorized from the book of some leftist radical.  His ideas, writing, and speech are laced with strung together cliches.</p>
<p>This attitude in most all black leaders is one that will continue to keep them on the radical fringe, increasing their hateful rhetoric, encouraging them to speak louder and more harshly against a system that&hellip;&hellip;for the most part&hellip;.. requires qualifications to succeed.  They have a disabling delusion that makes them believe they are failing because of oppression and racism instead of their own lack of abilities.</p>
<p>The white liberals are to blame for much of it, while black arrogance is an important cause also, because both factors refuse to face realism and are playing a gamed called, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s pretend everybody is equal.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, with a black in the White House, it is an especially dangerous attitude, because the president has the power to intensify black delusions and paranoia, especialy if he&hellip;.like the one we have now&hellip;.believes as they do.  And an intensification of delusions and paranoia has been responsible for many wars throughout history.</p>
<p>With the convergence of rising racial tensions along with militant black revolutionaries in the present administration, plus their auxiliaries in the civilian sector, who are being made into civilian armies&hellip;&hellip;.. all added to the declining economic situation&hellip;&hellip; we have in place a recipe for racial war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an exaggeration in the least.  It&rsquo;s a VERY REAL threat, and many experts are saying so in euphemistics terms.  The euphemisms will fall away as the situation continues to deteriorate.  It&rsquo;s beginning right now.</p>
<p>What do your hear now in the alternate media and the public at large, regarding race from whites, that they would never had said pre-Obama?</p>

<p>You mentioned the perpetuating effect of a revolution for revolution&rsquo;s sake, such as the French Revolution, and equated it to white liberals getting their comeuppance.  I think the main reason why the most enthusiastic revolutionaries are the first ones lined up against the wall eventually is because the new regime that gained power knows that a disturber is a disturber is a disturber.  If they overthrew the last regime, they&rsquo;ll overthrow your regime.</p>
<p>This even happened in the United States, to a small extent.  After the successful secession of thirteen British colonies on the North American continent, and the eventual adoption of a Constitution for the new collective of states (not yet thought of as a unitary country until after Adolph Lenin got done in 1865), some of the biggest mouths for rebellion, such as Thomas Paine, were marginalized and left on the outside looking in.  Especially by the Federalist/Hamiltonians, who feared that people like Paine could team up with the anti-Federalists and overthrow the Federalists.</p>

		<p>This is not a black vs White issue.  The attitude expressed by Mark Lloyd is not that of a militant black, but one of a marxist white.  Most blacks can&rsquo;t stand gays and want hispanics to go back home.  They want handouts from and revenge against Whites, not responsibility.  Lloyd is merely a stooge of the white marxists in their war against their White brethren.  </p>

		<p>Blacks are so sensitive to any mention  of race that they have decided that people are racist if they oppose ANY of Obama&rsquo;s policies.<br>
And with that as a backdrop, we have Mark Lloyd, the diversity Czar.  This guy is so racist that you can look up that word in almost any dictionary and you will probably see a picture of Mark Lloyd.<br>
Obama has apparently given  this guy unlimited power to determine who receives broadcast licenses.   And, he gets this power with absolutely no vetting by congress or anyone else with the obvious exception of Obama.<br>
 It&rsquo;s no too  hard to see where he wants to go with his findings that there is a &#8220;Structural Imbalance of Political Talk Radio.&#8221;  Czar Lloyd obviously does not  take  into consideration what the listeners want, he will decide what they get.  <br>
Czar Lloyd&rsquo;s view of the First Amendment speaks volumns:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be clear by now that my focus here is not freedom of speech or the press. This freedom is all too often an exaggeration. At the very least, blind references to freedom of speech or the press serve as a distraction from the critical examination of other communications policies.&#8221;<br>
&ldquo;[T]he purpose of free speech is warped to protect global corporations and block rules that would promote democratic governance.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Yawn, big deal, a &#8220;diversity coordinator&#8221; who hates whites is like an exterminator who hates rats, or a fireman who hates fire.</p>
<p>Their entire job description is to remove as many non-diverse (white) employees from their employment as possible and replace them with as many diverse (black) employees as possible either through legal means or by engaging in illegal acts but disguising them with stealth and subterfuge to appear legal.</p>
<p>With regard to the FCC the thing which irks these left wing would be Stalins more than anything is the total failure to establish any kind of viable liberal talk show type programing on the radio or television in the mold of Rush Limbaugh or Hannity or whatnot. </p>
<p>The Left really thinks that it is really some kind of a conspiracy orchestrated by sinister corporate interests which is why they can&rsquo;t establish any kind of economically viable talk show programing and that it certainly has NOTHING to do with people not wanting to listen to grating, whining, complaining insufferable babble for hours on end.</p>

		<p>Here is a question I would really like to ask: If whites are such a powerful and dominant group, why do we even have to put up with diversity officer&rsquo;s such as Lloyd? If we were really so dominant, society wouldn&rsquo;t constantly be telling us to embrace diversity. Despite the conventional wisdom that diversity enriches society, I have yet to hear one solidly good reason why this is so. If you look at history and current events, diversity of race and ethnicity within a single nation has always caused trouble. I even asked my father, a liberal man who teaches history, to name one society in the history of the world where numerous racial groups lived in harmony and shared power. Of course, he couldn&rsquo;t name a single civilization. He responded by saying that the only reason why such a society has never been created is because it has never been tried. Well, maybe it hasn&rsquo;t been tried because it will never work!</p>

		<p>apologies again for lack of cap&rsquo;s and certain punctuation including question marks d/t a broken keyboard.</p>
<p>i knew mark lloyd guy spelled trouble when he and van jones were appointed at approximately the same time. jones eclipsed lloyd so badly that all the media attention - almost all of it from fox news, as the other stations ignored it - was on jones for his admitted affiliation with communists and admission of having adopted communist philosophy, made controvesial racial statements of an anti-white nature and organization of street groups like &#8221;cop watch&#8221; in oakland which was in many ways like the johnny cochran of n. calif. in oakland, only in a band of followers. this group kept watch on the officers of oakland and the bay area, suing them at every opportuninty preventing them from doing their jobs in black high-crime areas.</p>
<p>now that jones is gone, the attention can be focused on lloyd, which may be equally as anti-american and anti-white. from his praise of hugo chavez and chavez&rsquo; shut-down of government-dissenting radio stations in venezuala to his socialist dictatorship it&rsquo;s logical lloyd is next on the hit list d/t american public outcry. his latest statements of forcing whites out of &#8221;power&#8221; like sean hannity and rush limbaugh could very well force him to have to step down as well. we are not far along in our transition from our individual freedoms and free interprise to state-controlled and dictated government and control.</p>
<p>it may be 75 or 100 years before we see another black president&hellip;if this is the best they - the american blacks - have to offer. the obama presidency may very be the catalyst it takes to awaken the sleeping whites during the campaign that it wasn&rsquo;t such a good idea to elect a black president despite the warnings they recieved from conservative and level-headed white conservatives who pleaded with them not to vote for a black unknown with a radical anti-amercian past with a wife who was equally as radical. </p>
<p>oh my god. we&rsquo;re stuck with this guy for three more years. maybe he won&rsquo;t do enough irreversable damage a good conservative president can&rsquo;t at least partially reverse in 2 terms. <br>
there is hope for america. we can&rsquo;t let one hard left undo what we&rsquo;ve done in over 200 years.</p>

<p>I will never believe obama has the intelligence to understand exactly what it is his handlers are &#8216;prompting&rsquo; him to do (remake the US into a totalitarian, authoritarian state).  They program his teleprompter and he mouths the words, they ghost write his books for him, they plan the strategies that he is ordered to implement.</p>
<p>As 9mmMax points out:  &#8220;&hellip;BHO returned to the States for college, Occidental and Columbia, and the slate is practically blank&hellip;&#8221;   BHOs handlers have taken great pains to hide his test scores, grades and academic records.   You can bet if they were exemplary, this information would have been broadcast 24/7 for the last year in order to show case his superior intellect.</p>
<p>His handlers are indeed following the game plan of Saul &#8216;Red&rsquo; Alinsky, using the poor and poorly educated to attain power  &mdash;  they are but pawns as well, easily expendable, used as a battering ram, given false (but dangerous) powers to destroy any remaining White power and/or wealth.</p>
<p>Here are the opening lines from &#8216;Rules for Radicals&rsquo;: &#8216;What follows is for those who want to change the world from what it is to what they believe it should be. The Prince was written by Machiavelli for the Haves on how to hold power. &#8216;Rules for Radicals&rsquo; is written for the Have-Nots on how to take it away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope it plays out as it did after the French and Chinese revolutions, as it should after the US becomes non-White. The rabble will become increasingly uncontrollable and turn on its hostile elite enablers who will be looked on as just one more White enemy and slated for extinction. </p>
<p>None of them realize how good they have it under White rule. </p>

<p>For a long time the corporate elitists refused to allow anything at all regarding race on their airways.  Having a black like Mark Lloyd talking about eliminating whites and replacing them with blacks allows for a response to what he says, so those kinds of statements act as a kind of entryway for racial responses by whites.  The same is true of Jeremiah Wright, Van Jones (who declares that whites puposely polluted and tried to poison non-whites), and all the other militant anti-whites Obama has appointed.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an immense amount of unjust rage and hatred just beneath the surface of ALL militant blacks, and if they can be prompted to express themselves more we will have a rich source of racist black rhetoric to bring to white America&rsquo;s attention.</p>

White liberals since the 1960&rsquo;s have been pushing an anti-christian, liberal agenda, whereby, over emphasizing race, gender, and sexual orientation as a term of endearment!   Their only aim is place as many marginally talented minorities and women within positions of power, to make up for the &#8220;sins of the past&#8221;, such as slavery and jim crow discrimination. They have founded and heavily fund numerous minority-socialist pressure groups, whose only aim is to put white men out of power! This is a fact, which many white men, in particular are fearful of admitting, publically, lest they be branded a racist. Outside of his name and racial makeup, there&rsquo;s virtually nothing unique, nor fresh about Obama.   He&rsquo;s simply a typical liberal democrat, who will spend the next three and half years, tarnishing the legacy of the presidency, by promoting failed government social programs!</p>

I remember reading, oh thirty years ago or so, about &#8220;Black Rage&#8221;.<br>
These guys are perenially rageful, and much of that emotion stems from pure frustration at their inabiility to think and act their way out of poverty. They are not competitive. They are throw-backs to a much simpler savannah environment in West Africa where you killed your way to success.<br>
I don&rsquo;t worry about them too much. Too much Mau-mauing and the already very powerful internal police forces in this country will take them down. Hell, this guy could be an undercover agitation agent.<br>
As I pointed out to a friend when he worried about the massive immigration rallies of a few years back,they were rather brilliant false-flags ops. They were organized by the FBI and other police/military intel agencies to get the radicals out in the open so they could be photographed and filmed. Why else do you think they went off without a hitch?</p>

		<p>As much as I would like to get worked up over this, I can not. We had eight years of the GOP in the White House with Bush II, not to mention the Republican Revolution of the Reagan-Bush I years. And what did they accomplish on this front? Just about nothing. There was no attempt to build up conservative organizations which might have countered the rising tide of political correctness. Indeed, the GOP seems to be adverse to any kind of militant conservative movement. </p>
<p>I saw this firsthand as an organizer for the Reagan campaign on a liberal campus. Once Reagan sashayed into the White House in &#8216;81, the students who supported him were largely forgotten. As for the Bush clan, it has been beating the drums for globalization and its attendant policies of illegal immigration and outsourcing of American industries. To justify these policies, they need to use the ideologies of multicultism and diversity in order to beat down critics as &#8220;racists&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, Reagan ended the Fairness Doctrine, but what have we gotten in return? The Limbaughs, the Hannitys, and the rest of the motor mouths whose anti-intellectualism is astounding. Despite decades of rightwing talk radio, there has been no challenge to the dominance of PC ideology in America. Why should there be? Limbaugh&rsquo;s main job seems to be putting another country club Republican in the White House.</p>

<p>Given the usual complaints about the &#8220;liberal media&#8221;, what difference does it make who runs the show (literally and figuratively)? At least with Obama, it is all out in the open. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The media created Michael King, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Obama and the rest of the black poverty pimp politicians. The media hates us. The media even reports Tim Wise and Reverend Wright in a positive way.&#8221;    &mdash;    Margaret</p>
<p>Margaret:  For all your oftentimes riveting posts, I marvel that you&rsquo;ve yet to research and discover who the folks are that possess a monopolistic/oligopolistic control of the ENTIRE apparatus of the Western media.  WHY has the media long declared War on the Western/White World?  WHO owns it All?  They hate your guts by virtue of your race and justifiable historical persecutions, and you&rsquo;ve yet to recognize the enemy.  </p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon now&hellip; You are clearly a highly-intelligent woman.  Do your homework.  Our freedom-of-speech was restored by this almighty venue known as the blogosphere for a time before the usual culprits succeed in destroying it completely&hellip; Further your education.</p>
