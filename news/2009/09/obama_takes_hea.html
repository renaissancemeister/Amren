			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Wallsten, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Trying to quell a conservative uproar over his healthcare agenda, President Obama has proposed barring illegal immigrants from a possible government-arranged health insurance marketplace  &mdash;  even if the immigrants pay with their own money.</p>
<p>The move has surprised some of Obama&rsquo;s fellow Democrats and infuriated immigrant advocates, who on Tuesday attacked the position as political pandering and bad policy.</p>
<p>The White House revealed its stance Friday, after a renewed debate over illegal immigration that was triggered when Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) heckled Obama on the issue during the president&rsquo;s televised address to Congress.</p>
<p>Wilson yelled out, &#8220;You lie!&#8221; when Obama said that illegal immigrants would receive no benefit from his healthcare proposals.</p>
<p>But some on the political left say that the White House  &mdash;  wary of more damaging battles with the right  &mdash;  has given in to Wilson and other conservatives.</p>
<p>Wilson &#8220;acted like a buffoon, and everybody criticized him  &mdash;  but then at the end of the day he sort of got his way,&#8221; said Brent A. Wilkes, national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;It rewards bullying in a way that begets more bullying,&#8221; said Frank Sharry, who directs the pro-immigrant group America&rsquo;s Voice and has been advising the White House and congressional Democrats on broader immigration issues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A White House official said that Obama&rsquo;s stance barring undocumented immigrants from participating in the insurance marketplace did not reflect a change of heart after Wilson&rsquo;s outburst  &mdash;  only that the specific question had just come up in recent days.</p>
<p>&#8220;The president has been clear since the campaign that he does not intend for health insurance reform to cover undocumented immigrants,&#8221; said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity while discussing official White House policy.</p>
<p>But several White House allies said Tuesday that the policy was a shift designed to position Obama to the right of his critics.</p>
<p>Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.), an early Obama ally, said Tuesday that members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were reevaluating their support for the healthcare overhaul.</p>
<p>Wilson&rsquo;s outburst, Gutierrez said, was &#8220;said in a mean, ugly way. And what the president did was create an even meaner, uglier public policy to accompany it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigrant advocates said Tuesday that the insurance issue could be a political headache for the White House if members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, after hearing from their constituents, felt pressured to vote against the healthcare legislation.</p>
<p>Some said they intended to organize activists in the coming days to push the White House and Democratic leaders to make the bill more favorable to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s policy statement, some activists said, was motivated by politics  &mdash;  an effort to build credibility with conservatives and defuse criticism that the president was soft on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Experts said Tuesday that the dust-up over immigration amid the broader healthcare fight underscored the political challenges that await the White House later this fall and next year, when Obama has said he hoped to overhaul the immigration system.</p>
<p>Obama has said he supports creating a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. But some say that his new restrictive policy violates the spirit of that old pledge.</p>

		<p>If you think about bullying look what happened to Trent Lot, look what happened to Don Imus, look what happened to Robert Bork and anyone else who has said or done something out of PC fashion. Whites are always put in this position it&rsquo;s about time we bullied back.</p>
<p>By the way Obama directly excluding immigrants in this latest proposal only proves that he was working on the sly to get them coverage. </p>

		<p>Immigration is the perfect wedge issue, which is why the Reds and their lackeys in the MSM have always tried to avoid it.  It is a straightforward win-lose proposition between us and the foreigners, but a lose-lose for the left.  Either they outrage their brown legions, or outrage us.  The Red&rsquo;s position is indefensible, so we need to force them to defend it, the decorum of the House be damned.  Our civility is just a set of handcuffs keeping us from defending ourselves.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanic pressure groups: Joe Wilson wins if illegals aren&rsquo;t covered by medical &ldquo;reform.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The one aspect to all of this that nobody has yet pointed out is that efforts will be made to include a clause in the healthcare bill NOT to include illegals.</p>
<p>Wilson was VERY effective in what he done.  It has brought attention to an issue that would have slipped through the cracks for certain.</p>
<p>Now, I really can&rsquo;t see how they can avoild eliminating illegals without making Obama a liar.</p>
<p>Could it be Wilson knew this and his reaction was preplanned?</p>

		<p>The illegals are already getting free health care in the hospitals  emergency rooms. What difference does it make if they get health insurance or not? At least if we give them health insurance, then maybe we can get them out of the emergency rooms. Either way we are going to pay for the illegals health care as long as they are in this country. I don&rsquo;t hear a lot of talk about deporting them. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s very simple.  Obama will push though amnesty and, ta da, they can be covered because they&rsquo;ll no longer be illegal.</p>

		<p>To Q:<br/>
Could it be Wilson knew this and his reaction was preplanned?</p>
<p>I have watched Wilson in the past on some other issues and I do believe that he is smart enough and capable enough to have thought this chess move through to get what he wanted.<br/>
Kudos to him.<br/>
The problem is, even if the bill says it, it comes down to enforcement, and we all know how well our border is enforced, right?<br/>
It is necessary to have it there, and the fight goes on, but the next move will be for Obama to just get them all amnestied, then the point is moot.<br/>
2042 is our predicted date of defeat.<br/>
We are getting very close (or are at) the point of no return and will be forced into armed insurrection soon. This will result in the Balkanization of this nation.<br/>
I see no way out, we let our problems grow to the unmanageable point, and it is the not the fault of the legions of minorities, it is OUR fault.<br/>
Instead of fighting all of this tooth and nail at every occurrence, we took the easy way out.<br/>
Now, we are going to have to pay for it.</p>

		<p>JOE-  We have been propagandized (is that a word?) for decades by the MSM to be TOLERANT.  White people don&rsquo;t protest.  Who on here always says &#8220;worse is better&#8221;?  YES! CORRECT!  It had to get worse and force whites into a corner and now they are waking up from their TV inspired stupor.   Everyone needs to turn that thing OFF.  We don&rsquo;t control this country and haven&rsquo;t for a very long time.  A shadow government whose objective is the NWO does.  Just do some investigating for yourself and I can suggest a few places to start, and then form your own opinion.</p>

		<p>Crime and corruption are the cornerstones of Hispanic societies in general, Mexican society in particular, and the URL below is but one example of the corrupting influence they have upon our society:</p>
<p>http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2009/09/17/0917dmvlicenses.html</p>
<p>If the Hispanic illegals are given access to our proposed universal healthcare programs their criminality will bankrupt it overnight.  If the Hispanic illegals are given amnesty then pervasive crime and corruption will quickly become institutionalized in every facet of American society&hellip;  </p>

		<p>@8 Joe        You are so right, the same thing happened in Yugoslavia, 40 years of appesement, the albanians bred like rats for all this time and Serbia lost Kosovo with a little help from America.</p>
<p>The only difference is that the Serbs were fighting with guns and would have won while Americans don&rsquo;t have the guts to fight, you even elected a mulatto that hates you as president.</p>
<p>Obama didn&rsquo;t just happened, he is the beggining of the end of America which will never be what once was.</p>
<p>Joe you are right, if you want to see your future, look at former multicultural Yugoslavia.</p>

		<p>To ER:<br/>
Sadly, I must agree.<br/>
When it comes to the course of a nation, there are two things that count: demography and education.<br/>
We never controlled who could enter, then never bothered to force those entering to assimilate.<br/>
We allowed our schools to be taken over by socialists in a coordinated campaign that goes back to the 30&rsquo;s.<br/>
The only way to win back what we have lost is through controlling those two things, which through normal peaceful political means would take too long, be too expensive and in the end, fail as we don&rsquo;t have good enough numbers.</p>
<p>The problem with those that are free is that they do not want to be bogged down with constantly policing their government and schools. It is an irony that the free person that wishes to remain unmolested by his government is the person who gives them the ability to slowly but surely put them against the wall.</p>
<p>It may not happen for 30 years or 50 years, but it would not surprise me if it happened in my lifetime.<br/>
We are on a collision course with the iceberg going full steam ahead, it is dark and foggy, the captain is in his bunk and the watchman is asleep.</p>
