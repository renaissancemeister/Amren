			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicole C. Brambila, Desert Sun (Palm Springs, California), September 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite a sluggish U.S. economy that has seen its highest unemployment rates in 25 years, roughly one in three Mexicans would move here, according to a report released this week.</p>
<p>A poll by Pew Global Attitudes Project surveyed the attitudes of adults living in Mexico.</p>
<p>Those findings, one researcher said, suggest that in comparison, the turmoil in Mexico means the U.S. is still an attractive alternative.</p>
<p>&#8220;That just highlights the problems they&rsquo;re facing in their country,&#8221; said Juliana Menasce Horowitz, a senior researcher with Pew Global Attitudes Project in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly six in 10 Mexicans say those who move to the U.S. enjoy a better life.</p>
<p>A third would move to the U.S. if they had the means and opportunity, even without a visa.</p>
<p>Four in 10 Mexicans say they know someone who left for the U.S. but returned unable to find a job.</p>
<p>Four in 10 Mexicans have friends or relatives living in the U.S. and nearly one in five receive money from relatives in another country.</p>
<p>Nearly half, or 47 percent, know someone who was turned back by U.S. Border Patrol.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of Mexicans are dissatisfied with the direction of their country, describing crime, drugs, political corruption and the economy as very big problems. Roughly 83 percent of Mexicans support President Felipe Calder√≥n&rsquo;s tactic of deploying the army to fight drug traffickers.</p>
<p>Local experts were not surprised by the poll&rsquo;s results.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economy in Mexico is not good, so what are they going back to?&#8221; said Juan Lujan, a Latin America expert and dean of off-campus programs for College of the Desert.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The employment sectors hardest hit  &mdash;  construction and hospitality  &mdash;  typically attract unskilled, undocumented workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the going price to hire a coyote to smuggle someone across the border topping out at roughly $3,000, Lujan said he suspected that the majority of Mexican nationals here will simply hunker down until the economy recovers.</p>
<p>&#8220;For some it&rsquo;s a question of, &#8216;I&rsquo;d like to go back,&rsquo; but the dilemma of coming back across the border keeping them here,&#8221; Lujan said.</p>

		<p>Living in squalor, in cardboard shacks and tin roofs, with raw sewage running down the streets and the water supply contaminated with cholera and other water borne diseases, almost any kind of environment is a plus for these people.</p>
<p>But, I do have to say, if they had not deserted their towns and villages to go to the cities, they were living in a decent but backward environment, something like late 19th Century America.  But the lure of the high life prompted them to relocate to urban areas and the first time their economy took a hit they were destitute and the slums deteriorated even further, until they reached present day conditions.</p>
<p>Unlike early Americans these people don&rsquo;t have the inventiveness, creativity and intellectual ability to turn their towns and villages into a more modern area.</p>
<p>As it stands, the only thing they can do to get a first rate society is to steal one, like they&rsquo;re in the process of doing right here, right now.</p>

		<p>4 ice is right.  The slums the Mexicans create here are their version of the American dream.  What we see as social pathology is upward mobility to them.  </p>

In other words those who want to break into our country and rape it&rsquo;s rewards for themselves are already of a criminal bent, or have no qualms about criminal acts. Why are we letting Mexico&rsquo;s lowest element into our country? Intead of greeting them with scores of costly social programs, greet them with a solid line of defence thatthey cannot penetrate, and the particularly determined ones can be turned back with rifle fire from the border patrol of an America who does NOT want them. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;leaders&#8221; we have had for quite some time now, have turned the United States into the Welfare Nation. Welfare for anyone who arrives here legally, the moment they cross the borders, and every conceivable service to even illegal aliens to the point of bankrupting the social services of American citizens in many States. NOW WHY WOULD THE U.S.NOT STILL BE APPEALING TO MEXICANS?</p>

		<p>Hurray for calling them Mexicans and latinos or hispanics that are are not. </p>
<p>Call them reds or mongoloids too. </p>
<p>Mexicans hate being referred to as Mexican and prefer latino or hispanic because they signify a tie to white Europeans, so dont give them what they want. </p>
<p>If they want to be latinos or hispanics then call them red latinos or red hispanics but Mexican is the best label since they picked it 175 yrs ago and dropped New Spain yet retained all the Euro western culture tongue and religion etc.</p>

		<p>Any successful or advanced nation would consider it an emergency and disaster if, in peacetime, millions of its citizens were flooding across the border to a neighboring nation. The fact that The Land of Undrinkable Water is not only not alarmed by this but is actually encouraging it shows: </p>
<p>1. What Mexico&rsquo;s REAL ulterior motive is in encouraging this massive invasion of a neighboring country and </p>
<p>2. How they can&rsquo;t make a success of their country, even though they benefit from living right next door, and receiving the largess of the world&rsquo;s most successful nation, which reveals the quality of the people who inhabit Mexico. </p>
<p>The fact that we can&rsquo;t even acknowledge this undeniable fact shows how cowardly and corrupt in spirit our own people are.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s great, most of the world probably feels this way about America. But don&rsquo;t come into our country illegally. Our politicians seem to be of the opinion that entering this country illegally and breaking a host of other laws is something less than a parking violation, ( believe me, I know for a fact that a certain senator and congressman from New York feel this way because I have spoke to them).These politicians are our worst enemies, and we need to get them out of office ASAP.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cultural imperialism is the practice of promoting, distinguishing, separating, or artificially injecting the culture of one society into another. It is usually the case that the former belongs to a large, economically or militarily powerful nation and the latter belongs to a smaller, less important one. Cultural imperialism can take the form of an active, formal policy or a general attitude. The term is usually used in a pejorative sense, usually in conjunction with a call to reject foreign influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The signs of Mexican Cultural imperialism can be seen and heard in every community n America.  Mexican Cultural imperialism is aided and abetted by American politicians and businessmen.  <br/>
Mexican Cultural imperialism is an act of war&hellip;<br/>
