			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Annie Sweeney, Kristen Mack, Andrew L. Wang and Kristen Schorsch, Chicago Tribune, Sept. 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three teenagers have been charged with beating to death 16-year-old Derrion Albert, an &#8220;innocent bystander&#8221; who walked into the middle of a street fight between two groups of feuding teens last Thursday, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the fight  &mdash;  with teens punching and kicking and swinging two-by-fours  &mdash;  was related to a shooting outside Fenger earlier that day. </p>
<p>Charged with first-degree murder are Silvonus Shannon, 19, Eugene Riley, 18, and Eric Carson, 16, according to the Cook County state&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s office. All were charged as adults and all were ordered held without bond today.</p>
<p>At the teens&rsquo; bond hearing this afternoon, a Cook County prosecutor said Albert was beaten by teens from both sides of the feud, which simmering rivalry between two groups of Fenger students, one that lived near the school and the other from the Altgeld Gardens housing development.</p>
<p>Police said that an <a href="/videos/20090928derrion_albert/index.html"><big>amateur video</big></a> helped detectives identify the participants in the melee outside the Agape Community Center, 342 W. 111th St. That video was provided to Fox affiliate WFLD-Ch. 32., which turned it over to detectives Friday night. Fox said it paid its typical freelance fee of about $300 for exclusive rights to the video.</p>
<p>The video shows dozens of people punching, kicking and swinging planks in a melee in a lot next to the community center and the adjacent street. At one point, four or five males  &mdash;  including one wielding a two-by-four  &mdash;  can be seen beating and stomping another person, believed to be Albert, who had fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before the announcement of charges, Chicago Police spokesman Roderick Drew said investigators had identified several people from the video and were questioning four of them.</p>

		<p>According to the article on msn.com about this killing, in the school year 2006-7 in Chicago 30 students were killed in school, most by gunfire.  In the 2007-8 school year 20 students were killed, 18 by gunfire.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;innocent bystander&#8221; is anything but. I just watched the video and he tried to punch someone right before being hit with a 2 by 4. Now I&rsquo;m just waiting for whites to somehow be blamed for this.</p>

		<p>Remember the video a few years ago where blacks were having a mob fight at a school stadium during a game, and Jesse tried to intervene so they wouldn&rsquo;t be expelled?  You know to help keep the brouthas in school by passing on any kind of discipline?</p>
<p>Well, there was a black, middle aged, AA gimme professor on O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s program who tried to play it all down by telling O&rsquo;Reilly that boys will be boys and that he should remember when he did the same thing at that age.  When O&rsquo;Reilly replied that in no way did he ever engage in mob attacks on another person or group, the &#8220;oppressed&#8221; AA professor implied he was racist for condemning the black conduct and calling for expulsion.</p>
<p>My point is that blacks don&rsquo;t regard this kind of activity as something that is far outside the norm for civilized people.  This incident reported here occurs quite often. (How about Jena where the thugs who attempted to murder a lone white kid were hailed as heroes?)</p>
<p>Jesse and Al want all black felons to vote.  They want them to go to jail less often, because their numbers far exceed those of whites, even though they commit FAR more crimes.  They want their convicted felons to have ALL their rights restored.</p>
<p>In other words, these incidents and black attitudes are excellent examples as to why black societies are failed societies the world over.</p>
<p>The one blaring obvious fact of this and all the other incidents tells us clearly why blacks have no business living in a civilized society and would be better off reverting back to their villages and huts.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We want to provide reassurance to the public that there&rsquo;s a police presence and they can feel safe in the neighborhood and kids can feel safe at school,&#8221; said Morgan Park District Commander Michael Kuemmeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is such a difficult thing to deal with,&#8221; said CPS head Ron Huberman. &#8220;There are no words that can ever make it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, police presence on school campuses has become all to commonplace and necessary ever since the infamous Brown decision resulted in &#8220;Blacks&#8221; integrating the public schools. Contrary to what District Commander Michael Kuemmeth says, though, few Latino, Asian, and White students feel safe in their neighborhoods and on their police occupied campuses.</p>

		<p>This really goes to show how these idiots think. Supposedly they are there for a fight against a rival gang yet they bash someone to death who has nothing to do with it. If the rival gang didn&rsquo;t turn up I&rsquo;m sure these halfwits would either attack innocent people or simply start fighting amongst themselves.</p>

		<p>Here in Toronto we&rsquo;ve had an increase in violence in our high schools. Last year a dozen or so schools started posting a policeman. This year they exanded the program to include most of the high schools in the city. Back in the seventies when I went to high school it would have been unimaginable that the situation would deteriorate so badly. Discipline was managed by a tough vice-principal back then. There was no gang activity in the schools with a few of the boys drifting toward biker gangs but that had no impact on the schools.</p>

		<p>I hope all Democrats and liberal Republicans join me in demanding a law to ban two-by-fours.<br>
Also, a fortunate coincidence in that this beating occurred in Chicago.  President Obama is about to travel to Denmark to promote the notion of having the 2016 Olympic Games in Chicago.  Obama can now say that if held in Chicago, the Olympics may initiate a new sport, to-by-four killings.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  Hugh Murray</p>

		<p>&#8221; Turn the brothers loose, turn the brothers loose! &#8221; I was struck how much these future NFL Hall of Famers resembled a pack of hyenas fighting a nearby pack over territory. I think a little gun stamp legislation is needed here. Let`s turn Fenger and all other Chicago inner city high schools into &#8221; Carry guns and use them free fire zones.&#8221;<br>
     If these Obamites want to slaughter each other let us all say &#8221; AMEN &#8220;. Passers by should be allowed to cull the packs but only if they have a liscense and adhere to the ten thug a day limit. To save further money and to be eco-friendly their bodies should be re-cycled at Lincoln Park Zoo. We need to let boys be boys.This would be a good use of stimulus funds. Trade in your old clunker 38sp revolver for a new American made Smith or Colt automatic 9 mm with a 15 shot clip.<br>
     Too long have we have wasted money on prisons and jails. It costs about 40,000 a year to lock up a single victim of racism and police brutality. For that amount we could purchase 240 pistols complete with 2 clip fulls of instant &#8221; Rest in Peace.&#8221; The losers in the &#8221; Urban games,&#8221; would become immortal. They can vote for the next thousand years in democratic primaries.<br>

		<p>The savagery of blacks is now known world-wide. There is no place on the planet where they have settled and then became productive and peaceful.  That&rsquo;s, &#8220;no place&#8221;. </p>
<p>Such is quite an indictment of an entire race, I know, but race reality must be addressed sooner or later.  From a collective standpoint, the race is barbaric, tolerant of the worst forms of vulgarity, and they&rsquo;re near adolescent in their sense of personal government to include common civil behavior. They&rsquo;re masochistic as well as they mindlessly follow and obey the likes of a Jesse Jackson and &#8220;slick&#8221; Al Sharpton. Has anyone ever heard these two hucksters say, &#8220;some black people&hellip;.&#8221;?</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t anyone hand me the nonsense that I&rsquo;m wrong lumping all blacks into one group. In all forms of the media, blacks refer to themselves in the collective, especially in politics, and they voted nearly one hundred percent for obama, the halfrican-american. </p>
<p>The racial insanity continues as whites and asians continue to nearly go broke in order to move to areas where blacks are scarce. Blacks, however, will soon follow as they always do to create misery, death, and mayhem.      </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so shocked!  This is outrageous!  This is racism on display.  If the rich white suburbs did not take all the school funds and leave the inner city with so little these bright young kids would be at band practice or at home doing homework.  This is blatant racism!  They, rich white people in media, are trying hard to make Obama look bad  &mdash;  cuz he from the neighborhood.  Black people don&rsquo;t act this way anyway, so people will find it hard to believe.  The police just sat at watched it happen.  Its their fault.  This is more characteristic of asian students anyway.</p>

If a gun had been used, he would have been bleating for for gun control, as would all the Bantus in the neighborhood. But because two-by-fours and other objects were involved, all they can do is mutter something about stopping crime and reaching youth.</p>

		<p>Strict, firm, ruthless justice is required in areas such as these. All those bystanders screaming for help while these criminals fear none of them. I suppose it would be illegal to kick them out of school. I suppose it would be a crime against humanity for anything above rehabilitation to take place for these boys. Something obviously needs to be done about this sort of thing. The handholding and the excuses need to end. We can&rsquo;t afford the jails, the courts are overloaded but nobody can live like this or amongst this. This country should treat those with an absolute indifference to human life with the same indifference. These criminals deserve the same public execution that they themselves have committed. </p>

		<p>Here are excerpts from another Chicago article about the beating.  Basically, it is all Whitey&rsquo;s fault for not having a better police presence around the school.  Demonstrations are planned.  </p>
<p>The blacks are in their standard mode of expecting someone to save them from then selves.  Of course if the police do establish an enhanced presence around the school(day-care for ferals) the political pimp preachers and activists will be demonstrating to lessen the police presence.</p>
<p>This beatdown death is the direct result of all those ACLU ADL AJC NAACP lawsuits that end with Judges forbidding schools to discipline, expell or even attempt to control the anarchy and chaos of the feral blacks.  If the school begins to discipline the ferals, they will soon be in court.  Of course the school administrators in Chicago are mostly black and they just occupy their offices and collect their paychecks.</p>

One local pastor&rsquo;s reaction to the violence is &#8220;outrage.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Earlier at Fenger, a group of riled-up residents attempted to storm the building, shouting and pounding on the school doors. More police were called in and the demonstrators were sent away, but emotions boiled over at times. </p>
<p> Several pastors from different churches gathered outside the school at 11220 S. Wallace St. before the day began to pray for an end to the violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we pray, we have to work those prayers, and we have to get busy in the neighborhood to do all that we can to make sure that our community is safe and our young people, who are our most valued commodity, are safe and protected,&#8221; said Pastor Alvin Love.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the surrounding neighborhood, posters demanding peace were everywhere, put in place by activists from the anti-violence group called the BlackStar Project. </p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;The video games they watch all day long, the surreal TV, you can&rsquo;t do those things that you do on these video games,&#8221; Anthony added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One activist promised that if they sense no progress on dealing with youth violence, he&rsquo;ll organize a demonstration to embarrass the Mayor and the school system.</p>
<p>Mark Carter pledged to take a large group of children right up to the barricades outside President Obama&rsquo;s Kenwood home. It&rsquo;ll be in full view, he says, of the international press. </p>

		<p>The California department of education recently spent millions doing a survey on why high school students drop out.  A major factor cited by black and hispanic students was that school was just too dangerous.  They got tired of being always on edge, always having to fight and just scared to go to the dangerous schools they themselves created.</p>

<p><i>Since all children are born as barbarians they need to be civilized. This usually takes parents and peers to do the teaching by example. These are children of children of children none of whom ever grew up.</i></p>
<p>Then the question is why do some insist that the barbaric uncivilized children be full members in good standing in our society?</p>
<p>Can anyone with an common sense look at that bunch of people involved in such violent activity and think that they should be equally represented as doctors, lawyers, and corporate chiefs?</p>

		<p>the Altgeld Gardens housing development<br>
Location of Obama&rsquo;s first alleged &#8220;success&#8221; as a community organizer. </p>
<p>His biographies go on and on about his success.  Actually the success was some asbestos removal that had been scheduled by the city and HUD about a year before he ever arrived.</p>
<p>Altegeld Gardens is often mentioned as the most successful of Chicago&rsquo;s housing projects.  The success is attributed to the tenant&rsquo;s association, composed of &#8220;strong black matriachs&#8221;  gag gag.  Basically the standard testostorone overdosed agressive bullies that raised the feral thugs who committed this beat down.</p>
<p>Had the victim been White, the news would have been totally suppressed but for the mention that he made a &#8220;racist&#8221; remark that deserved swift retribution by the oppressed victims of slavery.<br>

		<p>To be blunt, it looks like the &#8220;honor student&#8221; walked up and tried to hit someone from behind - then he was hit from behind and was shortly sent to the next world. I hate to be so cynical, but when the media uses the term &#8220;honor student&#8221; to describe black and hispanic &#8216;victims&rsquo; in situations like this, all I can think of is Tom Wolfe&rsquo;s novel &#8220;The Bonfire of the Vanities&#8221; (forget the horrible movie) wherein a black thug (who dies from injuries sustained during an attempted robbery) becomes an &#8220;honor student&#8221; in the eyes of the MSM. All because a school official notes that because &#8220;the kid&#8221; showed up for school most of the time, that &#8220;&hellip; makes him an honor student around here.&#8221; Either way, it&rsquo;s interesting to see how &#8220;activists&#8221; are already on the move, blaming the system, the powers that be and eventually the racism of whites for this typical example of black behavior. </p>

		<p>For you non-Chicago area folks, Roseland was a beautiful neighborhood until about 1970.  It had a variety of Irish, Italian, Dutch, and Lithuanians.  Many in the community had hoped that the confluence of two interstates might stop their neighborhood from decay but the barriers came crashing down in a matter of two years.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine lived in Roseland and I visited him in 1969 and again in 1971.  In the former visit, we walked around the area, shot the bull and had a great time.  By 1971, he urged me to either not come by or plan to stay in the house if I did arrive.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a wonderful area COMPLETELY going to Hell in barely two years?  I have driven through there several times since and it is an absolutely slum in which last Friday&rsquo;s murder is completely believable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more like 45 years, since the Kennedy administration began to throw money at the black gangs.  The Kennedy administration thought that the black gangs were some sort of organized crime.  If they bribed the leadership, the leaders would control the members.  But blacks are incapable of organizing anything, including crime.<br>

<p>The black polo shirt and tan pants are the school uniform.  So they all wear them.  The idea is to prevent theft of their brand label clothing.  The thefts of clothing and shoes is bad enough, but it is usually accompanied by savagery.  Also prevents the continual drain on parent&rsquo;s income as the kids compete in the stylish clothing race.  Also keeps the girls covered up and looking like school girls rather than hookers.</p>
<p>The attack took place right near the school.  You know how it is near a high school at 3/pm.  4,000 kids crowd the sidewalks.<br>

On the one hand, I won&rsquo;t want it to happen because I don&rsquo;t want President Obama to be able to take credit.  (Though I think his going to Copenhagen is a clue that Chicago will get them, he certainly wouldn&rsquo;t go there to be embarrassed.)  On the other hand, I want Chi. to win because they&rsquo;ll be saddled with all that debt which will take a century to pay back, and hope beyond hope that Chicago cuts race pandering and welfare programs in earnest.  On the other hand to that, we would get the bill for that debt, especially considering who is in the White House right now.</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s czar to be, Van Jones, stated that only white kids commit something like Columbine. That may be true; Columbine took actual work and planning. In Chicago, it may take a lot more time, but you get the same effect as Columbine when 30 or so kids are shot to death every year. How many kids are killed annually by gunfire in the Fargo, ND or Sioux Falls, SD school districts?  I would be willing to bet that less than five have been shot in the last 50 years (and most of those were probably hunting accidents). </p>
<p>When my mother was in elementary school back during the depression, her principal (who was also the fifth grade teacher in a 6 room schoolhouse) picked her to deliver something to the principal of the black elementary school three blocks away. When she arrived, what caught her eye was that this principal had a baseball bat on her desk. At least in the days of segregation, the talented 10th had the foresight to enforce discipline on the community. This is a prime example of what happens in this community when those people are gone. They were like the sealed lid on a bubbling cauldron. </p>
<p>Is Rev. Pfleger going to call for two-by-four &#8220;control? Are white people going to have to fill out some registration form every time we visit the hardware store to buy something that could conceivably be used as a weapon? How about video control so more embarrassing incidents like this don&rsquo;t end up on Fox or YouTube. </p>
