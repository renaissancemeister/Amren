<h1>UNC-CH Chancellor Freezes Activist Group</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse James DeConto, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), Sept. 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>UNC Chancellor Holden Thorp shut down a campus anti-immigration group Friday after an anonymous flier targeted its faculty adviser, who then joked about his skills with a Colt .45.</p>
<p>Activists put out the flier at UNC-Chapel Hill this week revealing the home address of Youth for Western Civilization faculty adviser Elliot Cramer. Protests at speeches sponsored by the group led to seven arrests and a broken classroom window last spring.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, chapter President Nikhil Patel warned Cramer by e-mail that the flier included his name, photograph, home address and telephone number with the caption, &#8220;Why is your professor supporting white supremacy?&#8221; It encouraged students, faculty and community members to urge Cramer to withdraw from organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I&rsquo;d let you know so that you can plan for some sort of protection,&#8221; wrote Patel, an Indian-American who denies the group is white-supremacist. &#8220;It seems like an indirect threat to your safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for your concern,&#8221; Cramer replied just after midnight, copying Thorp. &#8220;I have a Colt .45, and I know how to use it. I used to be able to hit a quarter at 50 feet seven times out of ten.&#8221;</p>
<p>By Friday afternoon, Thorp asked Cramer to step down as the group&rsquo;s adviser.</p>
<p>&#8220;This email is highly inappropriate,&#8221; Thorp wrote to Cramer. &#8220;It is certainly not consistent with the civil discourse we are trying to promote.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cramer said that the flier didn&rsquo;t feel like a real threat and that his response to Patel was &#8220;off-hand&#8221; and &#8220;light-hearted.&#8221; He complied with Thorp&rsquo;s request to resign.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Patel, a senior biology major, thinks Youth for Western Civilization has 30 days to remain active while seeking another adviser, and he thinks the group will find one.</p>
<p>The group and its 10 members &#8220;got censored&#8221; by the &#8220;threatening&#8221; flier and Cramer&rsquo;s &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; joke, Patel said. Neither he nor Cramer embrace all of the group&rsquo;s ideology, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is sympathetic to the fact that it should be able to exist and express its own opinions,&#8221; Patel said.</p>
<p>Youth for Western Civilization lost its first faculty sponsor in June when physics and astronomy professor Chris Clemens resigned, saying the national organization was too provocative for the local chapter to carry on constructive dialogue with campus leftists.</p>
<p>In April, Students for a Democratic Society and other protesters had shut down a speech by the group&rsquo;s founder, Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado congressman, calling his group racist and white-supremacist.</p>
<p>This week, Thorp, who apologized to Tancredo personally in April, offered up to $3,000 for the group to invite another speaker to campus. Youth for Western Civilization had been planning to sponsor a speech in October by former conservative commentator Bay Buchanan in a reprise of her appearance in March.</p>

		<p>Absolutely disgusting   &mdash;   first, intimidate the faculty adviser into quitting and then ban the group because it doesn&rsquo;t have a faculty adviser.  Kind of like robbing someone of all he&rsquo;s worth and then arresting him for being destitute.  These college administrators will do anything in the name of fighting &#8220;hate.&#8221;</p>

		<p> So the chancellor wants &#8220;civil discourse&#8221; now that those who are angry and protesting are conservative White people   &mdash;   not leftist minorities and self-hating Whites. That&rsquo;s interesting. People of his ilk seemed to have no problem when conservative rallies were being intimidated and broken up by the left, did they?</p>
<p> How many conservative campus speakers have been shouted down and even physically driven from auditoriums and other meeting places in the past few years by such &#8220;free speech&#8221; supporters? They want freedom of speech only for the speech they agree with   &mdash;   the hypocrites.</p>

		<p>Why is nobody here filing lawsuits?  Why do conservatives in this society have such a block about going after people in court?  One of the ways the multi-cult financed itself during it&rsquo;s rise to power was by suing it&rsquo;s opponents and looting their assets.  It&rsquo;s long overdue we returned the favor&hellip;</p>
<p>If I were Cramer, I would sue everybody involved in this.  So what if these antifa punks have no money now?  I&rsquo;d get a lien on every cent they&rsquo;re going to make for the next twenty years.  And as for the university, they have plenty of money and like most large institutions, a preference for settling out of court.  So why isn&rsquo;t he doing it? </p>
<p>God, I&rsquo;m so tired of nice White people&hellip;</p>

		<p>This whole thing was carefully scripted and choreographed between Cancellor Thorpe and Dr. Cramer with the goal to bring about the death of the UNC-CH chapter of Youth For Western Civilization. The only thing about the script and choreogaphy though is that they have a couple of defective premises related to first and second amendment rights. </p>
<p>The first is that retired UNC-CH psyhcology professors lose their constitutional rights to bear arms in their own off campus private residences when they accept a position as an advisor to an on campus UNC-CH student organization. The second faulty premise is that the same person loses his first amendment rights to make a public declaration of his skills with firearms in response to a real or perceived threat.</p>

		<p>Students for a Democratic Society and other protesters.  Check out the SDS website.  No names. no names of leaders, no names of organizers, no names of members.  A.K.A A MOB.  Anytime I get into conversations concerning race, immigration, etc. I am countered either with mob mentality anger and uncontrolled emotion, or I face a blank stare, as of one who is incapable of  intelligent response.  Youth for Western Civilization is very small in number, but no matter to the lefties.  They have NO tolerance of anyone whose views threaten their narrow world views.  Calling people the same old names   &mdash;   white supremacist, racist, anti-semitic, etc. is carrying less and less weight.  There is no moral leadership(with very few exceptions) left in academia. So be it.  They are doomed to fail.  </p>

		<p>THIS is the response that we should always give when accused of being &#8216;white supremacists&rsquo; or &#8216;racists&rsquo;:<br>
So white people who simply want non-involvement with other races - i.e. to simply live with their own kind, are &#8220;white supremacists&#8221;? That&rsquo;s like calling a woman who refuses a man&rsquo;s sexual advances a &#8220;female supremacist.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Good to know these same people who shouted their liberal rants in the 60&rsquo;s demanding the right to free speech (and were afforded those rights even though they tore up everything) are vigorousley defending their beliefs for others.</p>

		<p>SDS eh?  Many of you probably weren&rsquo;t alive in the heyday of the 60&rsquo;s to know the true face of SDS.  These clowns were a terrorist organization, marxist in ideology, and were behind the bombings and burnings of ROTC centers, police stations, etc. Even so, they were never banned from college campuses at that time, and more often than not, the members on a campus were not even students, but twenty and thirty year old agitators engaging in what the marxists call agit-prop.  Stir up violence and protests, then back away and let the incited mob take the brunt of the police containment, arrests, and as in Kent State, the fire from national guard.  It seems our college campuses are still run by girly-men, or outright SDS grads and SDS participators from the 60&rsquo;s.  No surprise there.  Our State Department is now run by an SDS grad, and public defender of domestic marxist terrorists.  Our President&rsquo;s buddies are from the Alinsky schools of agit-prop, and his buddies are marxist terrorists from the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. How far they&rsquo;ve come, huh?  Anybody would think we&rsquo;ve already lost the culture war politically and better hunker down for the real bullet in the back of the head persecution that&rsquo;s coming.  Extreme statement?  Look to history.  That&rsquo;s the final solution to dissent Marxists come to when gaining full power.</p>

<p>These sorts make me puke.  &#8220;Students for a Democratic Society&#8221;, who shut down speeches because they disagree with them?  Theres a group in the UK called Anti-Fascist Action, who try and stop the BNP holding meetings and press conferences.  Who&rsquo;s the Fascists here?</p>
<p>Remember, North Korea calls itself &#8220;The  Democratic Republic of Korea&#8221;, and East Germany used to be called &#8220;The German Democratic Republic&#8221;.  Good hardline, oppressive Communist countries both. </p>
