<h1>Defense Attorney Says Cell Phone Video Vindicates 5 Men Accused in Hofstra Rape Case</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Eltman, Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Sept. 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A prosecutor was considering Thursday whether to file criminal charges against a Hofstra University freshman who recanted claims that she was gang-raped by five men in a dormitory bathroom.</p>
<p>The student, whom officials have declined to identify, has been suspended from school pending a disciplinary hearing, said Hofstra spokeswoman Melissa Connolly.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman also said that a suspension against Rondell Bedward  &mdash;  the only Hofstra student among the five men implicated  &mdash;  had been lifted.</p>
<p>The attorney for another of the accused men, 20-year-old Kevin Taveras, said a video of the sexual encounter confirms reports that the victim was not forcibly attacked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks more like a porn movie,&#8221; Victor Daly-Rivera said. &#8220;It showed just the opposite of what the allegations were. There was no tying up, there was no bruising, there was no screaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice revealed that the 18-year-old accuser had recanted and said the sex with the five men had been consensual.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rice said in a statement that after the woman changed her story, her office began </p>

		<p>The victim flunked a lie detector test and totally recanted her accusations of rape.  She was drunk and allowed it to happen.  Maybe the boys piled on after the first. That happens in those situations.  </p>

		<p>New York Post identifies the non-victim as 18-year-old freshman Danmell Ndonye.  Sounds African.</p>

<p>On the subject, I just know that we&rsquo;re going to get troll white libs or the usual suspects of black drive-by posters saying juvenile things.  If there&rsquo;s anyone to blame, it should be the authorities that patrol the area around Hofstra, (NYPD?) that didn&rsquo;t give one critical thought to the supposed victim&rsquo;s story.  Perhaps the New York media can also be blamed.</p>
<p>However, can you understand why any one of us would have jumped to this leap of faith and assumed the suspects were guility?  It&rsquo;s not like black men are incapable of rape.</p>

		<p>The reporting is very sketchy, but if she did lie she has to be prosecuted.  They need to investigate this and get it resolved.  If they think she lied she needs to be prosecuted.</p>
<p>But the reporting is very weak on this story.<br>
A cell phone video of sex with five guys in a bathroom?  Who was controlling the video?<br>
And it was consensual??  Was this for money?  Or supposedly just for fun?  Did she know the guys, or were they strangers?  Was there some coercion off camera?  For instance, if you pull a knife one someone, they would likely consent to giving up their wallet, etc.  Who was controlling the camera.</p>
<p>They also need to get the motive for her lie (assuming it was a total lie).  How did the police track these guys? Did she know them by name?  Was her cell phone actually stolen? etc.  What is the motive of her to accuse them.  Does she have a history of mental problems, any other false allegations? </p>

		<p>It seems that it was consensual.  That shows the state of sexual morality at a modern day U.S. university.  Now consider that many American parents get themselves into debt on the order of $80,000 or so to send their child to such a place.  What are they <b>thinking</b>?<br>

		<p>It does not say in this article, but other news sources report the girl&rsquo;s name as &#8220;Danmell Ndonye&#8221; clearly not a white girl, but another African. I attend Hofstra, and in my opinion, none of these people belong on my college campus. I feel that if there were no affirmative action, many of these hoaxes and actual crimes would not have occurred, such as the armed robbery on campus the other day.</p>

		<p>The girl in question is black. This will disappear down the memory hole for sure. Think not? Heck, if this pillar of African virtue were white we would have to endure months of the Marxists bombarding us with programs about the plight of minority men, how white women find them irresistible, how they have to fight off white women with sticks, how the spurned white women make up rape accusations when rejected &hellip;</p>
<p>And if it were white guys in this situation, well, we&rsquo;ve already seen what happened at Duke. Same thing would happen all over again. </p>

<p>Good post.</p>
<p>Yes, this whole sorry affair is an artifact of racial integration, whether it gets sliced the way it was at first, or the way it is now.</p>
<p>And if everyone involved had been white, I&rsquo;d still say that in part it would be an artifact of racial integration, because instead of blacks being raised up by integration as was the intention, whites have been lowered by it in every way.</p>

		<p>Good thinking by the black youths to get the incident on videotape.  Black women, especially immigrants, are all too eager to send American blacks to jail rather than own up to their sexual depravity.  These men certainly weren&rsquo;t upstanding citizens, but they didn&rsquo;t deserve to be persecuted on false charges.  Send the false accuser to jail for the time her false accusation would have cost these men!!!</p>

<p>&#8220;She lied. She had consensual sex with all four of those men and then falsely accused them of rape. The sex was captured on camera phone video, which shows its was obviously consensual. All four men have been released and exonerated. Hopefully, these clean-cut and undeniably innocent young men have learned a valuable lesson about cavorting with trashy little girls. &#8220;</p>
<p>Regardles of the race of the female, there is a question of the treatment of women in general here and status of the male as a gentleman.  What can we say about &#8220;clean cut&#8221; young men who all pile on for group sex with a woman?  Was she drunk?  There seems to be a indication of that.  As a young man, I had several chances for sex with young women who didn&rsquo;t really know where they were or who they were with.  I declined each time and rather saw to it that they got home or back with their friends.  Further, I later volunteered at Rock Concerts for 14 years and helped many a young woman out of what would have probably been a bad situation because they were high and not in fully in control of themselves.</p>
<p>These men may have not technically raped this young woman, but they are not decent in any sense of the word.  They are just animals who got away with it this time.</p>
<p>By the way, camera videos of sex get posted on the internet all the time.  These &#8220;clean cut&#8221; young men will likely post their escapade on the net next.</p>
<p>What a world.<br>

<p>Whiteplight, you were a well brought up young man and are to be commended. </p>
<p>Frankly, when I was in college in the 50s and early 60s when women were much less promiscuous than they are today, on big weekends half the guys I knew were trying to get their dates drunk enough that they could persuade them to have sex.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t in a fraternity, but from the stories I heard, I believe there were plenty of events on fraternity row comparable to the event we&rsquo;re discussing.</p>
<p>There are some acts that are clearly rape, and some that clearly aren&rsquo;t, but there are a very large number of sex acts where the line between rape and non-rape is very blurry. And a lot of acts where the woman might not feel like it&rsquo;s rape at the time, but her feelings honestly change later, and with justification (even though in the man&rsquo;s mind, rape might have been the furthest thing from what he thought he was doing).</p>
<p>As far as I know, the law doesn&rsquo;t have a separate category for these borderline acts. Every act must be decided to be a rape or not a rape.</p>
<p>But as for black sexual predation vs. white sexual predation, Dept. of Justice statistics show that the percent of whites who rape white women would have to triple or quadruple to equal the percent of blacks who rape white women.</p>
<p>And the same statistics show that the number of whites who rape black women is virtually zero (And didn&rsquo;t that zero black woman who was not raped by the Duke Lacrosse team get considerably more publicity  &mdash;  understatement of the decade  &mdash;  than the 30 or 40 thousand white women who are raped annually in the U.S. by blacks?)</p>

That brings up a very interesting legal point: how did she (and he/they) feel about it AT THE TIME   &mdash;   not in hindsight the next day when she or they had sobered up.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t give your consent today, and decide it was rape tomorrow.</p>

		<p>The whole upshot is that she had consensual sex with five men at the same time.  Heteropaternal superfecundation is supposedly rare, but with the combination of world-class black promiscuity, combined with black women having better odds of two-egg twinning (Rushton), it makes me wonder how rare it really is.  If you don&rsquo;t know what heteropaternal superfecundation is, it means twins who have different fathers.  </p>

		<p>Prosecution is certainly warranted here.  When one lies to investigators about a misdemeanor offense, one has committed misdemeanor &#8220;false reporting&#8221;.  When one lies to investigators about a felony (like rape) it is felony &#8220;obstruction of justice&#8221;.  This is what got Martha Stewart her one year split-sentence (half in a prison camp and half under house arrest).</p>
<p>Since this dim bulb was so eager to ruin the lives of five men, she needs to take the consequences; lock her up for a year and then deport her back to Togo.</p>

		<p>  I can think of few things so unappealing as serial coitus! The thought of &#8220;going where many men went before&#8221; disgusts me, even as a male.  I doubt they were using condoms, but even if they were, it is still repulsive and obviously IMMORAL~! &#8220;Our&#8221; society is so sex-crazed today.  It is astounding that people can do their jobs adequately when so many are drifting off thinking about carnality. What a world and a time we &#8220;live&#8221; in!</p>

<p>The scottsboro boys raped those girls.  6 black boys invaded a railroad boxcar, attacked and threw the white boys off the railroad car and then gang raped the 2 white girls riding in the freight car.</p>
<p>The scottsboro boys were gang rapists and assaulted and battered the white boys. Guilty as charged. The girls were not prositutes as claimed by the liberals. Years later one of the girls recanted the rape charges after a substantial payment by liberals.</p>
<p>The communist party of the USA used the legal defense fund to raise money for the party.  Most of the money went to the party, not the scottsboro defense, just like the Sacco Vanzetti legal defense fund money went to the CPUSA.</p>
<p>There were 6 scottsboro boys.  CPUSA sent their Mothers around to snivel and sob at the fundraising events.  At one point the CPUSA had EIGHT!!!!, EIGHT!!!! so called Mothers of the 6 boys running around raising money for the CPUSA.</p>

		<p>There was an article in the NYPost today.  She was at the party with her boyfriend.  They got separated.  He went looking for her, couldn&rsquo;t find her, went to her dorm room and knocked on her door.</p>
<p>She opened the door all disheveled.  He could tell she had been having sex.  He was not happy.  She told him she had been raped. He told her they should immediately report the rape to campus security. She said no, it&rsquo;s okay. </p>
<p>He persuaded her to report it (just like the college sexual harassement lectures tell the students to do.)</p>
<p>So they reported it.  Lucky for the boys, one of the boys made a video of the episode with his cell phone.</p>
