<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Aurora, CO police have released a new picture of Honduran national Daniel Hernandez-Ramos, 20, and are asking the public for help in apprehending the accused child rapist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aurora Police Detective Bob Friel said: &#8220;He took advantage of the fact that, here&rsquo;s a 4-year-old, defenseless, little girl on her own in a parking lot and it sickens us to see this kind of thing happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because he [Ramos] is in this country illegally and has no permanent address or valid employment records, police are having a difficult time locating him.</p>
<p>Hernandez-Ramos is about 5 feet 8 inches tall and 150 pounds. He has a tattoo on his arm, a heart with flames, with the name &#8220;Daniel&#8221; on or next to the heart.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Daniel Hernandez-Ramos, is asked to call Aurora Police at 303-627-3100, or if you wish to remain anonymous, call Crime Stoppers at 720-913-STOP (7867).</p>
<p>Aurora, CO has come under harsh criticism for the city&rsquo;s &#8216;sanctuary policy&rsquo; for illegal aliens, which has led to several serious crimes in that city as of late.</p>
<p>On July 14, Walter Oleksinski, 62, was killed in Aurora by two illegal aliens who were drag racing one another. Both Benny Sitinjak, 34, and Jose Hernandez-Castellanos, 28, were charged with Class 3 vehicular homicide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With his first arrest in 2003, Castellanos had actually been arrested by Aurora police seven times for offenses including disorderly conduct, failure to appear in court, and assault. He had also been arrested five time in Denver (another city with a sanctuary policy), including an arrest for DUI in September 2008.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that neither city allows their police departments to inquire into an arrestee&rsquo;s immigration status, nor to report illegal aliens to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, Castellanos continued offending, and has now killed an innocent man.</p>

		<p>For those of you who are thinking that the Stupid Party is your salvation, think again. They are the ones who did practically nothing when the illegals were flooding across our borders. They did nothing when cities declared themselves havens for these invaders. Their leader is the one who let two border patrol agents rot in jail. They WILL BE the ones who will push for amnesty, and they WILL BE the ones to put Obamacare over the top when it comes to a vote. If they send you letters asking for donations, do what I do. I write&rsquo; DROP DEAD&rsquo; and &#8216;GET YOUR MONEY FROM THE ILLEGALS&rsquo; on the form.</p>

		<p>Norfolk/Newport News are the only places I have traveled in that I was truely frightened while traveling main roads in the day time. The convenice stores have kiosks made with armored doors and bullet proof glass. The cops hardly ever get out of their squad cars. Thugs of all colors patrol their turf around the clock. I had my wife take out the 357 and hold it in her lap because every traffic light was a possible confrontation.<br>
     I can see why this piece of junk lived the high life there. Both Vick brothers are from there. As hoorible as Atlanta is, it can`t hold a candle to Norfolk. There are so many illeagal aliens there that if the cops held them for immigration the jail would be filled up in a week. The illeagals are the enforcers for the black drug cartels. Welcome to Obama`s America.<br>

<p>Obama&rsquo;s been president for, what, a whole EIGHT MONTHS now?  Yeah, this is all his fault, as a matter of fact, there was no sign of this during Bush, Clinton, Bush, or Reagan,  It all started in January of this year.</p>

		<p>Thank you, #3, Charles B. Tiffany!  I was considering moving to VA Beach, VA   &mdash;   right next door to Norfolk.  I am hereby removing that city from my list of possible retirement locations.  That leaves Asheville, NC and Knoxville, TN.  I&rsquo;m leaning towards the TN area, but, I&rsquo;ll need to scout it out in the future.</p>

		<p>Funny thing about this site:</p>
<p>Whenever a Mexican, or a Salvadoranean rapes or kills someone there are like 3-7 comments, a black gets 50-100.  Why do you guys think that is?</p>

<p>Because most whites have always known that rape and murder are culturally acceptable national pastimes in Hispanic countries, whereas due to the internet most whites are just now beginning to realize the astonishingly disproportionate extent of the violent crimes committed by blacks against whites, crimes that have long been censored by the mainstream media&hellip;       <br>
