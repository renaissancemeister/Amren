			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), Sept. 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Tesco checkout girl chosen to model for the supermarket&rsquo;s autumn advertising campaign is in Britain illegally, it emerged today.</p>
<p>Fatou Cham, 32, who is from Gambia, West Africa, came to the UK in 1998 on a student visa but stayed after it expired in 2001.</p>
<p>Miss Cham, who works at the Tesco store, in Beckton, east London, was one of six staff members chosen from hundreds of hopefuls to model the Florence and Fred clothing range for an ad campaign used in women&rsquo;s glossy magazines.</p>
<p>Next to a picture of Miss Cham modelling a blue dress and heels were the words: &#8216;Designed by F&F.; Priced by Tesco. Modelled by Fatou, checkout number 6, Tesco, east London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Immigration officers questioned Miss Cham at her home in East Ham, east London, on Monday.</p>
<p>Miss Cham&rsquo;s solicitor Jamil Trawally told the Sunday Mirror: &#8216;I am sure she was brought to the attention of the police because of the Tesco campaign.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Cham told the newspaper: &#8216;I came here for a better life and never set out to deceive anyone.</p>
<p>&#8216;I just want to stay here with my family and be happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said she had been excited to be chosen for the Tesco campaign and had hoped it would bring her other opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8216;Now it has all gone horribly wrong,&rsquo; she added.</p>
<p>Miss Cham initially came to the UK to study banking, economics and finance at London Metropolitan University.</p>
<p>Her mother and eldest child were allowed to join her in the UK in 2000. Her two other children were born in Britain.</p>
<p>Miss Cham applied to stay in the UK when her student visa ran out but was refused permission.</p>
<p>A further application in January this year was also turned down and she has appealed to the High Court.</p>
<p>When Miss Cham joined Tesco in 2002, overseas citizens just needed a national insurance number to work in the UK but since 2004 they have been required to have a valid work visa, although this did not apply to those already in employment.</p>
<p>A Tesco spokeswoman said: &#8216;As soon as we were made aware of this issue by the UK Border Agency we co-operated fully with the investigation.</p>
<p>&#8216;We carried out all the checks required by law and the authorities have confirmed that they are satisfied that we followed the correct procedures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A UK Border Agency spokesman said: &#8216;The UK Border Agency expects people with no right to be here to return home voluntarily, if people do not we will remove them.</p>
<p>&#8216;Last year we removed 5,400 foreign national prisoners, and more than 66,000 people were removed or returned home voluntarily.</p>
<p>&#8216;Enforced removal is always a last option and the Agency always encourages those here illegally to return voluntarily.</p>
<p>&#8216;Support is available offered through our Assisted Voluntary Return scheme, managed by the independent International Organisation for Migration (IOM). </p>
<p>&#8216;This scheme offers a tailored package in kind to help people both prepare for their return and also with their resettlement back in their home country.&rsquo;<br>

		<p> Phew! well just as long as she is kicked out of Britain we can all breathe a sigh of relief. One unwelcome and not wanted family gone and only a few millions more to go.<br>
What a crock this is.  The immigration authorities know that there are tens of thousands of would be UK haters pouring in annually along with the wannabees,the grafters, criminals and economic migrants, but they don&rsquo;t seem to be able to get down to kicking the whole sorry bunch out. Just one or two headliners  now and then to show they really do mean business. Nauseating.</p>

		<p>Asking them to leave voluntarily and go back to the trash heap of a country they came from is like asking a fox to stay away from the chicken coop.</p>
<p>Too bad this individual didn&rsquo;t have the sense to maintain a low profile. Well, too bad for her, but the rest of the UK doesn&rsquo;t need any more illegal aliens. Now if they could just get the other million illegals to be gone would be nice.</p>

		<p>Miss Cham told the newspaper: &lsquo;I came here for a better life and never set out to deceive anyone.</p>
<p>At least not until her visa expired and by then she had TWO (2) children and she is MISS Cham? more welfare parasites with baby daddie(S) somewhere living off of her and the British taxpayer. SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;.nothing will happen to her, she has anchor babies.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised Oprah or Tyra Banks isn&rsquo;t here to save the day.  But a 32-year-old to begin a modeling career (and a Mother of illegitimate children)   &mdash;  - good luck!  And by the way, nice photoshopped picture, the hair weave looks decent, too. :D</p>

		<p>Seriously, do the Tesco people really think this model will attract shoppers?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll do my future shopping at Sainsbury&rsquo;s or Waitrose.</p>

<p>That statement is an all-out lie.  The minute she stepped foot on British soil, she has no intention of leaving, ever.  This is evidenced by the fact that her drug her family here before her visa expired then commenced to having two more children.  I would assume that her mother and eldest child mentioned in the article are illegal as well.<br>
I would also assume that she never graduated from the university since she is employed as a cashier.  Too busy having anchor babies.</p>

		<p>Why publishing her in the media, because she is a model? This is all rubbish, people out there are very jealous, if she was a normal illegal immigrant no one cares about the media, I would like to appeal to the whole of Britain to stop going to The Gambia for holidays or settlement because the british don&rsquo;t like anyone in their own land.<br>

		<p>If this one is the face of Tesco, I do not want anything from Tesco and I do not want to support teir activities with my money.<br>
 <br>
Sad because I have shopped in the local tesco for years now, it iis very convinient and also cheap.<br>
Whenever I can, I try to boycott companies who actively engage in bringing down our white society. Choosing a third worlder as the company&rsquo;s face qualifies for that title in my book.</p>
<p>Is Aldi, Lidle or Auchan any better?</p>
