<p>Surrounded by middle-aged white guys  &mdash;  a sepia snapshot of the days when such pols ran Washington like their own men&rsquo;s club  &mdash;  Joe Wilson yelled &#8220;You lie!&#8221; at a president who didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But, fair or not, what I heard was an unspoken word in the air: You lie, boy!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Wilson clearly did not like being lectured and even rebuked by the brainy black president presiding over the majestic chamber.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Wilson&rsquo;s shocking disrespect for the office of the president  &mdash;  no Democrat ever shouted &#8220;liar&#8221; at W. when he was hawking a fake case for war in Iraq  &mdash;  convinced me: Some people just can&rsquo;t believe a black man is president and will never accept it.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/27120.html">Dems See Race Factor for Obama Foes</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Jonathan Martin, The Politico, September 14, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Eight months into Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidency, as criticism of his administration seems to reach new levels of volume and intensity each week, the whispers among some of his allies are growing louder: That those who loathe the nation&rsquo;s first African-American president, and especially those who would deny his citizenship, are driven at least in part by racism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feeling that&rsquo;s acutely felt among those supporters of Obama who are themselves minorities. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as African-Americans are concerned, we think most of it is,&#8221; said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), when asked in an interview in between sessions how much of the more extreme anger at Obama is based upon his race. &#8220;And we think it&rsquo;s very unfortunate. We as African-American people of course are very sensitive to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.), chairman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, agreed with his colleague that elements of the opposition can&rsquo;t accept the reality of a black president.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Virginia Governor and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine used a speech Friday to single out those conservative critics whose hostility toward President Obama goes deeper than just opposing his policies  &mdash;  but without mentioning that which many in his party believe drives the anger.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He demurred when asked later whether this often-personal criticism is rooted in contempt for a president who happens to be black.</p>
<p>Other Democrats, not as constrained by the office they hold, are more outspoken about what they see as the racism aimed at Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think all of it is!&#8221; exclaimed Gwen Dawkins, a Democratic activist from Michigan and retired state employee when asked to what degree the fervent opposition to Obama was driven by his skin color.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic strategist and a DNC vice-chair declined to, as she put it, &#8220;put all the president&rsquo;s opponents in a box,&#8221; with regard to their motivation. But she said more and more average African-Americans are approaching her with grave worries about Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re worried sick about his safety,&#8221; Brazile said. &#8220;When they see some of these statements, the guns at his rallies, some of the hate talk on TV and radio, there&rsquo;s a natural tendency because of the wounds that built up for centuries without being addressed to worry. It&rsquo;s a natural concern for them to worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republicans see an important distinction between Obama critics who are genuinely worried about his tax, spending and national security policies and those whose fears go beyond the president&rsquo;s liberalism.</p>
<p>But for some Democrats, it&rsquo;s difficult to make that distinction when conservative marchers take to Washington bearing images of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Obama that read, &#8220;He had a dream, we got a nightmare,&#8221; and when a Southern congressman shouts at Obama while he addresses Congress in a demonstration of disrespect never seen when a white president spoke in that hallowed hall.</p>

		<p>Wilson clearly broke the House rules and breached decorum.  For that he should have and did apoligize.</p>
<p>But now he is rightly saying &#8220;no more.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The president was lying.  Wilson&rsquo;s only fault was saying so in that forum.  </p>

		<p>If Obama was truly interested in America has a whole, and not just blacks and communists there would not be this anomosity.  If he: 1) brought home our troops, 2) closed most of our overseas military bases, 3) sealed our borders, 4) started a plan to get rid of illegals, 4) proposed a plan to bring manufacturing back to our shores, 5) allowed domestoc energy exploration, 6) deported HB aliens so American IT professionals could get jobs, 7) stopped all legal immigration (allowing us to absorb what we have, give our own a chance at jobs and protect our environment, 8) treat the PM and Queen of our ownly real allie with the same respect he shows to the Saudi King, and 9) at least pretended not to be a racist he would be loved.  And all of the above would benefit black Americans as much as whites.  But no, he wants to Mugabe-Marx the US and people are catching on.  Even some blacks.</p>

		<p>&#8220;and when a Southern congressman shouts at Obama&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why the distinction of Southerner and not just &#8216;congressman&rsquo;? Are we alluding to some type of rascism associated with the south?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;while he addresses Congress in a demonstration of disrespect never seen when a white president spoke in that hallowed hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sort of like being booed by a GROUP of democrats during a 2005 State of the Union Address? I doubt one lone &#8216;booing congressman&rsquo; would have the same impact as the 2 words uttered instead. Wilson will prove to be more loved than not.</p>
<p>It still remains to be proven how the historically rascist nature of the Democrat Party is not STILL WITH THEM IN SPIRIT to this day! </p>

		<p>One thing I have to give American blacks;they are uniformly consistent. Of course they could never imagine pulling the lever for evil ol whitey,due to their blind hatred for whitey. Yet they instantly ascribe ANY critique of their guy as evidence of blind haterd on the part of whitey. The country is unraveling, thank God. Whites are waking up in droves to the scam of diversity. I look forward to the next year as Obama&rsquo;s rigidly hard left agenda hits even rougher seas. For the past 40 years  I have agonizied over the continuous deconstruction of white America. Hope beckons! I believe Obama will go down as the president that sparked the second american revolution.</p>

		<p>The ever so shrill Maureen Dowd, as you can read in the original article, tried to make an issue of Joe Wilson&rsquo;s membership in the SCV.  Of course what are the odds that a white man in the deep South is a direct descendant of a Confederate soldier?  Like, Duh.  Also, about the only place where saving the Confederate flag is controversial is in the staff office of the New York Times.</p>
<p>As for Donna Braziele, I will never forget that in October 2000, as the Presidential race was at its apex, and Gore was constantly behind Bush by a 4-6 margin, Braziele said that all the Gore campaign needed to do was to keep their polling numbers within the margin of error, and then she &#8220;could get five points on the ground.&#8221;  And I think she meant black voter fraud, i.e. all those mysterious dimpled and hanging chads, in Florida.</p>

<p>This is a disingenous statement.  No one may have yelled at Bush during a press meeting or such, but the Left provided many signs of disrespect for him as president and the office he occupied.  In fact, I remember the entire discussion about respect for the office topic at that time.  Doud is hoping that everyone has short attention spans ans will still respond to accusations of racism.</p>
<p>To H2$$ with it, NO, I don&rsquo;t like seeing this country led by an inexperienced man, a black man, who is clearly showing his own racism through the way he is racially stacking every government post with non-whites that he thinks he can get away with.  NO, I don&rsquo;t like what this means for this country socially.  The evidence is already there nightly on television.  Now white women are often depicted as sluts coming on to educated professional black men who are disgusted by them!  Ha!  But insults like this occur now daily in the media.  </p>
<p>No wonder some white citizens have formed &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; and screaming.  (Too bad they don&rsquo;t understand The Constitution themselves).  They just aren&rsquo;t being truly clear about what they really hate.  IF they ever do figure it out, I will shout with them.  But not while they are pretending they care about more government or someone new getting medicare benefits, or having to actually pay their way because they actually have lots of money, but are enjoying their own swindle at everyone else&rsquo;s expense.  </p>
<p>I will be happy to eat my words if all those Tea Party people will drop out of their government benefits packages, including Medicare right now.  My guess is that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to afford their motor homes and the campaign they have been on.  They&rsquo;d be going to the Meals on Wheels cafeteria where my wife and I take our surplus vegetables to feed the needy seniors.</p>

Ms. Dowd has her race sensor set too high.</p>
<p>We have a clear example that these people aren&rsquo;t hearing what we&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>How do you have a conversation with someone who is reading your mind and finding unspoken insinuations in every choice of word or phrase?</p>
<p>Liberalism is a kind of mental illness characterized by an inability to see reality. Talking to a liberal is pointless since they know how the conversation will end. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s so true.  We hate BO because he&rsquo;s black, just like we loved &amp; adored &amp; revered all the other presidents because they were white.  Like Nixon; remember how everyone loved that guy &amp; never had a bad word to say about him?  and Bush of course, no one ever criticized him for anything.  </p>

		<p>I believe when these &#8220;mindreaders&#8221; read racial antipathy into others, it&rsquo;s a simple case of psychological projection whereby they see in others what is actually in their own minds. However, if we assume that what they say is true, then this country has an incredible number of hypocrites who say Obama&rsquo;s race isn&rsquo;t important but believe otherwise. But It would also provide ample evidence that our multiracial experiment really won&rsquo;t work.</p>

		<p>Who cares what these black racists think. The only thing they know how to run are their mouths. The only reason they&rsquo;re throwing out these racisim charges is because they&rsquo;re terrified that the White folks are waking up and their free ride will be comming to an end. When black folks get loud over something, that means we&rsquo;re doing something right. I do that when I&rsquo;m not sure who to vote for in an election, I just find out who the blacks want and then vote for the other guy. </p>

		<p>People think Obama has received so much support from liberals because they want to use him as a black trojan horse to sneak a socialist program into the country. Liberals hope that criticism of his program will fail because he is black. People opposed to this socialist strategy are correct to emphasize that Obama is black. </p>

		<p>This man was elected because of his race therefore his supporters assume we are against him for the same reason.In my case they would be correct. Our so called color blind media has no problem pointing out the race of Obama&rsquo;s critics and making assumptions about their motives based on that observation.Blacks voted for this guy en mass.Whites have every right to oppose him en mass.We need to have more aggressive spokesmen.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out if the Dowdy Spinster was beaten as a child or just spurned by one of the white males she despises so much. I was no fan of George Bush, but the invective hurled at him during his eight years was intense to say the least. One slight remark (albeit in the august halls of Congress, not in good form) is enough for the lefties to cry with indignation. Bring out the smelling salts! <br>
As for the Dowdy spinster, she&rsquo;ll probably go out with the NY Times when they finally do fold. </p>

		<p>In the original piece, Dowd claims that Obama was never beaten up for being black. The reality (per his autobiography) was he was beaten and persecuted and nearly killed (by being forced over a bridge into water when he couldn&rsquo;t swim) because he is half-black. His tormentors, however, were Asians (Indonesian children). Interestingly, Asians never seem to figure much in Obama&rsquo;s racial views. Interestingly too, is the fact that Dowd has NEVER BOTHERED TO READ HIS FRIGGIN&#8221; AUTOBIOGRAPHY! These people claim to be journalists, for Chrissakes! How hard is it to read his book? Where in the world do people get their ideas about Obama from? The man is racially obsessed and flat-out admits it in his autobiography and subsequent book! He refers to himself in the following manner:&#8221; I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views.&#8221; (The Audacity of Hope). He admits that the carefully crafted image of a racial unifier is the creation of other people (See: Axelrod, David).</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p> As Hitler said; &#8220;How fortunate for politicians that men are fools&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Flip through the op-eds of any major newspaper/newsweekly (cf. Dowd, above), and/or the reasoned sagacity of our electronic commentariat (the Mahers and Moores, the Shusters and Olbermanns and O&rsquo;Donnells, the - but why go on? They&rsquo;re beyond counting), and three notions-cum-suspicions leap out at me:</p>
<p>1. Race is real, but only sometimes, when it benefits the Left;</p>
<p>2. If Balkan-style unrest and violence come to America, it won&rsquo;t be the &#8220;racists&#8221; initiating the hostilities - they&rsquo;ve long since <i>already</i> been initiated by our Best and Brightest;</p>
<p>3. The Internet, that venue of information, opinion and personal expression once loudly championed by the Left (just as loudly abandoned when it evolved into a refuge and buffer from DNC/MSM groupthink), is presently being demonized as a necessary precursor to government control and restriction &#8220;for the greater good&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course I could be wrong. But I doubt it.</p>

		<p>Why should the presidential office,Barack Obama or any president be respected? </p>
<p>Maurenn Dowd is a childless fifty-something White Female. That is to say, she is a defective White female.</p>
<p>If it is about race, it would be wonderfull. For it would mean that there is a nascent but growing White racial conciousness. </p>
<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s election was an enormous expression of black,hispanic,asian ans muslim racial conciousness. They didn&rsquo;t even bother to hide it. In fact,after it was announced that Barack Obama won the election, the taunting of Native Born White Americans-specifically White Males-took off with great enthusiasm. It began with the taunts of  multimillionaire mulatto Soledade O&rsquo;Brian(married to an investment banker).</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans will either politically organize around their legitimate racial interests or face race-replacement within the borders of America-the nation they founded and created. And with racial minority status will come massive discrimination and other nasty stuff.</p>
<p>You have to be completley insane to put you and your families fate in the hands of blacks,africans,asians,hispanics and muslims. Defectives such as Maureen Dowd and Chris Mathews are demanding that WE do this. They are demanding that Native Born White Americans commit racial suicide. WE are under no obligation to do this.</p>

		<p>Wow, reading the comments section, you would think the entire country was populated with self-hating-white, liberal idiots, as opposed to just one-third.</p>
<p>_______________________</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ve found liberals (i.e., illiterate idiots) tend to comment the most on the internet. This is because hard-working Whites are generally at home taking care of their hopefully large White family, homeschooling, and ensuring the next generation of supermen arises while the Left postpones childhood till age 45 and hates themselves out of existence. Keep up the good work, guys. I&rsquo;ve never come across a group of people more articulate and intelligent anywhere else on the Web.</p>

		<p>Ms Dowd, the shrill harpie that she is, cant find any rational reason why anyone would  disagree with our new black caesar.  She would be the first to say to any conservative that politics is rough sport; yet she has to race to the defense of BO and create a racist comment where none existed by putting words in Wilsons mouth. </p>
<p>I dont read this womans work, but when I come across it, I cant help but sense the inner desperation she has to please her leftist progressive cohorts. Maybe you were the homely girl n 3rd grade who no one liked Ms Dowd? Thats what I see.  Maybe I can make a career of writing what Ms Dowd &#8216;really&rsquo; means! </p>

		<p>He wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but damn, I loved and voted for Alan Keyes.  Of course, I&rsquo;m assuming he&rsquo;s one of those very rare 3-digit IQ blacks, with decent emotional control.</p>
<p>What a shame those racist, bigoted blacks never got behind him.  But then, what would you expect from a group with such low intelligence? </p>

		<p>Why people care about what childless ugly white and self hating spinster said?</p>
<p>Childless people are irrelevant, their genes are gone, they obviously hate all humanity for this reason alone.</p>
<p>Childless people should not even be allowed to express any opinion.</p>
<p>She hates white males because no one wanted her for many reasons.<br>

		<p>THEY (the Dems, liberals, pundits, and media) WILL KEEP ACCUSING ANYBODY WHO DISSENTS FROM THEIR MARXIST PROGRAM OR MARXIST PRESIDENT AS SOLELY MOTIVATED BY RACISM.</p>
<p>IGNORE IT. IGNORE THE ACCUSATIONS AND DRIVE ON.  This is their oldest and most successful ploy, to accuse and name call folks who aren&rsquo;t on board with their marxist programs as somehow racist.  It&rsquo;s high time we, and every conscienable honest voter and politician IGNORE THAT PLOY AND RENDER IT USELESS ONCE AND FOR ALL by ridiculing publicly and forcefully every numbskull who uses it.</p>
