			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Seema Mehta, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>High school dropouts, who are more likely to commit crimes than their peers with diplomas, cost the state $1.1 billion annually in law enforcement and victim costs while still minors, according to a study being released today.</p>
<p>The California Dropout Research Project at UC Santa Barbara found that cutting the dropout rate in half would prevent 30,000 juvenile crimes and save $550 million every year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Drop-out statistics are notoriously difficult to pinpoint, but according to the state Department of Education, nearly 19% of students don&rsquo;t graduate from high school. In Los Angeles County, the figure is more than one in five, and at some L.A. schools, fewer than half of students graduate within four years.</p>
<p>The California Dropout Research Project previously studied the economic effect of not finishing high school and found that for each group of 20-year-olds who fail to complete high school (roughly 120,000 per year), the economic loss is $46.4 billion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Dropout prevention is crime prevention,&#8221; said Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, chairman of the board of the nonprofit Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a bipartisan effort by law enforcement officials and crime victims. &#8220;Schools need better tools for identifying potential dropouts so they can target interventions at the kids who need them most.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The solution is simple.  Give every human being in California a high school diploma as a civil right of his or her turning 18 years old, if s/he hasn&rsquo;t earned one already or is on the path to earning one.  Therefore, there will be no more dropout problems, and all these social ills will disappear.</p>
<p>N&rsquo;est pas?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Dropout prevention is crime prevention,&rdquo; As far as I am concerned they should just give all students a high school diploma on the first day they start high school. Look how much more crime they can prevent. I mean how much of a difference is the four years of High school education going to make to Hispanic youth. The mexican government does the smart thing. They encourage their hispanic youth to leave mexico since they decided that they are uneducable.</p>

		<p>The real problem isn&rsquo;t school drop outs it is immigration. I grew up in Southern California and I can say that most of the blacks and Mexicans I went to school with did not want to be there, they made their disatisfaction at attending school known frequently every single day, they constituted a disruptive presence for those of us there who actually were trying to pay attention and get their work done. </p>
<p>Keeping people in school who don&rsquo;t want to be there is no way to prevent crime. We need to deport non-whites to their countries of origin. That is a real solution. As I understand it most High Schools in my area now have to have armed police there all day because of the crimes that minorities commit AT SCHOOL. Keeping them in school isn&rsquo;t going to lower crime, they will instead commit more crimes at school.</p>

		<p>LAs dropout statistics are faked.  Kids who don&rsquo;t return after the summer aren&rsquo;t counted as dropouts at some schools, only kids who quit mid semester.<br>
     I can just imagine the pride of the faculty when my high school opened in 1958, knowing that in 50 years, fully one out of eight entering freshmen would earn a diploma.  <br>
     At Garfield High School, inspiration for the movie &#8220;Stand and Deliver&#8221;, the special education kids pass the exit exam at a higher rate than the &#8220;normal&#8221; kids, and that&rsquo;s after 2/3 of them have dropped out.  <br>
     Teaching is largely wasted on Hispanics.  </p>

		<p>The California Dropout Research  Project completely ignores the fact that the ones that drop out are on average much less intelligent than the ones that dont, and therefore will have a much higher criminality rate than the ones that dont.There are lies, there are damn lies, and then there are statistics(Mark Twain).</p>

		<p>I think part of the solution is to end immigration. It&rsquo;s time for a time out. Another part of the solution imo is to give every parent of every child in America a voucher and let them decide where they want to send their child to get educated. Public schools would compete directly with private schools. If this resulted in a mass restructuring so be it. Should parents decide they want their children being educated in private schools, then public schools would consolidate selling off the unneeded properties bringing revenue into the state treasuries and resulting in a much better education with higher graduation rates for the children. </p>

		<p>Why do these &#8220;researchers&#8221; continually fail at basic logic?  Correlation does NOT equal causation.  Dropping out and committing crimes are both common traits of low-IQ people with poor impulse control.  </p>

		<p>9 Jill: The researchers know that correlation does not mean causation.  They are lying, in order to provide academic cover for other liars in the media and in politics.  The left has built an enormous tower of deceit, that cannot bear even casual inspection.  That&rsquo;s why colleges have speech codes: Define the questioning of racial orthodoxy as &#8220;hate speech&#8221;, and you don&rsquo;t have to answer any questions.  </p>
