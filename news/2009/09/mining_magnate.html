<h1>Mining Magnate Clive Palmer Attacks &#8216;Racist&rsquo; Treatment of Chinese</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Walker and Michael Sainsbury, The Australian, September 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE nation&rsquo;s fifth-richest man, Clive Palmer, has denounced the federal government&rsquo;s foreign investment rules as racist, claiming they are weighted against Chinese companies seeking to buy into Australian resource projects.</p>
<p>The Queensland-based mining magnate warned that Chinese investors would not tolerate &#8220;the idea of being discriminated against because of the colour of their skin&#8221;.</p>
<p>Contrasting an exemption allowing US investors to invest up to $953 million in an Australian business without foreign investment approval with the tight controls applying to the Chinese in the resource sector, Mr Palmer said the absence of a &#8220;level playing field&#8221; could cause Beijing to spend its estimated $1.8 trillion in cash reserves elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve got the opportunity to grab that if our politicians could only be fair and treat the Chinese people and Chinese government with the dignity they deserve,&#8221; Mr Palmer said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should the average American, regardless of his education or qualifications, have the right to invest $950m in Australia but the average Chinese person, regardless of how much money he has, is not allowed to invest without our Treasurer saying so?&#8221;</p>
<p>His comments, to a business lunch in Brisbane yesterday, come at a time when the standoff over the detention in China of Australian businessman Stern Hu, knockbacks under foreign investment rules of a series of Chinese resource investments and a defence white paper identifying China&rsquo;s military build-up as cause to boost the Australian navy have strained Sino-Australian relations.</p>
<p>Foreign Investment Review Board director Patrick Colmer last week warned Chinese investors to talk to the advisory body first, before signing deals.</p>
<p>Two Chinese government-backed companies, Wugang Australia Resources and China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Co, have been on the wrong end of recent national interest decisions on resource investments in South Australia and Western Australia respectively.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s ambassador to China, Geoff Raby, yesterday sought to further calm tensions on the eve of the ruling Communist Party&rsquo;s 60th anniversary celebrations tomorrow, saying Australia did not see China as a military threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously China&rsquo;s own defence spending is rising very rapidly,&#8221; Mr Raby said in a rare interview via online video with the China Daily. &#8220;We think that is as it should be, given the growth of the Chinese economy and the need for modernisation of the Chinese armed forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our white paper is not about any particular nation, or source of threat, but rather looks at the range of contingencies that the Australian government needs to look at in the next 10 to 20 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Raby said the bilateral relationship was &#8220;excellent&#8221;, with Australia and China&rsquo;s leaders meeting &#8220;regularly either bilaterally or at the margins of major international conferences&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is our second-largest trading partner, and there are something like 120,000 Chinese students studying in Australia,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So which ever measure you want to use, it&rsquo;s a very busy, dynamic relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Palmer this week returned from an investment mission to China, where he was drumming up support for his company&rsquo;s $7 billion development in central Queensland&rsquo;s Galilee Basin, combining a giant new coalmine with a purportedly &#8220;clean&#8221; power station, rail and port upgrades.</p>
<p>The larger-than-life businessman has a personal wealth of $3.42bn, making him Queensland&rsquo;s richest and the fifth-wealthiest nationally. Mr Palmer let fly at Wayne Swan, who is responsible for the Foreign Investment Review Board, referring to the Treasurer as a &#8220;goose .&Nbsp;.&nbsp;. or waterfowl of some description&#8221; and warning that he would go to the High Court at the first opportunity if one of his developments was affected.</p>
<p>Mr Swan&rsquo;s office hit back last night with a statement playing up Mr Palmer&rsquo;s financial support for the Liberal National Party in Queensland.<br>

There was a time when western businessmen thought of their own people along with profits.</p>
<p>Today, they only see profit and western nations see none.</p>

<p>Because (most) Americans, like (most) Australians, are white.  Wow, there&rsquo;s a real brain buster.</p>
<p>The biggest reason why formal ties between China and Australia are foolish is because Australia only has 19 million white people, and there are 1.3 billion Chinese.  In fact, there are more Han Chinese in China than there are white people in the whole world.  If only 2% of China moves to Australia, whites are an instant minority.</p>

		<p>This is a global problem; however, I used to think it was solely an American problem.  Then I woke up.  That is, rich white folks are traitors no matter what flag they live under.  I am beginning to despise white people.</p>
<p>Is this guy another one of the robber barons that causes whites to be vilified throughout the planet?  You know the kind.  The ones that preach one thing for us but practice something else for themselves.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to answer my own prior question.  Who is Clive Palmer?  Barf&hellip;  a friend of the late Ted Kennedy.  No wonder he&rsquo;s on the name-calling bandwagon.  Another traitor who should be run out of town!!! (Of course, that&rsquo;s putting what I&rsquo;m thinking mildly.)</p>
<p>Read it and puke:</p>

		<p>The jerk is transparent to me.  He is exploiting the idea of racism in order to attain cheap labor and thereby make more money for his greedy, lousy, self.</p>
<p>He ought to be refered the article about the Chinese mother/black father in China who isn&rsquo;t accepted.  Not that he would put 2+2 together.</p>

		<p>Clive palmer is not what he seems. Mr Palmer is a very machiavellian character, serving only his own interests. He is saying this because a)the chinese are the biggest customers for the minerals his company mines, and b)he will directly benefit from their investment into the mining industry.</p>
<p>These laws are in place because of an incident a few decades ago where the japanese bought up mineral companies and started selling to themselves at ridiculous prices. I dont hold it against them, it was a logical course of action, just as protecting the interests of australians are logical.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s probably the reason he&rsquo;s whining about it. He probably has a sweetheart deal(s) ready for him in Chinese markets if he can get the investment rules changed in Australia. </p>

		<p>I find my self unwillingly forced by the behavior of incredibly wealthy capitalist traitors to consider the advantages of socialism, albeit a socialism with a nationalist bent.  The Scandinavian sort of socialism is devoted to the destruction of their own people, just like this Clive Palmer.  There must be a middle way.  </p>

		<p>Another example of a globalist who would sell out his native land for money.  Does anyone in Australia recognize that China is a racist, expansionist, dictatorship that would readily turn Australia into its defacto colony???  And 120,000 Chinese students in Australia&hellip;.talk about a fifth column and network of potential spies!!!</p>
<p>If anyone has not noticed, it has become fashionable for the elites in the West to applaud the expansion of Chinese power and influence.  This is just one example of many to come.</p>

		<p>Who in their right mind would sell the countries resources to a communist dictatorship. Australia/BHP would not selling shares to another company but to the Chinese government itself.  Imagine selling the suppliers &amp; resorces to your own customer.<br>
Nuts Mr Palmer you have a hidden agenda here.</p>
<p>That same dictatorship refused to sell a share of some orange fruit drinks manufacturer to Coca Cola about a year ago. This was disallowed by the Chinese government so I guess mr palmer won&rsquo;t be calling that racism after all only white people are racists.</p>
<p>Keep calling us racists &amp; we&rsquo;ll finally say OK lets be racists AND lets act like racists.</p>

		<p>Comment No.3  &mdash;  Question Diversity.  If one looks around Sydney, you would soon feel that 2% of China has already moved here.  The amount of Chinese around is stifling, let alone the multitude of other ethnic tribes that have swamped Australia in recent times.  My sense of belonging to the city I grew up in has (sadly) disappeared.  The thing I can&rsquo;t figure is that most whites seem brain dead to what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t a white person be allowed to own property in Hawaii?  Why should a white person in Zimbabwe be forced to give up his farm?  Why should a white person be forced to include non-whites, they can freely discriminate against other not of their race?  </p>

		<p>I understand the expatriated Chinese form an elite in Indonesia and Malaysia.This community has played a powerful role in the political development of those countries. Revolutions have been spawned as a result of native discontent with the Chinese community correctly perceived as closed, discriminatory and not loyal to the nation which hosts them. I wonder if the whites of Australia will prove themselves to be normal and resent and oppose Chinese domination. Perhaps not; perhaps they will fall victim to the political errors that seem so characteristic of later Anglo-Saxon cultures.</p>

		<p>Australia should limit Chinese investment for the same reason Tibet should. Oh, wait. It&rsquo;s too late for that now isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>The fact is that despite Australia&rsquo;s large size it is for the most part a desert continent that cannot support a large population. It has a small population of only 19 million. If it doesn&rsquo;t take steps to maintain it&rsquo;s sovereignty it will become a colony of another country. This isn&rsquo;t so much a problem with the United States because American businesses is significantly separate from government. That line isn&rsquo;t so clear with China. China&rsquo;s government and military are highly involved in business. And they would use that involvement against Australia.</p>

<p>I had a chatroom buddy, born and raised in Casula, and lived in Wollongong for awhile.  He told me that in his lifetime, Sydney first was filling up quickly with Lebanese, and now is getting many Chinese.  Where he is right now, I don&rsquo;t know, which is not surprising, as he himself said that Australians (the real ones, that is) tend to be the most transient of all whites.  Last e-mail I got from him, he was in Brisbane, but he has also had stops in Townsville and a few other places. </p>

<p>When was that?  From my research, the capitalist class and their precursors have always been traitors.  Until recently, Western Civilization held money, greed and commerce in contempt.  Men who engaged in commerce were thought to be dishonorable and unfit to lead.  </p>

		<p>Judging by the total corruption and lack of any respect for laws and regulations of the Chinese business community in the US I would say that keeping Chinese out is the only way to keep the business honest.</p>
<p>Chinese businesses are basically ongoing criminal enterprises.  Tax evasion, total disregard of zoning and other regulations and slave labor are the least of their crimes.</p>
