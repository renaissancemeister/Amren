<h1>Immigrant Population in California Declines</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Don Lee and Alana Semuels, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than three decades of rapid growth in the country&rsquo;s foreign-born population came to a halt last year, census data show, as surging unemployment made the U.S. economy less attractive to outsiders.</p>
<p>In California, which has a long history of attracting immigrants, the number of foreign-born residents actually declined, shrinking 1.6%.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is clearly a consequence of the economy, with the biggest impact on Mexican and low-skilled immigrants,&#8221; said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who analyzed the census figures, which are to be officially released today. &#8220;It shows that these immigrants respond to the economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nationwide, the number of foreign-born residents fell an estimated 99,000, or 0.3%, to 37.97 million.</p>
<p>The data come from the Census Bureau&rsquo;s annual survey of about 3 million Americans, not the entire population. The survey&rsquo;s margin of sampling error is high enough to make it possible that the number of foreign-born people in the country actually remained unchanged from 2007 to 2008 rather than declined. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the figures suggest a dramatic break from a long wave of increasing migration to the U.S., particularly from Asia and Latin America, that followed a major change in immigration policy in 1965.</p>
<p>In the two decades that preceded 2008, the country&rsquo;s foreign-born population grew an average of almost 1 million a year, including by nearly 512,000 in 2007.</p>
<p>In California, the number of foreign-born people dropped 165,000 last year to 9.9 million. The reversal in the state was driven by several Southern California counties with sharp declines, such as Los Angeles, with a slide of 3%, San Bernardino, down 3.6%, and Ventura, down 4.1%. Orange and Riverside counties showed smaller decreases.</p>
<p>But the slowing of the increase in California&rsquo;s foreign-born population began well before the latest recession, said Dowell Myers, a professor and urban demographer at USC. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new census data, which come from the bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey, an annual poll begun this decade, show the biggest drops last year in foreign-born residents were in California, Arizona and Florida  &mdash;  three of the states hit hardest by the recession. Texas, whose economy has outperformed most other states, saw the biggest gain, followed by Georgia and New York.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-09-20-brain-drain_N.htm">More of World&rsquo;s Talented Workers Opt to Leave USA</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Emily Bazar, USA Today, Sept. 20, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>More skilled immigrants are giving up their American dreams to pursue careers back home, raising concerns that the U.S. may lose its competitive edge in science, technology and other fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was a trickle has become a flood,&#8221; says Duke University&rsquo;s Vivek Wadhwa, who studies reverse immigration.</p>
<p>Wadhwa projects that in the next five years, 100,000 immigrants will go back to India and 100,000 to China, countries that have had rapid economic growth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Suren Dutia, CEO of TiE Global, a worldwide network of professionals who promote entrepreneurship, says the U.S. economy will suffer without these skilled workers. &#8220;If the country is going to maintain the kind of economic well-being that we&rsquo;ve enjoyed for many years, that requires having these incredibly gifted individuals who have been educated and trained by us,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Wadhwa surveyed 1,203 Indian and Chinese immigrants who had worked or been educated here before returning to their homelands and found the exodus has less to do with the faltering U.S. economy than with other factors:</p>
<p>•Career opportunities. At NIIT, an information technology company based in New Delhi, about 10% of managers in India are returnees, mostly from the U.S., says CEO Vijay Thadani.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>•Quality of life and family ties. People return to India to reconnect with their families and culture, Dutia says. &#8220;They have a support system there, family and friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>•Immigration delays. Multinational companies that belong to the American Council on International Personnel tell Executive Director Lynn Shotwell that skilled immigrants are discouraged by the immigration process, she says. Some can wait up to a decade for permanent residency, she says. &#8220;They&rsquo;re frustrated with having an uncertain immigration status,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They&rsquo;re giving up.&#8221;<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical how they can make a deduction that it&rsquo;s a dramatic break when the immigrant numbers either decreased slightly or remained unchanged.  What happened?  Did they become naturalized citizens and thus disappear off the books?  Did the immigrant population decrease because they moved to other states?  The economy is bad right now and so it would make sense that fewer people would come here.  If the economy ever improves it will pick up again. </p>

		<p>One percent is not a significant decline.  Next week we will hear about the terrible labor shortage in every occupation from engineers to dishwashers because immigrants are no longer drawn to California.</p>
<p>Solution to the bogus labor shortage?  More welfare for illegal workers so their employers can continue paying them lower wages.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s called saturation. Saturation is the process or state that occurs when one substance is filled so full of another substance that no more can be added. That&rsquo;s California and the substance is Hispanics. California&rsquo;s woes are a direct result of saturating it with poor unsocialized Hispanics. <br>

		<p>This is not exactly a true decline. If the Latino population has increased (let&rsquo;s say) 2000% since 1950, a 2% decline is still a huge net increase. The deluge is continuing despite recent out-migration.</p>

But, I am sure the uneducated, unskilled illegal Mexican and S American immigrant will still remain hoping for an amnesty and because living in this country with nothing is still preferable to going home and having nothing.</p>

		<p>Jonathan - indeed it seems you are right on this, especially in terms of illegal immigrants. There are many places around the Blue Ridge Mountains that once had been full of illegals working in construction and driving down wages. Since the depression, almost all left because the construction industry folded there.</p>
<p>Illegals tend to be &#8216;good time folks&rsquo;. They don&rsquo;t care about the U.S., they just want what they can take.</p>

		<p>The amazing thing is that the only thing keeping the economies of India and China moving is western countries like US and UK buying all their goods and services. If this came to a halt or a strong leader began applying huge tarrifs to imports these people would once again be plunged into the stone age where they should be. The only reason for the success of these countries is that the white man has shipped his wealth there. Nothing more.</p>

		<p>I have to be cynical again,as I so often am on the illegal immigration issue. The fact that this story was reported by the Los Angeles Times newspaper, makes it totally suspect, and to me at least,irrelevant. There is hardly one single story that I can think of, that this paper has ever printed on illegal immigration, that didn&rsquo;t purposely mislead the reader.</p>

<p>Yes, we did need all those brilliant Indian scientists to get us stupid, non-creative, unscientific, un-technological Whites to the moon, didn&rsquo;t we?  And without Indian and Chinese scientists the computer industry would have never been created, right?  We certainly needed the Chinese and Indians to help us create the cell phone industry and advanced medical technology did we not?</p>
<p>And we certainly needed all those Indian and Chinese scientists to launch the satellites in the 50s did we not?</p>
<p>Here a few examples of Indian and Chinese space technology:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;First Indian satellite launch fails (2001)</p>
<p> BANGALORE, India  &mdash;  India&rsquo;s effort to enter the satellite launch market suffered a setback Wednesday (March 28) when the test launch of an experimental communications satellite was aborted a second before liftoff.</p>
<p>The aborted launch of the satellite was followed by a fire on the launch pad that engulfed one of four strap-on boosters used by India&rsquo;s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). The rocket was designed to lift the experimental payload into a 22,000-mile geosynchronous orbit of Earth&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2006:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Key Indian satellite launch fails<br>
 <br>
The explosion showered debris over the Bay of Bengal<br>
The launch of India&rsquo;s heaviest communications satellite has failed after the rocket carrying it veered off course and exploded&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And in 2009:</p>
<p>&#8221;..Bangalore, Jan 31 2009 (IANS) The very first communications satellite sold by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to the European operator Eutelsat has failed abruptly after five weeks in orbit&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Guess they didn&rsquo;t steal enough White technology.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that the Mexicans are leaving California to join their cousins in Oregon, Illinois, and North Carolina.  Why would they go home to Mexico, which is worse than when they left it?  </p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t doubt that the Chinese and Indians are leaving.  They have been trained at our expense, have gained experience and trade secrets, and have saved up what will be seen as fortunes in their homelands.  We might think that living in Calcutta or Shanghai is intolerable, but they don&rsquo;t.  They&rsquo;ll be welcomed by the best employers, and buy big houses with all the modern conveniences and have servants too.  <br>
     Why would they stay in America, a declining country full of foreign devils?  The Whites are bad enough, but there are increasing numbers of Mexicans, Africans, and Middle Easterners.  We have customs and laws that expect even Asian engineers to behave civilly to their inferiors.  No, the Hindus and Chinese love their own cultures as much as we love ours, and find our ways as distasteful as we find theirs.  Once they&rsquo;re rich, there&rsquo;s no reason to stay here.<br>
     Of course, the departing Asians will be replaced by younger ones, as long as it is profitable for them and tolerated by us.  Don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to get your old engineering job back.  </p>

		<p>The Chinese, Japanese and Indians have all had major problems with Rocketry and other areas of science (with less publicity) because so many of them suffer from &#8220;perfection blindness&#8221;. Those of you in IT etc. know what this means. Basically it stands for a mindset in which many of these people seem incapable of believing they&rsquo;ve made a mistake, even when you put it right in front of them. And especially if showing them that a white person did it correctly or created something. Some of this is innate I believe, some if it is cultural conditioning, and some of it is from the far-reaching arms of our anti-white media. The same anti-white media that lies to us, as it is doing with this article stating that the immigrant population here in CA has declined. Bunk. The illegals from South of the Border keep pouring in because they can survive on handouts from Uncle Sam, period. The other non-white immigrants, legal or otherwise, also enjoy the favored treatment handed out by the anti-white forces in DC. </p>
<p>Anyhow, this story is from the LA Times, which has been nothing more than a cheerleader for non-white immigration and non-white culture replacing whites for decades. This is why its readership has been in solid decline. </p>

<p>They have a culture of migrant workers that have long been useful to American capitalists.  </p>
<p>The problem is not them; who cares if they love Mexico and not America?  It is those who remain and seek permanance that are the problem.  </p>
<p>But even our own children don&rsquo;t seem to care much for America, let alone their own &#8220;race.&#8221;  Due to a voluntary military only a dwindling number of Americans learn partriotism as it becomes a professional military with higher and higher numbers of foreign born members.  Our youth, in most instances, cares most about making a quick buck and pop culture.  And all the technology that has been invented supports a shorter and shorter attention span.  This leads to superficiality that can only reinforce popular, superficial attitudes.<br>
