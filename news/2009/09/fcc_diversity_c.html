<h1>FCC Diversity Chief: GOP Hurts Civil Rights</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Eberhart, Newmax, August 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lloyd [Mark Lloyd, chief diversity officer at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),] claimed in a remarkable 1998 essay that communications policies enacted by Republicans negatively impacted the civil rights of minorities  &mdash;  further arguing that two decades of Republican communications policies had compromised the gains made by the civil rights movement in minority ownership in communications, according to a report by CNSNews.com.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bottom line: &#8220;The civil rights agenda has given way to the agenda of the commercial market,&#8221; wrote Lloyd. &#8220;The work of the civil rights community has suffered through a sustained assault by the right. The core of that assault is to deny funding to civil rights work, silence liberal voices, and set the agenda of public debate by an opposition that is better funded, more organized, and savvier about strategic communications.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, a 1998 report from the National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) concluded that FCC policies were not the primary reason for the minority gap in communications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minority broadcasters are finding it increasingly difficult to compete,&#8221; the report concluded. &#8220;Access to capital remains one of the most significant impediments to ownership for minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>The Past Is Prologue</b></p>
<p>A 2007 report sponsored by the FCC and acccomplished by researchers from Duke University found that while minority ownership had increased slightly, the reasons for the remaining gap between minority and white ownership was very much alive and well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the observed ownership asymmetries are economy-wide, they are undoubtedly linked to broad systemic factors,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;[T[he most direct explanation lies in unequal access to capital. Many businesses require individuals to sink substantial financial investments upon entry. This is likely to be especially true in media enterprises.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only way to change this, the 2007 report said, was to redistribute wealth or increase minorities&rsquo; access to capital markets. The report did not mention license terms, renewal procedures, or ascertainment.</p>
<p>&#8220;[I]n order to change ownership patterns we need to either change the aggregate distribution of wealth or otherwise increase access to capital markets,&#8221; said the report.<br>

		<p>That&rsquo;s because black talk radio is a farce, that devolves into yelling, screaming, stupid calls, professional callers that call every show every day, so much so that there might as well be subtitles, and overall unlistenability.  However, every major city needs it, so that whites can understand black hate and racism.</p>

		<p>To see an exaggerated example of why black-owned media fails, watch a few episodes of BET news (if you can stomach that much) and then imagine that competing with NBC, CNN, ABC, Fox, ect. None of those that I listed are completely reliable, but they&rsquo;re a lot better than BET. Maybe the writer and Mr. Lloyd need to consider that whites are still the number one consumers of media in this country. </p>

		<p>So now &#8220;civil rights&#8221; means the right to own a multi million dollar radio station.  It looks like I and that vast majority of other white people are being denied our civil rights.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;silencing liberal voices&#8221;, give me a break.  The only places where the conservative point of view gets expressed are the old medium of radio and the new medium of the internet.  If you want to hear liberal voices just tune in any of ABC, CBS, MSNBC, CNN, or National Public Radio, or read any newspaper.  My local bird cage liner, Newsday, will happily give you the pro-illegal immigration, anti-white point of view every day.</p>

		<p> Mark Lloyd is another member of Obama&rsquo;s grand conspiracy to completely change America.  He blames the &#8220;right&#8221; for denying funding to civil rights work and silencing liberal voices and he is  going to correct this wrong as Obama&rsquo;s Chief Diversity  Officer of the FCC by making private broadcasting companies pay licensing fees equal to their total operating costs to allow public broadcasting outlets to spend the same on their operations as the private companies do.  He goal is to make it financially impossible for companies like the ones carrying Limbaugh, Hannity and Levin to remain in business in the interestof &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  The American people is thankfully waking up with the Obamacare scam and hopefully it&rsquo;s not too late.</p>

		<p>This guy is a bigger bozo than Van Jones.  He&rsquo;s of the same ilk, however, a Marxist revolutionary radical.</p>
<p>If Glenn Beck hadn&rsquo;t brought out information on these retards we still wouldn&rsquo;t know about them, because the media either agrees with them or they&rsquo;re afraid.</p>
<p>This geek refers to operations in Africa, regarding manipulating communications policy, as if they&rsquo;re some kind of advanced model of the world.</p>
<p>When asked, Karl Rove said he meant no disrespect, but this guy wasn&rsquo;t too bright&hellip;..in so many words.</p>

		<p>Liberals don&rsquo;t understand the free market, and they don&rsquo;t care about it either. If no one watches or listens to your media product, you fail as a broadcaster. </p>
<p>A few black shows have made it with blacks; but their is not a black NBA nor a black NFL. Reality TV, awful as it is, appeals to all races, yuck.</p>
<p> What now? Subsidies for black oriented shows?</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, your talk shows aren&rsquo;t going anywhere.  Outlets like Rush are just that, outlets.  They allow you to vent some steam, as they say.  You all remember steam engines don&rsquo;t you?  They had a wonderful little device called a governor(state), that allowed the engine(you) to vent a little so as to impede an explosion.  Worked wonders.</p>

		<p>Wealth can&rsquo;t be &#8220;redistributed.&#8221; The only way to retain wealth is to earn it. If people don&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t earn, they can be given something, but very quickly lose it. </p>

		<p>A few months back i interviewed with a radio station to be a salesperson. The station was changing format from a Black station to a mixed. It would have conservative and liberal talk shows. <br>
The station manager was new and sweeping clean the workers. The problem was there were not enough whites to carry the water while the blacks sat out back smoking and jiving. <br>
Someone has to sell airtime that means somebody has to work hard. How many of you have seen Blacks in commission only sales positions. Very few.   </p>

<p>I get what you&rsquo;re saying about letting out steam to prevent an explosion. However, the real question is this: do the likes of Mark Lloyd and others in the Obama administration get it? They might not be thinking things through so well.</p>

		<p>Anonymous:  Strom Thurmond might have been genuine about his opposition to the civil rights revolution in 1964, but it was that year he changed parties, then gradually drifted away into neo-conism.  Four years later, Thurmond stabbed (figuratively) George Wallace in the back by convincing NC and SC whites to vote Nixon instead of Wallace.  That cost Wallace NC and SC, and therefore the chance to deadlock the Presidential election into the House.  Instead, we got pure Richard Nixon, with all his affirmative action and pandering.  Ironically, what Wallace tried to do in 1968, Thurmond himself wanted to do 20 years earlier.</p>

		<p>Redistribution of wealth means stealing from those who have assets in order to give to those who are incapable of managing assets.  Stupidest idea in history (except maybe for  Reconstruction).  We have GOT to get these redistribution idiots out of the Red (White) House and everywhere else.  If the blacks don&rsquo;t like it, let them go to a black-run paradise like Haiti, South Africa, Kenya   &mdash;   they can take their pick.  But seriously, a guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t takeover of the airwaves is a VERY scary prospect - we have to be sure it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

		<p>This is good actually.  The media is the propaganda arm of the demononiac party, ACLU, NOW, $PLC, ADL, LARAZA, MALDEF, AJC, Ford Foundation, Tim Wise and the rest of the &#8220;Whites must be eliminated&#8221; crew.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will be like the Chinese cultural revolution back in the sixteis and seventies.  All the professors, idiot intellectuals and activists who supported the communist takeover in China were the first to be killed.</p>
<p>With the demise of Bernie Madoff&rsquo;s ponzi scheme $PLC contributions have plummetted.  A government takeover of the media would be great.  The media is as anti White as the government anyway, so the media could not be any more anti White than it is today.</p>
