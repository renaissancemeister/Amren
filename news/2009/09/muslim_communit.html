			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Muslim community leader who claimed he was kidnapped from his home at knifepoint and dumped in woodland after a BNP hate campaign has been arrested for perverting the course of justice.</p>
<p>Noor Ramjanally, 36, alleged that he was abducted by two men, bundled into a car boot, driven to Epping Forest in Essex and ordered to stop his religious work.</p>
<p>The BNP had been accused of whipping up racial tensions in the area after it issued an inflammatory leaflet about Mr Ramjanally&rsquo;s Islamic community group  &mdash;  the first in Loughton.</p>
<p>His alleged ordeal became a cause celebre among the Muslim community both locally and nationally after it was reported in the national press.</p>
<p>But today, Mr Ramjanally was, himself, arrested amid suggestions that he made the whole incident up.</p>
<p>An Essex Police spokesman said: &#8220;A man has been arrested in connection with an ongoing police investigation into an alleged abduction in west Essex.</p>
<p>&#8220;Police were contacted on Monday August 24 by a man who stated that he had been abducted from his home in the Valley Hill area of Loughton.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Thursday September 3, police arrested a 36 year-old man from the town on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Ramjanally had also alleged that his Loughton home was firebombed in July and that he had received hate mail threatening his family.</p>
<p>Recalling the supposed abduction, he said: &#8220;I have got the whole UK Muslim community behind me now. I am not just on my own.&#8221; And after the alleged arson attack, high-profile community figures, including Loughton Mayor Ken Angold-Stephens, religious leaders, teachers and members of the police attended the hall where he holds prayer sessions in a show of support.</p>
<p>Telling of the &#8216;kidnapping&rsquo;, Mr Ramjanally claimed he feared he was about to be murdered when the car stopped and one of the kidnappers said &#8216;Let&rsquo;s do it here.&#8221; Instead, the pair were said to have marched him deep into the forest in silence before warning him: &#8220;We don&rsquo;t want the Islamic group in Loughton&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Married father-of-one Mr Ramjanally, said he thought the attack had been inspired by the BNP.</p>
<p>In the latest edition of the BNP&rsquo;s &#8216;Epping Forest Patriot&rsquo;, delivered to many households in Loughton, it attacked his hiring of a local hall on Friday afternoons for two hour Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer sessions.</p>
<p>Under a picture of a union flag being eaten away by the Islamic moon and crescent, the leaflet says: &#8216;In parts of neighbouring Redbridge and east London the Islamification process is almost complete.</p>
<p>&#8216;Cockney culture destroyed and East End community spirit just a fading memory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;The BNP love Loughton and we&rsquo;ll do all in our power to prevent Islam creeping into our town.&rsquo; The BNP, which has four councillors in the area, believes the Islamic group is a prelude to building a mosque. Its leaflet is headed in capital letters: &#8220;No mosques in Loughton!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Ramjanally said: &#8220;The men did not say anything about the BNP or who they were, but it is only the BNP who want my Islamic group out of Loughton.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;I believe the BNP campaign has inspired the violence.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This sort of thing is becoming a &#8220;dog bites man&#8221; story.  Maybe you can cut down on the news traffic by only announcing days when no member of a protected group fakes a hate crime against himself.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m no expert on these things, but it seems like in cases past, the media made a big deal about the original hate-crime, of course that means committed by whites, and then fell silent, so most never heard the rest of the story, when it turned out to be a hoax.</p>

		<p>To all our cousins in Europe: Now that you&rsquo;ve imported large numbers of non-whites into your nations you can look forward to them faking hate crimes on a daily basis just as they do in the USA.</p>
<p>You may also notice that the original hate crime story attributed to &#8220;racist whites&#8221; appears on the front page of your newspaper. When it&rsquo;s discovered to be a hoax days later that story appears on page 34 between the crossword puzzle, the horoscope and a toupee ad.</p>

		<p>The other major political parties in the UK take every opportunity to accuse the BNP as being racist and fascist despite the facts proving to be otherwise but the liberals and brain-dead in the UK,the latter being those who will believe anything thrown at them by the media, those who lack the ability to investigate and decide for themselves,BNP&rsquo;s message is being distributed especilly through their web site at www.bnp.org, now acknowledged to be read much more than the other political parties&rsquo; ones.  Some local govt. councillors have changed parties ad joined the BNP when they listen to the voters who tell them who they will be voting for in the next local election.  It is water dripping on a stone; hard, constant work, ignoring the radicals (including rent-a-thugs)who will use violence or break the law to argue against the BNP, a legally registered political party, so the future in Britain does not look so bad now, except for the trillions of $s that the current govt. (socialist/democrat?)has borrowed and spent due to their incompetence with the causes of the current credit crisis before it arrived.  It could have been prevented as in the USA.</p>
<p>Nil iligitumus carborundum.  Keep up broadcasting the facts to all in the elctorate: we all have to be forced to think -eventually.</p>

		<p>Honestly, I doubt if it is ONLY the BNP that wants his Islamic group out of Loughton.  The others just won&rsquo;t speak up.</p>
