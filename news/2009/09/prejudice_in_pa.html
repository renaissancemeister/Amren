<h1>Prejudice in Paradise</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Keller, SPLC Intelligence Report, Fall 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With no known hate groups and a much-trumpeted spirit of aloha or tolerance, few people outside Hawaii realize the state has a racism issue. One reason: The tourism-dependent state barely acknowledges hate crimes. That makes it hard to know how often racial violence is directed at Caucasians, who comprise about 25% of the ethnically diverse state&rsquo;s 1.3 million residents. Those who identify themselves as Native Hawaiian  &mdash;  most residents are of mixed race  &mdash;  account for nearly 20%.</p>
<p>Hawaii has collected hate crimes data since 2002 (most states began doing so a decade earlier). In the first six years, the state reported only 12 hate crimes, and half of those were in 2006. (All other things being equal, the state would be expected to have more than 800 such crimes annually, given the size of its population, according to a federal government study of hate crimes.) There was anti-white bias in eight of those incidents. But that doesn&rsquo;t begin to reflect the extent of racial rancor directed at non-Native Hawaiians in the Aloha State, especially in schools. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anti-white sentiments such as these have been more than 200 years in the making. The pivotal event occurred when American and European businessmen, backed by U.S. military forces, overthrew Hawaii&rsquo;s monarch in 1893 and placed her under house arrest two years later. The United States annexed the islands as a territory in 1898, and they became a state in 1959.</p>
<p>Little wonder then that as Hawaii prepares to observe the 50th anniversary of becoming the 50th state on Aug. 21, it will a muted celebration, devoid of parades or fireworks.</p>
<p><b>Classroom Warfare</b></p>
<p>Tina Mohr has lived in Hawaii for 25 years. She has Native Hawaiian friends. But in the 2003-04 school year, her twin blond-haired daughters, aged 11 at the time, began getting harassed by Native Hawaiian kids at their school on the Big Island. &#8220;Our daughters would come home with bruises and cuts,&#8221; she tells the Intelligence Report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The torment continued in the summer between 5th and 6th grades. Native Hawaiian girls stalked and threatened her daughters and yelled &#8220;fucking haole&#8221; at them. Midway through the 6th grade, Mohr began to home-school her daughters.</p>
<p>She filed a complaint with the civil rights division of the U.S. Department of Education in 2004. It was only recently, on Dec. 31, 2008, that the division finally released its report. The report concluded there was &#8220;substantial evidence that students experienced racially and sexually derogatory name-calling on nearly a daily basis on school buses, at school bus stops, in school hallways and other areas of the school&#8221; that Mohr&rsquo;s children attended.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report also concluded that school officials responded inadequately or not at all when students complained of racial harassment. Students who did complain were retaliated against by their antagonists. &#8220;They learned not to report this stuff,&#8221; Mohr says of her own daughters.</p>
<p>The Hawaii Department of Education settled Mohr&rsquo;s complaint with a lengthy agreement in which educators promised to take various steps to improve the reporting, investigating and eliminating of student harassment in the future. Today, Mohr&rsquo;s daughters are again attending the school where they used to have trouble. They haven&rsquo;t been assaulted, but one was threatened on a school bus earlier this year.</p>
<p><b>Racial Legacies</b></p>
<p>The resentment some Native Hawaiians feels toward whites today can be chalked up in part to &#8220;ancestral memory,&#8221; says Jon Matsuoka, dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Hawaii. &#8220;That trauma is qualitatively different than other ethnic groups in America. It&rsquo;s more akin to American Indians&#8221; because Hawaiians had their homeland invaded, were exposed to diseases for which they had no immunity, and had an alien culture forced upon them, he says. {snip}</p>
<p>Racial violence directed at whites in Hawaii, while deplorable, is minor compared to the larger issues underlying it, Matsuoka says. {snip}</p>
<p>Further fueling the resentment that some Native Hawaiians feel for outsiders are attempts by the latter to usurp entitlement programs given the former to redress previous wrongs. In recent years, non-native residents have used the courts to try and rescind these entitlements on grounds that they are racially discriminatory and violate the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Retired professor and &#8220;anti-sovereign&#8221; white activist Kenneth Conklin and others prevailed in a lawsuit in 2000 that challenged a requirement that trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs  &mdash;  OHA  &mdash;  be of Native Hawaiian descent. OHA oversees huge tracts of lands that the United States took from Hawaii when it annexed the islands as a territory, and collects revenues from them for programs that benefit Native Hawaiians.</p>
<p>The state government was going to sell 1.2 million acres of these lands to developers for two state-sponsored affordable housing projects when OHA and four Native Hawaiian plaintiffs sued to stop the deal. A state court sided with the government, but the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed in favor of the plaintiffs. This March 31, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the Hawaii high court erred and sent the case back for further action.</p>
<p>There also was an unsuccessful legal challenge to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, passed by Congress in 1921. The act allows a Hawaiian agency to make 99-year leases at $1 per year to Native Hawaiians (but not other residents) for authorized uses on lands ceded to the United States when it annexed Hawaii. More than 200,000 acres of land were designated for uses such as homes and ranches.</p>
<p>One of the more protracted legal battles involved a lawsuit filed in 2003 by a non-Native Hawaiian student against the hugely wealthy and influential private Kamehameha Schools. Kamehameha operates three campuses for the benefit of children of Hawaiian ancestry. The student&rsquo;s attorneys contended that violates civil rights laws. As the U.S. Supreme Court was about to announce last year whether it would hear the case, Kamehameha paid $7 million to settle it out of court.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;A Hateful Place&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>A violent incident with racial overtones in 2007 near Pearl Harbor prompted a good deal of soul searching about race in Hawaii. A Native Hawaiian man and his teenage son brutally pummeled and kicked a Caucasian soldier and his wife near Pearl Harbor after the soldier&rsquo;s SUV struck the other man&rsquo;s parked car. The son shouted &#8220;fucking haole&#8221; while attacking the soldier. The husband and wife suffered broken noses, facial fractures and concussions. A prosecutor said the assault was a road-rage incident, not a hate crime. But it generated much debate on newspaper websites and blogs about the use of the word haole and whether whites are the targets of racism in Hawaii.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a hateful place to live if you are white,&#8221; wrote a woman on one Hawaii website&rsquo;s comments section. A Hawaii native who is white wrote, &#8220;Racism exists in Hawaii. My whole life I&rsquo;ve never really felt welcome here.&#8221; A sailor stationed at Pearl Harbor added that &#8220;this island is the most racist place I have ever been in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other white residents, however, wrote that they had had no such experiences. And many people maintained that arrogant mainlanders are the most likely to incur natives&rsquo; wrath. It&rsquo;s their &#8220;cultural inability to be humble [that] is a huge contributing factor in a lot of violence against them,&#8221; one person wrote. &#8220;There is a high degree of arrogance and lack of respect that mainlanders exhibit,&#8221; added another.</p>
<p>A Hawaiian Studies professor at the University of Hawaii, Haunani-Kay Trask, is one of the most caustic critics of whites in the islands. In her 1999 book, From A Native Daughter, Trask wrote: &#8220;Just as .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all exploited peoples are justified in feeling hostile and resentful toward those who exploit them, so we Hawaiians are justified in such feelings toward the haole. This is the legacy of racism, of colonialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>State and Race</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s against this backdrop that Hawaii approaches its 50th anniversary of statehood. {snip}</p>
<p>Republican state Sen. Sam Slom learned that the hard way. Although Statehood Day is a holiday in Hawaii, there were no celebrations for about 10 years, until he organized one in 2006 at the palace. He and others were confronted by demonstrators shouting racial epithets. Slom, who is Caucasian and has lived in Hawaii since 1960, said the 30 to 40 &#8220;hard-core&#8221; protesters intimidated a high school band, which left early, as well as some spectators.</p>

		<p>So the admitted brutal assault by the Hawaiian and his son, was a &#8220;road rage&#8221; incident, not a hate crime, even after the derogatory term the Hawaiian boy screamed at the soldier and his wife. Millions of white Americans are clueless to the core.</p>

		<p>My lying eyes, is this the Southern Poverty Law Center denouncing anti-white violence and hate on the part of non-whites?  The SPLC has, in the past, denounced certain black radical groups, but the angle with those is that such groups espouse anti-Semitism.  Though the SPLC was too dense (or too intellectually dishonest) to realize that, as Chris Rock might say, black radicals don&rsquo;t delineate between Jewish whites and other whites.</p>
<p>Still, my suspicious mind still wonders what is the angle.  Perhaps a lot of SPLC donors live in Hawaii, and aren&rsquo;t exactly Kanaka Moali (what native Hawaiians call themselves in their own language.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a white nationalist - I can see this fellow&rsquo;s point, and agree with it 100 percent.  Whites today in America and elsewhere around the world, the average people, and not the arrogant elites - had no direct responsibility in what our rulers did to native peoples around the world, but we suffer the hate and resentment - that rightfully should rest at feet of the politicians who we didn&rsquo;t vote out of office when they tried to impose our way of life on unwilling people of other nations.</p>
<p>Our fault was that we allowed ourselves to be distracted with bread and circuses and ignored what the blue-suited criminals were doing up in Washington D.C.  </p>
<p>We need to change that behavior, friends.  We need to send a message to our so-called rulers that America needs to butt out of the affairs of other nations and mind our own business, just as George Washington (and Ron Paul) said we should.</p>
<p>Nobody, including whites, wants or likes to be force-fed the alien cultures of people unlike your own tribe.  That truth should not be hard to understand, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so wrong with showing mutual respect for the right of other people to preserve their unique culture and way of life?</p>

		<p>We are headed for a disaster.</p>
<p>There is extensive racial tension to say the least, and it will get worse.</p>
<p>America is trillions of dollar in debt.</p>
<p>The government deficit spends every year with no plan or hope of paying off the debt.  It&rsquo;s a giant ponzzi scheme.</p>
<p>Universities teach hatred towards whites, while whites are quietly reaching the breaking point of frustration.  </p>
<p>The government forces integration against the natural and strong tendency to self-segregate.</p>
<p>It is a catastrophe in making.</p>

		<p>I was trapped on Oahu for just over 2 years.  It began to suck about 3 weeks after arriving.  That&rsquo;s when I learned that Haole wasn&rsquo;t a quaint term of endearment.  White skin is a bullseye in most cases.  Some towns have an unwritten code similar to &#8220;Don&rsquo;t let the sun set on your Haole ass in Wahaiwa&#8221;.  Or the all too familiar &#8220;Haole boy, you give me you one wallet and I no kick you one okole (ass), eh Bra?&#8221;.  Most Hawaiian and Samoan men look like a bomb went off in a diving suit.  Few white women get near them.  They&rsquo;re freakin huge and have an IQ very similar to another minority group most Americans are all too familiar with.  And a similar inferiority complex that has them seeing themselves as victims of evil Haoles (whitey).  It&rsquo;s so amazingly familiar that people I know in Southern states think I&rsquo;m making it up.  But then, Hawaii is our southernmost state!  Most of the law is related to the criminals.  It&rsquo;s just a bunch of small towns in the middle of an ocean.<br>

		<p>Why anyone runs from the fat, dumb, Hawaiians is beyond me.  Whites are just too polite and convinced of their own culpability.  Hawaiians ought to think about what life would be like if NO ONE had come to their shores.  They would still be living in poverty, with a low sustainable population while the world passed them by.  But Hawaii is becoming more irrelevant to the U.S.  Certainly, we can&rsquo;t afford more presidential candidates the shoe-in via a Hawaiian birth.  I have known many whites who have lived or do live in Hawaii.  They have no patriotic inclinations at all.  They live there to escape from America most easily.  We ought to let Hawaii go back to being a U.S. territory or better, yet, become another Phillipines with their own Hawaiian factions fighting over the paltry leavings of a much reduced economic base.  That would be a fitting punishment.</p>

		<p>whenever I watch Dog the Bounty Hunter, I play a drinking game.  If Dog is tracking a white fugitive, I take a shot of scotch. It works out well for me because I don&rsquo;t drink. It also angers me that many of the fugitives Dog goes after are Samoan immigrants. Remember, the US government won&rsquo;t let whites move to American Samoa; to preserve the racial makeup.</p>

<p>I visited Hawaii back in 1991 and learned something interesting from in-laws living there (they&rsquo;ve since moved to California): Homeowners in Hawaii own only the building   &mdash;   <i>not</i> the land it sits on.</p>
<p>Interesting that the article says nothing about the natives&rsquo; attitudes towards the Japanese, who IIRC comprise the largest ethnic group in the state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sticking by my longtime prediction that Hawaii will be the 2nd state to secede, after Alaska. Then the whole house of cards will come crashing down and Obama will go down in history as the <i>last</i> US president.</p>

		<p>Ask most whites who&rsquo;ve lived in Hawaii and they can tell you it isn&rsquo;t only the native Hawaiians and the Samoans who go after whites. The &#8220;native&#8221; Japanese for example constantly pull little passive/aggressive stunts to annoy and attack whites. I have relatives there, and one time a minor incident in a store almost turned major until I stepped in to stop a large Hawaiian troublemaker picking on a young, small nephew of mine. The only reason the Hawaiian backed off is because I was as heavy as him but taller (I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;3&#8221;, 240) and I wasn&rsquo;t fat like him - and it would have been one on one (despite their size, Hawaiians and Samoans are known for very, as in extremely weak chins - just watch them in MMA and in boxing). However, as with most non-whites, he bolted out the door, off to get reinforcements. We pulled out of the store lot and saw that the angry punk had somehow instantly found almost 20 more of Michener&rsquo;s wonderful people to aid him in a group beat down. We just drove away while I gave a single digit salute to the army of poi eaters. My brother told me this kind of thing goes on all the time. </p>

<p>This paragraph&rsquo;s idea had to be intended as some kind of comedy. Only the sad state of the white movement, and the untethered insanity of this anti-white sentiment that&rsquo;s everywhere, can explain why it&rsquo;s not comedy. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s with this &#8216;exploitation&rsquo;? That&rsquo;s called having a job. No wonder no one wants to work in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t a deal can be made where native Hawaiians can celebrate the diversity, not to mention the progress, whites have given them, while whites allow portions of Hawaii to be governed by native Hawaiians? </p>

		<p>I researched moving to Hawaii once and found a lot of stuff on the web stating similar points that this article does.  Surprisingly, many of the comments were from White teachers who accepted jobs there and wound up leaving in disgust.  I&rsquo;ve never been there, but I picture it as living on an Indian reservation in the middle of an ocean.  As usual, the mainstream media makes no mention of the racial conflicts in that so-called &#8220;paradise&#8221;.  Why would any logical person assume the natives would be friendly towards a race who &#8220;stole&#8221; their land?  </p>

		<p>Since these hate crimes are almost entirely directed against whites by the non-white natives, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that the feds will bother to get involved at all. After all, the victims are only white people. Why should a federal government establishment with so many spiteful elites give a damn?</p>
<p>Ms. Haunani-Kay Trask, the native-Hawaiian professor said, &#8220;Just as&hellip;all exploited peoples are justified in feeling hostile and resentful toward those who exploit them, so we Hawaiians are justified in such feelings toward the haole [whites]. This is the legacy of racism, of colonialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, Ms. Trask. It is the legacy of the hatred toward the Majority white society that developed along with the Civil Rights movement and other minority rights movements in the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s, encouraged by a Culture of Critique that only saw rights as a thing for minorities, and saw the white majority society as evil and racist. It is a culture of spite, and your ugly resentments flower from that spite. </p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s more akin to American Indians&rdquo; because Hawaiians had their homeland invaded, were exposed to diseases for which they had no immunity, and had an alien culture forced upon them, he says.&#8221;</p>
<p>How about just giving those parts of Hawaii inhabited by original Hawaiins back to them and Whites leave and take their achievements with them?</p>

		<p>These kinds of things could never happen in Hawaii or any place else if the whites would unify into militias, each member having a cell phone.  A pre-determined code word, with the address of a an attack or possible attack, could be entered into a victim&rsquo;s cell phone, sendng the message to everybody in his militia.  It would be agreed beforehand that the situation would be so crucial that every member would be required to DROP what he was doing and head for the scene immediately.</p>
<p>Meetings about once per month would have to be held to discuss attitudes, intimidations, and attacks, along with any news pertinent to whites in general.  Addresses and phone numbers&hellip;photos also, if possible&hellip;could be exchanged in order to keep current on who the trouble-makers might be.  In fact, it could be an event held at a steakhouse or lounge, so that it could also be a night of recreation.  </p>
<p>Once it was known that whites were fighting back, there would not only be a curtailment in white attacks, the police wouldn&rsquo;t dare refuse to prosecute an attack on a white for fear of whites becoming more militant and more inclined to handle the matter themselves.</p>
<p>The same thing is true of the situation here.  If whites united into defensive militia groups and fought back against any attacks on them, we would see white attacks reduced to an insignificant level.</p>
<p>These blacks and Hawaiians are cowards, and it incites their bloodlust to prey on people who aren&rsquo;t inclined to defend themselves.  </p>
<p>The bottom line is that the solution is simple:  All whites have to do is unify and fight back and no one would dare confront them.</p>

		<p>I agree with Luke. Thank God we outnumber our Native Americans or we&rsquo;d be getting our butts kicked by them, too. It was a bad move for Europeans to conquer technologically primitive tribes all over the world. They hate and resent us now, no doubt fueled by seething jealousy. When tribal people meet Western Civilization head on, the tribes get a good dose of seeing themselves the way they really are: primitive and unaccomplished. This is why they hate us. They see what we have and what we&rsquo;ve done, and know that they were never a part of it. You think they&rsquo;d be happy riding on our coattails, but no. Whites have brought a lot of good to tribal people, but they don&rsquo;t see it that way. There&rsquo;s no reasoning with blind jealousy. We should abandon Hawaii, blow up our infrastructure,  and let them revert back to the way they were before the coming of Europeans: cannibalism and human sacrifice in paradise.  </p>

		<p><i>The resentment some Native Hawaiians feels toward whites today can be chalked up in part to &ldquo;ancestral memory,&rdquo; says Jon Matsuoka, dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Hawaii. </i> </p>
<p>Yes, &ldquo;ancestral memory,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s it! it has absolutely nothing to do with the vicious anti-white venom spewed by the good Mr. Matsuoka. Long dead ancestors can indeed impart their memories onto the living, don&rsquo;t you know. It&rsquo;s an ancient Hawaiian religious belief, something whites with their science and their silly logic wouldn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

		<p>So&hellip;Hawaii&rsquo;s best kept secret is no longer secret, eh? My story begins ll years ago when I &#8220;dropped in&#8221; while returning home to Canada from New Zealand. I spent a total of seven weeks backpacking and slow crawling around Hawaii by bicycle. The weather and pleasant temperatures were superb, but I sensed a certain &#8220;coolness&#8221; among the ordinary Hawaiian natives themselves.</p>
<p>I knew there had to be a white racial slur, so just out of curiosity, I ask a young Hawaiian woman what it might be. She answered rather reluctantly&hellip; &#8220;haole&#8221;. Having never heard the word before, I had to ask her to spell it out. It meant nothing to me at the time, and still doesn&rsquo;t to this day.</p>
<p>My one and only overt display of racism occurred when dismantling my tent one morning in one of their many designated camp grounds. A Hawaiian park employee attempted to prematurely hustle me off the grounds before the stated departure time on my permit. He became surly, arrogant and bombastic all within a few minutes of approaching me. He referred to my &#8220;mainlander&#8221; status with disgust, whereas I corrected him to inform him of my Canadian citizenship&hellip;not American. That information only increased his surliness. </p>
<p>Anyhow, I wrote a letter of complaint to the Parks &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;, with copy to the mayor of Honolulu. I did receive a letter of apology and was informed that the parks employee/volunteer had been fired, but this white &#8220;haole&#8221; has no inclination to visit Hawaii again. </p>

		<p>A lot of people seem to think that whites leaving Hawaii and the US letting it become it&rsquo;s own nation would solves things, why is this?</p>
<p>Blacks in Africa continue to blame whites for all their problems, even after they&rsquo;ve killed them all - such as the case with Zimbabwe.  Mugabe killed all the whites in his country, so now he blames the whites in the UK for his country&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>What makes you think natives of Hawaii would be any different?  They have the same inferiority complex that blacks have.  </p>
<p>However, none of this is any excuse for white cowardice in our own country.  I&rsquo;m sorry, but the last time I checked guns were legal and so was self-defense.  Teach your female relatives, your children(and heck, even your male relatives too) how to handle firearms.  Guns, they solve almost everything.</p>

Again, it is amazing how these incidents like the &#8220;road rage&#8221; incident are reported. One vehicle dented another in a parking lot, NOT on the &#8220;road&#8221;. The white woman was attacked by the sixteen year old thug and her husband struck in the throat with a &#8220;kill shot&#8221; martial arts move by the thug like father. Then the white woman was beaten for fifteen minutes and thrown under the SUV by the two thugs, ALL THIS OCCURRING WHILE THE THREE YEAR CHILD OF THE WHITE COUPLE LOOKED ON!! This was nothing less than attempted murder!! The son got juvenile detention and the father got two years in prison. All this for a parking lot dent in a car!!</p>

		<p>This Kamehameha the natives call &#8220;king&#8221; only became so by waging a brutal war of aggression against the other islanders. Became &#8220;king&#8221; only by using the white mans weapons and using them ruthlessly. His trademark was outright butchery and extermination of anyone that opposed him. His closest advisers were several English sailors that had gone &#8220;native&#8221; and taught the locals how to use cannon and muskets. There were some things of the white man that Kamehameha found to be useful. Reading, writing, and rithymetic&rsquo; were not among those things.</p>

<p>I agree.  Ugly as such racial confrontations are, when people are forced together by circumstances, this is a natural reaction to invasion by another tribe or race.   It could be avoided by avoiding Diversity or by keeping it to a minimum.</p>
<p>Hawaiians are reacting in a perfectly normal way to the &#8220;Diversity&#8221; that whites have brought them.  Clearly, THEY DON&rsquo;T WANT IT!   They don&rsquo;t like it any more than we do.  But we are the ones who are not acting normally by accepting something that is so contrary to our own best interests in our own  homelands.    At least Hawaiians know better.  While we lie down and accept Diversity (because we&rsquo;re told it&rsquo;s good for us),   the Hawaiians don&rsquo;t.   We could learn something from them.</p>

		<p>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, Hawaii what can I say?  This is a topic  very near and dear to me, seeing as I lived there all through my jr. and high school years.  </p>
<p>I moved to the big island in the late 70s from south central LA.  Being a newly arrived foreigner and naive to the actual conditions in HI. I though I would experience the &#8220;the aloha spirit&#8221; possibly even be met by a woman with a fresh flower lei.  What  actually happened blew my mind.  I found out that not only were Hawaiians more prejudiced than the other delightful minorities I encountered in S. Central, but they liked to fight in packs, and it didn&rsquo;t matter if you were a skinny twelve year old, you were considered fair game for any 17,18,19,20 year old out there who had a bug up his rear end  and not only that, but the cowards couldn&rsquo;t fight you one on one.</p>
<p>To all the people who want to leave HI. to all the mixed breed, wanna be natives, I ask you, do we give up California next?  Maybe AZ.?, how about TX?  All the indigenous people in those states have valid claims.  Do we pack up and go?  </p>
<p>My theory is that all land belonged to one group or another at some time and the reason that any particular group no longer has that land is because they were weaker than the invading host.  That&rsquo;s true as much today as it&rsquo;s ever been.  So, who is the strongest now?  </p>
<p>The problem with white people today is that they are incredibly apathetic and nature abhors a vacuum, so people who aren&rsquo;t as apathetic naturally move in and take over.  I think Hawaii has a lot of potential, was at one time a very livable and enjoyable place prior to the radicalization and the fomenting of racial hatred towards whites and western civilization in general during the 60s.  Our people fought and died on it&rsquo;s soil and if anyone should have a piece of paradise it should be our people.  So, for those reasons among others, I do not advocate giving anything to anyone.  I say if they want it, they&rsquo;re gonna have to take it and if they prevail, then they deserve it.      </p>

		<p>Hawaii is full of non-Hawaiian Asians. Yet only whites are called &#8220;haoles&#8221; (literally: &#8220;foreigners&#8221;). Even the utterly lame excuse that these attacks stem from historical grievances is a lie because the violent haters are so often not Hawaiians, such as the Samoans mentioned. This story adds up to more excuses for savage violence against innocent whites. </p>
<p>To read, &#8220;Students who did complain were retaliated against by their antagonists. &#8216;They learned not to report this stuff,&rsquo; Mohr says of her own daughters,&#8221; is outrageous. Imagine the uproar if anyone of any other race in the USA suffered such widespread, brutal oppression, daily. </p>
<p>And from this hateful cauldren, boiling away in the tropical heat, rose our new, anti-white president. No wonder they won&rsquo;t release his birth certificate.</p>
<p>I hope Hawaii regains its independence. Maybe it will stir the cognition among whites that we too are entitled to our own homelands. Pray that our people wake up soon!</p>

<p>2) White residents can clear out, and we can ship the black prison population to Hawaii, saving us money and foisting whitey&rsquo;s problem on the Hawaians, for whom whites suddenly won&rsquo;t seem so bad anymore.</p>

		<p>My family lived in Hilo (Big Island)  for seven LONG years (nose-diving economy/illness sucked us dry and we had a hard time  saving  enough  money to move back  to the mainland where we belonged) and we know  well  the anti-White bias of the Locals. (Trying to get a job while White in Hilo despite extensive qualifications can be a MAJOR struggle). All  of the various  ethnicites have anti-White bias, though the Japanese especially tend to  use more passive-aggressive means instead of the regular &#8220;stink eye&#8221;  or  worse.Yes Hawaii&rsquo;s a beautiful place, but I agree it should  never  have been made a state UNLESS only Whites were  allowed to live there. As that  won&rsquo;t happen, I&rsquo;m instead all for destroying  the Western Civilization infrastructure there, including roads/bridges, and pulling out all  Whites and letting &#8220;them&#8221; have the whole state. It will  then be quickly swallowed up by the Red Chinese and the  Mainland Japanese  can fight for the  crumbs. </p>

While the splc tries to contort and hide the facts about racial attacks against whites, some attacks are too blatant, to egregious to ignore.</p>
<p>The splc is throwing whites a bone only because this issue is too overwhelming to cover up.</p>

		<p>You would be hard pressed to find a state in America that is more racist than Hawaii.  Locals absolutely hate white people.</p>
<p>I have an ultra-liberal friend that moved to Hawaii about 4 years ago.  He has told me several times that he has experience an incredibly high amount of racism from the local people; resulting in physical violence on more than one occasion. </p>
<p>There was a large contingent of Hawaiians at the University I attended and they were notoriously violent and racist.  I would say they probably hate whitey more than any other racial group.<br>

  &#8220;Read some pre-PC US history soon, before all the books are destoyed by the commies! You&rsquo;ll only find these books now in libraries in sleepy towns, or maybe on your grandparents&rsquo; bookshelves.&#8221;</p>

Excellent idea.  Our history is being erased and re-written.  If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have them, hang on to them, they will become precious.  And I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it could eventually  be made illegal in another generation or two to own them, considering the way things are going.</p>

<p>Thanks for the trip down memory lane. <i>Hawaii Five-O</i> was my favorite TV show growing up, and it was filmed entirely on location. IMHO the theme song still stands as the best of all time. McGarrett &amp; Co. definitely would have done whatever it took to maintain law &amp; order, even if it meant saying &#8220;Book &#8216;em, Dan-o&#8221; a hundred times a day.</p>
<p>I read recently that the SPLC lost a bundle in the Bernie Madoff pyramid scheme. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re expanding their horizon a bit here   &mdash;   gotta get more loot from the sheeple. </p>
<p>Responding to GBJ (#50): When it comes to secession and the breakup of the US, I&rsquo;m dead serious. I calculate we&rsquo;re about where the Soviet Union was in 1989 or 1990. Dozens of states have enacted 10th Amendment resolutions, several others are looking to nullify federal regulation of intrastate commerce in guns &amp; ammo, Congresscritters have become terrified of their constituents. Any one of at least a dozen incidents could trigger the final collapse, and we likely won&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s happened until after the fact. </p>

		<p>The odd thing is that Native Hawaiians seem not to hate the Japanese and Chinese settlers/immigrants in Hawaii, despite the gloringly obvious fact that the Japanese, in particular, control politics and own most of the genuinely profitable businesses in the islands.</p>
<p>If white overlordship ended, the Native Hawaiians would find themselves with far sterner masters; Japanese-Americans born in Hawaii - several generations now - have nothing but the most profound contempt for low-IQ Native Hawaiians but are normally VERY good at concealing the fact.</p>

There won&rsquo;t be ANY welfare then. No free handouts. They&rsquo;ll have the option to work in the Chinese-run factories and plantations, for long hours at slave wages&hellip; or get nothing at all. <br>

		<p>I found an old Newspaper clipping in a book, called &#8220;Protege&#8221; by Malcolm MacPherson. I highly recommend this book. </p>
<p>Now, the Newspaper clip that I had saved, and obviously used as a book mark, is dated Wednesday, September 24, 1986. On page two of the Newspaper was a Headline which says, &#8220;Nakasone Remark Raises Eyebrows&#8221;. The remark was as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Japanese Newspapers quoted Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, yestersay, as saying that the U.S. intelligence level is lower than Japan&rsquo;s because of all the Blacks, Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>We could probably add Native Hawaiians to that core group, as well. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love it, when a Politician, from another Country, and even another Race, puts his finger on the obvious problem of the United States? I knew that I kept this News clip for a reason. </p>
<p>And, definately buy the book. <br>

		<p>Double C:  The Japanese have a history of telling the truth about blacks.  I think it&rsquo;s because Japanese business executives have been victims of violent crime when they travel on business to the U.S., and you don&rsquo;t need to guess at whose hands.  Note their strategic placing of car factories in rural areas, that communicates a message like no other.</p>

		<p>Has anyone seen a U of Hawaii football game at Aloha Stadium recently? Nothing but thugs, smack talk, and fist-fighting for the visiting team. And the crowd eggs them on and is just salivating to join in. Every time I see Hawaii&rsquo;s football team get their butts stomped I get happy.</p>

		<p>Thank you for posting this. I was unfamiliar with the extent of anti-white bigotry in Hawaii. That, incidentally, is a harbinger of the future condition of all whites in America, and eventually throughout the planet - which is why the racialist cause is a HOLY cause. Don&rsquo;t let some liberal masquerading as a Christian tell you different!</p>
<p>That said, Hawaii is lost. Given that it is majority-minority, divesting our nation of this racial eyesore (along with the even worse Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa) is vital to our long-term racial security. Agree? Perhaps we should begin writing our representatives to this effect.</p>

		<p>I remember being asked to work building a house on Maui, some many years ago. The person asking me was in a bind, a friend and said that he was having problems getting workers to work and the project completed. Well when I stepped off the plane one of the carpenters met me and we had lunch in a small town on the way to Hana. I soon found that work is a much avoided concept, at least on Maui, so this why I was asked to build the home. After about three weeks into the project the carpenter that drove me to the job, said he was going to the small town and have a beer and shoot some pool. So, I said sounds like a good idea let me come with you&hellip;to my surprise, he said that when he was eating and playing pool with the locals, they told him that I was too haole and told him that I cannot come back to the small town. The reason that the carpenter was able to go and get along with the locals is because he is of Mediterranian heritage and it seems that my blond hair, and blue eyes are the mark of the haole. Also, I was told not to go off the property after dark in Hana, as it was not safe. After 45 days of work and isolation I left that place never to return.</p>

		<p>I am surprised at all the comments saying, give up Hawaii.  All they can think of in any situation is retreat.  Just elect one decent president, and we can overturn the bulwark, and that is, the basic communism.  How is it possible that in the U.S.A., it is illegal to own land?</p>
<p>Once the communist system there is overturned, we can move in about 3 to 5 million white American retirees, and they will control the place.  They will vote in the police forces to protect white people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so hard.  Stop thinking only in terms of retreat.  Instead of giving it back to those morons, we can make it ours.</p>
