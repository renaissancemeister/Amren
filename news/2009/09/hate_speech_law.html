<h1><a href="https://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=1954734">Hate Speech Law Unconstitutional: Rights Tribunal</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Brean, National Post (Toronto), September 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has ruled that Section 13, Canada&rsquo;s much maligned human rights hate speech law, is an unconstitutional violation of the Charter right to free expression because of its penalty provisions.</p>
<p>The decision released this morning by Tribunal chair Athanasios Hadjis appears to strip the Canadian Human Rights Commission of its controversial legal mandate to pursue hate on the Internet, which it has strenuously defended against complaints of censorship.</p>
<p>It also marks the first major failure of Section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, an anti-hate law that was conceived in the 1960s to target racist telephone hotlines, then expanded in 2001 to the include the entire Internet, and for the last decade used almost exclusively by one complainant, activist Ottawa lawyer Richard Warman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s shocking decision is a victory over Mr. Warman by Marc Lemire, webmaster of freedomsite.org and a prominent figure in the Canadian far right, who was supported in his constitutional challenge of Section 13 by the legal team defended Holocaust denier Ernst Zundel.</p>
<p>Mr. Warman alleged that postings on Mr. Lemire&rsquo;s website, written by others, contravened Section 13 in that they were &#8220;likely to expose&#8221; identifiable groups to &#8220;hatred or contempt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Lemire responded by challenging the law itself, which was last upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in a 1990 split decision, before the Internet age.</p>
<p>That decision, about neo-Nazi John Ross Taylor, upheld the law as a justifiable limit on free expression largely because of its supposedly remedial, non-punitive purpose. But Mr. Hadjis found that that, today, the pursuit of Section 13(1) cases &#8220;can no longer be considered exclusively remedial, preventative and conciliatory in nature.&#8221; Rather, the law &#8220;has become more penal in nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cited Mr. Warman&rsquo;s request for a $7500 penalty against Mr. Lemire. Mr. Warman has won over a dozen other Section 13(1) cases, many leading to similar fines as well as legal restrictions on Internet activity.</p>
<p>This criticism about a penal law masquerading as a remedial one echoes that of Richard Moon, a law professor hired by the CHRC last year to provide an expert analysis of their online hate speech mandate. In essence, his advice was that it could not be done fairly, and so should not be done at all.</p>
<p>Mr. Hadjis&rsquo; decision to reject the law as unconstitutional, in light of its penalty provisions, leaves a central area Canada&rsquo;s human rights in limbo, and kicks a political hot potato over to the government and the Canadian Human Rights Commission, which can appeal the ruling to Federal Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Warman&rsquo;s case was supported by the CHRC, and various advocacy groups joined the case as intervenors in support of Section 13.</p>
<p>Mr. Hadjis rejected Mr. Warman&rsquo;s complaints in all but one instance, an article called AIDS Secrets. He found that this posting contravened Section 13(1). But he also found the law itself  &mdash;  with its threat of penalties such as an order to cease the discrimatory messages, or pay fines up to $10,000  &mdash;  violates Mr. Lemire&rsquo;s Charter right to freedom of expression, and therefore refused to make any order against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since a formal declaration of invalidity [of Section 13(1)] is not a remedy available to the Tribunal, I will simply refuse to apply these provisions for the purposes of the complaint against Mr. Lemire and I will not issue any remedial order against him,&#8221; Mr. Hadjis wrote.<br>

		<p>The irony is that virtually all of Canada&rsquo;s neo-Nazi activity is done at the hands of the same leftist ideological ilk that Richard Warman belongs to.  If the &#8220;far rightist&#8221; mentioned here led to the nullification of Canada&rsquo;s shut-up-the-right-wing law (though this isn&rsquo;t a Supreme Court reversal), the irony is so delicious.</p>

		<p>Whoa! Canada gets lucky again. A judge who (judging from his name) is either 1) a Copt or 2) a Greek whose family was expelled from Turkey would have little sympathy for the race racketeers.</p>

		<p>oh my! this is certainly sobering.  i have always believed these so-called &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; laws were way unconstitutional mainly because justice is supposed to be blind - color blind, sexual identity-blind and so forth.  and exactly WHO is supposed to decide what crimes are &#8216;hate&rsquo; and which are not?  justice sotomayor?  it is not legal at best and is Certainly NOT constitutional</p>

		<p>First the asylum for an Afrikaner, now this. That&rsquo;s two good decisions in a row in Canada.</p>
<p>In the original article the slimy ADL is quoted attacking this ruling. IIRC when B&rsquo;nai Brith sends out fundraising letters in the US they never mention that their organization supports censorhip around the globe. </p>

		<p>Most ordinary Canadians can&rsquo;t understand this legal mumbo jumbo. A week from now they won&rsquo;t be able to remember that a decision was made at all assuming they even read this newspaper. There was no mention made of this decision in the TV news today. Canadians will continue to play it safe and not say anything at all. If the Canadian regime wanted to give citizens examples of proper speach and ways to affect political change they could easily have done so by now. The overall national message is clear - Canadians are to meekly accept growing diversity and the negative consequences for whites. </p>

<p>Wasn&rsquo;t some outburst of supremacist hate traced back to Richard Warman&rsquo;s own IP address, or was it another prominent leftist in Canada? </p>

		<p>Canada&rsquo;s so-called Hate Speech Protection is basically a legal sword aimed at cutting down anyone who dares to oppose any self-righteous, self-appointed expert of color (and we have thousands).  It&rsquo;s good to see this one-sided rule being struck down   &mdash;   <b>perhaps this is a sign that Canadians are tired of having to defend themselves <i>in a country that they themselves built. </i></b></p>

		<p>There have been huge changes in Canada since the government began censoring free speech. It&rsquo;s not reasonable to now say &#8220;oops we made a mistake and let&rsquo;s move forward&#8221;. I believe Canada would not have gone so far down this road of diversity and immigration if there had been free speech. We should have a truth and reconciliation commission to help Canada manage all the damage that has been done.  </p>

		<p>This is a sober and rational decision. Either statements are true or false, if false and injurious the perpetrator is libal to slander laws. Concerning who or what a person loves or hates is none of the governments jurisdiction. Freedom and Liberty were hard won and are easily lost as the primitive aspects of nature are always ready to reclaim what is more cultivated. Being white and its implications is not accidental nor is the liberty and reason loving culture born of it.</p>

		<p>I saw Mr.(Free Speech)Alan Dershowitz on C-Span Booknotes awhile back (promoting one of his books)when asked about free speech rights he said &#8220;someone like Pat Buchanan has the right to speak on a street corner,but doesn&rsquo;t have the right to speak on national television&#8221;. In other words Pat has the right to speak,only if he is not allowed to persuade millions.Dershowitz of course believes that he should have unlimited coverage and access to television.He can lament the decline of his people and faith,but rejoice in the decline and destruction of straight white christian culture.This is so typical of the 60&rsquo;s hippies,who now control the media.</p>

		<p>As the descendant of Quebecois, perhaps I can soon get assylum as an American who wishes to return to the Canada of my great, grandfather?</p>
<p>If this sort of legislation becomes common, Canada may become a better place for whites than the U.S.</p>

		<p>I just spent a little bit of time perusing the freedomsite.org website and its blog.  It was blocked from where I work as a site promoting &#8220;hate, racism, or violence&#8221;.  So I had to wait until I got home to get my dose of &#8220;hate, racism, or violence&#8221;, and who, knows, if I&rsquo;m really lucky, maybe some scantily clad women as well.  Well, damn, what a disappointment!  While there may be some &#8220;racist&#8221; article or comment somewhere on that site, pretty much all I can find is criticism of the Stalinist Canadian Human Rights Commission and its oppressive and capricious actions.  (An excellent example of the latter   &mdash;   Reverend Stephen Boissoin was placed under a lifetime speech ban merely for objecting to gay marriage, but when an Islamic Iman named named Abou Hammaad Sulaiman Dameus Al-Hayiti wrote, &#8220;Homosexuals and lesbians should be exterminated in this life&#8221; the CHRC did nothing, saying that no law was violated.)</p>
<p>So apparently the &#8220;hate&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221; of freedomsite.org consists of hating the CHRC, which any proponent of free speech should.</p>
