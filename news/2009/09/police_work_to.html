<h1>Police Work to Improve Hispanic Relations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Trace Christianson, Battle Creek Enquirer, Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Felipe Lugo said he hasn&rsquo;t had problems with police in the Battle Creek area.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no problems that I am aware of,&#8221; the 37-year-old Battle Creek man said Tuesday.</p>
<p>He was one of the first to arrive for &#8220;Know Your Rights,&#8221; a program designed for the Hispanic community, conducted in Spanish and sponsored by the Latino/Hispanic Community Project.</p>
<p>And while Lugo, who said he speaks limited English, said he has not heard about a problem between Hispanics and police officers, he would seem to represent a minority.</p>
<p>A recent Battle Creek area survey shows 64 percent of Hispanics do not believe police treat them with respect and 77 percent believe the police will ask them for immigration papers even during routine traffic stops.</p>
<p>The meeting at Burnham Brook was designed not only to explain rights, but is one effort to educate and improve the relationship between police and the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The community is scared to make a complaint,&#8221; said Kate Kennedy, project director of the Latino/Hispanic Community Project, funded by the Battle Creek Community Foundation. &#8220;That is the perception of the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The survey of 197 Hispanics living in the greater Battle Creek area was conducted between June and December 2008 by The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University. The results were released in February.</p>
<p>Kennedy, whose nonprofit organization is designed to assist Hispanics obtain community resources, such as health care, employment, education and law enforcement services, said the results represented perceptions of those surveyed, even though no hard data exists on actual discrimination or inferior treatment by police.</p>
<p>And Deputy Chief Jackie Hampton of the Battle Creek Police Department said his officers don&rsquo;t ask about immigration status unless the person is arrested, &#8220;and then we have no control of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hampton said the department has tried to respond to the growing number of Hispanics and Latino residents in the city, with is now estimated at about 5 percent of the population, or 3,000 people.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the population has increased, we have become more aware of their needs and sensitive to their concerns,&#8221; Hampton said. &#8220;We are trying to represent the entire population of Battle Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kennedy said her agency still must collect data, trying to determine any actual incidents of profiling, checks of immigration status, and even an estimate of how many illegal immigrants and bilingual residents are living in the metropolitan area.</p>
<p>&#8220;But tonight the main goal is to talk to people and have a comfortable atmosphere,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are educating them about their rights and giving them practical examples about what to do.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m damn proud of the people of Michigan who, despite the high unemployment, the high crime rate, the collapsed auto industry, etc., are willing to share their state with poor people from Mexico and the rest of the world.  Their courage is exceeded only by their intelligence.</p>

		<p>Another sob story about illegals and how they are &#8220;entitled&#8221; to our social service goodies, and afraid to go to the police (I wonder why?)</p>
<p>Gag me, please!</p>

		<p>It must have been an absolute disappointment to put an event like this together hoping to find a large constituency of victims to represent only to find actual working class hispanic americans who had nothing better to do on a weekday. Not one single victim in the whole group! Sure beats going out to dinner and a movie in this economy. I bet everyone had a fantastic night. Everyone except the liberals footing the bill. I&rsquo;m picturing dreams of boo&rsquo;s and hisses for the police crushed by applause and respect. I know everyone&rsquo;s just scared to speak out against all the injustice. I hereby encourage all normal working class hispanic americans to show up to these sort of events, speak your native language, network, meet new friends, maybe even meet a significant other, and eat the budget of the promoters until they have to have a cover charge. At that point, have your own events without the liberals. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;As the population has increased, we have become more aware of their needs and sensitive to their concerns,&rdquo; </p>
<p>If they upheld the law as they are sworn to do how many needs and concerns go beyond a forced bus ride to the border?</p>

<p>The only Law Enforcement Services they should need is assistance in deportation paperwork.</p>

		<p>Living in Michigan i can tell you the welfare system is so easy to obtain that we are getting them from all over the country even though there is no work. Now all these clowns are walking around and bragging about the Obama phone everyone of them gets. Free phones for all. The crime rate has risen and the governor is wanting to bring in more mexican gang members from California to house in the prisons here besides the terrorists of Gitmo. Its bad here. </p>
