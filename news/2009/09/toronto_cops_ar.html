<h1><a href="https://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2009/09/15/10908151-sun.html">Toronto Cops Are Winning on Race</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Antonella Artuso, Toronto Sun, September 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One in five Toronto police officers is a member of a racial minority  &mdash;  a near doubling in under a decade, according to police employment statistics.</p>
<p>Mark Pugash, a spokesman for Toronto Police Services, said yesterday the numbers reflect a concerted effort over the last decade to welcome new people into the service.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s about ensuring that the service is more reflective of the city that we serve,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We know that there&rsquo;s a long way to go but what is important, I think, is that the numbers are moving very much in the right direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the 5,500 police officers in the city, 18.6% or 1,068 members are representatives of racial minorities, up from 16.9% in 2007 and 9.5% in 2000.</p>
<p>Almost 22% of police constables hail from minority communities.</p>
<p>30 YEARS</p>
<p>The percentage of racial minorities in the service&rsquo;s civilian arm is even higher  &mdash;  32.2%  &mdash;  because the staff tends to turn over more quickly than in the rest of the service, Pugash said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once people join as police officers, they tend to spend a minimum of 30 years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Women are 17.5% of the force, an increase of about 5% since the year 2000.</p>
<p>Female officers make up 18.2% of the detectives and 14.1% of senior brass.</p>
<p>Currently, women head up the homicide, fraud and sex assault units.</p>
<p>There are only 63 officers, or 1.1% of the service, of aboriginal background, but none hold a rank higher than sergeant. But Pugash said the service is constantly reaching out to aboriginals, women, racial groups and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered communities.</p>
<p>While these people are still under-represented, employment figures show definite improvement with every new class of recruits, Pugash said.<br>

		<p>Toronto looks like the multicultural paradise that was dreamed by liberals for a long time and voila it is there.</p>
<p>Almost all anglo saxon countries are looking more and more like South Africa and the rainbow nation.</p>
<p>We are definitely on our way out of history.<br>

		<p>This anti-white story should be headlined &#8220;White Canadians Need Not Apply&#8221; as the multi-cults seem intent trumping with their race card when hiring and destroy any notion of merit-based qualifications.  </p>
<p>To make their point, the Toronto Police Board just promoted the 2nd of <a href="https://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2009/09/14/10884126-sun.html" rel="nofollow"><b>two black immigrants</b></a> that now hold the prestigious title of Deputy Chief. This latest affirmative action shoe-in is probably being groomed to become Toronto&rsquo;s first black police chief in the near future, so all potential white police candidates can be rest assured their opportunity for the top job has just been squashed with this latest development. </p>
<p>Canadian police forces are not likely to learn anything from their U.S. counterparts when race-based hiring practices takes precedence over their once high standards. When your race becomes your primary qualification then we know we&rsquo;re on a slippery downward path to less than mediocrity as explained in <a href="https://elliotlakenews.wordpress.com/2007/09/17/destroying-effective-policing/" rel="nofollow">this short essay</a>.    </p>

A recent Toronto Most Wanted list includes just one (1) visible white male who has been missing for almost 27 years. He is nearing 70, likely deceased and was probably included simply to relieve the otherwise unremitting darkness.</p>

		<p>It goes without saying that many of these minority officers are there because of affirmative action policies that almost certainly hired them ahead of better qualified Whites. Somebody ought to start a lawsuit over it up there in Canada, or don&rsquo;t they have anti-discrimination laws??</p>

		<p>The Toronto police, and firemen too, don&rsquo;t have the huge controversies about quotas and race norming that we hear about in the US. Maybe because the Canadian constitution does allow for affirmative action by race. Or maybe the forces don&rsquo;t rely on a single aptitude test to rank applicants. Either way we&rsquo;re left wondering if whites are being unfairly screened out to achieve this &#8220;improvement&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Toronto Cops Are Winning on Race?&#8221; Fascinating. And just what will the situation be when they have finally &#8220;won?&#8221; Exact mathematical parity with the percentage of each racial group in society? Or far more non-whites than whites in order to make up for past &#8220;injustices?&#8221; What will be the exact formula used? And once the formula is decided upon, how will it be achieved? Will police appointments be made by bureaucratic bean counters rather than by a seasoned police board based on recruit test scores? And in the meantime, while the police are preoccupied about &#8220;winnin&#8221; on race,&#8221; what about winning the fight against, well, crime? Just exactly how does the Toronto crime rate compare, based on population,  with the crime rate in say, 1950?</p>

		<p>The Cops are winning!  Winning what?  Will the city be safer because lesser qualified police are hired and promoted?  Look at the scandals over the decades that occurred when police departments hired more minorities, many of whom had criminal backgrounds, criminal connections, or who were less able to write police reports so that convictions could result.<br>
 Perhaps in a few years, Toronto will be as safe as Detroit.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  HM</p>

		<p>Though I am not pleased, I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m surprised. When are whites in Western nations finally going to realize that it is not wise to empower those they have previously oppressed? The way self-hating and treacherous whites go out of their way to provide aid to blacks and other coloreds is suicidal. A good metaphor would be the strong and vicious bully in high school who provides combat training and steroids to the kids he previously abused. Without question, the kids previously harmed by the bully are eventually going to exact revenge upon him. Therefore, as whites, since our numbers are declining and we continue to lose influence, we can ill afford to relinquish our power just to placate angry coloreds.</p>

		<p>The formerly 98% White city of Toronto (now reduced to 57%) was once trumpeted as  being &#8220;Toronto the Good&#8221; because of low crime rates and clean streets&hellip;until masses of 3rd world foreign strangers began relieving us of our stable homogeneity in the 1970s. </p>
<p>A legacy of black slavery doesn&rsquo;t exist in Canada, yet White Canadians are forced to take a back seat in our own country by relinquishing job opportunities and promotions to foreign minorities. </p>
<p>Taken from the above link &#8220;two black immigrants&#8221;, <a href="https://www.torontopolice.on.ca/command.php" rel="nofollow">Black deputy chief Forde</a> is quoted as saying <b>&#8220;I think we will see a black police chief in this city. I am very pleased with the direction this command is going.&#8221;</b> &#8220;This city&#8221; is not located in his birth country of Barbados, but the Canadian city of Toronto, which he cleverly avoids using by name.</p>
<p>Imagine a white senior officer expressing similar thoughts favouring a white police chief in Canada&rsquo;s largest city. He should be called &#8220;on the carpet&#8221; for such biased statements, as uttered by this high ranking black officer in command of thousands of police officers who are mostly white.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this employment-equity hire won&rsquo;t be chastised because he&rsquo;d pull out the old race card himself, so the white cowards who outrank him back off and crawl back to their desks muttering something about political-correct procedures.  </p>
<p>This black deputy chief&rsquo;s racial preferences have reached beyond leveling the playing field for minorities, to one of declaring the ultimate power grab for the whole field. Unless docile and brainwashed White Canadians begin to act in their own best interests in the same manner as these minorities do, we&rsquo;ll soon find ourselves inhabiting the basement of our own home. </p>
<p>Their Black police association (link below) declare themselves as &#8220;Leaders for the Future&#8221;. Thanks, but we&rsquo;ve already got capable leaders and judging how African and Caribbean countries manage themselves, our future under your leadership would be a disaster. </p>
<p>South Africa and Zimbabwe anyone??</p>

<p>It is not open to membership except to blacks and other minorities.</p>
<p>Whites are specifically excluded.</p>
<p>Why is nobody taking this group to court to force them to accept whites.</p>
<p>Another double standard.</p>
<p>The new deputy chief is a black named Sloly replacing a white women that resigned.  Wonder why she resigned.</p>
<p>Toronto is a third world he$$ hole sad to say but true.</p>

		<p>Toronto is not &#8220;winning&#8221; anything. Non-White foreigners are getting good jobs, that&rsquo;s all. Toronto is vastly more crime-plagued then when it was an all-White city in the past.</p>

		<p>20%?  When I walk around Toronto, I feel it is more like 30~40%.  The bigger problem is not how many non-white police officers there are in Toronto.  rather, it is how hard they police officers try everything they can to let non-white criminals get away with their crimes simply because the police officers do not want to be labeled as racists.   Most of the time, when a non-white person commits a crime, they are very busy trying to come up with excuses that they cannot do anything.  </p>
