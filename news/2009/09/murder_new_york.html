		<p>It is surprising how few murders are committed on Long Island<br>
after leaving Brooklyn. What beomces evident to the reader is that murder is primarily a African American and Hispanic phenomena inspire of what you see on CSI,Miami or the other ABC, NBC, or CBS crime shows. Unfortunately for the New York Times they could not change the race of the victims and perps as easily as they do on television.</p>

		<p>Blacks and Hispanics account for 90% of the major crimes, and how much of the population?  Blacks in particular:  60% of major crimes but maybe what, 15% at most.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see the population percentages multiplied by those crime rates.</p>

<p>Blacks 61%</p>
<p>Latins 27%</p>

		<p>And I bet those figures showing 7 % of the crimes committed by whitey is incorrect too. Some sort of skewed data by counting a light skinned Puerto Rican as a whitey, etc.</p>
<p>Notice too the clustering. Stay away from those sections of NYC if I were you.</p>
<p>Some areas of NYC, Staten Island, appear to be very safe indeed. Wonder why that is? Hmmmmm!</p>

		<p>The figures are just what one would expect and kudos to the greatly despised New York Times for printing this. Maybe the NYT and other major newspapers will start toning down their leftist rhetoric and/or print more balanced reports in order to combat falling paper sales and to compete with the alternative media. One can always hope. It would do both them and the reading public some good. </p>

		<p> Interesting, isn&rsquo;t it, that wherever blacks or Hispanics live in the greatest numbers   &mdash;   Harlem in northern Manhattan, the South Bronx, central Brooklyn   &mdash;   there, as sure as night follows the day, also are the largest numbers of murders.</p>
<p> Probably the reason that 61 percent of blacks are perpetrators and an identical percentage are victims is that those are the people they have the greatest access to. If they lived closer to large numbers of Whites, rest assured our percentage of their victims would be higher. A good reason for residential segregation, if anyone still needed another one.</p>

		<p>No surprise here. I imagine any large mult-racial city in the world would show similar results. Toronto, Canada, London, England, Paris, France, etc. Always the same. Any area with a large number of blacks is going to have extremely high rates of crime and violence. Look at the crime rates in Jamaica or South Africa.</p>

		<p>I think the 7% white is overstated because some Arabs (and others) are counted as white.  I remember when Staten Island wanted to become its own city several years ago.  Now I know why.  All I remember from the SI secession effort is the lame-brained comments on the part of New York City officials that SI shouldn&rsquo;t secede because people on SI go on Broadway and watch the musical Cats.  Are we to believe that nobody on Long Island, Westchester County, Connecticut or New Jersey goes to Broadway to watch Cats?  Amazingly, some people far form the NYC metro are go to Broadway to watch Cats.</p>

		<p>Figures, but I also would like to see the actaul types of crimes in their percentage.</p>
<p>Population<br>
New York        America<br>
19,490,297	304,059,724</p>
<p>http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36000.html</p>
<p>Demographics/race makeup 2008-2009<br>
        NYC-    LA-     Chicago-New York State-United States<br>
White 	45% 	47% 	   42%   	68% 	 75%<br>
Black 	27% 	11% 	   37% 	        16% 	 12%<br>
Hispanic<br>
(any race)27% 	47% 	    26%      15%         13%<br>
Asian 	  10% 	10% 	    4% 	     6% 	 4%</p>

<p>So Blacks are only 27% of New York City and 16% of the state of New York State, yet the constitute for 61% of the crimes of  New York City alone, not including the entire state, which would make it more. (Mestizo-Indian/Hispanics) constitute for 29% of the crimes of (NYC) while being 27% of (NYC) and 13% of the entire state of New York; of course they try labeling Hispanic as (all races) meaning mixed-race, Mestizo-Indians, and White, which is contradictory, because Hispanics(Spain) are White, so they should be included into the White category. They need to redo this map, and put Hispanic as (Mestizo-Indian or Mestizo Indian Hispanic) or (Mixed-Race). Whites only make up for 7% of the crime of (NYC) while being 45% of (NYC) and 68% of the entire state of New York. </p>
<p>Of the White population of New York, 2000 census</p>
<p># Italian : 8.7%<br>
# Irish : 5.3%<br>
# German : 3.2%<br>
# Russian : 3.0%<br>
# Polish : 2.7%<br>
# English : 1.6%<br>
# Greek : 1.0%</p>
<p>You notice, that (Jews) are not added to the list of population and statistics, which leads me to believe that Jews are being labeled as White in the crime report. </p>
<p>The thing I am tired of is the demeaning insults that these Mestizo-Indians who adopted Fernando Cortez&rsquo;s ethnicity, culture, and dialect by claiming they are (Hispanics). (His) is American abbreviation denoting &#8220;History&#8221; while (ic) means &#8220;to or of&#8221;. In Spain they are not called &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;, but simply &#8220;Spanics/Spaniards/Spanish&#8221;. &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; means &#8220;belonging to or of the History of Spain/Spanish/Spaniards/Spanics&#8221;. That is an insult to our brothers and sisters in Spain, who are equally offended by this.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s much worse than that.  Blacks make up about 13% percent of the total U.S. population.  Black males between the ages of 14-55, the subgroup most likely to engage in violent crime is only 3% of the total U.S. population.  That number can be reduced even further by excluding Black males already in prison or other institutions, those overseas in the military, the law abiding, etc.   So American society is under attack by a very tiny percentage of the population but that small group is totally protected by our Globalist owned Federal government. </p>

		<p>Are we to assume that the NYT is going to regularly publish these murder stats and break them down racially?</p>
<p>I find this a little hard to believe, given their clear reluctance to even acknowledge the overwhelming black and Hispanic contribution to overall violent crime in this country.</p>
<p>AmRen should keep track of this and report whether we&rsquo;re seeing a new-found willingness by the NYT to report on the racial and ethnic breakdown of violent crime in NY City. More likely this was something that slipped by the editors over the long weekend. </p>

		<p>According to bestplaces.net, 26% of New Yorkers are black and 29% &#8220;claim hispanic ancestry&#8221;.  43% are white and 11% are asian.  Ignoring the (minor) racial overlap, this means blacks are 14 times more likely to commit a crime like this in NYC than whites and hispanics are 6 times more likely.  Asians are 1.5 times more likely.</p>

		<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&#8220;As of the 2005-2007 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, White Americans made up 44.1% of New York City&rsquo;s population; of which 35.1% were non-Hispanic whites. Blacks or African Americans made up 25.2% of New York City&rsquo;s population; of which 23.7% were non-Hispanic blacks. American Indians made up 0.4% of the city&rsquo;s population; of which 0.2% were non-Hispanic. Asian Americans made up 11.6% of the city&rsquo;s population; of which 11.5% were non-Hispanic. In addition, Hispanics and Latinos made up 27.4% of New York City&rsquo;s population.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, in all fairness to the Latins, it seems that their homicide rate is only slightly higher than their population percentage. Unless large numbers are being counted as whites obviously. I suspect that they are vastly over-represented in property crimes such as burglary and auto theft. </p>
<p>But for truly horiffic and savage crimes like murder (and rape, I assume) which require psychopathic personalities, the blacks of course take the cake. So, if my math is correct (homicide % divided by population %), then blacks are 242% over-represented in homicides, whites are committing not even 16% of what we should expect, and asians are committing just under 25% of what you&rsquo;d expect. Well, what you&rsquo;d expect if you were a racial egalitarian that is.</p>
<p>So asians are 1.5x more likely than whites to commit homicide, hispanics are 6.7x more likely, and blacks are a whopping 15.3x more likely. </p>

<p>In 92, there were ca 2300 murders (!!!!), and ca 90%+ were committed by blacks, who were 25% of the population.</p>
<p>This means ca 35 homicides per 1000,000 residents, almost what you&rsquo;d expect to find in darkest Africa.</p>

		<p>Yea, recently there was the famous story of a young man killing a Hispanic woman and stuffing her into the ventilation shaft. For all intents and purposes the media passed the perp off as White&hellip; his last name, however, was distinctly Latino, and he was clearly half-Puerto Rican. The other White killers are oftentimes jilted eldery Jewish lovers or in the odd case, that young Aryan man that killed a prostitute to pay of his school funds. That makes one Nordic type off the top of my head that committed murder, out of 8 million people. Wow.</p>

		<p>This goes to show the lameness and irrelevancy  of the NYT and the power of the Internet.  </p>
<p>For years, the leftist media had total control over what news was released, the spin and slant on said news and were able to spin or suppress any statistic they wanted.  </p>
<p>Therefore, for decades, the NYT told us most crime was White-on-Black, Whites are the greatest danger to non-Whites, non-Whites should form powerful groups to combat Whites, if Whites are not controlled they will don sheets and march in the streets and organize a Fourth Reich and that immigrants just want &#8216;a better life&rsquo;  (and not Free White Money).</p>
<p>The Internet has changed all of that.</p>
<p>Statistics such as these have been posted on line for years now and there&rsquo;s nothing the NYT can do about it  &mdash;  except perhaps promote the Fairness Doctrine and demand government control of the Internet.</p>
<p>As for anyone watching CSI or any other fake &#8216;crime dramas&rsquo; on the alphabet networks that reverses the races of the criminals, distorts reality and crime statistics  &mdash;  Cease and Desist! </p>
<p>If you enjoy crime-type shows, Forensic Files or any of the crime shows on Investigation Discovery are much better  &mdash;  funny how all the REAL forensic scientists and crime experts are White on those shows.</p>

		<p>Printing the blatant, overwhelming statistics makes no difference. There is either a reason for them; i.e.,&rsquo;the disadvantaged are downtrodden and backed into a corner, they are forced to struggle for their survival&rsquo;, &#8216;blacks are disproportionally arrested&rsquo;, blah, blah, or outright denial; &#8216;the statistics are manipulated; they&rsquo;re totally false.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Proof by the numbers still isn&rsquo;t proof to them.</p>

<p>Hahahaha right, even in the networks depiction of a known, sensational crime with a black culprit, it is played by a White person! ALSO!!!! I just watched &#8220;District 9&#8221; and in it, is portrayed blacks in SA carrying on EXACTLY as blacks do everywhere! go look at the movie if you haven&rsquo;t.

		<p>Golly, look at all the blue dots! Who would have guessed that the legacy of Jim Crow would have such profound consequences all the way to the year 2009.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we must do.</p>
<p>Spend more money on free food, free housing, and free medical care for society&rsquo;s most vulnerable members (the blue dots). We must make sure they get a hot breakfast every day of the year. We must make sure they never get F&rsquo;s in school. We must give them hiring preferences and punish any employer who dares to fire one.</p>
<p>Only thus can we give them the crucial self-esteem necessary to stop committing murder so often.</p>

		<p>Is there anything in this graphic we didn&rsquo;t learn from The Color of Crime. Relative murder rates for Asian: White: Hispanic: Black races are 0.5 : 1: 4: 9. IQ and murder rates for the races are the fundamental constants of sociology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before murder rates in the country return to early 1970&rsquo;s levels as the justice system becomes widely politicized by the minority occupation government of Obama.</p>

<p>Staten Island is the only NYC Borough with a white majority (according to Wikipedia, 67.4 non-hispanic white.)It is the most Italian-American county in the US, at 37.7%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Queens originally, and every person I&rsquo;ve ever known from Staten Island was of Italian, Irish, or Jewish descent. (Wikipedia states that SI&rsquo;s population is 10.4% German or Polish, I&rsquo;d say the vast majority of these people are actually Jewish.)</p>
<p>SI is a very suburban kind of place, the houses are on small plots of land, but aside from that, the demographics and the lifestyle are similar to any other suburban area in the Northeast. (There were actually a number of working farms on SI until around 1970!)</p>
<p>Blacks generally live in the northern part of the island, around St George, New Brighton, etc., places easily reached from Manhattan by the ferry. The few dots listed on the above map are the areas with concentrations of blacks &amp; hispanics. </p>

		<p>You can go to small towns across America that have a similar or larger population percentage of blacks or Mex&rsquo;s and find those same crime stats, there have also been several studies as to the very high numbers of crimes that go unreported in those areas. I really don&rsquo;t feel that people are shocked by these stats, but it is underreportedby media.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight #52, whether Jews are a religion or an &#8220;ethnic group/race&#8221; depends on the context.  I&rsquo;m not religious but I&rsquo;ll always be a Jew.  People sometimes guess that I&rsquo;m a Jew just by looking at me (or they take me for an Arab or Mexican).  Most Jews are not religious but they are still Jews.  Some who practice Judaism are Jewish by religion but not ethnic Jews nor will they ever be.</p>

***********<br>
That&rsquo;s an overly simplistic statement which does not necessarily hold true. Greenwich Village (6th Precinct) has one of the lowest crime rates in New York and is considered to be one of the safest areas of the city.  It is a very desirable place to live (just check the rents!).  It is also a highly desirable precinct for police to work in and much sought after because of its low crime and pleasant working conditions. You don&rsquo;t get a spot there easily without having some pull or seniority.  Most cops there are veterans who have earned the assignment and would not willingly give it up.</p>
<p>It also happens to be home to a heavily gay population, New York University, and many other unmarrieds  (students, young professionals, etc). Though it&rsquo;s not conspicuous, there is a lot of money there. Many wealthy and famous people choose it as their home.  Many of them are not married.  What crime does occur there is almost always committed by roving &#8220;youths&#8221; who come in FROM OUTSIDE looking for loot or prey. Amost invariably they are from New Jersey or Brooklyn, or down from Harlem. It&rsquo;s predictable. I should know because I  worked there for many years. It is very rare to have crimes committed by local residents. What crime does exist is  committed almost exclusively by outsiders. So there goes your theory.</p>
