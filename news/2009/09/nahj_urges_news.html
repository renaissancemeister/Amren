<h1><a href="https://www.sys-con.com/node/1108247">NAHJ Urges News Media to Stop Using the Term &#8220;Illegals&#8221; When Covering Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Sept. 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the heated debates over health care and immigration reform collide, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists calls on our nation&rsquo;s news media to stop using the dehumanizing term &#8220;illegals&#8221; as a noun to refer to undocumented immigrants. </p>
<p>NAHJ has long advocated for accurate terminology in news coverage of immigration. NAHJ is concerned with the increasing use of pejorative terms like &#8220;illegals&#8221;  &mdash;  which is shorthand for &#8220;illegal aliens,&#8221; another term NAHJ objects to using  &mdash;  to describe the estimated 12 million undocumented people living in the United States. </p>
<p>Using &#8220;illegals&#8221; in this way is grammatically incorrect and crosses the line by dehumanizing and criminalizing the person, not the action they are purported to have committed. NAHJ calls on the media to never use &#8220;illegals&#8221; in headlines and in television news crawls. </p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to see &#8216;illegals&rsquo; used as a noun seeping from the fringes into the mainstream media, and in turn, into the mainstream political dialogue,&#8221; said NAHJ Executive Director Iván Román. &#8220;Using these terms not only distorts the debate, but it takes away their identities as individuals and human beings. When journalists do that, it&rsquo;s that much easier to treat them unfairly and not give them an equal voice in the controversy.&#8221; </p>
<p>By incessantly using metaphors like &#8220;illegals,&#8221; the news media is not only appropriating the rhetoric used by people on a particular side of the issue, but also the implication of something criminal or worthy of suspicion. That helps to predetermine the credibility or respect given to one of the protagonists of this debate, which is not conducive to good journalism and does a disservice to the principles of fairness and neutrality. </p>
<p>In addition, NAHJ has always denounced the use of the degrading terms &#8220;alien&#8221; and &#8220;illegal alien&#8221; to describe undocumented immigrants because it casts them as adverse, strange beings, inhuman outsiders who come to the U.S. with questionable motivations. &#8220;Aliens&#8221; is a bureaucratic term that should be avoided unless used in a quote. </p>
<p>NAHJ also calls on editors and journalists to follow generally accepted guidelines regarding race and ethnicity and refrain from reporting a person&rsquo;s legal status unless it is relevant to the story in question. The public in certain regions of the country have pressured news media to publish the legal status of any Latino who appears in the newspaper or on television, regardless of the story&rsquo;s subject. </p>
<p>Doing so contributes to the growing trend of profiling Latinos as non-Americans or foreigners and using them as scapegoats for a variety of society&rsquo;s ills, a tone that has become more pervasive in the public dialogue over the past few years. Few now doubt that this helps create a fertile environment for hate speech which we have seen can lead to discrimination and a growing number of hate crimes in the U.S. against Latinos. </p>
<p>As the U.S. tackles immigration reform in the future, NAHJ believes that responsible, fair, and non-simplistic coverage of this complex issue is in order. The words used can be part of the problem or can contribute to fair coverage and a fruitful public debate. <br>

		<p>The correct legal phrase is Illegal Alien.  It is not undocumented immigrant, undocumented citzens, migrants, immigrants, or undocumented workers.  Illegally documented would also be accurate seeing as most of them use phony ss cards or phony green cards.  </p>

		<p>The kind of journalists that would cede to NAHJ demands are the same ones that already avoid the use of &#8220;illegals,&#8221; &#8220;aliens,&#8221; and so on, preferring words like &#8220;undocumented.&#8221;  So it&rsquo;s a wash.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this article on another website and will give the same response I gave there. If illegal aliens (a perfectly legal term) is not to be used, then how about: &#8220;those persons who&rsquo;ve sneaked across our border, dishonored our immigration laws and presented fake names, false documents and bogus matricular cards.&#8221; Will that do? If not, I have more.</p>

		<p>Do we care what the National Association of Hispanic Journalists think?  These &#8220;undocumented&#8221; people are in the USA illegally, so let&rsquo;s stay with the plan and call it as we see it.  And I think &#8220;alien&#8221; adds a nice touch; they are totally foreign to the culture of the Native Born White American, as the culture of the Native Born White American is foreign to them.  I&rsquo;d like to see immigration reform aimed at sending every last illegal alien back to their homelands. </p>

		<p>The people responsible for this announcement obviously need to go back to high school English class.</p>
<p>Grammatically incorrect?  Why?  The release implies, but does not state, the the problem is the use of the adjective.  There is  nothing wrong with this, nothing at all.  It is a common occurrence and has a name: an adjective used as a noun is being used &#8220;substantively.&#8221;  The journalists do it every day.  </p>
<p>Quick example for those of you who are not English teachers: &#8220;Out with the old, in with the new.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next point: the use of the adjective &#8220;illegal&#8221; or the substantive &#8220;illegals&#8221; is not a metaphor. It&rsquo;s just not.  Maybe these people don&rsquo;t know what a metaphor is.</p>
<p>OK, that&rsquo;s the linguistic analysis.  Others can point out how wrong headed these Hispanic journalists are.</p>
<p>One more thing: would the NAHJ object to the use of &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; as a  noun?</p>

		<p>They are in the country illegally, you want to see what they do in the rest of the world, not the whiny west, but countries that respect their citizens and its culture.<br>
Next I suspect we will be asked to call rapists forceful lovers.<br>
Burglars re-distribution of wealth operatives.<br>
Murderers will of course always be &#8220;youths&#8221; who have made an unfortunate mistake.<br>
The Pakistanis came to England, the Turks to Germany, the Morrocans  to France, as soon as the public had their measure, the term Paki or Turk or whatever with synonymous with Schweinehund so the very first thing the ultra correct did was to disguise the truth, calling a Paki a Paki in England is a crime. So the United States too is going the way of the ultra liberals, do everything but speak the truth.</p>

		<p>The insanity of this is hard for me to express.</p>
<p>Burglars should no longer be called burglars. They are now &#8220;home wealth redistributors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shoplifters are no longer shoplifters. They are now &#8220;financially-constrained buyers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rapists are no longer rapists. We must now call them &#8220;sexual discrimination protestors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Muggers aren&rsquo;t really muggers. They are now &#8220;legacy-of-slavery victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gang-bangers are not gang-bangers. They are really &#8220;alternative youth groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Child molesters are not child molesters. They are really &#8220;age-differentiated lovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>A nation&rsquo;s borders are not really borders. They are now &#8220;hypothetical area markers.&#8221;</p>
<p>A nations laws are not really laws. They are merely &#8220;legalistic social constructs.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, we can&rsquo;t have any &#8220;dehumanizing&#8221; of lawbreakers!</p>
<p>Who was it who said that the re-definition of words is the first step towards mind control?</p>
<p>And so goes the total and complete collapse of society.</p>

		<p><i>stop using the dehumanizing term &ldquo;illegals&rdquo; as a noun to refer to undocumented immigrants.</i></p>
<p>It would be interesting to look into the background of this National Association of Hispanic Journalists and see how often, in their various writings and other press releases, they use the term &#8220;racist,&#8221; which is intended to dehumanize whites who speak out in favor of their own racial group interests?</p>

		<p>..&#8221;By incessantly using metaphors like &ldquo;illegals,&rdquo;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&gt; These monkeys may know how to spell (or use spell check), but they don&rsquo;t know the meaning of words, or they think that they can create meaning and foist it onto other minds.  IN fact, this is what &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are always doing; they play with words in a way that they think will work to their advantage.</p>
<p>&gt; The term &#8220;illegal&#8221; is not being used as a metaphor, but a definition of lawful status within the borders of a nation that they have entered without documentation and without due process by any authority.  If it were a metaphor, there would be an alternative to define them, and there isn&rsquo;t.  The fact is that if you enter a country illegally you have already commited a crime and authorities are right to assume that such an individual might engage in other illegal acts.  Of course, our crime stats prove this to be true.  So this paragraph and in fact the entire editorial or essay is bogus nonsense on its face. </p>
<p>&#8220;Using &ldquo;illegals&rdquo; in this way is grammatically incorrect and crosses the line&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt; I love this because this is from a run-on sentence itself!  It also infers that people called &#8220;illegals&#8221; are being used &#8220;in this way!&#8221;  This article is full of gramatical mistakes! </p>
<p>&gt; And who says what &#8220;line&#8221; is being crossed?  Who drew a line?  What a borderline?  The irony screams at me!  They crossed an actual line and now this self-described journalist accuses others of crossing a metaphorical line!!!???</p>
<p>&ldquo;We continue to see &lsquo;illegals&rsquo; used as a noun&#8221;&hellip;..</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegals&#8221; is a noun as defined as a person, place, or thing - or idea.  Illegal could be seen as an adjective if it were being used to modify another noun, such as &#8220;alien.&#8221;  But if you remove the &#8220;alien,&#8221; then &#8220;illegal&#8221; becomes, by default, the noun.  The border between adjectives and nouns is a little gray in the English language and newcomers may not be familiar with that fact. </p>
<p> &gt; Using &#8220;illegals&#8221; to denote a group of people who may be defined repeatedly as sharing the same identifiable characteristic, such as an illegal presence in a nation is not a violation of the English language as I have illustrated above.  </p>
<p>&gt; Note; Hispanic is also used, or abused, in this way.  Just as one person may be said to be of Hispanic origin (a questionable use of the term for anyone born in the New World, not born in Spain) one person may be described as an illegal in a nation.  So Hispanics and Illegals share the same mechanism of language logic to become a DIFFERENT type of noun.  But the term is still a noun.  So if this editor is going to complain about the use of terms in the English language that pertain to their ongoing creation of terms and such, then Latino, Latina, Hispanic, Chicano, etc., terms that have been used as a racial descriptor of the same racial group, ought to be put to the same exam by the editor.  I would love to read the use of logic by this editor in explaining these &#8220;nouns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Definition: Hispania was the name given by the Romans to the whole of the Iberian Peninsula (modern Portugal, Spain, Andorra, Gibraltar and a very small southern part of France). LOOK IT UP!</p>
<p>&gt; So how do mestizos co-opt this term to describe themselves as if they were actually citizens of this region of the world?  The answer is that they appropriate such a term as an act of national and racial narcissism and rely on the lack of education of the people they teach it.  That means themselves and others, such as us.  They then rely on the tolerance of listeners who do not make an issue of such a detail.  But with such a loose manner of acquiring self definitions, the new &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; seek to put the nonsense over on our entire nation.  </p>
<p>Now it has come to them actually attempting to define and dictate how the English language is to be used in a nation where free speech and freedom of the press is a cornerstone.  How long are we to tolerate their arrogance?</p>

		<p><b>&#8220;Undocumented&#8221; (alien) is an incorrect, if not outright deceitful, descriptor as the majority of illegal aliens ARE documented, albeit with forged or stolen documents.</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanics&#8221; insistence of using that misleading descriptor is but a symptom of a larger phenomenon. </p>
<p>They inherited the culture of conquest and deceit from their ancestors, Spaniards and Aztecs, that is so dramatically different from the culture of Euro-Protestant settlers. For instance, the crooked &#8220;arguments&#8221; that &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; (mostly, Mexicans) perpetuate are so much in accord with Cortez&rsquo;s, who conquered Aztec Empire with help of lies and intrigues, and so distant from what the American Founding Fathers stood for.</p>
<p>Anyway, each time you witness the lies, the intrigues, and the irredentist claims of &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; lobby it&rsquo;s good to ask yourself this question: what would Cortez and his conquistadores do under the circumstances, and would the Founding Fathers came up with similar tricks? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that we always remember how little the Spanish Empire and it&rsquo;s post-mortem offspring, Mexico, have in common with the U.S.<br>

		<p>Using the term &#8220;illegal&#8221; criminalizes the person huh? Sorry Senior or Senorita, but the people who cross the border illegally, drive without licenses and insurance, drink and drive, steal social security numbers, and commit a host of other crimes ARE criminals. However, I am open to compromise. For the sake of grammatical correctness I will make it a point to use the full term &#8220;illegal immigrant&#8221; or &#8220;illegal alien&#8221; when referring to the individuals who choose to do this. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got news for National Association of Hispanic Journalists. I&rsquo;m well travelled in Latin America and have also had a three year residency in Central America. I can unequivocably assert the following points as they relate to journalistic practices in non-tabloid mainstream daily newspapers of record in major metropolitan areas throughout Latin America:</p>
<p>Any story; good, bad, or indifferent that involves people of foreign origins will invariably point out those persons&rsquo; foreign origins regardless of immigration or citizenship status. </p>
<p>Any crime or scandal related story with bad guys of foreign origin will (somewhere between top fold headlines and third paragraph) conspicuously and clearly lay out the details of the foreigners&rsquo; origins, immigration history, and status on date of indictment/arrest.<br>

		<p>The word &#8216;illegal&rsquo; simply means that a law has been transgressed - which in the case of migrants who willingly and knowingly transgressed such immigration controls that do exist, amply defines their character.<br>
 What these agitators really want is to question the very concept of self-defined nation states beiing able to determine their own immigration policies in the context of the democratic will of their electorates.<br>

		<p>It won&rsquo;t be long when the media starts referring to Whites whose ancestors carved out this nation as the ILLEGALS. They will cry about the southwest as really belonging to the Mexicans and we stole it from them.That confuses me because I thought we stole it from the Indians?!..<br>
They will never talk about how the place was a barren desert until whites built mighty dams to make the place inhabitable.<br>
When they do take over I hope as the last whites are leaving the southwest we pull the plug on those dams (permanantly) and see what they do without whitey.<br>

		<p>Hispanics are waging a vicious race war against the Native Born White American majority. Their strategy is to import an unliited number of hispanic aliens with the intent of outbreeding the Native Born White majority. Nothing could be more obvious. It is outrageous that hispanics think that that the Native Born White American should sit back passively and and allow hispanics to force Native Born White Ameriacns to subsidize their own race-placement at the hands of hispanics and other post-1965 non-whites. </p>
<p>Native Born White Americans are under no obligation to commit racial suicide within the borfers of Americans because hispanics demand it.</p>
<p>What I have written should be stated up front in every TV and radio &#8220;debate&#8221;.</p>

		<p>   I agree with Jupiter, with one addendum, what is truly outrageous is that our president and congress are being bought off and are commiting treason against this country. They are the driving force behind the ILLEGAL ALIENS in their bid to take over this country. Do they really think they will be rewarded by the ILLEGALS once this has happened? My belief is that they will get what they deserve in the end.</p>

immigration status</p>
<p> Flaxen-headed Strumpet is absolutely correct, they in fact make a very big deal of the foreigners. It is the same in Arab countries, commit a crime, you&rsquo;re in the morning paper, immigration status and all EXCEPT!! in Arab countries if you are there illegally, YOU ARE A CRIMINAL and treated ruthlessly as such. The only good thing about Arab countries but it is a real good thing. There are no illegals pandering associations in Arab countries.</p>

		<p>Most important point that has been touched upon in a couple posts above: the exact same reasoning can be applied to the term &#8216;racist&rsquo; but you won&rsquo;t hear any of these non-white advocacy groups (&#8216;journalists&rsquo;) calling for that term to be dropped.</p>

		<p>Those who argue over whether or not &#8220;illegals&#8221; is offensive are missing the point. As whites, if we begin to speak the way Latinos want us to speak, we will only be showing weakness. If we at all compromise with non-white advocacy groups, then they will pounce upon our lack of resolve to defend our race. As white nationalists, we must adopt an uncompromising attitude when fighting for our interests. </p>

immigration status&#8221;</p>
<p>This makes so much sense. Every country has its own criminals to deal with. So why import criminals?  N. America and W. Europe just keep importing criminals and S. America keeps exporting them to us.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a little bit of trivia about hispanic immigrants in S. California.  It&rsquo;s summer.  It&rsquo;s hot. People are wearing light summer clothes.  But the buses are ferociously air conditioned.  People complain and complain.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse in winter.  The buses are still air conditioned.  Our winters are not really cold,65 to 45 degrees,  but they are rainy. So you get your feet and legs wet in the winter rain and get on an air conditioned bus where the air vents blast cold air all over.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason for the 55 degree air conditioning.  TB germs, especially that new strain imported along with the illegals, teh drug resistant strain.</p>
<p>The drivers keep the buses so cold because the cold keeps the numerous germs, including drug resistant TB germs from growing.<br>
Think about it.  Bus drivers are exposed to thousands of passengers every day.  S. California buses are full of S. American Indians and other immigrants all with their third world untreated diseases including drug resistant TB. The drivers don&rsquo;t want to get TB so they are advised to keep the air conditioners cranked up.</p>
<p>TB is air borne and very easy to catch.  People have contracted TB from riding on a plane with a TB patient or even frequenting bars where a TB patient is also a regular customer.  In the 19th and early 20th century landlords were required to fumigate apartments that had been lived in by TB patients to prevent new tenants from getting the disease.</p>
<p>Then there are all those obese hispanic kids with Child Onset Diabetes, the most severe kind that will require life long treatment.  Many blacks get diabetes because they are obese, but Adult Onset is less serious they get it as adults in their 40&rsquo;s and require less treatment and of course they don&rsquo;t need treatment from the age of 6 on.<br>

		<p>Nothing is a 100 percent perfect and that goes for the government application E-Verify? The answer for any irate hired worker is simple, that if the employer is not satisfied with the results of the immigration verification identity process? You take a copy of your 1-9 form to the Social security agency, to resolve the issue? YOU WILL OBVIOUSLY NOT APPEAR BEFORE AN AGENT OF THE GOVERNMENT, IF YOU HAVE NO AUTHENTIC PAPERS? This is not a complex approach to the problem, although the US Chamber of Commerce, ACLU and a multitude of detrimental businesses have tried to escalate this situation? They say categorically nothing about how to rectify the matter, owing to their main objective is to demonize the process any way they can? Even their adolescent attitude of filing some frivolous lawsuit with the courts fell through?</p>
<p>E-Verification  &mdash;  MUST  &mdash;  become a permanent law, not just subject to an employer&rsquo;s whim?  The public who savor their jobs not being appropriated by foreign workers  &mdash;  AS HAPPENED IN EUROPE  &mdash;  should demand E-Verify in every industry, every business with heavy penalties for those who rebuke the law including mandatory jail sentences. EUROPE over several decades has also been  overwhelmed by legal and illegal immigrants, thats why health care across the Atlantic has become compromised?   E-Verify could be easily expanded for many other uses in the US, including admittance to health care, drivers licenses, government subsidies that would include education and home mortgages? My family wants a comprehensive package of health care reform pass, then to me it&rsquo;s obviously important to me as well?</p>
<p>But we must remain vigilant as the status quo has in their influence a group of stalwart politicians. They have secretly conspired to table E-Verify in the past and will no doubt try to eradicate it&rsquo;s accessibility in the future. Hundreds of pariah businesses are devoid of a conscious towards the American working man or woman. They have corrupted the lawmakers in Washington, with special interest money and extravagant favors. They have already indoctrinated some of our previously honest leaders with favors and in return we have seen the weakening of 287 G police training apprehension of illegal immigrants. Already President Obama has listened to Sen.Harry Reid D-NV, California&rsquo;s own Nancy Pelosi and Napolitano who have weakened other enforcement laws. NO! Innocent children of illegal immigrants who were transplanted by their parents here are not to blame. Our borders have remained like sieves, thanks to  some of the  lawmakers whom we voted for over the years. Legislators are ultimately culpable as they make the decisions, as by inheritance of each administration  who  resides in the White House?</p>
<p>Money was wasted on building the single length border fence instead of Rep.Duncan Hunters planned two-tier barrier as in San Diego?  ICE raids have been reduced and even the No-match-rescinded. More money is wasted overturning enforcement laws, instead of using the full force of these procedures in combating the illegal immigrant invasion.  IF YOU HAVE SOME SOLID KNOWLEDGE OF ILLEGAL WORKERS, CONTACT ICE!  ADDRESS YOUR POLITICIANS AT 202-224-3121 NO MORE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM! IT IS NOT IN THE COUNTRIES INTEREST.  USE AMENDMENTS TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS WITH THE 1986 IMMIGRATION LAWS ALREADY ENACTED. Learn facts not rhetoric or lies at NUMBERSUSA &amp; JUDICIAL WATCH &amp; CAPSWEB.</p>

<p>We think in pictures.  &mdash;  Aristotle</p>
<p>If you control the language you control the thinking. Illegal alien suggests there is illegality involved, and the person in question is foreign, both true. Undocumented immigrants, suggests folks who may have misplaced their documents and might even by thought of as &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, both false.</p>

		<p>ILLEGAL immigrant. That very term means they are criminals because they knowingly and with pre-meditation, crossed the border without documentation knowing this was illegal. </p>
<p>This term is correct when applied to all of the other millions of illegal immigrants in the US who are being harbored. </p>
<p>Harboring and succoring these criminals who have NO RIGHT to be in this country. Weed them out and deport them - immediately!! <br>

		<p>In response to the last paragraph describing illegal immigration as a &#8220;complex problem&#8221; I fail to see the complexity of it. It seems very simple to me. These individuals are here illegally. That&rsquo;s it. Cased closed. They have chosen to willingly ignore the national border agreements and federal laws prohibiting unlawful entry into annother sovereign nation. That being said they are here in this country &#8220;illegally&#8221;. There is no grey area here and believe me, no other nation on earth tolerates the unchecked crossing of borders the way this government does. In many nation states, violations could and would be met with serious reprocussions to include death in order to protect their citizens from invasion or other harm.<br>
Once again, here in the US it is common knowledge that there are steps in place to be able to apply for temporary visas, and paths to more permanent residency exist also. I would argue that this should cease in times of war or at best, should be enforced with a much higher dilligence, but my friends that is for annother discussion. <br>
Quite simply, illegal aliens have broken the law and should expect no quarter or special considerations. These lawbreakers are no differant than those who choose to steal mail, rob buisnesses, create arson, or harm others, etc, etc in the fact that they are breaking at least one set of laws by doing so. <br>
My last point is this, if Latinos are offended by or upset about being profiled for suspicion, maybe they should take a look at their own people and realize that their attitudes toward illegals, and the harboring and support of such law violators are casting them in a bad way. When I see Mexican flags, sanctuary cities, and unapologetic pressure from groups like La Raza, I don&rsquo;t think it is the lawful American citizens&rsquo; perceptions that are skewed, but in fact the behavior and attitudes of the &#8220;illegals&#8221; and their supporters!</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;We continue to see &lsquo;illegals&rsquo; used as a noun seeping from the fringes into the mainstream media, and in turn, into the mainstream political dialogue,&rdquo; said NAHJ Executive Director Iván Román. &ldquo;Using these terms not only distorts the debate, but it takes away their identities as individuals and human beings. When journalists do that, it&rsquo;s that much easier to treat them unfairly and not give them an equal voice in the controversy.&rdquo; &#8220;<br>
Come here LEGALLY, become AMERICANS, and you can have that &#8220;equal voice&#8221;; sneak into this country like a thief and demand equality gets you nothing but my contempt, along with your leadership, like this jerk, as well.</p>
