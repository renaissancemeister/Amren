<h1>A Brick of a Speech</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pejman Yousefzadeh, New Ledger, September 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I can certainly appreciate [Michael] Jordan&rsquo;s competitive instincts, and to say the least, they manifested themselves in the course of his speech. It is obvious that in addition to the inner fire that carried him from triumph to triumph on the basketball court, there were a number of slights and insults along the way that fueled his will to win still further. Jordan channeled those slights and insults in the best way possible while a player; the best revenge is beating the people who dissed you, and Jordan certainly got his revenge on anyone stupid enough to talk smack about him and/or his game. But there was no reason whatsoever to remind people of those slights  &mdash;  and Jordan&rsquo;s lingering resentment  &mdash;  on the occasion of his induction into the Hall. Jordan&rsquo;s speech was an opportunity to be magnanimous, gracious, humble, and appreciative of all of the people who helped him achieve what he achieved. As for the people who upset or slighted him, the best answer would have been silence; Jordan&rsquo;s induction into the Hall of Fame meant that those people failed in their efforts to either diminish or outright sabotage His Airness&rsquo;s career, and there was, therefore, no reason whatsoever to mention them. {snip}</p>
<p>About Jordan&rsquo;s remarks to his kids .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the less said the better. But how does any father tell his kids  &mdash;  while the whole world is watching, no less  &mdash;  that it is going to suck to be them because there will be no way for the kids to get themselves out of their father&rsquo;s shadow? Instead of encouraging his kids to live their dreams and make their own way, Jordan seemed to lord his accomplishments over his children. The word &#8220;scummy&#8221; comes to mind.</p>

		<p>I have better things to do, (Like Watching Top-Cat in Icelandic on You-tube) than comment on this. But I will say I have been unable to find the complete speech anywhere on the net. All I have seen are snippets where he praises instead of dismisses. The media must be working overtime on spin control&hellip;</p>

		<p>I have worked as a speechwriter for years (I don&rsquo;t currently), and know that MJ could have gotten the best in the biz for probably $20K max, and he should have spent the money. </p>
<p>Something like this would have been easy money for me - some reminiscences, some thanks, an anecdote or two. You&rsquo;ve got one of the most beloved and admired people in the world speaking.  There&rsquo;s more goodwill in the audience than you could hope for than with all but a few people in the world.  It would be hard to mess up.  But the key in a speech like this is to err on the side of being magnanimous, and Jordan failed miserably. </p>

		<p>Speaking of one Michael Jeffrey Jordan, when his father was murdered in North Carolina so many years ago, and suspects were caught, the media kept trying to pass them off as white.  As a matter of fact, two of the three were from a tribe of Indians that had been in North Carolina for quite a long time.</p>

<p>This is just the same typical black distortion of themselves as something greater than they are in their own minds.  Black arrogance is an anchor around their necks that serves as a memo that they are burdened with a feeling of self-importance.</p>
<p>A lot of it can be attributed to stupidity, so, in effect, what they&rsquo;re doing when they utter inanities like this is bragging about being stupid.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure who Michael Jordan is, although it would take me seconds to look him up.  It&rsquo;s just amusing to read an essay written by someone obsessed with a person who literally means nothing to me.<br>

<p>While it&rsquo;s not the most gracious speech I&rsquo;ve ever heard, it&rsquo;s not too horrible.  (It would have been better if he left his kids out of it.) I think there are bigger fish to fry.</p>

		<p>Just like Tiger Woods cover up.  White liberals want a black they can parade around as white-acting.  Michael Jordan is as shallow as one might have guessed.  Your just not supposed to use those instincts.  Of course unless you are black and judging every white as an individual isnt necessary like it is for whites.  All whites are bigots because of a few but because many blacks are violent you should judge every one by their character.  You go walk off that cliff, dont ask me to.</p>

		<p>This speech was so High School! You didn&rsquo;t play varsity your sophmore year. Get over it!<br>
    I am from chicago. He was always this immature. He is the one that started the Ghettoing of the NBA. <br>
    I note that he never said anything bad about Bill Lambier. MJ was probaly afraid he would slap him down like he did when he was in the NBA. After Lambier retired, suddenly the Bulls started winning. Lambier was able to stop MJ and many others copied his style.  <br>

		<p>AmRen, let&rsquo;s stay focused. What is this drivel that you have chosen to splash on your front page? Because some obscure Chicago blogger doesn&rsquo;t like the way Jordan did/didn&rsquo;t stroke his children and/or detractors during his Hall of Fame inductance speech is laughable. Michael Jordan was an ATHLETIC genius and forever will be the NBA&rsquo;s Greatest Player of All Time(regardless of what you crusty whites have to say about it).I visit AmRen for the unadulterated race realist truth.Even as a &#8216;black&rsquo; man I am intellectually honest enough to know that, ON AVERAGE, Blacks and other non-Europeans are inferior to them in all aspects of life.My earlier jab at Whitey was only for provocation. I admire Jared Taylor, Rushton, Duke and other race realists and have purchased a good deal of their writings. By the way, Lambier was a good player. But to the ignorant non-athlete who suggested that he was able to STOP Michael Jordan himself: You deserve a &#8216;slap-down&rsquo; yourself.</p>

		<p>standard english is shunned by blacks because it sounds too white. Yet who would give a job, besides sports and entertainment, to someone who sounds like they just stepped out of the ghetto? I keep asking myself, how do they come to speak like that? Even Mexicans can speak better english! </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s simply beyond a black to be magnanimous, humble, or get past slights real or imagined.  Simply impossible.  Their resentment does NOT come from slavery or being held down.  It&rsquo;s inate.  Want to argue that point?  Then show me a single African country that is not tribal, violent, and completely unable to govern themselves OR their passions and violence.<br>

		<p>Jordan would never have become a mega-superstar without the league&rsquo;s complicity. Referees were ordered to let him travel, throw elbows, and commit other infractions. That shot he hit to win the 1998 final came after he shoved an opponent aside to give himself a clear look. Anyone else would have been whistled for a charging foul and the game would have been over. It&rsquo;s one thing to protect certain players from injury (NFL quarterbacks, soccer &amp; hockey forwards); it&rsquo;s another thing altogether to effectively exempt them from the rules. Anyone who truly values integrity in sports would put today&rsquo;s NBA in the same category as the WWE.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blacks can&rsquo;t get past slights,,real or imagined&#8221;,,,</p>
<p>You are bang on! Blacks are an incredibly easily offended people. I often had to point out and report on their (numerous) errors, shortcomings and omissions at work. I was always accosted for it in very inapropriate terms. I don&rsquo;t know what accounts for it. Immaturity? An over-compensated inferiority complex? But regardless it is there and is ingrained in them.</p>

		<p>Blacks have two states of existence; insecure and getting insecure, mad and getting mad, stupid and showing how stupid they are, victims and mad at Jews for being bigger victims, do you get the picture?  Parallels are endless.</p>
<p>Only through a game and entertainment can they do anything for a temporary victory.  Then they blow it when the game or song ends.</p>
<p><br>
His speech was more than a brick, it was proof of something desparate in our society.</p>
