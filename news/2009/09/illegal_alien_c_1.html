<h1>Illegal Alien Child Molester Secretly Awarded $4 Million by Orange County, CA</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner (Virginia), September 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On April 17, 2009, the Orange County Board of Supervisors agreed to pay $3.75 million, plus an additional $900,000 in medical expenses to an illegal alien who was severely beaten by other inmates in the Orange County Central Jail. The Mexican national filed a lawsuit shortly after the incident.</p>
<p>Fernando Ramirez, 24, was in jail after being charged with molesting a 6-year-old girl at a local park. He eventually pled guilty to the lesser charge of battery against a child.</p>
<p>According to his attorney, Ramirez suffered brain damage and now needs help walking. Attorney Mark Eisenberg also claims that his client has been left with an intellect of a 4-year-old child.</p>
<p>Despite the dire financial crisis facing Orange County, Ramirez received the largest settlement ever awarded by the county for an in-custody incident. The Board of Supervisors made their decision in a closed-door session and have refused any comment on the matter.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to contact the Orange County Board of Supervisors to discuss the Ramirez settlement, I have included the following contact list for your convenience:</p>
<p>-Board Chair Patricia C. Bates, Supervisor Fifth District (ph #: 714-834-3550)</p>
<p>-Vice Chair Janet Nguyen, Supervisor First District (ph #: 714-834-3110)</p>
<p>-John M.W. Moorlach, Supervisor Second District (ph #: 714-834-3220)</p>
<p>-Bill Campbell, Supervisor Third District (ph #: 714-834-3330)</p>
<p>-Chris Norby, Supervisor Fourth District (ph #: 714-834-3440)</p>
<p>Reporter&rsquo;s note: Except for one story carried by the Orange County Register, there has been no press coverage of this matter. One would think that an illegal alien child molester becoming a millionaire through taxpayer funding would be big news.</p>
<p>Of course, a story such as this one would make people angry, and maybe even angry enough to hold their elected representatives accountable for the enormous crime wave being perpetrated by this country&rsquo;s illegal alien population.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which is more outrageous, the now-daily accounts of illegal aliens raping our women and children; our elected officials allowing our land to be transformed into a Third World nation; or a complicit mainstream press, eager to assist in the cover-up of our destruction.<br>

		<p>This was done secretly, because the traitorous and worthless bureaucrats that run the cities, counties and states in this nation, wanted to get this off the table, so they could relax and go back to doing nothing. The Judge, lawyers and every agent involved in this case that took 4 million dollars from the taxpayers, should all be recalled, fired, and have their law licenses taken away. But as one famous President might say, it simply is what it is. Don&rsquo;t worry, be happy. </p>

		<p>While I think $4 million is excessive, it is the responsibility of the jailers to ensure the safety of inmates.</p>

		<p>So&hellip;.and how many native born white inmates are victimized by blacks and other minorities while in our jails and prisons? And how many of them suffer just because they are white in predominately black jails, or prisons? There must be thousands of those. So, where is all the BILLIONS that should go to them(If this one illegal received 4 million.)? Another example of a minority receiving preferential treatment, as if we needed another example.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s clear to me that the state of California needs to drop off into the ocean. The inmates are running the asylum. The toxic level of insanity there is infecting the rest of the nation.</p>

		<p>The I.Q. of a four year old? Probably a step up. Well, if he&rsquo;s really in bad shape as far as I&rsquo;m concerned this story has a happy ending</p>

		<p>Who are they kidding here?  All of them have their slimy, sticky fingers in this settlement.  I would bet the lawyers got a big share, the judge probably got paid off, along with all the officials.   They robbed the taxpayers under the guise of helping the victim.   If the inmates had done their job correctly and killed the son-of-a-beesnest, the problem would have been solved!   This government and country and the officials who have found their ways into places of power are all treasonous liars and thieves and every last one has to be booted out of office!  PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA ESPECIALLY TAKE NOTE!</p>

		<p>Non-whites really are trying to run whites out of California. Their &#8216;racism&rsquo; is so ingrained it&rsquo;s not something that even needs to be said. The papers have all been saying it for them for the last 60 years. Their efforts are working. Imagine what it must be like for whites in prison in California? I mean even if white men were considered people, which they are not, it would still be pretty bad.  </p>

		<p>Well beside the other implications, one thing was rectified, This adult was interested in a child in an unhealthy way and in an unhealthy way he was reduced to a childs level. Karma</p>
