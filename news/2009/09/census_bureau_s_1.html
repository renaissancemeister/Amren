<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9ALCUJO0&amp;show_article=1">Census Bureau Severs Ties With ACORN in 2010 Count</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, Breitbart, September 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Census Bureau on Friday severed its ties with ACORN, a community organization that has been hit with Republican accusations of voter-registration fraud.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In splitting with ACORN, Groves [Census director Robert Groves] sought to tamp down GOP concerns and negative publicity that the partnership will taint the 2010 head count.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear that ACORN&rsquo;s affiliation with the 2010 census promotion has caused sufficient concern in the general public, has indeed become a distraction from our mission, and may even become a discouragement to public cooperation, negatively impacting 2010 census efforts,&#8221; Groves wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent months, Republicans have become increasingly critical of the census&rsquo; ties with ACORN, which stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. The group, which advocates for poor people, conducted a massive voter registration effort last year and became a target of conservatives when some employees were accused of submitting false registration forms with names such as &#8220;Mickey Mouse.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Census Bureau Severs Ties With ACORN in 2010 Count.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somehow, the pro-black administration will squeeze these people into some aspect of census work.  It might be another organization that is called by a different name, but it will be the same people working the census that would be doing so for Acorn.  The only difference is that they won&rsquo;t be wearing red T-shirts that say &#8220;Acorn&#8221; on them.</p>
<p>These radically biased black promoters are going to reflect an erroneous non-white count any way they can.  The mission statement for this entire group of Obama supporters is a vow to reduce the white power base by hook or crook.</p>
<p>These days are indeed America&rsquo;s darkest period.   </p>

		<p>Why does the Census Bureau need ACORN or any group to count people?  The answer I think is that they want a better count of blacks and Hispanics.</p>

More good news:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A poverty-rights group that has drawn the ire of conservatives suffered another setback in Washington on Monday when the U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly to deny it access to federal housing funds.</p>

<p>With the propensity for ridiculous and frankly retarded names in certain communities, it would not surprise me if some of these seemingly joke names, actually were serious.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t start celebrating yet. Even though ties with ACORN have been severed, means little. ACORN will spin off a new organization with the same people and then join the Census Bureau. It&rsquo;s like a gip joint that the police shut down one day and it just reopen the next under a new name.</p>
<p>These are Obama&rsquo;s people and they aren&rsquo;t going away. </p>
<p>Question Diversity wrote at 7:55 PM on September 14:<br>
&#8220;Why does the Census Bureau need ACORN or any group to count people?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Census Bureau needs volunteers to count people and ACORN under whatever name is more than happy to supply them. Maybe members of the Tea Party or Minutemen should volunteer. That would go over like a lead balloon with the Obama administration.</p>

		<p>This is a very fishy organisation and I&rsquo;m so pleased they are out of the Census count. <br>
 Wade Rathke founded ACORN and SEIU. <br>
The organisation &#8216;ACORN International&rsquo; is another Rathke founded and organised outfit, it has changed its name to Community Organisations International(COI), and is based in sunny Sicily. <br>
Wade Rathke stepped down from &#8216;ACORN&rsquo; last year because his family tried to cover up the fact that his brother Dale embezzled thousands from ACORN. But Wade only covered up the embezzlement in order to protect the organization from enemies don&rsquo;t you know!!<br>
Obama has(had)very close ties to ACORN and it&rsquo;s time there was an indpendent investigation into all the activities of this outfit.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the &#8216;clear distinction&rsquo; between these two organisations, ACORN and CIO, check out the following articles from the Chief Organizer Blog on the homepage of CIO.</p>

		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed with this.  Yes, I know that ACORN would have used control of the census to perpetrate yet another type of vote fraud&hellip;..this time to give minority areas greater representation by inflating their census numbers.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the real problem.  No, the real problem is the government supporting such a group.  They simply would have found another way to do their dirty deeds.</p>
<p>Now, Congress cutting off their funds.  THAT I am impressed with.  It shows they are starting to get it.  And more importantly, oppose &#8220;it&#8221;.  A promising sign.</p>
<p>There are two types of politicians.  The evil and the stupid. The evil ones do what they do no matter what.  The stupid ones, cooperate out of ignorance.  This is a sign that that the stupid ones are becoming far less clueless.  And no longer cooperating.</p>
<p>It is also a major sign that our government is NOT so securely in control of the fascists that they feel they can do as they please, no matter what.  If they were, they would simply ignore the ACORN scandel.</p>
<p>They FEAR us.  And that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;ll be no federal de-funding of ACORN.  The money will simply flow into other affiliate groups and make its way a bit more circuitously into ACORN&rsquo;s coffers.</p>
<p>As for the comically stupid buffoons who got caught up in this expose&rsquo;, they&rsquo;ll merely be reassigned to other organizations within ACORN&rsquo;s orbit.</p>
<p>This revolting &#8220;organization&#8221; is the black equivalent of the risible American Nazi Party.  That we have a man in the White House who has worked hand and hand with these criminals says something more than a little frightening about our electoral processes and the moral orientation of a huge minority of our citizens.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, friends. Our pandering politicians will find yet another way to get money to ACORN and buy themselves votes for next year&rsquo;s Mid-Terms.</p>
<p>Allow me to make a suggestion for the 2010 elections: RE-ELECT NOBODY! Kick the worthless political hacks out on their backsides. We need new blood, new thinking in Congress. Legislators that are for what our people need, not useless career politicians in it for themselves with a &#8220;screw the voters&#8221; mentality.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t miss this youtube video showing two ACORN members giving tax advice to a &#8220;pimp&#8221; and his &#8220;ho&#8221;:</p>

<p>I guarantee you&rsquo;ll never see it on ABC, CBS, MSNBC, or probably even Fox.  Which of course is why the mainstream media is worse than useless.</p>
