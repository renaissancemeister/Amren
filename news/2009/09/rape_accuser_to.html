<h1>Rape Accuser to Likely Face Charges</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NY1 News, Sept. 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Hofstra University freshman who accused four Bronx men and one Long Island man of gang raping her will likely face charges for her actions.</p>
<p>A law enforcement source told Newsday that the 18-year-old will likely be charged within days, although the source would not say what charges she would face.</p>
<p>Law enforcement sources have identified the woman as Danmell Ndonye of Washington Heights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hofstra officials say the woman has been suspended from school pending a disciplinary hearing.<br>

		<p>What?  No Hofstra 88 banging pots and demanding &#8220;justice?&#8221;  No scheming DA holding pep rallies to get blacks in the mood to riot?  I guess when all the parties are black the media doesn&rsquo;t know who to vilify.  If only the accused had been some white guys, it would make it so much easier for the media.</p>

		<p>So we add Danmell Ndonye to the likes of Tawana Brawley and Crystal Mangum. </p>
<p>Amazing. </p>

		<p>This really is too much.  I couldn&rsquo;t imagine any normal white female college student coming up with a story like this.</p>
<p>Now it all makes sense. Gosh, where are all Danmell&rsquo;s ardent defenders?</p>

		<p>There is an upside to all this. Young men, like the ones involved in the group that were accused might have second thoughts about doing things like it, for fear that the woman involved will accuse them of rape. Not the best reason for moral behavior, but certainly one that could work. </p>

		<p>Cel phone video refuted the rape claim, showing a black woman willingly participating in group sex with black men.  With neither a rape angle or a race angle, the story has no appeal.  </p>
<p>If the males were white, she&rsquo;d still be celebrated as a victim of racism, regardless of the consent. If the woman was white, she&rsquo;d be condemned as an immoral person, victimizing helpless black men.  </p>

		<p>I have never heard this story, and am wondering if the four accused were white men? If so, just how many times have black women falsely accused white men of gang raping them? We all remember Tawana Brawley, and more recently, the Duke stripper. It&rsquo;s reached the point where anytime a black woman claims white men have raped her, there is good reason to be suspicious, especially when you read how interracial rape where the rapist is white, and the victim is black, is nearly non-existent. Of course, reverse statistics are outrageously high</p>

		<p>Dopey White leftists, like the author of this piece, argue this girl was &#8220;troubled.&#8221;</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, anyone who lives among or near blacks knows this type of behavior is far more typical than most would like to believe.  I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for anyone involved in this sordid tale.  They deserve one another.</p>

		<p>Having watched the video, I see the accused to were black men. Why is it in this case the false accuser is facing charges, but not in the case of Crystal Gayle Mangum? Could it be, because in that instance the accused were white? And if so, Why? They went through months of hell, and their parents nearly lost their life savings trying to defend them in court. Justice may be blind, but it certainly is not color blind.</p>

		<p>She was at the dance with her boyfriend.  They got separated when she danced with one of the accused.  After a while he went looking for her, couldn&rsquo;t find her and went to her dorm room.  He knocked.  She came out looking dishelved and as though she had just had sex.  He asked what happened.  She said rape.  </p>
<p>The boyfriend insisted they call campus security, just as they were told to do by the feminazis in orientation.</p>
<p>The police investigation exonerated the men. The original Duke Lacrosse case police investigation also exonerated the men. That investigation was carried out by black detectives.  It was only later that 2 White race traitors, DA Nfong and a White detective decided to run with the false accusations and ruin the lives of 3 innocent White men.</p>

		<p>Of course, we all know that if the alleged rapists were white, the entire black community (I know, &#8220;black community&#8221; is quite an oxymoron) would be up in arms. And of course, if a white woman claimed to have been raped by four black men, the mainstream media would have dismissed her as a dumb, racist white woman. Besides, according to them, blacks are incapable of being racist. You know, despite the fact that our president, attorney general, and several cabinet members are black, they remain nothing but innocent angels. As a history major, I just hate the way blacks exploit historical abuses in order to intimidate whites today. They invoke the truly awful history of white slave owners raping black female slaves on plantations, as well as white men like Strom Thurmond raping black women and creating an entire Mulatto race. However, in contemporary United States, a black man is much more likely to rape a white woman than vice versa. For all those blacks who insist that they are completely innocent of racism, they need to realize that this isn&rsquo;t Jim Crow America anymore. Many of us whites are getting sick and tired of black anger and belligerence. When blacks actually follow the teachings of their heroes Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X,  and Louis Farrakhan by striving for self-improvement rather than begging whitey for help, then our racial crisis will take a step in the right direction.</p>

		<p>So now, let the DA charge this lier, and with her Conviction, let this &#8220;woman&#8221; do her time in Jail. This should be used as a warning to all those Black women, trying to use the Race/Rape Victim card, which has gotten very old. </p>

		<p>This whole incident illustrates another aspect of social decline: that during the base act of group-sex, video-recording the event would not represent cretinous behavior, but would be necessary to deflect later false criminal accusations.</p>
