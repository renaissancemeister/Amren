<h1>Affordable Housing Laws Aren&rsquo;t Stopping Segregation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rigil Oliveri, San Francisco Examiner, Sept. 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Affluent New York City suburb Westchester County recently agreed to spend more than $50 million to build or acquire 750 affordable housing units in order to help desegregate some of its almost entirely white towns and villages. It only did so because it had been sued.</p>
<p>In February, a federal court determined that Westchester had taken virtually no action to fulfill its promise to use millions of dollars in federal Community Development Block Grant money to further fair housing.</p>
<p>The level of residential racial segregation in the United States is pronounced. Of the 50 U.S. metropolitan areas with the largest black populations, all show a moderate to high level of segregation. Westchester is unusually high.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After the passage of fair housing and fair lending laws in the late 1960s, municipalities turned to more subtle tactics. Instead of relying explicitly on race, they exploited the &#8220;wealth gap&#8221; that decades of discrimination had created between black and white families.</p>
<p>Zoning boards imposed minimum square footage, setbacks and acreage requirements on homes in white areas, and limited the construction of smaller homes and apartment buildings to neighborhoods with larger concentrations of minorities. As a result, many black households who were leaving rentals or severely underpriced homes in the center of cities were unable to move into wealthy white communities.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to desegregate an all-white area is to create affordable housing opportunities there. This is generally what recipients of Community Development Block Grants are expected to do with at least a portion of the funds.</p>
<p>Local governments often resist doing so, fearing the ire of affluent white citizens who refuse to allow racial and economic diversity in &#8220;their&#8221; neighborhoods. Westchester, for example, limited most of its affordable housing to areas with higher concentrations of minorities, and built very little in its wealthy white communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Communities may choose to ignore the effects of generations of racialized housing policies. But they can&rsquo;t do so while taking federal money based on the explicit promise that they will use it to help correct this toxic legacy. Westchester is a warning that this isn&rsquo;t just a moral failing. It&rsquo;s illegal fraud.</p>

		<p>The reason is that affordable housing means moving more blacks and Hispanics in, which drives whites out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of most UnAffordable Housing programs even on a purely economic (i.e. non-racial) standpoint.  I can&rsquo;t tell you exactly why, but it seems to me the more that governments push &#8220;affordable&#8221; housing, the more unaffordable housing becomes.</p>

<p>Note the quotes around &#8220;their.&#8221;  In other words, despite the fact that the white citizens bought private property with their own money and chose where they wanted to live and who they wanted to live with, it&rsquo;s not really &#8220;their&#8221; neighborhood after all. </p>
<p>If that ain&rsquo;t socialism, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p></p>

		<p>We are about to sell our house that we worked very hard and went without to get just 4 years ago since the neighborhood is going downhill so fast. Behind us there is a house full of Hispanics who throw garbage, toys and beer bottles into our back yard and have knocked down the fence that we built several times. A few weeks ago one of the women who says that she is just visiting came over to see why my daughter was crying so much! There are many homes in the neighborhood where there are 6-8 cars in the driveway and you are not sure who lives there and who is &#8220;just visiting&#8221;. There are very few blacks but the Hispanics have taken over to the point where I cannot even take my daughter to the park without the Hispanic kids screaming that &#8220;this is our park&#8221; </p>

<p>The imbecile that wrote this is actually a professor? God help us.</p>
<p>Let me see if I&rsquo;ve got this right. They should create affordable housing in wealthy white communites which means that the white man buys a house at one price and the Black man buys a house next door at a greatly subsidised price. Then the black does not take care of the house and generally makes life miserable for his white neighbour. The value of the whole neighbourhood goes down the drain. The white man then loses twice as much money as the black who probably simply defaulted on his payments anyway. </p>

		<p>I just really find liberal gobily gook terms like &ldquo;affordable housing&rdquo; very galling. If a builder builds 100 houses that average $500,000 and they all sell then they ARE affordable.  They are bought by people who can AFFORD them. Generally speaking people who make less than $30,000 can&rsquo;t afford a house. Why don&rsquo;t they ( liberal/socialists)  just say it?!! FREE HOUSING!!! If poor people can&rsquo;t afford a cheap house in the intercity ghettoes then they can&rsquo;t afford it in the suburbs!!! </p>
<p>&ldquo;Rigel Oliveri is an associate professor at the University of Missouri School of Law, where she teaches fair housing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If one has a good income and savings and buys a house that they can afford, for what is seen as a FAIR price then that IS fair housing!!!!!! <br/>
Who needs some pin head nutty professor to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; that?!!! </p>
<p>People like Rigel Oliveri just can&rsquo;t stand it when normal successful people freely choose to live where they want to and LIKE and want to be around people like themselves. <br/>

		<p>Why is it so necessary for black people to move out of black neighborhoods in the first place?  We all know the answer, and so does Chris Rock.  The bottom half of the black population ruins whatever neighborhood it is put in.  Now our federal government insists that that bottom half be used to ruin white neighborhoods.  I have nothing but contempt for the politicians and media bigwigs who promote these destructive policies and never themselves have to live with the consequences.  (Just as none of the judges who ordered forced busing ever had his own children bused into a black neighborhood.)</p>
<p>Spartan24: You have described my own situation almost exactly.  My problem is that thanks to the housing bust there are so many houses for sale on my block that it will be almost impossible to sell. </p>

		<p>There is nothing &#8220;fair&#8221; about forced integration.  And to illustrate my point, let me remind leftist readers that the main excuse (made by leftists) for war in Africa is that the colonial powers fixed borders deliberately to cross tribal lines so that there would be   &mdash;  - DIVERSITY within national borders.  So, according to leftist thinking, those colonials did the Africans a great favor by bestowing upon them diversity.  So I&rsquo;m confused.  Why is it that diversity is considered a curse when it happens in Africa but a blessing when it&rsquo;s forced upon whites in Europe and the U.S.?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, but whites are the ones who usually granted affordable housing vouchers. These laws are implemented simply to break up white communities, and these days, living in a white community does not come cheap. They don&rsquo;t set up section 8 housing areas in America&rsquo;s China or Korea town districts, if you notice. This is why most ghetto areas almost always once started out white at one point. Although many former black enclaves are now becoming increasingly Hispanic. Not surprisingly, many such neighborhoods have all sorts of racial tensions. Although for obvious reasons, non-whites are more than happy to move in on a formerly white community.</p>

		<p>Now why would anyone want to leave &#8220;severely underpriced homes in the centers of cities&#8221; in the first place?  Doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;severely underpriced&#8221; translate to &#8220;fabulous bargain&#8221;?</p>
<p>And why would they want to leave the company of their wonderful black and brown peers, to dwell amongst us horrible, horrible, white people?  And they&rsquo;re giving up bargain prices on well-constructed older homes to live in shoddily-constructed, overpriced houses, in order to be subjected to the awful white people&rsquo;s presence?  Makes no sense.</p>
<p>So are these people really wanting to be saddled with quarter-million-dollar mortgages like the white folks?  Or do they expect to pay twenty thousand dollars, as they did for their inner-city digs?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being absurd, of course.  Reality is that &#8216;minorities&rsquo; want EVERYTHING, and have been conditioned to expect us whites to GIVE it to them.</p>

		<p>The definition of integration is the time between the first black family moving  into a neighborhood and the last white family moving  out. <br/>
My thinking is that the law is the law, and if a black can afford to live in a neighborhood and pay the same as anybody else, then, I live with it, and when that has happened to me it has not been bad. But&hellip; when subsidized blacks move into a neighborhood there are usually problems. This is because the subsidies are given to get these folks out of &#8216;bad&#8221; neighborhoods, where crime and despair stalk the streets. So.. the government just transplants the people and the problems they bring. </p>

		<p>Couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch of folks.  If the left tries hard enough, I&rsquo;m sure they can succeed at driving their affluent Yankee donors and voters right out of the party.</p>
<p>Once you get a good dose of diversity, you stop peddling it (unless you&rsquo;re truly deranged, or malfeasant like Tim Wise).</p>

<p>Government, local or otherwise SHOULD fear the wrath and ire of the people  &mdash;  especially those who elected them to power.  This is what the Founding Fathers intended, otherwise there is tyranny.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the people fear the government you have tyranny, when the government fears the people you have liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take liberty over the likes of leftist, egalitarian tyrants like Rigel Oliveri who always dictate to others what they themselves refuse to do  &mdash;  just like the old Soviet Bosses.  These morons refuse to learn any lessons from the old USSR  &mdash;  65 million dead, ethnic warfare, the country in shambles, assassination of &#8216;leaders&rsquo; the national sport.  </p>
<p>ANYONE suggesting Section 8 housing be put in a neighborhood not his own should be remanded to live either next to or inside of Section 8 housing permanently.</p>
<p>Keep a sharp eye on the local fools that run your city  &mdash;  a lot of them are drunk with power at the thought of bossing around other people (or are open to bribery from developers to sell out their cities).  They can wreck a lot of havoc locally and make your city unlivable very quickly.  Hold their feet to the fire, distribute petitions, threaten to defeat them soundly at the next election.</p>
<p>In my part of the former US, we Kalifornia Whites have watched for 40 years as  city after city collapsed into Third World Hell.  A few of my neighbors said Enough! when a large, 90-unit apartment building was approved for a small lot that once held a gas station.  The apartment building also had a number of designated units set aside for Section 8 tenants. Some of my neighbors went door to door, collected 900 signatures, stormed city hall and demanded an immediate halt to the apartment building.  </p>
<p>Seems they wanted to keep up their property values and didn&rsquo;t like the petty dictators in city hell telling them otherwise</p>
<p>A very small strip mall with a Starbucks now sits where the apartment building was once designated.  The pro-development coalition lost the next election  &mdash;  they went down screaming, blaming each other.  The developer, from Iran, screamed &#8216;racism&rsquo; at our neighborhood  &mdash;  and we just laughed as we sipped our $4.00 lattes&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Toxic Legacy&#8221;? I think that any liberal, guilt-ridden, &#8220;Diversity-Dingbat&#8221;, white person should be required to house at least one black person in that unused bedroom they have in their home. It&rsquo;s only right seeing as THEY are guilty of every wrong a white has ever done, to their way of thinking anyway(brainwashing complete). The government goes too far with its failed social engineering policy. So now choices for whites whom want to live away from minority cultures boil down to finding a few acres of land to build on (expensive and land for sale is getting harder to find) or joining some enclave of white separatists. Nothing wrong with that but I miss my rapidly stolen freedoms.</p>

		<p>Good.  I feel absolutely no sympathy for these people.  There is no doubt in my mind that these Westchester hypocrites had no problem with &#8220;diversity&#8221; as long as it was inflicted on poorer White neighborhoods.  I know how these people operate.  My mother attended a League of Women Voters in North Arlington peopled by affluent White women who took it upon themselves to propose low-income housing in a working class White neighborhood in SOUTH Arlington.  Until richer Whites can get it through their thick skulls that what they allow the government to do to poorer Whites they allow the government to eventually do to themselves, then there is no place far enough or fast enough Whites can run to get away from &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  </p>
