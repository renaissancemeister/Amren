<h1>Troubled Times in My Hometown</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Coren, National Post (Toronto), September 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The past tends to be viewed through a defiantly rose-tinted lens. My memory of childhood and youth is one of security, happiness and a glorious ordinariness. I grew up in a town in the south of England called Walthamstow. It&rsquo;s in the county of Essex but has long been an annex of East London. Working-class, earthy, bland, safe. I remember the local park where we played soccer until it was too dark to see the sweaters we&rsquo;d thrown down on the grass to act as goalposts.</p>
<p>I write this now because the image is painful and poignant for me. Walthamstow-raised 28-year-old Abdulla Ahmed Ali would meet with his gang in this same park to plan the largest terrorist bombing in British history, one that could have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women, children and babies, including Canadians flying on Air Canada jets from London to Toronto and Montreal. Ali and two others, Tanvir Hussain and Assad Sarwar, were convicted this week of conspiracy to commit mass murder. A fourth man was convicted of conspiracy to murder.</p>
<p>The group promised that &#8220;martyrdom operations upon martyrdom operations will keep on raining on these kuffars [non-believers]&#8221; and &#8220;ripping amongst your people and scattering the people and your body parts.&#8221; When asked if they had been brainwashed, their leader replied, &#8220;Yes my brain has been washed in the clean and cleansing waters of Islam and the Koran and the Sunnah [the path of the Prophet].&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be comforting to a certain degree, of course, to smugly assume that these men were aberrations, mere manifestations of angry and dysfunctional youth. There are two answers to such complacent and dangerous relativism. First, angry and dysfunctional youth fight and steal; they do not spend months planning slaughter. Second, these young Muslims are far from unique in a community that is deeply troubled and replicated throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Walthamstow itself is worth study. It was home to one of the men who helped kidnap American journalist Daniel Pearl, he who was told to &#8220;admit&#8221; he was a Jew before having his head cut off in front of a video camera. His kidnapper attended the expensive local private school in Walthamstow. (I and my friends came from families that could never have afforded such luxury.) The town and surrounding areas have seen an unparalleled increase in violent anti-Semitic incidents. In virtually every case the culprits are Muslim.</p>
<p>British media have revealed that the intelligence services have prevented dozens of terror attacks from Muslim extremists, and there have been many major exposes of English mosques where violence and intense hatred are regularly preached. There also exist several recordings of Taliban fighters speaking in strong regional accents only used by people born and raised in England.</p>
<p>There are 1.6 million Muslims living in Britain and, according to the most extensive survey so far conducted, 45% of them believe that 9/11 was an American or Israeli conspiracy. Almost 25% argue that the 7/7 attacks in London were justified because of the British government&rsquo;s involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The same number, around a quarter, believe Britain is not their country and 30% would rather live under shariah law. Twenty-eight percent hope that Britain will eventually become a Muslim fundamentalist nation and a massive 78% advocate punishment for anybody who displays cartoons offensive to Islam, such as those of Muhammad published in Denmark.</p>
<p>Similar numbers are reflected in other surveys and what is particularly obvious and repeated is how little support there is within the Muslim community for notions of free speech when Islam is allegedly mocked or even critiqued. Demonstrators in London publicly called for the Pope and leading Catholics to be slaughtered after Benedict XVI dared make reference to a question asked about Islam by a 14th century Byzantine emperor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to see how a civilized country with free education and health care, a reliable and fair police service, judiciary and bureaucracy and a tolerant culture and tradition of decency and moderation can have produced so many such people. Certainly it&rsquo;s not because they have been oppressed or denied the privileges of every other British citizen. It&rsquo;s deeply significant that two of those charged in the terror plot were converts to Islam, as were three men convicted in the United States this year of planning murder attacks on a group of synagogues and Jewish centres.</p>
<p>Nor is race an issue. Hindus and Sikhs came to Britain at exactly the same time as Muslims  &mdash;  and Sikhs, because of their distinctive headgear, probably faced the most acute racism. These communities certainly encountered problems but also enjoyed legal support and the backing of intelligent British society, which is the vast majority of people. Both groups have produced extensive middle classes and are part of the greater British fabric. As for foreign wars, British Muslims are overwhelmingly South Asian and most authorities view their alleged fraternity with Muslims in Iraq or Afghanistan as a mere pose.</p>
<p>The problems are deep, profound and disturbing. If we&rsquo;re sufficiently brave and original we have to intellectualize the instinctive and ask what many know to be an obvious question. Is this about Britain and the West or  &mdash;  however complex and whether we like it or not  &mdash;  is it all about Islam?<br>

		<p>I never got past the first &#8220;Lassie Come Home&#8221; paragraph. It made me think of my own childhood. Honest sentiments from a complete stranger&hellip; What was that line from &#8220;Killing Me Softly With His Song&#8221;?</p>

<p>Whites are the only ones who have reason to be angry but it isn&rsquo;t difficult to see why it is Non-whites in places like the UK who have an aggrieved sense of anger. The reason is there&rsquo;s a massive media campaign to keep &#8216;injustices against persons of color&rsquo; and persons of color only in the news, whether in discussions of &#8216;history&rsquo;, politics or human interest, and of course in the &#8216;news&rsquo; itself - lest whites get the wrong idea about their lands being colonized and their future being taken away. What can you do?</p>

<p> Both, let me explain. The U.K. is very rich and very weak. An attractive combination for normal men to exploit. These Islamic men are normal; therefore they have moved in, to loot and dominate the U.K. As an aside, this is what other normal groups are doing in other Western nations.<br>

		<p>Even at the end of this article the author can&rsquo;t bring himself to say that Islam is at war with the west, period. Muslims must be thrown out of England, period. Will it ever happen? One thing I can say with certainty: if they are not expelled it will mean the end of England; and eventually, not that far down the road, the end of America. </p>

<p>Yes, our white communities used to be safe, happy, and respectful. DIEversity has changed all that.</p>
<p>Today, our enemies mock our &#8216;boring&rsquo; neighborhoods. I can do without the &#8216;joys of diversity&rsquo;. Give me boring any day.<br>

		<p>What is happening in England is good news. Eventually the Brits will be forced to vote for the BNP. That government will speak out for whites and speak of the attacks on whites and encourage other whites in other countries to do the same. History will show that white consciousness started with the BNP. After that, they can deal with the BNPs socialist tendencies.</p>

<p>As someone who flies Air Canada every now and again, I completely agree with those Muslims   &mdash;   Britain is NOT your country and you SHOULD be living under shariah law&hellip;in Iran. <br>

		<p>Unless all non Whites including Non-Muslims are expelled from Europe, our problems will never be over. Muslims are showing their hatred openly. Do not assume the non-muslim non whites like us or deserve to live in Europe. </p>

		<p>Of course, Enoch Powell warned against all this in 1968.<br>
At that time Pakistanis in places such as Walthamstow were a small and meek minority.<br>
No doubt Michael coren would have been one of those who defended the pakistanis against Powell&rsquo;s &#8216;ranting and hate mongering&rsquo;.</p>
<p>MORAL: A &#8216;small and meek&rsquo; minority soon becomes a &#8216;big and bullying majority&rsquo; when a country is run by lickspittle politicians.Absolutely no quarter whatsoever or even pity must be given to the &#8216;meek minority&rsquo; the consequence is always the same.They will mercilessly destroy you.</p>

<p>That little paragraph is something that needs to be read by every Christian and Jew (and for that matter, Hindu or Buddhist) the whole world over. When anyone in the West speaks of &ldquo;good Muslims&rdquo; or that the filthy worthless cult is a &ldquo;religion of peace,&rdquo; they should be publicly administered 25 to 75 lashes and then forced to recite that litany of homicidal terror 100 times. If that doesn&rsquo;t wake them up, they should then be branded with the phrase: &ldquo;Idiotic Traitor for Islam&rdquo; on their foreheads and deported to one of the hellholes (never to return to a civilized country again, on pain of death) that is crawling with the followers of the &ldquo;prophet.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>As for the followers of the filthy worthless cult themselves living amongst us here in the West, they should all simply be placed on affordable rafts and sent in the direction of Mecca via the Pacific or Atlantic. If they make it there, fine; if they don&rsquo;t, too bad!</p>
<p>The West is in a war of survival with Islam and not one nanometer of mercy, let alone accommodation, should be offered to those followers of the &ldquo;prophet&rdquo; or their fawning lickspittle apologists!</p>
<p>May God Almighty, let it be so!!!</p>

		<p>9/11 should have been enough. Cheering and dancing in the streets right after 9/11 should have been enough. Daniel Pearl&rsquo;s murder should have been enough. Margaret Hassan&rsquo;s murder should have been enough. Cheering at the release of the Lockerbie murderer should have been enough. What will it take for civilized countries to protect themselves?<br>
Or is it that they don&rsquo;t really want to protect themselves because they are so overwhelmed by their White Guilt that they willingly allow millions of crazed murderers to infiltrate their countries?</p>

		<p>I had the interesting experience of spending two weeks in Walthamstow right after the 7/7 bombings.  Entire neighborhoods that could have been lifted directly out of Pakistan and dropped into metropolitan London   &mdash;   the sense of being an alien in the land of my ancestors   &mdash;   it was a pivotal moment in my racial awakening.</p>

		<p>6 - Daniel: Thank God for the BNP&rsquo;s &#8220;socialist&#8221; tendencies! As if we need any more rich, selfish fat cats deciding public or economic policy, enriching themselves at the cost of others. Many of them support cheap immigrant labor also in their mad quest for a world market with no economic borders. As for &#8220;socialist,&#8221; the BNP actually promotes cooperative ownership, with direct, democratic ownership by working people, both labor and middle class. This is a far cry from centralization of economic power in the national state.</p>
