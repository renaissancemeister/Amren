<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Punjabi is set to become the fourth largest spoken language in Canada by 2011 after English, French and Chinese, according to Canadian Immigration Minister Jason Kenney.</p>
<p>The minister made the announcement Friday night after inaugurating the seventh Spinning Wheel Film Festival at the Royal Ontario Museum here that will feature films by or about Sikhs. </p>
<p>More than two dozen films from around the world will be screened at the two-day festival. </p>
<p>Before opening the event, the minister unveiled two huge portraits of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his son Duleep Singh. These portraits will now be permanently displayed at the museum. </p>
<p>Lauding the contribution made by Sikhs to the Canadian society, the minister said they have thrived after their initial struggles and made a place for themselves in Canada. </p>
<p>The 2006 census showed that Punjabi is the sixth largest spoken language after English, French, Chinese, Italian and German in Canada. But it is projected to surpass German and Italian by 2011. </p>
<p>Referring to the 1914 incident when more than 350 passengers from India  &mdash;  Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus  &mdash;  were not allowed to disembark from the Komagata Maru ship and sent back to Kolkata, the minister said Canada has recognized its racist past and apologized for it. </p>
<p>Toronto-based philanthropist and physician Birinder Singh Ahluwalia, the brain behind the festival, said the aim was to showcase the rich cultural heritage of the Sikhs. </p>
<p>The Amritsar-born doctor, among most successful 25 Canadian immigrants, said the organisers received more than 120 film entries from around the world. </p>
<p>&#8220;But we are showing only the 27 best films chosen by the screening committee,&#8221; said Ahluwalia, who announced that $50,000 will be given every year to filmmakers wishing to make films with Sikh themes. </p>
<p>A huge exhibition of Sikh paintings has also been mounted at the museum. </p>
<p>Some rare paintings depict the struggle of Sikhs in the two World Wars in which many of them won the highest military honour of Victoria Cross. </p>
<p>&#8220;A Prisoner&rsquo;s Song&#8221; featuring a rare audio recording of a Sikh prisoner of war in Germany in World War I opened the film festival.<br>

<p>Canada has nothing to apologize for.  Back in the 1900&rsquo;s, it democratically took control of its future, and passed laws to restrict unwanted migrants from the Far East. The Komogata Maru violated the laws of the day.</p>
<p>Canadians of the time were concerned that firms employing Chinese and Indian migrant labor would undercut the wages and livlihoods of Canadians, as it had already been demonstrated they could.  They also wanted to continue to build the kind of country that reflected their European values.</p>
<p>Minister Kenny now owes us an apology, for slighting our ancestors, and dignifying the word &#8216;racism&rsquo; by using it in his capacity as an elected representitive.</p>

		<p>You won&rsquo;t see an ethnic film festival or art exhibit dedicated to British Canadians. Not a single high-profile Canadian of British descent could be found to serve as patron. Even worse, there is no consideration for the millions of European Canadians who abandoned their ethnic cultures to assimilate into ethnic British Canada. When Trudeau brought in multiculturalism he pulled the rug out from under our feet; we were abandoned. Shockingly there is no government guilty conscience about this.  If Minister Jason Kenney wants to make apologies that would be the most blatant racial injustice in Canada. </p>

		<p>Toronto&rsquo;s airport is more of a multicult mecca than the UN.  It&rsquo;s practically impossible to find a white person working there. So much for your &#8220;inclusive&#8221; society. </p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t call it &#8220;Toronto the Good&#8221; anymore, like they used to in the 1980s.  It used to be like NYC but without the staggering street crime.  Guess who&rsquo;s responsible for that. </p>

		<p>The Maru ship was an unwanted ship full of illegal Sikh aliens. How was it &#8220;racism&#8221; to not allow it to unload its unwanted rabble of undesirables? Politicians will say anything for a vote. Previous generations of Canadians had better sense and some racial pride. They must be turning in their graves at their meek and emasculated descendents. I could add that Sikhs are responsible for the worst act of terrorism in Canadian history, blowing up an Air India plane.</p>

<p>This is a common misconception. The US is around 65% caucasian. Caucasian isnt necessarily the same as white but all whites are caucasians. USA only about 50% white counting legal americans only. It is quite likely that the Obama administration will have an amnesty in 1-2 years. That would expand the official US population with about 10%, making whites around 45% of the population. By 2050, whites will be around 20% of the population. 30% will be various swarthy caucasians, the rest non caucasians of different kinds. So when you read news reports saying &#8220;USA will be 50% white by 2050&#8221;, then the journalist has just equated caucasian with white, which is a serious error. </p>
<p>The buzzword then will be proportional repesentation, not affirmative action for some minority crackers. </p>

		<p>At least Americans have an outlet for their racial frustrations.<br>
Conservatives rule talk radio in the U.S.   In Canada, all talk radio is controlled by multicultural-adoring leftists.   You could drive from one end of Canada to another and not hear one anti-immigration word spoken on our phone-in radio shows.  Such sentiments are forbidden.   We watch our country being swamped with Third Worlders, watch governments cater to their every need but can only voice our outrage on American websites.</p>

<p>I am well aware of the plight of British Columbia and Alberta, but Oregon, Washington, and Idaho are solidly white and demographics can change. Consider how much Southern California has changed over the past few generations. If the Mexicans can move in and peacefully colonize Southern California why can&rsquo;t we do the same in the Pacific Northwest?</p>

		<p>India, like most of the third world, continues to produce more people than their society can sustain.  Being an older country India simply has a head start on the rest of the overpopulating third world.  India is bursting at the seams with over a billion people and has set its sights on swarming the industrialized world.  If Indians are not kept out they will eventually overwhelm and lay waste to the industrialized world with their numbers as they have done to their own country.  Imagine if you will the swath of devastation a swarm of locust leaves behind in its wake&hellip;      </p>
