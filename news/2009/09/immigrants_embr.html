<h1>Immigrants Embrace Southern Living</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Franco Ordonez, Charlotte Observer, Sept. 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Carola Cárdenas left her native Venezuela twice to live in the United States. Both times she moved to cities that have long attracted large numbers of immigrants, first to Los Angeles, then New York.</p>
<p>But after four years living in the shadow of Manhattan in nearby New Jersey, Cárdenas, 36, and her husband decided to plant some roots elsewhere. They chose Charlotte  &mdash;  far away from any traditional immigrant gateway.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The family&rsquo;s story reflects the path that many immigrants, here legally or not, are taking  &mdash;  from U.S. urban enclaves filled with immigrants who share their language and culture to Southern cities like Charlotte that offer appealing and affordable suburban lifestyles.</p>
<p>A study published this year by the New York-based Center for an Urban Future found that a growing number of successful immigrants in New York are moving to Southern cities that boast a lower cost of living and a better chance to achieve middle-class goals like homeownership and sending their children to college.</p>
<p>Analysts say the trend reflects immigrants&rsquo; greater assimilation and movement up the economic ladder. It also reflects new migration patterns that have been created as large numbers from ethnic communities have spread into regions that traditionally had very little diversity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cárdenas, a membership and fundraising director for a YMCA branch, said they realized quickly that &#8220;we were not in New York anymore.&#8221; But they were encouraged to hear Spanish on the radio, see a few stores and restaurants catering to immigrants, and learn of growing numbers of Latino businesses opening that could possibly use Miguel&rsquo;s services as a graphic designer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perfecto Paredes, a district manager of Compare Foods and a native of the Dominican Republic, moved to Charlotte four years ago from New York City. He said friends from the city constantly ask him about Charlotte.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want to know about everything  &mdash;  the city, jobs, weather,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>More than a dozen uncles, aunts and cousins have followed Oscar Reto, a mortgage loan officer and a native of Peru, to Charlotte from New York since he moved here in 2001.</p>
<p>Detroit resident Roberto Sanchez travels to Charlotte often on business. He&rsquo;s long wanted to move to the region, saying the pace reminds him of life back home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The weather is very similar to Mexico,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You don&rsquo;t need as much money. People are calmer, more easygoing.&#8221;</p>
<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s Latino population has soared since the 1990s, growing more than 1,000 percent. But it&rsquo;s not just Latinos moving from the Northeast. High-tech professionals from India, teachers from Africa, and others from throughout the world are moving to Charlotte after stops in Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami.</p>
<p>More than 8 percent of Charlotte-Mecklenburg&rsquo;s 103,000 foreign-born residents moved to the area from another state in 2007, according to Census figures.</p>
<p>Such changes prompted the Levine Museum of the New South to dedicate a yearlong exhibit, &#8220;Changing Places: From Black and White to Technicolor,&#8221; to the influx of people from around the world.</p>

		<p>Just give it awhile   &mdash;   after Charlotte gets more and more Hispanics, the cost of living will go way up, and will be almost as bad as NYC and LA.  And wages will go down as a bonus.</p>
<p>About a few years ago, I read a story on VDare that linked to a story in the mainstream newspaper in Lexington, Kentucky about a Hispanic household that moved there from Los Angeles.  Among the virtues the head of household listed, adding to those stated in this article about Charlotte, she added this about Los Angeles:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s got too many Mexicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have said it better myself.</p>

<p>Yes, they so want to integrate into their new country as &#8220;Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are these the ones the fool Al GOre said cried when they saw the statue of liberty?</p>
<p>The only thing they cried about was not having enough of their old country here, but they&rsquo;ll work to change that, just as all the rest are doing.</p>

<p>So, they move away from the traditional hispanic enclaves like NY and LA and what do they find &#8220;encouraging&#8221;? That the places they are moving to are, well, turning into NY and LA.</p>

		<p> When hispanics were much smaller in number as in the seventies and eighties they targeted certain traditional enclaves to live like Los Angeles and NYC. If you desired exsposure to these exotic populations you needed to go to these places.  </p>
<p> So for a long time they were essentially bottled up but now the genie is out of the bottle and they are spreading out. What is transpiring in Charlotte and elswhere reminds me of the movie &#8220;Invation of the Body Snatchers. First they populate in concentration then infiltrate. But it&rsquo;s realy the illegal hispanic problem that caused this spark to flame and now we&rsquo;re dealing with a bonifide wildfire!<br>
 <br>
Now its us whites who seek suburban and rural enclaves in an attempt to escape all this . This tragic irony makes my blood boil.</p>

		<p>This is what happens with metropolitan areas - no assimilation (a good thing) and the eroding of a culture (a bad thing).</p>
<p>It is also bothersome that The South is getting eroded even more.<br>
Take a look at Florida.</p>
<p>I like my fellow Whites, but I prefer to be in The Southern culture.</p>
<p>Another bad thing with this is the inherit promotion of Catholicism, b/c that is what Hispanics are.  Catholicism is anti-White.  Catholicism is a business.  That is why it supports immigration, legal or not, that is non-White - they just dont care (along with most churches).  They just want members.</p>
<p>In a way it is better, b/c most Hispanics refuse to join the country, where a Know-It-All New Yorker will fit in better and erode the culture. The Yankee will DILUTE Dixie, more so often times than the Hispanic.<br>

<p>I assume mosts or all of those named above came here from chain migration.  This is exactly why, when I went looking for a foreign bride a few years ago, I looked only for the ones without a large, extended family eager to come here.  There is no one in my wife&rsquo;s extended family that wanted to come to the US that already hadn&rsquo;t, and my wife&rsquo;s only child is already a US citizen.</p>
<p>I could have brought a nice Mexican woman here about ten years ago, but I knew there would be the inevitable chain migration.  Plus, I don&rsquo;t like Spanish.  :)</p>

		<p>As a former Charlottean, I am very familiar with the newspaper &#8220;Charlotte Observer.&#8221;  They basically are guilt-ridden. self-hating  whites, and very few are actually from the local area or even the south. The newspaper photo content is at least 60% black or hispanic every day,  often more.  If you came from another country, you&rsquo;d think it was a white-minority city.  It is a thoroughly despicable newspaper.  BTW, it continues to lose circulation. </p>

		<p>Have more White Babies #13: Catholicism is anti-White? Really? Do you recall a Priest named Father Coughlin, who was the Founder of the Christian Front, and who had one of the most popular Radio Shows in the U.S. during the 1930s? You should Google his name and read more about him.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church&rsquo;s Hierarchy in the U.S. is, and has been from its conception, Irish, and now, Italian, to a lesser degree. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t all Churches seek Converts for the Faith? At least every Christian Denomiation that I know of, does. </p>
<p>And no one can deny that the Television Ministers from the Crystal Cathedral, or the Mega Churches from Texas, don&rsquo;t do a brisk business in donations, or Tythes.</p>
<p>Most Hispanics, today, are converts to the Christian Evangelical, or Pentacostal Churches, with Store Front Ministries that can be found on every block of Hispanic Neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The Traditionalist Conservative Catholics in this Country, as throughout Europe, have spoken out repeatedly against Illegal Aliens, and proposed Amnesty, as well as a further influx of non-White legal Immigration into our Country, which will only further dilute the core of our Society, and continue instead, to polarize the Nation into competing Ethnic camps. </p>
<p>An excellent resource for Traditional Catholic Doctrine can be found at the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, or TFP.org. <br>

		<p>I live in Charlotte and it has changed tremendously in the past 15 years. The Hispanic influx has been massive. Whole areas of town have been transformed, with signs in Spanish and Hispanic businesses stretching for miles. Crime rates have gone up and drunk driving deaths caused by illegals have become a common occurrence; the outrage was one huge but people seemed to have grown accustomed to it. Charlotte is a relatively clean city but the Hispanics have brought their customs of throwing trash everywhere and dumping paint in the middle of the road. Graffiti thankfully is still rare.</p>
<p>Overall though, the Hispanics are not the cause most of the problems; that dishonor still goes to the Blacks. During city events, like Fourth of July and New Year&rsquo;s, police have to show up in riot gear in anticipation for the inevitable brawls that ghetto Blacks start every year. One year over 150 Blacks were arrested. Alcohol has been banned from these events, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop Blacks from being Blacks. I&rsquo;d take the Hispanics with their problems any day over the Blacks. If only the Blacks would all emigrate to Atlanta.</p>

<p>   To share their language and culture? Boy, do you not like the positive media spin. Selfless brownies spreading their language and culture to barbarian white hicks. It is more like they did rather live among nice White people whose generosity they can exploit rather than live among their own kind who are equally exploitive. They did rather live in a clean orderly first world rural White society rather than the dirty third world cities filled with darkies. The mainstream media is a master of deception.</p>

This was told to me directly when I inquired at one in 1983.  (An club I belonged to happened to rent space there).  After, that I inquired whenever I saw a YWCA.  The policy appeared to be universal for the YWCA.<br>

		<p>#1, Question Diversity, you make some good points. Actually, what Americans across the nation need to do is study California. No speculation needed. No studies needed. California has been the laboratory on illegal immigration issues, all of them. The study is finished in California. The results are in as to what massive illegal immigration from Mexico will do to a state, namely, totally bankrupt it.</p>

		<p>Clan Chieftan:</p>
<p>I hardly think that Catholicism is anti-white.  As a matter of face, Catholicism is still a very defining institution of Western Civilization, even after the Protestant Reformation and the weakening of the Catholic Church.  That&rsquo;s why, as a Protestant, I want Catholicism (white) to do well, and to thrive.  I was happy that the Cardinals elected the former Josef Ratzinger to succeed JP II, instead of some African or Mestizo, for two reasons: (1) Benedict XVI is white, and (2) He doesn&rsquo;t apologize for Catholic doctrine.  In other words, I would rather have a Catholic Pope telling me that I&rsquo;m going to hell for not behaving Catholically than have a Catholic pope that apologizes and ecumenicalizes Catholicism out of existence.</p>
<p>That said, I think you&rsquo;re right about traditional Catholicism and race/immigration.  However, what scares me is the notion that the Priesthood has some special direct pipeline to the mind of God (I think it&rsquo;s called the Viceroy.)  Therefore, it is assumed that when Catholic Priest moves his lips, God is talking.  If Pope says A and Archbishop says B, then God is thinking A, because Pope is higher than Archbishop.  (It might not be that simple, I&rsquo;ll have to brush up on my Cathecism.)  But this means that white Catholics in Louisiana in the 1960s didn&rsquo;t oppose integration to the extent they liked to, because God was for integration, if you catch my drift. </p>
<p>And so it is today with immigration and white racial dispossession all around.  Traditional Catholicism is on our side, but if Pope and Archbishop don&rsquo;t agree with traditional Catholicism, then that means God must have changed His mind.  The most striking example was in the St. Louis Archdiocese.  Cardinal John Glennon, a segregationist, was succeeded by Cardinal John Ritter, an integrationist.  One of Ritter&rsquo;s first acts was to deseg St. Louis&rsquo;s Catholic schools.  So are we to think that God changed His mind at the very moment that Glennon was replaced with Ritter?  </p>
<p>My theory is that the Priesthood was prostrating themselves to pop politics and pecuniary concerns.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:  I was baptized into the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod.  I fell away from the LCMS, and toyed in the recent past to returning.  However, I can&rsquo;t grok the LCMS because it believes the papacy is the Antichrist.  And I can&rsquo;t grok Lutheranism in general because they&rsquo;re so fanatically anti-works that they think that believing in Christ is a work, and therefore it can&rsquo;t possibly achieve Reconciliation.  I mean, if you&rsquo;re God, and you run Moses up a mountain to receive commandments, and you incarnate a son to see him executed, resurrected and ascended, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to turn right around and say that you don&rsquo;t even have to believe in Him, nor do you have to obey His commandments   &mdash;   you can rob, rape, murder and steal all you want, I&rsquo;ll let you into Heaven anyway if I so desire.  (Where I do think that Justification By Grace Alone makes sense when you consider that it&rsquo;s impossible to sneak into Saudi Arabia and North Korea and be Salt and Light.)  Calvinism, aka Reformed, aka German Evangelical, aka United Church of Christ, takes it even further   &mdash;   God has only a fixed number of people He will let into Heaven, usually they cite a 144,000 passage in Revelation.  Though the UCC is hardly Calvinist anymore; the UCC has become a magnet for white left-wingers that also want to profess Christianity, and if you scratch the surface, the UCC believes that left-wing political ideology IS Christ and therefore IS God.</p>
<p>Where I can grok Catholicism is that innumerable charities, hospitals, agencies, and so on grew out of the need that Catholics feel to &#8220;work&#8221; their way into Heaven.  In other words, society benefits when people believe in works theologies.</p>
<p>I suppose all this makes me a Denominational free agent.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I have a feeling Southerners are not going to take this trend lying down.&#8221;</p>
<p>They already have.  There are hundreds of thousands of Hispanics in NC now and millions in across the South.  There isn&rsquo;t really any more opposition to them there than in other places.  The strongest attempts by grass roots whites to stop the Hispanic takeover have been in Long Island, NY, Northern Virgina and Eastern Pennsylvania.  </p>

&#8220;I assume mosts or all of those named above came here from chain migration. This is exactly why, when I went looking for a foreign bride a few years ago, I looked only for the ones without a large, extended family eager to come here&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of chain migration; the husband of a friend left her for a pretty Russian 25 years younger. My friend got a bit of revenge though.  Within a year of his remarrigage her EX was saddled with 7 Russian relatives moved into the house and more on the way.<br>

		<p>Question Diversity: </p>
<p>It is naturally assumed that Catholics believe that when a Priest speaks, it is GOD speaking through him. Well, no, we do not believe that. </p>
<p>The Priest is the Celebrant of the Mass, who offers the Homily, and the Gifts of the Bread and Wine, once Blessed, which then becomes the Body and Blood of Christ, and are offered to the Parishoners in Holy Communion. </p>
<p>As a Traditional Catholic, I never take the Holy Eucharist in my hands, and then place the wafer in my mouth.I Bless myself, and let the Priest put the Communion wafer on my tounge. Why? Because I am an ordinary person, not Ordained as a Priest, who has his Five Senses Blessed, during their Ordination. They are the only ones able to hold the Blessed Sacrament, of the Body and Blood of Christ, which is, again, why I do not take Communion from a Eucharistic Minister, or even a Deacon. </p>
<p>The Priest sits in the Confessional, and acts on behalf of GOD, to hear a Catholic&rsquo;s Confession of his or her sins, and then after the Penitent offers an Act of Contrition, does the Priest absolve him of his sins, through the power of the Holy Spirit, not the Priest himself, which is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The Priest will then tell the Penitent what his or her Penance shall be, in the manner of Prayers, and depending on who you get as a Priest, it can be Three Hail Marys, and Three Our Fathers, or it can be a Rosary, or Novena.</p>
<p><br>
The Pope is Infalible when he speaks about the Roman Catholic Faith. Not Buddhism, not Hinduism, not the weather, and certainly not how the Yankees are going to do in the Post Season.</p>
<p>If there is a discussion between a Bishop, Archbishop, Cardinal, and His Holiness, the Pope, it is to discuss the Doctrines of the Faith, and Canon Law. </p>
<p>All Bishops and Cardinals are subordinate to the Pope, who sits on the Throne of St. Peter, who was given the Keys to the Kingdom from Christ, and is HIS Vicor on Earth.</p>
<p>And we know that Faith, without Works, is dead.</p>

<p>Does this mean that when the Preisthood speaks up on politics, that it&rsquo;s not Divinely inspired?  If that&rsquo;s the truth, then it allays my most practical fear about the original church.  What you just said demonstrates why I need to brush up on my Cathechism.</p>
<p>Question:  I once wrote that the Pope was being a hypocrite when he said no US-Mexico border wall but the Vatican City has a border wall.  I caught Hades from a couple of Catholics, because they say since the Pope has a direct pipeline to the mind of God, it can&rsquo;t be hypocrisy by definition.  Are they right or wrong?  From what you say, I suspect they&rsquo;re wrong, because the Pope was giving a personal opinion on a political matter.</p>

		<p>#28 Question Divesity: </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct. Priests come from varied backgrounds, and when they speak on Poltitical matters, it is purely their own beliefs, not that of the Church. </p>
<p>Also note, that no Priest could, or would, use the Mass as a captive audience for his personal Political beliefs. That would be Sacrilegous. The Mass is for the Glory and Honor of GOD, not for Temporal Politics.</p>
<p>An exception to this rule would be when a Priest, or Monsignor, speaks to the Parishoners about the evils of Abortion. This is where the Sanctity of Life, and its outright abuse, and murder, has entered the Public Political forum, which is absolutely imperative for the Clergy to speak out against.</p>
<p><br>
I believe that the Pope, who did not advocate a US/Mexican border wall, did so strictly upon Humanitarian principles, not those found in Catholic Doctrine. All Nations have a Right to security, and self determination, which should not infringe upon any other Nation. </p>
<p>Mexico, and other Latin American Countries are clearly infringing upon the U.S., and its Taxpaying Citizens, myself included, which I take great exception to. I would use stronger language, but it would never get past the Moderators.</p>
<p>Mexico and other Latin American Countries imperil the U.S. Citizens with their Criminal elements, which makes up a great deal of their Illegal Alien dyaspora. </p>
<p>All Illegal Aliens, no matter where they come from, must be rounded up, and Deported, immediately, if we ever hope to regain any type of civil, and safe, Society. Then we must repeal the 1965 Immigration Reform Act. <br>
