<h1>Skin Whiteners Labeled Racist</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sara Sidner, CNN, September 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cosmetic advertisements in Asia are targeting men with blunt campaigns aimed at skin color that one lawmaker labels racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The commercials are sending a not-so-subtle message to men in Asia: Get whiter skin, and you&rsquo;ll get the girl and the job of your dreams. Or at the very least you&rsquo;ll be noticed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Jawed] Habib should know. He owns a chain of 140 salons located in India and across the world. &#8220;We Indian people, we Asian people are more darker, so we want to look more fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skin whiteners were once targeted only to women. Now the products are a hot commodity for men.</p>
<p>Many of the brands being advertised for men are well known around the world  &mdash;  including Nivea and Garnier.</p>
<p>A marketing study found sales for skin whitening creams have jumped more than 100 percent in rural India and sales for male grooming products are increasing 20 percent annually.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And Emami Ltd., the company which produces &#8220;Fair and Handsome,&#8221; sent CNN an email saying: &#8220;Fair and Handsome is a market leader with almost 70 percent market share in India and doing extremely well in Gulf countries and the Middle East as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in a country where most people have brown skin, the message being sent to men and women has some people outraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically if you need a job you have to have white skin. If you want a good partner, a companion you need white skin and you always seem to get it once you&rsquo;ve used the fairness cream. Basically I think it&rsquo;s completely racist and highly objectionable,&#8221; says Brinda Karat.</p>
<p>Karat is a member of India&rsquo;s Parliament who has made formal complaints about the advertisements to Indian authorities. She says the ads are simply playing on a social stigma that already exists in India.</p>
<p>To get a good look at the pervasiveness of the stigma attached to dark skin in India all you have to do is look at the want ads for Brides and Grooms in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Arranged marriages are still commonplace in India, and the advertisements for brides and grooms often list physical attributes of the person being sought. Many of the ads list &#8220;fair&#8221; as one of the wanted physical characteristics.</p>

		<p>Sex-selective aborticide is causing a gender ratio problem in India as well as China.  Funny how white and male is preferred everywhere on earth except American universities and HR departments.</p>
<p>(BTW, on the subject of cultural perceptions of beauty, next time you&rsquo;re in an American Chinatown, see how many ads there are for bust enhancement.)<br>

		<p>Mirror, mirror, on the wall;  Who&rsquo;s the fairest of them all?</p>
<p>The white race, which commonly substitutes &#8216;fair&rsquo; for &#8216;beautiful&rsquo; as one and the same word, is not alone in its thinking.  It&rsquo;s ludicrous to call something racist when every race on earth thinks the same way.  The word they are really looking for is &#8216;beautyist.&rsquo;  Curse all those people, all over the world, who still discriminate against ugly people in favor of beautiful people every second of their daily lives.  If not for them, the worker&rsquo;s paradise of rainbow kumbayah singing would be right around the corner.</p>
<p>After the leaders of world opinion have struck down the awful discrimination people have for beauty over ugliness, they will have to target &#8216;truthists,&rsquo; who value the truth over lies, and &#8216;loveists,&rsquo; who value the people they love over those they don&rsquo;t.  Eventually all preferences will be submerged into a giant formless gray sea of non-judgmentalism and non-discrimination, which will be the first time everyone can breathe easy under the bright new dawn of true equality on earth.</p>

		<p>Human nature - whites get tans to be darker, Indians use cream to look lighter, blacks straighten their hair.  And women all over the world (and men in some cultures) use makeup and jewelry to enhance their appearance.  Not to mention cosmetic surgery!</p>

<p>Fair/white skin is considered attractive in both the genders in nearly all cultures. </p>

		<p>Here we can clearly see the root of much anti-White hatred.  They long for what they can never have, and hate those of us who have come by our fairness without effort.  It&rsquo;s just not fair!</p>

		<p>If several Celtic languages &#8216;fair&rsquo; (light in color, or milky-white) and &#8216;beautiful&rsquo; are indeed the same word, and in one other instance the light-colored word is the same as the &#8216;equitable and even-handed decision-making&rsquo; meaning of &#8216;fair.&rsquo; Imagine a tall, handsome, light-eyed Nordic Viking striding into a squabble and sorting out what&rsquo;s what&hellip;</p>

what about blonde hair dye? Colored contacts? </p>

		<p>What about hair relaxers? They seem to be all the rage in the &#8220;black community.&#8221; Ask Whitney or Oprah or LaToya if these products are racist. Why aren&rsquo;t afros in style anymore? Why do blacks want to emulate the hair of whites?</p>

<p>They did have an entire program on Oprah about this very subject. Seems some university professor wanted to find the universal ideal of beauty. It was observed that the ideal woman from a beauty standpoint was a white woman with long hair and a slight Asian slant to her eyes.</p>
<p>This professor said that he was surprised by the results. And so was Oprah and her mostly black audience. Oprah and her chosen few all said that the test must be rigged in some manner and that the persons interviewed for the study had be coaxed or cajoled or paid into making the statements that they did. The results were &#8220;cooked&#8221; from the start was what they were saying.</p>
<p>[this test was done planet wide, universal with all sorts of people participating, Oriental, Africans, whites, American Indians, etc., all types!]</p>
<p>The professor said NO, that all sorts of concerns had been addressed before the various participants to the study were interviewed as to their views of what &#8220;beauty&#8221; consisted of! This test was as fair as it could be made and the observations consistent without question.</p>

		<p>So, the author refers to skin whiteners as racist, but doesn&rsquo;t refer to skin darkeners as racist.  Sounds like SOMEONE is an in-the-closet anti-white racist.</p>
