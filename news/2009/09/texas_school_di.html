<h1>Texas School District Turns Away Students From Mexico</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mayra Cuevas-Nazario, CNN, September 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For years, children from Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, have attended schools across the border in Del Rio, Texas, but this week that changed for students who cannot prove residency.</p>
<p>The local school superintendent imposed new regulations to stem what he said is a long-standing problem for the district.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen van loads of kids with plates from Coahuila State (in Mexico) pulling in front of the school,&#8221; San Felipe Del Rio School Superintendent Kelt Cooper told CNN. &#8220;Everyone knows what is going on. It&rsquo;s real blatant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cooper, who joined the district 11 months ago, previously was superintendent in the border town of Nogales, Arizona, where he had to deal with similar circumstances. There, he remembered, he once had 32 students with the same home address. When district officials checked, the property was a vacant lot.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Border towns are really unique,&#8221; Cooper told CNN in a phone interview. &#8220;There is a lot of fluidity between the two cities. Having grown up in the border, I know this is very common.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, Cooper received confirmation from authorities at the International Bridge border crossing that some 540 school-age kids were crossing the bridge in the mornings.</p>
<p>Cooper said the situation was &#8220;getting out of hand,&#8221; and on Wednesday he dispatched district staff members to the bridge to talk to the parents accompanying their children from the Mexican side. The staff was able to identify 195 students that could be barred from the district&rsquo;s schools if they failed to provide proof they lived within the district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To prove residency, the district requires parents or guardians to provide an official document such as a utility bill, lease or proof-of-rent payment, none of which Gomez said she can provide since everything is in her sister-in-law&rsquo;s name. She said her only alternative may be homeschooling her children.</p>
<p>Cooper said he knows some of the parents who received letters are upset, especially those with children who are U.S. citizens. But he said the issue is a matter or residency, not citizenship or immigration status.</p>
<p>&#8220;Citizenship is a moot point. It really comes down to whether you live here,&#8221; Cooper said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frequently, they (Mexicans) come with the impression that their kids are U.S. citizens, so they can go to school here,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not U.S. Border Patrol, Customs or INS. If you are a resident here, you get to go to school here, if you don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t. This is not a matter of border enforcement.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I thought I would post this here, for no specific reason, because everything it seems at Amren concerns the decline of the country to third world status.<br>
Check this out at Youtube: The Future is Asia. It is self-explanatory; maddening and amusing at the same time. I think I hate these two guys, yet they are simply being honest.<br>

		<p>Good for the superintendent. Your school district needed you years ago, Mr. Cooper. I hope that other districts will follow your example. This is another insanity that can be found in this country. This is one of the perks Mexico feels they are entitled to. It gone on so long, that they will be highly insulted that their &#8220;rights&#8221; have been abridged.</p>

		<p>Well, if I live in mexico and I knew the US would not control its borders and I could cross and get everything I wanted handed to me for free I would too!  This is the only country on the planet that can not and will not control its own borders. Says a lot for our administrations doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>Americans are daily witnessing the disrespect, that foreign nationals have for the U.S., because of the many traitors we have. </p>
<p>&#8220;They just drive across the border to attend school.&#8221; </p>
<p>Again, Americans have been asleep to the point of being an irrelevant, non-entity in their own nation, and these foreign nationals know it.</p>

		<p>This is common sense solution to an obvious problem. Now there remains a much more serious and expensive problem: noncitizens who attend US schools even though they do live in the district. The idiotic Supreme Court case caused this. It will never be overturned while the Obamas reign and the Dems run the Senate.</p>
<p>Billions are spent to educate foreigners.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s pretty sad that the English skills of the Hispanic US residents that do attend that school are so bad that it is virtually impossible to tell when Mexican children sneak in to the classroom posing as Americans.  I&rsquo;m guessing that the student body of that school is 100% Hispanic.  Might be wrong, but I&rsquo;d be surprised if it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If we cannot afford to operate Hospitals close to the border, perhaps we cannot afford to operate schools close to the border.</p>

		<p>Why does this surprise anyone? The so-called &#8220;border&#8221; is so nonexistant that the Mexican Army regularly &#8220;gets lost&#8221; and is found patrolling (or maybe spying?) miles inside the United States. There should be a strictly forbidden No Man&rsquo;s Land between the filthy, south-of-the-border towns and American cities, with any commerce between the two carefully and rigorously controlled (by border patrol agents who are allowed to actually DO their jobs). All Mexican nationals found attending American schools should be prompty expelled and not allowed to return for any reason. We need to slam the border tightly shut at least until we can root out most or all of the illegals already here and get them deported. After that we could take stock and decide if or how many Mexicans we want to let in and when.  </p>

		<p>Just as money is power, the lack of money eviscerates the oppressor. Amren&rsquo;ers would be wise to claim every government hand out and avoid every tax they are legally entitled to. Claim it before a third world-er comes here to steal it. </p>

<p>When I first heard about Mexican parents sending their children to schools across the border, I wondered why they were even bothering. According to the most recent test scores, U.S. schools are now just as bad as Mexican schools.  </p>

		<p>This happens all the time in schools located on the Mexican border.  I believe, in Texas a school district derives funds for students in the district but is not funded for out of district students.  I guarantee, if this school district was receiving state funds for these students living in Mexico the district would be sending busses to the country of Mexico.  Also, school funding procedures vary per state concerning the education of illegal Mexicans (some border states pay schools a unit value to educate illegal Mexicans).</p>
<p>The crux of the matter is that we need to completely focus on the European American/Aryan.  Within our community, what must motivate all issues must revolve around what is best for the European American/Aryan; nothing else.    <br>

Maybe the parents are sending the kids to American schools for something other than an education (gang-related business??).</p>

		<p>The Mexicans in Mexico send their kids across the border to the US schools for the same reason most Mexicans (and other mestizos) send their kids to school: daycare and free breakfast and lunch. It has nothing to do with education at all. Nothing. The latinos here in L.A. don&rsquo;t care about schooling. They have higher drop-out rates than blacks and their test scores are as bad and in fact worse than blacks in some areas. But they and the blacks are the soldiers that our enemies hope to use against us. </p>

Duh!  The Alaska-Russia border is covered with water or ice&hellip; depending on the season.  <br>
It&rsquo;s so easy for the Mexicans to get into Texas, Arizona, whatever&hellip;  If we REALLY wanted to stop it, we could&hellip;  Makes you wonder why we don&rsquo;t&hellip;  Could it be possible that &#8216;THEY&rsquo; have an agenda??</p>

		<p>I am sick of the constant  drum beat spewing out anti-Mexican bunk. We stole half their country. We went to war with them because of a weapons of mass destruction hoax. Lincoln, himself, said he would lead a congressional expedition to find the spot that the Mexicans were supposed to have entered Texas. We have turned their border towns into gigantic open air drug markets and whore houses. How many of you vets will admit to going to Boy`s Town every time you had a 48 hour pass?<br>
     Mexico has never taken a dime of US tax payer aid. I would trade all of Florida`s 750,000 Cubans and 2 million Neo-Ricans from NYC for 1 good Mexican. A Mexican will work his behind off. I know the LA gangs are pretty bad; however if I was a Mexican kid and had to put up with black and Asian posses I`d be in El Norte myself. Mexicans won`t let anybody migrate without first passing a morals and Spanish test. Mexico has less than .05 % non white or non- Meztiso citizens. Rather than bash their culos maybe we should be learning a little racial purity from them.<br>

		<p>When I lived in Los Angeles, some of the more responsible Mexicans would send their kids to private schools in Mexico. Los Angeles schools are nothing but war zones, and working class Mexicans could easily pay for Mexican private schooling while the kids lived with grandparents, etc. California pubic school systems used to be the best in the world. The schools have decayed so badly that even Hispanics cannot survive there with their own people. </p>

<p>Mr. Tiffany, do you really know what goes on South of the border? to include the Central American parts and the Northernmost parts of South America? Those places are bigger, more deadly war zones that Iraq and Afghanistan combined and I&rsquo;ve been in all of them.</p>

<p>The schools are gang zones today. They are not off limits like they were in our parent&rsquo;s day to the gangs. The gangs are EVERYWHERE in California a state that is now 51% latino.<br>
