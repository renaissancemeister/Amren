<h1>Toronto&rsquo;s 1st Africentric School Set to Open</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBC News (Toronto), September 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Tuesday, when hundreds of thousands of Ontario students head back to school, a lot of attention will be focused on one particular school in Toronto&rsquo;s north end.</p>
<p>It only has 85 students, but hopes are high for the Africentric Alternative School, which will open its doors near Keele Street and Sheppard Avenue West on Sept. 8 for the very first time.</p>
<p>The administrative staff, the teachers, the parents  &mdash;  even the kids  &mdash;  are excited about the new school.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m going to learn how to write the A, B, C, Ds,&#8221; says Makeba Ofori-McRae in anticipation.</p>
<p>When Makeba enters Grade One she wants to &#8220;learn how to write the numbers. Then I&rsquo;m going to colour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mother, Amma, says she enrolled Makeba in the Africentric school so her daughter would be taught about her black heritage.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just something that they&rsquo;re going to be learning,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with separating. We&rsquo;re still going to be around other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Toronto District School Board voted narrowly to approve the controversial school in January 2008.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an attempt by educators to combat the disproportionately high dropout rate among black students in the Toronto school system.</p>
<p>Thando Hyman-Aman, the principal of the Africentric school, is adamant the children will learn the same curriculum as all other schools in Ontario.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same reading, the same writing, the same mathematics will be there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What makes this school look different are the culturally relevant resources that we use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those resources include textbooks such as The Kid&rsquo;s Book of Black Canadian History or a story about 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, who is from Kenya.</p>
<p>&#8220;We definitely want to nurture a sense of belonging and community, but we also want to make sure that our standards are very high  &mdash;  where students can read, write, speak, clearly and perform very well,&#8221; said Hyman-Aman.</p>
<p>Leah Newbold, the school&rsquo;s French, health and phys-ed teacher, is also excited about the new school.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that the students in our communities are brilliant, and I want to be part of a school that&rsquo;s helping them to demonstrate that  &mdash;  and that&rsquo;s leading them to be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school is still accepting new students for the fall, and the principal says it is getting inquiries every day.<br>

		<p>This is just like the South African scenario. After the ANC takeover much propaganda about the &#8216;racist&rsquo; low standard of education given to blacks.  All schools opened to all races &amp; guess what the standard of education at all schools had to be lowered to help the blacks cope. So everyone now has a lower standard of education except those that can afford private schools writing foreign examinations.<br>
The standard of education is now lower than during the the years of white rule &amp; heading even lower. The ANC of course do not want education for the masses.<br>
So you people in Canada build as many schools for those with lower learning abilities as you can &amp; don&rsquo;t complain or you will have to lower the standards in your state schools &amp; everyone will suffer.</p>

		<p>There were virtually no blacks at all in Toronto until the 1960&rsquo;s when the treasonous Liberal party started letting them in. They contribute absolutely nothing and have only been a source of trouble, tension and crime since the moment they arrived here. For example in the 1950&rsquo;s, when the city was all-White, Toronto averaged FOUR homicides a year. Now the Jamaican gangbangers do that in a weekend.</p>

		<p>A country with no history of slavery, with basically a recently imported Afro-population is experiencing the fact that, unlike white and asian children, blacks can not succede in a standard educational environment.  I wonder what the black Canadian crime rate is compared to other ethnic groups?</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t the regular schools &#8216;Afrocentric&rsquo; already? I&rsquo;ve yet to read an article or textbook, History or otherwise, claiming something like &#8220;Whites doing great&#8221;, &#8220;white unemployment the lowest&#8221;. Even where there is a large population of Asians, and whites are &#8216;at the bottom&rsquo;, the focus is still and always on non-whites.</p>
<p>What they mean to say is, Toronto schools are not &#8216;Afrocentric&rsquo; enough. </p>

		<p>First blacks insisted on getting into white schools. Now they want to separate themselves from whites (and others) in the vain, fervent hope that segregation will somehow boost their test scores. It won&rsquo;t. And the school is sure to deteriorate real fast. From what I&rsquo;ve seen, blacks can only live in a civilized society/environment if they&rsquo;re the distinct minority and whites are the definite majority. A majority black population does not do well&hellip; just check out Africa.</p>

		<p>Somehow I bet the dropout rate will not go down. Despite what they say this is voluntary segregation. But they cannot compete academically in white schools..maybe this will be better.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll bet the dropout rate will not decrease in this school, either. Once these kids and their parents get over their initial excitement about learning an African-oriented curriculum, reality will surely set in, quickly. That&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;ll realize that their people haven&rsquo;t accomplished anything that could possibly occupy a child&rsquo;s education for twelve years. You could teach all of Afro-history in one semester, and still run out of topics long before the semester ends. Then what will they teach? </p>

		<p>While it is quite obvious that this will be another failed experiment, it is actually a better option then now. It&rsquo;s basically reintroducing segregation. If this idea could be pushed furthur, we could very well start seperating the different races into different communities so that they don&rsquo;t mix. Maybe even recreate the eurocentric school system just as these other races systems come into being. The only problem is, they&rsquo;ll likely only teach that the white people are the problem in that school but that may very well make the race problem more visable to white people and will need to be dealt with. I am Canadian and I approve of this system.</p>

		<p>#5 Poster asks &#8220;<i>I wonder what the black Canadian crime rate is compared to other ethnic groups</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re too political-correct to keep racial crime statistics, but most Toronto cops on the street will say about 80%-90% of violent crime can be attributed to Black males. Almost every shooting involves a black male and 2009&rsquo;s murder rate stands at 40 killings to date. Proportional population numbers place Toronto Blacks at slightly over 8%, so it would appear just the &#8220;young, black males&#8221; who represent 2% or 3% (??) create an awful lot of crime in Toronto. These are mostly imported 1st &amp; 2nd generation Blacks from the Caribbean Islands having arrived since the 1970s.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s because they never heard of the 100% graduation rate of the school in Ontario for blacks where the main subjects are selling dope, talking a little jive, the history of rap and rap artists, and pulling a little slack.</p>
<p>But you have to give Toronto credit for offering courses that will be useful in getting recruits immediately if they ever get serious about starting an insurgency group.</p>
<p>And it will create more jobs for law enforcement as well.</p>

<p>The lack of schools or even classes anywhere that teach any sort of white culture or European cultural heritage as such is why both Canada and the U.S. is committing suicide.  They have lost their way.  The schools stopped teaching all those things done by &#8220;Old Dead White Men,&#8221; when they were stripping curriculums down during the 80s and 90s.  Since then, the crash of our nations have excellerated, seemingly by powers of ten.</p>

		<p>I really appreciate Graham&rsquo;s  insights based on the South African experience. My initial reaction to the report was to see this as a shameless pandering and concession to &#8216;the Community.&rsquo;  But Graham rightly notes that this voluntary segregation might remove those students who would otherwise perhaps disrupt the educational experience of European-Canadian pupils.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these Afrocentrist pupils will be educated and prepared to return to their  &mdash;  I borrow their phrase  &mdash;  &#8220;culturally relevant&#8221; countries where they can take up their place in nation building. </p>

<p>Firstly Istvan, there is no such thing as a &#8220;black Canadian&#8221;. There are NOW blacks living in Canada but they are NOT &#8220;Canadians&#8221;. As to the black crime rate it is very, very high, especially violent crime (much of it seemingly senseless). Almost every day papers in Toronto have stories about black shootings, etc. The worst of all seem to be the Jamaicans.</p>

		<p>I used to live in Seattle and they opened up the &#8220;African American Academy&#8221; there a few years ago, a public school for blacks with the exact same stated goals and reasons as this one in Canada.</p>
<p>This year, the &#8220;African American Academy&#8221; closed, officially due to &#8220;cost-cutting measures&#8221;, along with some other schools in Seatle.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an article about the school closings, including the &#8220;African American Academy&#8221;:<br>
https://tinyurl.com/lsa9sn</p>
<p>What this article fails to mention is that the Seattle Public Schools&rsquo; &#8220;African American Academy&#8221; also had the worst academic performance level of all the schools in Seattle Public Schools system.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from an article on KOMO news that is more truthful:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/ns5vlb</p>
<p>&#8220;Citing budget concerns, low academic performance and dropping attendance Seattle Public Schools decided to close South Beacon Hill&rsquo;s African American Academy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is the citydata.com page about the now-closed &#8220;African American Academy&#8221;.  They gave it a rating of 28 out of 100:</p>

<p>If you enjoy reading comments from befuddled and clueless multicult Seattle liberals scratching their heads wondering what on Earth went wrong with the &#8220;African American Academy&#8221;, then you might find the link above rather entertaining.</p>
<p>All that said, I personally feel that blacks should be allowed if not required to have their own schools, and I think these schools should be allowed to have the most dismal test scores and performance levels possible, without the fear that they will be closed.  Give them their own schools and let them fail all they want, because at least then our children will not have to deal with them at school.</p>
