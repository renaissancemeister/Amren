<h1>Out-of-Work Undocumented Migrants Seek End to Crackdown</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ivan Mejia, Hispanic Business, September 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of undocumented workers who recently lost their jobs are asking the government to stop taking a &#8220;hard line&#8221; on immigration policy and to offer a solution to the desperate situations of many of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re demanding that (President Barack) Obama stop the application of a hard line on existing immigration laws,&#8221; Nativo Lopez, the head of the Mexican American Political Association, told Efe.</p>
<p>Lopez said that more than 2,200 undocumented workers recently have been fired from several manufacturing firms in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of the people don&rsquo;t know it, but Obama has the executive discretion to put a stop to the verification of employment documents, E-Verify, and the sending of letters of Social Security discrepancies,&#8221; the activist said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the companies that laid off workers is American Apparel, a clothing manufacturer that is pushing a campaign supporting immigration reform on T-shirts with the message in English &#8220;Legalize LA&#8221; and which this month will lay off 1,500 workers from whom the government is demanding proof of the validity of their documents.</p>
<p>Marina Andrade, American Apparel&rsquo;s representative, told Efe that &#8220;the workers are like our family and it affects us greatly to think that they&rsquo;re not going to have (money) to pay the rent or for food. Therefore, we&rsquo;re asking President Obama to quickly approve immigration reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the government is doing is as if it were cutting off our arms,&#8221; Esther Hernandez, 32, one of the workers dismissed by American Apparel, told Efe.</p>
<p>Olga Casta√±eda, 39, said that the firings are a sign of &#8220;the oppression of the labor that the country needs by the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alexander Auerbach, a member of the board of directors for frozen food packing firm Overhill Farms, in southern Los Angeles, told Efe that the Internal Revenue Service conducted an audit of payrolls for 2006 and found that out of 1,000 workers 260 had inconsistencies in their documents.</p>
<p>Because of that, last April the Social Security Administration sent letters to the employers informing them that some of the Social Security numbers of their workers were invalid.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government was telling us that these people are not here legally and, therefore, we, the company, like the workers, were going to face legal action,&#8221; Auerbach said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the people have been with us for many years and have experience in the job that&rsquo;s to the countries advantage, but the lawyers recommended that we fire them because if we did not do that we would have had to pay millions of dollars in fines or go to jail,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the only solution is in Obama&rsquo;s hands and the only thing he can do is fulfill what he promised us Latinos in the campaign, that is to say immigration reform,&#8221; he [Marcelino Arteaga, one of the Overhill Farms workers who was laid off] said.<br>

		<p>How ironic is it that there is so little support for amnesty that the illegal aliens working to make amnesty T-shirts get laid off?  I fail to see how granting amnesty will make their lives any easier, because nobody will be asking for it anymore, and not buying T-shirts showing off their support for it, if it happens.  At least for another 20-30 years.</p>

		<p>With this next batch of illegals made legal and the minority of white men who vote liberal along with the majority of white feminists and the prior minorities, we are done as the majority.</p>
<p>There maybe no way to reverse the damage done by the massive inflow of immigration. It has turned the tide against the pro white majority.</p>
<p>The only hope we may have left is to turn the few remaining states were whites hold the majority into independant states. Thats about it I think.</p>

		<p>This illegal criminal is demanding, demanding mind you, we give him and his band of freeloading invaders citizenship and welfare. No gratitude in this man&rsquo;s heart that he and his band of scofflaws haven&rsquo;t been shot on sight which would be reasonable.</p>

<p>How nice&hellip;sending some Happy Face letters to inform them that THEY ARE COMMITTING IDENTITY THEFT!!!!!</p>
<p>There should be no letters, only a set of hand-cuffs with a cop attached.</p>

		<p> No Mr. Arteaga, the only solution is NOT in Obama&rsquo;s hands. Another solution is for you to get out of our Country, where you are not wanted or needed. Go back home.</p>
<p>As to the fellow who said that these illegals job experience is to the Country&rsquo;s advantage, what he REALLY meant to say is that these illegals are to OUR company&rsquo;s advantage, as they work for low wages in poor working conditions with no benifits, and we can easily keep them in line because they know we know they are illegal. Nobody is buying these excuses anymore fellow, so give it a rest already.</p>

		<p>All these &#8220;sneak into USA and live here&#8221; types would bother me far less if stuff like cans of green beans &amp; tubes of toothpaste, etc. weren&rsquo;t emblazoned with foreign non-English writing.  Obviously the businesses that make these products want to cater to non-Americans to increase sales.  Anyone know when this bilingual packaging started?  I would say, the mid 90&rsquo;s.  Irks me.</p>

		<p>We can only hope that the American government listens to them about as much as it listens to its own legal citizens.</p>

		<p>To #2, I have a feeling a civil war/revolution or race war will break out in the future and that&rsquo;s not what anyone wants, not even most of us who visit this site.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t even know why they bother demanding amnesty anymore, they already are in LA, a Latino majority sanctuary city where they don&rsquo;t have to bother learning English, can access government services and have virtually no chance of being deported.  All being a citizen would mean to them is having to pay taxes and occasionally getting called for jury duty. Why do they bother?</p>
