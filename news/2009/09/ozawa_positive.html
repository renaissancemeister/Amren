<h1>Ozawa Positive About Granting Local Voting Rights to Non-Japanese</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kyodo News, September 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Democratic Party of Japan Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa says he will try to take the issue of giving foreigners local voting rights to next year&rsquo;s regular Diet session.</p>
<p>In a meeting with South Korean lawmaker Lee Sang Deuk in Tokyo on Saturday, Ozawa told Lee he favors granting local suffrage to permanent residents of Japan, including South Koreans, participants said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want it to take form somehow during the regular Diet session,&#8221; Ozawa was quoted as saying, suggesting he intends to compile the opinions of DPJ members during the session.</p>
<p>DPJ Upper House member Yoshihiro Kawakami, who took part in the meeting, said he believes the DPJ-led government will submit a bill aimed at giving permanent foreign residents the right to vote in elections for local government heads and assembly members during that Diet session.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who doubles as DPJ president, said in August before his party defeated the Liberal Democratic Party that while there are arguments for and against the idea within the DPJ, the time has come to consider it in a positive light.</p>
<p>But bringing it to the Diet may not be easy because Kokumin Shinto (People&rsquo;s New Party), one of two junior ruling coalition partners of the DPJ, has expressed its opposition, saying granting suffrage to non-Japanese could destabilize the nation.<br>

		<p>Enfranchising non-citizens in the expectation that they will be permanently beholden to the party in power is a short-sighted strategy. In order to sustain such voter loyalty, the party in power needs to cater to them using the public purse. Since this is a matter of spending money from someone else&rsquo;s pocket, other parties can challenge this by cutting similar deals with the non-citizens. </p>
<p>Another consequence would be that enforcement of laws against guest workers and illegals would be weakened. A disproportionate amount of crime in Japan is caused by those there illegally in addition to the Korean permanent residents. </p>

		<p>This a surprising turn of events. I&rsquo;ve been reading about the new prime minister and ruling party and had felt that they would be a good thing for Japan. They are fiscally conservative and true free marketeers. They wanted to move American military out of Japan and reassert their independence and influence on the region. I feel this is a good thing, because the US needs to tend to its own affairs, not try to supervise affairs in east Asia, especially as we go bankrupt as a nation. I&rsquo;m not sure about this stance on voting rights for non Japanese though. The numbers of resident foreigners is very low, but this seems to be a step away from Japans normally very nationalistic approach.</p>

		<p>It used to be that you could depend on Japanese leaders to publicly utter politically incorrect statements from time to time about the changing demographics of America,  but apparently they&rsquo;ve learned to keep their mouths shut in the proper PC fashion.   You can&rsquo;t really blame Japan for pulling away from a soon to be third-world U.S.,  though the efforts of the present Prime Minister might be a little premature.   As for this issue,  most of the foreigners involved are Korean, I don&rsquo;t see Japan engaging in any real multiculturalization any time soon,  even though leftists now control the government. </p>

		<p>Some in in Japan needs to check out this guy&rsquo;s background with a microscope. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they found globalist skeletons in his closet. </p>

		<p>Wow, this is great news.  The Japanese are almost completely western!  We have finally civilized them.  I might even live to see a Somali-Nipponese Crown Princes!  Or dare I dream&hellip;a Somali Emperor?<br>

		<p>Interesting, can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m too suprised though. The DPJ made election promises bordering on lunacy.  Japan doesn&rsquo;t have a hundredth of the available funds for what they were proposing to give to the Japanese people if they won.</p>
