			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexander Burns, Politico, Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former Vice President Walter Mondale has joined his old boss Jimmy Carter in arguing that some of the opposition to President Barack Obama&rsquo;s agenda is fueled by racial animus. </p>
<p>Asked at an event in Washington late Wednesday whether he agreed with the former president that racism was behind some criticism of Obama, Mondale took a long pause before answering: &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t like saying it,&#8221; Mondale continued. &#8220;Having lived through those years, when civil rights was such a bitter issue, and when we argued those things for years, &hellip; I know that some of that must still be around.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to pick a person [and] say, &#8216;He&rsquo;s a racist,&rsquo; but I do think the way they&rsquo;re piling on Obama  &mdash;  the harshness  &mdash;  you kind of feel it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think I see an edge in them that&rsquo;s a little bit different and a little harsher than I&rsquo;ve seen in other times.&#8221; </p>
<p>At a screening of a new documentary on his life, &#8220;Fritz: The Walter Mondale Story&#8221; at George Washington University&rsquo;s School of Media and Public Affairs, the 1984 Democratic nominee for president lamented what he called a coarse tone in political life today, telling the audience: &#8220;It&rsquo;s been discouraging to watch this health care debate.&#8221; </p>

								<h2>Black Lawmakers Adjusting to Political Realities</h2>
						<p>The euphoria over President Barack Obama&rsquo;s inauguration is giving way to political reality for African-American lawmakers as Democrats grapple with stubborn challenges facing a long-awaited domestic agenda.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Questions remain about how hard Obama can fight for the anti-poverty, education and health care proposals that helped him win near-universal support from black voters. There also is a growing realization that he will likely face years of criticism  &mdash;  some of it motivated by race  &mdash;  over his administration&rsquo;s response to a sour economy and other issues.</p>
<p>Some in the CBC acknowledge Obama must govern more from the center to be a successful president. However, many of the group&rsquo;s more liberal lawmakers expect him to seize the opportunity created by strong Democratic control of Congress to push through initiatives that have long been blocked by Republicans, such as public health insurance and sharp funding increases for urban development.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We want him to stand strong,&#8221; said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.</p>
<p>In a conference call recently, Obama reminded CBC members that most of them represent politically safe districts, and that Democrats must look out for the interests of vulnerable moderates to maintain majorities and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>The CBC conference draws thousands of elected officials, business leaders and other professionals from around the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many attendees said they remain incredibly proud that the nation elected a black president and are optimistic about the future, despite the economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for the first time probably in the history of America the black community feels they are in a position of power,&#8221; said James Bryant, a union leader from San Francisco. &#8220;I think African-Americans think there is no more wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bryant and others said they anticipated that Obama would face fierce resistance from the right. But some said they don&rsquo;t understand the intensity and sometimes personal nature of the opposition.<br>

<p>What a crock. The same elderly 60s 70s gang now in power are complaining of the &#8220;harshness&#8221; of political discourse today. Now that this bunch is in power, their memories seem to overlook their behavior during their violent revolutionary years.  To say their behavior was &#8220;harsh&#8221; belies the issue, and it would make light of history.</p>
<p>Just as was predicted then, the day would come when these people would want to stop the world they were creating so they could get back to having political discourse in manner that dead White men intended. Just as was also predicted, that&rsquo;s unlikely to happen.</p>

		<p>I said this as soon as Obama looked as though he&rsquo;d beat Hillary for the Democrat nomination:</p>
<p>Sensible white voters of any political stripe would vote against Obama because electing to the presidency a man who, by racial birthright, is relatively immune to criticism is a Bad Idea.</p>
<p>The media isn&rsquo;t mature enough to handle a president of black or part-black ancestry (that&rsquo;s a kind way to put it).  When they grow up (by no means an inevitability), this objection can safely be removed.</p>

		<p>Anybody who lets this obvious chidish psychology worry them is a fool.</p>
<p>The comeback to that is that Obama and his supporters are self-hating whites or anti-white black racists.  That&rsquo;s why they think everybody else is a racist.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t defend.  ATTACK! </p>

		<p>And there is a racial edge to affirmative action and non-White immigration as well.  What sort of response does he expect when the country&rsquo;s rulers turn against their people?  Mondale is an old hack trying to masquerade as a statesman.  He supported minority hiring for the State Department, and then complained about their lack of foreign language skills, insisting that more money would help.  Just an old fool.  <br>
   <br>
Still, anything that sharpens racial awareness is good.  The people that oppose BHO for his policies can be brought to see that race is at the root of it.</p>

		<p>I have come to the conclusion that it is better to admit racism on all sides and get it over with. NOTHING is ever going to stop the charge of racism on the part of Whites no matter what they say or do. Just admit that racism is a matter of one&rsquo;s people of survival period. It is ingrained in every human for a reason. It is only Whites that have been deceived (brainwashed) into thinking that racism is an evil that has to be done away with. It will never happen. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a false pride, based on white guilt, manipulation of public sentiment, lowering of standards, quashing of freedom of speech, and an enormous structure of hypocrisy and double standards (blacks are &#8220;proud&#8221; of black achievements but always attribute the reverse, white pride in their own achievements, to &#8220;racism&#8221;).</p>

		<p>And if race did play a role in white opposition to Obama what difference would that make? As if blacks, up to and including our own FDR Jones in chief, don&rsquo;t dine out on race and racial resentment every day of their lives. Maybe Obama&rsquo;s just an incompetent president. Did you ever think of that Mondale? Is a possible for a liberal to hold a black man accountable for anything? </p>

		<p>again, my apologies for lack of capital letters and certain punctuation.</p>
<p>we all have a bit of built-in racism. i think i heard jared taylor once say that it is part of instinct and is a protective mechanism. it&rsquo;s innate, immutable and normal; it&rsquo;s a survival-of the-species-mechanism. it exists in all races and non-whites practice it the most. some of this i&rsquo;m about to say we all know, but it deserves repeating for me to make a point. <br>
whites have been manipulated by propoganda and other &#8221;brainwashing&#8221; techniques by the anti-white liberal media. at age 56, i don&rsquo;t recall being taught that whites were evil in school. this was before integration was forced on us. i didn&rsquo;t not go to school with blacks until high school and even then only by what was called &#8221;freedom of choice&#8221;. under this method from the late &#8216;60&rsquo;s, blacks were free to choose to go wherever they wanted. just a few came at first. later the naacp decided to get bolder and send more to our school until after about 5-6 years the black school was done away with and all were melded together. in our area of the country it still resulted in around 30 percent black and 70 percent white. <br>
before i digressed, the point i was trying to make was that as young children, we weren&rsquo;t taught to hate our own race. the communists hadn&rsquo;t seized control of the public school system yet. <br>
now here we are 40 years of forced integration later and are in many ways more divided than ever. everyone knows the phenomena of &#8221;lunchroom segregation&#8221;, where whites, blacks and hispanics when present will self-segregate.</p>
<p>let me say in summary, i think many whites voted for bho to &#8221;cleanse&#8221; themselves of any vestiges of possible racism and rid themselves of &#8221;white guilt&#8221;. most whites that voted for obama did so for racial reasons regardless of all the &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo;<br>
non-sense they&rsquo;ll tell you. i think at this point, many, if not most of the naive white ideallists realize the nature of their error. this is not the &#8221;change&#8221; they voted for. they realize they were duped. obama ran from the center/left and is now obviously governing from the hard left and plunging us deep into debt. we&rsquo;ve bred a sense of entitlement into particularly young blacks. it was as if money falls from the skys, but it&rsquo;s &#8216;rainier&rsquo; in white neighborhoods. now they feel like it&rsquo;s time for a weather change. they don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to succeed as a race, but they feel like they&rsquo;re overdue for their slice of the pie, whether they earned it or not. <br>
that said, no matter how badly obama wrecks the economy, they&rsquo;ll still vote for him for a second term. whites, regardless of whether or not they admit it, i think have been awakened and seen a side to obama that they refused to admit existed before the election. i believe the professor gates/officer crowley incident tilted the scales and revealed to them the real obama. some were so naive pollyannas. i tend to believe most of them will not vote for barry the next election as their instincts are in the end stronger than the liberal in-the-sack-for-obama media tells them. </p>

		<p>There was at least as much hate and vitriol directed against George W. Bush (not that it wasn&rsquo;t deserved).  Strangely, nobody ever said that the non-whites who criticized Bush were driven by racism.</p>
<p>The reality is that except for neocon Fox News all the major media outlets favor socialism, big government, and anything non-white, and they&rsquo;re just flabbergasted that not everyone sees things their way.</p>

<p>So opposition to Obama is &#8216;racist&rsquo;?<br>
Who cares, with this admission now common knowledge?</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually- as they tell us- the term &#8216;racism&rsquo; is now UTTERLY devoid of meaning: &#8220;We call things racism just to get attention. We reduce complicated problems to racism, not because it is racism, but because it works.&#8221;  &mdash;  - Alfredo Gutierrez, political consultant, as quoted by Richard de Uriarte, The Phoenix Gazette, March 14, 1992 (quoted in The Pro English Advocate, 1st quarter, 2002).&#8221;</p>

		<p>You know, I think these two simpletons, Carter and Mondale, are doing a great service to help raise the racial consciousness of White people.</p>
<p>Why? Because quite frankly everyday, average, non political American Whites are sick unto death of hearing the whining of &#8220;po&rsquo; black me&#8221; and charges of rascism whenever any of even the most innocuous of legitimate observations is made about black behavior, let alone any type of disagreement or criticism of this or that black.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering WHY the media and Obama think bringng out the two most incompetent, ineffective, lame political figures in the 20th century is going to persuade anybody of anything.  Those two got everything they ever did or said WRONG, and were rejected by huge landslides.  Moreover, they had the most corrupt presidency of any, with many of their appointees being indicted and convicted of various felonies.  It&rsquo;s like Carter asking his 12 year old daughter Amy what to do about the nuclear problem, or YOU asking the village retard how to invest your money.</p>
<p>I am happy to see the beginnings of the White push-back on this obvious ploy of shouting racism at every turn.  White politicians are refusing to apologize for calling stupidity and duplicity for what it is.  White cops are refusing to apologize for a black professor&rsquo;s bad (innate) behavior.  And whites in general are SICK AND TIRED of being called racists when they point out that the man who mugged them, raped their daughter, invaded their home, or murdered a loved one was black with NO remorse, and that blacks are the most criminal amongst us.</p>

		<p>One way of dealing with the bogus charge of racism is to turn and attack back on another level altogether.  When AG Eric Holder said that Americans were too cowardly to talk about race, we counter-attacked and said, &#8220;Obama &amp; Holder are too cowardly to talk about rape.&#8221; We sent that line to many, many people in and out of government.  </p>
<p>There is something like this that can always be said about &#8220;rapism&#8221; whenever we have to listen to &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What these libs like Mondale don&rsquo;t seem to grasp is that Obama is without a doubt, one of the most left-wing presidents in US history, most white Americans do not like left wing policies, and that that is what is driving the vast majority of the opposition.  And these fools choose to overlook the fact that the other Democratic leaders, such as Nancy Pelosi, get just as much flack from conservatives as the president.</p>
<p>These lefties would do well, for their political good, to reassess the strategy of attacking white Americans by calling all disagreement with them &#8220;racist.&#8221; More and more I see white folks in this country saying enough is enough, we are sick of being branded as racists when we just want the right that all others seem to have of being able to speak our minds about what we believe in.  Even though the % of whites in America is lower than it has ever been, we still represent a solid majority of the population, about 200 million out of 300 million, so it won&rsquo;t be anytime soon that the Democrats can write off the white vote.  If they keep this up the 2010 mid-term elections results could be very surprising to them.</p>

		<p>Appearence does matter, when designed by nature&hellip; the cover often tells of the contents. Healthy white people would prefer to be represented by their own. On the continent of Africa when given the chance black people voted with their feet to leave their black ruled provinces and move to white ruled South Africa. As we can see there is no shortage of African blacks ever seeking to infest Europes shores where there is also&hellip;. white leadership, not to mention white women&hellip;. It seems black behavior indicates some inconsistancy here,&hellip;. they love their black figure heads as long as these figure heads can be suppoted and maintained by a legitimate white infrastructure.</p>

		<p>  So criticism of President Obama and his policies is racist? I have opposed the policies of the last three presidents. We live in a Republic founded on the distrust of government.

		<p>The difference between the &#8216;harshness&rsquo; towards Obama (and Bush) vs Clinton and Carter is the existence of the Internet, not racism. Like somebody else mentioned - Pelosi. Is criticizing her some kind of white on white racism then? I don&rsquo;t think so. No, transparency is much, much greater now for politicians and people are able to communicate in a way never seen before in history. People got on the net and discovered that majority of people out there are not ultra liberals. Pre-Internet you only had the mainstream media for information and they had you believing everyone but yourself was a liberal. Yes, the Internet was around during most of the Clinton years, but a much smaller % of the public was on it compared to now. </p>

		<p>Yea, fine. I&rsquo;m a racist. I want complete separation of my people, because Obama represents the spearhead that is the genocide of Whites. Yes. I admit it. I don&rsquo;t like him because he is black, and his blackness represents the decline of the people that I love so dearly. I&rsquo;m sure he is a perfectly nice guy, intelligent and caring and a good father, but I see him for what he is, and for what the Marxist media lauds him to be. </p>

		<p>It is useless to argue that one is not racist, especially when one is.  Just say, &#8220;So what? Does that mean that Obama is not incompetent, inexperienced, Marxist, white-hating, and America- hating? Racist or not my arguments are still valid so let&rsquo;s discuss them.<br>
Another response is to point out black coruuption, brutality, criminality, and incompetence around the world and that you would be an idiot not to be racist.<br>
I like this one to those who say I don&rsquo;t like Obama just because he is black:  If Obama were not a left-wing radical and <br>
Marxist whose only experience has been community organizing, who hates America and is bent on destroying her militarily and economically, who hates whites, may not be a citizen, and who advanced through affirmative action, etc. then your charge might be true. But as you can see I have many other valid reasons to dislike him. Plus he gives me the creeps. And YES, I believe black rule is a disaster.</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t you glad you didn&rsquo;t vote for this guy Mondale as our next President back in 1984?  It was morning in America, I tell you.</p>

		<p>Does anyone here really believe that Mr. Obama is running things?<br>
He is a trained bear dancing to the tune of all those scary guys whom he &#8220;appointed&#8221;.  Does anyone believe that? They chose him because of his oratorial skills. He gets up before the mics and the cameras, neither of which he ever met one that he didn&rsquo;t like, and he recites the script he has been given.</p>

		<p>Remember how this guy inadvertently revealed his true agenda and his disrespect for his own supporters?</p>
<p>He was being video taped at a campaign rally, with throngs of cheering supporters, when he was unaware the mic was still turned on, and he said to an aid nex to him&hellip;&hellip;as he laughed  at the cheering crowd&hellip;&hellip; &#8220;Look at them!&#8221;  (Laugh) &#8220;We&rsquo;ll tax their asses off.&#8221;</p>
<p>How in God&rsquo;s name anybody could have supported him after a remark like that is absolutely astounding and reveals just how doggedly idiotic the lefties are when it comes to supporting their radicals.</p>
<p>With an electorate so dumb, it&rsquo;s no wonder we get the incompetents in office we do.  </p>

		<p>I think this article made some interesting points, I read a textbook directly related to this topic, its called Language, Discourse and Power in African American Culture by Marcyliena Morgan, I found my used copy for less than the bookstores at http://www.belabooks.com/books/9780521001496.htm</p>

		<p>Those who call you a racist are those who believe they have the right to abolish your right to like and dislike whomever you choose.  The nezt time someone calls you a racist ask them what is it exactly that you should like about blacks&hellip; </p>
