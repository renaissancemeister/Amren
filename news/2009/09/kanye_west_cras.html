			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jayson Rodriguez, MTV, September 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This year, Kanye West picked the beginning of the Video Music Awards to deliver one of his famous rants.</p>
<p>The rapper stormed the stage just after the first award, for Best Female Video, was presented to Taylor Swift. He cut the teen singer off, grabbing the mic and protesting in support of Beyoncé.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the 2007 VMAs in Las Vegas, West delivered another rant and lost his temper after he was displeased with his performance being set inside a hotel suite rather than on the show&rsquo;s main stage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His protest against Swift, however, was not well received. West stood briefly on the stage after his comments as the crowd was silent. Audience members then began to clap in support of Swift after West left the stage.</p>
<p>According to reports from inside the house, once cameras cut away from the action, West flipped off the crowd and returned to his seat. Wale then said to the crowd, &#8220;You can&rsquo;t blame a man for speaking his mind.&#8221; His words were met with boos, {snip}<br>

		<p>Again, more evidence of what most of us already know. There must have been something in the air that day. Just look at the uncivilized behavior of Serena Williams the same day. What Pink probably doesn&rsquo;t realize is that this rant was probably more about race than anything else. He doesn&rsquo;t hate Swift because she&rsquo;s a woman, but because she&rsquo;s white. And another thing: I thought 1) that Connie West was a country-western singer and 2) that she was dead.</p>

<p>Well, we already know this guy is anti-white, so does it surprise anyone (at least on Amren) that he would stoop so low as to dim the spotlight on this very talented young woman, Taylor Swift?</p>

		<p>Par for the course with spoiled Black celebreties. If you watch the video you will see that poor Taylor Swift looked like she was about to cry but managed to keep her composure and perform not too much later in the program. He will get by unscathed since he &#8220;apologized&#8221; to the girl&rsquo;s mother. As usual, the white people involved will be gracious and West will look like the idiot that he is. </p>

		<p>Kanye&rsquo;s drunkeness brought out the true black attitude; basically that of a two year old.  They see something and they want it.  Private property rights, justice, morality, compassion, delayed satisfaction, have no truck with the black mind.  I&rsquo;m surprised Kanye did not try to rape Taylor Swift right on staage.</p>
<p>At least Beyonce behaved graciously, calling Miss Swift back to the podium, much to the approval of the audience.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that MTV would even give an award to a country music artist.  My older brother who was a teen in the 80s used to watch it back then.  But these days they don&rsquo;t play many music videos and what they do have, my brother says they might as well be called &#8220;NTV.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m sure you can guess what he means.</p>

		<p>Serena Williams and Kanye West&hellip;hmmm, what other high-character joys will the wonders of diversity bring us? </p>
<p>Nothing will come out of the Serena Williams affair. In a flurry of effeminate &#8220;moral highroading,&#8221; tennis authorities will blather on about using Williams&rsquo;s violent outburst as a &#8220;learning experience&#8221; or some other such weak-kneed drivel.</p>
<p>As for Taylor Swift however, country music fans seem to be far less, how shall I say&hellip;multicultural? For whatever reason, rural whites seem far more willing (on the whole anyway) to stand up for themselves. </p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a stretch to narrowly equate country music with rural life, but I think my fellow posters get my point. </p>

		<p>This is similar to Serena Williams&rsquo;s outburst of a few days ago.  When a certain class of blacks think they deserve it, but they don&rsquo;t get it and some white person gets it instead, they throw a fit.  To Beyonce&rsquo;s credit, she was up next and focused on Taylor Smith.</p>
<p>But this goes to show you how far country music has fallen, that today&rsquo;s country &#8220;singers&#8221; can easily cavort with foul-mouthed black &#8220;hip hoppers.&#8221;  That concept would have been unthinkable in the 1960s, or even as late as the late 1970s.</p>

		<p>One news source I read about this incident called this low life a &#8220;rap singer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can somebody help me?  Since rap is nothing more than bad poetry that never makes a lot of sense, usually attempting to point out something that blacks are delusional about, where does music enter into the picture?</p>
<p>One of the greatest points of degeneration in this country today is the fact that that a no-talent black can be called a singer just for running his mouth.</p>

		<p>Yeah that Kenya West should not be allowed to access the stage. What he did was shockingly rude (pull up article and view video).</p>
<p>Though Beyonce won an award a while later and she actually said the first VMA award is a big deal, and Taylor deserves her moment, she called Taylor Swift onto the stage so she could have &#8220;her moment&#8221; uninterrupted.</p>

		<p>Conspicuously missing from any mention in this article is the &#8220;fashion accessory&#8221; Kanye West was seen with prior to his boorish behavior that nowadays seems to be typical of blacks in the spotlight.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2009/09/video-kanye-west-sips-cognac-pre-outburst" rel="nofollow">http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2009/09/video-kanye-west-sips-cognac-pre-outburst</a></p>
<p>Thus, West is not just a lout, but a drunken one to boot!</p>
<p>Miss Taylor Swift, ever the lady, refused to go anywhere near his level.  To her credit, Beyoncé at least had the decency to look mortified during the incident, and afterwards invited Taylor Swift on stage to complete her speech.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/09/14/taylor-beyonce-immediately-reached-out/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmz.com/2009/09/14/taylor-beyonce-immediately-reached-out/</a></p>
<p>Kudos, however, go out to Bizarro world singer/songwriter Alecia Beth Moore (aka Pink) for this:</p>
<p>&#8220;During the next commercial break, Pink walked by the rapper and appeared to shake her head in disgust before security escorted her away.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read elsewhere that shortly afterwards, she twittered her fans, giving them her spot on opinion of West (which due to commenting guidelines, can&rsquo;t be printed here).</p>
<p>In the end, however, all of this will mean nothing.  That is because this type of behavior is tacitly encouraged, as long as it&rsquo;s done against Whites, and Miss Taylor Swift has the misfortune of being a White musician in an ever-darkening music world.  Sadly, art does imitate life.</p>

		<p>Most Whites have the delusional idea that the more that blacks are &#8220;integrated&#8221; into the society, then the more polite, civil and respectful they will become.  The pinnacle of this supposed metamorphosis is the ascendancy of a black president.  At this point, all of America&rsquo;s sins are supposed to have been washed away, and blacks and Whites will live side by side in harmony.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>Race realists know better.  As blacks feel more at ease to &#8220;be themselves&#8221; in modern society, their true nature is becoming increasingly apparent.  This is why, in every conceivable social measure of success and stability, blacks perform more poorly today than they did fifty years ago.  As Whites sheepishly look to integrate and placate, blacks are increasingly more brazen and strident in their tribal instincts.  They see our weakness and how we are always willing to lay prostrate before them, and they feel confident in their ability act out with impunity.  Yes, I know it&rsquo;s just a stupid dumb stunt at a stupid dumb awards ceremony where a black man selfishly grabs the microphone from a White in order to promote another black who didn&rsquo;t deserve the award.  But little things like this can speak volumes.  How many blacks want to secretly grab for themselves the things you have rightfully earned?</p>

		<p>I abhor MTV and the destruction it has caused not only to Western Civilization but to the entire world. There&rsquo;s no such thing as &#8216;White Flight&rsquo; when pathological ghetto culture can be beamed directly into your living room. Just look at the contrast in civility and class between &#8220;Kanye&#8221; and Swift!</p>
<p>When I read about this and viewed the video, I was steaming angry. I am SICK and TIRED of the inexusable and pathological behavior of blacks. This incident came on the heels of Serena Williams threating to KILL an umpire (an Asian woman) over a questionable call, and another incident a couple of weeks ago when a black running back from Oregon sucker-punched a White player. And these were only the incidents on-camera for everyone to see! I&rsquo;m sure there were countless other off-camera incidents as well!</p>
<p>I hope this incident FINALLY becomes a turning point for Whites and other non-blacks and that they wake up and realize that this type of behavior is NOT &#8220;cool&#8221; and that black &#8220;culture&#8221; is pathological, not to be mimicked and start taking pride in their own heritage and culture. Enough with political correctness!</p>
<p>We should boycott &#8220;black&#8221; events and support White ones:<br>
STOP watching and going to NFL games.<br>
STOP watching and going to NBA games.<br>
DO NOT allow your children to watch MTV or buy ANY hip-hop music.</p>
<p>The list could go on and on, but I hope I&rsquo;ve made my point.<br>
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!</p>

		<p>i apologize for no cap&rsquo;s or some types on punctation d/t a bad keyboard.</p>
<p>this is a good example of what i have always maintained about young, testosterone-ridden, low intelligent black males i.e. they take action, many times on impulse and doing harm without thinking of the consequences. our jails and prisons are full of them. thank god they finally nailed o.j. <br>
 <br>
the internet is hot with this story and even liberal sources like rolling stone magazine don&rsquo;t slant their stories in support of this punk. i went to youtube to get a glimpse of the video but it had been taken down due to some sort of copyright infringement with viacom.<br>
thankfully america was able to view that part of the awards show on &#8216;the o&rsquo;reilly factor&rsquo; and &#8216;hannity&rsquo;s america&rsquo; tonight monday sept. 14. what i saw was a bully of a black thug - who apparently always gets his way - snatch the microphone away from an humble white child as she was giving her acceptance speech. a mere girl of 19 won a video award - by popular vote - and she was enjoying one of the highest peaks in her young life and this talentless black punk stold it from her. seems he thought beyounce, a young black star should have gotten it. of course we all know race had nothing to do with his favorite.<br>
 <br>
after his outrageous outburst, he was roundly booed by a largely white liberal audience. there was only so much time alotted for this so taylor&rsquo;s acceptance speech was cut short and her bubble bursted. i understand that the white artist &#8216;pink&rsquo; glared at him to the point of intimidation and of course she, not kanye, was escorted from the building for her behavior. this after west flagged the audience &#8221;the bird&#8221;, further crashing taylor&rsquo;s moment.</p>
<p>as a side note, the camera footage showed beyonce&rsquo;s reaction as kanye was delivering his rant. she was smiling as if she thought it was somehow harmless at least and funny at worst. when she saw how negatively the crowd reacted, she rushed to taylor&rsquo;s side later on in the show. my guess is that she made the decision to do this on the basis of how it would affect her own career&hellip;knowing full well the audience was watching her reaction. she had lost the award to taylor anyway and has already establihed herself as a star. afterall, what did she have to loose and had everything to gain by her support of taylor. maybe i&rsquo;m wrong, but just a thought in light of more growing black solidarity every day. <br>

		<p>Those of you giving kind words for Bouncy or whatever her name is, the mulatto, should note that she is grinning in the audience while that guy West is ranting on stage. Obviously both of them hate White people.  It must be terrible for her to compete in the real world with someone as beautiful as Taylor Swift with her fake hair, thick makeup and skin bleachers.  The tone of her skin seems to change every time she&rsquo;s in front of a camera.</p>

		<p>I was furious when I saw that beautiful and gracious 19 year old girl, treated that way on national television by ranting childish, 32 year old media whore like Kanye West. He has been spouting off like this for years now, and for once it finally blew up in his face. You know he crossed the line, when Beyonce made it clear she was against how he acted, and I do give her credit for it, and thought it was a classy move on her part. But what really convinced me he crossed the line, was when he Obama called him a jackass.</p>

		<p>&#8220;as a side note, the camera footage showed beyonce&rsquo;s reaction as kanye was delivering his rant. she was smiling as if she thought it was somehow harmless at least and funny at worst. when she saw how negatively the crowd reacted, she rushed to taylor&rsquo;s side later on in the show. my guess is that she made the decision to do this on the basis of how it would affect her own career&hellip;knowing full well the audience was watching her reaction. she had lost the award to taylor anyway and has already establihed herself as a star. afterall, what did she have to loose and had everything to gain by her support of taylor. maybe i&rsquo;m wrong, but just a thought in light of more growing black solidarity every day. &#8220;</p>
<p>White minds think alike.  Many people rushed to say Beyonce acted graciously but her smiles said &#8220;Kanye are you tripping?!?  Brotha I luv u but my career comes first!&#8221;</p>
<p>All of these blacks acting out have me wondering if all of the well behaved blacks are constantly conflicted.  They have to act white and deny their natural black &#8220;essence.&#8221;  That can&rsquo;t be good for their health.  <br>

		<p>Mulatto artist Beyoncé did have the decency to invite back White artist Swift after Black artist West&rsquo;s shameful act, something she deserves some credit for. However, I suspect that the main reason she did it was because unlike West she was smart and sober enough to realize that even White Hollywood liberals were disgusted by West&rsquo;s behavior, meaning that she probably did it to score points, not because it was the right thing to do. </p>

		<p>Miss Swift got a hard lesson that I hope serves her well. I hope she quickly understands that this is how most black males act when the guard is down( drinking in this case).<br>
Beyonce did show grace and I am sure she was mortified being thrust into this ugly incident.<br>
But, that does not nullify that it has gotten to the point where a black thug can walk out onstage and assault a pretty white woman with no ill effect. I assure you Wests&rsquo; street cred went way up with the brothers.<br>
I hope all white teenage girls learned a good hard lesson..your black male friend at school hates you and it will show when he has reason to be jealous.<br>
When you cheer him on the football field he hates you when you score high on the SAT.And will say you got into the elite school because you were white. <br>
MISS Swift he hates you because you are White, intelligient,pretty and successful.   </p>

<p> I am disgusted that he had the selfishness to assault Miss Swift in her moment, but I am not surprised.  The best thing for her and all other whites is to avoid dealing with these punks and lowlifes. MTV is a white sellout-pro black thug organization, and as such, something I avoid at all costs.</p>
<p>  Deep down I think Wests resentment stems from Swift&rsquo;s talent, beauty and whiteness. He felt the need to tear that down as best his drunken impotent self could. Beyonce at least demonstrated some class by trying to patch this rift up. Good for her and Taylor Swift. </p>

		<p>This comes from years and years of being allowed to do whatever the hell they want and not having to take any responsibility for their actions.  If the roles were reversed and Swift was black and West was white, how long do you think it would have taken for security to come out on stage and escort him off and he would be forever banned from the awards show.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, these award shows are totally useless and just another venue for a bunch of spoiled, singers and celebrities to pat each other on the back about how great they are and worship the idol.</p>

		<p>I agree with those who say that this is a result of years of blacks being allowed to do whatever they want.  One example I witnessed recently:  Some white friends, at a party full of whites, mentioned that they&rsquo;d gone to Disneyland recently and a group of &#8220;kids&#8221; had brazenly pushed ahead of them in line for one of the rides.  All the people at the party were indignant.  &#8220;You should have reported those kids!&#8221;  &#8220;Disneyland kicks people out of the park for line-jumping!&#8221; etc.  Then the victims said, &#8220;Well&hellip;they were black.&#8221;  Silence for a few seconds.  Then the people at the party started saying, &#8220;Oh.  That&rsquo;s different.  Well&hellip;you did the right thing.&#8221;  &#8220;Yeah, they might&rsquo;ve been gang members and had other friends there.  If you&rsquo;d reported them, they might&rsquo;ve waited for you when you got off the ride and beat you up.&#8221;  So in other words, if the &#8220;kids&#8221; jumping in line had been white, well, then, hold them responsible and punish them!  If they&rsquo;re black, then better not make waves.  Better to just shup up and turn the other cheek.  Yes, cutting in line is a minor incident, but I think similar things, minor and major, happen all the time, while cowed whites tremble in their boots and do nothing.  Every time it happens, blacks are emboldened.</p>

<p>Absolutely not! If that were the case, than Taylor Swift would have been more deserving of an Academy award for best actress. You could clearly see the awkwardness she felt, she was shocked and humiliated, and stood there like a deer in the headlights, after he indulged in his childish rant. She literally did not know what to say, or do after that. But I admired her poise none the less, since she kept her emotions in check rather admirably for a teenager who is new to the lightlight.</p>

<p>Whether or not it was to save face, I can&rsquo;t say? I do know Beyonce&rsquo;s father, who is also her manager, was said to have approached Taylor backstage to offer his apologies as soon as the incident took place. Beyonce&rsquo;s husband is Jay Z, and probably signs Kanye&rsquo;s paychecks. So, it could look like pandering, if they didn&rsquo;t distance themselves from him at that moment. Either way, it was a wise move on Beyonce&rsquo;s part to handle the situation as she did.</p>

		<p>I noticed Kanye bounced onstage the instant she announced she was a country singer, and wondered if he also disliked her for that as well. In his eyes, only hip-hop and rap(by black artists of course)are relevant. He would probably be shocked how many young white people admire Taylor Swift, which I discovered only recently, on Youtube, there were countless young people on there complaining about how shabbily she was treated, and giving her the thumbs up for her victory. Surprisingly, this was true of many non-whites as well, including some blacks.</p>

Of course, Bouncy was forced to kill her in the end,  in self-defense.</p>

To those correctly identifying Kanye&rsquo;s behavior and general mentality as being on the level of a 12 year old, let me remind you that in 2006 TIME Magazine did a drooling cover story on West which called him &#8220;The Smartest Man in Pop Music.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes folks, TIME Magazine   &mdash;   NOT &#8220;Vibe&#8221;, &#8220;Ebony&#8221;, &#8220;The Final Call&#8221; or some other black publication. </p>

<p>Thank you.   Exactly!   This extends from  rowdy disruptive behavior in the  classroom,  then into the workplace,  and even onto the stage in front of national television. They are impulsive, irrepressible,  wild and uncontrollable.  And it&rsquo;s all tolerated as&hellip; &#8220;well, you know, that&rsquo;s just the way they are&#8221;.</p>
<p>It should NOT be tolerated.  And once upon a time it wasn&rsquo;t.    But they are given a free pass, since no one wants to be accused of &#8220;racism&#8221;.   And THEY KNOW THIS!  They know they can get away with it, and so they do.</p>

<p>Personally, I have never been a fan of Beyonce&rsquo;s music, either as a solo singer, or when she was with Destiny&rsquo;s child. Quite simply, her voice does not appeal to me. Having recently listened to Taylor&rsquo;s music, I will admit, I was somewhat underwhelmed by her voice, as well. But her videos, and the lyrics to her music are surprisingly innocent and sweet for this day and age, which is refreshing after years of Britney, and the like. What impressed me most though, is that she writes her own music. For a young girl, not even out of her teens, to have come this far so young, truly is impressive. I will say one thing for both her and Beyonce, and that is they both conducted themselves with class the other night, unlike Kanye.</p>

		<p>All I&rsquo;ve noticed about MTV is that when it started out, almost 95% of the bands presented in videos were white. And were so for about 4-1/2 to 5 years. Then the complaints started. Within 24 months, the &#8220;network&#8221; flipped to the point that the majority of videos presented were from black performers. Rap music dropped 35% in sales in &#8216;07, another 30% in &#8216;08 and has been plummeting again this year. Yet MTV still presents rap as its main music staple. </p>
<p>I mention all this because of the stories coming out now from former MTV employees etc. who allege the &#8216;complaints&rsquo; about MTV being &#8220;too white&#8221; were false flags, coming from forces within Viacom itself.  Apparently the people behind the scenes felt they had captured the white audience, and it was now time to work on them, set them straight, as they had with the parents of the kids years earlier, using Archie Bunker and George Jefferson. Seems plausible, given the fact that a no-talent like Kanye West still receives air-time. This when people also allege some sales figures are manipulated to make it appear as if certain artists are more popular than they are, doling out money simply to keep a useful idiot front and center, in the hopes that whites and blacks will emulate him for different reasons. They hope the whites will emulate his ignorance and lack of respect for white culture, and they hope the blacks will emulate his disdain for whites, period. Keep in mind the complaints about MTV being &#8220;too white&#8221; in the 80&rsquo;s came at a time when less then 15% of blacks and hispanics had cable TV.</p>
<p>In the end, all Kanye does is reinforce many of those &#8220;negative&#8221;, supposedly false stereotypes that have &#8220;dogged&#8221; the poor blacks for who knows how long. None of these stereotypes are actually based in fact, are they? That&rsquo;s as silly as believing MTV would create false controversy in order to adjust their programming in an attempt to brainwash white youth, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>&#8220;To show you how phony and screwed up our values are and how far we will go to elevate the black thugs and punks around us, the next night he was on Leno.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got tons of media coverage out of this, he got showcased on the Leno show, and now a lot of people have heard of him who never did before.</p>
<p>As they say, &#8220;there is no such thing as bad publicity.&#8221; </p>

		<p><i>as a side note, the camera footage showed beyonce&rsquo;s reaction as kanye was delivering his rant. she was smiling as if she thought it was somehow harmless at least and funny at worst. when she saw how negatively the crowd reacted, she rushed to taylor&rsquo;s side later on in the show. my guess is that she made the decision to do this on the basis of how it would affect her own career&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Beyonce was smiling  - but it seemed more a smile of bemusement, she may have initially thought that Mr West&rsquo;s stage rush was part of some pre-arranged act, as one could quite naturally do, and played along to humour it. It did not seem she approved of West&rsquo;s actions at all. The black guy sitting behind her was clearly unimpressed.</p>
<p>Kanye is obviously a spoilt celebrity - but to be truthful his behaviour while appalling, was no worse than that of many white celebrities, rock stars, movie stars etc, who throw phones at hotel staff, assault reporters, trash hotel rooms, and trip out on cocaine.</p>
<p>It is the spoilt celebrity culture, and those who buy into it, who are to blame. If you let your kids watch MTV, or become infatuated with celebrity culture, you are partly to blame yourself. Get them into Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms - great men, and true cultural heroes. Get them into chess, and science, and great literature. Also sports (but not celebrity athletes).</p>
<p>Which was, paradoxically, the kind of thing the Soviet Union use to assiduously cultivate  -  they promoted the best of Western civilization - and lauded chess grandmasters, concert pianists, and scientists, while our contribution was Michael Jackson, and rap and hip hop. I sometimes wonder who historians, in the final analysis, will declare the true victor of the Cold War.</p>

<p>That was one of the most pained smiles of &#8220;bemusement&#8221; I&rsquo;ve ever seen!  Watch the video again, in slow motion.  As soon as West utters her name she mouths the words &#8220;Oh my god!&#8221; and then reflexively sinks her head somewhat into her shoulders, as if she were trying to hide.  She knew what had just happened and was clearly mortified.  </p>

<p>The &#8220;smile&#8221; she had on her face is not uncommon on people (especially women) who find themselves in clearly embarrassing situations, and don&rsquo;t know what to say or do.  I&rsquo;ve seen it happen numerous times.  Unlike that drunken fool West, she had enough brains to be embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The black guy sitting behind her was clearly unimpressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>True.  Did you notice he mouthed the word &#8220;Wow&#8221; as if thinking to himself: &#8220;What an idiot!&#8221;  Not all blacks are crass boors, just enough.</p>

		<p>This morning I was walking by a black guy who was on his mobile phone.  I clearly heard him say, &#8220;Dude!  Just because he says it&rsquo;s a white man&rsquo;s sport doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s racist!&#8221; I think some of the blacks are as sick and tired of racist baiting as the rest of us are.  Kanye West was disgusting that night and opened the eyes of a lot of Taylor Swift fans.  I think Beyonce may well have been mortified by his behavior, and not condoning it, like the guy on his phone today.</p>

		<p>This blog, not only confirms Kanyes ignorance but half of society as well. You cannot judge a race based on one individual. Those of you basing Kanyes statement on the whole black race are just as ignorant as he is. From a black woman&hellip;.</p>
