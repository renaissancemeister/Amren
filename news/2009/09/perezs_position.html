<h1><a href="https://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/18/perezs-positions-give-pause/">Perez&rsquo;s Positions Give Pause</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Washington Times, Sept. 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sometimes there is more than one good reason for a slowdown. That&rsquo;s the case when it comes to Thomas E. Perez, the nominee to head the U.S. Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division. </p>
<p>Mr. Perez is the Maryland secretary of labor. His resume  &mdash;  two graduate degrees from Harvard University and a previous staff role in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department  &mdash;  looks solid on paper. {snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Perez&rsquo;s record involves more than just his curriculum vitae. He has served as president of the board of CASA de Maryland, an immigrant-advocacy organization known for taking several rather extreme positions. For instance, CASA has fought against keeping illegal immigrants from getting state drivers&rsquo; licenses. Mr. Perez himself has supported efforts to grant in-state tuition rates to undocumented immigrants. And he has been a strong proponent of giving preferential treatment to members of some races or ethnicities in admissions to schools to train health professionals. </p>
<p>On that latter point, Mr. Perez argued that racial preferences could be used not just for &#8220;remedial&#8221; purposes  &mdash;  not just to make up for past discrimination  &mdash;  but to meet other social objectives as well. </p>
<p>{snip}[F]or a division already being turned by the Obama administration into a veritable hotbed for providing legal cover for racial grievances, Mr. Perez&rsquo;s cornucopia of leftist positions should give senators pause. He should not be confirmed without a full and open airing of all these issues. <br>

		<p>Maryland&rsquo;s current governor, Martin O&rsquo;Malley, perfected the political ploy of pandering to Hispanics. The theory goes that blacks are far too fractured and self-devouring to pose any usefulness in political campaigns. </p>
<p>Where it was once necessary to secure the black vote in Maryland politics, it&rsquo;s now more profitable to prostrate oneself before the Spanish speaking interests. Blacks are so busy destroying one another that they can&rsquo;t be relied upon to vote in a predictable fashion. </p>
<p>Hispanics on the other hand are rapidly outnumbering blacks, and they are far more robotic in obeying a racial alignment. Thus, it&rsquo;s no surprise that an unrepentant, overtly biased CASAbot like Thomas Perez would ascend to the epicenter of Snivel Rights administration. </p>

		<p>This is exactly what I expected, he is empowering non whites and removing all whites from positions of power.</p>
<p>If he succeeds to gain absolute power with the illegals granted citizenship than we are doomed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why the liberals are so blind and they don&rsquo;t see it, they don&rsquo;t understand that once he gains absolute power, all whites will be meaningless.</p>
<p>I recomend for liberals to study a little bit of history about Russia and Eastern Europe countries.</p>

		<p>CASA de Maryland also threatened to stalk and harass the children of Maryland Minutemen at their schools back in 2006.</p>
<p>Although Perez has recently distanced himself from CASA de Maryland and its radical, Marxist director, Gustavo Torres, his wife and in-laws are still active donors.</p>

		<p>I guarantee that 95% or more of the Democrats will approve this nomination and that more than enough worthless Republicans with follow along so that Perez gets his position.  It&rsquo;s Sotomayer all over again.</p>
<p>This shows why, despite my dislike of the vast majority of Republican politicians, I can never vote under any circumstances for Democrats.<br>

<p>I understand it.   To answer your question: Obviously, they do not expect that this will apply to them!</p>
<p>I would think that&rsquo;s very clear   &mdash;    that they have no such expectation.  Does David Axelrod [for example] fear that he&rsquo;s going to lose any clout?  No!  If anything, it will be enhanced. They will feather their own nests while they sell out the rest of us. </p>
<p>Now, it may not go that way, and they could get a big surprise. But that&rsquo;s clearly not what they&rsquo;re placing their bets on.</p>

		<p>A key vote to expose who works for the hispanic lobby in the Senate. This is as simple a vote as you will get: vote for this guy, you want preferences for hispanics over whites, both legal and illegal hispanics. </p>
<p> Some Republicans will vote for him; they should be targets in every primary they run in and their fundraising efforts should be attacked.</p>
<p> If blacks had brains they&rsquo;d oppose this guy too, but that is too much to expect. Blacks have let their young people stay untrained and unemployed as hispanics take over entry level blue collar and service industry jobs.</p>

<p>This is exactly what has happened and what motivates all white liberals I think. They don&rsquo;t usually pay the price for their diversity. They get some feeling of self accomplishment while others pay the price.</p>
<p>They will give it all away but in the end even if whites become a minority. In fact I think it will have to happen to begin change but whites will come back and more than likely come back stronger.<br>

<p>Remember that SKIP the psychic predicted&hellip;&hellip;.the white members of Obamaster&rsquo;s cabinet would, within the year, begin to resign (step down they will call it) because of &#8220;personal reasons&#8221; and they will be replaced by non-whites. You can&rsquo;t kill a thousand people at once and go un-noticed BUT! you CAN kill 1000 people one at a time and no one notices or cares, it just takes a little longer, same end result though.</p>

		<p>Okay, so he has two graduate degrees from Harvard. So?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really sad, in a way, but in the case of minorities, an Ivy league diploma doesn&rsquo;t prove much, because not only can minorities get accepted into such schools a lot more easily than it is to get accepted for Whites, these days&hellip; But Ivy league universities, have becomes the ones who do the most affirmative action in America!</p>
<p>I mean, if a guy like Dr Leonard Jefferies can actually get a Ph.D. form New York University, and become a tenured professor at that same university, doesn&rsquo;t that prove that there&rsquo;s something very wrong with affirmative action in the U.S. school system?</p>
