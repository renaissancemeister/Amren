	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That black women are not as domesticated and docile as white women and that we black women do not know how to treat our men. We have gargantuan desires, expectations and wishes from our men and when our anticipations are not met, we make our spouses lives miserable.</p>
<p>The denigration of the black man&rsquo;s image and relevance dates back to the socialization of the black woman. I can remember as a child that my mother inculcated my sisters and i to avoid relationships with black men because they would definitely cause me irreparable, emotional damage. She asserted that they would impregnate me and desert me. Use me, abuse me, ill treat me and abandon me.</p>
<p>My mother contended that black men were irresponsible fathers, substandard caregivers, cheap breadwinners (if any at all), lousy husbands and mates. She contended that they were the worst communicators, and lacked the capacity to compromise, reason without violence and to be civil. She told my three sisters and I to marry a white man. He will be a good husband to you and an excellent father to your children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To be frank with you, my mother has been proven right thus far. I have been with two black men and they have made my life a living hell. {snip} They were not pitched black. They were more like coloureds. They were the &#8216;coco butter&rsquo; complexion black men, the ones that look more like Chris Brown (befitting analogy). They were not from the ghetto and they have been exposed to education and the finer things in life which I assumed would have engendered some changes in their thought processes and general behaviors but obviously not.</p>
<p>It is difficult for any woman to have any respect for black men when most (I said most not all my detractors) are not standing up to their responsibilities. I have no respect norr regard for any man who does not take care of his family or exhibits conduct that are worthy of emulations by my children. {snip}</p>
<p>Conclusively, the reason why we have no respect for our men is because they have no respect for themselves. They have no knowledge nor understanding of what their roles are within a family. They do not understand that when they conceive a child that it does not end there, that they should be part of its upbringing and maintenance. Most black men are in part sperm donors and bed room racklers. They think bragging about the scores of children that they have dispersed all over the place denotes good fatherhood and that women are therapy valves for them to vent their inadequacies and insecurities.</p>
<p>Our men have let us down. To be honest the only reason why we even cohort with them is because of this primal mammalian need to have sex and our instinctual desire for companionship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} But black men please do not give those reasons for not dating black women. Because we all now that a good black man is difficult to find!<br>

		<p>I have heard that femicide is the leading cause of death for black women of a certain young age range, and that the cause is almost always violent black men.</p>
<p>However, there is a flip side to this coin.  Let&rsquo;s consider why a lot of black men don&rsquo;t like black women.  I am of the opinion that many black women want not much more than money from black men, and many black men want not much more than sex from black women.  In other words, a lot of black relationships are only slightly more than out and outright prostitution.  It gets thorny when the man is uncomfortable with the woman&rsquo;s monetary demands, or the woman is upset with the man&rsquo;s sexual appetite.</p>

		<p>A black female friend of mine was very pro-African-American, and very active in civil rights and Black causes.  She tried very hard for 5 years to find and marry a good Black man.  She refused to give up, and enlisted the help of everyone she came across, and also searched on Black-internet dating sites, and joined and attended every Black social group and organization she could find.  After dating dozens of Blacks, she finally gave up and married a White.  Although she was totally devoted to her race, in the end, she simply would not lower herself to having to live with a sub-standard husband and father for her children.  She had a child with her White husband, and they are still living together with an upper-Middle Class income and lifestyle.  However, she knew what everyone else is afraid to admit.  For any intelligent Black woman, it is almost impossible to find a suitable Black husband. </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s tweak this screed</p>
<p>That black women are not as domesticated and docile as white women and that we black women do not know how to treat our White women co-workers, customers, clients and managers. We have gargantuan desires, expectations and wishes from our White women co-workers, customers, clients and managers. When our totally ridiculous anticipations are not met, we make our White co-workers, customers, clients and managers lives miserable.</p>
<p>We are proud to note that we have the highest rate of murdering and abusing our own children of any race.</p>
<p>We are the affirmative action queens.  Women and minorities encouraged to apply means only black women will be hired.  We rule America!!<br>

		<p>Having spent decades working with affirmative action black women, I have nothing but sympathy for the black men and children who must live with them.</p>
<p>I have to live with black women about 43 hours a week.  Why should I, a White woman be the only one to suffer from the horrors of being around black women.</p>
<p>Black women raise their sons to be black men.  They get what they deserve.</p>

<p>All men are bad communicators and lack the capacity to compromise and reason.  The difference is that a good wife can teach a good man to do these things.  They are relationship skills that are absolutely indispensible to a lasting, fulfilling marriage.  A man has to be humble enough to be willing to learn from his wife those things that do not come naturally to him.  Sadly, I&rsquo;m sure there are few black men who can be taught these skills, especially in post-Christian America.</p>

		<p>If Abraham Lincoln had done what he had believed in and returned the Black slaves to their original dwelling so much blood and death could have been saved.  The US actually &#8216;owed&rsquo; them that, although I have a slightly difficult time with the word &#8216;owed&rsquo;.  Black men (and women) have perpetrated far more pain and suffering on White people than all the years of slavery put on them in the distant past.  Case in point:  Over 35,000 White women are raped every year by BLACK MEN.  In the last 200 years there have been only about 6,000 lynchings and most of those were in the very distant past.  Thirty-five thousand plus rapes   &mdash;   TODAY IN 2009.    &mdash;   MEDIA SILENT.</p>

<p>Right, as if large numbers of White men were standing in line to marry a black woman.  Crystal you know it&rsquo;s a two way street when it comes to relationships, right?  I&rsquo;ve seen black couples out in public where the women were just totally humiliating their men by being loud, bossy and uppity.  Is it any wonder black women can&rsquo;t find a husband?  Who would put up with that?  Girl, &#8220;You ain&rsquo;t all that&#8221;.  Don&rsquo;t take this as meaning I&rsquo;m siding with black men either.  I agree with everyone this article says but black women aren&rsquo;t without their faults either.  </p>

		<p>For the heck of it, I&rsquo;m going to go after the outlandish statement by &#8220;sofita&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;All men are bad communicators and lack the capacity to compromise and reason.  A man has to be humble enough to be willing to learn from his wife those things that do not come naturally to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a White man who&rsquo;s been married to a White woman for 37 years.  The number one daily enigma for me is to sort out speech patterns she utters and to discover what the actual meanings are.</p>
<p>My spouse is very bright and all the other things that have made me want to stay with her all these years but she is NOT the great communicator.  Both sexes need to humble themselves on occasion but the problem is not just the bane of one of males.</p>
<p>Many aspects of living in wedlock for four decades and not killing each other (on those bad days we all have) are not &#8220;naturally&#8221; occurring traits.  They must be taught and learned through patience and experience.</p>
<p>As for what horrible situations must exist between African partners, I don&rsquo;t even want to think about it. </p>

To poster # 2 Are you proud of your black female friend who married a WHITE man&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black woman actually made a decision that was in HER best interest, not ours.  She was smart enough to see that her quest would be futile.  Now granted her (and HIS) decision was not the best out come for us as a people but I can understand the motivation much better than the white woman who shacks up with a black man.  She, regardless of her socioeconomic back ground, will end up with the short end of that stick.</p>
<p>Today while dinning out i saw a white woman with an oriental husband and two amerasian children.  Reminds of Dondi without the back drop of war.</p>

		<p>In the era of segregation, one of the positives was that even the well to do blacks generally lived in or near the black area(s) of town. Even during the depression, Atlanta had a middle class black area that was separate from most, but this was an anomaly. However, with the few middle and upper class blacks in the picture, there was a lot more discipline within that community. The blacks that could get along with the white community probably did not want to risk the wrath of an all white police force coming in for a beatdown, so they made every effort to keep a lid on things; and if needed, round up some men to knock a few heads. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I blame the blacks who are achievers (and yes, there are some out there) for not wanting to live in the ghetto. I don&rsquo;t particularly care to live next to whites who are straight out of central casting for daytime talk shows. </p>
<p>In this day and age, what is the need of a husband? Especially if he can&rsquo;t bring in as much as the welfare check or the modest but steady paycheck from Uncle Sam. For a business, hiring a black female allows you to check off two quota boxes even if she is an utter incompetent. For a government agency, it is almost mandatory unless it is an area like IT where non Asian minorities are as rare as hen&rsquo;s teeth. Whenever I have to renew my license, I head out to a branch that is in the boondocks and is in a county that is virtually all white. I&rsquo;ve been at the counter when Sheniqua picks up her cell phone to argue with her &#8220;baby daddy&#8221; over diaper money. It is not a pretty sight. </p>
<p>What a wonderful combination, a group of people who are virtually guaranteed employment due to color and sex that also have incredible chips on their shoulders. Gee, I can&rsquo;t imagine why the male of this species might look in another direction. However, from the female angle, the male of this species generally engages in dangerous and reckless behavior long past their teenage years. He is constantly in and out of the system and often times, cannot hold a useful job. I&rsquo;ll agree, for the most part, they deserve each other. </p>

		<p>Culture is a particular human group&rsquo;s rituals, beliefs, mating practices, and social practices that allow it survive.  The elements of culture allow the group to survive in its special environment.  The genes that allow a person to adapt in turn reinforce the culture. The culture grows stronger as it feeds upon itself.<br>
 <br>
Africa is very different from Europe.  The culture that the African blacks developed and in which they cultivated is radically different from the culture of European whites.  The African hunting generic makeup that produced successful males also produced a different mating and reproductive culture.  It is different from the colder climate culture where there is a need for planning and long term maintenance.</p>
<p>When a black hunter has food he can pick the best child bearing female.  She will take him because he can provide.  It is day to day because every day the success of the hunt is equally likely.  There is no need to store food for the cold season.   When the female becomes pregnant and thus unattractive he leaves her for another female.  These mating traits are ingrained after thousands of generation.</p>
<p>Placing a large number of Africans in a European environment will not change their genetic proclivities.  In America the strong social restraints put on the African natives until the Civil Rights Revolution kept them somewhat subdued, but when allowed to behave naturally they have reverted to their natural behavior.</p>
<p>Crystal Evans paints a flattering picture of the black woman.  But to survive in Africa her ancestors would develop little attachment or affection for the male food provider but would develop a great deal of resentment.  To survive an African woman would be emotionally able to kick out yesterday&rsquo;s food provider gone bad and welcome a today&rsquo;s good one.  </p>
<p>Also she must have help from her mother and father.  The mother and father know for sure that the child has their genes.  This is important in black Africa and in black America.  Back men and women have not developed a religious or moral gene to keep them from engaging in endless booty calls.  Killing a wayward mate in Africa is no big deal for the warrior.<br>

		<p>      Great communicators, women? My sister hates to explain herself. When asked where the bills are, she will blurt out the first thing she can think of, unless she already has an agenda in place. When one story doesn&rsquo;t work, she&rsquo;ll just make up another one-without a trace of shame or irony. There is no consensual reality-what she wants, feels, or thinks at that moment is reality-until it changes. Some of the fuzziness is real but some is strategic enabling her to shift her ground instantaneously. I share a duplex with her and we have bills in common. It is hell.</p>

		<p>I was interested to read the erroneous phrase &#8216;pitched black&rsquo; in the article.<br>
The term is, of course, &#8216;pitch black&rsquo;, where &#8216;pitch&rsquo; refers to an old term for a perfectly black bituminous substance previously used for water-proofing the gaps in wooden boats.<br>
 What &#8216;pitched&rsquo; refers to do I do not know, perhaps baseball metaphors have got mixed-up here.</p>

		<p>Sosthenes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are occasional couples where the man is the better communicator, but that isn&rsquo;t the usual way of things.  The point is you know that 37 year relationships don&rsquo;t just happen.  You have to learn communication and dispute-resolution skills to make them happen.  </p>
<p>My husband is an absolute first-class gentleman, but he constantly has to relearn basic things like assertiveness and I-messages.  I have resigned myself to having to deal with bad communication habits that have been built up over the years before we met for the rest of my life.  Its like a chronic disease that can&rsquo;t be cured only managed.  And from what I gather I&rsquo;m not alone.  Most married women have the same issues.  I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;re the exception that proves the rule.  </p>
<p>Congratulations on your many years of happy marriage.</p>

		<p>While I get the import of the young woman&rsquo;s message, and sympathize with her plight, I cannot help but notice the atrocious grammar, at which an eighth-grade level White child would do better. </p>
<p>And perhaps that is part of the problem.</p>
<p>Blacks simply do not excel in what might be called &#8220;civilizational skills.&#8221; These skills can be correct grammar, proper history, or proper conduct.</p>
<p>Most of these skills used to be taught to the younger generation.<br>
The fact that the woman was more talkative than the male, and had to use devices to draw him out, was commonly known. The fact that the man wanted to be the protector and breadwinner, in spirit if not in fact, was also commonly known.</p>
<p>These things were taught, maybe not in school, but they were taught, along with correct grammar, math skills, and knowledge of history  &mdash;  history that extolled White civilization.</p>
<p>If these things have been lost among Whites, how much more so among Blacks?</p>
<p>Any negativity among Whites is magnified among Blacks.</p>
<p>Any positivity among Whites is dampened by Blacks.</p>
<p>An example:  Blacks, in general, cannot even hold a decent conversation. They will not listen to the other person, nor will they stop talking long enough for the other person to even speak. To top it off, most of the time they do not even know what they are talking about.</p>

		<p>Re &#8220;Sofita&#8221; and men being poor communicators:  I am a white woman happily married to a white man for almost twenty years.  While I have women friends and most definitely a feminine side of my nature, I find most women poor communicators because everything is based on emotion, not reason, and because most women are AIRHEADS.  Communication, like a good marriage, takes two.</p>
<p>Re &#8220;Ryan Chaserian&#8221; and his assertion that the article is &#8220;beautifully written.&#8221;  First few sentences alone, she uses &#8220;spouses&#8221; in a possessive sense without the apostrophe at the end to denote the possessive plural; she uses the term &#8220;inculcated&#8221; incorrectly; she mixes her objective/subjective pronoun (mother told sisters and &#8220;I&#8221; when it should have been &#8220;me&#8221;; shall I go on?  And for those typical individuals who insist that proper grammar and/or syntax doesn&rsquo;t matter, check your own posts; there are numerous obvious errors in all of them which indicate, to me, a lack of education or precise communication, which has always been a province of more advanced civilizations and the white race in general.</p>

		<p>I disagree with question diversity on this one, I am of the opinion that mostly it is black men demanding money from the women in their lives, not the other way around. Black women in return only ask in return that their men stay out of jail and keep their cheating within reasonable limits, which are often unreasonable demands. </p>
<p>Seems to me like Black women are able to, and are in fact usually willing to hold down some kind of job, even if they perform their duties in a sulky, slothful, resentful manner. Black men on the other hand seem unwilling to show up for any kind or real job no matter how easy, and seem to prefer live with their grandmothers until they are 30 or so, living off the generosity of their overworked grandmothers, the women they are ostensibly dating or hooking up with or whatever, and of course the prison system aka &#8220;College&#8221; in the black community.</p>

		<p>To give respect, you first must learn respect - respect for you parent(s), yourself, others, for property, etc.  Then you must act in a manner worthy of respect yourself. Young black women (and whites) need to take more responsibility about their choices of males, which one cannot do if you&rsquo;re not taught about respect at home.

		<p> Sounds like the black woman&rsquo;s mother knew what she was talking about when it came to black men. She&rsquo;d probably experienced it herself. Routine news stories about deadbeat black men with 22 or 23 children to their &#8220;credit&#8221;, plus ample anecdotal evidence about the worthlessness of most black men in the job market, black men&rsquo;s lack of impulse control, propensity for extreme violence, etc., all back her up.</p>
<p> I wonder, however, where black women got the idea that White women were either &#8220;domesticated&#8221; or &#8220;docile.&#8221; Maybe only in comparison to themselves.</p>

<p>In reply to your statement about how your black lady friend made the decision to marry a White man as being in HER best interest, I really don&rsquo;t care about HER best interests. It is NOT in OUR best interest that there are White male or females that go outside of their own race to marry or date, period.

Thank you for pointing that out (as did several others&hellip; e.g. &#8220;pitched black&#8221;).  I would not ordinarily pick on someone&rsquo;s grammar, but if she&rsquo;s going to write articles for publication then she should display at least minimal competence in the language.  Especially if she writes for a living.  Is she a professional journalist?  (And where were her editors? Proof readers?  More Affirmative Action promotees?)</p>
<p><br>
Take this jabber:  <i>&#8220;I have no respect norr regard for any man who does not take care of his family or exhibits conduct that are worthy of emulations by my children.&#8221;<i> (How many mistakes in one sentence?)  And this repeatedly: &#8220;my mother has told my sister and I&#8221;.  </i></i></p>
<p><br>
But what&rsquo;s worse, she&rsquo;s hardly alone.   Across the board, we see the deterioration of language.  I am tired of seeing (in supermarkets) &#8220;mash potatos&#8221; [sic] for mashed potatoes,  &#8220;can goods&#8221; for canned goods, &#8220;boil ham&#8221;, &#8220;bake beans&#8221;, and &#8220;fry chicken&#8221;  for baked, boiled and fried.   Many others too.  It&rsquo;s consistent. The English language is being reduced to a pidgin of uttermost simplicity; a vocabluary of a few hundred simple words that anyone can understand, stripped of any refinement or subtlety.  And recently on a printed sign in a large building, &#8220;This door must be kept lock at all times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Affirmative action at work again?   Pathetic.</p>

		<p>So what? What other options do black women have? Most black women fortunately do not like dating White men and I hope it remains that way. Many White men today are so brainwashed that they choose to have relationships with black women over much better looking, intelligent and better behaved White women. I really fear frustrated black women accepting the advances of these brain washed White men. That would be a disaster for the White race. This is a problem within the black community and has nothing to do with us.</p>

		<p>The fact is, black women have had a role in creating the worthless black men.  With the giveaway programs of the 1960&rsquo;s, black women saw that being on the welfare roles brought in more money than going out and working a job.  Black men saw that too, and many decided the women could get along just fine without them - why should they work to support a family when the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t was doing a better job of it than they could???  This situation encouraged and eventually was key in the destruction of the black family situation.  The men felt useless - they couldn&rsquo;t compete with guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t money, and the women, seeing this, said, &#8220;Who needs them?&#8221; and went on their own.  I think this is a clear example of why welfare is ALWAYS destructive to the recipients.  Receiving free health care is going to cause more problems than it solves, I believe.  It all goes back to the individual taking responsibility for who, where, what s/he is at every moment of every day.  If you aren&rsquo;t willing to do that, you end up in the victim/entitlement consciousness that typifies the current residents of the black ghetto.</p>

<p>&#8220;All men are bad communicators and lack the capacity to compromise and reason. The difference is that a good wife can teach a good man to do these things. They are relationship skills that are absolutely indispensible to a lasting, fulfilling marriage. A man has to be humble enough to be willing to learn from his wife those things that do not come naturally to him. Sadly, I&rsquo;m sure there are few black men who can be taught these skills, especially in post-Christian America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha,&hellip; Aristotle couldn&rsquo;t reason, Plato couldn&rsquo;t reason, Socrates, couldn&rsquo;t reason, etc., and neither George Washington nor Thomas Jefferson could reason - they were all prompted by their wives like the rest of us.  Bachelor intellectuals never existed!  Science, created and promoted by some dolts wives!  Must I go on?  </p>
<p>I have known plenty of women who cannot communicate well.  The fact is that most people are poor communicators.  Women usually just talk more, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they communicate well.  And you are a perfect example of that.  Any writer or communication expert knows that it is a mistake and error to use the words, &#8220;always, never, etc., as a descriptor of character or habit.  Further, your assumption that ALL women are teachers to ALL men is pure conceit and evidence of petty training as a &#8220;militant&#8221; feminist.</p>
<p>Even though I reject Christianity as a problem for whites or any society that means to progress, in Christianity the woman is subserviant to the man; the man teaches the wife what she must do, etc.  Basic skills are more often passed from mother to daughter, but it is a patriarchal set of teachings none-the-less.</p>
<p>The breakdown in families and social fabric is more due to the post-industrial age than religion or lack of it.  </p>

		<p>it&rsquo;s easy to see that black men really don&rsquo;t care for black women, they have no problem airing a long list of complaints against black women, and conversely black women really don&rsquo;t care for black men, viewing them with as much contempt as white folks normally do.<br>
So why are whites, and particularly white women expected to lower their standards and inter-marry with blacks in the name of racial harmony? why do whites think everything will be different? From daytime TV shows, it&rsquo;s clear that black mens&rsquo; behavior doesn&rsquo;t change much after dating/marrying a white woman, court programs and maury povich shows are full of white women who&rsquo;s lives are every bit as miserable as any black womans,  black men are being sued and DNA tested just as much as if they had married a black woman, the only difference is that white women have so much more to lose when they gamble on a black man </p>

		<p>Dear Whiteplight,</p>
<p>For heaven&rsquo;s sake there is no reason to be so strident.  Obviously, non-Christians can use the faculty of reason.  And I obviously don&rsquo;t mean to say that men are incapable of using their faculty of reason in general without help from women.  I&rsquo;m sure there have been plenty of great intellectuals that were bachelors.  That isn&rsquo;t what I was talking about at all.  </p>
<p>Did you read the original article?  What the original article was talking about was how black men relate to their wives.  Among the things they can&rsquo;t do are &#8220;compromise and reason without violence.&#8221;  She was not talking about using reason in general, but about using reason in the course of resolving a dispute with your spouse.  She was saying that when faced with conflict with their wives, black men will not reason it out to see whose position actually is the most rational, but rather will simply rule by dictatorship, enforced if necessary by violence.</p>
<p>I think this is a very common pattern in marriages the world over.  I also believe that it is part of why feminism emerged.  Because men in the past have been imperfect family leaders, feminists, being radicals, decided that they should not be family leaders at all.  Power corrupts after all, right?</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t have to go that way.  Our society could have looked to our Christian heritage for an answer to domestic tyranny.  Conservative Christian churches teach that the husband is the head of the family and &#8220;servant leadership&#8221; is the ideal that is expected of him.  As Christ said to his disciples, &#8220;Which of you would be first, let him be last.&#8221;  That is, be humble, and share decision-making power with your wife, pulling rank only when you have carefully considered what she has to say and you cannot compromise in good conscience.</p>
<p>I do not believe that happy marriages are possible without the ideal of self-sacrificial humility found in the New Testament and the notion of total union (&#8220;one flesh&#8221;) found in the Old Testament.  Not that there can&rsquo;t be happy marriages among non-believers, only that they are, in fact, practicing these ideals, whether they realize it or not.  I can tell you, I would certainly not have wanted to be married to an ancient pagan man.  They held their women in low regard, and I would have been treated as little more than a household slave, unless I was very, very lucky.   </p>

Marriage is an equal partnership where both spouses should respect each other and work together. I don&rsquo;t think men are worse communicators but I do think men and women often communicate differently and that can at times cause misunderstandings or miscommunication.</p>

		<p>Blacks, whether they are male or female ALL have horrible attitudes. They all think they are better than everyone, and can do whatever they want, and if anyone says anything they are totally wrong. They destroy every neighborhood they move to by running the house/apt. into the ground, allowing their spawn to run the streets day, and night, and since they never taught them any manners, they litter, ruin people&rsquo;s property, throw rocks&hellip; they blast music from their cars, and house, they stop their cars in the middle of the road, blocking traffic, and if you beep, they refuse to move. I lived in a nice neighborhood that was all white. It was clean, quiet, and virtually crime free. Some of the older people past away, or sold their houses, and the people who bought them turned them into apts. or rented the house to blacks, or hispanics. Soon the places had the screen doors ripped off, broken windows, garbage all over, loud music, people fighting, crime&hellip; I sold my house fro quite a loss, and moved into another nice neighborhood, now there are 2 houses that have blacks in them, and of course, there is always loud music, cars revving, kids causing problems, littering&hellip; People can call this racist all they want, I call it the FACTS. If I could move somewhere that was segregated, I would work 2 jobs to pay for it! I really worry for my son, and his future. He is 11, and has already been jumped by 2 older black kids. </p>

		<p>I believe the races should stay with their own like evolution created (and God intended). As a white person I always believed black woman and black men make perfect couples. There are numerous black men who can take care of their wowman. </p>
<p>The main problem with black relationships is the problem of gangs, drop outs, hiv, drugs, employment, and careless self-esteem culture within the black community.</p>
<p>Blacks Men &amp; Woman have too much self-worth and tend to be careless about life. </p>
<p>Blacks are extremely careless at a young age. As a student virtually most of the blacks I went schools with didn&rsquo;t care about their grades. They have a arrogant world view in which because their black it&rsquo;s ok for them not to care. Black history month and MLK day make it worse because now they feel that they are owed something and have less a reason to care (now they just blame all their failures on whites).</p>
<p>I can tell you now, but if the black community is to better itself it starts with school. Blacks need to be more focused in school. One of the crimes of desegreation is that it has affected the white students placed in schools with blacks. Now, you&rsquo;ll see white kids just as careless, big shirt wearing, gangsta image as the black students. It is disgusting what desgregation has done to white kids. It has replaced the manners once found in white schools and replaced that culture with black gangsta culture.</p>
<p>If black woman want to find good black men than Black mom and dads need to start at an early age and tell their kids to study hard in school. </p>

<p>I agree with much of your post.  But how do you excel in school if that&rsquo;s just not your &#8220;thing&#8221;?  People are talented in various ways, and schoolwork isn&rsquo;t always one of them. Not everyone was cut out to be a scholar.</p>
<p>Perhaps we ought to put more attention back on practical training for the crafts and trades, and less on getting an academic degree. How many sociologists and PhD&rsquo;s in Black Studies do we need anyway?</p>

		<p>To thought</p>
<p>Before integration, students in black schools were quite disciplined and often more disciplined than the students in white schools.  Thomas Sowell pointed this out.  In my opinion, a liberal way of thinking is far more harmful to blacks than to whites and when exposed to the more liberal view of education that resulted from integration, black students lost an enormous amount of discipline.</p>
<p>Blacks are in greater need of highly disciplined societies to function and before integration, black society was centered around the church and governed by the church&rsquo;s moral rules.  That is when there were successful black townships like Tulsa and Rosewood.  The problem is that such independent separate towns were subject to attack by whites.  Likewise, when &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; was legal, whites blatantly made it unequal, thus promoting rebellion against it.  It almost seems that whites have been the greatest force to undermine separation as if white society couldn&rsquo;t resist its desire to have an ethnic underclass to serve as its subordinate.  This is probably why whites remain so open to immigration, both legal and illegal.  </p>

Good  question.   I believe it has been schhoteaehr/whiteplicght who has been emphasising the importance of training more people in the useful trades.  I fully agree that we need more competent carpenters than halfbaked sociologists.</p>
<p>I do agree that &#8220;a mind is a terrible thing to waste&#8221;, but being a good carpenter is not a waste,  nor is it anything terrible!  So think that is a form of snobbery. Intellectuals and people who sit behind desks are not the only people who have worth. All honest labour has dignity and worth.   </p>
<p>However it is a terrible waste to send someone to school for 25 years, for an advanced degree, and then have him emerge barely able to write his own name correctly. And with affirmative action, that is exactly what we are getting now.</p>

Interesting comments. I don&rsquo;t know that I agree with them all, but worthy of some thought.  </p>
<p>However, I would not refer to &#8220;white society&#8221; as reguiring an underclass. It&rsquo;s not a matter of whiteness. Capitalist society (or, if you prefer, &#8220;class society&#8221;) requires an exploitable underclass. Anyone (such as illegals) will serve the purpose just as well.  Whiteness really has nothing to do with it. </p>
<p>But yes, once they lost the black underclass, they had to import a new one.  Or make a new one   &mdash;   such as forcing formerly middleclass whites down into a new underclass, replacing the blacks who were once there.</p>

		<p>I had the bad judgement to take a job in the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare many years ago.  My unit was run by a Nigerian Moslem and had two black women as subordinate in the unit.  The fighting that went on between the women and the Nigerian was unbelievable. On one famous occasion, the sound of the fighting was clearly audible outside the heavy wooden door of the Nigerian&rsquo;s office.  While the Nigerian was simply incompetent, the two black women avoided work at all.  One was enormously fat and claimed to have worked for the DEA at one point in her career.  She ended up quiting.  The other one was a tall, dress size 0 who, while she knew the software, still avoided work if at all possible.  The interesting thing about this woman was the frequency with which she fell out of her clothes.  She gave a presentation in front of the unit in a see-through dress.  She made Friday particularly special by wearing tight hip-hugging jeans that highlighted whatever thong she was wearing when you walked past her cubicle.  It was a hellish place to work, but could certainly be entertaining.</p>
