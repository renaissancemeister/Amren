	<p>Race, as the late Samuel Francis writes in the introduction to this collection of race-realist essays, is the Great Taboo of our age, as sex was for the Victorians. Just as the Victorians punished people who &#8220;talked about sex, made jokes about sex, or wrote too openly and frankly about sex,&#8221; so do the racial Victorians of the 21st century, denying as they do the reality of race, punish people who assert that race lies at the heart of many of our most intractable social problems.</p>

<p>Dr. Francis should know. He suffered firsthand the consequences of violating the Great Taboo. At the first American Renaissance conference, held in Atlanta in 1994, he said: </p>
<p>&#8220;[W]e as whites must .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor is there any reason to believe that the civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people. If the people or race that created and sustained the civilization of the West should die, then the civilization also will die.&#8221; </p>
<p>For this and other observations he was fired from his job at the Washington Times, the &#8220;conservative&#8221; Washington newspaper. A lesser man might have groveled to keep his job, and perhaps submitted to sensitivity training. Not Sam Francis. He spent the remaining decade of his life writing and speaking on a variety of topics, including the racial crisis whites face. He spoke at every AR conference until his death in February 2005, and his speeches were always among the highlights of the program. He was, in the words of American Renaissance editor Jared Taylor, &#8220;the premier philosopher of white racial consciousness of our time.&#8221; </p>
<p><em>Race and the American Prospect</em> was Dr. Francis&rsquo;s last book. He conceived of it, chose the contributors, edited their essays, and wrote two chapters. The book as a whole is an exhortation to whites in North America, Europe and Australia to reclaim their racial birthright before they and their descendants are displaced by non-whites in their ancestral homelands. It is not a screed, but a sober, scholarly, well-reasoned examination of the crisis that we as whites face in an era of mass immigration, multi-racialism and multiculturalism. </p>
<p>What is racial consciousness and why is it important to whites? Simply put, racial consciousness is the conviction that a biologically unique group has a right not only to survive, but to thrive, that it is entitled to protect its interests as a group in the geographical territory from which it sprang or in which it developed. Racial consciousness asserts the right of a race to fashion a society and institutions that serve and advance its interests, and from which its people and their descendants are the main beneficiaries. </p>
<p>Racial consciousness is both natural and moral. It is particularly important to whites because it is to them, and to them alone, that it is now prohibited. As even a cursory glance through <em>Race and the American Prospect</em> will show, this was certainly not always the case. But as Dr. Francis explains in the introduction, over the last century the West has suffered a &#8220;racial revolution&#8221; that has &#8220;eviscerated&#8221; white racial consciousness and identity &#8220;through the pseudoscientific denial of race, the political and cultural demonization of whites, and the political and legal destruction of white cultural power.&#8221; The same revolution has encouraged non-white, and indeed anti-white racial consciousness among minority groups. Thanks to mass immigration, within this century non-whites are likely to displace whites as the majority in many of their historic homelands. </p>
<p>Dr. Francis lays out three reasons why whites must recover an explicitly racial consciousness. First, science has rejected the &#8220;race is a social construct&#8221; fallacy. Races are biologically distinct, and one cannot replace another. If whites were to be displaced, no other race could replicate their contribution to human society. Second, independent of the scientific reality of race, whites are entitled to survive and thrive for their own sake, just as all members of a family want that family to survive and thrive. Finally, whites must recover racial consciousness for reasons of self-protection. Every non-white group in Western nations explicitly promotes its own interests. By abandoning racial consciousness, whites have unilaterally disarmed in the face of non-whites who promote their racial interests, often at the expense of whites. </p>
<p>The essays in <em>Race and the American Prospect</em> expound on these three reasons why white racial consciousness needs to reassert itself, and what is likely to occur if whites do not wake up to the crisis they face. The essays examine various aspects of the crisis  &mdash;  from the scientific to the historical, from the religious to the philosophical  &mdash;  and some seek to explain how white racial consciousness, which was so deeply ingrained not just in America but also in Britain and Europe, was lost. </p>
<p>In &#8220;The Reality of Race,&#8221; Kevin Lamb, editor of The Occidental Quarterly, offers a detailed analysis of current scientific thinking on race. Science confirms what racial liberals deny: that race is real, and that it is racial differences that primarily account for the success or failure of different groups. No one who understands genetics any longer subscribes to the environmentalist &#8220;blank slate&#8221; model developed by Frankfurt School sociologists. Those who explain black and Hispanic underachievement in terms of &#8220;racism&#8221; and discrimination have an agenda that is political, not scientific. </p>
<p>In &#8220;Racial Differences in Intelligence, Personality and Behavior,&#8221; Prof. Richard Lynn shows that observations about racial differences throughout history, before the revolution in genetic science, have proven more accurate than those of modern-day sociologists. His conclusions are well known: East Asians have higher IQs than whites, who have higher IQs than blacks. Blacks are more likely than whites, who are more likely than East Asians, to engage in destructive behavior and suffer from what Prof. Lynn calls &#8220;psychopathic personality.&#8221; There is no moral dimension here. Racial differences are the result of evolutionary development in different environments. They do explain, however, why not all population groups fit well into white societies. </p>
<p>The difficulties blacks face in white American society are examined in detail in Joseph Fallon&rsquo;s &#8220;The Cost of Racial Pluralism in Black and White.&#8221; Using data and charts, Mr. Fallon shows that from rates of criminality and welfare use to disease and unemployment, blacks are at the bottom on most indices of social health. The trillions of dollars spent to lift blacks out of poverty since the 1960s  &mdash;  money largely taken from white taxpayers  &mdash;  has not had the transformative effect the architects of the Great Society hoped for. Today, the Great Society&rsquo;s spiritual heirs blame persistent white &#8220;racism,&#8221; and demand even more money and penance from whites. </p>
<p>Having failed to solve the black-white race problem, American elites made things worse in 1965 by opening the United States to mass non-white immigration from Latin America, Asia, and Africa. In &#8220;Immigration and Race,&#8221; Dr. Wayne Lutton, editor of The Social Contract, offers a detailed examination of US immigration from colonial days to the present. For most of its history, the US had an explicitly racial immigration policy. The first naturalization law restricted citizenship to &#8220;free white persons,&#8221; and until the late nineteenth century, nearly all immigrants were from Northwestern Europe: Britain, Ireland and Germany, along with some Dutch and Scandinavians. Chinese and Japanese were excluded on racial grounds. When the source of immigration shifted to Eastern and Southern Europe, old-stock Americans responded with the 1924 Immigration Act, which established national-origin quotas based on the populations of each ethnic group present in the country at the time of the 1890 census (this was later changed to the 1920 census). </p>
<p>Supporters of immigration restriction were unapologetic about their desire to retain the Northwestern European character of the nation. As Congressman William Vaile of Colorado, a prominent supporter of the 1924 act, explained, &#8220;the northern European, and particularly Anglo-Saxons made this country.&#8221; Others helped, but &#8220;they came to this country because it was already an Anglo-Saxon commonwealth. They added to it, they often enriched it, but they did not make it, and have not yet greatly changed it. We are determined that they shall not. It is a good country. It suits us. And what we assert is that we are not going to surrender it to somebody else or allow other people, no matter what their merits, to make it something different.&#8221; No public official today would dare make such a statement. </p>
<p>The immigration restriction movement of the early 20th century was the last hurrah of classic white racial consciousness. Following the Second World War, immigration &#8220;reformers&#8221; worked tirelessly to abolish the national-origins quotas, and scored their great triumph with the 1965 Immigration Act. </p>
<p>Sadly, the story of mass immigration has been played out in all English-speaking countries  &mdash;  Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and even Britain. Derek Turner, editor of the British magazine Right Now! demonstrates in &#8220;The Dis-United Kingdom&#8221; how mass non-white immigration is rapidly turning Britain into a multiracial society, with all the attendant problems: crime, social disintegration, and cloying political correctness. In some ways, the racial situation in Britain is even worse than in the United States, and it beggars belief that Britain, the land of the Anglo-Saxon, a racially homogeneous society for centuries, may be majority non-white by the end of the century. </p>
<p>It is extraordinary how rapidly white consciousness disappeared after the middle of the 20th century. Jared Taylor, in &#8220;The Racial Revolution,&#8221; shows just how deeply racial consciousness was imbued in the men who created and developed the United States. Nearly all of the historical figures of the American past, from Thomas Jefferson to Dwight Eisenhower, had a clear view of themselves as white men living in a white civilization. Even so-called progressives or liberals like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were explicit in their view of America as a white country. By modern standards, nearly every prominent American before the mid-1950s was an irredeemable &#8220;racist.&#8221; Today, the race-realist views of Wilson, Abraham Lincoln, or Samuel Gompers are air-brushed out of the history books. If today&rsquo;s Americans knew the truth about the great figures from their past, they might more easily reassert their legitimate interests. </p>
<p>Atlanta attorney Sam G. Dickson, in &#8220;Race and the South,&#8221; takes a well-deserved swipe at Southern neo-Confederates who deny there was a racial element to the War Between the States. The neo-Confederates refuse to admit that Southern secession was driven primarily by the South&rsquo;s desire to keep black slaves. Mr. Dickson cites leading Confederates like President Jefferson Davis, Vice President Alexander Stephens, and General Robert E. Lee to show that it was slavery  &mdash;  and therefore race and not states&rsquo; rights  &mdash;  that drove the Southern cause. </p>
<p>White racial consciousness was not restricted to Southerners, or even Americans. Brent Nelson and J. L. Woodruff in &#8220;Race and the Left&#8221; and &#8220;Race in Philosophy&#8221; demonstrate that many European social and political philosophers, even those on the left, were critical of blacks and other non-whites, and viewed European civilization as the apotheosis of human achievement. Mr. Woodruff makes a particularly trenchant point. Throughout most of modern history, European and European-derived societies have been so far ahead of non-white societies, that whites did not even think of non-whites in the same terms as themselves. Thus Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence, wrote &#8220;All men are created equal,&#8221; but believed blacks were an inferior race. The enemies of white racial consciousness have seized upon statements like this and applied them to non-whites, something Jefferson would have found absurd and even dishonest. </p>
<p>Who is responsible for what Dr. Francis calls the &#8220;evisceration&#8221; of white racial consciousness? In what will be the most controversial chapters of <em>Race and the American Prospect</em>, both Kevin McDonald and Richard Fausette blame Jews. In &#8220;Jews, Blacks and Race,&#8221; Prof. McDonald writes that Jews view themselves as an out group in Western societies, and have developed an evolutionary strategy of undermining traditional white societies to make them safe for Jews. In his view, this means eliminating white racial consciousness. Thus Jews were at the forefront of the social movement to re-label America as a racially and culturally pluralist nation, in which no one group was dominant. This revisionist notion glorifies &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism.&#8221; Politically, Jews were the force behind the immigration reform movement that abolished the national-origins quota system, opening the country to mass immigration. Prof. MacDonald writes that both movements undermined the US as a white nation, and both were seen by Jews as in their interests. </p>
<p>Mr. Fausette, in &#8220;Race and Religion,&#8221; looks at the decline of Western society from a Biblical perspective. Jews have adhered to God&rsquo;s plan by maintaining biological purity in the form of what he calls &#8220;Orthodox breeding&#8221; communities; non-Jews have not. By accepting aliens into their societies they have violated God&rsquo;s view of how a people should live, and therefore will suffer the punishment of having their &#8220;altars pulled down.&#8221; By placing responsibility for our plight on another group, these two chapters are a departure from the general themes of the book, which are directed towards the thinking and behavior of whites rather than that of others. </p>
<p>Dr. Francis takes a different view of who is responsible for what whites face today. Relying on his study of James Burnham&rsquo;s theory of managerial elites, he writes in &#8220;Why the American Ruling Class Betrays Its Race and Civilization&#8221; that since the New Deal, a new globally oriented, technically sophisticated managerial elite has used its mass-organizational skills to promote its interests and power. This new elite sees any vestige of traditional America  &mdash;  or any other traditional society  &mdash;  as an obstacle, and uses all means at its disposal, including finance and propaganda, to destroy it. It happens that the group interests of Jews coincide with the interests of the new elite, which explains why many Jews have risen to prominence in the institutions the elite has developed since the New Deal. </p>
<p><em>Race and the American Prospect</em> concludes with Richard McCulloch&rsquo;s &#8220;Racial Preservation,&#8221; which outlines how whites could recover and pass on racial consciousness. For Mr. McCulloch, white racial consciousness is love for our people, not hate for any other. It means keeping white racial interests firmly in mind. All public policy must be viewed through the prism of whether it is good for whites. We should not be concerned with the interests of other groups, for they will look after themselves. We should always oppose multiracialism, because it is inherently anti-white and will ultimately lead to the disappearance of whites through race-mixing. </p>
<p><em>Race and the American Prospect</em> is generally quite readable  &mdash;  a testimony to Sam Francis&rsquo;s editing skills  &mdash;  but the book cannot be called an easy read. It is long, it is serious, it is scholarly. At the same time, the variety of its contents, the high quality of its contributors, and the wealth of information it contains are all proof that the field of white racial consciousness has reached a level of maturity and confidence well beyond what activists of 20 or 30 years ago would have imagined. </p>
<p><em>Race and the American Prospect</em> is bristling with arguments many Americans would find eye-opening  &mdash;  if they were ever to hear them. Access to the public is the challenge all dissident movements face. Let us hope that this solid work of reference becomes the volume to which Americans turn as the reality they see around them conflicts ever more sharply with the myths they are told to believe. That would be the legacy most befitting the memory of Sam Francis.</p>

		<p>Either Native Born White Americans organize politically around their legitmate racial interests or they can can continue to vote for the evil party-The Republic party-and experience complete race-replacement within the borders of America at the hands of Bobby Jindal&rsquo;s people and Barack Obama&rsquo;s people.</p>

<p>I agree with Dr. Francis&rsquo;s view as to who is at fault.  Although I believe that Jews played a very large role, they were by no means alone.  In fact, I blame Jews less than the non-Jewish elites who sold out their own for MORE power, MORE privilege, and MORE money.  The Bushes, the Kennedys, the Gramms, the Gateses, the Buffetts, the Clintons, the Waltons, the Rockefellers, the Kerrys, etc., etc.<br>

		<p>Life is a game, The original and ultimate game and wisdom along with its advocates are always a minority. The white race is not a group of perfect heros lacking in any imperfection to be exagerated about and worshiped. However its our genetic link to infinitum in the past and the road to where we are and as I see it, it is we that are a huddled mass that ought to preserve our identity in the face of the vast ocean of obscurity that would swallow us if we don&rsquo;t. As Carl Jung would point out, humans are the only specie that creates its own identity and I think its fair to say the more cerebral the individual the more this is the case. This principle would follow with distinct cultures that are more cerebral. We are the culture that opened Pandoras box or stole fire from the gods because Reason is our forte, which is the vanguard of new tommorows as opposed to circular repetitions of pointless time. To say all people are the same on the inside(equal) is true but only to a degree,.. to take this to be true at all levels  is like saying all art is equal,&hellip; it may be equally called art but not equal in quality,&hellip; which brings us to the different human types that certainly have not produced equivilent quality of life scenario&rsquo;s. I have to agree with Sam Francis, the excellence achieved on the European continent was not born in a vacumn any more than good hoof stock or crops are accidental. People should have the right to maintain their genetic inheritance, just as an individual should have the right to his own thoughts.</p>

		<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the role of science in white replacement. We need to look at what the professors in fields like sociology and anthropology were doing in the decades before the big political changes of the &rsquo;50s and later occurred. Science has a prestige and inevitability that is hard to challenge. If the professors are saying race doesn&rsquo;t exist then society will have to obey. If the professors are saying authoritarian values are unnatural then society will remove the values. So was the science correct? No it wasn&rsquo;t. Who were the most influential professors in these social movements to deny race and end authoritarian values? </p>

		<p>This book occupies a prominent space on my main bookshelf right next to &#8216;Paved With Good Intentions&rsquo; and I consider it one of the most valuable books in my collection.  Anyone entering my home will spot it immediately (that&rsquo;s the point).</p>
<p>The contribution of Professor MacDonald alone is well worth the price of this book. I have read and re-read many of the essays  &mdash;  all of them contain valuable insight.</p>
<p>Those who are interested in a deep understanding of the demise of Whites and Western Civilization  &mdash;  and its main causes  &mdash;   is advised to read this collection.</p>

<p>You ask a very important question, the answer to which needs to be aired and publicized nationally and repeatedly.  Much damage has been done to this country in the name of science  &mdash;  or scientific fraud! </p>
<p>First there is Boas in anthropology.  He was an anti-Darwinian fraud that promoted the &#8216;blank slate&rsquo; theory  &mdash;  that man is a product of his social environment and race does not exist. </p>
<p>According to the late Sam Francis:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Fanz Boas, often called the grandfather of modern anthropology and a pioneer pusher of the idea that race is not a very meaningful concept, merely a &#8216;social construct&rsquo; not found in nature &hellip;. As a Columbia professor from 1899 to 1942, he virtually created modern anthropology, and the students he trained&hellip;dominated the discipline until only a few years ago.</p>
<p>But it now turns out that Boas himself was guilty of no small degree of unscientific blunder &mdash; and maybe even fraud.</p>
<p>In political terms, if human beings have few or no &#8216;fixed characters&rsquo; and are shaped by the social environment, then what we know as modern liberalism is in business. So is communism, which also assumes that human beings can be transformed by manipulating the social environment.</p>
<p>By 1926 every major department of anthropology was headed by Boas&rsquo;s students&hellip;by the time of the immigration enthusiasts&rsquo; final victory in 1965, the Boasian perspective had become standard academic wisdom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no accident that Boas was a lifelong sympathizer of Marxism&hellip;&#8221;</p>

&ldquo;Dr. Francis takes a different view of who is responsible for what whites face today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with Dr. Francis&rsquo;s view as to who is at fault. Although I believe that Jews played a very large role, they were by no means alone. In fact, I blame Jews less than the non-Jewish elites who sold out their own for MORE power, MORE privilege, and MORE money. The Bushes, the Kennedys, the Gramms, the Gateses, the Buffetts, the Clintons, the Waltons, the Rockefellers, the Kerrys, etc., etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; How many Kerrys?, the Hairy Kerrys, etc., etc.?</p>
<p>I gather that what you mean to say is that more Christians acted in the acts against white race survival than people of the Jewish faith.  That is not a very useful conclusion as it indictes more Christian Whites than Jews of any color.  But I find your old worn out &#8220;Blame the Jews&#8221; as an ultimately unhelpful postion and tactic since many Jews, especially in the U.S. are White and also conservative.  Will some Whites steeped in the mythology of the vicious Jew raise their IQ enough to finally realize that Jews set the best example for all Whites?  </p>
<p>In spite of the much of the world&rsquo;s best efforts, including apparently, people like you, Jews have continued to exist as a coherent White ethnicity with traditions that go back thousands of years.  Because they respected education, and law, they have rose in every society they have been driven into or out of, and contributed greatly to that societies success.  Even the Roman conquerors had Jewish suppliers for their armies, as the later Monarchs of Europe got their luxuries and financial and medical assistances from Jews.  </p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, the only medical school in Europe was in Montepellar and was staffed overwhelmingly by Jews, the essential contributions of members of the Jews in Europe is well documented in any reputable encyclopedia of European History.  And it was vital.  For example, without the Jews and their ability to traverse between the Arab and Christian worlds in the Middle Ages, Europe would have continued to wallow in poverty and ruin, perhaps even up to today.  It might all be Russia or even part of a great Mongolian/Hungarian state.  The Monarchs of Europe absolutely depended upon Jewish financiers and merchants in order to raise armies and conquer. That is why Carolingian Dynasty actually protected the Jews as a special class as did the Normans in England and so on.  It was the Church that opposed the Jews because it allowed monarchs to be independent of Church edicts and direction. &gt; Not my claim, plainly stated in The Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, (Cantor)  Think about that, fellow would be intellectuals.</p>
<p>It is the ignorance of Whites on the real issues and the continuance of harmful myths that continues to defeat and prevents Whites from moving forward into a new era of empowerment.  It is going to require an entire new interpretation of ourselves and how we see ourselves.  Getting rid of the inherent contradictions of Christianity and one of its worst products, Jewish scapgoating, is one of them. I think that the American style Jew blaming is rooted in the left overs of the Black Plague mythology of cause by Jewish Well Poisoning, a vicious myth with no factual basis and no scientific link either.  The poor, ignorant first inhabitants of North America arrived almost as refugees of Plague ridden Europe.  I know because my own ancestors were among them.  </p>
<p>I sincerely think that fixing ourselves to a newly reinvented indigenous European cosmology is where we will reunite with our true culture, lands, and affirmations in our right to survive on this earth.  </p>

		<p>If only more whites would follow the example set by Francis. As a second year college student, I am going to take a history course that ranges from ancient history to early modern times. Apparently, my professor is a non-white who also teaches a class on the history of Eurocentrism. Therefore, I should not be too surprised is he espouses anti-western beliefs that assert the Greeks stole philosophy from Africans, all Western ideas originated from non-white nations, and non-white empires such as the Persian Empire were benevolent compared to us horrible Europeans. If only there were active white scholars in academia with the backbone to counter and refute such blatantly anti-western revisionist history that portrays western society as the bane of the world. As a young white person who is part of campus life, I would like to know what I could do to combat the anti-western bias and racial double standards that pervade not only my campus, but campuses throughout the nation.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a non-Jewish white and have a question-why is everyone always blaming Jews for all the problems today?  Not all jews are communists or socialists.  In fact, many Jews got persecuted under Communist Russia.  In fact, there are Jews (like Savage and David Horowitz, for example) that speak critically against anti-white racism, non-white victim mentality, and illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Ask your profs this:  If the Greeks supposedly stole ideas from a black library, and every good idea that originated in the West was really stolen from Africa, then why isn&rsquo;t Africa prosperous with these good ideas?  And how is it possible to &#8220;steal&#8221; an idea from a library in Alexandria, Egypt without losing it?  If someone steals your car, you&rsquo;re without a car.  If someone steals your idea, you still have the idea.</p>

		<p>I believe approximately 75% of Jews, (along with 95% of blacks) are liberal supporters.  The Jews are are far more dangerous than the blacks due to their superior intellects.  However, the other 25% as well as 5% of blacks are conservatives and our allies, in my opinion.  Dr. Michael Levin is a terrific asset whose contributions are quite valuable.  At this point, I see separation as our only hope, but I&rsquo;d also hope that our allies will come with us. </p>

		<p>8 anonymous white person: The best way to expose an idiot professor is to ask questions.  It&rsquo;s his role to know things and your role to learn from him, so if he can&rsquo;t give satisfactory answers, his trustworthiness is undermined, whereas your ignorance, real or feigned, is expected and appropriate.  And in your situation, demonstrating to the others in the class that the prof is a fool is the best thing you can do.  After a while, he may stop answering your questions, but the class will recognize that the prof is dodging an issue whenever your hand goes up.  Your upraised arm becomes a silent, polite, &#8220;You lie&#8221;.  </p>
<p>To play this game, you had better have done the assigned readings.  An &#8220;A&#8221; student challenging the teacher is seeking knowledge, but a &#8220;C&#8221; student doing the same will be seen as merely a disruptive punk.  </p>
<p>11 Q.D: The library at Alexandria was a Greek library, as was the entire city.  It was the capital of the Ptolemaic Empire, established in the name of Alexander the Great if not by him, and ruled by his Greek successors.  No Egyptians need apply, and certainly not Blacks.</p>

<p>It was much the same with Iran. I can recall the same &#8220;enlightened&#8221; persons who were prominent (here in America) in picketing and  opposing the Shah. They were fiercely opposed to his government and wanted to bring it down.  Finally they succeeded.  The Shah&rsquo;s government fell and fanatical Islam took over.  After that, much of the Iranian Jewish community fled the country and they are now to be found in Los Angeles. There are very few Jews still living in Iran  today.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity, thank you for your advice. However, I still am at a loss for how to combat the multiculturalism that is plaguing white students on college campuses throughout the nation. There is absolutely no way I would be able to create a student organization that is pro-white. Nobody would sponsor me and I would be hounded by the diversity thought police. There has to be SOMETHING I can do.</p>

		<p>I would like to address the issue of anti-Semitism and anger at Jews. While I too can get frustrated at certain ultraliberal Jews for their denigration of white people, I recognize that we also have many Jewish allies. Whenever I find myself angry at Jews, I often think of Tim Wise, Noel Ignatiev, Susan Sontag, and other anti-white thinkers. However, I also recognize that there are pro-white Jews such as Michael Levin, Michael Hart, David Horowitz, and Michael Savage (despite the fact that some of his other views are a bit loony). Besides, since Jews do exercise such great influence in our society, is it really wise to go after them? As white nationalists, we must pick and choose our battles carefully, and seek out whatever allies we can.</p>

<p>You can tell to your &#8220;prof&#8221; that Persian Empire was white; in fact, was the first white empire (Iranians are generally light caucasians). The same can be said about Phoenicians, Assirians, Sumerians, Akkadians, Hittites, Islamic Empires (Arab and Turkish). <br>
They were not Europeans or Christians, but Race is not a &#8220;social-cultural&#8221; construction, remember? - Mexicans are Christians and Bosnians are Muslims&hellip;</p>

<p>My understanding of Alexandria, like the empire it was in, is that it was Hellenistic, in that it was not purely Greek, nor purely Egyptian (the New Kingdom had mulattoed itself out of existence for some time), but a combination of various virtues from all parts of Alexander&rsquo;s empire.</p>

		<p>21 Q.D: I stand corrected, the empires ruled by Alexander&rsquo;s successors were not &#8220;Greek&#8221;, they were &#8220;Hellenic&#8221;.  That is, they included descendants of Macedonians (North of Greece) and Ionians (Greek speakers from western Turkey) in the dominant race.  Alexander had required his generals to take non-Hellenic wives, so as to absorb the ruling classes of the people&rsquo;s he conquered, but when he died, the officers mostly dumped the foreign wives.  The Hellenes were willing learners and adopted foreign knowledge and the trappings of Asiatic despots, the better to rule over their new subjects, but remained Hellenic in race and culture. </p>
<p> But there were many couplings between the wifeless soldiers and the locals, and consequently a lot of Greek-speaking half Hellenes, and in time 3/4 and 7/8 and 1/4 and 1/8 Hellenes.   After a century or two, the original Hellenic race and culture were diluted but still saw themselves as Greek, and saw the original locals as barbarians, or civilized barbarians at best.   They had respect for the Ancient Egyptians who built the pyramids a couple thousand years earlier, but thought the current natives were degenerate.  (Whites should pay heed to this history.  If White men mix with non-White women, sooner or later non-White men will mix with White women.  An empire is a dangerous thing to have, it brings the foreigner into our nation and make him one of us.  The old &#8220;one drop rule&#8221; made a lot of sense.)  </p>
<p>And the Hellenes definitely did not look to Black Africa for anything but ivory and the like.  The Greeks knew civilization when they saw it, having conquered Persia, Phoenicia, and Egypt, and they saw no civilization among the Blacks.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous white person, look up Youth for Western Civilization. They seem to be active and have a number of campus chapters. If that isn&rsquo;t an option for you, they you&rsquo;ll have to do what we adults are doing which is supporting organizations and introducing people we know to them. There is a white movement happening now and if we help where we can, then eventually a more active university presence will arise.</p>
