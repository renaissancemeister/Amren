<h1>Cartoon Controversy Returns to Campus</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Needham and Esther Zuckerman, Yale Daily News, September 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It seems that &#8220;The Cartoons that Shook the World&#8221; may shake Yale&rsquo;s campus again.</p>
<p>Both Jytte Klausen, the author of the book about the violence surrounding Danish cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, and Kurt Westergaard, the original author of one of those cartoons, will be on campus Thursday. The events, each organized separately, will occur at different times and different locations.</p>
<p>Westergaard, whose visit to campus has been promoted by the International Free Press Society, will speak in conversation with Branford College Master Steven Smith, though the Master&rsquo;s Tea will be held at the Greenberg Conference Center on Prospect Street. University Vice President and Secretary Linda Lorimer said the event was moved from the college because of security concerns and said the Yale Police Department is arranging appropriate protection for the event. Westergaard&rsquo;s cartoon depicted the prophet with a bomb in his turban.</p>
<p>The Yale Muslim Students Association said in a statement that its members are &#8220;deeply hurt and offended&#8221; by the decision to invite Westergaard to speak, but the group will not protest at the event. MSA president Tariq Mahmoud &#8216;11 said the group plans on attending the event and asking &#8220;critical and probing questions&#8221; during the question and answer session after the talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an institution purportedly committed to making our campus an educational environment where all students feel equally comfortable, we feel that by hosting Kurt Westergaard Yale is undermining its commitment to creating a nurturing learning environment by failing to recognize the religious and racial sensitivity of the issue,&#8221; the group said. &#8220;Certainly, it would be unlikely for a white supremacist or a holocaust denier to be a distinguished guest speaker at Yale; hosting individuals who propagate hate is not only a disservice to the minorities that hate is directed towards but to the campus community as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>The MSA is also planning on organizing a panel to discuss the cartoons, Mahmoud added.</p>
<p>On the other hand a group of Muslim students not affiliated with the MSA is planning a protest, said Faez Syed &#8216;10, one of the organizers. He said that while they still have to confirm some of the details, a small group of students will picket the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s our opinion that it&rsquo;s more hate speech rather than free speech,&#8221; Syed said of the decision to invite Westergaard.</p>
<p>Lorimer said, though, that &#8220;an invitation to speak on campus doesn&rsquo;t imply any institutional support for the speaker. It indicates, instead, a commitment to let all views be aired.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said the University does not involve itself in a professor&rsquo;s decision to invite a speaker to campus except in situations where there is a threat to safety. Lorimer cited the 1975 Woodward Report on free expression at Yale in explaining the importance of hearing a wide range of views on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The banning or obstruction of lawful speech can never be justified on such grounds as that the speech or the speaker is deemed irresponsible, offensive, unscholarly or untrue,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Because of the controversy surrounding the cartoons, the University has provided for extra security measures and the YPD has been working with the city, state and federal law enforcement officials to ensure safety.</p>
<p>In an e-mail to Branford students, Smith said that students will only be admitted with a ticket that will be checked against a Yale ID. Students will have to take a bus that will depart from the Branford master&rsquo;s house and leave backpacks, bookbags, purses and cell phones behind. The event is intended for Branford students and affiliates, Smith wrote in the e-mail.</p>
<p>A few hours after Westergaard speaks, Klausen will air her views in a lecture at Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall. Her talk is entitled &#8220;Blasphemy and Inquiry: &#8216;The Cartoons That Shook the World&rsquo;&#8221; and is sponsored by the Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism. Klausen&rsquo;s book initially incited a controversy in August after the Yale University Press and the University decided not to publish any images of the prophet Muhammad in the book about the 2005 violence that erupted over the publication of the Danish cartoons.</p>
<p>Klausen said it was a complete coincidence that she and Westergaard will be on campus at the same time, and said she only learned about it from a report in a newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I learned about it my jaw dropped to the floor,&#8221; Klausen said in an interview.</p>
<p>Klausen said it is &#8220;unfortunately&#8221; the case that there will probably be protestors at Westergaard&rsquo;s talk. She said she has spoken with Westergaard previously and will say &#8220;hello&#8221; if she can arrange it with security.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you will all find him quite congenial and funny,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But, I&rsquo;m not a great fan of the politicization of this issue.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The issue of the Mohammed funnies was about the only of the very few which caused me to have a disagreement with PJB.  His theory was that if fundamentalist (i.e. a very large majority of) Muslims are that on edge, then we shouldn&rsquo;t do anything to push them over the edge.  My answer was that they should get away from the edge of the cliff. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cartoon.  Chill out.</p>

We live in a nation that prides itself on hard-fought rights of freedom of speech and freedom of religion.</p>
<p>That these people come here and expect us to accommodate them because of implied threats is reason enough to show them the door.</p>
<p>They made the decision to come here. They can leave anytime they don&rsquo;t like our society. I&rsquo;ve said it many times, there are lots of muslim nations in the world where they can stone and execute infidels. Let them live by their standards in their nations.<br>

<p>I would submit that any student who can claim logic in putting such on parity with a discussion of freedom of the press in a secular society (America is not a theocracy) ought to disqualify them for the various scholarships and admittance into any institution of higher learning.  However, there ought to not be any subject that is banned from discussion in such institutions.</p>

		<p>Freedom of the press is constitutionally protected: as it should be. Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like it can leave to their country of preference where these freedoms don&rsquo;t exist. Next subject.</p>

<p>Aw, whip out the violins, boys! But I have some advice for these Brainiacs: DON&rsquo;T ATTEND THE LECTURE! Problem solved! </p>
<p>Of course the reality is, they&rsquo;re not worried about being &#8220;offended.&#8221; They&rsquo;re worried about their fellow students hearing a point of view they don&rsquo;t like! It is very much about free speech, and about controlling speech they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Certainly, it would be unlikely for a white supremacist or a holocaust denier to be a distinguished guest speaker at Yale; hosting individuals who propagate hate is not only a disservice to the minorities that hate is directed towards but to the campus community as a whole.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare like to like here. Forget &#8220;white supremacists.&#8221; If Yale wanted to invite a guest to dispute ANY OTHER RELIGION, ranging from some fringe cult to Catholicism, no one would have a problem with it. It&rsquo;s only Islam that&rsquo;s off-limits.</p>
<p>As far as  Kurt Westergaard, he&rsquo;s fortunate he doesn&rsquo;t have to keep in hiding like Salman Rushdie. Certainly the invective being directed towards him by these students and others doesn&rsquo;t help. And notice that the Muslims, as usual, are protesting a cartoonist and a writer, NOT the religious intolerance and violence of their own comrades around the world!</p>

		<p>Question Diversity:<br>
I was conflicted about Buchanan&rsquo;s defense of the Muslim behavior. On the one hand, Muslims being violent really doesn&rsquo;t shock me and I don&rsquo;t accept cartoons as an excuse. I do however, think that Buchanan was sympathizing with religious people being demeaned by leftists who love to mock Christianity in this country and call it &#8220;art&#8221; and then act like they are defending some sacred freedom. Remember &#8220;piss-christ&#8221; paid for by your tax dollars? Of course Christians demonstrated, they didn&rsquo;t riot or threaten to behead people. <br>
Furthermore leaders in the Middle-East used these cartoons to whip their masses into an anti-western frenzy. How else would they have seen the cartoons? Reading the Danish papers? Muslims in Europe sent word back to their brethren that someone, somewhere, was denigrating their prophet. Which brings us to the real problem, Muslims in Europe. </p>

		<p>Its hard to find something that doesn&rsquo;t upset Mohammed&rsquo;s minions. If they don&rsquo;t like what happens in this country why do they come here in the first place. But a better question is why do we let them in. I&rsquo;m sure millions like me would be tickled pink if we never saw another muslim. Islam is a faith of throat cutters and the so-called peaceful muslims can be trusted about as far as one could drop kick an anvil!</p>

		<p>I have a first amendment right to laugh my head off while looking at these cartoons. If Moslems don&rsquo;t like it, they can leave the country.

		<p>When Westergaard gets done with his speaking tour he should write a book entitled &#8220;The Longest 15 Minutes&#8221;. When that runs out he can draw another cartoon and start the whole process over again. His second book could be titled &#8220;15 More Minutes&#8221; or &#8220;The Longest 30 Minutes&#8221;. I sure hope he has fun at Yale where a hostile audience is kinda the point. The only question is &#8220;Can we get this on video?&#8221; The protests, the crying, the screaming, the outrage, students comforting one another, I want it all. Warning to all attendees: Comedians can deal out ridicule like a fireman deals out water. If your feelings are already hurt, do not provoke the comedian. Mommy and Daddy did not send you to Yale to see you on youtube throwing a temper tantrum. </p>

		<p>  Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, that we allow people into our country from all over the world who despise us and the concept of freedom. They come here and live a life they couldn&rsquo;t live in their own country regardless of how much money they have. And we elect people to our legislative and executive branches who side with our enemies, and take our hard earned money to fund the efforts to undermine our culture. Funny, yes. I laugh, but the laughter turns to bile in my mouth. And as always, I wonder, what are we going to do about it?</p>

		<p>I teach in a college in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>This year, 2009, our intake will be of lower academic attainment than in previous years because many of the young men who would ordinarily have enrolled in our college are flying off to the U.S.A.</p>
<p>King Abdullah has decreed that Saudi students who can get accepted by any - ANY - university or college in the U.S.A. [and a few other civilized countries on a short approved list] will have their fees paid AND receive a stipend for dayu-to-day living expenses.</p>
<p>Yale, Harvard and Princeton can, and will, pick and choose who they do or do not accept but the sort of universities attended by Sarah Palin will be delighted to accept Saudis in platoon, company and batallion strength without too many hard questions being asked.</p>
<p>Just what effect this influx of Saudi students will have on these colleges and universities remains to be seen. </p>
