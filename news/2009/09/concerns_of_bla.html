<h1><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601074&amp;sid=agUnJfnW_IBU">Concerns of Black House Members Helped Spur Rebuke of Wilson</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Rowley and Brian Faler, Bloomberg News, Sept. 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A plea by California Representative Laura Richardson that House Democrats respond after Republican Joe Wilson shouted &#8220;you lie&#8221; at President Barack Obama last week helped spur her party&rsquo;s leaders to action. </p>
<p>The &#8220;careful but passionate&#8221; words delivered at a House Democratic caucus the morning after Wilson&rsquo;s outburst by a black lawmaker who rarely speaks at such meetings carried such an impact that &#8220;you couldn&rsquo;t ignore that message and that input,&#8221; Representative John Larson, the Democratic caucus chairman recalled yesterday. </p>
<p>Larson, of Connecticut, made his comment after the House voted 240-179 to admonish Wilson for his interruption of Obama&rsquo;s speech to a joint session of Congress. The vote was largely along party lines, with 12 Democrats opposing the resolution while seven Republicans supported it. Five Democrats voted &#8220;present.&#8221; </p>
<p>After Obama&rsquo;s Sept. 9 speech on his push for an overhaul of the U.S. health-care, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California tried to shift the focus the next day from the attention Wilson&rsquo;s outburst was garnering. Noting that the South Carolina lawmaker had apologized, Pelosi told reporters Sept. 10 that &#8220;it&rsquo;s time for us to talk about health care.&#8221; </p>
<p>Not all of her fellow Democrats agreed with Pelosi&rsquo;s assessment, including Richardson, 47. The second-term member who represents Long Beach said she spoke up at the weekly caucus meeting that same day because &#8220;leadership didn&rsquo;t say something strong&#8221; about &#8220;what they were going to do&#8221; in response to Wilson&rsquo;s outburst. </p>
<p>It was &#8220;the elephant in the room that we had not dealt with,&#8221; and &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t think it was OK to think it would go away,&#8221; she said yesterday in a telephone interview after the House vote. </p>
<p>During her behind-closed-doors speech to House colleagues, Richardson recalls saying that &#8220;this country has taken on a display of hate, a display of rage a display of unwillingness to even consider and be open to change.&#8221; </p>
<p>Richardson said she was concerned that Wilson&rsquo;s outburst showed &#8220;we have crossed the line of it becoming dangerous if we as members are going to scream at one another.&#8221; </p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t ascribe any racial motivation to Wilson&rsquo;s comment, though other black lawmakers who pushed for a rebuke of Wilson said they believed that Obama wouldn&rsquo;t have been heckled during his speech if he were white. </p>
<p>&#8220;No other president in history has been called out in a joint session,&#8221; Diane Watson, a California Democrat, said yesterday before the House vote. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the most ludicrous statement I&rsquo;ve read on the whole &#8220;You lie!&#8221; story. I&rsquo;m certain that Joe &#8220;The Chompers&#8221; Biden or that wrinkly old flab bag Hillary Clinton would have elicited equally derisive or worse reactions had either one of them attempted to make the same pitch that THe Messiah tried to make.</p>

		<p> The &#8220;Black Caucus&#8221; and their groveling White minions didn&rsquo;t want an apology from Joe Wilson because of any &#8220;violation of House decorum.&#8221; They wanted to force a White man who had dared to speak truth to power, to kowtow and eat humble pie. Wilson wouldn&rsquo;t do it, knowing full well he was guilty of nothing worse than bad manners, and it drove them to distraction that they couldn&rsquo;t make him crack. They couldn&rsquo;t make him pull an Imus, or do anything else to accept &#8220;blame&#8221; for something that was neither spoken nor intended. Of course the fact that he was once a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans   &mdash;   a perfectly legitimate organization with many chapters   &mdash;   gave them a handy hook from which to hang their bogus &#8220;racism&#8221; accusation.</p>
<p> And it&rsquo;s good that someone has written a history of the Congress that proves it wasn&rsquo;t always this Kabuki play that we witness nowadays. Quite frankly, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing a good old-fashioned donnybrook on the House floor just once, instead of all this phony &#8220;courtesy.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I know who Laura Richardson is. She is a politician from Long Beach. She was on the Long Beach city council and was corrupt even then. She has always used race, to get her way. This is what white Americans have to look forward to, unless they so serioulsy ever decide to wake up.</p>

		<p>The black House members are such fools they will eventually destroy themselves with their unreasonable conduct and demands.</p>
<p>A white backlash is growing.</p>
<p>Thank you, Obama.  The far right said they were glad he got elected, because it would awaken people to black racism, and it has done just that.  And, the anti-black sentiment hasn&rsquo;t even reached its peak yet.</p>

		<p>Emotionally, I can&rsquo;t help siding with Laura Richardson in this case, because I hate to see civility go down the tubes.</p>
<p>But to imagine that the sad wreckage this country has become will be cleaned up by people acting civilly is a view even beyond the reach of my naivete.</p>

		<p>Normally you hear about a vote going along party lines, but this sounds more like a vote along racial lines. </p>
<p>Remember how  the Republicans acted when Trent Lott was called a racist? They were falling all over themselves to be the first to denounce Lott as a racist for fear of being labeled a racist themselves. The Democrats expected the same thing to happen with Joe Wilson, but it didn&rsquo;t. Why? </p>
<p>Saul Alinsky in his book &#8220;Rules For Radical&#8221; wrote, that a conflict that drags on too long becomes a drag. This racial conflict that the left is creating has gone on too long and is becoming a drag. This race baiting has gotten to the point where it is loosing it&rsquo;s effectiveness. The left needs to find another tactic. They are sounding like a broken record.</p>

		<p>Decent hard working black famlies are insulted and shamed by the racial antics of a senile ex-president, an ever willing  to &#8220;wallow&#8221; in victimhood congress, and the fool media who report anything apart from the truth.</p>
<p>God bless the freedom loving hard working Americans who despise the marxist and racists among us.  Political advantage will wain as the left wingers parade the lies and false accusations against truth.</p>

		<p>Seriously&hellip; does it get any sillier than this? Rebuking a Congressman for calling a perceived liar a liar? If Wilson sees Obama as an outright liar, most all of those people so adamantly against Obama&rsquo;s ridiculous health care proposal see him the same way. Given Obama&rsquo;s withholding of salient little details. Like a lack of enforcement and control to keep illegal aliens from getting into the healthcare program. </p>
<p>Considering Obama had several meetings&hellip; with Calderon, with La Raza, with other immigration activist groups&hellip; tell me WHY I should take Obama&rsquo;s (or anyone else&rsquo;s word) he wasn&rsquo;t lying through his teeth by hiding lack of enforcement, the inability to verify the legitimacy of those wanting to get into the program.</p>

		<p>Harumphty beat me to it, and I believe wholeheartedly that he is correct. I have said many times that since the 1960&rsquo;s, every generation of Americans in every facet of our society - from the ghetto criminal to the working class to high society - has become ruder, sloppier, more violent, more short-tempered, less patient and much more ill-mannered. The manner of dress, decorum, language, as well as standards in everything from education to sports  has deteriorated because of liberals&rsquo; obsession with &#8216;self esteem&rsquo;, &#8216;self image&rsquo;, and focusing on how special each individual is. Well, let me give you a clue: none of us are special except to a very few people; family &amp; close friends. And none of us are more special than the next guy. Teaching &#8216;self esteem&rsquo; instead of English has created arrogant, ignorant, selfish generations who have rarely been told &#8216;no&rsquo; and can&rsquo;t handle it when they are. They have no life experience learned as a child from winning, losing, learning to share, learning patience, compromise or earning self respect instead of demanding it. Without learning to conduct oneself within reasonable and appropriate behavior, several generations of so-called adults now are parents and grandparents of kids who are even less mature.</p>
<p>Combine all that with the speed at which society spins, absurd &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; restraints, a totally warped sense of justice from the high to the lower courts brought about by EOE forcing the employment of totally unqualified personnel, I see people in every walk of life just hanging on by a thread, ready to explode at just one more frustration; one more absurd rule, one more ridiculous injustice. We see everyone getting away with obnoxious, rude behavior, and even those of us who were taught better are tired of being the few who act with reason, common sense and manners. That certainly includes the last several generations of politicians.</p>
<p>The overall civility of American society has gone down the toilet.</p>

		<p>There are only three political divisions in the United States:  Blacks and their pro-black-white-faction, mestizos, and whites.</p>
<p>And faring worse than anybody, during the eminent tumultuous times, will be the pro-black-white-sub-group and nobody could be more deserving.</p>
<p>Their locations and names should be marked on a giant national  map with red pins for constant reference, until everybody knows who they are and where they are by instant recall.</p>
