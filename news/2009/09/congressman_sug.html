<h1>Congressman Suggests People Will Don &#8216;White Hoods&rsquo; If Wilson Not Rebuked</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FOX News, September 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Joe Wilson&rsquo;s outburst last week is drawing new recriminations from his colleagues, with a member of the Congressional Black Caucus suggesting that a failure to rebuke the South Carolina Republican is tantamount to supporting the most blatant form of organized racism in American history.</p>
<p>In an obvious reference to the Ku Klux Klan, Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said Tuesday that people will be putting on &#8220;white hoods and white uniforms again and riding through the countryside&#8221; if emerging racist attitudes, which he says were subtly supported by Wilson, are not rebuked. He said Wilson must be disciplined as an example.</p>
<p>The charged comments come as the House is preparing to take further action against Wilson. House Democratic leaders decided to formally discipline him Tuesday afternoon for jeering President Obama during last week&rsquo;s joint session of Congress.</p>
<p>Wilson bellowed &#8220;You lie!&#8221; as Obama delivered his address.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While he has been widely condemned by colleagues on both sides of the aisle for breaching protocol, some have gone a step further and accused Wilson of being racially motivated.</p>
<p>Johnson seemed to reference the protests held in Washington, D.C., on Saturday in making his claim. While many protesters were there to demonstrate against big government and federal over-spending, Johnson argued that a &#8220;fringe&#8221; element is motivated by race and that Wilson &#8220;winked&#8221; at that fringe with his behavior.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The resolution is &#8220;privileged,&#8221; meaning whenever it is introduced the measure goes to the front of the legislative line. It is unclear who will call up the measure.</p>
<p>A &#8220;resolution of disapproval&#8221; is not one of the four forms of discipline typically meted out in the House. The most commonly used means of punishment are expulsion, censure, reprimand or fine.</p>
<p>For instance, in 1997, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was both reprimanded and fined for his book deal. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., was reprimanded in 1990 for ethical breaches tied to a male prostitute. Republicans tried to censure Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., in 2007 for comments he made on the House floor about President Bush. But Democrats voted to set aside that effort.</p>

		<p>Saying someone is lying does not equate to racism. This just goes to show that some will resort to namecalling at the drop of a hat. That&rsquo;s fine because I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s intimidating anyone. And the more they do it the more people will see through it.</p>

<p>And if the liberals don&rsquo;t believe in such a thing as &#8220;race&#8221;, then why do they use the word &#8220;racism&#8221;?  Why is there still a Congressional Black Caucus or &#8220;whiteness studies&#8221; (anti-white education) if &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t exist&#8221;?  Liberals want it both ways.</p>

		<p>Those who argue that Wilson&rsquo;s comment was racially motivated are in fact racists themselves. Because Wilson is White, and they see his White skin, something starts swirling around in those cataclysmic minds of theirs and their immediate thought process is:</p>
<p>&#8220;White man disagree with black man. White man RACIST! ATTACK, ATTACK!!!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well said Fred, I think that&rsquo;s it in a nutshell. Keep screaming &#8220;Waycist&#8221; every time someone does not agree with Obama and you will very soon be on a ticket with ever decreasing legitimacy. Your best weapon against &#8220;whitey&#8221; will very soon become your own petard, with which you will be hoisted. </p>

		<p>That SOB should be tossed out on his ass. Can you imagine a White Congressman saying &#8221; Well I guess that soon Blacks will be wielding their Assegais, Knobkerries and Cow skin shields.&#8221;<br>
The conflagration is near.</p>
<p> Blacks love to play the victim role as if they are the innocent Eloi about to be ravaged by the White Morlocks while in fact they have turned this society into one of the most dangerous of what used to be the First World. That&rsquo;s the truth and it&rsquo;s the truth everyplace they exist.</p>

		<p>Joe W is just telling it as it is.<br>
If Obama is lying someone must pull him up &amp; say &#8216;no more deceit &amp; lying&rsquo;.  Why should he be allowed to get away with it for the sake of decorum. If he&rsquo;s not told to stop he&rsquo;ll carry on deceiving the electorate, who I think have been brainwashed for decades, until he gets his laws thru.</p>

		<p>This is nothing more than that a black President is beyond reproach and simply cannot be criticized.  Whether it is black obsessives, or the left-wing &#8220;nutroots&#8221; in general (there is a big overlap between the two), they are getting so shrill, and hateful, and given to invective as of late that one would think that Democrats don&rsquo;t control the Presidency, House or Senate.</p>

		<p>Sometimes when politicians make promises, whether they are kept depends on being supported by the politicians that follow. I&rsquo;m thinking of Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s promise that further illegal immigration would be stopped following the amnesty in the &rsquo;80s. Another promise was made by many top Democrats in congress in 1965 that immigration numbers would not be increased, immigration would be evenly spread from countries around the world, and that immigration would be carefully scrutinized so that problems would not be allowed to grow.</p>
<p>Has Obama ever felt a responsibility that these promises be enforced? It doesn&rsquo;t appear so which means he has helped to make liars out of those politicians.</p>

		<p>I just donated $10 to Wilson, wish I could do more, but if we all do a little, we can make a big noise.  We ALL need to get up and start standing up for each other however we can.  I think we should start targeting the sponcors of the &#8220;news&#8221; programs that continuously lie about what is going on in this country, like with this ACORN stuff.  It&rsquo;s not enough to just play defense anymore.  We have to start speaking up for each other with our wallets, our pens, our phones, our computers, our votes and last but not least, with our time.</p>

		<p>While I don&rsquo;t think the way Joe Wilson rebuked the president was right (it should have been done in a press conference or press release), the content of his message was just fine.</p>
<p>Related to this, Facebook had an ad for an anti-Joe Wilson group running, to which I replied to Facebook by saying, each time it came up, basically, &#8220;Joe Wilson was right&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It is ever more apparent that the election to President of Barrack Obama, may yet prove to be one of the more fortuitous moments in recent history for White racial awareness! This knee-jerk howling about &#8220;racism&#8221; or thinly-veiled claims of bigotry of one stripe or another is just the type of thing that many fence-stadling Whites(read - most of middle America)detest. More and more are awakening to the race flim-flam as it pertains to Black America. Even some racially cluess Whites are beginning to see the game being played and are realizing that they have been the useful pawns in the victory of greatr black chauvanism. </p>
<p>Keep it us Obamites! You may well rouse Whites from their racial-consciousness coma yet!    </p>

		<p>Action taken by the House against Rep. Wilson is beyond the pale (no pun intended).</p>
<p>This only serves to highlight more evidence of partisan double-standard, and further divides the country.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, Rules of Alinsky, no. 12, perhaps:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.&#8221; Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions. (This is cruel, but very effective. Direct, personalized criticism and ridicule works.) </p>

		<p>Joe Wilson violated the House&rsquo;s rules designed to reinforce decorum and the status quo.  What we need, therefore, are MORE rules violations. This corrupt institution, this governmental feudal caste bent on the genocide of White Americans, NEEDS to fall of its own misdeeds.  Let it rot. Let it collapse into ruin. The status quo is our enemy.</p>

		<p>Maine Senator Susan Collins has been the only person to mention that there was a lot of sarcastic comments, laughter and chatter coming from the Democrats&rsquo; side of the aisle previous to Rep. Wilson&rsquo;s outburst.</p>
<p>Though Rep. Wilson opinion was right, regardless of who holds the positions, there should be a strict sense of decorum in such a session. That includes BOTH sides. However, a total lack of civility. loss of manners, and an overwhelming sense of frustration, anger, resentment, impatience, entitlement, and lack of discipline has overtaken our entire country. In every facet of American life, rudeness &amp; violence now rule. Even people our age, who were taught better and have lived respectfully are getting fed up with being backed into a corner and overtaken.</p>

		<p>Virtually any ethics or moral theology course begins with the statement:&#8221;A half truth is a whole lie.&#8221;  The Democrats seem to deal almost entirely with half-truths, which are lies.  Certainly, in this case it was so.  Although Obama&rsquo;s bill does not specifically provide health care for illegals, it has a loophole you can drive a Mack truck through, in that it forbids health care providers from investigating the immigration status of patients, and forbids the reporting of illegals to the ICE.</p>
<p>Obama should be censured for his lies.  Wilson should be praised for telling the truth.</p>

		<p>Most all blacks are anti-white racists.  Their jealousy and resentment of whites has developed into an intense hatred.  That&rsquo;s pretty plain to see.  And, of course, that&rsquo;s why there are so many black on white mob attacks.</p>
<p>Since that&rsquo;s the situation, the best way to counter charges of racism is to deny them, then point out the accuser wouldn&rsquo;t be charging racism if he weren&rsquo;t racist himself.</p>
<p>For example, take this Hank Johnson.  Like all blacks and self-hating whites, all he has to do is utter the charge &#8220;racist&#8221; to a white and the white winds up defending himself so vigorously it&rsquo;s quite painful to watch, especially knowing that it is the accuser who is the real racist.</p>
<p>The charge of &#8220;racist&#8221; directed at Lewis by Jonson should have been answered this way:  &#8220;Unfortunately, Mr. Johnson is so anti-white and racist himself he can see nothing BUT racism from any white.  The fact that he belongs to the CBC whose interests are concerned soley with all things black and nothing else speak volumes about this man&rsquo;s biases.</p>
<p>&#8220;I submit that Mr. Johnson is an anti-white racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say something similar every time the racist charge comes up, and I guarantee these blacks and self-hating whites will think twice before whining again.</p>

<p>That is an excellent response! </p>
<p>Rather than letting the dreaded &#8220;R&#8221;-word reduce them to palpitations and convulsions, people need to remain unfazed by it.  What&rsquo;s to fear? </p>
<p>Instead of rushing to make denials and sniveling apologies, they should look the accuser in the eye and calmly say, &#8220;So what?&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re accustomed to sending anyone into a panic with the R&#8221;-word. They won&rsquo;t be expecting that surprise. Ha!  Let your accusers go into convulsions for a change!</p>
