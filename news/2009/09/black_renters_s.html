			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Egelko, San Francisco Chronicle, September 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Low-income African American renters suing the city of Antioch for allegedly trying to drive them out of federally subsidized housing say a new study backs up their charge that police targeted them for special patrols and pressured landlords to evict them.</p>
<p>The report by criminologist Barry Krisberg [president of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, a private research organization.] said Antioch&rsquo;s police Community Action Team, established in July 2006 to patrol high-crime neighborhoods, has disproportionately concentrated on subsidized Section 8 housing for the poor, and even more so on black tenants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas Beatty, a lawyer for the city, said Monday that the police team responds to complaints about crime, drugs, abandoned cars, property maintenance and other problems and is unaware of the residents&rsquo; race before arriving at the scene.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The federal court suit was filed in July 2008 as a proposed class action on behalf of about 800 African Americans living in Section 8 housing in Antioch, where blacks make up about 15 percent of the city&rsquo;s 100,000 residents.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs said city officials had reacted to a near-doubling of the black population in five years by forming a squad of police that searched their homes illegally and warned landlords they could be held responsible for tenants&rsquo; misconduct.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During that time [mid 2006 to the start of 2009], the study said, 48 percent of the households designated by the police Community Action Team for enforcement activity were occupied by Section 8 tenants. African Americans made up 56 percent of the Section 8 households and 68 percent of those designated by police for contact, the report said.</p>
<p>The study also found that police were more likely to send letters to landlords, warning of liability for tenant misconduct, in Section 8 households than in others, and much more likely to refer black households to the county Housing Authority for alleged crimes than non-black households.</p>
<p>However, the Housing Authority was much less likely to find grounds to remove African Americans from Section 8 housing than tenants of other racial backgrounds, Krisberg said.</p>

		<p>Look at the recent ATLANTIC MONTHLY magazine article on Section Eight residents, the proliferation of them into formerly safe, non-black areas, and how crime rates sour after the federal government imposes these criminal recipients by placing them next top taxpayers in their new neighborhoods.  It is a fact. There is no dispute.</p>
<p>The ATLANTIC MONTHLY is not a conservative or even moderate magazine, they are seriously liberal. And yet they chose to tell the truth and expose the federally-subsidized misery that plagues us with our own confiscated tax dollars.</p>
<p>Horrible.</p>

		<p>Of course, no mention in the consultants report of the crime rate among section 8 versus non, which would give a true picture of whether the section 8&rsquo;s are being &#8220;unfairly&#8221; targeted. Of course, lawyers, and therefore judges, are innumerate. Unfortunately, this is how &#8220;empathy&#8221; effects justice.</p>

		<p>I bet you a Krona to a Krispy Kreme that this Antioch P.D. Community Action Team was founded because some black citizens group wanted a crackdown of black crime in Section 8 and public housing.  In other words, that is the rock, and the predictable complaints in this article is the hard place.</p>
<p>As for me, black whining has reached an impossible crescendo, so if I were in charge, my only recourse would be to do what I think is right.  No matter what you do, blacks will whine anyway, no making them happy.  Hell is a place where there is a total absence of reason.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s mandatory reading.  Congratulations to the Atlantic Monthly for telling a truth that most liberals would love to suppress.</p>

		<p>There is nothing wrong with section 8 housing that couldn&rsquo;t be cured by passing laws that would make a person PERMANENTLY ineligible for the program if they have ever been convicted of a crime.  Better, force them all to undergo monthly drug testing.  A positive test makes them ineligible for a year.</p>
<p>Those banned from public housing would be subject to imprisonment if they were anywhere on said properties for any reason (ie can&rsquo;t live with their &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; in properties like that).</p>
<p>It would dramatically change section 8 housing for the better and make it serve its original purpose.  No longer would it be a source of urban blight.</p>
<p>Of course, criminals need housing to.  Might I suggest permanent housing in a SuperMax facility for these.</p>

		<p>To add to ward9son&rsquo;s post:</p>
<p>There was an investigative report on television about two years ago. It documented a husband-and-wife team, both uber-liberals, that tracked section 8 residents who&rsquo;d been &#8220;displaced&#8221; when their crime-ridden housing projects were condemned and destroyed. </p>
<p>The section 8 tenants were documented on a computer map when they obtained new housing, mainly in the next closest population center. </p>
<p>Another (unrelated) research group from the NIJ (?) came along tracking crime trends. They mapped crime increase over time.</p>
<p>No great shock, but the two maps were nearly identical overlays. The discovery was unintentional and led to much hand-wringing. </p>

		<p>Antioch: may I ring the memory bell without research? 1: Where the Duggan? girl was discovered, with her 2 kids, after 15 years with the sexual predator?  2: Where the curious media found a staggering per-capita residency of Registered Sex Offenders?  3: East of San Fransisco? Like we thought Oakland was too far east for safety.  Maybe we should just wall it off, run I.D. checks at the departure gate, and schedule bulldozer drag races for 2012. In the meantime, keep the cops safe outside - wasn&rsquo;t it 4 dead by 1 perp in one day recently in Oakland?</p>

Blacks moved in and brought their black behavior. The police had to devote more time and resources to contain typical black behavior. Police accused of racism.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat.</p>

		<p>I have recently considered a move to a mid-size city in the South with a varied ethnic/racial makeup, so was looking at apartments there.  All the complexes were lovely:  well-landscaped, great amenities (pools, fitness center), spacious apartments, etc.  And best of all, there were many affordable ones.  The only thing that was puzzling was that I noticed in more than one of them groups of middle school aged black kids roaming around them.  While checking their literature and postings on their bulletin boards I saw that they subscribed to Section 8.  The only way you could get away from Section 8 was to rent one of the highest priced ones.  So, the key to opting out of having those neighbors was money, pure and simple.  Otherwise a white person has no choice.  Oh, and I talked to a tenent I saw in the parking lot of one of them and asked her if she felt safe there.  She said yes but you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be out in the parking lot at 3am.  Safe, right.  </p>

<p>I seriously doubt that it took much pressure to get the landlords to evict them.  I suspect it took a lot more pressure to get the landlords to rent to them to begin with.</p>

		<p>The alternative here is that the police stop patrolling this high-crime area.  The remaining whites and Asians will leave, property values will plummet, and the Section-8 blacks who have moved there will be back in precisely the sorts of neighborhood they originally thought they had left.</p>
<p>If these folks are not careful about what they wish for, they just might get it.</p>

		<p>A bit off-topic, as a former landlord I can tell you blacks are the worst tenants.</p>
