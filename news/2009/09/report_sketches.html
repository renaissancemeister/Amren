			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>by George!, nj.com, September 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Morristown can become a world leader in sustainable growth  &mdash;  if it scraps local immigration enforcement policies, redevelops the Headquarters Plaza commercial complex, and defines a clear strategy for the future.</p>
<p>Those are among recommendations in a new report from national planning experts who visited Morristown last year.</p>
<p>They maintain that the Morris County seat can become &#8220;the greenest community in New Jersey&#8221; and &#8220;a model for the world,&#8221; with smarter planning and respect for the town&rsquo;s rich history and diversity.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s lacking, according to these experts, is a game plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first step is to develop a defined, cohesive, illustrated vision of Morristown&rsquo;s future. The lack of vision is preventing the acknowledgement of common ground and leading to false dichotomies and unnecessary conflict,&#8221; contends the report. Development and preservation are necessary, yet impossible, &#8220;until there is a defined vision.&#8221;</p>
<p>The document was created pro bono by planners and architects from the American Institute of Architects.</p>
<p>Morristown is among 29 communities nationwide selected by the AIA for its &#8220;Sustainable Design Assessment Team&#8221; study, or SDAT. Alexandria Township and Englishtown are the other New Jersey municipalities in the program.</p>
<p>Working with The College of New Jersey, the Morristown Partnership applied to the AIA on Morristown&rsquo;s behalf in 2007. The Partnership promotes business in downtown Morristown.</p>
<p>Broadly, the survey explored how to improve Morristown&rsquo;s &#8220;sustainability,&#8221; defined as balancing environmental, economic and social concerns in beneficial ways.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2008, SDAT experts met with town officials, residents, business people, clergy and school children and asked them what kind of future they desire. Those meetings culminated in a town meeting, and the report. More public forums are being planned to discuss the findings.</p>
<p>&#8216;A STARTING POINT&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing I&rsquo;m hoping that really resonates is this team making really clear to us as residents and citizens and stakeholders that there is no &#8216;they&rsquo; to turn to or blame. &#8216;They&rsquo; is us. Any stakeholder in the future of the town needs to get into the game,&#8221; Paul [Paul Miller, who runs the Partnership&rsquo;s Step Ahead Morristown sustainability program] said.</p>
<p>There are plenty of conversation-starters in the report, including a veiled poke at Mayor Donald Cresitello&rsquo;s push to deputize police as immigration officers:</p>
<p>&#8220;As Morristown makes headlines for some of the policies that are pursued by its local government, it is in danger of becoming known, fairly or unfairly, as a community of intolerance or even racism,&#8221; the report cautions. Celebrating the town&rsquo;s historically diverse population &#8220;is a key strategy for Morristown&rsquo;s economic sustainability.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE &hellip;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>o Requiring more affordable housing, so town employees can live here.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Much of the report focuses on how Morristown can continue to attract the &#8220;highly educated, talented creative class who drive the local economy as residents and workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>This demographic wants &#8220;interesting kinds of music, food, venues, art galleries, performance spaces, and theaters. The creative class seeks out vibrant, varied nightlife, indigenous street culture, a teeming blend of cafes, sidewalk musicians, small galleries, bistros, and other qualities that contribute to dynamic urban places,&#8221; the report contends.</p>

<p>So what? I wanna Lear jet, a Maseratti, a seaside villa in Cape May, a sixty foot sailing yacht, and twenty nude maidens to peel my grapes and fan me with palm fronds. Only problem is that New Jersey property taxes are too high. </p>

		<p>So it&rsquo;s &#8220;sustainable&#8221; to get flooded by an unlimited number of illegal immigrants.  As always, enforcing immigration law is called  &#8220;racism&#8221;.  I sure hope the people in Morristown have to guts to stand up against that proposal.</p>
<p><i>o Requiring more affordable housing, so town employees can live here.</i></p>
<p>This would be a fine thing if it was just American citizens who are actually town employees getting that affordable housing (Morristown is an expensive place to live).  But we all know it will go to those precious illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>My gosh, what an apt description of the preferences of childless yuppies who will never put down roots and will never reproduce.  Perhaps to attract stable, middle-plus class people with children Morristown should emphasize excellent schools, low crime, low taxes, and an overall high quality of life.  This demographic will be stable and contribute to the community for a long time unlike the feckless yuppie crowd.  Also, what productive taxpayer in their right mind wants to be in an area that is swarming with illegal immigrants?  Even the yuppies will flee that scene.</p>
<p>The most laughable line in this whole article is the one about the desirability of having an &#8220;indigenous street culture&#8221;.  I have no idea why the American Institute of Architects desires to import this aspect of third-world existence (Calcutta/Rio/Juarez in Morristown????), however, be assured it will do wonders to the property values of the buildings the AIA will build there.</p>

		<p>Only a couple of years ago, I resided in Morris Township, which borders Morristown.  Within the past three years, I slept in the Market Street Mission homeless men&rsquo;s shelter, too. Morristown does not need any college&rsquo;s &#8220;sustainability&#8221; plan!!! Morristown is doing just fine the way it is right now!!!! I was unable to find a room to rent in Morristown because most of the rooms were taken by illegal aliens.</p>

		<p>My commute has increased from 30 mins to almost an hour because of the population explosion. To see my home state invaded, occupied and destroyed makes me angry.  Sometimes when I am in a store I get welled up listening to all the non-English being spoken and all the foreign faces, it makes me so sad.  I know how the French must have felt when the Nazis marched through Paris.</p>
<p>And flip-flops.  People wear them everywhere.  How third world can you get?  When I was a young person you only saw flip-flops on the beach and boardwalk.  Now - all over the place!!  The market, mall, Post Office just everywhere.  No one can wear shoes it seems.  Another sign of collapse.</p>
<p>NJ also requires &#8220;affordable housing&#8221; mixed in with every new housing development.  Mixed in, not just a seperate section.  Or municipality can pay &#8220;diverse&#8221; cities to take some of the low-income housing units that would be required.  Of course, if our &#8220;diverse&#8221; cities were liveable, we wouldn&rsquo;t need to destroy valuable farmland and wooded areas for new housing.  Look what diversity has done to Trenton, Newark, Atlantic City, Princeton Boro, Burlington City and Vineland.  Want the 1945 fire-bombed Dresden experience?  Visit Camden.  You could film a World War there - no set dressers needed!</p>
<p>I am sick of these know-it-all diversity freaks.  The AIA should keep to architecture and away from social planning.  Amazing how whites from the 1650s through 1965 were able to build a thriving, liveable society without diversity experts.  And how since 1980 everything has gone downhill.  Never thought I would live in a cross between Mexico and Bombay without ever moving!</p>

		<p>This &#8216;creative class&rsquo; mumbo-jumbo is a sly way of saying lots of slackers concentrating in urban areas.  Maybe one in a hundred is truly creative, and the rest are hacks attempting to live off the system.</p>
<p>They truly want to live a peter-pan existence, in a multi-cultural theme-park cityscape for adult children.  They&rsquo;re not even aware of their own racism, when they reduce other cultures to ethnic food, costumes, music and little else. </p>

		<p>Huh, sustainable growth of third world immigrants, who use an inordinate amount of taxpayer social services is important, when this nation is at the brink of an economic meltdown. Makes perfect sense to me.</p>

		<p><i>• Redeveloping the fortress-like Headquarters Plaza commercial complex into a more accessible mix of retail, commercial and housing units.</i></p>
<p>This type of urban architecture arose in the 70&rsquo;s as a defense against urban riots. We have a couple of these types of buildings in Buffalo. They aren&rsquo;t fortress-like, they are fortresses.</p>
<p><i>This demographic wants &#8220;interesting kinds of music, food, venues, art galleries, performance spaces, and theaters. The creative class seeks out vibrant, varied nightlife, indigenous street culture, a teeming blend of cafes, sidewalk musicians, small galleries, bistros, and other qualities that contribute to dynamic urban places,&#8221; the report contends.</i></p>
<p>This is a deceptive and superficial assessment.</p>
<p>White people do like and want culture venues. However, they only want these things when they know they&rsquo;re safe. What they want is the appearance of diversity without the dangers of diversity. It&rsquo;s one thing to visit Chinatown. It&rsquo;s another thing to live there. It&rsquo;s also another thing to transform your community into Chinatown.</p>
<p>Vibrant diversity takes a back seat to feeling and being safe.<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love these liberals with their silly little euphemisms?</p>
<p>My last encounter with &#8220;indigenous street culture&#8221; was in Houston a couple of years ago when some &#8220;urban youth&#8221; produced a knife and demanded money from me. I reached under my coat and pointed a .38 at his head, causing him to flee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indigenous street culture&#8221; is the reason my family and I moved from Houston to a small town in the Texas hill country.  </p>

		<p>     They are putting in a new people in Morristown.Blame the Italian contractors, who hire these invaders- pay them a pittance,and take no taxes out. It&rsquo;s left for the rest of us to pick iup the bill for health care, education and basic social services.I have never seen a more disloyal group than these contractors. They will get their pound of flesh and damn this country in the bargain.</p>
