			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Watkins, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Sept. 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The wildfire that has ravaged a national forest near Los Angeles has burned one plant species that authorities were happy to see go: marijuana, lots of it.</p>
<p>The fire destroyed an untold number of marijuana plantations in the Angeles National Forest, a growing hub for pot-growing operations in California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cultivation of marijuana, often by Mexican drug cartels, is rife in California&rsquo;s national forests, and the steep, scrub-covered canyons only a short drive from Los Angeles are no exception.</p>
<p>In the days the fire was burning most ferociously, several apparent pot plantation laborers were spotted spilling from the forest and walking down highways away from the flames, Abner said.</p>
<p>And it appears they are already starting to return to the forest.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a team of firefighters working near a popular and badly burned recreational area high in the rugged San Gabriel Mountains found singed water lines with new ones already lying alongside them. Fearing for their safety, the firefighters called the sheriff&rsquo;s office, whose deputies arrested a Mexican national found hiding out with a .22-caliber rifle, Abner said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also been blamed for starting fires.</p>
<p>Marijuana growers with possible ties to Mexican drug cartels caused an 88,650-acre wildfire in Santa Barbara County last month, investigators said. That blaze was sparked by a cooking device left by suspected drug traffickers at an encampment.</p>
<p>The current fire is not thought to have been started by marijuana cultivation, and investigators are looking for an arsonist thought to have set the blaze next to a mountain highway. {snip}</p>
<p>Abner said the marijuana growing areas are manned almost invariably by Mexican aliens, some of whom have been tricked into tending the plants. He said some claimed to have been standing outside a Home Depot in Los Angeles, looking for day labor, when a van pulled up and asked them if they knew anything about gardening.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next thing they know they are up there for five weeks,&#8221; Abner said, afraid or unable to come down from the hillside and return to the city. &#8220;They often can&rsquo;t tell you who hired them&hellip; .   They just tell you they have been paid to put water on the weeds.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Another illegal pot growing operation</p>
<p>PRESS RELEASE from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department</p>
<p>New Cuyama - On Friday, 04-17-09, at approximately 11:30 a.m., two adults, who had been camping in the Aliso Park area west of New Cuyama, came across an active marijuana garden. While in the area, the campers were approached by two Hispanic male adult subjects who were tending to the marijuana garden.</p>
<p>The subjects attempted to converse with the campers, however due to a language barrier, they were unsuccessful. The subjects requested that the campers remain in the area, until the arrival of the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; who spoke English. The campers became fearful and packed up their gear and left the area. While the campers were driving down the dirt road, they were approached by a pick up truck traveling the opposite direction. As they passed the truck, they noticed the occupants seemed very interested in them. The truck stopped and the driver exited and waived for the campers to come back. They ignored his request and kept driving, believing he was the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; that the two subjects had referred to earlier. The driver returned to his truck and began chasing the campers down the mountain. During the chase, the truck came dangerously close to the campers&rsquo; vehicle several times.</p>
<p>Once the campers reached the paved road, they were able to distance themselves from the truck and contact law enforcement. A Santa Barbara County Deputy Sheriff obtained the information from the campers and quickly disseminated it to local agencies. A short time later, a Taft Police Officer spotted a truck, matching the description provided by the campers. A traffic stop was conducted and as a result Javier Barragan (DOB 1/31/69) and Jose Lopez (DOB 5/3/71) were contacted. Both subjects were positively identified by the campers, as the persons who chased them down the mountains. The two were taken into custody and a search of the vehicle was conducted. During the search, five high powered rifles, equipped with rifle scopes and numerous rounds of ammunition were found. </p>

		<p>Environmentalists are not concerned about pesticides used by illegal alien pot growers. They are too busy advocating for the importation of more illegal aliens while advocating zero population control for White Americans.</p>
<p>Here is a story about the effects of large scale pot growing on the environment.</p>
<p>Vast tracts of our most treasured public lands, supposedly set aside in perpetuity for Americans, are no longer controlled by the United States government. Instead, they have been invaded and taken over by Mexico&rsquo;s violent criminal drug organizations to grow marijuana. </p>
<p>Even more shocking: Mexican cartels have been growing marijuana for at least 10 years in  Sequoia National Park, one of the crown jewels of the system. Nature-loving hikers are compelled to accept that parts of Sequoia are &#8220;no go zones&#8221; during the growing season.</p>
<p>These Mexican marijuana messes are an ecological disaster. They are not innocent little plots that leave a minimal footprint. They are industrial grow sites, toxic stews where the gangsters use dangerous and illegal chemical herbicides, pesticides and growth hormones that result in long-lasting environmental damage. </p>
<p>National parks are supposed to be protected at the highest standard, preserving them for future generations in a pristine, unspoiled state. But he Mexican infestation has corrupted that idea to its core. </p>
<p>Drug czar John Walters testified to Congress in March that </p>
<p>&#8220;10 acres of forest are damaged for every acre planted with marijuana, with an estimated cost of $11,000 per acre to repair and restore land that has been contaminated with the toxic chemicals, fertilizers, irrigation tubing, and pipes associated with marijuana cultivation.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Mexican gangsters (who are often illegal aliens) routinely cut down trees, divert streams with systems of PVC pipe and poach wildlife for food. Their operations are big business:<br>

		<p>I have lived close to the Angeles National Forest a long time. In my younger years, I camped with my friends in the Sequoia National Forest in California, and the famous Yosemite National Forest,etc. Later I traveled to Western Europe and saw many of the forests there. They are beautiful yes, but more beautiful than the ones in California no, just different.</p>
<p>The only thing that makes me sad, yes, truly sad, is that because of the utterly corrupt,useless, unconcerned and uncaring people we have in government today, so many young people won&rsquo;t be able to enjoy those forests as I did, with my friends, in the time of my youth. We never had to worry about running into some clown with an AK-47, ready to blow us away, because Mexican nationals illegaly in this nation, are being allowed to grow marijuana in an American National Forest. Where&rsquo;s the Green Party? Oh,I forgot,they are more political&#8221;dead wood&#8221;, since they have a platform that essentially agrees with illegal immigration. </p>
<p>Speaking so personally might not be in good style, but it&rsquo;s the only way I can get across the feelings I have when I read these stories. My utter disdain, for the mostly liberal Democrat clowns that govern in the California State Capitol of Sacramento, knows no bounds.</p>

		<p>This is radical but the solution to this is to legalize everything let the drug companies make the crack, the coke, the meth and the marijane. Then tax it ostrasize violators of the drug code by getting rid of them and letting them go ahead and destroy their lives. </p>
<p>This would get he poppy growers out in the open the tax fed federal government would have another source of revenue and the cartels would be out of business. This is very drastic but we are losing control. </p>

		<p>Have you noticed the anti-tobacco TV adds with obvious &#8220;Liberal&#8221; slant and a push from the Left to legalize marijuana?</p>
<p>One of the reason for that duplicity is that tobacco is being manufactured and distributed by &#8220;evil&#8221; American companies, while marijuana is a product of &#8220;good&#8221; Mexican people. </p>
<p>It does explain a lot, doesn&rsquo;t it?<br>

		<p>The fact that this &#8220;drug&#8221; continues to be criminalized in most States is a travesty.  Alcohol and cigarettes kill a combined 1.6 million Americans every year, and they are perfectly legal.  How many Americans does pot kill?  Legalize it, time to recognize it!

		<p>A great reason for objecting to the use of illegal substances is that it provides income to undesirables. About the only white people who commit crimes anymore are drug dealers or drug abusers, and our two favorite minority groups seem to gain a good part of their wealth from white people&rsquo;s bad habits.</p>
<p>Any time I think of lighting up a joint or snorting a line, the face of some smirking antisocial black or brown thug comes to mind and I lose the urge. Booze, with occasional morning-after aspirin, is the only drug for me.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been posting on an article from Sep 8 about race rioting in a juvenile work camp in Malibu, saying that I rarely see Mexican when I hike in the southern California mountains, and never away from the picnic areas.  Maybe I&rsquo;ve just been lucky.  This is news to me, unemployed WASP.  </p>
<p>The posse commitatus act forbids the military to enforce the law, but who besides the navy seals or green berets are trained and equipped f to deal with these kind of situations?  These people cut off cops heads in Mexico, they&rsquo;d have no trouble killing an American witness.  </p>

 <br>
They already DO! they get arrested, and they can BUY their way out. In Santa Cruz some years ago while I was visiting family, a local Sheriffs deputy went into the woods looking for something, I child I believe, and he detonated a rigged claymore mine that was strapped to a tree. Deputies found LOTS of pot being grown there. But CLAYMORES!!!! that is one nasty remnant from Viet-Nam.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Mexicans who grow, sell, or use drugs in OUR COUNTRY should get exactly the same penalty that an American would get if they did the same thing in Mexico&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I would also say this:</p>
<p>Mexicans who grow, sell, or use drugs in OUR COUNTRY should get exactly the same penalty that an American would get if he did the same thing.</p>
<p>As you know in San Francisco, AKA Sanctuary City USA,  criminal mexicans and central americans are coddled and sent to expensive &#8216;treatment&rsquo; centers for &#8216;juveniles&rsquo; even though they mostly likely are adults  &mdash;  or given light sentences and then released back onto the Streets of San Francisco to create more mayhem:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Danielle Bologna was widowed on June 22 when Edwin Ramos, 21, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, allegedly gunned down her husband, Anthony, and two sons, Matthew and Michael, in a road rage incident when her family was returning from a picnic.  All three died.</p>
<p>The Chronicle reported that Ramos was convicted of two gang-related felonies while a juvenile and remained in San Francisco because the Juvenile Probation Department did not alert federal authorities. San Francisco&rsquo;s 1989 &#8216;City of Refuge&rsquo; ordinance prohibits city agencies from contacting the feds on immigration matters&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>I heard Danielle Bologna on the John &amp; Ken show here in LA a few days after the incident  &mdash;  she had to stop after every few words because she was sobbing so hard, but asked to continue because she was so angry at the idiots in the government.  I remember hearing her mention that no city or government officials, including newsom and feinstein, had contacted her, offered her sympathy, as they had with non-White crime victims.</p>
<p>DA kamala harris decided not to seek the death penatly against ramos.</p>
<p>And as a testament as to how far Kalifornia has fallen, harris is running for attorney general of of the state and SF&rsquo;s mayor, gavin newsom (backed by former president clinton, apparently on hilary&rsquo;s orders because brown &#8216;dissed&rsquo; her) is running for governor.</p>
<p>The most outrageous thing is that newsom has a good chance of winning and probably harris too.</p>

		<p>I do not consider myself a lefty/bleeding heart but I absolutely think marijuana should be legal. It would take all the money out of the product. It would also allow it to be taxed and regulated. How much money bleeds across the border to Mexico due to the criminalization of what is essentially a harmless recreational drug? </p>

		<p>So, we are supposed to believe that if pot is legalized, that the criminals who are growing and selling it are going to get out of an extremely lucrative business, i.e., say to themselves, Pot is now legal, guess there won&rsquo;t be any more money in growing it.  Anybody who thinks that way might just as well have voted for Obama.  Why should they stop growing pot in National Forests; it&rsquo;s land they don&rsquo;t pay taxes on.  What makes anyone think that they will pay taxes on legal pot any more than they pay taxes on illegal pot?  I&rsquo;d advise people on our side (the White side) to stop listening to the idiot arguments of the liberaltarians; that path leads over the same cliff as liberalism.</p>

<p>The powers that be don&rsquo;t want the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; to be won, and they won&rsquo;t legalise any drug.  Dealers at the top of the chain make BILLIONS, and all this money has to go somewhere.  Laundered, placed in offshore accounts, then invested on the stockmarket, in business deals, in property.  The &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; is a huge moneyspinner as well, the same as the &#8220;war on terror&#8221;.  International drug dealing, and the &#8220;fight&#8221; against it  are HUGE business, and if they were taken out of the equation, there would be a big hole in the economies of many different nations.  </p>

Huh? The price is high because it&rsquo;s illegal. Even though the price of illicit drugs is inelastic, were they to become legal the profit potential would be drastically reduced. The margin would be small enough that one could only make money through volume. <br>
Using your logic and economic model there would still be bootleggers and bathtub gin. <br>

		<p>I agree with Cogitator.  I think marijuana should be legalized.  I wish marijuana were legal, so that as an adult over 21, I could buy and possess it without the fear of being arrested, as long as I am responsible enough not to drive my car, handle or fire any of my guns, or operate machinery when I am stoned.</p>
<p>To everyone reading my post, read about the history of the Prohibition Era 1919-1933.  You will then realize that marijuana prohibition is just as much a failure, as was alcohol prohibition.</p>

<p>The WHOLE REASON pot is an &#8220;extremely lucrative business&#8221; is because it IS ILLEGAL. Its called the PROHIBITION PREMIUM (google it). Make something legal and prices fall dramatically. Your logic and reasoning is lost on me. By the way Libertarianism and Liberalism are very, very different things.</p>
