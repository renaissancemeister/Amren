<h1>$30 Million Plan to Save Kids</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rosalind Rossi, Chicago Sun-Times, September 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Using a newfangled probability model, Chicago Public School officials have identified the 1,200 Chicago public high school students most likely to be gunshot victims  &mdash;  and will direct millions in resources to help them this school year, Schools CEO Ron Huberman revealed Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those students most at risk will get a personal &#8220;advocate,&#8221; a social worker and a job in an attempt to turn around their lives and help stem the cycle of student shooting deaths that totaled 37 last school year.</p>
<p>Before a packed room at the City Club, Huberman outlined a broad range of ideas on multiple fronts for this coming school year:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He also expressed interest in the &#8220;Jesuit model&#8221; in which schools are headed by a president instead of a principal with an administrative certificate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Determined to attack the problem, Huberman assigned analysts to study the characteristics of all CPS high school students shot in the last five years. The &#8220;brutal facts,&#8221; he said, are that such kids were more likely to be black males, homeless, special education students and students at alternative schools.</p>
<p>Such kids also tended to be at least two credits behind in high school, to have been absent for more than 40 percent of the school year and to have committed nearly one serious school violation per school year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To encourage safe passage to the 38 schools, the gang boundaries kids must cross on the way to school will be identified so extra parent or police patrols can be deployed to those areas.<br>

		<p>When you were about ready to graduate from high school, members of your class voted on who was most likely to succeed, most likely to become President, most likely to have gender-changing surgery, most likely to join a cult, most likely to cure AIDS, and a whole bunch of other &ldquo;most likelies.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it nice to know that in Chicago, you might win &#8220;most likely to get shot?&#8221;</p>
<p>The main problem with this scheme is that many CPS students who are at risk of being shot (mainly the older ones) already have jobs.  It&rsquo;s called dope dealing, and the armed protection of drug distribution turf.  It&rsquo;s illegal, and illicit, and immoral (depending on your views), but a job nonetheless.</p>
<p>I would think child labor laws mean that the jobs are given to students that are of a certain age or older; I can ill imagine that first-graders will be made to pull the wagon out there in the working world.) </p>
<p>The thing that jumped out at me is $30 million a year for 1,200 students, which divides out to $25,000 a year. If I were in charge, the CPS would spend $30m on its 1,200 smartest students before doing this. If they won&rsquo;t agree to that sensible step, I would rather spend $30m a year on the 1,200 students most likely to shoot somebody.</p>

		<p>unemployment be gone! What a wonderful place to apply American ingenuity, hard work and scientific prowess. That being said, while everyone and his brother is hard at work saving Chicago kids from being shot, who will make money to pay for it all?</p>

<p>Ah yes, another initiative based on another theory. Of course, this time it&rsquo;s sure to work.</p>
<p>I predicted that at some point, every black child would be assigned their own personal couch or mentor (something parents are supposed to do).</p>
<p>My prediction has come true.</p>

Yes, lets get some experts in there to do some analyzing and see if they can find yet another excuse to explain away the all too obvious fact that black males are on average much more violent than white males.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;most likely to be shot&#8221; (or raped, robbed, beaten down for no reason at all) are the few remaining WHITE students in the Chicago public schools. By all means let&rsquo;s spend a little money on them for a change. Of course that would never happen, since this new program is just another ill-disguised gravy train for non-whites. </p>

		<p>I laughed my head off when I heard this idea fron Daley&rsquo;s love child. It will not work. According to the local news media, all victims of gang shootings are innocent victims. They were shot because gang members poor marksmanship skills.<br>
   More money wasted.</p>

		<p>I guess they are just trying to hook the dope dealers an even more lucrative scam  &mdash;  the do nothing government job. Not as glamorous as drug dealing, but you get better hours and a pension plan.</p>

<p>In a lot of cases, the most likely shooter will be a cop or armed citizen in a what may be called a justifiable homicide.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and we continue to try and defy nature by trying to save these people from themselves.  Just once in my life, I would love to see my taxes go into a program that benefits ONLY those that actually pay into the system.</p>
