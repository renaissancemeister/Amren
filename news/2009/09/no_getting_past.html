<h1>No Getting Past Race in America</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily, September 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an attempt to allay the concerns of some white voters, candidate Obama even said that &#8220;to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns  &mdash;  this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>This election was going to be different, he said, &#8220;this time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who serve together, and fight together, and bleed together under the same proud flag.&#8221;</p>
<p>The closest he came to suggesting that an Obama administration would mean a new army of civil rights lawyers at the Justice Department was one well-buried line about &#8220;enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Rev. Wright had been named attorney general instead of Eric Holder, maybe he would try to hire 100 new predatory lawyers, instead of 50-something of them as Holder is planning.</p>
<p>The idea is still the same: America &#8220;is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past&#8221;  &mdash;  the very opposite of what the president said he believed about &#8220;the decency and generosity of the American people&#8221;  &mdash;  so we need the federal government to police our ingrained, intractable racism in every nook and cranny of society.</p>
<p>Holder, with the president&rsquo;s blessing, will now set out to undo the Bush administration&rsquo;s altogether proper emphasis on individual cases of obvious, intentional discrimination, and return the federal government to a 1970s race-war mentality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To the entrenched legal establishment of the federal government, racism is ever and always a one-way street  &mdash;  as well as a problem that never diminishes without the bullying of government lawyers. That is &#8220;a profoundly distorted view of this country,&#8221; and the president last year assured us that he did not subscribe to it.<br>

<p>In other words, Obama is denying that government, judiciary, educational institutions and the mainstream media collectively do indeed perpetuate and spread the one-way street lie that it&rsquo;s only European-Americans who can be racist, and that even the law has effectively enacted this lie onto the Statute Book. </p>
<p>This highly contentious and questionable bearer of the current US <i>Presidency,</i> is knowingly and wilfully laying the ground-work for legalized anti-white race hate by stealth.  There&rsquo;s no doubt about that. <br>

		<p>Africans,muslims,hispanics and asians all knew that the anti-white kenyan bigot in the white house was beyond race. This is why they voted for him.</p>
<p>This election was the first time that the racially transforming post-1965 immigration policy made its effects in politics in a profound way. Simply put, Native Born White Americans were out voted by post-1965 non-whites. It will only get worse from here on in. White Americans voted in the same percentage in previous elections for a Republican candidate- a percentage that shuould have put McCain into the white house. It  happen because of the rapidly  changing racial compolstion of the voting age population.</p>
<p>The Republican has been an active player in the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans. So if you voted for McCain, you voted for a man and a party that wants to bring about the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans as fast as possible. For demographic reasons the Republican party is doomed.</p>
<p>Now in the unlikely event that the Republican party got the majority of hispanic votes, Native Born White Americans would still face rapid race-replacement for the Republican party can only get the hispanic vote by supporting amnesty and very high levels of hispanic LEGAL IMMIGRATION. White Nationlism is the only game in town for Native Born White Americans. </p>

		<p>Given his radical history and his own writings only a complete fool could believe that Obama had any intention to &#8220;get beyond race&#8221;.  But then, this country has a lot of complete fools in it.  At least the white hating New Black Panthers knew what they were voting for.</p>

		<p>Reading this editorial I was reminded of the Duke hoax. Odd response? Well, I would argue not. Remember, the tide really began to turn against the liar and her cohort when Duke parents, and prospective ones, voted with their wallets. Duke applications dropped sharply, parents voiced disdain, and both town and gown began to fear the backlash. If the views contained in this IBD piece gain traction amongst the economic elite, we may look forward to a cross-class realignment of the white vote.</p>

		<p>The greatest threat to peace in this country is black racism.  And now that Obama is in office, and appointed one of the most bigotted blacks in this country as AG, it has quadrupled.</p>
<p>And his other apointees are just as bad.  Van Jones announced that whites deliberately poisoned immigrant farm workers and that whites polluted the environment and moniorities had to endure the contamination.</p>
<p>Go down the list of Obama appointees and you&rsquo;ll note that he has anti-white haters, anglo-haters, out-and-out black anti-white racists, revolutionaries and self-avowed Marxists all around him.  Every one of them can be profiled with proof as some kind of kook, oddball, misfit, or anti-white racist.  </p>
<p>Collectively their goal is to replace the traditional American system with a pro-black brand of state-run government.</p>
<p>And the irony of it all is that they ALL have furnished quotes and videos attesting to their beliefs and intent, yet white fools voted for this disaster in droves.</p>
<p>Things are getting so bad for whites civil war would be an improvement.</p>
<p>Better hope for economic collapse so we&rsquo;ll have an excuse to impeach the annointed one, instead of fighting in the streets with no food to eat.</p>

		<p>The more they say we are racist, the more they make it true.  The issues of racism have not been this big since the &rsquo;60s.</p>
<p>If they really wanted to end racism, they would not be trying so hard to suppress whites.  The view that in order for them to win, whitey has to loose.  Our feminist sisters also think that they must take-over, not take a share.</p>
<p>So we must, for our own suvival eliminate them; every pig, every cow, until it is done.  Because they can&rsquo;t tolerate our existence.</p>
<p>As the world becomes a jungle, the law of the jungle will prevail.</p>

		<p>Perhaps, in the future and before any voting takes place, some sort of &#8220;information spreading&#8221; of a candidate that we Whites can vote for overwhelmingly and not dilute our votes in futile personal choices. We should/MUST find a qualified, WHITE candidate and ALL of us vote for him regardless of party or religion.</p>

		<p>There are enough Bush appointees on the courts to block any wholesale efforts to restructure business and labor practices based on race. Plus the open effort to throw whites out of jobs will trigger a backlash that should shake many whites who voted for Obama out of their lotus like state. And is Holder going to try to place language challenged immigrants in jobs held by English fluent whites? In the middle of a recession, one of the dumber thinks the dynamic duo of Obama and Holder could do.</p>

		<p>So why is anyone surprised that these socialist stooges are intent on helping a bunch of ignorant blacks win the ghetto lottery with taxpayers&rsquo; dollars?  It&rsquo;s win-win for them:  they get to hire a bunch on unqualified, incompetent affirmative action lawyers to help a bunch of mental cripples get their revenge on yt in the form of discrimination lawsuits.  My guess is that before midterm, the syphilis will actually back up full force into obama&rsquo;s brain, instead of merely dribbling into it as it does now, and he&rsquo;ll do something spectacular to revive his presidency, like declare war on Russia or Britain.</p>

		<p>Obama WON the presidential race&hellip; BY DEFAULT! He won leadership of the Democratic Party by virtue of having unlimited campaign funds to draw on (that &#8220;mysterious&#8221; backer of his). He won the election only because McFumble was perceived as being nothing but a continuation of G.W.B.&rsquo;s failed policies.</p>
<p>All the hype, hooplah, and plain bull droppings will not change the truth in what I&rsquo;ve said. Surely, the liberal fools will argue the opposite, but we all know what motivated people to vote as they did.</p>

		<p>Putting Obama in the White House did absolutely the opposite of transcending race. It made at least 4 years of American society about nothing BUT race. The divide will get deeper and uglier, with nasty consequences way beyond the inevitable racial vendetta.

<p>Notice how condescending he is to white people. It is a wonder how white people have created (almost without exception) the most advanced societies on earth.</p>

<p>Shawn,<br>
While I agree with you, there may be some good in his election as incredible as that sounds. I&rsquo;ve been hearing more and more comments from people about how Black behavior has become even more atrocious, (if that&rsquo;s conceivable) since the election. Maybe Whites are finally coming out of their slumber. It seems almost inevitable that there will be some kind of confrontation and that sadly, is maybe the only way to a resolution of the problem.   As it is now we get up every day and go about our business but we know that nothing is as it used to be and that we are always in danger. The Boers in SA have suffered some 3000 casualties over the last ten years and given the size of the US, I feel confident, without even having researched the stats, that our body count matches if not exceeds that.</p>
