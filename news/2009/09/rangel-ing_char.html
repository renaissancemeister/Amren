<h1>Rangel-ing: Charlie Pays &#8216;Angels&rsquo; in Ethics Probe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WCBS-TV (New York), September 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congressman [Charles] Rangel has been arrogant in refusing to discuss how, as the man who writes this country&rsquo;s tax laws, he failed to report over $1 million in outside income and $3 million in business transactions as required by the House, lapses under investigation by the House Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I recognize that all of you have an obligation to ask questions knowing that there&rsquo;s none of you smart enough to frame it in such a way that I&rsquo;m going to respond,&#8221; Rangel said.</p>
<p>There may be a reason for Rangel&rsquo;s arrogance. CBS 2 HD has discovered that since ethics probes began last year the 79-year-old congressman has given campaign donations to 119 members of Congress, including three of the five Democrats on the House Ethics Committee who are charged with investigating him.</p>
<p>Charlie&rsquo;s &#8220;angels&#8221; on the committee include Congressmen Ben Chandler of Kentucky, G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina and Peter Welch of Vermont. All have received donations from Rangel.</p>
<p>Only Welch sees something wrong with being financial beholden to Charlie.</p>
<p>&#8220;In an abundance of caution, he has returned all campaign contributions from Mr. Rangel,&#8221; said spokesman Bob Rogan, Welch&rsquo;s Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>It amounted to nearly 20 grand.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rangel&rsquo;s office did not return a request for comment on the question of whether the congressman thought members receiving donations from him should step aside and let others rule on the ethics charges.<br>

		<p>This hypocrite has favored tax increases continually and bitterly denounced tax reductions, as in his famous quote: &#8216;It&rsquo;s not s*** or n***** anymore, they just say let&rsquo;s cut taxes.&rsquo;  It seems Rangel  doesn&rsquo;t care to pay taxes of his own. </p>
<p>After all, Rangel is following the black credo that THEY should not have to pay taxes. </p>
<p>Larry Elder reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Sharpton said he saw no reason why blacks should pay taxes. &#8216;If we do not have a justice system that protects us, what are we paying for?&rsquo; Sharpton has faced multiple charges &mdash; and one conviction &mdash; of tax evasion&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And even though blacks are huge beneficiaries of taxation and (according to SBPDL):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A list of programs that have been created with the specific and stated purpose of helping black people would be long and would stretch into the quadrillion of dollars, a number so incomprehensible it barely deserves utterance and would defy belief if seen&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/lo55fl" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/lo55fl</a><br>
 <br>
they will come to his defense  &mdash;  it won&rsquo;t be long before the screams of racism start up, accusations of racial profiling, cries of &#8216;trying to bring down a black man&rsquo; and other shibboleths and slogans that substitute for deep thinking in the black community. </p>
<p>All else about rangel will be ignored by the msm because for them and for blacks, race trumps criminal activity.</p>

<p>Indeed, it should be illegal for a congressman to accept campaign donations from another congressman.  In fact, at minimum, it should be illegal for a congressman to accept donations from anyone who does not live in his district.</p>

We know, as realists and adults, that nothing is ever given for nothing.<br>
So I&rsquo;d like to know what was the <i>quid pro quo</i> in this case.</p>
