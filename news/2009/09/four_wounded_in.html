			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>City News Service, Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four people were hospitalized today for injuries they suffered when federal agents opened fire on three crowded vans to prevent them from jumping the U.S.-Mexico border at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, authorities said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Three agents  &mdash;  two with Customs and Border Protection and one with Immigration and Customs Enforcement  &mdash;  fired at one of the van drivers as he drove toward them at the inspection station in southern San Diego about 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to a San Diego police statement.</p>
<p>The van then crashed into a truck, police said.</p>
<p>The driver of the van, a 31-year-old man, and a passenger, a 42-year-old man, suffered gunshot wounds while a 37-year-old man who had been a passenger in the vehicle suffered cuts and a head injury, police said. A 30-year-old man who was a passenger in the truck was taken to a hospital complaining of pain.</p>
<p>Two of the van drivers were arrested, but the third fled back into Mexico, according to the police statement, which said that 74 undocumented immigrants were detained by federal agents.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred when the three vans entered the same line at the border crossing and went through together before their drivers tried to find open lanes leading to Interstate 5 or Interstate 805, police said.</p>
<p>The vans ended up stuck in traffic, and the drivers of two of them backed up to find escape, police said. They then went at high speed east to west through a post-primary inspection area, where the three federal agents opened fire on one of the vans&rsquo; drivers, police said.</p>

								<h2>U.S. Closes Mexico Crossing After Shooting</h2>
						<p>U.S. authorities closed the world&rsquo;s busiest land border crossing for several hours on Tuesday after suspected Mexican human traffickers tried to enter with illegal immigrants, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>U.S. agents fired at three vans packed with about 70 illegal immigrants that tried to evade heavy security and cross into the United States, the officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The port is closed and will remain closed for several hours,&#8221; U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokeswoman Angelica De Cima said after the incident at the congested San Ysidro crossing between the Mexican city of Tijuana and San Diego.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mack said the border crossing partially reopened on Tuesday evening. A Mexican border hotline for motorists said seven lanes at the crossing were open.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s violent drug gangs are increasingly moving into the lucrative people-smuggling business, but tight U.S. border security is forcing them to take bigger risks to get narcotics and illegal immigrants into the United States.</p>
<p>The brazen attempt was unprecedented at the heavily guarded crossing where helicopters circle overhead and armed agents with dogs keep watch at a series of staggered checkpoints.</p>
<p>All the illegal immigrants were arrested and taken into custody. The crossing, a major smuggling corridor for narcotics and illegal immigrants, was shut while police conducted the investigation.</p>
<p>Some 90 million people a year use the California-Mexico land border crossings, with almost half the traffic going through San Ysidro.</p>
<p>Angry drivers blared car horns as a huge traffic jam built up on the Mexican side while U.S. agents signaled them to turn around.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve never known the entire crossing to be closed before. We just didn&rsquo;t believe the agents when they told us to turn around,&#8221; said a Mexican student who gave his name as Juan Carlos and who crosses the border almost daily.</p>

		<p>Three cheers for the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol!!!</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s just wait for the inevitable lawsuits from the Mexicans who were shot or otherwise injured.  Something like the &#8220;ghetto lottery&#8221; for Hispanics will probably come from this.</p>

		<p>Wait until Janet hears about this &#8216;insensitive&rsquo; action on the part of border guards.  Rubber bullets for you guys, if your lucky, and blanks if she is really irritated at this unfriendly attitude toward our friends of the South.  Janet knows these matters can be settled diplomatically if we just treat these folks as good friends. When Janet was our governor here in Arizona she made a big show of sending National Guard troops to the border where they were occupied changing oil, patching tires and ordered to have no contact with migrants.</p>
<p>No one should hold their breath waiting for the Southern Border to be controlled while this administration is in office.  Just pray they don&rsquo;t move the border, in consultation with Mexico, of course. </p>

		<p>Look for Obama to weaken the Border Patrol and pressure the higher command to go easier on enforcement, because he wants to see more browns in the country to help reduce white voting power.  He will fight tooth and nail to get amnesty passed for the same reason.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I&rsquo;ve noticed from listening to the rhetoric of many blacks associated with and/or appointed by Obama that they are still using the same tired psychological tricks and propaganda to try to increase the size of their anti-white base.</p>
<p>They put themselves under the same umbrella as all &#8220;people of color,&#8221; thinking that they&rsquo;re tricking the other non-whites into believing that they are for them too, not just blacks.  This, in effect, is a childish, naive attempt to act as a force multiplier, since blacks are only 12% of the population and do not have the numbers to be as effective as they would like.</p>
<p>The Hispanic leadership, for the most part, thinks along the same lines, and attempts to effectively use the same kind of psychology.</p>
<p>The only problem with that tactic is neither group can get very many of their rank and file to go along with them, because, for the most part, the vast majority of them intensely dislike one another.  Undeterred, the leadership continues to sound off on the same propaganda, as if they are all just one big happy family who suffers ungodly humiliations at the hands of whitey.</p>
<p>The hatred against the white power base is so great, Obama or his minions don&rsquo;t care that browns are literally yanking homes and jobs out from under blacks throughout the country.  They see much benefit to their attempts to appear united in a kind of black/brown brotherhood.</p>
<p>So the black militants regard every illegal alien that comes into the country as one more entity that will help them take over and dominate the nation.</p>
<p>If this sounds humorous to you, knowing how all black dominated societies erupt into explosive failures, believe me they don&rsquo;t look at themselves that way.  So detached from reality, because they&rsquo;re blinded by their natural black arrogance and their lack of intellect to truly understand anything as it really is, they see themselves as stepping into positions as scientists, corporate heads, brilliant journalists, and all-knowing politicians.  With whitey out of the way, I have no doubt whatsoever they see the country running along better than it ever has.  All any country needs is the brothers in power.</p>
<p>As the brilliant Yale law school graduate, Van Jones, shouted to his audience, &#8220;We gonna change the system!  We gonna change the system!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Reference #2-Yes Janet seems to be a cursed name in federal law enforcement. It seems like only yesterday that Janet &#8220;Butch&#8221; Reno wanted to totally disarm the Border Patrol, and her subordinates at DOJ had to explain to her that the border is a dangerous place to work.</p>

		<p>This is similar to an incident that happened in Texas several years ago.  A deputy stopped a van for a traffic infraction and it suddenly took off narrowly missing him.  He shot at the tires and a fragment hit an &#8220;undocumented&#8221; family values favorite but caused no serious injury.</p>
<p>Soon afterward Bush lackey Johnny the &#8220;corrupt&#8221; Sutton charged and convicted the deputy for some trumped up something or other, probably &#8220;denial of civil rights&#8221; Bravo Sierra.  The county cop subsequently spent about a year in prison.</p>
<p>From news reports this latest border incident appears to be a &#8220;good&#8221; shoot. But don&rsquo;t be surprised if the agents are prosecuted. </p>
<p>This is a rare case where CBP Inspectors seem to have had a need to fire weapons.  Due to poor recruiting and &#8220;shake and bake&#8221; training that customs officers receive, they should not be trusted with firearms.  The overriding concerns of customs training are &#8220;crank out the numbers&#8221; and &#8220;check in your brain, you won&rsquo;t need it&#8221;. </p>
<p>A most scary proposition is going through customs at a major airport surrounded by half-witted badly trained customs agents. Customs officers are really rubber stamp bureaucrat paper shufflers, probably on the level of TSA goons. </p>
<p>The border patrol is unfortunately a part of CBP also.  The training for these agents is markedly better and they are real law enforcement officers who most definitely need to be armed.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless border patrol training has recently degenerated due to meddling by politically appointed hacks at the top of the BP chain of command. And, the BP senior command is culpable also to a degree in the continuing downward spiral of the once stellar BP organisation.  </p>
<p>BP senior &#8220;leaders&#8221; have adopted the creed, &#8220;I will go anywhere, anyplace, anytime, kiss any butt, and do anything for a promotion.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Excellent news, as this story sends a useful message to illegals: if border officers feel endangered, they WILL shoot.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to get encouraged by this sort of thing, but unless the Border Patrol gets political backup, this type of incident will be used against it. One can already see the leftist propaganda and legal actions being prepared against the Border Patrol. The real problem is still internal insofar as the US establishment has no commitment to defend the border. So the guys manning the frontiers are left at the end of the line.</p>
