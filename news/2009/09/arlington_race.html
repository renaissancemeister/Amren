			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sherri Ly, MyFoxDC, Sept. 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s a new turn in the debate over high occupancy toll lanes or HOT lanes.</p>
<p>A lawsuit filed by Arlington County last month claims the lanes benefit wealthy white people and discriminates against minorities. While the only rule to get in the HOV lanes on Interstate 395 is you must have three people in the car, Arlington claims adding HOT lanes would cut out poor and minorities by defacto. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Buried in the lawsuit filed last month, county attorneys argued the HOT lanes, &#8220;encourage and enable a financially-able, privileged class of suburban and rural, primarily Caucasian residents from Stafford and Spotsylvania counties operating single occupancy vehicles (&#8220;SOV&#8221;) unimpeded access on toll lanes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, it benefits wealthy white people. </p>
<p>A few pages later, the suit claims the Federal Highway Administration and the Virginia Department of Transportation failed to do the proper environmental analysis and that &#8220;their actions also constituted civil rights violations as they discriminated against minority and low income communities.&#8221; </p>
<p>Arlington County Chair Barbara Favola says the race issue only arose because the environmental review includes socioeconomic impact.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The discrimination claim may be shaky ground for Arlington. The latest U.S. Census numbers show Arlington&rsquo;s population is 80 percent white as of 2008 with a median household income in 2007 of $92,345. The percentage of whites was higher than Fairfax, Prince William, Stafford or Spotsylvania Counties, which are along the HOT lane corridor. Arlington was also wealthier than all but Fairfax County, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>
<p>Supporters of HOT lanes say people focus too much on the tolls and forget the project also includes money to study bus rapid transit (BRT) and additional park and ride lots.<br>
&#8220;Clearly minority and low income people could benefit because it provides an opportunity for car pooling and mass transit,&#8221; Herrity said. </p>

		<p>Wealthy white people are the ones paying the taxes for these roads to be built in the first place&hellip;but god forbid if they want to actually drive on them in such a manner that inconveniences a person of &#8220;color.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is the old &#8220;Lexus Lanes&#8221; argument combined with race.  The truth of the matter is that it&rsquo;s not just the rich and upper middle class that use toll lanes, it is anyone who might want to get home in a reasonable time span.</p>
<p>The reason we have to have HOV and HOT lanes is because of the environment.  All it does, though, is cram single-occupant vehicles into fewer lanes, thereby increasing their pollution.  Luckily, Missouri nor southern Illinois have them, because MO never allowed enforcement of HOV rules, and southern Illinois traffic, even in the Metro East suburbs of St. Louis, isn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>
<p>All this is is Arlington yuppie NIBMYs latching onto an excuse.  I don&rsquo;t have enough experience with DC Freeways to know, but I would bet that the state already owns enough right-of-way such that the new HOT lanes will be paving over a grass median.</p>

Blacks hate rules. They do everything in their power to argue against and undermine rules and standards. What we&rsquo;re left with is a society that hobbles along without order.</p>

		<p>Um, so the people PAYING for the HOV lanes (wealthy whites) aren&rsquo;t supposed to be able to use them?  Huh?  This is madness.</p>

		<p>May I suggest a 3/5 compromise.  Each white person in the HOV lane counts as 3/5 of a person, so a vehicle would need 5 white people to ride the HOV lane.  History has now come full circle.</p>

		<p>they don&rsquo;t call it the Peoples Republic of Arlington for nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Census numbers show Arlington&rsquo;s population is 80 percent white&#8221;<br>
yeah, but what are the demographics in the county&rsquo;s workforce?<br>
It is heavily skewed the other way.</p>

		<p>it seems that whenever i see a car occupied by people of color, there are always 4-8 people, plenty to take advantage of the carpool/hot lane. of course the ones I do see are never going anywhere, just parked at the 7-11 or lurking around some jr. high</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s clear to me that both whites AND blacks want segregation brought back - black lanes and white lanes. The black lanes will be pay YOU to use them, will provide automobiles AND drivers for them, and the lanes will be twice as big and twice as many of them as delegated to whites.</p>
