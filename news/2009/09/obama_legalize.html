			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, Sept. 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama said this week that his health care plan won&rsquo;t cover illegal immigrants, but argued that&rsquo;s all the more reason to legalize them and ensure they eventually do get coverage. </p>
<p>He also staked out a position that anyone in the country legally should be covered  &mdash;  a major break with the 1996 welfare reform bill, which limited most federal public assistance programs only to citizens and longtime immigrants. </p>
<p>&#8220;Even though I do not believe we can extend coverage to those who are here illegally, I also don&rsquo;t simply believe we can simply ignore the fact that our immigration system is broken,&#8221; Mr. Obama said Wednesday evening in a speech to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. &#8220;That&rsquo;s why I strongly support making sure folks who are here legally have access to affordable, quality health insurance under this plan, just like everybody else. </p>
<p>Mr. Obama added, &#8220;If anything, this debate underscores the necessity of passing comprehensive immigration reform and resolving the issue of 12 million undocumented people living and working in this country once and for all.&#8221; </p>
<p>Republicans said that amounts to an amnesty, calling it a backdoor effort to make sure current illegal immigrants get health care. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is ironic that the president told the American people that illegal immigrants should not be covered by the health care bill, but now just days later he&rsquo;s talking about letting them in the back door,&#8221; said Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But immigrant rights groups see the speech as a signal that Mr. Obama is committed to providing health care coverage for anyone in the United States legally, regardless of their citizenship status. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve certainly heard, publicly, him talking more about legal immigrants,&#8221; said Eric Rodriguez, vice president for research and advocacy at the National Council of La Raza (NCLR). &#8220;I think that was certainly positive progress. We were absolutely concerned about not hearing that.&#8221; </p>
<p>On Wednesday, hours before Mr. Obama&rsquo;s speech, the NCLR had given the administration a public scolding, demanding that Mr. Obama needed to make &#8220;a public commitment &hellip; to ensure that those who are here legally are covered.&#8221; </p>

		<p>This is exactly as I wrote in yesterday&rsquo;s post.  (Although I claim no special insight for stating the obvious.)  The next amnesty bill will be tough to beat now that the idiot American sheep have given the Democrats an absolute majority in both houses.  It was the Republicans who kept the last amnesty from passing, despite the pro-amnesty RINOs like McCain and Spector (who has finally admitted that he is a Democrat).<br>

		<p>Even if amnesty doesn&rsquo;t happen, illegal aliens will still get ObamaCare, because they can get Fake IDs and pretend like they&rsquo;re legal, or Obama-appointed judges will strike down prohibitions against illegal aliens getting ObamaCare (which President Obama probably knows in advance), or that Federal bureaucrats who administer ObamaCare in illegal alien heavy states tend to be Hispanic, and will let illegal alien Hispanics sign up for ObamaCare.  They would have no consequences in doing so (the bureaucrats), because it would be up to Obama&rsquo;s Attorney General and Obama&rsquo;s U.S. Attorneys to prosecute said bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Three million illegal aliens voted in the 2000 Presidential elections.  They were able to vote because the canvassing boards in the places where they live are run by Hispanics, white liberals, et al. that sign them up on the rolls and don&rsquo;t bother to check their immigration status.  Apply the same to health care.</p>

		<p>If the pro-black racist legalizes illegals, gets his healthcare diversity bill passed, and his cap and trade diversity bill passed, the white sleeping giant he awakened this year will turn into a tiger for certain.</p>
<p>This is no exaggeration.  The paradigm is shifting now, and the only thing that can stop it is if Obama makes a radical course change, and there&rsquo;s no way he will do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing all along that this country is headed for some serious fighting that will bring an end to this multicultural mess all on its own, and the beauty of it all is that we will have to do nothing to hurry things along.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s exactly what has happened these last 2 years.  We&rsquo;be been in a degenerative process that is causing the white couch potatoes to rise up and fight back.</p>
<p>Right now the tea partiers are concerned with political issues, but as this country continues down its path towards racial consciousness brought about by racist blacks and the messiah himself, whites will be FORCED to discuss matters in terms of racial loyalties.</p>
<p>In fact it&rsquo;s changing right this minute.  How?  Would it have ever been possible to hear Rush Limbaugh take a caller who complained that he&rsquo;s tired of being called a racist when Sotomyor made her racist statements and Obama obviously agreed with Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s statements, and Rush told the caller that he was absolutely right?</p>
<p>Also, before Obama, would we ever have heard Rush say that Obama is for HIS people only, obviously pointing out that the man is a black racist.  Or, how about Glenn Beck?  He came right out and said Obama is a racist, and was backed up by a forensic psychiatrist.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more, but these are a few examples indicating that whites are slowly creating a racial push, which are forcing racial thoughts and opinions to the surface. All this would have been taboo as recently as two years ago.</p>
<p>We have been living pretty much on the brink for years now.  It seems that everything is converging at one time to push us over the edge&hellip;&hellip;the economic fiasco, still ongoing and set to plummet even further; tribal fighting, mostly in California, and threats from several states to secede, plus overshadowing it all is the ineptness of the messiah&rsquo;s administration which is creating an opposition army all on its own, because of its racist policies and rhetoric.  </p>

		<p>Now he&rsquo;s cornered.  As another poster has said, a half truth is a full lie, and BHO has proved his accuser right.  &#8220;You Lie!&#8221; is a great slogan.  Jimmy Carter says we who oppose Obama are racist, Nancy Pelosi is fearful of angry rhetoric and says we should be held accountable for actions that our words may incite.  I fervently hope that I&rsquo;m not being too optimistic, but maybe things are heating up.  We may yet get that &#8220;honest discussion on race&#8221; that the Left will be unable to control.</p>

		<p>This health care reform is a smoke screen to fulfil Obama&rsquo;s promise of wealth transfer.  The middle class is hit again to support the have nots.  Actually, the illegals are already receiving all the health care they need all for free.  Legally and morally, hospitals and clinics cannot turn away people in need of medical care.  They just recover the costs by billing the people who already have insurance higher fees.  The idea of having everyone have insurance is again subsidized by taxpayers.  Money is a limited commodity, the easiest target/victim is the upper and middle class to squeeze money out of.  The lower classes have no money, the rich always find ways to avoid paying.  Unfortunately, due to loss or no immigration regulation, more and more have nots have to be supported.  This will only stop when protest reaches a critical mass.  I have yet to see any serious actions to rein in the rampant corruption and fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Now the government want to create another bigger expensive mess. The elected leaders reflect the level of a country and its peoples.       </p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful to finally hear a President say, &#8220;I intend to take care of Americans. Therefore, as of today, all those who dishonored our immigration laws and sneaked across our borders have 30 days to leave. If found after that, they will be put to work building a fence that will withstand anything, even the 50 foot ladders that Sen. Kennedy thought they would be dragging up from Guatamala. I will also stop all immigration until this country is back on an even keel. Then, the numbers coming in will be drastically reduced. They will be those who will add to our country&rsquo;s fabric, not those who intend to turn the US into a replica of whe third worlds they come from.&#8221; What a  wonderful dream!</p>

		<p>I really wish people would realize that the illegals &amp; minorities already have free medical care. Hospitals across this nation are in dire financial straits due to providing free health care to them. Just recently TMC here in KCMO was pointing to the millions of dollars they lost by having to treat these people. Ben Taub hospital in Houston, Tx. stated that 70 - 80% of the births at their facility were the product of parents being in America illegally. So by virtue of them stealing into my country and spitting out a kid or two they get for free the insurance that my wife and I have to pay almost $500.00 a month for. </p>

Yes, they most certainly are no longer couch potatoes, they are highly motivated, and they are getting ready.</p>

<p>Great idea! </p>
<p>And, how about this:  Let&rsquo;s declare everybody white, and then we can level legitimate criticism at them.</p>
<p>No more illegal whites!<br>
No more affirmative action for low scoring, sub-standard whites!<br>
Whites running in packs attacking other whites will automatically get life in prison.</p>

		<p>When a program does not cater to illegal aliens it&rsquo;s said to be &#8220;broken&#8221;.  Why is that?</p>
<p>Illegals break our immigration laws, so immigration is said to be &#8220;broken&#8221;.</p>
<p>Illegals want health care benefits, so health care is said to be &#8220;broken&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yes, It&rsquo;s broken.  It&rsquo;s broken by illegals and those that support the breaking of laws.</p>
<p>America today has outlived it&rsquo;s original purpose.  It is no longer a country founded upon the principals of freedom, the US Constitution and righteousness.</p>

<p>You are so right.  And they are also well practiced at bilking insurance companies for personal injury claims and workplace injuries.  I have personal experience in witnessing the incredible extensiveness of this huge fraud industry.  There are actually &#8220;Coyotes&#8221; who recruit people from Mexico to come to the U.S. for the sole purpose of getting a job, getting injured and then going to certain clinics where they have their cases &#8220;managed&#8221; for that predetermined outcome.</p>
<p>I have wanted to completely change our system, but I don&rsquo;t think there is any way to fix it now in a way that won&rsquo;t give free care to any sort of living human body inside the U.S.  As I wrote on another post last week, if legal healthcare is not available, they will just continue to show up at the ER.  The only solution is to deny any of them entry and in that, we are a dismal failure.</p>

		<p>The very idea of legalizing, millions upon millions of border criminals, many,many, of whom have committed every conceivable kind of document fraud, such as I.D. theft, tax fraud, DMV fraud, and have been allowed to ravenously rape, almost all of Americans social services, is mindboggling.</p>
<p>Then to top it off they have marched by the millions in various large cities of the U.S. protesting the laws American citizens have established. While doing all of this, they have carried banners reading&#8221;go back to Europe gringo, kill gringo, the border crossed us, we didn&rsquo;t cross the border, as well as carrying huge Mexican flags, with a small American flags below them, and turned upside down. </p>
<p>Finally, when they do receive amnesty and citizenship, their relatives, millions upon millions more, will be fully eligible to chain migrate, and cross the border to live in the U.S. As usuall, most Americans are so in the dark about all of this, that it all just seems to be a fait accompli. When the impact of it becomes clear, it will be way to late to do a thing about it. Then, the same corrupt politicians who pushed this illegal immigration, if complained to, will say that these people are here legally.</p>

<p>You may be right about Obama&rsquo;s over-all intentions, but you are using fraudulent accusation here in attempting to illustrate your point.  I worked in health care delivery for nearly three decades and being a Medicare provider is a very strictly regulated contract, with serious prosecution and jail time for any fraud or misuse of the system.  That is why many doctors don&rsquo;t want Medicare patients; the system is strict and they don&rsquo;t pay as much for the same services.  Independent studies have shown that the overhead of Medicare is 3% compared to 20% to 35% for private insurances.  This part of your argument is completely bogus and that is the problem with the Right on this issue.  The truth is that if Medicare was made the universal model and paid for by money already being spent on other healthcare systems and programs that don&rsquo;t work, the nation would save money over the next decade.  If we leave things as they are, the insurance companies will charge even higher premiums.  If we accept a forced to pay system, with no accountability for insurance companies, they will just raise premiums and have more million dollar salary CEOs.  It is amazing to me how much the Right hates the idea of giving a poor white some help, as if that would cause the entire nation to fail catastrophically,and at the same time allow arrogant capitalists to actually factually capsize the nation financially and now begin the same practices AND that is STILL not an issue to them.</p>
<p>But you are correct, the people do have the government that they deserve (Voltaire) and that includes the Right. </p>

		<p>This is not surprising as Obama is the &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; of the far-left groups who put him into power.  FYI, Hilary Clinton was not as far to the left as Obama and that is why they abandoned her in droves and threw open their checkbooks for Obama.  Their objectives of moving the United States far to the left has remained the same for decades.  </p>
<p>One goal of these left-wing groups, the massive third-world immigration to this nation to overwhelm the conservative, white population has been ongoing for as long.  So now they are going for the kill as they have the radical president of their dreams in power.  For moderates and conservatives, this will be the critical battle that cannot, under any circumstances be lost.  It does not matter how these &#8220;health&#8221; and amnesty bills are to be stopped, it only matters that they are stopped.  When someone is out to destroy you forget about being a &#8220;gentleman&#8221; and playing by the rules.  </p>

		<p>The problem with illegals, with all immigration really is because of the dire threat of baby boomer retirement. Health care is one way I think the politicians hope to plug the worker to retired gap they see beginning within the next year or so and growing to a huge problem within 10 years. I also think this is one reason we have caved to feminism so completely and countinuously transfer wealth at white and male expense. All to get more workers into the system to support the medicaid and retirement of the baby boomers.</p>
<p>The downside of feminism was abortion which further reduced the possible replacement of workers so we opened up the borders completely to try and plug this loss.</p>
<p>The politicians especially the liberal ones will continue to keep the borders open and bow to all immigrants hispanic, african, asian any and all of them to try and shore up this shortfall. </p>
<p>These are interesting times thats for sure.</p>

&#8220;McCain is in fact the reason that Obama was elected.</p>
<p>My dog could have run and presented a better result than McCain. In fact a dog could probably have won!&#8221;</p>
<p>MY REMARKS:<br>
This is the crux of the matter.<br>
It is amazing that Americans could not see this!<br>
McCain was set up to run in order to ensure that the Democrats and Obama win.</p>
<p>If the Republicans wanted to win the election, they would have fronted a winner as the candidate.</p>
<p>I think great forces behind the scenes are planning America&rsquo;s demise. Forces entrenched in the Democrats and Republicans&hellip;<br>
And white Americans became to fat, lazy and ignorant to even think. Much less will they organize and act!</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, you would have actively, through your pacifism, have contributed to the fall of white, Western, Christian civilization.</p>

<p>I was wondering myself how John McCain, whose campaign was &#8220;finished&#8221; in the fall of 2007, all of a sudden &#8220;came back&#8221; to win as many Republican votes as he did.  Am I to believe that the very same people he bashed and trashed for years would turn right around and give him more votes than Romney, Huckabee, Tancredo, Duncan Hunter and Ron Paul?  Voter fraud isn&rsquo;t only a Democrat thing&hellip;my suspicion is that the Stupid Party handed the nomination to McCain because they knew any Republican would lose, so as not to &#8220;sully&#8221; &#8220;winners&#8221; like Mitt Romney.</p>
<p>But I think Obama could have been beaten and quite easily.  It&rsquo;s only the Stupid Party that thinks in such pessimistic terms.</p>

		<p>Obama is a simply a puppet with strings being pulled by people much smarter than he is. He was selected because of many factors, including his speaking ability (when reading prepared text), his mixed race, and connections to both Islam and Christianity. Who didn&rsquo;t predict this move to &#8216;legalize&rsquo; a large voting block to ensure Democrats and their hidden worldwide controllers continue to be a token leader of this country?</p>

		<p>What is interesting is that a White crowd can be gathered for political reasons. That it is not openly racial is not the point; even if most would deny, even to themselves, that it was racial.</p>
<p>Once the infrastructure is in place, all that is needed is a mental leap, a mere shadow in the collective White mind to provide the simple motivation.</p>
<p>No Hannibal is needed to logistically move armies and elephants over the Alps. Just a shadow of thought that forms a consensus in the White mind and provides a group motivation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to guess what it would be. It would probably be like going down a road without overt racial consciousness; but then being put in a position where there&rsquo;s no turning back; you&rsquo;d have to go forward or die. You&rsquo;ve burned your bridges behind you.</p>

<p> I agree that&rsquo;s why I opposed them both. In any case, amnesty will legalize and encourage even more medical abuse. At least, most illegal&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t going to the emergency rooms for a sore throat, cold or erectile dysfunction  &mdash;  wait until Obamacare is passed! I also second what Bobby says: &#8220;finally, when they do receive amnesty and citizenship, their relatives, millions upon millions more, will be fully eligible to chain migrate, and cross the border to live in the U.S.&#8221;</p>

<p>Illegals want health care benefits, so health care is said to be &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yes, It&rsquo;s broken. It&rsquo;s broken by illegals and those that support the breaking of laws.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Actually, the illegals are already receiving all the health care they need all for free. Legally and morally, hospitals and clinics cannot turn away people in need of medical care. They just recover the costs by billing the people who already have insurance higher fees. The idea of having everyone have insurance is again subsidized by taxpayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely, totally right.  My hospital now charges those with insurance $18,000 to $20,000 for a normal childbirth with no complications.  Illegal aliens pay absolutely nothing for a childbirth at my hospital.  Medicare reimburses the hospital $1,600 for each illegal alien childbirth.</p>
<p>About 60 percent of the births at my hospital are illegal aliens on the $1,600 medicare.  It is easy for me and the other billing clerks to see if the Mother is legal or illegal.  If the Mother is legal, there will be a social security number.  If she is illegal, there will not be a social security number.</p>
<p>60 percent of the births have a Mother with a hispanic name and no social security number.</p>
<p>The reason White Americans with insurance pay $18,000 to $20,000 for a normal birth is to keep the hospital going, to make up for the enormous loses to illegal alien births.</p>
<p>The children born to illegal alien Mothers will grow up with full affirmative action privileges.  The White children whose parents paid $18,000 to $20,000 for their births will grow up to be unemployable because of affirmative action.</p>

		<p> Illegals do get free health care in America when they cannot afford to pay, and that this gift overburdens hospitals as well as welfare programs with the costs ultimately passed on to tax payers. </p>
<p>Just because illegals might not be formally part of the government run insurance program does not mean the practice of providing mandatory, unpaid care to them will cease. </p>
<p>It will not. Somebody has to pay. When the state and federal governments cannot assume the burden by adequately reimbursing hospitals and clinics, the care centers will close their doors as some have already done. </p>
<p>Take a good look at California&rsquo;s fiscal crisis, brought on in large part by its collapsed health care system. California&rsquo;s failures could represent the trajectory of the other 49 states if they too embrace a large illegal population and fail to enforce immigration laws. </p>
<p>When states ignore illegal immigration, the burden for social services shifts to the citizens. Gradually, the illegal aliens become quasi-legitimate. </p>
<p>Inevitably, the vicious cycle begins: more aliens come, more have no insurance and through ballooning taxes citizens bear the brunt of the costs. </p>
<p>This folly will not disappear on its own; it will only grow. </p>
<p>America cannot have open borders and a society that embraces aliens without destroying our social structure. </p>
<p>If Obama and Gutierrez don&rsquo;t exactly lie about illegal immigrants and health policy, then they don&rsquo;t tell the entire truth either.<br>

<p>In the end, it really isn&rsquo;t about legalizing the invaders or anything else in favor of non-whites per se. What this health care mess really is about is an attempt to set up a situation in which whites - who are not part of the elite group of Marxists in charge - can be <i>denied</i> health care or at least see it delayed long enough to cripple or kill or them.

<p>Here&rsquo;s a question you might be able to answer, if you haven&rsquo;t already.  President Obama claims that he can fund ObamaCare by cutting $500 billion worth of waste in Medicare over the next several years.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t politicians up in arms that there is a half trillion bucks of waste in Medicare?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think there is that much waste in Medicare.  The other possibility is that Obama defines &#8220;waste&#8221; as treating old white people thereby keeping some Republican voters alive such that Florida is still a swing state.</p>
