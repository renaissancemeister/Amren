			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Royson James, Toronto Star, September 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the 21st straight September morn, the first day of school finds me in the halls of Crawford Adventist Academy. This year, the fourth and last of Jameses enters high school to start the beginning of the end of the cycle.</p>
<p>But another school tugs at the heart this day.</p>
<p>Over at Keele and Sheppard, a bold experiment is beginning. Can a Toronto public school tasked to engage students through the use of an Africentric curriculum, focus and culture succeed in stemming outrageous dropout rates among black students?</p>
<p>Seated on the gym floor in their crisp uniform of white top, black bottoms and African print vest, the 115 student pioneers are part of an extraordinary enterprise. But despite the television cameras, African drums, speeches and other embellishments, the elementary students can&rsquo;t possibly grasp the importance of the enormous experiment they and their parents have embraced.</p>
<p>Wisely, the school board allows the media horde to record the event. And journalists get a glimpse of the ethos of the place, the spirit and verve that is to empower these students.</p>
<p>Trustee James Pasternak delivers a speech that likely sailed over the students&rsquo; heads. It&rsquo;s worth recording because, other than Angela Wilson and Donna Harrow, the two parents who spearheaded this latest attempt at a special school for the special needs of black students, Pasternak is most responsible for this moment of triumph.</p>
<p>Fellow trustees fought the idea, painted it in unpalatable terms so that the public would rail against it, and finally, voted against its introduction even though school board policy says such schools are essentially a right. But Pasternak and a razor-thin majority stood firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we mark not so much the opening of a new school but the affirmation of an ideal,&#8221; Pasternak says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our great responsibility as educators is to ensure that students who enter our system must leave with the knowledge that there are no closed doors, that there are no glass ceilings, and that they have the skills and character to set a course and define their own future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We reaffirm today the mission that the school board can be an engine of social change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stripped of all the hand-wringing over the Africentric school, this core remains: Forty per cent of Toronto&rsquo;s black kids are dropping out of school. That alone is enough for a national inquiry, extensive parental reforms and intervention, and a host of initiatives. It is a crisis unfolding before our eyes as dropouts gun down each other on our streets.</p>
<p>Consider this: That cute Africentric school boy yawning on the front page of the Star last Tuesday will be a much more difficult recruit for a future gang when he&rsquo;s knocking on the door of a corporate boardroom.</p>
<p>This group of students will graduate  &mdash;  empowered, confident, a class of world-beaters. Why? Because they will leave this school loving themselves, respecting their community, and utterly convinced they can take on the world on society&rsquo;s terms.</p>
<p>To see them last Tuesday is to believe this.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look so beautiful, you&rsquo;re gorgeous, you&rsquo;re precious, you&rsquo;re a gift to this country, this city and the world because you&rsquo;ll grow up to be leaders,&#8221; school official Lloyd McKell tells them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Toronto should anticipate at this school. It&rsquo;s what my Avi gets at Crawford. How exhilarating that it is available to students who&rsquo;re at such grave risk.</p>

		<p>Time will tell whether or not an &#8220;Afrocentric&#8221; education will do anything for these kids. My suspicion is that they are the cream of the crop of the black kids to begin with. I know that this is not much when you know that the average black IQ hovers around 85 to begin with but maybe these kids will do better and bring other black parents around to voluntary segregation. </p>

		<p>If an Afro-centric school can help Africans, then German-centric or British-centric schools could do the same for German- or British-American students.</p>
<p>Do you think that this reporter would say: &#8220;This group of German-American students will graduate &mdash; empowered, confident, a class of world-beaters. Why? Because they will leave this school loving themselves, respecting their community, and utterly convinced they can take on the world on society&rsquo;s terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look so beautiful, you&rsquo;re gorgeous, you&rsquo;re precious, you&rsquo;re a gift to this country, this city and the world because you&rsquo;ll grow up to be leaders,&rdquo; school official Lloyd McKell tells them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course the reporter would never say this about Whites.  This type of program or praise is not allowed if you do not have the correct skin color.<br>

		<p>It should be noted that Royson James, the author of this article, is a <i>black</i> writer for <i>Toronto Star</i> newspaper, so his bias may show support for this black ethnocentric school. </p>
<p>School official <i>Lloyd McKell&rsquo;s</i> had bold remarks where he says &ldquo;You look so beautiful, you&rsquo;re gorgeous, you&rsquo;re precious, <b>you&rsquo;re a gift to this country, this city</b> and the world because you&rsquo;ll grow up to be leaders.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Black kids have <b>not</b> been a &#8220;gift&#8221; to my country, nor to my city of Toronto, but quite the contrary. Every day of the week there are non-stop reports of black shootings, black robberies, and just black crime in general and they only represent 8% of Toronto&rsquo;s population. These people are the products of bad immigration policies that allowed tens of thousands of illiterate, single mothers from the Caribbean to work as baby-sitters, nannies and other low income occupations until they gained permanent residency. Once that was accomplished, they sent for their fatherless children to join them in Canada. Once safely ensconced into our generous welfare state, more black babies meant more welfare money. Some will be working on their 3rd generation in social assistance money. </p>
<p>For those black immigrants who are more successful than others, we offer fast-track employment opportunities at the expense of white Canadians. In addition, we&rsquo;ll promote black employees over more longer serving and more qualified white Canadians. </p>
<p>Racial politics worked well for a 43 yr. old Jamaican-born black man who was <a href="https://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2009/09/14/10884126-sun.html" rel="nofollow">promoted to Deputy Police Chief</a> over more qualified Canadian white cops this week.</p>
<p>This latest Deputy Chief appointment to Toronto&rsquo;s police service now translates into having 2 whites and 2 blacks who now hold these lofty police positions in Canada&rsquo;s largest city.  </p>

<p>Could as many Amren readers as possible please make a note for us to follow the progress of this institution for 1 year and then report back.  It will make interesting reading. I do not live in North America or Canada so I can&rsquo;t help with reports.</p>
<p>I will diarise to ask questions in September 2010.</p>

		<p>You are laughing at the &#8220;you are future leaders&#8221; remark, in fact, it may be true.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised if many of these &#8220;students` will be offered grants to study at Harvard and then indeed become leaders.</p>
<p>Their IQes don;t matter, a Harvard diploma matters and donèt forget, there are so many liberals in Canada and US.</p>

		<p>Blacks do not function well in an all-black environment. They can do their &#8216;best&rsquo; when they are the minority in an ideally majority-white population. As seen with public school integration in the States, as soon as blacks hit a certain percentage of the total population, say 40%, then the learning environment starts to go downhill real fast.</p>
<p>Well, since this is an entirely Afrocentric school, maybe this time ol&rsquo; Whitey can&rsquo;t be blamed for the usual abysmal test scores among black students. Maybe, I say.<br>

		<p>For the benefits of AmRen&rsquo;s non-Canadian readers;</p>
<p>First the Toronto Star is an EXTREME left-wing, ULTRA-LIBERAL newspaper. It has never, ever, met an ethnic story it didn&rsquo;t like. (I can&rsquo;t overstate this).<br>
 <br>
As far as blacks being a &#8220;gift&#8221; to Canada their arrival since the 1960&rsquo;s (thank you Trudeau) has been an absolute curse. They have created the same conditions blacks create everywhere; crime, poverty and violence. Canada never had any problems with European immigrants. Now the number 2 cop in Toronto is a Jamaican who has ridden the racial gravy train to his very well paid position. Blacks have been nothing but trouble since they first came here. We were a THOUSAND TIMES better off without them.</p>

		<p>We have to ask who decides which groups are to get their own schools and how the curricula is to be chosen. I&rsquo;m not an expert but this has to be a version of fascism. Whenever you have the government involved in group dynamics that is fascism.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but academics who celebrate their stupidity is all too common anymore.</p>
<p>The should make sure they have it all on video tape, so some enterprising person can show it in about twenty years when the graduates have threatened to change society to an African one under the threat of overwhelming the nation with crime, riots and war. </p>

		<p>To Matt #8;</p>
<p>     The only blacks who seem to do well in a white environment are those who at least have the IQ to function in said society. Dropping a group of people who are (at a minimum) 1 to 1.5 standard deviations below the average in intelligence is going to create a lot of havoc. Yes, there are some who function well, but they tend to be the exception. The (black) achievers tend to bring a lot of baggage with them in the form of dysfunctional relatives. Also, the tipping point for public schools tends to be closer to 10 - 15%, not 40. Trust me, when this school has a scandal and/or the test scores are lagging way behind, it will blamed on institutional racism. If this were Mississippi in the 1940&rsquo;s, you might have an argument, but not in Canada in 2009.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Consider this: That cute Africentric school boy yawning on the front page of the Star last Tuesday will be a much more difficult recruit for a future gang when he&rsquo;s knocking on the door of a corporate boardroom.&#8221; </p>
<p>      If this kid is knocking on the door of a corporate boardroom, more than likely he is there thanks to affirmative action (or whatever it is called in Canada). Maybe he&rsquo;ll grow up to be the go to guy for marketing Malt Liquor, spinner rims, or whatever passes for must have &#8220;bling&#8221; in 2030. Realistically, those who graduate and get into a University setting at some point in their lives will probably wind up working for the government in some capacity. Here in the US, 7 out of 10 black college graduates work for some local, state, or federal agency.  <br>

		<p>I would venture a bet that &#8216;victim studies&rsquo; are an important part of the curriculum required to get a diploma from the place. </p>
<p>I wonder how those Canadian liberals would handle it if some white kid applied to get in there, claiming to suffer from &#8220;racial identity disorder&#8221;. Why turn him down? As it is, one is allowed to use the restroom for the opposite (biological) gender in some places if one has a case of gender identity disorder.</p>

		<p>What is wonderful about an all black school, is that the authorities can manipulate the standards to reflect the result that they want to see. They can lower the standards and nobody would be the wiser. Hell they can even give them the papers before the exams. This is typically what I would expect of black teachers.</p>

<p>Then they can use the desired, manipulated results to make conclusions. One of these conclusions would be to say that as the pass rate in the black only is 100%, it proves that the high black failure/drop out rate elsewhere, is because of white racism.</p>
<p>Thus they will achieve their political agenda, which is to fan the flames of white guilt. </p>
