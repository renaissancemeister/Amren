<p>New surveys show steep declines in Obama&rsquo;s approval ratings among whites  &mdash;  including Democrats and independents  &mdash;  who were crucial elements of the diverse coalition that helped elect the country&rsquo;s first black president.</p>
<p>Among white Democrats, Obama&rsquo;s job approval rating has dropped 11 points since his 100-days mark in April, according to surveys by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. It has dropped by 9 points among white independents and whites over 50, and by 12 points among white women  &mdash;  all groups that will be targeted by both parties in next year&rsquo;s midterm elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Obama has a lock on African Americans, his support among white voters seems to be almost in a free fall,&#8221; said veteran Republican pollster Neil Newhouse.</p>
<p>Strategists in both parties blame Obama&rsquo;s decline on growing discontent with his policy agenda, particularly after a month of often-rowdy debate over his proposed healthcare overhaul, in which some conservatives accused him of socialism. Obama&rsquo;s ratings seem likely to rise again if he wins passage of healthcare legislation this fall.</p>
<p>But the drop in support among whites also comes as some conservatives have stoked controversies that have the potential to further erode Obama&rsquo;s standing among centrists  &mdash;  including some controversies that resulted from White House stumbles.</p>
<p>One such episode came to a head Sunday when Van Jones, Obama&rsquo;s green jobs czar, resigned after a week of criticism over past inflammatory statements and for signing onto conspiracy theories questioning whether the U.S. government played a role in the Sept. 11 attacks. {snip}</p>
<p>In another episode, some conservatives have criticized a White House dinner invitation issued to the lead lawyer in the American Civil Liberties Union lawsuits that have forced the government to disclose Bush-era interrogation techniques. The lawyer was invited to an event for the Muslim holiday of Ramadan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These controversies have followed conspiracy theories that the president was born overseas and is ineligible to hold office, and that his true religion is Islam  &mdash;  false rumors that some Democrats worry could be affecting the public&rsquo;s view of the president and his party.</p>
<p>Pew first identified a slippage in white support immediately after a news conference in July, when Obama surprised many by saying that a white police officer had acted &#8220;stupidly&#8221; in arresting a black Harvard professor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One black congressman, Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), was quoted last week alleging that opposition to Obama&rsquo;s healthcare policies was &#8220;a bias, a prejudice, an emotional feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some Americans have not gotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering, &#8216;How did this happen?&rsquo;&#8221; Rangel said, according to the New York Post.</p>
<p>Democratic pollster David Beattie conducted a survey last month in one competitive congressional district that found that more than a quarter of independents believed Obama had not proven his natural-born status. The same sentiment was expressed by nearly 6 in 10 Republican women  &mdash;  a group that Beattie said would be important for a Democratic victory.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The analysis, with a headline asking if 2010 could be the &#8220;year of the angry white senior,&#8221; warns that Obama faces a growing &#8220;gulf&#8221; between his still-strong support among young people and his dwindling numbers among people 65 and older.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than half of whites older than 50 approved of Obama&rsquo;s job performance in April. But now, after weeks of Republican accusations that the Democrats would seek to cut Medicare benefits, that number is 43%. Among white Democrats, Obama&rsquo;s approval rating dropped to 78%, from 89%.</p>

		<p>President Obama&rsquo;s support among white voters has always been tenuous.  Politics are games of margins, and while there will always be a certain percentage of whites that (1) will support Democrats no matter what, and/or (2) want to support a black out of racial guilt (there is a lot of overlap between 1 and 2), Barack Obama won the presidency mainly because of white anxiety about the economy, especially in states like Ohio.</p>
<p>The economy, more than health care or anything, will be Obama&rsquo;s Waterloo.</p>

		<p>The media euphoria of Obama&rsquo;s election was very misleading. They tried to create the illusion that white independents and democrats voted for him because they wanted the first black president and to make an historic (anti-white) statement on race. </p>
<p>Obama is only &#8216;historic&rsquo; because he was lucky enough to run against one of the most uninspiring Republican candidates ever put up on the heels of perhaps the most distastrous Republican administrations in history. The Democrats could have put up a cardboard cutout of some generic suite and tie and the cutout still would have won.</p>
<p>Obama will always have his faithful foaming at the mouth leftists just as Hitler had his faithful in the bunker with him at the end. The others fell for the &#8216;post-racial&rsquo; nonsense that we on Amren all know was a lie. Hopefully, these people have learned their lesson not to cast a vote for somebody &#8216;in spite of being black&rsquo; and instead vote against somebody precisely for being black. You won&rsquo;t get a white politician with black skin (&#8216;post-racial&rsquo;). Black skin means a black politician.</p>

		<p>Perhaps this is a turning point if white women are finally turning away from the feminist political leaders who only support white male bashing and pro-minority legislation there is hope for America.</p>
<p>Until that happens politicians like Obama will continue to get the feminist 43% of the white vote.</p>

Obama is not a normal American. Thus whites will finally vote their interests and not some emotional feel good obligation. Obama is wrecking the economy and the US dollar is in free fall with China and other nations about to ditch it. When that happens, those with savings will ditch the Democrats. That would be whites, as blacks spend every nickel they make  on cars, houses and clothes that are way too expensive for their incomes. Obama is half white. Too bad he chose to be black. He is going down, and voters, i.e. most of whom are still white are not going into bankruptcy so that they can pat themselves on the back for support of a &#8216;black&rsquo; President. The bottom line wins out every time.</p>

		<p>Obama got to where he is by hiding who he REALLY is. But he committed a grievious error by commenting on the &#8220;Gates&#8221; arrest and exposing his true nature. A lot of white people voted for him in the misplaced hope that putting a black man in the presidency would show that we are not a racist country and could once and for all end this obsession with race.  Now, with his own words &amp; associates, white people have seen that Obama is not who they thought he was, and worse, that he is a very angry man with a chip on his shoulder. I just hope that more Americans wake up and are ready to do something drastic to remove him from office. Enough already!</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s plummeting approval rating among whites was rather predictable.  A majority of whites voted against Obama in 2008.  Many of the whites that did vote for him did so for the following reason(s):</p>
<p>1)  They viewed George W. Bush&rsquo;s presidency as a disaster (and who can argue with that).<br>
2)  They have led relatively insulated lives, not having experienced multiculturalism up close and personal.  This is particularly true of whites in their 20s who have never really had to roll up their sleeves and work in a diverse blue-collar environment.</p>
<p>As the economy continues to slide into the abyss, Obama&rsquo;s poll numbers among whites will follow a parallel course, and will probably end up below 20%.  Makes you almost feel sorry for the poor guy. </p>

		<p>After 7 months or so, Americans are waking up to the fact  that Obama&rsquo;s policies are a little more radical than advertised.   In other words, the voters may well believe they  were sold a bill  of  goods.   His picks of Van Jones and some other Czars also sounded alarm bells,  especially those watching the Glenn Beck show.  The bottom line is that he never had the Repubs and has now lost the Independents and some Blue Dogs.  He will obviously attempt a &#8220;Hail Mary&#8221; tomorrow night and chances are that will probably be batted down which is no doubt a good thing.</p>

 <br>
&#8220;False rumors?&#8221;  Then show us proof to the contrary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pew first identified a slippage in white support immediately after a news conference in July, when Obama surprised many by saying that a white police officer had acted &#8220;stupidly&#8221; in arresting a black Harvard professor.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
It is apparent that Obama IS a racist, as many have said, beginning with their comments after the Jeremiah Wright incident,  then the Gates affair, plus many other smaller things.  He opened a curtain behind which we saw who the racist really was.  Gates is even a worst racist.  He&rsquo;s an AA professor that couldn&rsquo;t pass a high school test on nearly any subject yet he is working for Harvard.  He hates whites even though it is through their grace he is at Harvard and not working the only job he is really qualified for, which is janitor.<br>
 <br>
[&#8220;Once he gets the credit for passing healthcare reform, then he&rsquo;ll see the political benefit,&#8221; Parker said.]   <br>
 <br>
The majority of the country DO NOT want Obama&rsquo;s brand of pro-black&hellip;&hellip;and only pro-black&hellip;&hellip; legislation.  What part of that does this guy not understand?  And he THINKS its passage will win him points?<br>
 <br>
There&rsquo;s two worlds.  The world of Washington and the media fringe types, which is as bazaar as anything I can think of, and the real world.  The real world is as alien to this bunch as the bush country in Africa.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s not talked about here is that Obama lost the white vote by a thumping 45-55 margin.  He was imposed on an unwilling white majority by massive race-based bloc voting from non-whites.  We have lost control of our destiny.  This has been carefully ignored by the media for fear of alerting us into regaining it while there is still time.</p>
<p>Still, whites, being a fair-minded and generous bunch, gave Obama majority approval ratings.  Most presidents outpoll their election percentage early in their term as they get a fair chance from a large portion of those who did not vote for them.</p>
<p>In any event, Obama&rsquo;s white support settling back down to its normal levels of solid disapproval is inevitable, no reason for shock.</p>

		<p>Hmm, let me get this straight: kids who attend interracial schools do not lose their biases, indeed, they have them strengthened? Hmmm, how could THIS be?? This, despite all the &#8220;scholars&#8221; in the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s who assured us that integration would solve everything? And now these modern-day &#8220;scholars&#8221; tell us not to listen to those old scholars, parents have to begin a program of indoctrination at an early age! But why should we believe these new &#8220;scholars&#8221; when the old ones were so obviously wrong? And why are racial biases so potent and widespread to begin with? Could they just possibly be part of a survival mechanism? But the kicker is the claim that &#8220;It&rsquo;s horrifying to imagine kids being &ldquo;proud to be white.&rdquo; So why is it not horrifying to imagine kids being &ldquo;proud to be black? As far as  the claim that whites don&rsquo;t need this message because they already belong to the &#8220;race that has more power, wealth, and control in society&#8221; the simple answer is that this can change, and if whites have no racial consciousness, they will eventually be kicked out of their own neighborhoods over the short term and kicked out of their own countries over the long term.</p>

<p>Well, this may be the proverbial eleventh hour for the white majority in this country, but then again it may not be? It could be that multiculturalism and the vilely evil traitors (really, while &ldquo;vilely evil traitors&rdquo; suffices here, there are no words in any language to accurately describe the true debased nature of these Red imbeciles) who rapturously celebrate it, have seen their godless utopia exposed for what it is far too soon?</p>
<p>Or put another way, whites are not yet a minority and still make up about 65% of the country. We still hold most of the cards and if we are finally waking up to the despondently apocalyptic future we will likely face in the very near future, as a despised minority in our own country, perhaps things will cease to be going &ldquo;inevitably&rdquo; over the rainbow. </p>
<p>General Secretary Obama and his policies are plummeting in the polls of the white demographic for one reason only, because he and his goals are distinctly anti-white. His proposed healthcare plan for example, is nothing more than a redistribution of whitey&rsquo;s money and very existence for the accelerated metastasizing of those of colorful &ldquo;enrichment&rdquo; and entitlement in this country. That is simply the hard facts of life here, and any who would say otherwise (like this Marxstream &ldquo;journalist&rdquo; Peter Wallsten) are either delusional, or beneath the conceptual abilities of a lobotomized cockroach. </p>

		<p>Having lived in multiple countries, one thing that I always understood is that the people make the country, not the government. When I lived in Germany, I had respect for the German people and their culture; it was their country. When I lived in Korea, I understood that the country belonged to the Koreans and as a guest, I showed respect to them. One thing that liberals can&rsquo;t seem to grasp is that America belongs to the White Anglo Saxons. America is not anybody&rsquo;s country; it belongs to the people that created it, the people that toiled and gave their blood, sweat and tears for it.</p>
<p>So where did Obama go wrong? He didn&rsquo;t respect the White Anglo Saxon core that is America. And now all the libs and Dems are scratching their heads in bewilderment. They just can&rsquo;t seem to fathom that America is still majority White, not the multicultural stew they envision.<br>

		<p>At some point we will have to stop using code Phrases like &#8220;take our country back&#8221; and face the real truth. Blacks are a separate, dangerous, unassailable minority with our borders and need to be expelled or isolated within designated areas. Whites once isolated Indians because they preyed on settlers and killed people in isolation. Can the numbers of this predation be any less than the huge numbers of dead and raped that are being rung up now? The beaten and tortured and knifed and shot and robbed and torn whites must make an impression on someone. How can we live like a herd under assault in our own homeland? The Japanese would never tolerate it, the Chinese would never tolerate it. Only Western man seems to find this tolerable. It is evil and must be faced.</p>

		<p>pardon my lack of cap&rsquo;s and certain punctuation. my keyboard doesn&rsquo;t work properly.</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t really add much to what has already been said but let me say that events of late i.e. the gate&rsquo;s controversy, attempting to push an unwanted expensive govt. health care program down our throats and his latest appointments of mark lloyd and the now former green jobs czar, the avowed communist van jones. how many anti-american anarchists, marxists, felons and outright communists does he have to be tied to for white americans - even democrats - to wake up. i knew this guy spelled trouble a long time before he was elected. when i heard him speak i got a chilly feeling i don&rsquo;t get often&hellip;and i don&rsquo;t mean a chris mathews-type &#8221;thrill&#8221; up my leg. going by his past associations from bill ayers, to father pfleger, to jeremiah wright, to tony rezko, to his communist childhood mentor frank davis, it was obvious to me this guy spelled trouble. yet for many of the reasons given above - including white guilt and the need for many whites to &#8221;cleanse&#8221; themselves - whites flocked to the polls to put this guy in office. on election night i witnessed incredulously white faces with tears of joy who openly wept. <br>
unfortunately i think his outrageous behavior is only going to get worse. he knows now he won&rsquo;t get re-elected&hellip;that is unless he grants amnesty to millions of illegal aliens who will show their gratitude and vote for him in 2012. there may very well be enough of those newly minted voters to put him over the line&hellip;in spite of the will of the majority of the majority. we are beginning to see the takeover of our majority-white country by minorities. it&rsquo;s happening faster than i thought it would. good bye america. there&rsquo;ll never be another one like you.</p>

		<p>Obama rolled in on Bush hatred.  It almost seems like a plan by some unknown force with an unknown agenda.  The Republicans helped out by putting in McCain against this likable and articulate individual that seemed to come out of nowhere.  They supported a very liberal (amnesty) Republican president in getting us mixed up in an unwinnable war.  I still have yet to understand why we are in Iraq.  Saddam was a natural buffer against Iran.  Why did we have to destablize Iraq?  Personally, I think the Republicans intentionlly helped to lead us down our current path.  Every action our goverment has taken thus far has resulted in a very predictable outcome.  These are not random events.</p>
<p>With all due respect for McCain, he seemed to want to lose.  Why else would he have picked Palin (&#8216;you betcha&rsquo;)as a running mate?  The Democrats could have ran a dirty sock and it would have won the presidency given the circumstances.  This was a carefully orchestrated plan.  How else could this little known candidate quickly make the spotlight (even his citizenship is questioned) and win the election?  The road to this was paved by both parties along with an agreeable mass media and I believe it is all toward some unknown end.</p>
<p>All said, I think we need to be very wary of our leadership and very agressive in getting our country back.  We are rapidly taking leave of what made us such a great power.  I do hope I am wrong but when I think about the events over the last 9 years, anything is possible.  One thing is certain, if we do not gain control, we are doomed.  I believe all of this goes much deeper than race and that the racial conflicts are merely  by-products or distractions at best.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and maybe I am just a little paranoid.</p>

		<p>These controversies have followed conspiracy theories that the president was born overseas and is ineligible to hold office, and that his true religion is Islam &mdash; false rumors that some Democrats worry could be affecting the public&rsquo;s view of the president and his party.</p>
<p><br>
I had a good chuckle at that.  Because, this morning the Orly Taitz case took a major leap forward.  If all goes as planned, Obama will FINALLY be forced to display his US birth certificate, if he can (which, at this point, I personally doubt he can&hellip;.because it does not exist).  Also at issue is a possible birth certificate of his from KENYA that seems to have surfaced.  Although I keep hearing various Obama minions claiming it is a fake, none of them have advanced an argument I find convincing.  That is in stark contrast to the analysis of Obama&rsquo;s COLB he posted&hellip;.a BLATANT forgery that is EASILY revealed as such.  The Obama as illegal foriegn national pretender to the office isn&rsquo;t even close to being in conspiracy territory&hellip;..despite what the media says about the matter&hellip;.even on FOX news.  Onlike previous challenges, the judge in this case seems downright hostile to Obama and determined to get at the truth of the matter&hellip;.unwilling to allow millions of dollars of red tape being thrown at the issue to block so simple of a demand as providing basic eligibility documentation like the birth certificate.  Now, I don&rsquo;t believe for one second that Obama will give in to this (because he is physically unable to do so).  But, after this, most people in this country will be &#8220;birthers&#8221;.</p>
<p>As far as the islam charge, that is obviously true to.  Obama never stepped foot into a Church before he started his political career.  And when he did so, he went to one of these goofy new age churches that allows muslims and other non-christians to attend.  Rather than worship Jesus, that church engaged in communist, secular activism.  Nobody in that church believes that God exists, let alone worships him.  Before that, he was indoctrinated into Islam, at the insistance of his muslim father and the demands of the strict muslim society he was raised in.  This went on well into his adulthood.  All that is documented fact, curiously overlooked by the MSM.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s looking as if 2010 is going to be a repeat of 1994. Unfortunately, as a consequence of this, 2012 will probably be a repeat of 1996. We&rsquo;re going to be stuck with Obama for two terms for the same reason we were stuck with Clinton for two terms. The Republican Congress will thwart the more radical and odious parts of his agenda, that, if passed, would get him thrown out of office after his first term. </p>
<p>The Republican Revolution of &#8216;94 was the best thing that ever happened to the the Clinton Machine. If it weren&rsquo;t for that, Billary would be an ancient memory by now, just like the peanut farmer was thirteen years after his first, last and only term in the white house. </p>

		<p>One or two items for Obama&rsquo;s falling approval rate among whites is being over-looked; most of the whites who did vote for him were young, and the young have very short political attention spans. Also, they ARE naive, and the reality of Obama&rsquo;s actual presidency is surprising them, but mostly because he has compromised every radical promise he made.  But what he has been doing is quietly sneaking non-whites into every consequential government position that he can.  I wasn&rsquo;t worried about the hot-topic issues, it was just this that worried me.  The way this country is becoming The Black Trash Can of Former U.S.A. is astounding - it is just too obvious everyday.</p>

<p>Obama is a mere puppet. Both parties, the democrats and the republicans are puppets on a string. Obama&rsquo;s backers know that he will lose the next election. What we have to watch out for, is how far his backers will go in order to keep him in power, false flag events etc.</p>

		<p>So the Democrats will get busier expanding the non-white vote   &mdash;   through more and more immigration, illegal alien amnesty, felons voting, dumbed-down voter registration, buses to the polls, etc. Sure, they&rsquo;ll raise the volume of propaganda toward the most gullible whites that opposing our own interests is the least we can do, considering how evil we are. They&rsquo;ll also support &#8220;Hate Speech&#8221; laws to silence opponents, and keep letting anti-white groups like the New Black Panthers to intimidate white voters. But the Party of Change knows that &#8220;minorities&#8221; are their stalwart supporters, no matter how much the Republicans pander, and that the proportion of non-white voters keeps growing, day by day, year by year. </p>
<p>The only question is what whites will do   &mdash;   beyond we few who visit this website. Will whites in general ever stand up for themselves, while there&rsquo;s something left to save of the nation our ancestors made? Or do we really deserve this death march?<br>

		<p>Good posts, all. Along with the mentioned reasons for the downhill skid is the fact that the Big O made the fact that he is not a &#8216;Washington insider&rsquo; and made a cornerstone of his candidacy the claim that he would absolutely not follow the status quo of American politics. It turns out that (a fact that seemed to stun some people though I can&rsquo;t imagine why) low and behold, he&rsquo;s just another typical slimy, sneaky, lying, conniving, crook like all the rest. In fact, he may be worse.  Why anyone expected him to be a breath of fresh air I cannot imagine.</p>
<p>What is so frightening to me is by seeing all the quick appointments, all the hurried policies he&rsquo;s trying to implement, it&rsquo;s obvious that there have been multitudes of people organizing multitudes of things for a very long time in preparation for Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;reign&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s very scary to realize how much has been in the works globally for so long by so many.  </p>

		<p>I just have the feeling that everybody is getting way too excited way too soon. Three year&rsquo;s is an etirnity in politic&rsquo;s. Face the fact that in 2012 even if BHO is still in a free fall and the Rep&rsquo;s run a great candidate that candidate will have to win something like 60 plus percent of the total White vote to have a chance. The most loyal Republican block is Straight, Married, Christian, Southern, White, and Male, and the best they do with this group is probably 70%. There are just too many adjective&rsquo;s attached to their most loyal voting block. So their prospect&rsquo;s outside of that block are not too great. Also by 2012 the Elctoral College will have been reconfigured. People should not get their hope&rsquo;s too high this far out.</p>

		<p>Well, after reading the original article it seems as if the reason Obama is losing his support among Whites is because of his policies, not his race. Those same Whites who originally supported him, but don&rsquo;t now would, probably still support him if they agreed with his public policies. This doesn&rsquo;t sound too encouraging to me.   If they had taken the time to see how well black mayors have done in running big cities like Detroit, L.A., NYC and Philly, they would never have voted for this loser. </p>

<p>As for his popularity, at the start of the year it was +28. It just hit -13. That is a drop of 41%, the biggest and fastest in the history of American presidents. How many of you ever walked into a fancy store and had a high pressure salesman sell you something  that you did not really need or afford. A few days later you kick yourself. That is what is happening now. That is actually good news, only 60% of Americans voted, half of the for Obama, so about 30% of the population. That is the part that gave him the approval rating of +28, but 41% of those have now changed their minds. Leaves only 18% who are hard core supporters. </p>
