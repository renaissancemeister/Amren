<h1><a href="https://www.alternet.org/story/142311/why_is_itunes_selling_white_supremacy/">Why Is iTunes Selling White Supremacy?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sonia Scherr, SPLC&rsquo;s Hate Watch, August 31, 2009.</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;When the battle is over and the victory is won/And the White man&rsquo;s lands are owned by true white people/the traitors will all be gone.&#8221;<div align="right">  &mdash;  From &#8220;White Warriors&#8221; by Skrewdriver</div></blockquote>If you thought such unabashedly bigoted music was available only from underground sources, you&rsquo;d be wrong. With a few clicks at Apple&rsquo;s iTunes website, Internet users can buy albums and songs from white supremacist groups such as Bully Boys, Final War, Stormtroop 16 and H8Machine.
<p>But what has one iTunes customer particularly incensed is that the website has apparently removed homophobic songs by reggae artists, but left the white supremacist music. Galen Andrews, who lives outside Des Moines, Iowa, told Hatewatch that he thinks all hate music should be pulled from iTunes. &#8220;It made me sick,&#8221; he said of the white supremacist music. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s irresponsible of iTunes to offer that kind of music. I don&rsquo;t like the fact that they&rsquo;re selling racism for profit.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although Amazon.com did not return a phone message, it also peddles music from many of the same white supremacist bands. An Amazon.com spokeswoman told Fox News earlier this year that third-party companies were selling the tracks through its website, but declined to elaborate. A spokesman for CDBaby, which distributes independent music, told Hatewatch that the company doesn&rsquo;t ban artists based on content, though it donates profits from music it deems racist to anti-hate organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;My impression is that online music distributors currently aren&rsquo;t banning racist music,&#8221; Paul Becker, a sociology professor at the University of Dayton, wrote in an E-mail to Hatewatch. {snip}</p>
<p>Andrews, the iTunes customer, said he doesn&rsquo;t buy the argument that banning racist music inhibits freedom of speech, because artists can simply sell it elsewhere. {snip}</p>
<p>White-power music broker Bryant Cecchini, who uses the alias Byron Calvert, also hopes racist music gets banned  &mdash;  but for a different reason. &#8220;Shut us down,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Make it illegal tomorrow. It would be great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecchini  &mdash;  whose recent ventures include Project Schoolyard Volume II, a campaign that targets teenagers with a 25-song sampler of white power music  &mdash;  believes that prohibiting racist content would compel artists to find subtler ways to express the same message. That, in turn, would help them reach mainstream audiences. Moreover, he told Hatewatch, it&rsquo;s human nature to be attracted to the illicit. &#8220;What we do is illegal in Germany,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and it&rsquo;s fifty times more popular.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The SPLC is right in this respect   &mdash;   the ONLY reason why there are as many neo-Nazi German teenagers as there are (and there aren&rsquo;t that many overall) is simply because that ideology is illegal in Germany.  Unban it, and the count of German neo-Nazis go down by 99%.  Forbidden fruit is tempting to the young.</p>
<p>As for the subject matter at hand, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, I don&rsquo;t use lockdown DRM Apple iPod/iTunes ecosystem, (I do own an iPod-like device, but it&rsquo;s not an Apple iPod), but I think the gang-banger &#8220;gangsta rap&#8221; genre is available on iTunes.  NWA, Eazy E, Ice Cube and the like.</p>

<p>Ode To A Dying People by Saga</p>
<p>Eyes shining bright with unspilt tears, <br>
Thinking about all these wasted years. <br>
Everything worth living for is gone, <br>
Brother, i find it hard to keep fighting on. <br>
Falling down towards the abyss, <br>
The reaper embraces me with his kiss; <br>
It makes me want to refuse to care, <br>
To watch this all unfold - too much to bear. </p>
<p><br>
If this is the way it ends - <br>
If this is the way my race ends &hellip; <br>
If this is the way it ends - i can&rsquo;t bear to witness </p>
<p>Disease encroaching on all i hold dear, <br>
Somehow i gotta get my soul outta here. <br>
Heart of agony, faint burning hope, <br>
I&rsquo;m finding it hard to try to cope &hellip; </p>
<p>Because liars own the world with conquering poise, <br>
In a wasteland of meaningless noise; <br>
We don&rsquo;t stand a chance with dormant pride, <br>
The heroes of our race have already died &hellip; </p>
<p>If this is the way it ends - if this is the way my race ends&hellip; <br>
If this is the way it ends - i can&rsquo;t bear to witness &hellip; </p>
<p>To imagine it has all come down to this, <br>
Apathy and suicidal bliss &hellip; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all over except for the cryin&rsquo;, <br>
With a whimper instead of the roar of a lion &hellip; </p>
<p>The greatest race to ever walk the earth, <br>
Dying a slow death with insane mirth, <br>
The tomb has been prepared, our race betrayed, <br>
White man, fight the flight towards the grave &hellip; </p>
<p>If this is the way it ends - if this is the way my race ends &hellip; <br>
If this is the way it ends - i can&rsquo;t bear to witness &hellip; <br>
If this is the way it ends - if this is the way my race ends &hellip; <br>
If this is the way it ends - i can&rsquo;t bear to witness &hellip; </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let it end this way, <br>
Don&rsquo;t let it end this way, <br>
Don&rsquo;t let it end this way, i can&rsquo;t bear to witness </p>

<p>$PLC is all about the money. This is an attempt to embarrass Amazon and iTunes into doing penance, not by banning NSBM, but by forwarding dollars to &#8220;Hatewatch,&#8221; which is an incredibly lame, ponderously boring small font web page, written by looooosers. (The eye is looking up a pig&rsquo;s lower intestine.)</p>
<p>Hey, losers, the radical right is lookin&rsquo; right back at you   &mdash;   and we&rsquo;re laughing hard. We are inspired by love of family and community. You are inspired only by a base desire for cash. We&rsquo;ll survive and flourish long after Morris Dees is dead and moldering in his grave   &mdash;   although his greedy relatives and pals will probably be litigating over $PLC gold for decades. Bet his gold crowns go missing after the wake, too.</p>

		<p>Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, that the SPLC isn&rsquo;t worried a bit about the black racist lyrics of black rappers?  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much of it it makes pro-white music insignificant by comparison, but the SPLC chose to condemn white lyrics.</p>
<p>Why, I&rsquo;m so racist I&rsquo;m thinking that the SPLC might just be following a perverted anti-white agenda.  But what else could you expect from someone like me who has the audacity to criticize such an honorable, fair and balanced org as the SPLC?</p>

<p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but that song is a cover. The song was originally written and performed by a band called &#8220;Rahowa&#8221;. The lead singer of the band George Burdi has since renounced &#8220;racism&#8221; and married an East Indian girl.</p>

<p>Like the pornographers, and TV execs say, &#8216;IF you don&rsquo;t like it, don&rsquo;t buy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if it were done in a folk style, instead of that horrid heavy death metal style, I might buy me some off iTunes.</p>

		<p>I have posted this before, but it has been a while.  This is in response or to add to the Ode to a Dying People.  The idea is that a proper white religion would encourage us to fight for our survival and belief in a reward hereafter for doing it.</p>
<p>The Viking Prayer</p>
<p>Lo!  Do I there see my father!<br>
Lo! Do I there see my mother!<br>
Lo! Do I there see my brothers,<br>
and my sisters.<br>
Lo! Do I there see my line, <br>
back to the beginning.<br>
They beckon me to Vahalla, <br>
Where the brave may live forever!<br>

		<p>Thank you for posting &#8220;Ode To A Dying People&#8221; poster # 2&hellip;..It is amazing that the greatest race ever has succumbed to a few little words such as, racist. Sold out their children, their parents, their grandchildren, their ancestors who fought for our race. For shame on those who are guilty . They know who they are.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t new at all. Blacks have been at it for a much longer time. </p>
<p>For those who can remember, for instance, there was a very popular song back in the tormented  60&rsquo;s, during the civil rights protests and riots   &mdash;  -  &#8220;Our Day Will Come&#8221; (by Ruby &amp; the Romantics).   This featured cunningly double-entendre wording, masquerading as a love song, as was necessary,  but with a very clear racial message if you listened to it carefully.   Why didn&rsquo;t the SPLC notice back then?   </p>
<p>And indeed, when seen today in 2009, their day HAS come!</p>

<p>Set him down in central Detroit or in the South Bronx or Bedford Stuyvesant or parts of Philadelphia or Los Angeles, and make him live there for a whole year.  THEN see what he thinks about white survival music (if he has survived).</p>
<p>And btw, since when is white survival music, &#8220;hate&#8221; music?  Only to those who hate our survival!</p>

		<p>If iTunes banned all &#8220;hate&#8221; music they&rsquo;d have to ban almost all the rap.  So far as I know the SPLC has never complained about that far more widespread and lucrative brand of hate music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no fan of the music of Skrewdriver and its ilk (I&rsquo;d rather listen to Bach) but free speech is free speech.  The left hates free speech.<br>

		<p>Poliical correctness is not a bad idea.. it try&rsquo;s to allow for diverse percpectives and people types to cohabit peacefuly. The problem is that perhaps this is not meant to be at least on such a scale that individual groups must eventually lose an identity that they cherish. The masculine side of society is competitive and this is the aspect that must be sacrificed at the altar all inclusiveness. The fact is that very important aspects of nature depend on discretion and discriminating,.. these are always what seperate the mediocre from excellent or even the living from the dead. This I believe is the reality rising up in this instinctive groundswell of music that represents the repressed voice of white people that see their identity being misceginated into oblivian by the darker hordes that greatly outnumber them. Numerically whites are actually the minority, its only because their achievements have been so stellar that they always appear the dominant force, with others given minority statis. </p>

		<p>To acknowledge the very existence of &#8220;White Supremacists&#8221; is to admit you&rsquo;ve been brainwashed!<br>
We look at NO OTHER RACE&rsquo;S advocacy like this.<br>
We call La Raza a civil-rights group, when we all know their a brown-advocacy group.<br>
We call the NAACP a civil-rights group, yet we all know they&rsquo;re a African-American advocacy group.<br>
We can end the anti-white double-standards on race, or we can keep treating whites differently than other races, because of our indefinable &#8220;racism&hellip;&#8221;<br>
One path leads to a successful nation.  The other leads to civil war.<br>
If it comes down to war, I&rsquo;m siding with the  whites!</p>

Do you have any information/contact information on this current band that supposedly has George Burdi with Saga.</p>
<p>I liked George Burdi and understood the tremendous pressures that forced him to renounce WN and corresponded with him and feel he is a sincere man and still wants to contribute something positive in different ways.</p>
<p>Perhaps he/they can do cross over music, maybe just one or two WN songs like Ode to a Dying People.</p>

		<p>Sonia, here&rsquo;s the deal.  Black and brown haters have been selling their hate lyrics for years; many are extremely wealthy and many have been made movie and tv stars by our wonderful, value bound, film industry.  </p>
<p>Money is the key, even for media moguls who have the values of the gutter, and for you at splc.  Dees is the money man on hate where your concerned.</p>

		<p>Speaking of music and violence, I remember after the Jonesboro school massacre in 1998, pulled by two white boys, ages 13 and 11 at the time, we found out that the older one was a big fan of black &#8220;gangsta&#8221; rap hate &#8220;music,&#8221; and that the non-stop hate lyrics he heard over and over was part of the reason that drove him to do the deed.</p>
<p>A few weeks after that, President Clinton was somewhere in Oregon denouncing gangsta rap, citing it as a reason for Jonesboro.  The next day, he was at the home of the President of the media consortium that owns a lot of the labels that produce and sell hate rap, for a fundraiser.  And who was this label President?  Certainly not black   &mdash;   he was (and presumably still is) the white as snow Lew Wassermann.  </p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t like the fact that liberal Hollywood and the leftist state media have been selling their racism to us for decades - through ubiquitous negative sterotypes of whites and ubiquitous positive stereotypes of minorities - with endless happy presentations of mixed race couples in films and advertising. All this too, is quite obviously propagandistic &#8220;racism&#8221; - legislatively initiated and government enforced.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked, and see nothing in the Constitution conferring power to government to covertly wipe out an entire race. </p>

		<p>Follow up to my post 21:  The 13-year old was Mitchell Johnson, who was released from a Federal detention facility a few years ago in his 21st birthday, and (surprise!) has been in and out of trouble since then.  He started listening to the black hate rap on the countenance of any number of his teachers.  The 11-year old was Andrew Golden, I don&rsquo;t know anything about his background and whether he is still in or out of the joint.</p>
<p>I know with both, Arkansas was able to confine them until their 18th birthday, and then on the violation of bringing a firearm to a school, the Feds were able to keep them from the to their 21st birthday, although it is beyond me how that is a Federal object.</p>

&gt;The singer George Burdi is the lead for Saga. It is his pet project since leaving &gt;RAHOWA. So, technically you both are right.</p>
<p><br>
Do you have any information/contact information on this current band that supposedly has George Burdi with Saga.</p>
<p>I liked George Burdi and understood the tremendous pressures that forced him to renounce WN and corresponded with him and feel he is a sincere man and still wants to contribute something positive in different ways.</p>
<p>Perhaps he/they can do cross over music, maybe just one or two WN songs like Ode to a Dying People.(COMMENTS FROM ABOVE)</p>
<p>Let me clarify a couple of things. I listen to the music that the SPLC wants to ban. I have downloaded some of the songs from &#8220;itunes&#8221; onto my &#8220;ipod&#8221;, so I know what I am talking about. George Burdi was the lead singer of a band called RaHoWa(Racial Holy War). He wrote and sang the song &#8220;Ode To A Dying People&#8221; that one of the previous posters wrote that they liked. Saga, who is a Swedish woman covered the song as well as some Skrewdriver songs. She has a great voice, I own a couple of her CD&rsquo;s. George Burdi is in no way associated with Saga or Midgard, the label that produces music from Saga. </p>
<p>George Burdi is now in a multi-racial band called &#8220;Novocasm&#8221;. He is married to an East Indian woman. And he is hated by many people. He sold &#8220;Resistance Records&#8221; to Willis Carto who in turn sold it to Dr. William Pierce. &#8220;Resisitance Records&#8221; was a record label that Burdi started. He made great music with Rahowa, but sold out. End of story.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The lead singer of the band George Burdi has since renounced &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and married an East Indian girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the danger of assuming that non-whites can&rsquo;t be beautiful.  Oftentimes they are and white patriots may be caught off guard by them if they are not ready to face down the temptation to mix with beautiful non-whites.</p>

		<p>Shaun, Burdi &amp; Saga have nothing in common except that Saga covered a RaHoWa song. Burdi is now involved in a multicurtural group &amp; has absloutely no current connection to WN music. Saga has also done quite a few tribute albums to Skrewdriver. But her cover of Ode to a Dying People is a beautiful rendition.</p>

There is a danger in assuming that this has anything to do with beauty.  People marry for many reasons.  Beauty can be irrelevant.</p>
<p>If only beautiful people got married (and reproduced) then the world would be filled with beautiful people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for some strange reason, it is NOT.</p>

		<p>Hey, maybe AmRen should start a Music Review section!  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to listen to more racially aware music, but it&rsquo;s hard to know where to look.  The Resistance Records website was too extreme for my 50+ y/o tastes. (Agree with Post #10 that &#8220;death metal&#8221; is pretty much unlistenable.  And lyrics about panzers and 88&rsquo;s are pretty lame.)</p>
