<h1>Steele Says Dems, GOP Failing to Address Poverty</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Demillo, Miami Herald, Sept. 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele on Monday said his party must take steps to win over black voters, and he faulted both Democrats and the GOP for failing to address poverty.</p>
<p>Speaking at a historically black college near downtown Little Rock, Steele said Republicans and Democrats need to address poverty in discussions ranging from health care to environmental issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. King would be disappointed in the political leadership of this country for failing to address the least of us,&#8221; Steele, who is the first African-American head of the RNC, told an audience of more than 500 people at Philander Smith College. </p>
<p>Steele offered few proposals on how Republicans or Democrats could help address poverty, instead blaming both parties for not talking about the issue enough.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Steele also acknowledged that many African-Americans are frustrated with his party and said the GOP must reach out to the black community to remedy the situation. He said the party would need to take &#8220;baby steps&#8221; to win over black voters.</p>
<p>He attributed Bill Clinton&rsquo;s victory in the 1992 presidential race partly on the frustration many African-Americans have with the GOP.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Republican Party walked away from the black community in the late 1960s. It was stupid. It was dumb to pursue a southern strategy and it came back to bite them in 1992,&#8221; Steele said.</p>

		<p>In other words, he wants the Republicans to be more like Democrats.  He wants more government, and he wants more pandering to blacks.  Hell no.  We need a conservative party that unabashedly respects white voters and traditional values.  This is the problem with the RNC, they appoint a guy that is not in line with the base and they appoint a candidate, McCain, that is too liberal.</p>
<p>Reagan didn&rsquo;t win by pandering to blacks and he didn&rsquo;t lose any sleep worrying about whether Jesse Jackson supported him.  He won by unabashedly supporting traditional values and speaking out against big government.</p>
<p>But this is the future of politics as the demographics change.  You will be given a choice between somewhat liberal or very liberal candidates.  </p>

		<p>The strategy will do nothing but backfire.  By &#8220;addressing poverty,&#8221; Steele means welfare and other quasi-welfare programs.  The Democrats can always, always outpromise and outspend any Republican, even the most liberal ones, on welfare goodies.  The Democrats love people like Steele and their demands that the Republicans go more left-wing, because this gives the Democrats cover to go even further left.</p>
<p>Democrats will win every time in that scenario.</p>

<p>Why bring up an election from 16 years ago?  Why not 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008?  Oh, that&rsquo;s right because the strategy still works.  Hell will freeze over before blacks vote en masse for a Republican.  No need to worry Southerners, the Republicans will be back to grovel for your vote because without the southern strategy they don&rsquo;t have a strategy.  </p>
<p>I get these donation requests from the RNC it seems just about weekly now.  I&rsquo;ve been throwing them in the trash but I saved the last one to mail them a letter telling them to straighten up and fly right (and dump Michael Steele) using their own postage paid envelope.  I highly encourage other people to do the same thing.</p>

		<p>The Republican party is obviously on self-destruct mode. They could squash the Dems by being unabashed, unapologetic conservatives and not looking back. Catering and pandering to marginals and minorities just alienates every true-blooded traditionalist of which I am one. <br>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Dr. King would be disappointed in the political leadership of this country for failing to address the least of us,&rdquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>45 years ago King talked about the poverty levels of black Americans who had lived in this country for 350 years and were certainly entitled to jobs, welfare, medical care whatever was given to othe Americans.</p>
<p>King definitely was not talking about importing 100 million mostly poor unskilled hispanic immigrants to overload welfare, steal jobs from both black and White Americans and drive down wages of full time workers to below poverty level.</p>
<p>When King was active there were a bit less than 200 million Americans and the bogus Ford Foundation creation the hispanic race had not been invented.</p>
<p>Were he alive today King would certainly belong to the hispanic, asian, black, african, middle eastern, indian etc coalition against evil Whitey.</p>
<p>To compare poverty levels in the early 1960&rsquo;s when King was active and we had near full employment and enjoyed the most prosperous period in American history with poverty levels now after 100 million third world immigrants have stolen jobs, driven wages down to starvation levels and overloaded every public service from welfare to hospitals shows that Michael Steele cannot think or reason, and has no conception of cause and effect, logic or the non educators favorite, critical thinking.</p>
<p>In 1969 poverty meant one lived in the projects and bought food with food stamps.  In 2009 poverty means one lives on a bus bench and eats out of garbage cans, Calcutta style.</p>

		<p>Give a black a political position and his attention automatically turns to giving something to blacks.</p>
<p>I love to hear the dead heads assert that the GOP has to &#8220;reach out to blacks more,&#8221; as if just having a platform of values and goals, inviting all to join, isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>And the reaching out always amounts to giving blacks something for nothing.</p>
<p>Why would a black want to join a political party that believes competition is good and the individual should be allowed to advance on his own merit, when the vast majority blacks don&rsquo;t have enough intelligence to compete in a free enterprise sustem.</p>
<p>Their big thing is communism where they take according to their needs, while the honkies do all the real work and contribute their brain power, according to their abilities.</p>
<p>The only way the GOP is going to acquire more blacks is if they change their platform to support a state run political system.</p>
<p>The GOP is just another brand of statism, and the politicians from both sides could all become a snake with two heads and call themselves Republicrats.  Both are so corrupt they&rsquo;re worthless. </p>

		<p>There was absolutely nothing wrong with the Southern Strategy. Republicans addressed (at least in words and broken promises) the concerns of white Southerners about crime and the loss of their schools, cities and culture to blacks who despise them. </p>
<p>These Southerners were (and are) Americans. They do most of the fighting and dying in our stupid wars and contributed as much as any group to our music, literature, food, language, industry and culture. They had a right to air their concerns and these fears turned out to be well founded (just look at our interracial crime rates year in and year out).</p>
<p>Of course, every single president from Nixon through Reagan and Bush (both versions) took their votes through glad handing and pretending to like NASCAR, BBQ, Jesus and country music. In return whites got absolutely nothing but more affirmative action, immigration, race-based crime and multiculturalism.</p>

		<p>Perhaps Michael Steele should be called &#8220;the enemy within&#8221;.  Based on his comments, I have no idea why this person should be classified as a Republican, much less the chairman of the RNC.  Talk about stupid, he bashes the white voters in the Southern states who actually voted for Republicans and is requesting the party move to the left in a vain attempt to attract black voters, (13% of the population, probably less of the electorate) who always vote 90%+ for the Democrats.</p>
<p>The issue is not that blacks voters are unfamiliar with the GOP platform and this is why they are not voting for the conservatives / Republicans.  They are familiar with conservative positions and they do not like them.  Therefore, it is idiotic to spend a dollar of campaign money on them.  How hard is that to figure out?!?!</p>
<p>The RNC had better remove Steele from the chairmanship before he snatches defeat from the jaws of victory in the 2010 election.</p>

<p>The leader of the &#8220;conservative&#8221; party invoking Comrade King: just the sort of thing anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of American politics should have expected. This is exactly what ceaseless pandering to blacks gets you. If the Democrats were capable of managing something other than the creation of disasters, I&rsquo;d be tempted to think Steele was a DNC agent. Not really, of course; it&rsquo;s just the Republicans forming another of their circular firing squads.</p>

		<p>The best way for the GOP to appeal to black voters is to come out strongly against illegal immigration and mass immigration in general. Continue to point out to black voters that importing tens of millions of Latinos and Asians is not in their interests.  Remind black voters that they are being taken for granted by the Democratic Party.</p>

		<p>  I really believe the solution to all of the current problems is Charles Murray&rsquo;s plan outlined in his book &#8220;In our hands&#8221; in which he talks of redistributing the currently taxed dollars back to the American public at $10,000 each citizen, over 21, not in prison. After $25,000 income, it begins to be taxed back but even Bill Gates would recieve at least $5,000. Charitable organizations would overflow with donations. Government workers would be essentially out of business. Politicians would have far less power. Average americans would begin businesses.</p>
<p>  Think about it, the vast multitude of problems caused by underhanded redistributionary polices none of which could stand scrutiny of light can be for all intents and purposes be solved quite simply with Murray&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>  No more excuses for any minorities, no more undermining of institutions through forcing banks to make unstable loans, ect.</p>

		<p>This is what affirmative action brings  &mdash;  people promoted past their competence. The white party&rsquo;s leader is black and cannot see irony in this. More to the point: he refuses to see consequences in destroying the only major party that offers at least some protection from race shakedowns run by the Democrats (non-white party) and their associates.</p>

		<p> Tom #12, you&rsquo;re not getting it. We DON&rsquo;T WANT to appeal to black voters. Look at the mess they&rsquo;ve made of the Democratic party. We need a party that looks out for WHITE FOLKS, and ANY party that has a large number of Africans in it AIN&rsquo;T gonna do that. The Republican party will regret the day they turned their backs on White Americans when they&rsquo;re voted out of office by the VERY non-White hoards they now pander to! If the BNP [God bless them] can build a platform in ultra-pc Great Britain, than SURELY we can do the same here. If the GOP does not rid its ranks of spineless White boys, they are finished!!! </p>

<p>Ironic, &#8216;ain&rsquo;t&rsquo; it, that the biggest problem of the poor these days seems to be obesity and obesity-driven diabetes type II.</p>
<p>The best address to poverty is to stop its expansion immediately. The US cannot support a large, expanding welfare population, especially by importing a large, burdensome,  expanding welfare population.  This is what is destroying Kalifornia and is coming to every other state as well.</p>
<p>Anyone female receiving welfare should be fitted with the implant or IUD as an automatic condition. </p>
<p>From Jared Taylor:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;anyone who is feeding at the public trough, who depends on your tax money simply to stay alive, does not have the right to bring yet more children into the world for you to house, to feed, to clothe, to try to educate. No that should not be your duty&hellip;. For as long as you are dependent on society&rsquo;s handouts you should not have the right to have three or four more children&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>

		<p>Good idea! This would probably terminate the moribund and ineffectual Republican party once and for all. The Republican party does nothing to oppose the liberal Democratic party. In fact, it may help the Dems by diverting and neutralizing serious opposition to Liberalism. Republican factions spend too much energy fighting each other. What would probably be more effective (it could not be less effective) is 2 to 4 seperate political parties, which could encompass the anti-Liberal spectrum: Neo-Convervative, Paleo-Convervative, Centerist, Libertarian, etc. These parties could work together on common interests, but not waste energy fighting among themselves. </p>

		<p>Is anyone surprised?</p>
<p>This is par for the course for any black politician, regardless of the political ideology they claim to ascribe to. Most blacks are Communist/Socialist through and through; the case for even so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; blacks. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be completely honest with you: If Alan Keyes was a white man, I&rsquo;d vote for him in a heartbeat. However, I&rsquo;m all too familiar with the behavior of blacks in positions of power and how their policies are aimed to appease blacks only. The conservative ones play Uncle Tom around whites, but deep inside, you know it&rsquo;s just a farce 99.9% of the time. </p>
<p>Pandering to minorities, especially blacks, is futile anyway. Not only are they unsatisfied with anything handed to them, the Democrats have convinced the naive black demographic that the conservatives are the racists whilst at the same time supporting Affirmative Action and welfare; the very things that epitomize institutionalized racism and perpetuate a cycle of personal irresponsibility for blacks and ensure reliance on the Federal government. The Republicans, in response, are all too eager to please and their idea of &#8220;reaching across the aisle&#8221; is to feign opposition and then cave in anyway. It&rsquo;s the same reason Michael Steele was appointed: &#8220;Hey look, we&rsquo;re not racist! We even appointed a black guy that is unapologetically against our very own interests!&#8221;</p>
<p>We might as well just come out and form a political party that is unashamedly Eurocentric. It&rsquo;ll make the entire process a lot quicker and there won&rsquo;t be any second guessing as to where a potential candidate&rsquo;s interests lie. Any other race would benefit as well, provided they pull themselves up by their bootstraps and contribute to mankind. It&rsquo;s a (potential) win/win for all, but we all know that true equality is incredibly racist.</p>

		<p>Nixon&rsquo;s Southern Strategy was good, great.</p>
<p>The name isn&rsquo;t overtly RACIST, the strategy is good from our perspective - addresses real concerns of our people - safety, crime, schools and most importantly CULTURE - in that case Southern CULTURE (NASCAR NATION ETC), but we have many other forms of White North American Culture such as Boston Irish culture, Midwest Farmers culture.</p>
<p>Promoting  &#8220;Culture&#8221; issues - defending promoting unique White culture in America shows that the GOP has pushed the anything goes libertarian, economic conservative, capitalism idiots aside - which all WN must do every day of their lives if our grand children are to  have any hope of any decent life.</p>
<p>Best of all Nixon&rsquo;s Southern Strategy worked, the GOP won in national elections and even increasingly in local elections in the South a place the Democrats had dominated, monopolized for over 100 years.</p>
<p>As for Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele - the GOP has a Black Liberal Democrat for a party chairman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar for a future Pope being a Marxist Atheist who thinks the entire history of Religion is one of oppression, superstition over economic determinism.</p>

<p>Why?  His only issues are anti abortion and anti gay.  What help is that to us?  </p>
<p>Anyway, he&rsquo;s just a neo-con puppet, just as Obama is a CPUSA puppet.  Alan Keyes met Kristol in college. They became friends.  He was recruited as a black puppet for the neo-cons in college.  He has been a neo-con puppet ever since.  </p>
<p>I hate to keep repeating this all the time, people must be tired of reading it, but abortion, gays, guns, traditional families, christianity, less regulation of business, patriotism and all those conservative issues are totally irrevalant to our issue, survival of Whites in the face of theis slow genocide.</p>
<p>These conservatives have refused to form a coalition with us for the last 50 years.  They have their issues, we have ours.</p>

It was Nixon who instructed the EEOC to get really vicious in spring of 1969 as soon as he became President.  It was under Nixon&rsquo;s EEOC and civil rights (but not for whites) division of the Department of Justice that affirmative action really got going.</p>
<p>I know.  I lived through it.  I have done extensive research on the implementation of affirmative action and school busing from 1969 to 1976.  All the Presidents since Kennedy have been anti White.  But Nixon was the absolute worse.  He took Johnson&rsquo;s quota for 12 percent of the population and turned it into no Whites need apply policy which has been in effect ever since.</p>
<p>Reagan struck further blows against us.  He eliminated a federal exam that kept functional illiterates out of federal jobs that required BAs, and MAs.  This let in the flood of black female managers with pieces of paper that say MA but who read at 3rd grade level and cannot multiply and divide. <br>

		<p>Historically, the Republican Party was not the party of MLK, but the party of Douglas, a black abolitionist.  Historically, the Republican Party pushed for black emancipation and considered them equals.  The Republican Party was the one which historically expected blacks to have an equal opportunity.  The problem is, given the Republican Party&rsquo;s history, Republicans feel NO GUILT toward black slavery.  And there&rsquo;s the rub.  Historically, it was Southern Democrats who voted and fought against integration, against removing voting standards, against the equal rights act, and against bussing.  Yet, the blacks have since 1960 voted overwhelmingly WITH Democrats.  Why?  Simply because the Democrats were taken over by the liberal/leftists, instituted guilt as an institution, and began demanding equal outcomes regardless ability instead of equal opportunity.  The Republicans, having no historical guilt, saw those programs as federal government run amok and dangerously expanding.  However, the Republicans have now also been taken over by leftists and liberals calling themselves conservative, and are playing catch-up to the Democrats.  Folks, think about this.  Churches and believers WERE conservative and God fearing.  Now they are ordaining homosexuals and pushing liberal agendas.  The Conservative party is no longer remotely conservative.  And for a LONG time true American values and history has not been taught in the educational system.  Do you know why?  have you figured it out yet?  The marxists and socialist invaded those traditional institutions disguising themselves as converts so they could SUBVERT those institutions.<br>
And they&rsquo;ve done well.  </p>
<p>We must abandon this two party shuffle and demand each representative on every level be men of sound character, traditional values, family oriented, racially aware, and respecting the institutions which made this country great.  Not taking him at his word, but reviewing his entire past actions, legislation, and votes.  That is the only way to take back our country within the political system.  Abandon the two party smoke screen, and vote for the individual character and record from the local to the federal levels.  </p>
<p>We must take the time to throw ALL the bums out, stop looking for single issue panderers, stop asking for handouts, and vote IN those who follow the founders ideals - small government, free enterprise, individual libery (and responsibility) fiscal soundness, and abolition of deficit spending.  Else, we are lost.<br>

		<p>Organized:</p>
<p>And what did Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush do with their elections by promising white people they would oppose black radicalism (What the Southern Strategy meant)?  They went and did just the opposite.</p>
<p>With Nixon, there was affirmative action.  With Reagan, there was illegal alien amnesty, affirmative action in Federal hiring (elimination of PACE), and Martin Luther King&rsquo;s birthday as a national holiday, and the boycott of South Africa.  With Bush 41, there were H-1B visas, more affirmative action.</p>
<p>The Southern Strategy was a gimmick.  The only thing good about it is that it showed that you could win elections by advocating for white people, and one of these days we might actually get a real white person who runs on those issues AND actually follows through in office. </p>

		<p>Poverty ? Get your rear end out and work two jobs like I did for twenty years. Besides, working keeps you off the streets, out of the bars, and away of trouble. Those who are poor because they refuse to get an education or are too lazy to find employment will get no sympathy from me.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I hate to keep repeating this all the time, people must be tired of reading it, but abortion, gays, guns, traditional families, christianity, less regulation of business, patriotism and all those conservative issues are totally irrevalant to our issue, survival of Whites in the face of theis slow genocide.</p>
<p>These conservatives have refused to form a coalition with us for the last 50 years. They have their issues, we have ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hate to disagree but all these issues have to do with the survival of the White race.  Where exactly do your political leanings go?  To the left?  Most conservatives would not form coalitions with homosexuals or radical feminists.  However some kind of coalition could be formed with the labor unions and environmentalists (not the wacko kind) and promoting some kind of mixed economy with capitalism and taking into consideration government employees (White).  The government could be downsized and made more efficient just by exiting the minorities out of the system.  <br>

<p>Bill, I don&rsquo;t want to go against a fellow amrenner.  But, you skipped the most important thing in describing your ideal representative, someone who will activiely enforce the 14th amendment on behalf of Whites.  </p>
<p>That candidate whether for president or congress will  eliminate the EEOC, SBA, entire divisions of the Justice Department, Department of Education and other federal departments that discriminate against Whites rewrite the consitution to remove all power to make laws from Judges in equal rights for all races and be pro active in restoring the protection of the 14th amendment to Whites. </p>
<p>Your ideal candidate sounds like the typical anti abortion, anti gay, pro military, pro christianity conservative who could care less about affirmative action, out of control black on White crime and the continual demonization of Whites by the media and the educational system.  When I say media, I include many of the christian churches and the catholics.</p>
<p>These anti abortion, anti gay, pro gun pro traditional family whatever conservatives have their own issues. I have never seen any of these groups lift a finger or even be aware of the detrimental effects of affirmative action and media and academic demonization of Whites.</p>
<p>We have our cause, they have theirs.  I have tried to ally myself with some of these christian and catholic anti abortion women.  But they don&rsquo;t want to hear about affirmative action and black on White crime.</p>
<p>Anyway, some of those causes are hopeless.  Gays rule. Abortion is here to stay.  The only successful conservative cause is gun rights.  That is only because the gun rights people are funded by the gun manufacturers.  Have any gun manufacturers ever given any money to a White cause?  I doubt it.  Did any anti abortion crusaders work to pass any anti affirmative action referendums?  No. Did the anti gay people work on any anti affirmative action referendums? No</p>
<p>We are totally on our own and the family values anti abortion patriotic groups will not help us.</p>

		<p>Every time I see this buffoon in the media it reinforces my belief that both parties are controlled by the same elites.  It&rsquo;s all just a shell game with Michael Steele installed as one big joke to poke White America in the eye.  If they don&rsquo;t rid of this guy the big election wins they are hoping for in 2010 won&rsquo;t materialize and they may even lose some seats.  </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s how to cut poverty in America:  End immigration, except for about 30,000 exceptionally talented, brilliant people a year.  Deport every single illegal immigrant.  All those employers with jobs &#8220;Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221; will wind up resorting to their last ditch method of obtaining workers   &mdash;   raising wages.</p>
<p>But neither the Democrats nor the Republicans will ever even consider this.</p>
