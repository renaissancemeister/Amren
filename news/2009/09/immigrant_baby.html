			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), September 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 250 primary schools will have to be built over the next four years to provide places for the children of migrants, an MPs&rsquo; pressure group said yesterday.</p>
<p>It said the schools will be needed for 67,000 children who have a foreign-born parent and the cost to taxpayers will be around £1billion.</p>
<p>The bill for the schools is just one element of the impact on taxpayers and families of &#8216;uncontrolled immigration&rsquo;, the Cross Party Group on Balanced Migration said.</p>
<p>It warned health, housing and other services will face similar pressures and bills.</p>
<p>The figures on the demand for primary school places created by the migrant baby boom were calculated for the MPs by experts at the Migrationwatch think-tank.</p>
<p>They come after latest official figures showed that the population of the country is now more than 61million and the rise is increasingly driven by numbers of babies born to immigrants.</p>
<p>The breakdown showed there are now 607,000 five-year-olds but 703,000 babies under one year old.</p>
<p>Of the extra 96,000 children who will require primary school places in 2013, 54,000 have two parents who were born abroad, and 67,000 have one foreign-born parent.</p>
<p>Fewer than a third, 29,000, are children whose parents were both born in Britain.</p>
<p>Children of immigrants will need 270 new primary schools of 200 pupils, at a cost of £200million a year based on the figures which started in 2008.</p>
<p>Former Labour minister Frank Field and Tory elder statesman Nicholas Soames, who head the Balanced Migration group, said: &#8216;This research illustrates how uncontrolled immigration is directly affecting ordinary families.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Government have clearly failed to plan for the consequences of the mass immigration they have permitted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They added: &#8216;The research highlights primary school places but the same applies to health, housing and other services. This is yet more evidence that the Government must take steps to reduce immigration so as to prevent our population from reaching 70million within the next 25 years, as official forecasts now predict, if public services and the public purse are to be protected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Department for Children, Schools and Families said there were more than half a million spare places in primary schools. A spokesman said: &#8216;There is no nationwide primary school place shortage  &mdash;  there are over half a million spare places in primary schools across the country.</p>
<p>&#8216;Local authorities are under a duty to make sure that every child of compulsory school age has a suitable school place, and rightly it is for them to make pupil projectionsfor their area as they are most aware of the local situation.</p>
<p>&#8216;Schools in England have had a seven-fold rise in funding for building and renovating schools from just £700million a year to over £7billion now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The department said migration is falling and new controls will further restrict immigration only to skilled newcomers.<br>

		<p>The schools could be built for a fraction of the price in Pakistan, but Pakistan has shifted the cost to England.</p>
<p>Population of Pakistan: 170 million</p>
<p>Population of England: 61 million</p>
<p>Muslim Pakistan is laughing at England, impoverishing itself to look after Pakistani children.</p>

<p>Hmmm&hellip;how is a ten-times increase &#8220;seven-fold&#8221;&hellip;shouldn&rsquo;t it be nine-fold (like a 900 percent increase is 10 times the original)?</p>

		<p>ALSO! let us not forget the future incidental expenditures of Trials, Legal counsel, appeals and ultimately, incarceration and the myriad of costs surrounding the law enforcement factor involved.</p>

		<p>But the majority of imigrants to the UK in recent years are not from the Middle East but from Central Europe.<p>  The &#8216;Daily Mail&rsquo; is not the most tollerant newspaper in the UK.  Some might even call it xenophobic!<p>There are no immigration restrictions to nationals of EU member states, so they are free to live where they want.  There are repeated reports in the UK of these people (who are essentially migrant <b>workers</b>) returning to their homelands because the UK cost of living, together with the weakness of the pound, make it uneconomical to stay here.<p></p>
<p>Add to the balance the 400000 people who left the UK and the nett immigration is much smaller than the headlines and much more manageable. </p></p></p></p>

<p>When arguing on a forum like this it helps to get your facts right.</p>
<p>FACT: Most immigration to the UK is from OUTSIDE the EU (i.e. from Asia and Africa, not Eastern Europe).</p>
<p>For more accurate (although not infallible) information, go to the MigrationWatch web site.</p>
<p>Net immigration is a kind of demographic accounting scam; if two million indigenous British leave, and two-and-a-half million third-worlders pour in, we&rsquo;re not exactly exchanging like for like. Still, on such a calculation, the official figures will say that only 500,000 people have entered Britain.</p>
