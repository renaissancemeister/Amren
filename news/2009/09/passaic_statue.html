<h1>Passaic Statue Angers Residents</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexander MacInnes, Record (Bergen, NJ), Sept. 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What was billed as Mayor Alex D. Blanco&rsquo;s first attempt at celebrating the city&rsquo;s diversity and multicultural fabric has sparked anger within the city&rsquo;s dwindling black population, many members of which believe the community is being overlooked.</p>
<p>The event Sunday honored Mexico&rsquo;s independence from Spain and drew more than 10,000 spectators who came to Passaic to see the wildly popular musical group, Los Temerarios. Part of the festivities included the construction and unveiling of a plaster statue of Adolfo Angel and Gustavo Angel  &mdash;  the brothers who lead the Mexico-based group.</p>
<p>City officials allowed the temporary statue to be placed on the median of State Street  &mdash;  just behind the Speer Village public housing development, a development home to many of the city&rsquo;s black residents. On Monday, angry residents held a protest over the statue&rsquo;s placement, saying it was a slap in the face to their community.</p>
<p>Residents said the singers portrayed have done nothing for the city of Passaic or Speer Village, which is the city&rsquo;s largest public housing complex. Some said the black community has long had a strong presence in Speer Village, an area that is surrounded by a city that is predominantly Hispanic.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a population of black people,&#8221; said Rolanda Curry, a Speer Village resident, near the statue. &#8220;There are not many Mexicans here. This is right where we live. It&rsquo;s very disrespectful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The festival was the first in Blanco&rsquo;s plan to put on more parties to honor the various cultures in this diverse city. Blanco could not be reached on Tuesday for comment, but Anthony Iacono, the city&rsquo;s business administrator, said the mayor meant no disrespect by the statue&rsquo;s placement. The city chose that location because it greets visitors coming into Passaic from Route 21.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Iacono, noting that the statue will be removed from the present location sometime in the near future, said the event, and the statue, should be examples of acceptance in a city rich with diversity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tamara Morales, vice president of Casa Puebla, a Mexican-American social activist group in Passaic, said she was disappointed that there is so much protest over where a temporary statue stands.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should be more tolerant and accepting,&#8221; Morales said. &#8220;The fact that it&rsquo;s in front of Speer Village doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re trying to take over something that is not ours. We&rsquo;re not trying to step on anyone&rsquo;s toes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is one instance I very much admire the black community.  </p>
<p>&#8220;With this flag I claim this land in the name of&hellip;&#8221;   These words convey the meaning behind the placing of a cultural symbol.  Remember the accounts of Columbus arriving in the new world? Or take the military meaning&hellip;  the famous photograph of Marines erecting the stars and stripes at Iwo Jima.</p>
<p>What the blacks are doing is completely normal - they&rsquo;re standing up to a provocation.  Whites have been guilted so much by 40 years of propaganda that we meekly accept foreign flags, temples, languages and statues encroaching on our territory.</p>

		<p>At least Passiac got the day right, September 16, not May 5.</p>
<p>The only reason the Mexicans won that battle on May 5 was because the French had just landed and were laid low with dysentery, Montezuma&rsquo;s revenge.</p>
<p>The only reason the French left 4 years later was that the civil war was over and President Grant informed the French government that the United States was back in the position of strictly enforcing the Monroe Doctrine.  So the French left.</p>

		<p>Do any of the native citizens of Mexico celebrate the independence of the United States from Great Britain?  Somehow I doubt it.</p>

<p>Can you imagine a white community making such a statement?  Oh I forgot, there are NO white communities any more, they all ran away.  </p>

These blacks seem to take PRIDE that they&rsquo;ve had a long and strong presence at a public housing project. More proof that there is indeed differences between us that go beyond skin color.</p>

		<p>I agree with the black people here, why is a conflict between Mexico and Spain being &#8220;celebrated&#8221; on the streets of America? But, it is hilarious to now watch the &#8220;diversity card&#8221; being played against black people who love to play it against white people to get what they want.</p>

<p>Well, the low intensity race war between blacks and mestizos  going on in California per Sheriff Lee Baca, will eventually be fought just as vigorously in other states. </p>
<p>Already, there are incidents like this that are getting common and riots or clashes of some sort in other parts of the country between blacks and Mestizos.</p>
<p>Will the black/mestizo racial war expand into civil war throughout the country?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have far to go right now.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just in the housing projects in Passaic, NJ that Bantus have a warped sense of pride, but in other swillholes like Harlem, NY, Compton, CA, East St. Louis, IL and of course, Detroit.</p>
<p>What other race of people on Earth do you know, that take a perverted delight in living in blighted cities and neighborhoods? </p>

<p>You Lie!</p>
<p>The statues were deliberately placed in front of a black housing project to send a clear message to blacks that hispanics have enough numbers now to drive blacks out of  section 8 housing projects (and schools, and jobs and anywhere else they might be).</p>
<p>The same thing happened LA, first the blacks drove the Whites out of their neighborhoods (did you know that Watts and Compton were once White communities?  The Watts Towers were built by an Italian immigrant). Then the hispanics forced the blacks out  &mdash;   through blatant ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>Blacks have fulfilled their roll as the marxists&rsquo; useful idiots  &mdash;  a battering ram used to intimidate and atomize White.  They fulfilled this role well when they were needed. Now as hispanic numbers increase (as in the only thing that matters:  a voting bloc) they will fulfill the role of useful idiots.</p>
<p>Better yet is to pit each wretched ethnic group against each other and then watch the mayhem from the sidelines.  Blacks and hispanics are too stupid to realize that they are merely expendable pawns in the larger, main war the hostile elites are wagering against Whites and Western Civilization.</p>

		<p>The blacks haven&rsquo;t pointed out that they are surrounded by many illegal aliens who take blue collar jobs from blacks. I assume a few blacks would like to work if not the majority.</p>

		<p>Funny how minorities are much more resistant to diversity than whites while pushing thier own racial interests.   The next Civil War in America will not be fought  between north and south, but between blacks and hispanics.</p>
