<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/nyregion/25bhutan.html?_r=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th">Bhutan Refugees Find a Toehold in the Bronx</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kirk Semple, New York Times, Sept. 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly every immigrant group in New York City has a neighborhood, or at least a street, to call its own. But for refugees from the tiny South Asian nation of Bhutan, the closest thing to a home base is a single building in the Bronx  &mdash;  a red-brick five-story walk-up, with a weed-choked front courtyard and grimy staircases. </p>
<p>Eight families  &mdash;  more than 40 people  &mdash;  have taken up residence here in the past several months, part of a stream of thousands of Bhutanese refugees who have flowed into the United States in the past year and a half. </p>
<p>{Snip}</p>
<p>All of the newcomers are Bhutanese of Nepalese origin who had migrated to Bhutan or were descended from immigrants. In the early 1990s, Bhutan expelled tens of thousands of Nepali Bhutanese, most of them from poor farming families, accusing them of immigrating illegally. The majority ended up in seven refugee camps in Nepal, where they lived in bamboo-and-thatch huts and were cared for by international aid agencies.</p>
<p>Bhutan refused to take them back and Nepal refused to give them citizenship. In 2007, the United States agreed to resettle at least 60,000 of them. The first arrived in early 2008.</p>

		<p>These evil refugee resettlement agencies seem to have a sadistic relish for placing their charges in the least favorable environment possible, Somalis in Minneapolis, Bhutanese in the Bronx, etc., etc. This reveals that their actual motive, besides raking in six-figure incomes and kickbacks, is to use the refugees as pawns in the destruction of traditional white society, and hasten the establishment of the globalist oligarchy.</p>

		<p>There is no better, easier way to destroy a nation and its culture than to flood it with third world throwbacks to the stone-age.</p>
<p>Even during an economic collapse these types will still see an improvement over their living standards in the old country.</p>
<p>Sacrifices made during war time to assure the safety and security of this country were made in vain.</p>
<p>Our unrelenting march toward becoming an &#8220;undevloped nation&#8221; is getting closer to its goal every day.</p>

		<p>No neighborhood to call their own<br>
Weed-choked courtyards<br>
Grimy staircases<br>
Families that average more than five individuals each<br>
Thrown out by the Bhutan for being ILLEGAL immigrants<br>
The U.S. agrees to &#8220;re-settle&#8221; AT LEAST 60,000 of them</p>
<p>If I said what I really felt, AMREN would not post my comment. How much more are we, and let me be very specific, white, Caucasians of American descent, going to take? Seriously? Will it come down to a civil war? This country has its breaking point. I didn&rsquo;t ask other countries to over-populate themselves. The U.S. never &#8220;axes&#8221; me if I would like to VOLUNTARILY contribute to this suicidal mayhem, it&rsquo;s decided for me against my wishes. I don&rsquo;t mind paying my fair share of taxes, but damn it, fill the potholes in the streets that I drive to work every day. Am I alone?</p>

		<p>I cannot believe that the United States is playing patsy &hellip;  again &hellip; for a &#8220;hot potato&#8221; immigrant group that Nepal and Bhutan refuse to take.  Perhaps, if the UN would be doing its job it could resolve the matter between these two nations.  However, leave it to the suicidal &#8220;white man&rsquo;s burden&#8221; mentality of the United States to intervene and offer to take 60,000!!! of these people in.</p>
<p>In case the Federal Government has not noticed the &#8220;white man&rsquo;s burden&#8221; is bleeding this nation dry both with internal and external crusades.  Enough is enough!!!!</p>

<p>Did anyone think to ask why, before casually deciding to inflict them on us? If they&rsquo;re not good enough for Bhutan or Nepal, why in the world would we want them?</p>

		<p>Of course these countries refuse to take back their overflow population back. They know they have sucker country like the US that will take them. And isn&rsquo;t it funny that Nepal engaged in mass deportations of these people and the world didn&rsquo;t bat any eye.</p>

		<p>At least they will have shelter, heat and a place to cook during the coming winter months.  New York is full of White and black Americans whose ancstors came to this country hundreds of years ago who will are homeless while these foreigners are given government money to occupy scarce New York housing.</p>

		<p>This is the just another tactic that the government is using to reduce the white population in this country; bring foreigners here by calling them refugees.  Under this guise they can bring in as many migrants as they want by calling it humanitarian and usually without any objection especially from religious groups.  White people need to wise up to this scam by the government.  Look for these &#8220;refugees&#8221; coming from Africa to dramatically increase in numbers while Obama is in office.</p>

		<p>These people are NOT Bhutanese. Refugees [?] from Bhutan but not citizens from Bhutan. Bhutan kicked them out - - they were illegal aliens!</p>
<p>And everyone commenting is right. These agencies that resettle these folks put them in areas where they are not welcome and are deeply resented by the locals.</p>
<p>I recall some years ago where some Hmong folks were resettled in a crime infested area of Atlanta. Some project where the colored folks would not even live in any more. The Hmong WERE BEATEN UP ON A MORE OR LESS DAILY BASIS AND THE SO CALLED AUTHORITIES SAID THEY COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHY THIS WAS HAPPENEING.</p>
<p>We all know why!</p>

<p>Yes, but not just in the US; every single &#8216;western&rsquo; / white country world-over. The white majorities in the above-mentioned countries have to stop voting for major political parties that don&rsquo;t give a toss about us. <br>
Labor / Liberal (Aust) Dem / Rep (US) Labor / Conservative (UK) etc. </p>
<p>&#8220;Weed-choked courtyards; Grimy staircases&#8221;</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t this sorry lot pick out a few weeds and get a mop and bucket? Is that our fault as well?</p>
<p>Now shut up you lot and get back to work! The government needs your money.</p>
