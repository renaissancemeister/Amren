<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Visa checks on immigrants from Pakistan have been condemned as a sham.</p>
<p>Figures showed that just 29 out of 66,000 applicants were interviewed by officials since a &#8216;rigorous new system&rsquo; began operating last October.</p>
<p>The Home Office set up the &#8216;hub and spoke&rsquo; scheme last year to prevent terrorists, extremists, illegals and criminals from entering the UK.</p>
<p>The plan was to scrutinise candidates&rsquo; paper work in the Middle East before they travelled to Britain.</p>
<p>But data has revealed that just one in a thousand of those granted visas was quizzed face to face.</p>
<p>Home Secretary Alan Johnson has also admitted that not one applicant faced a telephone interview in the first nine months of the scheme.</p>
<p>The Tories said the statistics were proof that Britain&rsquo;s immigration controls are &#8216;wholly inadequate&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown and MI5 boss Jonathan Evans have stated publicly that militants from Pakistan are the biggest terrorist threat to Britain and the country is classified as a &#8216;high risk&rsquo; for visas by the Home Office.</p>
<p>Under the new arrangements entry requests by Pakistani and Afghan nationals are checked for fraud and forgery in Islamabad and are then passed to a processing centre in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>The Home Office said the system has raised the visa refusal rate for Pakistani citizens from 32 per cent in 2006 to 44 per cent by the end of last year.</p>
<p>Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said: &#8216;There are very real concerns that the system is being abused by people who have no right to come to the UK.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Home Secretary Alan Johnson admitted in June that all passports of Pakistani applicants are checked, but not always their other paperwork.</p>
<p>In July it emerged that the &#8216;hubs&rsquo; employ just 11 entry and clearance officers and two managers, meaning they have on average 11 minutes to examine each application.</p>
<p>The Home Office says a further 200 backroom staff process paperwork but the shortage of frontline immigration officers contributes to the small number of applicants quizzed.</p>
<p>Phil Woolas, Minister of State for Borders and Immigration, said: &#8216;Trained officers check 100 per cent of passports submitted with applications in Pakistan.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>It is clear that the goverment has been betraying its people for many years, they are not incompetent, they really want to bring as many immigrants as possible.</p>
<p>They want to destroy their own people and not any people, the British people contributed a lot to humanity.</p>
<p>RIP GB </p>

		<p>How shocking, the British government lying to it&rsquo;s citizens like the US government does to its citizens. They both talk tough in the press, but behind the scenes it&rsquo;s business as usual of doing nothing.</p>

		<p>Now that the economic crisis is forcing everyone to put their houses in order, an action plan and timetable for repatriation of all Pakistanis and those of Pakistani heritage is the only matter in need of attention. </p>
<p>Islamabad should begin preparations for receiving its Pakistani nationals, and the Home Secretary should be floating the logistical considerations of mass conveyance.</p>

		<p>Bear with me on this. In UK, we are taxed very heavily on petrol for our cars, this includes &#8216;green tax&rsquo; and in some mysterious way this tax reduces carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere. The actual fuel costs 22.56%, the retailer gets 6.14% (on which he will eventually pay business tax) and the remaining 71.31% is all tax in one form or another! We must pay a &#8216;congestion charge&rsquo; to enter central London to work, conduct business, deliver goods or take children to school. This charge is supposed to discourage us from entering London unless we have 4 people in the car. Seems OK, as this encourages car-sharing and saves fuel. Our petrol price is currently 106.9 pence per litre. Better sit down now, all you Americans, this is US$6.70 per US gallon! If I have a 9 year old son who attends football at his school on a Saturday with his best friend, also 9 years old and living a couple of houses down the street also playing for the same team, I cannot legally drive this boy to the same school, with his parents blessing, along with my son unless I have a police check certificate to say I&rsquo;m not likely to rape the boy en route. Same thing the following week when it&rsquo;s the neighbour&rsquo;s turn to drive the boys as he too will have to have one of these PNC checks which cost about Â£38 (US$62.70) each. We are constantly reminded that the DVLA (driving licence and car tax people) know every car and whether or not it is taxed and insured. No  paperwork and it can be towed away and crushed. Likewise, the TV licencing office knows every TV set in the land and the address of the owner. No licence, big fine or even prison. &#8220;Phil Woolas, Minister of State for Borders and Immigration, said: &lsquo;Trained officers check 100 per cent of passports submitted with applications in Pakistan.&#8221; But his office cannot check passports unless they are submitted and most are counterfeit. So how come this government would rather admit tens of thousands of alien potential terrorists from just across the border from Afghanistan with the absolute minimum of vetting whilst devoting so much time and effort checking White English citizens for non-terror threats in our own country? They also tell us that our troops are being killed and maimed to guarantee a &#8216;clean&rsquo; presidential election in Afghanistan which, of course, ended in a totally corrupted result. Why have a team of officers based in Abu Dhabi to check paperwork? It&rsquo;s not exactly the cheapest place on earth to live and work and we have lots of White English people right here in England who could, and should, do the vetting. It&rsquo;s because the team is not White English, that&rsquo;s why. Roll on next year&rsquo;s General Election when we will throw out this totally corrupt anti-English government with it&rsquo;s scottish prime minister and it&rsquo;s pro-islamic agenda.</p>

		<p>#4 - Yorkshireman:  Your good people are being micromanaged and taxed to death, while the gates are purposely left wide open for your replacements.  Either your politicians are very, very stupid and naive about the tribal conquering instinct writ large throughout history, or they are purposely betraying the native British.  As another poster once said, &#8220;There will always be an England, there just won&rsquo;t be English people living there.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I am inclined to believe that most top politicians in the formerly White countries have been bought off so they no longer protect their people from invasion and subsequent genetic dilution, while dressing up their betrayal as some sort of great compassion towards the Third World.  These politicians are importing anarchy for several reasons:  to increase their personal wealth and power, to increase the wealth and power of their financial backers, and to continue the marginalization of White people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Britain let in just about everyone who wanted to come&#8221;</p>
<p>What needs serious scrutiny here is exactly &#8220;who is and was Britain, meaning names baby names. Was it the &#8220;great&#8221; Margaret Thacther? Was she one of the ones who let just about eveyone who wanted to come in, come in? Was it Blair? A complete and total expose involving just WHO IT WAS, that pushed this is what is needed or whether it is Britain, the U.S. Canada, or any other western nation, the citizenry will remain in the dark and powerless to these criminals.</p>
