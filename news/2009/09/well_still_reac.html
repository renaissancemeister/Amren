			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kirsty Walker, Peter Allen and Paul Bracchi, Daily Mail (London), Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain will not take in hundreds of migrants evicted yesterday from the French refugee camp known as the Jungle, the Home Secretary claimed last night. </p>
<p>Alan Johnson insisted that suggestions Britain will be forced to accept some of the migrants were &#8216;wrong&rsquo;. He added he was &#8216;delighted&rsquo; French police had bulldozed the squalid camp near Calais. </p>
<p>However, evidence from France last night suggested Mr Johnson&rsquo;s optimism was seriously misplaced. </p>
<p>Many of those forced out of the Jungle at dawn by more than 600 riot police said they were still determined to reach Britain. </p>
<p>Among them was Afridi Kahn, a salesman from Pakistan&rsquo;s north-west border with Afghanistan. </p>
<p>The 30-year-old father of two young boys had already made several attempts to get to Britain since arriving in the Jungle a few weeks ago. </p>
<p>&#8216;In Britain you get a solicitor, pocket money, good accommodation, your health is taken care of,&rsquo; he said. &#8216;People have rights in Britain. In France you get nothing.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The entry of riot police into the camp at 7.39am local time led to violent clashes. Lines of men from France&rsquo;s feared Compagnie Republicaine De Securite, or CRS, filed in, some wearing full riot gear and armed with tear gas and handguns. </p>
<p>Also involved in the operation were 30 interpreters, three bulldozers, 12 lorries, and a team of tree surgeons. </p>
<p>Many of the immigrants, encouraged by a group of anarchists chanting, &#8216;We will fight, we will fight&rsquo;, refused to go. Some had to be dragged out kicking and screaming. </p>
<p>The worst trouble took place around the makeshift mosque, which the mainly Afghan Muslim residents of the camp had promised to defend &#8216;at all costs&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&#8216;It is the centre of our camp, and leaving it pains us massively,&rsquo; said Omar, a 26-year-old originally from Kabul, shortly before he was arrested. </p>
<p>&#8216;The police can try to stop us as much as they like, but nothing will stop us getting to England.&rsquo; </p>
<p>In total, 278 migrants were arrested, 132 of whom claimed to be aged under 16. All were male. However, up to 1,000 were thought to have fled before the police arrived. </p>
<p>Many had disappeared overnight, moving to other parts of Calais where they will continue to plan their journeys to Britain in the back of lorries or trains. </p>
<p>Those who remained at the camp  &mdash;  where diseases such as scabies are rife  &mdash;  were divided into adults and children, put into a fleet of coaches, and taken to detention centres. </p>
<p>There they will be given a choice to either apply for asylum in France or face deportation to their own country. </p>
<p>Some of the evicted migrants will be offered £1,700 to return home under the Global Calais Project, which is funded by the British and French governments.</p>
<p>British taxpayers&rsquo; contribution, likely to run to millions of pounds, is to help the migrants set up a small business once they return to their homeland. </p>
<p>The Refugee Council, a charity providing advice to asylum seekers, wants Britain to accept some of the migrants, particularly children, with family connections here. </p>
<p>But the Government insisted that would not happen. </p>
<p>Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said: &#8216;These people have no rights to claim asylum in the UK. Indeed, we would question whether they were genuine asylum seekers. </p>
<p>&#8216;If they were fleeing persecution, they have the right to claim asylum in the first country of entry if they leave their own country.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Mr Woolas went on to deny that Britain was an &#8216;easy touch&rsquo; for those wanting to enter illegally. </p>
<p>&#8216;My message is don&rsquo;t try to get in, because you can&rsquo;t unless you are a genuine asylum seeker.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Mr Johnson added: &#8216;Reports that the UK will be forced to take illegal immigrants from The Jungle are wrong. </p>
<p>&#8216;Both countries [Britain and France] are committed to helping individuals who are genuine refugees, who should apply for protection in the first safe country that they reach. </p>
<p>&#8216;We expect those who are not in need of protection to return home.&rsquo; </p>
<p>French immigration minister Eric Besson had earlier taken an equally hard-line stance. He claimed clearing The Jungle was a step towards making Calais &#8216;watertight&rsquo; to illegal migrants. </p>
<p>Just before the clearance operation began he said: &#8216;There are traffickers who make these poor people pay an extremely high price for a ticket to England. </p>
<p>&#8216;This is not a humanitarian camp. It&rsquo;s a base for people traffickers.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Calais shopkeepers also welcomed the clearing of the camp. British holidaymakers have been carjacked by gangs of refugees in recent months. </p>
<p>However, many fear that the migrants will return elsewhere  &mdash;  just as they did when the notorious Sangatte camp was demolished in similar circumstances to the Jungle seven years ago. </p>

		<p>There was one, and only one reason for this crackdown.</p>
<p>A vast increase in crime in the surrounding area committed by the so called refugees.  Seeing that the churches and other charities provided food, shelter and clothing, there is no reason for them to have committed crimes other than the fact that they are not poor pathetic downtrodden refugees.</p>
<p>Many probably have outstanding warrants in their home country.</p>

<p>Well I guess that pretty much settles the question of whether this is an invasion or harmless &#8220;migration.&#8221;</p>

<p>Right, funded by the &#8220;governments&#8221;&hellip;uh huh.  Just another ripoff of the taxpayer.</p>
<p>Gee, maybe I should go and try to get my 1,700 pounds too&hellip;I&rsquo;m unemployed and I can use the money.  </p>

		<p>Notice that most, if not all, of these migrants (and most black or brown migrants to Europe in general) are proficient English speakers; are quite capable of articulating their wants and rights; and are more than willing to exploit a system addled with universalist notions of freedom and brotherhood  &mdash;  a system eager to distance itself from the racist people we defeated, whose language we&rsquo;d all be speaking by now had we not won the war.  The Anglo nations are trapped by their own rhetoric  &mdash;  merely nations of &#8220;laws and immigrants&#8221;.  The proverbial chickens have become unstoppable.</p>

		<p>No mention whatsoever about how they are willing to work in UK to support themselves, pay for their housing, solicitor and health care. Well, those from Iran can flee to Iraq and vice versa, Afghans can walk over the border into Pakistan. Considering that they are &#8216;fleeing&rsquo; to an alien environment in UK, perhaps they should consider more muslim orientated countries closer to their homeland which include Oman, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain, Fujairah, Ras al Khaimah, Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Labanon, Palestine, Syria, Turkey and Yemen. Surely these places would be only too willing to accommodate their brothers in distress and offer them traditional hospitality and succour. Of course, this would not extend to permitting these incomers to lounge idly around insisting on free housing with food, medical care and pocket money together with state funded legal aid to enforce these demands although this is exactly what these &#8216;asylum seekers&rsquo; expect from the UK. Any AMREN reader wishing to verify my listed countries better not bother with &#8216;spell-check&rsquo; as mine produced more colours than an international soccer game.</p>

		<p>One wonders if the french around Calais sort of wished the American Paratroopers would not have defeated the Wehrmacht at Calais in 1944.Im sure the German conquerors were not as thieving and criminal as the new invaders. </p>

<p>It is so sad, even when they try to talk tough they just end  up sounding ridiculous. </p>
<p>Sure don&rsquo;t come to England unless you want to face the horror of having to make up some cockamamie story about being oppressed or discriminated against. In 5 or 6 years it takes for your claim to be processed, you will have to suffer the indignity of living off a government salary in exchange for doing nothing at all, while living in free housing where you will sire four or five children in order to soak up even more benefits.</p>
<p>At the end of it all when you receieve that notice telling you your claim for asylum is denied you just toss it in the garbage and blend into one of the thousands of 100 percent foreign, non English enclaves around the country never to be bothered by the government again.</p>

		<p>In one report, some of these - mainly Afghan - bogus refugees were saying &#8220;We are willing to die for our human rights&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s right, they are &#8220;willing to die&#8221; for their human rights.  If that were the case, then why won&rsquo;t they risk their necks in their own country?  British soldiers are dying almost daily, fighting people who would deny these &#8220;refugees&#8221; most human rights, while they expect to come to England and live at the tax payers expense.  This situation is just totally f(owl)ed up. </p>

<p>That statement is a sure sign of the times - handouts are now regarded as &#8220;rights&#8221;. Not too many years ago, accepting a hand out was regarded as shameful and embarassing. At least it was amongst white people. </p>

		<p>What about all the Democratic European nations these &#8216;asylum seekers&rsquo; have had to pass through in order to reach France, Yorkshireman?</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t they claim asylum in any of those? Why not France itself? I thought that was the general point, getting to a nation that will offer you asylum&hellip;</p>
