<h1>Obama as Witch Doctor: Racist or Satirical?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ashley Fantz, CNN, Sept. 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Posters portraying President Obama as a witch doctor may be racist, organizers of Tea Party protests say, but they reflect anger about where he is leading the country.</p>
<p>The posters, showing Obama wearing a feather headdress and a bone through his nose, have been popping up in e-mails, on Web sites and at Tea Party protests for weeks.</p>
<p>The image has stoked debate and cast attention on the rallies, which have drawn people Tea Party organizers describe as on the fringe and not representative of the overall movement. Their general viewpoint, leaders say, is that there&rsquo;s been too much federal government intervention, particularly concerning health care and taxes.</p>
<p>The witch doctor imagery is blatantly racist, critics contend.</p>
<p>Others remind that presidents get made fun off all the time, and the election of a black president has only made racially charged political satire more sensitive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And previous infringements of good taste don&rsquo;t make it acceptable to Photoshop the president into a witch doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s true that presidents before have had to endure some rough stuff, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with satire,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;President Bush was morphed into Hitler. That was not excusable either. Just because it&rsquo;s happened in the past doesn&rsquo;t mean there isn&rsquo;t a line and it can&rsquo;t be crossed.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a politics and African-American studies professor at Princeton University, Melissa Harris-Lacewell typically advocates discussion about the racist overtones in images or language bandied in public discourse.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&rsquo;m concerned in the age of Obama, too many of our public conversations about policy have been limited to a kind of investigative effort to determine whether opposition to him is based on race or substantive disagreement,&#8221; she told CNN. &#8220;The problem is, it can be both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harris-Lacewell points out that Obama made his African father a part of his campaign narrative. Now his critics are trying to mock that heritage.</p>
<p>&#8220;This witch doctor image is racist in a very specific way because of his proximity to Africa,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You can imagine there would have easily been a time when [Jewish New York Mayor Michael] Bloomberg would have been portrayed in anti-Semitic ways. You can go back to political cartoons when Irish Democrats were mocked, Italians were lampooned.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Spelman College history professor William Jelani] Cobb said Obama&rsquo;s election has also rekindled the historic rancor some whites feel against successful blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we have a black president, which means, on its most basic level, that a black man has more power than any single white citizen in this country,&#8221; Cobb said. &#8220;Whether people want to admit it or not, I suspect the Tea Party crowd believes that the currency of whiteness has been devalued.&#8221; </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another wrinkle to the witch doctor controversy. Obama was mocked by some critics as the &#8220;magical negro&#8221; during the campaign because he was perceived to be a solve-all to nation&rsquo;s problems. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;At that point, it was part of a somewhat cynical attempt to depict him as vaguely foreign and unknown,&#8221; Cobb said. &#8220;But now that he has control over actual policies, those views appear to have hardened, metastasized into something more vitriolic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Caricature is part of politics, but racist stereotyping isn&rsquo;t.&#8221; <br>

I don&rsquo;t see a witch doctor, I see a &#8216;traditional healer&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Are these critics ashamed and embarrassed by traditional African culture?</p>

		<p>I have to admit, I did laugh when I saw that Obama parody just now.</p>
<p>But one must ask, why is it so easy to parody black people? Why are there time periods or modes of garb that it is literally forbidden to show black people in?</p>
<p>Because it is so close to reality!</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s not-so-distant ancestors really did dress like that. In fact, one can find numerous places in Africa where they do still dress like that, and probably always will (and indeed, always should, if we&rsquo;re truly concerned about preserving other cultures). </p>
<p>Now some may argue, &#8220;Well, it&rsquo;s easy to ridicule a white man by dressing him in the garb of another era. Look at the Bush-as-Hitler parody.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that was dressing Bush as a specific individual, not dressing him in the traditional garb of his ancestors. Not the same thing at all.</p>
<p>And so, the hysterical cry of &#8220;racist&#8221; is the only thing that can and is used to keep people from pointing out the obvious. The policing method used is guilt, pure and simple.</p>

Not just the white man has been devalued but the entire civilised world. Obama is not black but his skin tone is brown, his mother was white and that is where he got he intelligence from, not his desserting father. Also to be black, both parents need to be black.<br>

		<p>I think this lampoon of Obama is being called racist because it hits too close to home. Check youtube videos of Obama visiting Kenya and look at the people around him. His fellow Kenyans are not far removed from the witch doctor photo.</p>

		<p>If a man of Celtic ancestry was president, would it be offensive to create a picture of him with bagpipes while wearing a kilt? I would not find it offensive, nor do I believe many, if any of us would.  </p>
<p>Could it be, that some are not ashamed of the so-called racists, rather they are ashamed of the African heritage? Perhaps they are ashamed that men in the technological world of today, are running about the land wearing little to nothing. Perhaps they are ashamed of men wearing bone piercings through their nose. This would make them - the racists.   </p>

		<p>If Obama were portrayed as &#8220;Superfly&#8221; trying to promote his health plan scheme, people would be howling about stereotyping as well. And yet, those same people claim the &#8220;blaxploitation&#8221; films of the 1970&rsquo;s actually saved Hollywood financially.</p>
<p>People foam at the mouth about stereotyping, because it hits very close to the truth.</p>

		<p>Now, Obama is a witch doctor - before, he was hailed as The Messiah. I doubt that Harris-Lacewell had a problem with THAT.</p>
<p>But I did. No politician should be regarded as a savior.</p>

The hypocrisy of the so-called &#8220;mainstream&#8221; news media just never ceases to amaze me. Of course the &#8220;Bush as Hitler&#8221; theme was excused by them, there was never any outcry about this slander from them his entire eight years in office. They only speak out now against it because their guy (Obama) is on the receiving end of it now.</p>

		<p>I admit that I laughed when I saw the picture because I always enjoy Obama being brought down a peg, but I hardly think that this picture can be called racist. First of all, the guy that Obama&rsquo;s head is super imposed onto is not even African, he is a Papuan from New Guinea, which is right north of Australia. If the President was a Chinese man and someone photoshopped his head onto an African dictator to protest his policies, would anyone suggest that was racist? I think some people think that it&rsquo;s racist because they assume wrongly that Obama is being portrayed as an African witch doctor and they think that Obama&rsquo;s African heritage is being mocked. Well, he&rsquo;s being portrayed as a Melanesian witch doctor from the Pacific, so the liberal cries of racism only show their ignorance and in fact, you could throw that right back at them and call them racist, since clearly think every one with dark skin is African.</p>

		<p>Last night I stood in my backyard and whispered the dreaded N-word, a word so evil not even this site will allow its use.  Upon uttering this word I was nearly struck by lightening, the ground opened up at my feet and lava poured forth in an attemot to consume me.  </p>
<p>I learned my lesson and that is that there is no other racial slur on this planet one is not allowed to speak in public except the dreaded N-word.  This is the result of blacks and their white Marxist masters wishing to control our very speech.</p>
<p>Now the Hispanics want to do the same and dictate to us what we can and can not call them&hellip;    </p>

<p>Translation: &#8216;It&rsquo;s ok to portray Bush as a Nazi because he&rsquo;s white and white people are Nazis so it&rsquo;s an appropriate stereotype that&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s not ok to portray Obama as a stereotype of African culture. That&rsquo;s just racist&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Liberals love nothing more than creating their little sets of taboos and totems, manifest in &#8220;speech codes&#8221; and all the rest. Ignoring what journalism majors and black studies professors claim one isn&rsquo;t allowed to say is a very healthy thing. Let them cry because someone broke the rules of a game he isn&rsquo;t playing to begin with; it&rsquo;s just an open admission that they have lost the argument on the facts.</p>
<p>In other words, who gives a damn what Melissa Harris-Lacewell thinks or says about anything?</p>
