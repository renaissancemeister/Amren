<h1><a href="https://news.aol.com/article/perry-ranger-teams-to-go-to-texas-mexico/666047">Texas Sends Rangers to Mexican Border</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Graczyk, AOL News, September 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Special teams of Texas Rangers will be deployed to the Texas-Mexico border to deal with increasing violence because the federal government has failed to address growing problems there, Gov. Rick Perry said Thursday. &#8220;It is an expansive effort with the Rangers playing a more high-profile role than they&rsquo;ve ever played before,&#8221; Perry said of the Department of Public Safety&rsquo;s elite investigative unit.</p>
<p>The forces, dubbed &#8220;Ranger recon&#8221; teams, are the latest effort &#8220;to fill the gap that&rsquo;s been left by the federal government&rsquo;s ongoing failure to adequately secure our international border with Mexico,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Texas Gov. Rick Perry speaks at a news conference Thursday on border security. He has asked the federal government to send 1,000 troops to the Mexican border, but the request is being held up by questions about money and logistics.</p>
<p>The governor early this year asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano for 1,000 National Guard troops and renewed his call last month in a letter to President Barack Obama. The request is bogged down over who will pay for the troops and how they will be deployed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perry said the effort also would focus on remote areas where farmers and ranchers have complained of being overrun by smugglers and gangs from Mexico in numbers that also overwhelm local law enforcement and border patrol officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Washington is shortchanging them, not giving them the support they need,&#8221; Perry said. &#8220;As a result, we&rsquo;re having to dedicate our resources to deal with the challenges we have along the Texas-Mexico border and ensuing issues that porous border has created all across state of Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the state would pick up the tab of $110 million, allocated by the Legislature in the past two sessions.</p>

		<p>Gov. Perry SEEMS to be on a fairly decent wave length.  He has  outraged and offended the moronic elities in D..C. with his threats to secede, so he can&rsquo;t be all bad.</p>
<p>The border is as wide open as it has always been, and we have an even worse non-caring president in who would just as soon have the population of the entire southwestern hemisphere in this country in order to water down the white power structure.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s doing his level best to destroy it all on his own.  He&rsquo;s making excellent headway too.</p>

		<p>Do not be fooled by Rick Perry. He is an ardent globalist. He&rsquo;s looking at a tough re-election battle so he&rsquo;s saying what he thinks Texans want to hear. In Texas we have not forgotten the Trans-Texas Corridor or his order for us to give our daughters the HPV vaccine.</p>

		<p>Why this is just so damn impressive, considering Perry has done just about everything a leader can do to facilitate illegal immigration into Texas.</p>

		<p>Texas Rangers will do better than army troops would do. An autonomous police force esponsible more or less to local authority, and not having to ask &#8220;permission&#8221; from the feds to do tasks that might strain &#8220;international&#8221; accords and agreements and such? During the war with Mexico, the Rangers were the shock troops who led most attacks and were noted for their gusto in combat. The old history is being resurrected? Also too, this is a clear indication of where federal authority has abdicated responsibility and a vacuum thus created is being filled by the local government? We will see more of this? </p>

		<p>People need to stop thinking that send an Army or national guard unit/s to the border will help. The composition of these units in mostly black or hispanics, so it is a loose loose situation. Special Forces and Marine Recon and Delta are of course, a different situation.</p>

		<p>Perry made some tough statements against illegals before his last election. Then, a week after he won, he came out and played the race card against pro border enforcement forces. He&rsquo;s doing the same thing right now, counting on the stupidity of voters. Of course, his republican opponent, Kay Bailey Hutchison, is an even bigger globalist shill. And the eventual Democrat? No need to even ask. It might even be a mexican.</p>

		<p>Perry is a globalist. I voted for Kinky Freidman last time. I have absolutely no confidence in either party and I damn sure wont be voting for Kay Bailey. We need outsiders who are not political correct to uphold our laws.  </p>

First,  I  would like to know the  racial/ethnic composition of these modern Texas Rangers, before I get too worked up with enthusiasm about this.</p>
<p>Oops!  I see  Skip has already answered that question for me.<br>
Yep, just as I thought too.</p>

		<p>I have suggested, in person and writing, to my congressmen and senators the idea of an AMERICAN FOREIGN LEGION made up of WHITE Americans the government would arm, train and deploy with plausible deniability to countries where there are drug lords we know of, child rapists, people smugglers and such to ELIMINATE said types and the U.S. government need not be involved and the troops would know they are on their own..Just make sure their EFT are on time and correst. Just a thought.</p>

		<p>What a laugh.  White Rangers are going to tide the flow of brown absconders.  Whites need to emploty the same tactics that brown and black nations use in their own nations.  Surely they are the ones to follow.  Why with all there work on civil rights how could we go wrong.</p>

		<p>     Remember this border mess really escalated during the regime of Bush the idiot. He and that villian Rove sold out the US. I&rsquo;m sure Bush the idiot is sitting prettily in a nice all-white neighborhood in big D, while the rest of us are dealing with a full scale invasion. To Bush the idiot I say you are a traitor and scalawag.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s those very farmers and ranchers who hire illegal alien mexicans which encourages them to invade the United States.  I don&rsquo;t feel any empathy at all for Texas farmers who are endangered by illegal invaders.  The Texas farmers and ranchers invited them in the first place.</p>

		<p>I have said it before, and I&rsquo;ll say it again. Deputize the Minutemen, and send them to the Border, with High Powered Rifles, and 1,000 rounds of ammunition. That will take care of the Border problems.</p>

<p>Gary, to be more exact&hellip;.a scalawag is a Southerner who curries favor with the invader, a Quisling, who slavishly serves his Yankee masters for the few dollars they put in his pocket. Mr. Bush is no scalawag&hellip;.he is a full-blown Connecticut Yankee carpetbagger, who helped himself to a Southern woman and tried desperately to make money in the South. He did not attend school in the South, he was Yankee bred and Yankee educated.</p>

As a friendly Northerner, I have no argument with you Ma&rsquo;am. None at all.  But let me point out that the Bushes weren&rsquo;t much of &#8220;Yankees&#8221; either, they were just passing through, so to speak, and Dubya was just born there.  His father or grandfather was, ahem, a &#8220;carpetbagger&#8221;  who came to Connecticut from Missouri, I believe.  (No offense meant to Missourians either.) Like nomads, they move on from generation to generation, going where the grass looks greener. (Or the money looks greener.)</p>

		<p>5 SKIP says that the Army and National Guard are mostly Black or Hispanic, but it seems to me that I&rsquo;ve read postings here that claim that 85% of our casualties in Iraq are White men.  If so, then about 85% of the infantry must be White too.  So which jobs and units are full of non-Whites?  Or is that casualty figure of mine wrong?  </p>
