<h1>11 Accused of Faking Voter Registration Cards in Miami-Dade</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Lebovich, Miami Herald, September 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eleven people hired to register potential voters in Miami-Dade County before last year&rsquo;s presidential election were being sought Wednesday for falsifying hundreds of voter registration cards.</p>
<p>The Miami-Dade State Attorney&rsquo;s Office issued arrest warrants for each of the 11 suspects, all of whom worked for the local chapter of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, (ACORN).</p>
<p>By early Wednesday morning, six were in custody, authorities said.</p>
<p>ACORN came under fire during last year&rsquo;s presidential campaign when Republicans and other conservative groups accused the national organization of committing fraud in its aggressive voter registration efforts in various cities and counties nationwide, including Florida.</p>
<p>But ACORN officials said they had alerted authorities about the alleged illegal activity among some canvassers in Miami-Dade after finding &#8220;numerous discrepancies&#8221; on voter cards collected from the Homestead area.</p>
<p>The arrests are &#8220;further evidence we&rsquo;ve been policing our own folks and report people attempting to commit voter registration fraud,&#8221; said ACORN spokesman Brian Kettenring. &#8220;This was really some individuals who were trying to defraud their employer.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The workers, who were paid between $8 and $10 an hour, registered names of nonexistent people  &mdash;  in one case, Paul Newman and James Taylor appeared on cards  &mdash;  or simply filled out several cards for the same real voter, authorities said.</p>

		<p>When I first registered to vote in 1980 I had to go in person to the county courthouse.  There was no mail-in or motor voter registration.  Why in heaven&rsquo;s name is it too much to ask people to register in person and present ID?  If it is that much of a bother then that person shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to vote.  Voting should be considered a valued part of citizenship and anything of value should be protected.  But our politicians do not believe in the value of honest elections and neither do most of us.</p>

		<p>(from the article): <i>&hellip; in one case, Paul Newman and James Taylor appeared on cards &hellip;</i></p>
<p>Just further proof that dead people are the Democrats&rsquo; 2nd biggest voting bloc (after blacks). Paul Newman really is dead, and James Taylor does a great impersonation of a dead person any time he sings.</p>

		<p>One must wonder if Obama really won the presidential race or was his victory fixed by the Acorn people.</p>

		<p>The workers were &#8220;defrauding their employer&#8221; for an employer actively defrauding the American vote system. Sounds like a double-whammy to me. Modern American Liberals are often crooks operating and hiding in the shadows of lies.</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s crew knew they would get over 90% of the African votes from the start&hellip;however, there just weren&rsquo;t enough of those votes to ensure a victory.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ACORN criminals were engaged to stuff the ballot box.</p>
<p>Sounds the same as any other third world African country.</p>
