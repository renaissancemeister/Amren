<h1>Miami Activist Mounts Campaign Against CNN&rsquo;s Lou Dobbs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Brown, Miami Herald, Sept. 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Miami-based Hispanic group is mounting a national campaign against conservative CNN talk-show host Lou Dobbs, urging the network to restrain what they call &#8220;his disparaging and inaccurate&#8221; remarks about Hispanic immigrants.</p>
<p>Jorge Mursuli, a longtime human rights activist in South Florida who now heads Democracia U.S.A., hopes to create a grassroots movement to silence Dobbs&rsquo; unrelenting crusade against illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Mursuli contends that Dobbs has blamed immigrants for a rise in leprosy in the United States, of pushing for a so-called &#8220;superhighway&#8221; of illegal immigrants from Mexico to Canada and contributing to an illegal immigrant crime wave. </p>
<p>&#8220;If CNN is, in fact, the most trusted name in news, we really have to ask them to hold Mr. Dobbs to journalistic standards,&#8221; said Mursuli, whose group plans to launch an anti-Dobbs website, www.EnoughisEnough!.com.</p>
<p>The campaign is the latest backlash against the TV anchor. Other immigration groups have gone further, demanding the network pull him off the air for his conservative anti-immigration politics. Dobbs, whose wife is Mexican-American, is one of the network&rsquo;s most popular talk show hosts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As part of his campaign, Mursuli said his organization asked a Miami-based polling firm to conduct interviews with 100 Hispanic people  &mdash;  most of them political, business, community and congressional leaders across the nation.</p>
<p>He said the survey showed that 90 percent of the participants believe Dobbs is a demagogue who is using his show as a pulpit to preach hate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dobbs has a right to his opinion, but he also needs to stick with the facts,&#8221; said Mursuli, a Cuban native who has been active in gay, lesbian and other civil rights causes.</p>
<p>For the past four years, he has been CEO of Democracia U.S.A., one of the nation&rsquo;s most vocal Hispanic civic engagement, voter empowerment and leadership training groups. Since its founding in Florida in 2004, the group&rsquo;s efforts have expanded to Arizona, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It has a partnership with the National Council of La Raza, the largest national Hispanic civil rights group in the country. <br>

		<p>La Raza is an anti-American organization, bent on &#8220;changing&#8221; the United States to a replica of the third world their followers escape from. Lots of changes going on. Those who voted for it need to rethink what&rsquo;s happened since Nov. 4. As long as our President and many in Congress think that by waving the magic wand of amnesty it will cure the ills of illgal immigration, they have another think coming. There are too many patriots in this country to let the US turn into the next third world. Keep letting your voice be heard. Speak out against the invaders.</p>

		<p>I never took the logic course in college, but I can pretty well argue with any point that I disagree with. Censorship is the resort of the person or group with no counter-argument. Calling for someone to be silenced is basically admitting that even though you don&rsquo;t agree with them, they&rsquo;re right. </p>

<p>I hope his followers will be able to find jobs so they can afford to spend time protesting instead of looking for work.</p>

		<p>He should return to Cuba where he can live happily under the authoritarianism he so deeply craves. We have freedom of speech here in this country and political free speech is the most protected. When will these immigrants learn that free speech is desirable?</p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs is on Jorge&rsquo;s side!  He supports massive legal immigration, the termination of our European heritage, and the &#8220;Hispanization&#8221; of America.  And he is a race traitor!  My gosh Jorge, the man is almost your brother!</p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs is pretty much the only honest man in the mainstream media on the issue of illegal immigration.  So of course the SPLC and the Hispanic activists have their knives out for him.</p>

<p>Lou Dobbs, Glenn Beck, total fakes, just traitors, much like wrestling.</p>
<p>There is no way CNN would allow anyone to be seriously anti immigration on their program time.</p>

		<p>I watched Dobbs consistently for some weeks because he did report and comment consistently on illegal immigration and the deleterious effect it has on our country.  He never had a problem with legal immigraiton, including Hispanic.  More recently he even opined that he thought it wise for Obama to just present his long form birth certificate and put his elgibility question to rest.  Lou Dobbs has not mentioned the birth certificate or immigration for some time.  I think CNN has restrained his discussion of either subject, regardless of the activist Hispanics.  I don&rsquo;t hear his radio show so I don&rsquo;t know what subjects he concentrates on there.</p>
<p>I am getting really tired of pressure groups, in and out of the administration, trying to restrict &#8216;free speech&rsquo; to only that speech they regard as politically correct.  I&rsquo;m sure those in favor of &#8216;approved speech&rsquo; could find a country practicing such.</p>

		<p>Istvan is correct. Dobbs supports massive legal immigration, which is much more numerous than illegal immigration. For all his chatter, he is useless on the real immigration issues, which is mainly the outrageously sky high numbers.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Mursuli contends that Dobbs has blamed immigrants for a rise in leprosy in the United States, of pushing for a so-called &#8216;superhighway&rsquo; of illegal immigrants from Mexico to Canada and contributing to an illegal immigrant crime wave.</p>
<p>&#8216;Mr. Dobbs has a right to his opinion, but he also needs to stick with the facts,&rsquo; said Mursuli&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The journalist should have immediately pounced on this and demanded that mursuli disprove dobbs&rsquo;s contention, with facts, of course. She could have easily exposed mursuli for the marxist fool he is.</p>
<p>But, as most journalists and the msm agree with mursuli, and despise facts that disprove their NWO vision, this will never happen and jerks like mursuli will be allowed to pontificate, without rebuttal, in the media against White Americans that don&rsquo;t agree with their displacement.</p>
<p>At least the Internet (for now) is as accessible as the Miami Herald  &mdash;  may it go down in flames as is the NYT and LA Times.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t that strange, absolutely bizzare?  One of the principle charges levied against people who want to keep America and the West a White, European, Judeo/Christian based civilization is that those persons are inherently hate-filled racists vis-a-vis non White people.  And here   &mdash;   surprise, surprise!   &mdash;   Lew Dobbs has an Hispanic wife.  (A fact which I did not know.)</p>
<p>This fact kind of blows that argument right out of the water, doesn&rsquo;t it?   </p>

		<p>There is this myth that Cubans are right-wing.  What that means is that white refugees from Cuba are anti-Castro, so they gravitate more towards the party that opposes communism more, i.e. the Republicans.</p>
<p>But as of late, more and more &#8220;Cubans&#8221; in South Florida are Afro-Caribbean or mulatto-Caribbean.  Therefore, the black in them makes them left-wing (usually), therefore &#8220;Cubans&#8221; are voting more and more left wing.</p>
