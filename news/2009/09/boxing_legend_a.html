			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shawn Pogatchnik, AP, September 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Muhammad Ali made a sentimental journey Tuesday to discover his Irish roots, and met distant relatives during celebrations at the local town hall and a nearby castle.</p>
<p>Thousands lined the streets of Ennis, western Ireland, to cheer his motorcade as the three-time heavyweight champion visited the home of his great-grandfather Abe Grady.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Grady settled in Kentucky in the 1860s and married a freed slave. One of their grandchildren, Odessa Lee Grady Clay, gave birth to Ali  &mdash;  then Cassius Clay  &mdash;  in 1942.</p>
<p>Genealogists pinpointed Ali&rsquo;s Irish links in 2002, but Ali had never visited Ennis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at Muhammad&rsquo;s pugilistic skills and his loquacious ways, I am sure if his great-grandfather was alive, he would swear it came from him,&#8221; she [Ali&rsquo;s wife] said. &#8220;If he were alive today I bet he would be in every pub talking about it too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayor Frankie Neylon presented Ali with a scroll and proclaimed him Ennis&rsquo; first &#8220;freeman,&#8221; an honor conveying him special privileges in the County Clare town of 23,000. The mayor said the most valuable privilege would be free parking.</p>
<p>Yolanda Ali said the couple would return to Ireland &#8220;now that we know that Muhammad is an Ennisman.&#8221;</p>
<p>People traveled hundreds of miles from across Ireland to see Ali, among them veteran Irish boxers who sparred with Ali in New York training decades ago.</p>
<p>Former Irish national champ Jim O&rsquo;Sullivan recalled sparring with Ali and his trainer Angelo Dundee during a U.S. tour by Irish boxers in 1978  &mdash;  and wished he&rsquo;d known then that &#8220;The Greatest&#8221; was &#8220;just a Paddy like us.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Sorry to see &#8220;paddy&#8221; validated on this web site.  It is clearly reserved for Irish to Irish discourse, and bears roughly the same relationship that exists among black African Americans that is reserved for the so-called N word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s posting violates this site&rsquo;s ban on insults.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paddy&#8221; was a highly popular term for the diverse white American men during the 1970&rsquo;s and 1980&rsquo;s in the Latino &amp; black communities, so its insulting nature in the USA isn&rsquo;t reserved for Irish only.</p>
<p>It really isn&rsquo;t fitting to appear on this web site in any version without explanation.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s had Parkinson&rsquo;s for quite a while now, and has been nothing but a shell of a man.  Too many punches to the head, I read, brought the ailment on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange he was so light-skinned with a white relative so far back in his lineage.  I&rsquo;m thinking he probably had another relative or two that was white also.</p>

<p>Just for the record, that was the AP&rsquo;s doing.  However, since I know that &#8220;P***y&#8221; can be an ethnic slur, what connotations is its use a slur?  I know of at least six people, half men, half women, who call themselves &#8220;P***y.&#8221;  Is that akin to blacks calling themselves the n-word but woe unto the cracker who uses it?</p>

		<p>I had a sniff of Ali`s greatness while watching an interview with his Aunt. When he was five he asked her what that sign thing was,  made of light bulbs going all the way around the  edge of a building  and how did somebody get one. His Aunt laughed and said, &#8220;Honey, that`s called a marquee&hellip; you can`t buy one. You have to be somebody famous for them to give you one.&#8221; And  young Cassius toddled of muttering, &#8220;I`m gonna get me a marquee.&#8221; After seeing that, I looked up Neon signs and supplies in the Yellow pages and muttered to myself, &#8220;I`m gonna learn how to wire me  a marquee!&#8221;  </p>

		<p>An African with Irish ancestry is not an Irishman aor Irishwoman. If you buy into the view that Ali and other black_-Irish mixes are Irish, you are openning the door to race-replacement in Ireland. Ireland now has its first Ghaninan mayor. Do not provide a ideological justification for the race-replacement for the Irish in Ireland. If you do, it will happen very fast. And with race-raceplacement with these fake Irish will also come the replacement of Irish culture and music.</p>
<p>Just wait, mohammad ali will be used to justify the race-replacement of the Irish in Ireland. Hey, If Ali is Irish what&rsquo;s the big deal if the Irish open the floodgates to african immigration&hellip;this the propaganda they will use.</p>
<p>Nothing less than uncompromising resistance to race-replacement is acceptable. </p>

		<p>The one thing I have always said is that africans will insinuate themselves into any and every culture on earth as though they were the ones involved in making it great, rather than being the offspring of a slave involved with a master or an ex master.  Absolutely nothing that Cassius Clay did was anything to help the Irish people.  The Irish people were great all by themselves, they don&rsquo;t need even more africans to destroy any native culture they have left.  </p>

		<p>Jupiter is so right:   An African with a stray drop of Irish blood is not an Irishman!  He&rsquo;s an embarassment.  </p>
<p>They can (and will) use this now as propaganda to &#8220;justify race-replacement of the Irish in Ireland&#8221; and to foster miscegenation and African immigration.  How convenient!  (Who&rsquo;s sponsoring and promoting this trip?  When I visited Ireland, nobody gave me newspaper coverage. No journalists were hanging on my words and no politicians were kissing my feet.)</p>
<p>Btw, did that ancestor actually &#8220;marry&#8221; that black woman? I wonder. Or is that just a sort of tidied up account of their relationship?  If he really did marry her (I&rsquo;m dubious that it would even have been legal or possible in Kentucky), he would have been viewed as a degenerate and a reproprobate by all of his own kind   &mdash;   certainly no one to be proud of.</p>
<p>Oh, another thing, if Mr. Clay is so proud of his newfound Irish ancestry, why doesn&rsquo;t he change his name to Paddy instead of Mohammed?  That would show some sincerity. I don&rsquo;t know that he claims any Arab ancestors.</p>
<p>And Mr. McHugh, I assume you&rsquo;re being ironic when you speak of &#8220;Ali&rsquo;s greatness&#8221;.   I can&rsquo;t imagine any other interpretation!</p>

<p>I take no offense at it either. It&rsquo;s just a nickname. Are we trying to rival some other touchy groups in contesting who can have the thinnest skin?  </p>
<p>I agree with Anonymous. Let&rsquo;s not help &#8220;the PC maniacs&#8221; [well put!]  and be dragged into their game.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use offensive racial or ethnic terms myself. Why don&rsquo;t I?  Because it sould say much more about ME than about THEM   &mdash;    it would say something highly uncomplimentary.  Such words have a mirror effect; they reflect unfavorably on the speaker. It doesn&rsquo;t pay to use them.</p>
<p>But personally, it doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all when they use such words as Honkey and Cracker. They&rsquo;re all a joke.  Such words are childish and <i><b>they say more about the speaker than the object. </b></i>  I just laugh them off. That is the most maddening frustration to those who want such words to carry a sting. It infuriates them when you&rsquo;re not insulted.  You&rsquo;re SUPPOSED TO BE!  Why play along with them and give them what they want?  Just ignore them.  The most disarming weapon is laughter.</p>
<p>Just consider: Why do &#8220;they&#8221; have to change their name to something new every so many years?   Why is the so-called &#8220;N-word&#8221; viewed by the whole world so unfavorably?  Is it due to unpleasant connotations that WHITES have given it?  Or on the other hand, is it really  because <b><i>they have so badly tarnished it themselves that they have made it unspeakable? </i></b> And so they have to find another one.</p>
<p>I predict the time will come when &#8220;African-American&#8221; will be considered a terrible insult and will be banned    &mdash;  - just like all its predecessors.</p>

		<p>My grandmother came to America at the age of 19 and became a naturalized citizen. She never once afterwards referred to herself as an Irishwoman, nor yet as Irish-American. She was an American and proud of it. I guarantee you she wouldn&rsquo;t have called Muhammad Ali an Irishman either.<br>
Abe Grady relinquished his white birthright by choosing a black woman to bear his children. Remember what they say  &mdash;  once you go black, you can never go back.   </p>

<p>Pathetic.  The Irish have such an inferiority complex that they must latch onto the famous with the remotest dribble of Irish blood.</p>
<p>The reason this is happening now is because - of course, by announcing that an African American, and a famous one, is Irish, the Irish are further conditioned to accept many, many other Blacks becoming Irish as well.</p>
<p>I have seen plenty of evidence that the miscegenation is well under way.</p>
<p>They too, will realize all too late that they have lost their Irish indentity in Ireland, and there is nowhere left to go.</p>

<p>Actually, Paddy is short for a different and once popular Irish name - Padraig.  There is a female version - Padraigeen.  The offensive angle comes from the years of oppression in NYC where the police began to call all Irish males, &#8220;Paddy,&#8221; and came to term the coaches used in mass arrests, &#8220;Paddy Wagons,&#8221; a term that is still in use.</p>
<p>But &#8220;Mick&#8221; is also a common name turned pejoritive by its historical, negative use.  This use is similar to the way &#8220;Anglo&#8221; is being used by Hispanics and others to denigrate whites as if we all look the same, come from the same one tribe, etc.  WASP is another pejorative term for whites; after all, what term for an ethnic groups is nastier than that?</p>
<p>As fore &#8220;Muhammed Ali&#8221; in Ireland claiming to be Irish, this is just a ploy to further sucker the Irish into compliance as they populate the Island with more Somalis, Nigerians, and Muslims.</p>

<p>Perfectly correct!  In view of the present worldwide anti-white political climate, we very much need to keep on emphasising and re-emphasising this fact without let up.</p>
<p>A cross between persons of African ethnicity and heritage and persons of white European ethnicity and heritage, is a Mulatto or Sambo. In fact, they&rsquo;re both separate ethnicities altogether.  Neither black nor white.</p>
<p><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Sambo" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Sambo</a></p>
<p>Sambo  (1)</p>
<p>&#8220;person of mixed blood in America and Asia,&#8221; 1748, perhaps from Sp. zambo &#8220;bandy-legged,&#8221; probably from L. scambus &#8220;bow-legged,&#8221; from Gk. skambos. Used variously in different regions to indicate some mixture of African, European, and Indian blood; common senses were &#8220;child of black and Indian parentage&#8221; and &#8220;offspring of a black and a mulatto.&#8221;<br>

<p>I agree.  South Africa, inheritor of the British Empire&rsquo;s old outlook on these things, still retains a third category   &mdash;   &#8220;Coloured&#8221;.  </p>
<p>As I understand it, the British Caribbean once had the same third category (still does?).  This was a much more realistic racial division than the rigid  &#8220;either/or&#8221;  position of the United States, where you&rsquo;re either all or nothing. The British system allowed for a third classification to accommodate mixed persons and eliminate this confusion.</p>
<p>Of course, the Caribbean and So. Africa had many more mulattoes to deal with than we did.  At that time!  But now we&rsquo;re dealing with them anyway, aren&rsquo;t we!  Just ask Messrs. Obama and Holder who are going to see to it that we do.</p>

		<p>    I remember watching Ali in the late sixties ( I remember when he beat Liston unexpectedly) and it was somewhat disconcerting to see a man so large move so fast and with such agility . I was definitely glad I was not in the ring opposing him . But he opted out of the military draft and the Vietnam War when he wouldn&rsquo;t have had to carry an M-16 into the jungle anyway . An option my 20 year old cousin did not have, he died there toting an M-16, drafted at 19 . For that I can never fully absolve the feeling that Ali still owes the country something, I try to forgive but it is not easy . Jerry Quarry is my choice of champions, he was overshawdowed by titans like Ali, Liston and Foreman and a media biased to them because they were of the PC etnicity . And Jerry was of European descent, in other words a brother . He looked like me and his ancestors were from the same part of the world my ancestors were from.  </p>

		<p>This is ridiculous.  Whites have recessive traits.  Blacks have dominant.  Mix the two, the child is black, and not white.  It&rsquo;s like a drop of milk in coffee.  The coffee may be a bit lighter, but it&rsquo;s still coffee. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m mostly Irish descent. My father used to use the term &#8220;Mick&#8221; to describe Irish Catholics and their descendents all over the world. An affectionate term as in, &#8216;We&rsquo;re a lot of Micks&rsquo;, to describe people like ourselves.<br>
Paddy Wagon is used very widely here in Aust. So widely that not many people would know the origin of the term.<br>
As an aside, that Johnny Rotten fellow&rsquo;s autobiography was entitled: &#8216;No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs&rsquo;, a commonly seen sign on British motels a while ago.<br>
Notice who&rsquo;s first on the list.</p>
<p>&hellip;&rdquo;and wished he&rsquo;d known then that &ldquo;The Greatest&rdquo; was &ldquo;just a Paddy like us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only one bloke saying that - and he&rsquo;s just crawling. Every Irish person I&rsquo;ve ever known has been dead-set against any sort of third-worlders in Ireland. My Irish mate says flat out that Irish people do not like blacks or want them in their country. But like any other white country, their glorious leaders will push the diversity angle and there will be leftists denouncing people that dare to object as &#8220;-insert term here-&#8220;</p>
