<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/health/policy/24grady.html">Immigrants Cling to Fragile Lifeline at Safety-Net Hospital </a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Sack, New York Times, Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At Grady [Hospital in Atlanta], about four in 10 patients are uninsured, and an additional 25 percent are insured by Medicaid, which reimburses at rates so low they often do not cover actual costs. As a result, the hospital lost $33.5 million last year, with the dialysis clinic accounting for about $2 million of that total, said Denise R. Williams, the hospital&rsquo;s executive vice president.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hospital officials estimate that two-thirds of the outpatient clinic&rsquo;s roughly 90 patients are illegal immigrants. They do not qualify for Medicare, which covers dialysis regardless of a patient&rsquo;s age, and they are excluded in Georgia from Medicaid and other government insurance programs. Legal immigrants face a five-year waiting period before becoming eligible. That leaves Grady to absorb costs of up to $50,000 a year per dialysis patient, some of whom have availed themselves of the thrice-weekly treatments for years.<br>

		<p>When you look at the government roles for the 400,000 patients receiving hemodialysis here in the US you would be astounded at how many were born in Mexico. An estimated 5% were born in Mexico<br>
giving a total of 20,000 patients receiving dialysis at $50,000<br>
a year.</p>

		<p>Not sure why we keep allowing these illegals to suck the blood and fabric out of our nation.  Seems we have some race based politics who think illegals are going to be voting soon. </p>
<p>It is anti-American to take away from Americans to give to criminals who have entered this country illegally, and due to their circumstances created by this, they continue on a pattern of crime.  All of us are effected by this, but our government is blind or stupid not sure!<br>
Pennsylvania made a critical mistake by not voting for the good mayor(Barletta)sp. who had the foresight to see that these criminals are demanding everything that our fore fathers have fought for. They want everything for free, and then want to take our jobs and send the money home.  How does this at help us????<br>
It is not about race, it is about the survival of our country, no other country allows illegals to come in and have babies, then have the government support the whole family.  This is support even Americans who need it can not get.  <br>
Vote all those dead heads out of congress who continually support illegals, or else we will all become a third world country, each year we get closer to it! Pervasiveness lawlessness and corruption are the critical signs!!!!!!! </p>
