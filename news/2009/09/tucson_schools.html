			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Doug MacEachern, Arizona Republic, Sept. 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It has been a busy summer for our friends running the Tucson Unified School District.</p>
<p>As always, the annual Institute for Transformative Education summer seminar, hosted by TUSD&rsquo;s amply funded Mexican/American raza-studies program, was fun. So much racial bitterness to obsess over. </p>
<p>Tim Wise, the ultra-angry Tulane University poli-sci grad who has made a great living finding racism under every doormat, was the featured speaker. Everyone was wowed. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>But, as always, TUSD&rsquo;s race-obsessing board of governors is taking racial bean-counting to preposterous extremes.</p>
<p>This summer, the TUSD board adopted a &#8220;Post-Unitary Status Plan&#8221; that it expects will help the district escape a decades-old federal desegregation order.</p>
<p>The plan includes increasing the number of minority teachers  &mdash;  per the summer hiring spree, which netted 14 special-education teachers and one math-science teacher. </p>
<p>It also includes a vast expansion of the district&rsquo;s controversial Mexican-American studies program. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The board&rsquo;s plan also calls for changes intended (however counterproductive those plans may be) to improving the lot of minority students. </p>
<p>It wants to see more minority students enrolled in advanced-placement programs, for example  &mdash;  a laudable goal, certainly. But consider one significant part of the plan for &#8220;improving&#8221; the academic status of TUSD&rsquo;s Black and Hispanic students:</p>
<p>The board is calling for a two-tiered form of student discipline. One for Black and Hispanic students; one for everyone else.</p>
<p>With the goal of creating a &#8220;restorative school culture and climate&#8221; that conveys a &#8220;sense of belonging to all students,&#8221; the board is insisting that its schools reduce its suspensions and/or expulsions of minority students to the point that the data reflect &#8220;no ethnic/racial disparities.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the section of the 52-page plan titled &#8220;Restorative School Culture and Climate,&#8221; subhead, &#8220;Discipline&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;School data that show disparities in suspension/expulsion rates will be examined in detail for root causes. Special attention will be dedicated to data regarding African-American and Hispanic students.&#8221;</p>
<p>The board approved creating an &#8220;Equity Team&#8221; that will oversee the plan to ensure &#8220;a commitment to social justice for all students.&#8221;</p>
<p>The happy-face edu-speak notwithstanding, what the Tucson Unified School District board of governors has approved this summer is a race-based system of discipline. </p>
<p>Offenses by students will be judged, and penalties meted out, depending on the student&rsquo;s hue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>We really need to begin having a mass dialogue among ourselves to begin deciding what we who are of European extraction intend to do about our future.  Until we have our own mass media this is unlikely to happen.  I would love to see Amren and other associated organizations reprsenting racially conscious European peoples work together to create a media addressing issues of concern to us.  I&rsquo;m surprised something has yet to be brought into being of the sort I just described.  Take a look at the BNP (British National Party) media.    </p>

Apparently, the way to get more minorities into advanced classes is to cut down on the number of suspensions.</p>
<p>These people can&rsquo;t understand that kids get into advanced placements because they have high grades. These people believe that putting average or below average kids in advanced classes makes kids smarter.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Dave Berry, &#8216;you can&rsquo;t make this stuff up&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>This kind of arrangement is in terrorist and long time Obama backer and friend Bill Ayers books on education.  Tim Wise, &#8220;exterminate Whitey&#8221; whose operation is run out of the Holocaust and Tolerance Museum in West Los Angeles was the consultant who helped the school district arrange this.</p>
<p>Basically it means the black and brown kids can now rape, assault, rob and beat the White teachers and students with total impunity.  I have always thought that was the real intention of school busing. Train us when young not to resist.</p>
<p>Hopefully the Whites will just desert Tucson school district and the blacks and browns can just fight each other and terrorize their affirmative action black and brown teachers.</p>

		<p>As minorities move towards majority status in the United States, they will be forced to attempt to implement strategies like the Post Unitary Status Plan to circumvent US law that&rsquo;s been on the books for over 40 years to their benefit. Our equal protection laws and affirmative action laws will soon benefit caucasions, and that&rsquo;s something that minorities will target for circumvention or extinction.</p>
<p>It is not fair to lump all minorities together, either. Relative to TUSD, we are primarily talking about Hispanics. Withing the minority sub-group of Hispanics, there are people who are not loyal to the United States. Those are the people we&rsquo;re talking about here - not ALL Hispanics. They believe that most of the southwestern United States rightly belongs to Mexico, and through the expansion of the La Raza studies within the TUSD, they&rsquo;re endoctrinating a new generation of both legal and illegal students to a militant attitude that that portion of the United States will eventually be returned to Mexico&rsquo;s governance whether peacably or through the use of force.</p>
<p> Right now, they are using our tax dollars to undermine our own state and our country as a whole. Someone far wiser than myself will figure out a way to serve a cease and desist order on the district based on concepts such as &#8216;hate-speech&rsquo; and the content of both their classes and summer seminars; or, in the case of firing and hiring new teachers over the summer, maybe reverse discrimination.</p>
<p>The trend within the TUSD is  is facilitated by anti-American insurgents. To use the (very) tired divisive Liberal vs. Conservative argument only weakens our position as Americans. The people who are spearheading this movement within TUSD are counting on the fact that conservatives and liberals are in such a political deadlock that the in-fighting will obscure their own political directives that are facilitated by La Raza studies and race-based discipline programs.</p>

		<p>TUSD is completely out-of-control and needs to be reigned in by the State. If black and latino students are commiting offenses that warrant discipline, the focus on the school ought to be on determining why that is rather than watering down its system of punishment to make sure that the number of students punished isn&rsquo;t &#8220;raciall disproportionate&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a minor, but necessary step, in bringing TUSD back to sanity, the voters of the city of Tucson should reject TUSD&rsquo;s budget override ballot initatives. Maybe if TUSD is starved of funding, it will be forced to return to its fundamental job of educating children rather than dabbling in race-based social engineering.<br>

		<p>If your child attends a TUSD government school, my only questions is: &#8220;WHY?&#8221; Why would you send your most precious gift to be controlled by these radical freaks. Pull your child out now before it is too late. Send them to a private school or home school them. The TUSD mission is not to educate, it is to indoctrinate. They are experimenting with social engineering. Give up that new car, fancy house, vacation and do something right for your children. Give them an education that will teach them HOW to think, not WHAT to think. <br>

		<p>The inmates are running the asylum. Of course, we&rsquo;re talking Tucson here, home of the liberals sucking off of the public dole. THE major private employer - Ratheon. Everyone else works for the university, the county, the city, a Fed job (Fed courthouse, DEA, Border Patrol, FBI, Davis-Monthan AFB, etc.) or they&rsquo;re retired and living on a government pension or schlepping tables. This is the result of what happens when libs take over a city.<br>

They are only codifying what has been standard practice for a long time. I taught 8th grade 32 years in central phoenix and witnessed the selective discipline of students for over a decade. When I reported rumors that two particular boys were molesting girls my principal (female) told me &#8220;you need to be more tolerant of cultural differences&#8221;. </p>
<p>When a nerdy boy scout forgot to leave his Swiss Army knife at home, I took it, called his mother and asked her to come and pick it up from me. She asked why she couldn&rsquo;t pick it up from the office. I explained that if the office got involved her son would become a statistic. He would be suspended or expelled on a weapons charge so that the district could say &#8220;see, we do discipline white kids for weapons&#8221;. I could go on and on with more anecdotalse. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that over the past two decades black and Hispanic students have somewhere learned they have an entitlement to race-based resentment. School administrators often find lawyers from civil-rights groups defending the most outrageous behavior. In such cases the pressure on teachers to abandon equal treatment is immense. It is especially hard on those of us who are older and have a well defined set of ethical and moral values. Many of the younger teachers and principals have been taught in university that this kind of thinking is correct!<br>

		<p>Some behavior will be met with strict penalties; some will not. It all depends on the color of the student&rsquo;s skin. <br>
So does a dark skinned Black receive a different level of discipline then a light skinned Black?</p>
<p>And what about Albinos? Do they merit special attention? </p>

		<p>I was reading about this yesterday in the Tucson paper. As near as I can tell, this is a Bill Ayers education policy special. That said, it seems to me this plan is designed to permit minority students to spend less time in school, therefore encouraging them to acquire less knowledge and skills, such as math, and to enjoy lower GPAs, than the non-minority students; in effect, a plan for keeping an ample supply of maids, yard workers and other minimum wage toilers available in Tucson. </p>
<p>At the same time, the strict standards set for the non-minority students would encourage them to learn more, raise their GPAs, get into college, and live the American dream. I don&rsquo;t think the &ldquo;educators&rdquo; bothered to think this through to its logical conclusion.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s illegal and unconstitutional to do this, but apparently the race hucksters complained about the &ldquo;disproportionate&rdquo; number of minority people being disciplined, that they decided to give them an easier time and discipline more of the people who don&rsquo;t commit crimes.</p>

		<p>They proposed something like this in upstate NY and some of those DC suburban Maryland school districts are doing it already, so my guess is some race-huckster organization is rolling this out country wide. Make no mistake, you start with this nonsense in the schools, and eventually a 2 tier justice system shows up at your local police department and prison.</p>

		<p>Maricopa County has the same thing for people convicted of DUI. Indians and Spanish speakers can be diverted into a special program for minorities which results in far lighter sentences than for those not minorities. Andrew Thomas sued but it was tossed for lack of standing.</p>
<p>I wonder when the hispanic legal assistance groups funded by the federal government will go after MADD for proposing drunk driving laws that &#8220;disproportionately impact&#8221; drunk Mexicans and Indians.</p>

		<p>I briefly skimmed the TUSD document referenced here and the disciplinary policy section of same. I just can&rsquo;t wrap my mind around the notion that in this country there literally exists an entire &#8220;industry&#8221; that is dedicated to the edjukashun and training of people to &#8220;study&#8221;, craft, draft, administer, and deliver all of this edjukrat tripe. And I can&rsquo;t comprehend how any of it&rsquo;s particpants from professors in university schools of edjukashun to principals, to guidance counselors, to skool kops (I refuse to call them school resource officers), to teachers, and coaches can look themselves in the face every morning in the mirror and also avoid a compulsion to take three or four baths a day.</p>

		<p>I see the error of my ways. LBJ told us that we must have not only equality of opportunity, but we must have equality of results. This was followed by the Supreme Court case of Griggs v. Duke Power (a discussion here: Tiny URL: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/llkztz" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/llkztz</a>  )<br>
Griggs created the pernicious concept of &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; which has bedeviled the country for the past almost forty years. The New Haven firefighters case seems to have tempered the problem a bit, but the racial quotas, under the  name of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; will live on for many years. By the way, Griggs was decided by at least eight mushy headed justices!<br>
This decision of the Tucson schools is based on the disparate impact concept and might make an interesting new legal case.<br>

		<p>On reading the article it also sounds as if punishment will be reviewed in this light, which I read as a sort of threat to those who have decided that any particular student needs punishment/discipline. Another thought&hellip;this will foment ill will between the children, cause them to see themselves in terms of groups and offend their sense of fairness. Kids pick up very quickly on this sort of treatment. And it sets up the minorities to have a warped view of how the real world will react to them.</p>

		<p>This kind of thing has been standard in China since the communist conquest 60 years ago.  Set up stringent rules such our schools zero tolerance rules.  Then selectively enforce the rules against your enemies until they are destroyed but let your friends violate the rules with total impunity.</p>
<p>Straight out of Mao&rsquo;s little red handbook, the Lenin Stalin era in Russia and Bill Ayers theories.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly why this merits an article in the paper.  Schools all over the country have been doing this since about 1955.  Let the blacks get away with anything but discipline the Whites.</p>

		<p>I can only hope that there will be one White parent who will have the guts to file a civil rights lawsuit when he is punished differently that a black kid who did the same thing. It is obvious that the black and hispanic kids are comitting the most serious misbehavior and it is only fitting that they have the most severe punishment. It almost sounds like they will probably start suspending White kids for chewing gum and littering after the quota of black suspensions has been reached. </p>

		<p>It is racist to expect blacks and Hispanics to adhere to standards whites have set for themselves and their cultures.</p>
<p>No one expects the African Space Program or Mexican medical programs to lead the world in science and research. Neither should we expect the offspring of those cultures to behave any differently in the US.</p>
<p>So, we need to lower expectations accordingly, and laws and customs regarding behavior and achievement should have a lowered standard for those incapable of meeting existing standards.</p>

		<p>America has become Geroge Orwell&rsquo;s Animal Farm.  The blacks and hispanics are Napoleon the pig who has all the privileges and does no work.  Whites are Boxer, the horse who does all the work and gets nothing.</p>
<p>But in Animal Farm USA 2010,  more sinister figures will emerge, probably Tim Weasel aka Tim Wise and Angry Fox aka Abe Foxman.  They  will send the wolves to kill Boxer and the steadfast workers after convicting them of evil thought.</p>

		<p>I read the actual guidelines. Of course, regardless of the actions of students of color, there must be an equal percentage of whites, hispanics, and blacks suspended or disciplined. So will the school district institute expulsion from school for 2 lateness episodes for whites per year, while students of color will be expelled only if they murder another student? Or maybe they can increase the numbers of whites disciplined by, at random choosing whites who haven&rsquo;t broken any rules and suspend them for several weeks. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been teaching in TUSD for ten years, and this is the most ridiculous thing I&rsquo;ve heard. This is TUCSON, the hispanic population is not just in the majority in most schools, in some schools it is just shy of ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of the student body. </p>
<p>Advanced Placement classes are for college credit, and there is indeed a large proportion of white students in them, followed by Hispanic, and almost no black, but that&rsquo;s not because of some insidious institutionalized racism, that&rsquo;s just mother nature taking it&rsquo;s course. We already have a large percentage of Hispanic teachers because Spanish is needed for students for whom English is a second language, and they could hardly be called racist against their own students.</p>
<p>There is an upside to having teachers of Mexican extraction, they can speak their mind when their students misbehave and some of them do. I once heard one tell a student to &#8220;quit fooling around and acting like a lazy Mexican&#8221;. Put a smile on my face.</p>

		<p>The solution is simple:  assign each  black or hispanic student a &#8220;whipping boy&#8221; (or girl).  Whenever a black or hispanic student commits an infraction the white pupil assigned as their &#8220;whipping boy&#8221; would be punished.   The school district could then honestly report a greater incidence of white disciplinary actions.</p>

		<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t work, they could always look for extra whites to single out for punishment to make sure the stats even out.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m being facetious, the Soviets actually did this kind of thing under Stalin. During the horrific purges of the 1930s, death quotas were established for various districts and the KGB was expected to fill them. Innocent persons were rounded up and killed simply to fill these quotas, as happened at the little-known mass grave of Kurapaty (now in Belarus) between 1937 and 1941.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either implement this latter approach, or allow large numbers of black and &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; delinquents to roam the premises, creating mayhem at will, which will result in even more white students being withdrawn and either home schooled, privately schooled or moved elsewhere.</p>

		<p>Why are we surprised that Tim Wise (I know, his surname is quite ironic) was the main speaker? For someone who claims that this is such an oppressive, racist, and fascist nation, he sure enjoys plenty of freedoms. Were he a pro-Uighur activist in China, he would be beaten and imprisoned before he could enjoy the opportunity to travel to numerous campuses and indoctrinate vulnerable Han Chinese people with his self-hating rhetoric. I know, he would probably respond by claiming that I am another typical, ignorant white person who misunderstands him. Of course he is patriotic, despite having fantasies about causing peoples&rsquo; heads to explode during the 4th of July, which he believes is just due to their pride in the United States, which of course is born of hubris. Of course he doesn&rsquo;t hate whites, despite asserting that the N word is the first word that comes to a white person&rsquo;s mind when he/she sees a black person being arrested. Of course he doesn&rsquo;t hate whites, despite pointing out every conceivable flaw in White society. If we really are such an awful nation, I say we live up to his expectations by denying him his basic freedoms. Better yet, send him to live in some totalitarian nation. By the time he&rsquo;s through, he&rsquo;ll thank the universe for white/European civilization.</p>

		<p>Would the qoutas have to be met at the end of every month like police departments and traffic citations? If so would discipline increase among white students toward the end of each month? Would a minority student be socially rewarded by the faculty for antagonizing a white student if he/she can draw out a punishable response? It would stand to reason that as lesser and lesser offenses by white students required an ever increasing level of punishment to keep the statistics equal, white students would become more and more disciplined, docile, and submissive(especially toward the end of the month). On the other hand, minorities who engage in antagonistic behavior and outright attacks will gain an elevated status both as individuals and as a group from the faculty who are trying to keep their jobs. Minorities who are essentially good kids will form their own group with crossover essentially going from the good kids group to the bad kids group for those who want to join in on the fun.</p>

<p>Ice:</p>
<p>It has been my experience that the school districts&rsquo; notion of cutting &#8216;frivolities&rsquo; includes honors and AP classes, field trips, enrichment materials and guest speakers for advanced students, art, technology and music programs  &mdash;  anything that may benefit better, more advanced students to the right of the Bell Curve (that would be Whites and Asians).</p>
<p>ANY program that benefits NAMs (non-Asian minorities) are never ever EVER cut or even touched, in fact I&rsquo;ve noticed that even during times of &#8216;drastic cuts&rsquo; to the schools, the funding for these programs is often increased  &mdash;  school based &#8216;free&rsquo; health services, outreach programs for NAM students AND their parents, cross town busing to achieve &#8216;racial parity&rsquo;, special race-based textbooks and programs, special high-priced race-based counselors and psychologists, special, extremely expensive tutoring and Kaplan programs for &#8216;college bound&rsquo; NAMs, well you get the point.</p>
<p>Whites need to get their kids out of mainstream government school  &mdash;  and vote in a bloc against any school bonds that go to a system that scorns your values and treats your White children like garbage.  This goes for Asians as well.</p>

<p>Yeah, so typical.  </p>
<p>Some of these cuts are targeted at popular programs such as sports, honors, AP and band on purpose  &mdash;  cuts aimed specifically at programs Whites enjoy  &mdash;   to get White homeowners to pass yet another parcel tax or school bond.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, I well understand homeowners balking at one more levy on their property  &mdash;  especially taxpayers in such places as  California who are forced to pay for schools their children cannot attend because they&rsquo;ve been ruined by illegal aliens and ayers-trained educators.</p>
<p>In California, &#8220;&hellip;prior to 2001, districts needed two-thirds approval to pass local general obligation bond measures. More than 40% of local school bond ballot questions failed. In November 2000, California voters passed Proposition 39. Proposition 39 reduced the supermajority needed to pass a bond issue ballot question from 67% to 55%.  80% of local school bond ballots that rely on the 55% approval have succeeded&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>These bonds are passed easily now by a non-White voting bloc that does not own homes and have little understanding as to how the bond process works. </p>
<p>As for the schools in LA  &mdash;  there is not enough fiat dollars in the entire US to satisfy the hungry maw of its unionized work force. They can pretend all they want that they&rsquo;re trying to &#8216;educate&rsquo; children, but the reality is, it&rsquo;s a huge job mill for non-Whites.</p>
