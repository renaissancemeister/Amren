<h1><a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Kincaid/cliff355.htm">Scandal: Fox News Hires Apologist for Cop-Killer</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cliff Kincaid, News with Views, September 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The &#8220;conservative&#8221; Fox News Channel (FNC) has hired Marc Lamont Hill, a public supporter of convicted cop-killer Assata Shakur, as a paid &#8220;analyst&#8221; and &#8220;contributor.&#8221; He has appeared on &#8220;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor,&#8221; hosted by Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, more often than other FNC programs.</p>
<p>A member of the Black Liberation Army (BLA), a group that worked with the communist terrorist Weather Underground, Assata Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, killed New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster &#8220;execution style&#8221; by shooting him in the head as he lay wounded by gunfire, according to the State Troopers Association of New Jersey. She was convicted of murder and went to prison but escaped to Cuba.</p>
<p>The Officer Down Memorial Page features a page in honor of Foerster. He was only 34 years old when he was killed. The killer is still &#8220;at large,&#8221; being protected by Communist Cuba.</p>
<p>The decision to feature Hill as a paid FNC commentator has infuriated supporters of the police and law enforcement.</p>
<p>Hill, a fast-talking commentator, is described on his own website as someone who specializes in hip-hop culture and &#8220;started a literacy project that uses hip-hop culture to increase school engagement and reading skills among high school students.&#8221; It also says that he works with the ACLU Drug Reform Project, &#8220;focusing on drug informant policy.&#8221; The ACLU favors legalization of all drugs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a commentator on issues that go far beyond his expertise on hip-hop culture, Hill was recently on the Greta Van Susteren Fox News Channel show defending Obama&rsquo;s ousted green jobs czar, Van Jones, a communist who also had a record of anti-police agitation. Hill said, &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&rsquo;s so disappointing that the Obama administration didn&rsquo;t fight for Van Jones. They put him up there. They hired the guy. And then throw him under the bus when it&rsquo;s politically expedient. It&rsquo;s very disappointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, an article on his web page, which appears under Hill&rsquo;s by-line and photo, declares that Shakur, who is still on the FBI&rsquo;s Most Wanted List, is &#8220;one of the great heroes in the Black Freedom Struggle&#8221; and proclaims, &#8220;Mother Assata: I am eternally grateful for your life and example. I give thanks to the ancestors for you. I pray for your continued protection and pledge to support you and our people until I die. In Beautiful Struggle, Marc.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He emphasized that he doesn&rsquo;t support a cop-killer. &#8220;If I thought that she had done it, I would not support her,&#8221; he said. That goes without saying. Who in their right mind would support a convicted cop-killer?</p>
<p>However, the FBI is currently offering a reward of up to $1,000,000 for information directly leading to the apprehension of Shakur. This didn&rsquo;t stop Hill from supporting her.</p>
<p>Convicted in the 1973 murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster, she escaped from prison in 1979 with the help of members of the communist terrorist Weather Underground and Black Liberation Army and eventually fled to Cuba, where she received political asylum from the Castro government.</p>
<p>While Hill disputed reports that Shakur shot Foerster in the head, the website of America&rsquo;s Most Wanted, a Fox program, describes what happened this way: &#8220;On May 2, 1973, New Jersey State Police Troopers James Harper and Werner Foerster were patrolling the New Jersey Turnpike in the East Brunswick area. They stopped a car with three occupants and began to question them. The female passenger, JoAnne Chesimard, was a member of the Black Liberation Army. She suddenly pulled out a semi-automatic pistol and opened fire. Trooper Foerster was struck twice in the chest and Trooper Harper was hit in the shoulder. Chesimard then picked up Trooper Foerster&rsquo;s service weapon and shot him twice in the head, execution style, while he lay in the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attack on Foerster also took the life in the gun battle of Shakur&rsquo;s associate, Zayd Shakur. Former Weather Underground terrorist leaders Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn named one of their children after Zayd Shakur, who now goes under the name of &#8220;Zayd Dohrn&#8221; and is a playwright today.</p>
<p>Hill, described as &#8220;one of the leading hip-hop generation intellectuals in the country,&#8221; appears regularly on programs such as &#8220;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor,&#8221; &#8220;Huckabee,&#8221; and &#8220;Hannity,&#8221; according to his website. He is on the faculty of Columbia University as Associate Professor of Education at Teachers College.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alluding to the involvement of other terrorists in getting Shakur out of prison after her murder conviction, the article on Hill&rsquo;s website which appears under his photo and by-line says that &#8220;Fortunately, with the help of her comrades and the ancestors, Assata was able to escape the belly of the beast in 1979 and emerge safely in Cuba, where she&rsquo;s been granted protection as a political prisoner. Despite the relentless efforts of the federal and state government, she remains safe in one of the last remaining palenques on Earth.&#8221; Palenque is said to be a term for a runaway location where Africans can take refuge.</p>
<p>But when asked about the comments, Hill repeated that &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t write that&#8221; and &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t post that.&#8221; He said he only supports people not being held in prison who are innocent. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t support violence or terrorism of any sort,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t surprise me.  Real conservatism is practically illegal amongst all large corporation, news agencies, government agencies and educational institutions.  Fox is too big to be conservative.  Instead, it&rsquo;s fake conservative and appears to only exist to soften accusations of a one-sided American media.  Of course I don&rsquo;t watch T.V. so my theory is that of an outsider looking in.</p>

		<p>I think Murdoch and the FNC suits are trying to live down their reputation as a slightly conservative channel.  But it doesn&rsquo;t matter   &mdash;   no matter how much you pander, the libkooks will hate you anyway.  The more you pander, the more they hate you.</p>
<p>Why change?  Usually, the top five or six shows in the evening gabfest competition are usually all FNC.  Only lamestream conservatism and the political party it represents would want to snatch failure from the jaws of success.</p>

		<p>I remember Bill questioning him on his show. He gave the fact that white Americans don&rsquo;t pay as much as they should to educate the inner city kids as an excuse for blacks to be angry at cops. Bill did not state that inner city schools get about four times more money than white schools. Be ready for the fox people to not dispute what he says. They don&rsquo;t want to be racist. </p>

		<p>One Million dollars is a huge incentive to bring her to justice. When travel restrictions to Cuba ease for Americans, bounty hunters on vacation will track down Chesimard and spirit her out of that communist hellhole. There will be no place to hide. She will pay for her crimes.</p>

		<p>Yes, we can thank O&rsquo;Reilly for this demon.  O&rsquo;Reilly is behind a lot that goes on at Fox News, whether it&rsquo;s personnel or policy.</p>
<p>It was O&rsquo;reilly who INSISTED that EVERYBODY on Fox report the tea party crowd in D.C. on 9/12 as being only 75,000 people.  Anybody can compare the photos to other similar events in the same location and see that there were WELL OVER a million people there.  Many experts verified that also, with one Illinois University professor estimating 1.7 million people.</p>
<p>People from Fox, who came on The Factor, would slip up and say that &#8220;over a million&#8221; people attended, and O&rsquo;Reilly would be quick to correct them and say 75,000 were there, because the Fire Marshall said so.  (Somebody who was in D.C. said the Fire Marshal&rsquo;s office made an estimate before the main influx of people arrived.  </p>
<p>But, in any event, as I mentionned above, all anybody needs to do is compare the photos.  They tell the story.  I think the turn out was absolutely amazing.  I hope the pressure by these people continue, because if more than a million traveled to a city that was far from their homes, there has to be at least millions more who couldn&rsquo;t make the trip. </p>
<p>But the Fire Marshall was saying about 75,000 people, so O&rsquo;Reilly went with that, I&rsquo;m pretty sure, because he doesn&rsquo;t want to be seen as favoring the tea party crowd, which would draw condemnation from the far left.  O&rsquo;Reilly I&rsquo;m pretty sure wants to be accepted by the left as a serious interviewer.</p>
<p>He also uses the SPLC whenever he needs a supporting &#8220;expert&#8221; on groups around the country, which is absolutely disgusting.  The SPLC just loves him.</p>
<p>This Hill is an apologist for every black, left wing radical that comes up.  He&rsquo;s a Black Studies PHD, and he has memorized facts and figures, plus quite a bit of other data concerning everything about the urban areas and the blacks that live in them.  He hasn&rsquo;t said so, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s a communist.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s reason for having him on is the same reason he frequently chooses black &#8220;experts&#8221; whenever he looks for someone to give an opinion on an issue, and the same reason he claims the tea party crowd amounted to just 75,000 people, which is, as I mentioned above, because he wants to be accepted by the left as an unbiased interviewer.  </p>
<p>When Hillary finally came in for an interview, because she needed the conservative Democrats against Obama, during the primaries, O&rsquo;Reilly acted like a little kid with an unlimited gift certificate in an ice cream store afterwards. It was embarassing to watch him gush.  Frankly, the interview was really boring.</p>
<p>Now, he wants to get the Messiah in, so he&rsquo;s very careful to avoid criticizing him unless he absolutely has to do so in order to retain a bit of credibility, but, even then, he&rsquo;s a bit guarded.  </p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned about O&rsquo;Reilly is that he does help in SOME areas of social conservatism, but his desire to be accepted by the left isn&rsquo;t going to happen, so he&rsquo;d be better off by forgetting about appeasing the lefties.  They hate anybody that tries to be &#8220;fair and balanced.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Every time I&rsquo;m watching the O&rsquo;Reilly Factor and this guy comes on I change the channel.  He is the epitomy of affirmative action - a man with barely average intelligence who is promoted to the status of a college professor and &#8220;intellectual&#8221; because he happens to be black.</p>

		<p>Hill is another in a long list of examples of the failure of The Great Society. His &#8216;doctor&rsquo; status was no doubt obtained through affirmative action, and as worthless as his arguments.</p>
<p>He is certainly educated beyond his ability to understand. Of course, that perfectly describes most liberals.</p>
<p>The Obama apologist O&rsquo;Reilly should prove the &#8216;fair and balanced&rsquo; mantra without adding the lame-brain Hill to the mix.<br>

		<p>I saw this guy on O&rsquo;Reilly. I did not think much of him, and was especially perplexed when I saw he was a Ph. D.</p>
<p>I distrust anyone who talks as fast as this guy, and who bounces around as much. To me, that IS NOT the characteristic of an educated mind. Even the way he smiles is smarmy.</p>
<p>To O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s credit, he, in an almost casual way, slammed this guy many times.</p>
<p>As with most black &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; this guy is just a lightweight who talks fast, without consideration or any semblance of deep thought. </p>

<p>I used to find it a bit odd that it was Fox News being portrayed as biased, but I have to pretty much agree with Jewamongyou. I think I&rsquo;ve always suspected that to be true, so it doesn&rsquo;t bother me much when Fox is portrayed as the devil by the right-thinking crowd. <br>

		<p>All one has to do is read the book by Ex-FBI agent Danny Coulson <br>
No Heros He tells the whole shocking story of the Black Liberation Army How they snuck up behind police officers in the NY&NJ; area and shot them. The BLA also robbed banks as means to finance their terrorist actions. JoAnne Chesimand was a key member of that gang. Chesimand may have been involved in other killings as well. After 35 years these snakes and their apologists are still raising their ugly heads and spiting venom. Shame on Fox news for putting them on the air. Fox news has reached a new low in reporting.  <br>

		<p>Rules for all whites, conservatives and libertarians out there:<br>
1. Don&rsquo;t surrender your beliefs or compromise with liberals or non-whites.<br>
2. Don&rsquo;t be defensive.<br>
3. You must outrage the enemy. Nothing too extreme can be said about liberals or non-whites. So be vicious.<br>
4. Never apologize for your beliefs. And especially never apologize to a liberal or a non-white.<br>
5. Never compliment a liberal or a non-white. Your compliments are always returned with insults.<br>
6. Never show graciousness or kindness to a liberal or a non-white. It won&rsquo;t be returned and will probably be used against you.<br>
7. Never flatter a liberal or non-white.<br>
8. Do not succumb to liberal or non-white bribery.<br>
9. As a white person, conservative or libertarian prepare for your deepest darkest secrets to become known. If they can&rsquo;t find nothing they will make something up.<br>
10. Look for white liberals to convert to the right side.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Hill on television a number of times - he comes off as, well, pretty darn stupid and is actually an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. I&rsquo;m at a loss to figure out what he has to offer anyone with more than half a brain. He speaks in clipped sound-bites, mumbling leftist and anti-white nonsense. Any &#8220;professor&#8221; who proudly puts &#8220;hip-hop intellectual&#8221; on his calling card can&rsquo;t be much more intelligent than a 14 year old. </p>

		<p>I think this is okay.  Fox News tries to have as many lefties on their shows as they do from the middle and the right.  After all, they do use Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin, both of which are so far to the right of Professor Hill.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Murdock wants to screw around with his ratings.  They are beating every other news station.    I think Murdock thinks with dollar signs and not ideology like NBC, CBS and ABC do.</p>
<p>My husband asked why the news stations and newspapers would be so stupid when they are losing money.  My reply is that the guys that own these newspapers and tv stations, have already made their gazillion dollars and their ideology trumps everything else.  Do you think that Kate Couric would care if CBS suddenly started to turn to the middle and to the right.  If she were canned, she&rsquo;s already a gazillionaire.  So what would she care.</p>

		<p>Juan Williams is the only reputable black intellectual on O&rsquo;Reilly. He is a moderate, can argue his way out of a paper bag, and is a sensible person, unlike Hill, who is a rambling apologist for bad black behavior&hellip;fast talking is a poor substitute for intelligent, cogent, discourse. How did Hill even manage to get a PhD?&hellip; Hint: aff-action strikes again.</p>

		<p>To http://communistobama.wordpress.com: I can add one more thing to your list (which I doubt most White racialists will do, anyway, but it&rsquo;s worth mentioning).</p>
<p>11.  At least once a month, contact (by letter (not e-mail) AND by phone) one of your elected representatives and let them know your feelings (in a lucid, respectful manner, of course) on issues affecting Whites (eg. immigration issues).

		<p>I have had the misfortune of hearing this glassy eyed &#8220;intellectual&#8221; speak (and with less intelligence and authority than the average black NFL player) on numerous occasions. That he is touted as a PhD, speaks volumes about the sham that is Affirmative Action and the faulty scholarship inherent in the quota system. If his credentials are not fraudulent, then there is an even greater crime that&rsquo;s been committed here.  </p>

		<p>O&rsquo;Reilly doesn&rsquo;t run anything at Fox News. Fox News is merely the way it is a) to make people think there&rsquo;s a &#8220;conservative&#8221; counterpoint to the MSM and b) to present the anti-American, anti-white views of the neocons as legitimate conservative thinking that&rsquo;s good for America. </p>

<p>I mean, for starters, how can hip-hop, and intellectual, be put in the same  single sentence?</p>

		<p>&#8220;He emphasized that he doesn&rsquo;t support a cop-killer. &ldquo;If I thought that she had done it, I would not support her,&rdquo; he said. That goes without saying. Who in their right mind would support a convicted cop-killer?&#8221;</p>
<p>To the guy who writes the blurbs that describe the stories on the homepage, saying that Fox hired someone who supported a convicted cop-killer is misleading.  Literal but misleading, it is all of our responsibilities to combat legal injustice where we see it.  If this young man thinks the defendant was railroaded then he should support justice.</p>

		<p>So you&rsquo;re telling me the Communist Party will bust black criminals out of jail, smuggle them out of the country and then hide them away in Cuba?  That actually sounds pretty good to me.  Take &#8216;em, they&rsquo;re all yours!</p>

		<p>The woman has been proven to be a cop-killer, hence he supports a cop-killer. Hill supports any and all blacks who beat the anti-white drum. LOOK at his record. That anyone could defend this fraud is as silly and sad as Hill defending Shakur. </p>
