			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael J. Feeney and John Lauinger, New York Daily News, September 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A pair of security guards who were supposed to keep an eagle eye on the highly trafficked span were fired Monday after pictures of them repeatedly snoozing on the job were published on the Web site Cliffviewpilot.com.</p>
<p>The slumbering guards worked for FJC Security Services. The Manhattan-based company is contracted by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which controls the bridge  &mdash;  considered by law enforcement to be a key terror target.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two guards have been fired by the security contractor,&#8221; the Port Authority said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>The damning pictures of the dozing guards were snapped by Joey Lepore, who owns a bicycle tour company and rides over the bridge regularly.</p>
<p>He caught one of the guards catnapping inside a security booth twice yesterday morning. Lepore told Cliffviewpilot he was fed up because he had spotted a different guard conked out on Aug. 5.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that was the third time I&rsquo;d seen him sleeping!&#8221; Lepore told the Web site.</p>

		<p>Good idea   &mdash;   Show the world and Al Qaeda that many NYC landmarks are guarded by affirmative action employees.  You think somebody&rsquo;s getting some ideas over in Afghanistan? </p>
<p>The worse idea is to have affirmative action employees guarding NYC landmarks.  It&rsquo;s that kind of racial pandering that helped cause the first 9/11   &mdash;   airport screeners were too afraid of ACLU/CAIR to report sneaky behavior on the part of young Arab men.  Events like the Flying Imams scandal (which happened After 9/11) serves to whet people&rsquo;s fears.</p>

		<p>If I had to place a wager, I&rsquo;d bet the most popular private sector employment for black males in NYC and probably the world is private security/doormen/bouncers. I work in downtown Manhattan, and I&rsquo;d say 90 percent of the doormen/security peronel are black. </p>
<p>I mean it is the perfect job for them, they get to carry  weapons and can strut around like the proud African warriors that they are. Most of em, seem to quickly settle into a sleep like stupor kicking  their feet kicked back as they watch small flickering portable televisions. They assume a reptilian, semi conscious state until someone violates one of the rules at which point they hostilely bark irate ebonic gibberish at their hapless target.</p>
<p>For example the african noble warrior who guards my office building on the weekends still pretends he does not recognize me after seeing me for the past three years and grumbles some kind of sound, not really in any language, in my general direction when I don&rsquo;t sign his little click board, which is really just for delivery boys and couriers and whatnot but whatever. </p>

		<p>There is a web site called &#8220;Things that black people hate&#8221;. One of the things listed is &#8220;not sleeping on the job&#8221;. It shows pictures and news clips of black train drivers sleeping. Don&rsquo;t think this story is not common. </p>

		<p>    This is nothing unusual where I work. I am a lab technician employed by a state university. Two of my co-workers are black. Guess who spends a good part of the day napping? One of these shiftless parasites actually claims,&#8221;I don&rsquo;t need this job!&#8221; whenever something doesn&rsquo;t go his way, which is often. <br>
   Both of these shirkers are college educated. All they learned was how to milk the system. This campus is rife with many of the same ilk. Talk about a waste of tax dollars!?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re close.  It&rsquo;s called Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like (SBPDL)  &mdash;  a play on Stuff White People Like.  SBPDL is cynical, sarcastic, truthful and&hellip;. hilarious.  Definitely worth bookmarking.</p>
<p>The article is entitled  &#8220;#508. Staying Awake While Operating a Washington DC Metro Train&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Recently, a teen from Maryland caught a Black person - who was the conductor of the metro train - asleep at the wheel:<br>
&#8220;<br>
A 14-year-old Metro passenger captured stunning footage on the Green Line in Maryland. Gregory Thomas said he was riding the line June 18 and witnessed the train operator asleep at the controls&hellip;&rsquo;At first he&rsquo;s dozing off then, he&rsquo;s not in a full sleep. I see him start to doze off and his head going limp,&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the case of this DC Metro Train operator, it could possibly mean a fatal crash that could take the lives of everyone on board the train&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/mf9mmy" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/mf9mmy</a></p>
<p>The article didn&rsquo;t mention whether this particular driver was fired  &mdash;  I suspect not.  I wonder if the bridge operator has been re-instated after screaming racism or racial profiling. </p>

		<p>One of the weird ironies of modern American life is that &#8220;security guards&#8221; are almost always ex-cons.</p>
<p>Really though, would you rather have these two sleeping peacefully, or demanding elderly white people remove their shoes for inspection like their brother &#8220;security guards&#8221; do at the airport? </p>

		<p>Does anyone here ever remember those guards in Jabbas palace in the movie &#8220;Return of the Jedi&#8221;? Now I know where George Lucas got his idea for these vile creatures from. Heck I guess even Affirmative Action is being incorporated in the Outer Rim as well!</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>Jabba the Hutt was known to use dim-witted Gamorreans as enforcers and bodyguards. They can be best described closest to pigs with their mouths and grunting kind of language. They are stocky and muscular, making them excellent melee/hand to hand fighters.</p>
<p>I wouldnt say stocky and muscular though. More like &#8220;lazy and morbidly obese, making them excellent leeches of society.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is probably a job created for the sole purpose of paying blacks to do nothing. In some areas of Chicago (I&rsquo;ve seen it in the theater district, so its possibly occuring in other areas as well)blacks are paid to direct traffic, despite there being traffic signals at the intersections. </p>

		<p>A pair of affirmative action hires allegedly protecting us from terrorists  &mdash;  who themselves are only in this country because the immigration laws were changed in 1965. Naivety piled on top of naivety. What a great commentary on modern america.</p>

		<p>In fairness to the two hapless souls caught sleeping, they have non-jobs.  Does anybody think that a couple of guys with old S&W; .38s are really going to stop determined terrorists?  Or more to the point, that there really are determined terrorists trying to take down the GW bridge?</p>
<p>Right now these poor souls are sitting listlessly in every federal building in the US, every courthouse, every place a numb-skull federal bureaucrat with an over-active imagine can think a terrorist might want to attack. Of course the poor sods are bored silly. They could be replaced with uniformed and armed mannequins.</p>
