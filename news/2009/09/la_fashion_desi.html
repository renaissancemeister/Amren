<h1>LA Fashion Designer Gets 59 Years to Life Sentence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Risling, Yahoo! News, September 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fashion designer Anand Jon Alexander was sentenced Monday to 59 years to life in prison for sexually assaulting aspiring models he lured to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Alexander, 35, showed no reaction as Superior Court Judge David Wesley said Alexander should be incarcerated as long as possible for preying upon young girls and women. Alexander was convicted in November of 14 counts including forcible rape. He was found not guilty of four felonies, and jurors could not reach a verdict on three counts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The sentencing capped a tumultuous, exhausting post-verdict saga that included allegations of juror tampering by his sister, Sanjana, juror misconduct and Alexander&rsquo;s decision to represent himself. Alexander also lost a bid for a new trial earlier Monday, claiming there was a conspiracy among law enforcement to convict him.</p>
<p>The most striking image came as a bevy of beautiful women who said Alexander sexually assaulted them filled a jury box. The 13 women cried as Wesley recounted some of the crimes and they held hands as the sentence was read. One had mascara running down her face; another shook her head in disgust at Alexander.</p>
<p>Three of the women spoke, each telling a packed courtroom how Alexander had robbed them of their innocence and their formative years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was 14. You took my adolescence, my trust, my dream and completely manipulated them for your sexual desires,&#8221; said one of the women. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It sickens me that a grown man can do such a thing to a girl,&#8221; the now 17-year-old girl said. &#8220;A girl who was naive and had the belief that all people were good. And you took that to your advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Alexander often found women online, baited them with promises of glamorous photo shoots and other modeling work, only to fondle or rape them at his Beverly Hills apartment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a constant reminder of the day that I, the biggest daddy&rsquo;s girl in the world, had to tell my dad that I had been raped by this person,&#8221; said another woman, now 21. Alexander was convicted of raping her in March 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alexander, wearing a dark suit with his long black hair tied in a ponytail, put on a pair of black-rimmed glasses but otherwise showed no emotion. It was a stark contrast to earlier in the day when he argued a motion for a new trial, even breaking down into tears at one point.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wesley has already turned down a previous motion for a new trial after it was discovered that juror Alvin Dymally had contacted Alexander&rsquo;s sister Sanjana. Wesley found both in contempt of court after determining Dymally appeared to want a romantic relationship with her when he spoke to her by phone twice during the trial and offered his help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beverly Hills police began investigating Alexander in March 2007 when a woman reported she had been sexually assaulted in his apartment.</p>
<p>During the trial, prosecutors relied heavily on the testimony from women who made the accusations against Alexander. Defense attorneys argued many of women were lying about what happened to them and sought revenge against Alexander when they didn&rsquo;t get modeling jobs. Alexander has maintained his innocence.</p>
<p>Alexander also faces similar charges in New York and Texas, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Born in India, Alexander graduated from the Parsons School of Design in New York and launched a fashion line in 1999.<br>

		<p>Well, if he serves ALL the time, he&rsquo;ll only be 94 when he gets out.  He&rsquo;ll really be able to appreciate young chics by then.</p>
<p>I hope he&rsquo;s like the kid who ran all over town raping, pillaging and committing untold violence, and when he appeared before the judge he was slammed with 99 years, to which he replied with tears in his eyes, &#8220;But judge, I can&rsquo;t do 99 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the judge responded with a soothing, &#8220;That&rsquo;s all right, son.  Just do the best you can.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There is nothing surprising here.  Brown males living in the West consider conquest of white females to be the highest achievement they can aspire to.  </p>
<p>Among Indians, white skin is a national obsession. White female models are hired to look adoringly at brown celebrity males back in the homeland. Conquest is the subliminal message.</p>
<p>Rare and unique white genetics occupy a desirable plateau in this brown majority world.  Brown females also hunt for white trophies, but usually for marriage, children, and security.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t recall the name, but one city in India is the &#8220;rape capital&#8221; of the world. Per a story aired on NPR Radio in the past. But different (third-world) countries have different social mores, see rape as simply a misdemeanor (like Mexicans), rather than a serious afront and attack on women.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a common misconception that Indians are a &#8220;model minority.&#8221;  Whereas, for example, Mexicans are uneducated and crime-prone, Indians are the opposite   &mdash;   educated, civilized, assimilated and cultured, providing the U.S. with information technology genius.  Conservatives such as George Gilder make exactly this point to justify far higher levels of immigration from India.  This news item, if nothing else, suggests an underside.  </p>

I guarantee the &#8220;Rape Capital of the World&#8221; is in South Africa, or perhaps an American slum. Pakistan and India can probably give Mexico a run for their money, but no one can match African depravity.<br>

There are many straight men with fetishes for articles of women&rsquo;s clothes and especially shoes. There are also, however, a few straight men in the fashion industry who are just artistic (and probably Italian)</p>

		<p>Most non White males and especially men from the middle east and south asia have a very low opinion of White women. According to them all White women are loose whores while their own women are extremely moral (which is a lie, I know this personally as I have frequented India, the U.A.E and Egypt). They believe that they have the license to do as they please with white women. This is also a way of getting back at White men whom they hate (and secretly envy). I have met many ugly men from these two regions who believe that they are a gift to White women (which they are obviously not)</p>
<p>   Many White parents do not prepare their daughters for this. I am not claiming that all White men are angels but people in the first world have no clue of how manipulative and abusive men are in the third world. I have seen many naive White women go alone to places in the third world where even most  local women would never dream of going. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Anand Jon Alexander had to be imported.  Our fashion designers are nearly all white women or white homosexual men, not nearly enough diversity.</p>

You may be quite mistaken in Pakistan the Islamic law says a woman has to have 4 males witness a rape for a conviction to take place, this is quite common in Muslim nations even in North Africa(read white Arab) if she cannot produce these &#8220;witnesses&#8221; its seen as her committing adultry! she is then put in jail to protect her from a due and just honor killing for allah. The first sex act an Indian female has with another male is almost always RAPE by her father or brother or other close relatives. Incest is very very big there.(they swear at each other saying &#8220;your&rsquo;re a sister @#$%) even for males its a risk V.S Naipaul the famous Indian writer has admitted his cousin would rape him as a child.</p>
<p>They pretend to be prudes but we know better.</p>

		<p>Gay Conservative:  Most effeminate men are not homosexual, and most homosexuals are not effeminate&hellip;although there is more overlap between groups than in the general population.  Learned that in a Baptist Young Adults Sunday School class, of all places.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that if a man were truly &#8216;straight&rsquo;, he would not need to rape to get his kicks.  After all, there were surely droves of stupid white women throwing themselves at him, anyway&hellip;you know&hellip;with the long hair and his &#8216;romantic&rsquo; looks&hellip;and his connection to the fashion world&hellip;a real chick magnet&hellip;</p>
<p>And molesting teen girls may not be all he did for thrills.  After he proved his &#8216;manhood&rsquo; with the hapless females, he may well have hit the gay bars&hellip;  I worked with a Latino book editor who aggressively hit on white women ceaselessly when we were on photo shoots, then trolled for dudes into the wee hours (desk clerks will tell you MUCH, if you treat them like people). </p>
<p>And wasn&rsquo;t there a post on here last month about SoCal brothels trafficking Mexican boys?  Who knows?  We may never hear the whole story.  We probably don&rsquo;t WANT to hear the whole story&hellip;</p>
