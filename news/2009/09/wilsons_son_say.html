<h1>Wilson&rsquo;s Son Says Congressman Is Not Racist</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Bluestein, Yahoo! News, September 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson&rsquo;s oldest son defended his father against a claim by former President Jimmy Carter that the congressman&rsquo;s outburst during a speech by President Barack Obama was &#8220;based on racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Responding to an audience question at a town hall at his presidential center in Atlanta, Carter said Tuesday that Wilson&rsquo;s outburst was also rooted in fears of a black president.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s based on racism,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;There is an inherent feeling among many in this country that an African-American should not be president.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Wilson&rsquo;s son disputed that.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not a racist bone in my dad&rsquo;s body,&#8221; said Alan Wilson, an Iraq veteran who is running for state attorney general in South Carolina. &#8220;He doesn&rsquo;t even laugh at distasteful jokes. I won&rsquo;t comment on former President Carter, because I don&rsquo;t know President Carter. But I know my dad, and it&rsquo;s just not in him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s unfortunate people make that jump. People can disagree  &mdash;  and appropriately disagree  &mdash;  on issues of substance, but when they make the jump to race it&rsquo;s absolutely ludicrous. My brothers and I were raised by our parents to respect everyone regardless of background or race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carter, a Democrat, said Joe Wilson&rsquo;s outburst was a part of a disturbing trend directed at the president that has included demonstrators equating Obama to Nazi leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those kind of things are not just casual outcomes of a sincere debate on whether we should have a national program on health care,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s deeper than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>South Carolina&rsquo;s former Democratic Party chairman [Dick Harpootlian, who has known Wilson for decades] also said he doesn&rsquo;t believe Wilson was motivated by racism, but said the outburst encouraged racist views.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a bunch of folks out there looking for some comfort in their racial issues. They have a problem with an African-American president,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But was he motivated by that? I don&rsquo;t think so. I respectfully disagree with President Carter, though it gives validity to racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele accused Democrats of using the race issue to shift attention away from the health care plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Carter is flat out wrong. This isn&rsquo;t about race. It is about policy,&#8221; Steele said in a statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilson, a former state senator elected to Congress in 2001, is known as a mild-mannered lawmaker with hard-line conservative views. But he has been confrontational in the past.</p>
<p>In 2003, Wilson called it &#8220;unseemly&#8221; and a &#8220;smear&#8221; for the mixed-race daughter of Sen. Strom Thurmond, Essie Mae Washington-Williams, to identify the longtime South Carolina senator as her father after his death.</p>
<p>After a public outcry, he reversed course and said he had the utmost respect for Washington-Williams.</p>
<p>As a state senator, he was an outspoken opponent of efforts to remove the Confederate flag from atop the South Carolina Statehouse.<br>

		<p>As many posters have said here before, why waste all this effort worrying what is or isn&rsquo;t &#8220;racist&#8221;?   Who cares?  We shouldn&rsquo;t even let that bother us. We should ignore it.  Too many people are intimidated by the r-word. That&rsquo;s what is used to keep them in line.  What matters is what works, not what&rsquo;s racist. </p>

		<p>Of course Wilson&rsquo;s son is correct (though I wish he were not), but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.  When the CBC and nutroots say jump, Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer ask how high.  There&rsquo;s to be no criticism at all of The Messiah, even mild criticism.</p>

		<p>The left is employing psychological warfare.  The Right is so gullible they fall into the trap everytime it is set.</p>
<p>The purpose of racism accusations for the Left in general is to put the Right on the defensive and instill within them white guilt, so that everytime the charge is levied they practically fall over themselves in denial, oblivious to all other things.  They wind up as stuttering fools, trying to defend a charge that only blacks and the self-hating whites are guilty of.</p>
<p>This psychology enables the left to avoid having to offer logical rebuttal to charges of misconduct or criminality or to any kind of criticism from one of their hare-brained schemes.</p>
<p>For the blacks, who can&rsquo;t compete equally for positions that require a higher intelligence or entry requirements requiring acceptable test scores, it means all they have to do to get what they want is to scream racism.  That&rsquo;s how affirmative action in employment, school entry, school grades and certification came about.  It was appeasement by the right to oil the squeaky wheels and concoct a set of standards for blacks and Hispanics&hellip;which were lower than what was in effect for whites.</p>
<p>This ploy has worked beautifully for them, but only because the Right has always lacked the spine to levy the same charge to self-hating whites&hellip;with examples&hellip;&hellip;and they&rsquo;re entirely too gutless to come right out and tell blacks they can&rsquo;t get ahead, because of their low intelligence and ability, and their failures have very little to do with any kind of racism.  So the beat goes on. </p>
<p>But our greatest enemies are self-hating whites and it is they who have caused our society to fall, and they have placed us in the situation we are in today.</p>
<p>There needs to be many more charges of racism coming from the Right, non-stop, everytime the Left turns around.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t happen.  The only thing that will save PART of this country for whites IS A COMPLETE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE that results in secession and separation.</p>
<p>It is impossible to live with blacks by anyone of any race.  Blacks are the scourge of mankind.</p>

		<p>Well, here it is, folks.  Once again, the imbecilic former president Carter can&rsquo;t keep his mouth shut.  Taking the high moral ground, this fine southern gentleman had the effrontery to say that even if Rep. Collins did not agree with Mr. Obama on policy, as the President of the US he deserves more respect than to be called a liar  &mdash;   even if he is one.  Gracious.  Never mind how gentleman Jim Carter himself shows respect for a sitting president  &mdash;   G.W. Bush  &mdash;   by personally traveling around the globe to polish the boots of Chavez, Castro, and Yassar Arafat while bad-mouthing Bush and US foreign policy.  That&rsquo;s not only disrespectful, fellow citizens, its downright treasonous, if not sickening.  But don&rsquo;t expect any apolgies forthcoming from Mr. Carter anytime soon, if at all; it&rsquo;s just not in a man when he is afflicted with congenital stupidity.        </p>

		<p>Mr. Carter, racism is a valid standpoint, unlike anti-semitism. Whites are quite right to want their nations run by folks like themselves, and to exclude others from high posts. After all, what non-white countries followed suit when we threw open our society to their brethren?</p>

		<p>Why do people like this son, always have to go out and claim they are not &#8220;racist&#8221;? Give it up. Quit being on the defensive and start going on the offense! No need to reply to one of the worst  President we ever had. . He knows nothing and needs to get back to his Habitat For Humanity.  Only MINORITIES are the recipients of those homes it seems, so Carter is a racist against Whites, is he not? EVERYONE is a RACIST. It is a natural instinct to protect ones race from annihilation and it seems that only Whites are the ones who cannot see that. The other races sure do. </p>

<p>Obama is pushing the same socialist policies that democrats have been pushing for years. The only difference is that with a white president, the issue is the issue. But with a black president they can make race the issue.</p>

		<p> I recently finished Ron Kessler&rsquo;s fascinating new book, &#8220;In the President&rsquo;s Secret Service: Behind the Scenes With Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect,&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the agents had to say about Jimmy Carter:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Jimmy Carter was the least likeable president.</p>
<p>Agents told Kessler that Jimmy Carter treated them and others who served him with utter disdain.</p>
<p>Carter treated with contempt the little people who helped and protected him and told agents not to look at him or speak to him.</p>
<p>At the same time, Carter tried to project an image of himself as man of the people by carrying his own luggage when traveling. But that was often for show. When he was a candidate in 1976, Carter would carry his own bags when the press was around but ask the Secret Service to carry them the rest of the time.</p>
<p>On one occasion, disgruntled agents deliberately left Carter&rsquo;s luggage in the trunk of his car at an airport, and Carter was without clothes for two days.</p>
<p>Carter was moody and mistrustful and sought to micromanage everything, agents told Kessler. </p>
<p>Early in his presidency, Carter proclaimed that the White House would be &#8216;dry,&rsquo; and only wine, but no liquor, would be served at state dinners.</p>
<p>The word was passed to get rid of all the booze on Air Force One, at Camp David, and in the White House. But on the first Sunday the Carters were in the White House, they ordered up Bloody Marys before going to church&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/lpdy3e" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/lpdy3e</a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more on Carter&rsquo;s hypocrisy and general all around meanness toward &#8216;the little people&rsquo; in the newsmax.com article linked above.  </p>
<p>A man of the people?  Gimme a break.</p>

Exactly. As soon as I read the first sentence, it turned me off. As long as people are on the defensive and terrified of the R word, they will get nowhere because they are captives of the leftist mentality. They are required to play within the leftist playpen.  They are only allowed to defend themselves within the parameters of leftist values and by using the vocabulary of the left. </p>

		<p>Carter if asked could not define &#8220;racism&#8221;, no one if asked point blank what it meant could rattle off any dictionary definition of the word, they will always be dumbfounded, try it in any conversation.  Racism once meant power, now show me where the tea party types have any power, at all?  Anti-racism is nothing but being anti white.</p>

		<p>First, Congressman Wilson&rsquo;s son should have declined to dignify any of the lefties&rsquo; accusations by not saying anything at all.  As pointed out in many comments here, we Whites need to stop running scared of being called &#8220;racist&#8221; and learn to turn the tables on our enemies.</p>
<p>Second, Carter go home!!!   You do not fit the role of &#8220;elder statesman&#8221;.  You had your chance, and you bungled everything you did from 1977 to 1981.  We don&rsquo;t need your meddling in matters now.  Go back to Plains, and enjoy your old age. You are, in particular, a disgrace to the South. </p>

		<p>Jimmy Carter needs to realize that religion and race aren&rsquo;t as different as he thinks. He wants to be an anti-racist but there are implications for his Christian religion. Perhaps he hasn&rsquo;t noticed but we never hear Christian politicians saying Christianity is a true or better religion. They&rsquo;ll say their Christian faith is important for their values but for political reasons they can&rsquo;t say that non-Christians would be better off converting. It makes Carter seem like a hollow man. He has such strong values against racism but he&rsquo;s not allowed to assert his Christian faith. </p>

		<p>I had a comment all thought out, but then I saw others had already spoken for me. Anonymous in #1 hits the nail on the head. The key for us is to go on the offensive and never get defensive. Every charge of &#8220;racism&#8221; or &#8220;hatred&#8221; should be met with a counter-charge: &#8220;No, you&rsquo;re the racists, you&rsquo;re the haters.&#8221; Push, push, push. Accuse, accuse, accuse. Never play their game. Forget the &#8220;moral high ground&#8221;  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s for good losers. </p>

		<p>White people just have to get out of the habit of always explaining how they are not racist. You can only take so much of White&rsquo;s starting a sentence with &#8220;I&rsquo;m not racist&#8221;, that is almost as bad as &#8220;Some of my best friend&rsquo;s are  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  &#8221;. The worst example of this is watching a mixed race panel of five or six people discussing the latest physical or verbal atrocity by a black. White&rsquo;s on the panel will always point out that they also condemn bad behavior by White&rsquo;s or mention that they were active in the civil right&rsquo;s movement. Never ever will you see or hear a black person behave this way.</p>

		<p>I can prove that it was not racist.The very fact that Jimmy Carter states that it is is prima facia evidence that it is not. Really, who else has been wrong as consistently and often as Carter. He was the worst president in history until 8 months ago.<br>
If Jimmy Carter ever agrees with you it is time to change your opinion.He was so stupid 30 years ago that he got crushed by Ronald Reagen by 50 states. And he is more stupid today.How stupid do you have to be to open the eyes of that many democrats. How much more wrong can a man be? When a mann is that stupid you cannot fix it.</p>

		<p>I utterly despise Jimmy Carter; no one could be a more failed human being in my opinion (and I use the definition &ldquo;human being,&rdquo; very loosely here with Comrade Jimmy,) let alone a more failed President of the United States. Yes, that even includes Comrade BO.</p>
<p>So I wonder, if that indicates that I am only a &ldquo;right wing loon&rdquo; or a rather sophisticated &ldquo;racist?&rdquo; </p>
