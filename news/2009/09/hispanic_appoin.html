		<p>Obama, like all black racists employs the ABC policy that many blacks and some Hispanic employ in everything they do and everything they&rsquo;re involved with, when it comes to selecting personnel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the &#8220;Anybody But Caucasians&#8221; policy.  Those like the messiah hate most whites so much they would rather see a minority face rather than a white one everywhere in this country. Isn&rsquo;t it obvious that&rsquo;s why he picks non-whites for positions requiring less intelligence and accomplishment?</p>
<p>This practice by him makes the white Obama supporters fools of the highest order and they are the greatest enemies we have.  They&rsquo;re too idiotic to know they&rsquo;re no more than useful idiots to this man and his cadre of white haters.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck is right.  Obama IS a racist and so is Eric Holder only more so.  Do we have to mention Van Jones too?  Mark Lloyd?  Jeremiah Wright? Louis Farrakhan?  How about millions  more throughout the country?  Obama even associates with whites who hate whites, so deep is his hatred.  His religion is the same as his pastor, J. Wright and Van Jones:  Black Theology.</p>
<p>A person doesn&rsquo;t sit in a church for 22 years listening to white hatred preached without agreeing with it.</p>

		<p>Today&rsquo;s Big Lie is the claim that a certain number of blacks, hispanics and other non-whites have to be appointed by any administration in order for this to be a &#8220;color-blind society.&#8221; This is utter garbage as we all know. Rather than being &#8220;color-blind&#8221; or &#8220;random&#8221; the appointment of a certain number of hispanics, blacks, etc. is an extremely conscious decision on the part of any agency. The mentality always is &#8220;We have to appoint &#8220;X&#8221; number of hispanics since they are &#8220;X&#8221; percentage of the population.  We have to appoint &#8220;X&#8221; number of blacks since they are &#8220;X&#8221; percentage of the population.&#8221; Maybe they even think, &#8221; &#8220;We have to appoint MORE than &#8220;X&#8221; number of hispanics or blacks since they have been &#8220;historically discriminated against.&#8221; &#8220;Color-blindness&#8221; is always the opposite of what it claims: it is extreme color consciousness, even color-obsession. True &#8220;Color-blindness&#8221; would mean hiring strictly based on merit, but we know that is never done because it would not result in the &#8220;correct proportions&#8221; of racial groups. The whole concept is a fraud and a sham and always will be, and its sole purpose is the eventual disenfranchisement of whites.</p>

		<p>How many African-American, ethnic African, Arab, East Asian, South Asian, South/East Asian, Australasian, Australian Aborigine, Maori, Mongolian and/or Turkish candidates has his administration appointed in total so far?</p>
<p>One has to ask, are these and the many other past and recent alien occupiers of North America, happy with this turn of events in relation to what appears to be undisguised favourism being showered upon Latinos?</p>

		<p>Poster #3&hellip;How many African Americans has he appointed?  About as many as the &#8220;hispanics&#8221; I would guess. Also how many of those appointees are really White? I would say about 2. </p>

		<p>Since it&rsquo;s been proven that whites were actually here - N. America - before so-called &#8220;Native Americans&#8221; I guess the only non-aliens in the US are whites. After all, propaganda aside, it was the hated white man that built America. Not blacks, most of whom in fact lived in the rural South until the 1920&rsquo;s, and certainly not Latinos, most of whom still live a primitive, tribal / gang based existence in their &#8220;villages&#8221;, whether they are South of the Border or in the US. </p>
<p>In the end, what we see in the US is a white civilization that was invaded by aliens. Sure, the doors were opened by traitors &#8220;inside&#8221;, who still try to hide their agenda even though the aware folks have figured it out, but here we are. With the aliens like Obama and his puppet masters calling the shots for now. At least their &#8220;world&#8221; here in America is collapsing. Too bad it has to get worse before it gets better for whites. </p>
