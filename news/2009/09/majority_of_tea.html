			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Hickley, Daily Mail (London), September 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three-quarters of teachers in Britain&rsquo;s schools believe they should warn pupils about the dangers of patriotism  &mdash;  which some regard as a form of &#8216;brainwashing&rsquo;, researchers have found.</p>
<p>A nationwide study found the majority of teachers felt they should not be promoting the subject at all in the classroom, with some preferring to instruct their pupils in the benefits of &#8216;universal brotherhood&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And even those who felt positively about patriotism felt the need to qualify and tone down their support, stressing that they disliked &#8216;jingoistic flag-waving&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The findings are a blow for the Government after Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke out in favour of encouraging pupils to be patriotic, calling for &#8216;Britishness&rsquo; lessons to be part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>The study by the Institute of Education at the University of London surveyed teachers and pupils at 20 secondary schools, and found 74 per cent believed it was their duty to point out the danger of patriotic sentiments.</p>
<p>&#8216;Praising patriotism excludes non-British pupils,&rsquo; one teacher told researchers.</p>
<p>&#8216;Patriotism about being British divides groups along racial lines, when we aim to bring pupils to an understanding of what makes us the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other responses included:</p>
<p>* &#8216;We shouldn&rsquo;t be promoting patriotism. We should be promoting universal brotherhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* &#8216;I think we should identify as humans.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* &#8216;I don&rsquo;t think you should be grooming children to be patriotic. That&rsquo;s as bad as telling everyone that they&rsquo;ve got to be a certain religion  &mdash;  I am not going to brainwash anyone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While two-thirds of teachers claimed they encouraged discussion of patriotism in their classrooms, more than half of pupils said patriotism was never discussed at school.</p>
<p>In their report, Dr Joanne Pearce and Dr Michael Hand argue much of history and politics is incomprehensible without understanding of the power of patriotic sentiment.</p>
<p>They told the Times Educational Supplement: &#8216;Schools have a responsibility to ensure that students not only understand the phenomenon of patriotism, but are equipped to make reasoned judgments about the place it should occupy in their own emotional lives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Novelist and commentator Frederick Forsyth said: &#8216;I wish these teachers would see that patriotism in the sense of that quiet pride is nothing to be afraid of. It&rsquo;s not aggressive. It doesn&rsquo;t put down foreigners. It doesn&rsquo;t noisily wave flags and it certainly doesn&rsquo;t swerve towards the BNP.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pupils at a state comprehensive school are to be given therapy lessons by staff from a celebrity rehab clinic on drug addiction, anger management and eating disorders.</p>
<p>Teachers at Notley High, Braintree, Essex, have teamed up with experts from the private Priory hospitals, which are better known for helping celebrities such as Amy Winehouse overcome their excesses.</p>
<p>They have developed a programme of cognitive behaviour therapy to tackle issues including anger, low self esteem, eating disorders and drug addiction.</p>
<p>Staff hope the voluntary lessons will help pupils avoid developing such problems in the first place.<br/>

		<p> In retrospect,the R.A.F. should have repositioned those radar towers on the roofs of the Administration buidings at Oxford and Cambridge. Then when the Stuka`s came over it would have been only half a disaster&hellip; While the Hurricanes and Spits should have been plowing a field at Angels 15 for the incoming Heinkels headed toward Whitehall. Lastly, I can`t imagine what it must feel like to realize that you saved as a young man the very government turning on you in your old age. I guess it`s too late to start a &#8220;Beatle Bonfire&#8221; of Victoria Crosses from 617 Dambuster Squadron! Looks like the 1000 year memory of Britian`s &#8220;finest hour&#8221; lasted just a half dozen decades longer than the Third Reich. Who woulda  ever figured?!?&hellip;</p>

		<p>fire these pansy &#8220;educators&#8221; and hire men and women proud of their nation and the British people-white people-who created a wonderful civilization. Of course the best answer is to toss the Muslim and African &#8220;students&#8221; out of the nation and teach the descendents of real Britons.</p>

		<p>Without love of and devotion to God, Queen and country Britain is just an island not a cohesive nation.  A nation is like an extended family, we may not always get along but we usually stick together and play nice when we are around our patriarch/matriarch (Grandpa/Grandma).</p>

<p>Much of history and politics is incomprehensible without understanding the fellowship of race. </p>
<p>The battles fought to defend the race of Europe from invaders, from pre-history up until the last century, makes the contemporary open-border immigration policies of the last 40 years an incomprehensible reversal.</p>
<p>Rather than explain the recent origins of suicidal immigration policies, or attempt an intellectual defense of the indefensible, these teachers just want their charges to hate patriots and patriotism.<br/>

		<p>This survey was done in London metro area schools, whose staff and faculty are mainly third world.  Of course they&rsquo;re against patriotism.</p>
<p>But why should anyone trust Gordon Clown to tell us what patriotism is?  For all we know, his version of &#8220;patriotism&#8221; is egalitarian necro-imperial &#8220;invade/invite the world&#8221; drivel.</p>

		<p>When was the last time patriotism was actively encouraged in schools?:Answer: During the second world war.<br/>
Since the arrival of the third world Trojan Horse the SS Windrush in 1948 the history of the British Isles,and England in particular,has been incrementally reduced in significance over the years for fear of offending a growing and increasingly assertive non-european &#8220;community&#8221;.Where history has not been overtly re-written to remove all traces of the English from their own past,over-emphasis has been placed on the role of Britain in the slave trade(we actually abolished it,but no thanks there),the cruelty of Empire(why do they all want to move here?)and the elevation of a mixed race nursing assistant (Mary Secole)to national heroine,while consigning the greater part played by her boss,Florence Nightingale to the dustbin.England now is a country where it is ILLEGAL to describe oneself as English on official forms and where the flying of the cross of St George can,depending on the zeal of the borough council,land you in court.The declaration made by this dysfunctional cartel of traitors may have propelled this into the public consciousness,but the damage began many years ago. </p>

<p>&gt; According to everything in the NT, they are.  There is nothing in the NT about preserving one&rsquo;s ethnicity or race - everyone is the same in Christ, is the message of the Apostle Paul.  So those race realists who think Christianity supports their notion of race and national preservation are tragically wrong.  Tragically wrong, because they are defeating themselves by insisting on this when it is so obviously untrue to any objective analysis.  Not only that, but if you read history, particularly Edward Gibbon&rsquo;s English language classic, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, it is blantantly clear that early Christianity spread because of the institutional re-distribution of wealth from wealthy converts to poor.  They expanded the Jewish Essene style commune into the entire Meditteranean world.  This is communism, no way to deny that.  This is why I always try to persuade Northern European whites and their descendants that they ought to be reviving a new version of their real ethnic roots.  A study of how Celtic people ruled themselves before Christianity would be very interesting to many, I think.  And we all know about the Norse world view.</p>

		<p>Displaying national pride, pride in one&rsquo;s heritage is jingoistic and unacceptable? I hope, I pray I live to see the day when this liberal nonsense literally EXPLODES! When the common masses in every first-world White nation tells the liberal fools to get stuffed! To take their worthles claptrap nonsense and get lost. Hopefully, forever!</p>

		<p>Sofita: I strongly disagree that genuine Christianity would have us abolish races. After all, it was God Himself who created them. Liberal humanists with their &#8220;melting pot&#8221; want to blend and destroy what God made. They put their egos above His.</p>
<p>From cover to cover, the Bible affirms that God divided the nations. The Greek word used in the Bible for nation is ethnos, which denotes race and ethnicity. The Apostle Paul never said that peoples were abolished in Christ. What he said that they could enjoy spiritual unity in Christ. Paul expressed great love for his &#8220;kinsmen according to the flesh,&#8221; and stated that God divided the nations so that &#8220;they might seek after God.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Christianity is destructive to our race, why were we strong when we were strongly Christian?   </p>

		<p>I would urge every reader to purchase a history book or two, and a book of inventions&hellip; because the day is coming when the liberal fools amongst us will make it a criminal act to give credit to Whites for anything. We are already trying to steal the credit for world-wide achievements by the White race and unfairly downplay what we accomplished, or worse yet, give credit to third-worlders.</p>

		<p>&#8220;According to everything in the NT, they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree.  As Christians, we are expected to love all people and recognize their dignity as children of God, but I do not understand why that should mean that we have to love all people equally.  I have to love your children, but I am expected to love my own children more.  No Christian would ever question that, yet PC Christians expect me to love other races as much as my own.  I don&rsquo;t get that.</p>
<p>Whiteplight, one thing that you simply must understand about Christianity is that Christ is a redeemer of humanity.  He didn&rsquo;t change us or make us any &#8220;holier&#8221; or better, he just redeemed us.  We are what we are.  God created us with an instinct to survive and perpetuate our own kind.  Sometimes, these instincts have turned ugly.  Christ came to wipe away the sin that sometimes results from our instincts; he did not come to destroy our instincts. He is pro-human and life-affirming.</p>
<p>Lets say you are right that Christ demands that we become utterly selfless, other-centered beings and thereby achieve salvation and a right relationship with God.  If that is so, then why did he come and die on the Cross?  He could have just told us this and we could have saved ourselves.  That is a heresy.  Its called Pelagianism.  I don&rsquo;t want to get off on theological tangents here but I think this whole issue is tremendously important to the relationship between WN and Christianity.  The idea that the two are incompatible, I believe, rests on a misunderstanding of Christianity as some sort of buddhist-like path of self-salvation through ego transcendence.  I assure you that is not what Christianity is.</p>

		<p>Christian doctrine and its institutions have long since been infiltrated by Communist and Communist inspired Liberal idealists.</p>
<p>All of today&rsquo;s Christian clergy have become inherently and hopelessly Communist and Communist inspired Liberal converts.</p>
<p>We need to either abolish this corrupted form of Christianity and start over afresh or abandon Christianity altogether.</p>
