<h1><a href="http://globalpolitician.com/25869-sweden-immigration-islam">Sweden Tops European Rape League  &mdash;  But Why?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fjordman, Global Politician, August 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As recently as a few weeks ago, the hostile Wikipedia entry on &#8220;Fjordman&#8221; claimed that my previous essays about the Swedish rape epidemic are false because the massive increase in rapes was caused by &#8220;a widening of the legal definition of rape.&#8221; I bet it was.</p>
<p>Now I notice that statement has now been quietly removed. This is probably why  &mdash;  &#8220;Sweden tops European rape league.&#8221;<blockquote>Sweden has the highest incidence of reported rapes in Europe  &mdash;  twice as many as &#8220;runner up&#8221; the UK, a new study shows. Researchers behind the EU study, which will be presented on Tuesday, conclude that rape appears to be a more common occurrence in Sweden than in continental European countries. In Sweden, 46 incidents of rape are reported per 100,000 residents. This figure is double as many as in the UK which reports 23 cases, and four times that of the other Nordic countries, Germany and France. The figure is up to 20 times the figure for certain countries in southern and eastern Europe.<br>
</blockquote></p>
<p>My comment: As I have explained in my book <cite>Defeating Eurabia,</cite> where I devote an entire chapter to explaining the appalling situation in Sweden, Ethnologist Maria Bäckman, in her study &#8220;Whiteness and gender,&#8221; has followed a group of Swedish girls in the suburb of Rinkeby outside Stockholm, where natives have been turned into a minority of the inhabitants due to immigration. The subjects &#8220;may encounter prejudices such as the idea that Swedish girls act and dress in a sexually provocative way or that blonde girls are easy.&#8221; Bäckman relates that several of the Swedish girls she interviewed stated that they had dyed their hair to avoid sexual harassment. They experienced that being blonde involves old men staring at you, cars honking their horns and boys calling you &#8220;whore.&#8221;</p>
<p>A report from the organization Save the Children told that Swedish girls are scared of being raped, a possibility that appears very real to them. A survey carried out among ninth-grade boys in the immigrant-dominated suburb of Rinkeby showed that in the last year, 17% of the boys had forced someone to have sex, 31% had hurt someone so badly that the victim required medical care, and 24% had committed burglary or broken into a car. Sensational statistics, but they appear to have been published only in a daily newssheet that is distributed free on the subways.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not as wrong raping a Swedish girl as raping an Arab girl,&#8221; says Hamid, in an interview about a gang rape involving a Swedish girl and immigrant perps. &#8220;The Swedish girl gets a lot of help afterwards, and she had probably f**ked before, anyway. But the Arab girl will get problems with her family. For her, being raped is a source of shame. It is important that she retains her virginity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is far too easy to get a Swedish whore .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. girl, I mean;&#8221; says Hamid, and laughs over his own choice of words. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have too much respect for Swedish girls. I guess you can say they get f**ked to pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an article from June 2007 with the title &#8220;Summertime  &mdash;  rape time,&#8221; Aftonbladet, one of the largest dailies in Scandinavia, linked the spike in rapes during the summer to the warm weather. The official number of rape charges in Sweden has more than quadrupled during one generation, even more for girls under the age of 15. If this is due to the warm weather, I suppose the Scandinavian rape wave is caused by global warming? The fact that a greatly disproportionate number of the suspects have an immigrant background according to statistics from neighboring Norway and Denmark is purely coincidental, no doubt.</p>
<p>According to journalist Karen Jespersen, Helle Klein, the political editor-in-chief of Aftonbladet from 2001 to 2007 and a former leading member of the Social Democratic Youth League, has stated that &#8220;If the debate is [about] that there are problems caused by refugees and immigrants, we don&rsquo;t want it.&#8221; Opinion polls have revealed that two out of three Swedes doubt whether Islam can be combined with Swedish society, yet not one party in parliament has been genuinely critical of the immigration policies.</p>
<p>The rape numbers are being heavily manipulated by the authorities and the media, who claim that the massive increase in rapes is caused by:</p>
<p><nobreak>A.&nbsp;The warm weather</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;Alcohol,</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;Internet dating sites, and</nobreak></p>
<p>D.&nbsp;A technical increase due to the fact that women suddenly report rape more frequently than before.</p>
<p>These are the explanations that are mentioned. There is no other. Suggesting that it has something to do with mass immigration of alien and aggressive cultures is quite literally banned by law. In March 2007 during a rally supported by SSU, the Social Democratic Youth League, a man carried a sign reading, &#8220;While Swedish girls are being gang raped by immigrant gangs the SSU is fighting racism.&#8221; He was promptly arrested and later sentenced to a fine because he &#8220;expressed disrespect for a group of people with reference to their national or ethnic background.&#8221; The local court rejected the man&rsquo;s free speech argument because even free speech has its limits, and he had clearly acted in a too provocative manner.</p>
<p>The Leftist, Multicultural organization Amnesty International will never say anything about the fact that this massive spike in rapes is caused by mass immigration, a mass immigration that it and other international organizations want to continue indefinitely, until the native population has been reduced to a persecuted minority in the lands where their ancestors have lived since prehistoric times, in a country that has no colonial history. Just like all problems according to Nazism were automatically blamed on Jews, so all problems according to Multiculturalism are automatically blamed on whites. We are now witnessing a wave of rape and violent crime in many European countries which is unprecedented in modern history. It&rsquo;s not &#8220;crime,&#8221; but in fact resembles warfare. Yet we can&rsquo;t say that non-white immigrants commit almost all of the gang rapes and the most brutal rapes, as is documented from neighboring Norway. Consequently, one must blame &#8220;ordinary Swedish men&#8221; (Read: white males). Whites, and white women in particular, are the victims of an accelerating wave of violence and abuse caused by mass immigration and Multiculturalism. The response of &#8220;human rights groups&#8221; such as Amnesty and the UN to this is to continue mass immigration and Multiculturalism as if nothing has happened and intensify the efforts to break down and destroy whites, white men in particular.</p>

								<h2>Sweden Tops European Rape League</h2>
						<p>
							<i>The Local (Stockholm), April 27, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Researchers behind the EU study, which will be presented on Tuesday, conclude that rape appears to be a more common occurrence in Sweden than in continental European countries.</p>
<p>In Sweden, 46 incidents of rape are reported per 100,000 residents.</p>
<p>This figure is double as many as in the UK which reports 23 cases, and four times that of the other Nordic countries, Germany and France. The figure is up to 20 times the figure for certain countries in southern and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The study, which is financed by the Brussels-based EU fund Daphne II, compared how the respective judicial systems managed rape cases across eleven EU countries. Sweden is shown in an unfavourable light, according to the study.</p>
<p>The high figures in Sweden can not it seems be explained purely by an increased tendency to report rapes and other more minor sexual offences.</p>
<p>Rape simply appears to be a more common occurrence in Sweden than in the other EU countries studied, the researchers argue.</p>
<p>Over 5,000 rapes are reported in Sweden per annum while reports in other countries of a comparable size amounted to only a few hundred.</p>
<p>The figures can however be somewhat distorted as it is often only assault rapes by strangers and aggravated acquaintance rapes that are reported in many of these countries  &mdash;  as was the case in Sweden 40 years ago.</p>
<p>The high incidence of rape in Sweden has a strong connection to nightlife and partying, specifically after-club parties in private homes.</p>
<p>Early sexual debuts, high alcohol consumption, &#8220;free sexuality&#8221; and the &#8220;right to say no&#8221; quite simply results in more rapes, the study concludes.</p>
<p>The Daphne II fund ran from 2004-2008 and was set up by the European Parliament as a specific programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk.</p>
<p>In 2007 Daphne III was launched to continue the work and is funded up to 2013.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, in this culture Swedish rape victims will defend their assailants at all costs.  There will never be an outcry among them, and castrated Swedish men will never acknowledge the reality of the situation.  One would hope that, if anything, Sweden can be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of Europe.</p>

		<p>Rape is a weapon of war. An undeclared war, but a war nonetheless. The &#8220;minority&#8221;, the &#8220;invader&#8221;, is saying to the host society, &#8220;we despise you, your culture, your mores, and most importantly, your young women. We are here to stay and will be the boss, get used to it!! We defile the most important thing to you, and you cannot do a thing about it!&#8221; &#8216;We are strong, you are weak!!&#8221;</p>
<p>And correct too that this rape is not caused by socio-economic-deprivation-and-I-am-so-poor-and-you-are-to-blame!</p>
<p>And GANG RAPE as a phenomenon was totally UNKNOWN until recently in Sweden or other European countries for that matter? NOW is not uncommon - - and is strictly an &#8220;immigrant&#8221; crime!!</p>

Women who do not demand that their men protect them and their children are mentally ill.  That pretty much describes white society today.  In the 19th century men would have strung up the rapists.  In the early 20th century woman would have taken to the streets in protest.  Now they both say &#8220;what did I do wrong&#8221;?</p>

<p>Sweden is the most politically correct totalitarian state in Europe. Their definition of rape is absurb. The rest of Europe only considers rapes committed by stranger and aggravated acquaintance rape, this makes more sense than allowing any vicious deranged feminist tramp to cry rape when she changes her mind the next day about the stranger she had invited home.</p>
<p>Until we know how many rapes were committed under the more sensible laws of the rest of Europe, we cannot know the actual rather than politically correct rate of rape in Sweden.</p>
<p>In my part of the world if a stranger stalks and rapes a women, he is beheaded. If a women has sex with someone to whom she is not married, both parties are whipped.<br>

In the 19th century white women didn&rsquo;t berate white men and band together in groups to promote anything and everything that will hurt white men.</p>
<p>In the 19th century white women didn&rsquo;t use laws to extort white men for paychecks.</p>
<p>White men have become weak but only because so many white women have turned on them, laughed at them, become bored with them.</p>

		<p>The Swedes are too civilized and fair-minded to deal appropriately with this issue.  To live in a society with the rule of law means that the individual voluntarily gives up his right to use force to avenge himself and his family, yielding that right to the state.  With the rule of law, the state has a monopoly on the use of penal force and vigilanteism is not allowed.  Moreover, the fact remains that most Muslims do not rape, even though Muslims rape disproportionately.  The Swedes will not be willing to engage in collective punishment to prevent rape.  It goes against our Western notions of individual culpability and justice.  </p>
<p>Nothing will be done until the situation spirals so badly out of control that even the semblance of ordered co-existence is lost.  Only then will Swedes seek to deal with Muslims in general rather than just Muslim rapists.  </p>

		<p>Conner&hellip; You bring up a fundamental dynamic(femminism)as central to the white race&rsquo;s dilema. This true as I see it &hellip; We have been stabbed from within or from behind as such. But the equation has subtlty&rsquo;s that are requisit for proper analysis &hellip; as I see it .1. First Off in saying betrayal by our women is leading to our down fall we are kind of repeating the blaming of Eve. 2. We are also saying we were Unable to prevent our women from rebeling against us and debasing us and our racial integrity. 3. And,&hellip; why did our women become femminists? Life is a tug of war and I think its only natural that these tug of wars be internal and external as these tensions keep life viril. What seem to be localised problems sometimes have broader origins but sometimes not, we need to be thorough. The original US Patriots were rebels against Englands government, Jesus was a rebel against the established religion&hellip; Posterity has for the most part has considered these rebelions justified, then we have Judas, Brutus and the guy that betrayed the three hundred Spartans that posterity has largely condemned..And our women? </p>

		<p>Anyone who regularly surfs &#8220;conservative&#8221; blogs or websites knows full well that the majority of the rapists are Arab immigrants.  In complete fairness, however, I must point out that back when I was in Moscow 1981-1982, all the Swedish and other Scandinavian girls who frequented the &#8220;Marine Bar&#8221; on Saturday nights were absolutely fascinated by the black marines, and they all slept with as many of them as they could.</p>

		<p>I have an idea for how to solve the rape problem in Sweden. Execute all the rapists publically and deport the immigrants. If Sweden announced it was adopting a policy of executing all rapists, rape would decrease almost immediately. Non-whites take advantage of whites because whites are weak and allow them to do so. The fault lies with us. Until we are ready to get serious about non white crime it will only increase.</p>
<p>The solutions are simple unfortunately most whites don&rsquo;t have the stomach to do what they need to do in order to solve our problems. How much worse do things have to get before whites will wake up?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Just like all problems according to Nazism were automatically blamed on Jews, so all problems according to Multiculturalism are automatically blamed on whites. &#8220;</p>
<p>And since most Jews are white, they get blamed twice and often today on the pages of Amren by current posters.</p>

<p>Disagree. We White women aren&rsquo;t going around berating or trying to hurt White men. Personally, there are plenty of White men today that take advantage of the White female, especially all the men that want &#8220;friends with benfits&#8221; and no commitment. You also forget that in the 19th century, White women couldn&rsquo;t make any money because of the men at that time so if a woman lost her husband, she was up a creek without a paddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;White men have become weak but only because so many white women have turned on them, laughed at them, become bored with them.I see so many say that whites have lost their sense of race but it started with the female half and weakend the male half until the whole race became easy prey.

 Women can&rsquo;t make men weak, if men are weak, it is on them. Frankly, it&rsquo;s the &#8220;disease&#8221; of multiculuturalism that has infected both sexes. Feminisim hasn&rsquo;t weakend the western world, it simply began because of real injustices towards women in the 19th and earlier part of the 20th century, such as unequal pay for equal work etc. Racial pride is a seperate issue that has nothing to do with the sexes and the sexes have to stick together on this instead of blaming each other.</p>

<i>I can&rsquo;t think of one single benefit non-Whites have brought to Europe.</i></p>
<p>Playing the devils advocate I would say &#8216;hunger and competition&rsquo; would the main two characteristics or attributes non-Whites bring to the West.<br>
And industries who are probably experiencing a boom would be security companies, prison builders, debt collectors, translators, social workers, law enforcement, psychologists(for depressed Whites), pharmaceutical companies, employment consultants, self defense instructors, cctv installers, lawyers, all medical practitioners (especially with socialized medicine), insurance companies and depending on the quality of the immigrant maybe some taxes to be collected by our respective Governments in a generation or two to name just a few. <br>
 <br>
Unfortunately even in a disaster there is always a beneficiary or profiteer.<br>
I guess we have to look at <b>who benefits.</b></p>
<p>Here in Oz we have natural borders (Ocean), which slows down the illegals/ boat people a little, but they still come.<br>
And now we have a softer Government they are coming more constantly, but it&rsquo;s still a trickle compared to our legal migration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to work it all out myself, but a few years ago we seemed to getting lots of Iraqi&rsquo;s and now our Navy is picking up lots of  Afghani&rsquo;s, it seems where ever our military goes the locals end up being our neighbors a few years later.</p>
<p>As it&rsquo;s well documented, your illegal immigrants who are there in great no.s (20 million?) are low educated so they depress blue collar wages, so it&rsquo;s good for employers who are trying to compete globally with third world slave wages.<br>
Our immigration scheme is a little more selective taking about 180,000  people a year (@ 1.6-1.8% annual growth.)</p>
<p>25% are ex UK citizens(average age 50)= no breeding, so good for about 20 yrs.<br>
 <br>
20% from NZ= mixed bag (NZ is Oz&rsquo;s waiting room after two yrs in NZ you can move to Oz as a Kiwi, so NZ&rsquo;s new immigrants often end up here.)</p>
<p>10% Humanitarian=is supposedly an insurance policy for us and is probably our way of offsetting &#8216;crimes&rsquo; against our the indigenous peoples (who we can&rsquo;t seem to help no matter what we do), if Indonesia implodes the hope is that the rest of the World will help us with their humanitarian crisis. <br>
Also this refugee group is the group who features on our local news the most prominently for crime, they learn English the slowest and need the most financial and social assistance for their so called assimilation. <br>
Frankly, I originally assumed that they were about a third of our total immigration as they are the most visual criminal class, but it&rsquo;s actually closer to 9% of our total.</p>
<p>And the rest is a combination of the &#8216;Family and Skilled&rsquo; intake streams, family being the rest of the family being shipped from home from all other categories. <br>
And &#8216;Skilled&rsquo; being mainly young professionals with a emphasis on importing from non English speaking countries.</p>
<p>Students are basically in the same category as tourists as far as I can tell.<br>
<i>278,000 student visas were granted in the 2007-08 program year. This represents more than 21 per cent growth in the student visa program in one year.</i> <br>
(This no. represents about 1.3% of our total population http://tinyurl.com/ldfgn3 .)<br>
 <br>
Our &#8216;skilled&rsquo; stream intake actually do financially contribute to our country (they can&rsquo;t apply for welfare for the first two years of being here) and they really do pay their way.</p>
<p>But, and there is a big but.<br>
19% of our current professional class of employees here in Oz come from a Non English speaking countries. <br>
So we are usurping ourselves from both ends and the look of our country is changing fast.<br>
It&rsquo;s hard to be racially defensive, when these other groups earn more (and less) than you do and they are everywhere, in every facet of our society.<br>
In 1972 we got rid of the &#8216;White Australia policy&rsquo; (restricting Asian immigration), we recently hit one million Asian citizens in our last 2006 census. <br>
And Indians especially seem to be everywhere as I.T. managers down to convenience store clerks.<br>
And when you ask them where they come from, after being in the country for two years they will say arrogantly and shamelessly say &#8220;I am an Australian!!&#8221;<br>
They have such a sense of entitlement.</p>
<p>So we may be financially benefiting, but we are flushing our national identity down the toilet for it.<br>
The loud White sun tanned, beer drinking Australian is a thing of the past.<br>
These days we apparently drink more wine that beer and if you go to the beach you&rsquo;re an idiot who&rsquo;s going to get cancer.<br>
Between political correctness, being secular and being so scientifically well informed now we really have very little identity left to hold onto.<br>
Our HRC say outright that our national celebrations that exclude non-Whites hinder the assimilation process for non-Whites and make their job harder.<br>
So I&rsquo;m surprised that our Veteran&rsquo;s day (ANZAC day 25th April) or Independence day/Thanksgiving (Australia day 26 January) have been allowed to stay on the calendar (the latter has been rebranded as a celebration of a us being a &#8216;country of immigrant&rsquo;s&rsquo; though.) <br>
We do have a culture and it is worth preserving. <br>
And I can&rsquo;t help but feel that those who sell their souls for money deserve the low station in life that they inhabit.</p>

<p>as for that statement it makes me think of Maugwi&rsquo;s (sp?) line from the &#8220;Last of the mohiccans&#8221; about the white man being a &#8220;slave to his women&#8221; who &#8220;puts down his tomahawk to feed their laziness&#8221;.</p>
<p>Look elsewhere if you want but when you say whites have been giving away everything then that means some whites are voting against white racial interests. Then look at a group of progressives and start comparing the numbers of white women with men in that group. I did it not 2 weeks ago at a ton hall. Feminism stands strong behind the progressives so where do you think the &#8220;white&#8221; vote is coming from? How many of the male progressives are there hoping to increase their chances with the women? Which majority white political group always backs open immigration and minority &#8220;rights&#8221; it sure isn&rsquo;t the NRA.</p>

<p>&#8216;Feminist&rsquo; porn film funded by taxpayers opens in Sweden&rsquo;<br>
http://tinyurl.com/mmv2a4<br>
(I couldn&rsquo;t link the film makers site as the images there were too hardcore.)</p>
<p>We have a feminist icon who we grew here in Oz called &#8216;Germaine Greer&rsquo;( <a href="http://tinyurl.com/nwzz3t" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/nwzz3t</a> )who in 1970 wrote a book called the &#8216;The Female Eunuch,&rsquo; that became a best seller and was acclaimed by other feminazi&rsquo;s of the time as being ground breaking.<br>
Lately she makes critical comments about traditional Australian values from her London home as a celebrated academic/ author.<br>
A recent example was of her writing with zero sympathy on the Crocodiles hunters death that angered a lot of &#8216;true blue&rsquo; Ozzies. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/nzevdo" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/nzevdo</a><br>
Well the other recent applicable controversy that comes to mind is how in 2003 she had a book published called &#8216;The Beautiful Boy. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/n78vca" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/n78vca</a> <br>
When promoting this book she has made various strange statements about how she (now aged in her sixties) enjoys the romantic company of very young men and how it is some how empowering as a feminist. </p>
<p>&#8216;Generation of taboo breakers are a selfish lot&rsquo;<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/l7k8y2" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/l7k8y2</a><br>
<i>She wouldn&rsquo;t say exactly how young the &#8220;boys&#8221; are in her book but has cheerily admitted it will &#8220;get me into a lot of trouble&#8221; and expects she will be called a pedophile</i>.</p>
<p>I just find it interesting how these crusaders or barrier breakers often end up emulating the so called worse behavior of the status quo who they originally fought to dispossess.<br>
Makes me think that everyone is really just looking out for themselves and that power corrupts us all.</p>

		<p>      I see the same look of hatred on the faces of Arab Feminists as I see on our Western Ones. Yet women here were much better off. It&rsquo;s natural for women to hate men, apparently. What&rsquo;s changed is that now they have the freedom to express it fully. Does this make them happy? Does this make for a good society? No on both counts. Where did we get the idea that any and all expression of feeling is a good thing? Just like male rage has to be kept under wraps, so does female resentment. Otherwise the result is as we see-the end of our Civilization. Muslims know about this resentment, but instead of being fair, they throw the baby out with the bathwater and perpetuate a kind of slavery overy women. This is not what I call for.</p>

<p>Connor, you are confusing &#8220;feminism&#8221; with &#8220;women&#8221;.  Feminism has been badly out of touch with what women want for a generation now.  Many women authors have written about this, Christina Hoff Sommers being the most noteworthy.  The feminist elites in politics and academia do not represent most women. We are loyal to our husbands and just want a quiet life with our families.  </p>

		<p>By the way, Connor, you are quite right that feminism has taken up every politically correct cause on behalf of immigrants, minorities, gays, poor single mothers etc.  The only group they don&rsquo;t seem to advocate for anymore is your average middle-class white woman, partly because the movement was historically criticized for being too exclusive.  The movement has now been coopted and there is noone left to speak for us.</p>

<p>&gt; You&rsquo;re wrong, ALL discussion, including self-criticism of ourselves is helpful and necessary.  If I can be accused of ranting, how would you classify the usual at least 50% of the reactive posts on any Amren article?  Or do you just hate to be forced to think beyond the usual srcipts of conservatism?</p>
<p>&gt; Opening your mind to the pitfalls in generating a growing movement is helping, even if you can&rsquo;t fathom it.  The hypocrisy I intended to expose is the comparison of 2,000 years of persecution of Jews to a few decades of decline for whites.  If not hypocrisy it is hyperbole.  The further point is that posters who pop-off with their Jewish conspiracy theories here on Amren posts - and they do, I have been posting on Amren for years now - does not help attract new recruits, or attract intelligent whites who are needed for the growth of the movement.  But perhaps you have not been reading Amren articles or the posts for that long&hellip;..</p>

<p>&gt; I think I can help here.  Anyone who doubts that Feminism is behind much that has gone wrong ought to find a copy of Ex-NOW executive member Tammy Bruce and the number of books on the subject that she has written.</p>
<p>While we do not hear the same sort of ranting on the media as we did by radical feminists in the late &rsquo;60s and 70s, that does not mean that we are living in some sort of post Feminist political period with all those radical aims a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, the MSM reported that - surprise!, women are about to overcome men in employment stats.  They comprise a solid 50% now and are likely to continue to eclipse the male stat. The favority explanation is that the economy has hit typical male dominated jobs the hardest. But this is not the real story.</p>
<p>The fact is that women have over the past 40 years been able to acquire through AA and other programs, most of the middle-management jobs in the federal government and are the majority of employees in most state, county, and city position.  Men have been increasingly relegated to things like construction, sales, and truck driving.  In other words, jobs that women don&rsquo;t really want!</p>
<p>Check out any community college and you will find a pro-feminist institution.  In my own community, I it has banged up against me hard everytime I have interacted with it when I either took classes or received a service through a department.  This insttituional bias has been active in our schools and universities for so long that men are known to have been reluctant students for some years now.  The result is that less men have degrees and more women do.</p>
<p>Feminism is institutionalized now, so it doesn&rsquo;t have to go out and demonstrate.  All it has to do is continue to push for little changes here and there are they now control much of the government beauracracy.  Even women who do not necessarily think that they are Feminists take part, because they are trained early on to the normalcy of their position.  They expect to be have these in&rsquo;s and priviliges as they are the largest of all government designated &#8220;Protected Groups.&#8221;  AA has existed for so long that the culture of it has become The Establishment.</p>
<p>Some might call that fair and just.  However, if we look at the natural, biological formula for a family group&rsquo;s survival, the scenario of unemployed men and fathers, switching roles with women domestically, while men comprise 99% of troops that are killed in our military actions, we can appreciate the huge imbalance that has become so prevalent in our culture and society.  The condition is that men do the dirty jobs, the dirty, dangerous, work, while women get the cushy jobs with the most benefits because most of them are mothers too.</p>
<p>There is much more to the story, but this is how Feminism has broken up the family, turned many normal, educated, white men into dead-beat dads who can then be further prosecuted, etc. </p>
<p>Just a little pondering of this and the greater social history of the affects of Feminism ought to inform anyone.</p>
<p>But it is also true, not every woman is a feminist.  My wife, for one, is not one.  But she knows WHY she isn&rsquo;t, and that is the important part.</p>

		<p>I hate what I am about to write, but I feel I must, just to add to the perspective and truth fo the matter.</p>
<p>I have had several Swedish friends since I was 18. I have had two Swedish girlfriends as well.  The basic problem is that Swedes, like many Northern European societies are hedonists.  I had my first Swedish girlfriend in my 20s and the last one in 1996.  She was in her 30s, you would think a woman would be more grown up by then.  I remember her telling me that when she got home, she planned to get drunk with her mother.  Alcoholism is cultural for many of them.  They were both the same.  They were very attractive blondes, but they were both drunks and after the second drink, they become, very affectionate toward any male near them.  It was very hard to be with them very long.  Both liked to experiment with sex, drugs, and were mad about disco, or bar-hopping.  They both smoked cigarettes like chiminies, which I found hard to deal with as well.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go far on the internet to find Swedish women posting about non-White men.  It is not difficult to assess the attitude that they see them as play-things.  It used to be something that they could control.  However, the Swedish governments assylum programs have collided with the hedonistic nature of Swedish society. But the U.S. military bases in Greenland and Iceland have not helped either. Stil, Swedes, like many Europeans, travel a great deal more than the average American.  I have read reports by Swedish women on the internet of sex traveling to remote areas of South America to find partners that interest them. It&rsquo;s out there to read folks, and it isn&rsquo;t hard to see that they are genuine reports. </p>
<p>What has been a fun game for Swedish women has become a sort of Frankenstien Monster, and they are running from their creation.  Yes, creation.  Swedish women have been famous for dating non-Whites, and getting loads of attention for it, since the 1960s at least.  The actress, Inger Stevens made big waves when she married a black then.  Heidi Klum (I know, she&rsquo;s German, but it is the same mechanism), married the ugliest and blackest man in entertainment that she could find.  Why?, because it gets attention and therefore makes money.</p>
<p>But we can also recall the middle-aged English women and their trips to Jamaica, etc.  The usual defense is that men have always done this, so&hellip;..  Except that men have not done this at this level and it has not generated the violent crime waves as female sex hedonism.  And now it is in their own front yard, so to speak.</p>
<p>Swedish women are dying their hair, so that they won&rsquo;t be picked out on the street for harassment, or gang raped.  But as long as white women go out of dates, dance with, go to an apartment party, etc., with non-whites, she has to know that she is tempting fate. Stubborn naivity is no longer an excuse.  And perhaps that is a good thing.  Unfortunately, most people have to get hurt more than once to learn from the experience.</p>

<p>People need to take responsibility for their OWN actions. If you feel white men are not getting enough respect maybe they need to ACT like men and not wait for white women to tell them what to do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Sonya seems to suggest that white men club their women over the head and drag them off by their hair.  But didn&rsquo;t Feminists make it a crime for a man (at least a white man) to even look at a woman with obvious lust?  (Yes, that is in many companie&rsquo;s empoyee codes as sexual harassment).  Forget about whistling at one!</p>
<p>Why do white women seem to tolerate in blacks exactly what they have complained about, filed lawsuits, etc., when a white man has done it?  Today, I read that white women date blacks because white men &#8220;won&rsquo;t take charge, lack masculinity,&#8221; etc.  But Feminists have been working at emasculating men for four decades.  Also, white men harken from a culture that respected women romantically and sought to make them feel safe in their company.  The only thing that works today is agressiveness, when the woman wants it.  But our culture, the MSM, etc., all have made the &#8220;Bad Boy&#8221; the prize.  The strong, silent protector of womanhood is an anachronism.</p>
<p>The solution is nothing less than a return to chivalry, real chivalry, where women do their part and men do theirs.  But it will not happen until enough white women have been harmed and society is rocked to its knees.</p>
<p>Perhaps Feminists need to take responsibility for their actions in forming policies and promoting social attitudes that have resulted in the falling employment of males, the increased failure of marriages, and the promotion of women as the largest privileged group as a legally Protected Group?</p>
<p>Sonya, read Tammy Bruce books on the subject.  She was an executive member of NOW until she rebelled against the movement because of its hypocritical corruption. </p>
<p>In fact, I highly recommend that ALL white women read Tammy Bruce&rsquo;s books.  <br>

<p><br>
Connor, that is true enough. But the feminist movement is JUST ONE PART  of the overall anti-white  coalition.   You see it correctly, but you are looking at just one piece of the pie.  It is much bigger than feminism alone, and it didn&rsquo;t begin with feminism.   It is complex. Do you think it all began in 1960?   The roots go much deeper!  </p>
<p>Feminism was the child,  not the parent, of the movement.  Just one of the many children, that is.</p>
<p>Marxism looked around for disgruntled groups that could be agitated and exploited, split off from society,  and then  used against it.   Blacks, feminists, gays, hispanics, immigrants, Indians,  Asians&hellip;. ANYONE who could conceivably have some grudge against the majority culture that seemed to exclude them.  </p>
<p>This  strategy put the majority on the defensive and forced it to try to appease the perpetually  aggrieved minorities by making endless concessions that never seem to be enough. This coalition of  alienated &#8220;minorities&#8221; has expanded to the extent where it is now  the real majority;  and the hated former &#8220;majority&#8221; is on the run    &mdash;   backing down, groveling,  appeasing and apologizing everywhere.  </p>

<p>Feminism came about in the earlier 20th century because of the real and unfair inequities in unequal pay for equal work, lack of the vote etc. Later on, in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s, there were some seperate and individual feminist groups that aligned themselves with other interest groups, you are correct. What I&rsquo;m saying is that it is false to say that only women are responsible for this mass muliculturalism. Men are equally culpable. The 1965 Immigration Act was written and sponsored by males. Our universities etc. are full of marxist males and marxism is a male creation. Most members of Congress are male and want or allow mass illegal immigration to keep their positions in the hope that illegals will vote and most members of Big Business are male and want this so they can have cheap labor. Believe me, both males and females are to blame.</p>

That is a VERY good point made by whiteplight!   In time, these advantages become so common and ingrained that they are simply taken for granted.

<p>And too, government-instituted  programs and privileges, just like new taxes, once implemented never seem to go away   &mdash;   at least not without a lot of kicking and screaming from those who have grown accustomed to the benefits and won&rsquo;t give them up without a fight.  As the new Establishment, they have become as arrogant and smug as the old one they once railed against and displaced.  Maybe even more so!</p>

Whiteplight</i></i></p>
<p>I can distinctly remember, from way back then   &mdash;   as will anyone who is old enough to remember that era   &mdash;   how men were exhorted to be less aggressive, less forceful, and encouraged  to &#8220;get in touch with their feminine side&#8221;.  That was all the rage for quite a while. Masculinity was OUT, femininity was IN. Everything feminine was placed on a pedestal and idealized, while the evil white male became the boogey man of the new culture.</p>
<p><i>But our culture, the MSM, etc., all have made the &ldquo;Bad Boy&rdquo; the prize. The strong, silent protector of womanhood is an anachronism.</i></p>
<p>In a secure modern society, the need for that protection is not strongly felt.  And what security is needed is provided by the State.   What is desired instead is thrills and novelty.  Hedonism, as you say.   </p>
<p>But  do recall how firemen and cops   &mdash;    any strong, masculine types   &mdash;    suddenly became  briefly but extremely popular and sought after  immediately after the disaster of 9/11.  I guess that fad is long over by now. </p>

<p>Sorry but this is not true. Feminism took over and became the mother of all special interest groups. These racial minority groups do not survive without the support of Feminist groups like NOW and LWV.</p>
<p>Only the feminist followers have the numbers to truely effect the politicians. Look what happened with Obama in the primary. Or Obama&rsquo;s stimulus. Only Feminist could strong arm over 400 Billion dollars with a few emails and phone calls.</p>
<p>When you see something like Obama getting 43% of the white vote he got that vote from the feminist lobby or a special interest group supported by that lobby who directed their members to vote for him. They did so because feminism has done good by them this far it must be the right thing for them to do again. Most had no clue of the actual politics they go with who brought them.</p>
<p>Are there women out there who are not feminist? Sure there are some and I salute and would defend each and every one of them BUT they are not the problem nor are they a majority of the white women out there.</p>
<p>Take my girl friend for example she voted for Obama, why? Because the women at her office all NOW members said to and she did it before I could show her why she shouldn&rsquo;t. I work in a large factory every white woman there admitted openly to voting for Obama, every white man said they didnt. Ok there was one very Christian lady who didn&rsquo;t as well. One out of about 100.</p>
<p>Alot of women say they are not feminist but when the time comes for them to use the special benefits that feminism has given them they don&rsquo;t think twice.</p>
<p>Feminism is what is killing white racial unity and is destroying Europe, Australia and the US.</p>
<p>If all those women who supported and paid for NOW stood behind white men no other special interest minority would stand a chance. Until we defeat it every white male has a target on his back placed there by white women.</p>
<p>as a matter of fact it was the radical feminist that screamed so hard to &#8220;Free South Africa&#8221; back in the day. I remember them with the signs standing next to the black protesters. They sacrificed those whites for their cause and they will sacrifice the white men who remain. We are the easiest target and it makes them look good to aim at us.</p>

<p>So you have a hard time understanding why unwanted sexual advances in the workplace are prohibited? Do you really not understand why that is the case? Because people (even women) need their jobs,  they can&rsquo;t just walk out when they feel uncomfortable. Staring/leering at female coworkers is extremely inappropriate; anyone with common sense would know that. You seem to think you have a right to treat your female coworkers in a disrespectful, possibly even hostile manner. You are the reason those laws were put into place.</p>
<p>If you want to lust after women and make them uncomfortable feel free to do it in a PUBLIC place where they can tell you what they think of your behavior, or simply leave your presence. <br>

		<p>Sonya, Whiteplight:</p>
<p>I lean towards Sonya on this one.  Ogling isn&rsquo;t prohibited where I work per se, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to test it.  Also, even if there were no consequences, it is something I wouldn&rsquo;t do anyway.  I wouldn&rsquo;t ogle for the same reason I don&rsquo;t do office politics, office gossip, nor do I make close friends of any of my co-workers.  The reason is that we&rsquo;re there to do a job, not to goof off.  Ogling, gossiping and relationships only serve to hinder actual work.  Personally, I would make office gossiping a capital crime.</p>
<p>And certainly, I don&rsquo;t make friends of my supervisors because I don&rsquo;t make enemies with my supervisors, and I don&rsquo;t make enemies with my supervisors because I don&rsquo;t make friends with my supervisors.  They&rsquo;re bosses, not friends or enemies.  A boss is the total diametric opposite of a friend or enemy.</p>
<p>Not that what I&rsquo;m about to say matters to me right now, as I recently transferred to a different position with the same institution, the old one was heavily women, my new one is almost all men, but if I met and fell in love with a woman that worked under the same immediate supervisor as I did, or close enough, either she would find a new job or I would.</p>

I&rsquo;m male, and I also agree with Sonya on this one.  Leering at ANYONE with lust in your eye is totally out of place in the workplace.  There&rsquo;s no reason why any well-run company should allow it.  It&rsquo;s supposed to be a place of business, not a pick up bar.  If I were running a business, I wouldn&rsquo;t allow it either.  It&rsquo;s a distraction fron the job, and often makes others uncomfortable as well.  Let those horny individuals make their pick ups elsewhere.  When they&rsquo;re at work, they&rsquo;re supposed to be thinking about work.  There&rsquo;s a time and place for everything. </p>

<p><br>
It&rsquo;s not just looks, and It&rsquo;s not only females who are made uncomfortable.   Who wants to work around someone who&rsquo;s always on the make?   Whose every remark is a suggestive one.  Whose mind is constantly on sex.  Blacks are worst about this, especially their indecent language, but some whites are pretty bad too.   As I look back over the years, I can think of at least four or five persons who stand out, scattered over time  (men, and one woman) who engaged in the most extremely uninhibited sexual talk   &mdash;   no topic tabooed!   &mdash;    lewd conversations which made many people around feel very uncomfortable.  Who wants to hear all the details about someone&rsquo;s sex life, or his speculations about someone else&rsquo;s?   These conversations did not belong in the workplace.</p>
<p>No one, including me, ever spoke up  but it was often very embarrassing.  Some people just don&rsquo;t seem to know any better,  have no inhibitions or social sense.  Unfortunately that why we have to have laws.  Laws are for those  fools who don&rsquo;t know how to behave properly on their own and have to be regulated.  If everyone behaved responsibly, we wouldn&rsquo;t need any  rules or laws at all.</p>
<p>I also feel that those individuals knew  very well what they were doing and took advantage of the fact that others felt cornered, couldn&rsquo;t get away, and were too embarrassed to complain or say anything. To have spoken up would have meant getting into an argument and making an enemy.  So, like a naughty child, they pushed it as far as they could go, knowing their advantage.   Everyone just put up with it, but silence did not mean agreement.</p>

		<p>I have read all the comments on this post carefully. I really think that FEMINISM was a disaster for women. Whatever benefits women gained in the workplace and in employment opportunities were more then cancelled out by one other, perhaps unforeseen consequence of their actions - the emasculation of White men. White women lost their traditional protectors and providers.</p>

<p>Close but not quite.  The rapists there are likely to be <i>dusky </i>Moslems.  Dusky to dark.  Not  really white though. The place is full of Arabs, of varying shades.   (And true, many Bosnians, Kurds, etc. as well, some of whom are white, but not quite Swedish white.)   Most of the Arabs though not black,  are not exactly &#8220;white&#8221; either.  They are sallow-skinned and far less white than the fair-skinned Swedes. You can instantly tell the difference. Same with the Turks, Afghans, Pakis, etc.</p>
<p>But still, many other immigrants most definitely ARE black. And not all Somalis/Ethiopians are little, skinny shrimps either, although they do tend to be small and lightweight.  (And, yes, there ARE plenty of blacks from elsewhere, though not the majority of immigrants.)   Maybe you don&rsquo;t see that many around the tourist areas of Stockholm (just as with Paris), but there are whole areas, especially in the suburbs and the housing projects which are taken over by immigrants.  And Gothenburg?  Malmo?  Have you ridden the Stockholm subway?  It&rsquo;s full of them.  </p>

		<p>Well this thread is about to fall off into archive neverland.</p>
<p>It was a worthwhile discussion. Not pointedly at the topic but into more of why white men in general cannot really defend the white female victims of these racial attacks.</p>
<p>I understand white women who are race aware are defensive of feminism. But these gains they have gotten have been at the expense of white men.</p>
<p>I saw that harrassment at work was brought up, yet how many times have I witnessed a woman tell a joke then complain with dire results when a man told the same joke a week later where she could hear it?</p>
<p>How can we give huge bonuses to companies and agencies to hire everyone but white men and not bring the race down? Sure the white women still benefit but the sinking lack of support and lack of worthiness effects these same white women sooner or later through the men who are close to them unless these women choose to leave the white race behind which all too many have done.</p>
<p>These pro-female laws and legislations do not touch the non-white men&hellip; Ladies remember that. To the present day lesbian and race neutral leaders of feminist groups attacking white men is just another way for them to get more power. If these groups have left you behind then it is time to start fighting against them. Until feminist groups are brought down the white race will continue to decline.</p>

<p>Did you know that there is actually an immigrant dialect called Rinkeby Swedish?  <br>
  &#8220;Rinkeby Swedish (Rinkebysvenska) is a common term for varieties of Swedish spoken mainly in suburbs with a high proportion of immigrants and immigrant descendants. &#8221;  [Wiki]  There is even a magazine (at least one) published in this &#8220;language&#8221;. </p>
<p>It is found largely &hellip;&#8221;in  suburbs of Stockholm, Malmö, and Gothenburg with a large immigrant dominance.&#8221;<br>
It contains many loanwords from &hellip;mainly Turkish, with traces of Kurdish, Arabic, Greek, Persian, Serbo-Croatian, Syriac, and to some extent Latin American Spanish.    <br>
There is also an influx of English   due to  <b><i>a common identification with African Americans and the appreciation of rap and hip hop music and culture. </i></b><br>
