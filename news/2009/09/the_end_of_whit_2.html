			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ruben Navarrette Jr., San Diego Union-Tribune, January 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What is it with white males? You would think that a group that occupies so many powerful positions and controls so much wealth would be secure enough not to be rattled by a few silly comments. But in the aftermath of the inauguration of the first African American president, skins are thin. It&rsquo;s a new day  &mdash;  one in which, as some people see it, white males are both convenient villains and our society&rsquo;s newest victims.</p>
<p>Even the fact that white males are overrepresented in the Obama White House staff and Cabinet doesn&rsquo;t do much to reassure them that they haven&rsquo;t lost their place at the head of the line. And now some in the blogosphere and on talk radio seem to be cracking under the pressure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What set [Michael] Savage off were comments by former Labor Secretary Robert Reich who, in testifying before Congress on President Obama&rsquo;s plan to create more than a million new jobs as part of the economic recovery, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am concerned, as I&rsquo;m sure many of you are, that these jobs not simply go to high-skilled people who are already professionals or to white male construction workers. I have nothing against white male construction workers, I&rsquo;m just saying that there are other people who have needs as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, Reich, who is today a UC Berkeley professor, could have chosen his words better. But the former Clinton administration official was making a serious point about expanding opportunities for those who sometimes miss out. Naturally, &#8220;white male construction workers&#8221; should not be singled out or excluded from the recovery. But nor should Reich have been vilified as some kind of racist  &mdash;  not just by Savage but by more than a dozen other radio hosts and bloggers who took offense.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>  &mdash;  After watching Obama&rsquo;s inauguration, CNN&rsquo;s Larry King announced that his 8-year-old son Cannon &#8220;now says that he would like to be black.&#8221; As King noted, &#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of advantages to being black. Black is in.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  During an interview that took place just moments after Obama was sworn in, comedian Chris Rock joked with the white male interviewer. &#8220;Can I just hit you right now?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny if I just punched you in the face right about now? If I just walked around here, smacking white people. He&rsquo;s president. Pow!&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Appearing on MSNBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Morning Joe&#8221; on Inauguration Day, Tom Brokaw said: &#8220;Having been in the South in the &rsquo;60s and Los Angeles and Watts and Northern urban areas, umm, uh, when we were evolving as a country  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m thinking of all the bigots and the rednecks and all the people that I met along the way, and I&rsquo;m saying to them, &#8216;Take this.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Even the Atlantic magazine offered up the article &#8220;The End of White America?&#8221; It concluded: &#8220;As a purely demographic matter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8216;white America&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may cease to exist in 2040, 2050 or 2060, or later still. But where the culture is concerned, it&rsquo;s already all but finished. Instead of the long-standing model of assimilation toward a common center, the culture is being remade in the image of white America&rsquo;s multiethnic, multicolored heirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These worries are a waste of time. This is still a country of limitless opportunities where anyone can succeed  &mdash;  as long as they don&rsquo;t spend all their energy coming up with excuses for failing.</p>

		<p>Relax!  You still have plenty of time.  No need to get rambunctious.  Just lie back and be still.  It takes a &#8220;real man&#8221; to embrace change.</p>
<p>With 307 million people in the US, 200 million of which are non-hispanic Whites, we are 65% of the population.  Now this is not including the probably at least 20 million illegals.  Factor them into the equation and we are more like 61% of the population.</p>
<p>61 percent.</p>
<p>No indications have shown that any illegals are going to be forcibly deported.  <br>
No indications have shown that the government will make it difficult for them to be here, so difficult that they will leave on their own.<br>
Most indications are that Obama will lead the way towards amnesty.<br>
All indications are that the illegals will continue to flood in at even greater rates than they&rsquo;re flooding in now. </p>
<p>Folks, the prediction that we are going to be a minority in 2042 is a fantasy.  It&rsquo;s meant to instill in us a false sense of security, a sense that we have &#8220;plenty of time&#8221;.  We don&rsquo;t.  We&rsquo;re going to be a minority in the next 15 years or so; in the early to mid 2020&rsquo;s.  That prediction is far more accurate.  </p>
<p>The time is fast approaching.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it Elizabeth Wright who said everyone has something to lose with the loss of White America?  The fact of the matter is&hellip; whites + America is one in the same.  America won&rsquo;t be America without whites.  We have all seen the start of the fall in the past few decades..  When blacks, browns, and even yellows start really controlling things, the country will morph into the nations they left behind.  Whether its America or Canada or Europe or Australia, all will cease to exist without the founding stock.  America will rot away.  And, they will be back at square one.</p>
<p>And, we won&rsquo;t go down without a fight.  And the fact is&hellip; most of these folks have never had to fight us&hellip; yet.<br>

<p>Oh, I get it.  I&rsquo;m secretly a wealthy corporate CEO and I live in a mansion.  That I live in a small apartment, drive a 9-year old compact car and have a job that pays in the low five figures, a job where I have to be purer than Caesar&rsquo;s wife and the wind driven snow combined because some affirmative action junkies higher up are looking for the flimsiest excuse to can a white man, is just a figment of my imagination.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;This is still a country of limitless opportunities where anyone can succeed&#8221;  A fundamental question to ask would be &#8220;WHY is America a nation where anyone can succeed?&#8221;  Is it something in the soil?  Is it a magic ingredient in the soil?  Did God look down at His atlas and give His blessings to the geographical area located within these borders just on a whim?  No, not at all.  It was the PEOPLE who made America what it is.  Specifically, it was white Western Europeans who made this nation what it is.  That is the magic formula and how do we know this?  Everywhere white Western Europeans have settled, built a society and been the majority - voila! - that region is a &#8220;country of limitless opportunities&#8221;. Whether it&rsquo;s Britain, New Zealand, Australia or (formerly) South Africa, those lands are immigration magnets.  No matter how fertile, sunny, or mineral-rich other lands are, if they are not ruled by whites from Western Europe, they are not desirable places to be.  People don&rsquo;t become &#8220;Americans&#8221; just be crossing the Rio Grande or even by taking an oath.  They certainly don&rsquo;t become &#8220;American&#8221; just by being born here.  They are American by virtue of their race, culture and heritage.  When we try mass producing &#8220;Americans&#8221;, we end up ruining America and it will revert to a filthy wasteland that resembles most of the rest of the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;White males&#8221; are over-represented?  They are?  Well, as has often been discussed here on Amren, that largely depends on how you define &#8220;white&#8221;.  There is no single, agreed-upon definition.  Obviously, this naive Mexican writer sees all whites as one solid monolithic group, but that is erroneous and a matter of opinion. Not all of us would agree. After all, are we not entitled (like all other groups) to define ourselves? We do not need a Mexican journalist to tell us who we are.</p>

		<p>     &#8220;It&rsquo;s still a country of opportunities - -.&#8221; If the playing field were level, I would agree. Minorities and third- worlders are given advantages that the natives do not get. I could create a business too if I got a no-interest loan from Uncle Sap. What other freebies does the government hand out to these people that the rest of us do not get ? </p>

		<p>I wonder if we went to Mexico and took jobs and got on welfare roles how they would feel. Their failure is manifested in the countries they hail from Mexico and Africa. They can glee about the white man all they want but this society like the ones they can&rsquo;t build will fail. </p>
<p>Whites need to get a grip this isn&rsquo;t about fairness about the dispossed black man or mexican they can&rsquo;t stand each other anyway. Their common hatred of whites is enough for now but that will change. There failure as a people will manifest itself soon enough. </p>
<p>As a people whites are just now waking up to he facts. This whole affirmative action it&rsquo;s our turn thing is about getting rid of whites. As I have hoped for many years we could end this once and for all in a way that would fix our friend Chris Rock but good. </p>

		<p>The enormous irony of the question is based on the  under 90 IQ of the Latino or their inability to understand the logic:</p>
<p>1. the land around now state New Mexico and down formerly belonged to Mexicans and it was a desert where Mexicans did not want to live. <br>
2. since white people got a part of the land, they turned the desert into a paradise called state New Mexico, where Mexicans love to live and want it back.<br>
3. the part remained  under Latinos is still a desert where Latinos hate to live.<br>
3. after Latinos get the land back in a shortest time there will be a desert again.</p>
<p>Why?<br>
Because it is the white man who turns a desert into paradise.<br>
Because it is the Latino and African who turns any land into a desert. </p>
<p>So! Where do Latinos are going to move after?  </p>

		<p>Without innovation and smart domestic manufacturing there are no limitless opportunites. Just a slow decline into what Mexico is today. Are Latinos going to step up and innovate and manufacture like 19th and 20th century Americans did? I can find no indication that they ever have, are, or ever will. </p>

<p><br>
There is this small thing that while all whites are caucasians, all caucasians arent white. The US is 65% caucasian, it isnt 65% white. Its actually only about 50% white and some of these whites are certainly high yella mestisos. So I would say that the turnover point is Right Now. Its quite fitting that it happens under a black presidumbt, isnt it. Anyway, the population estimates for 2050 is for a population of about 450-550 million, noone can say exactly, but if we have about 150 million whites today well have perhaps 120 million by 2050 because white birth rates are negative and there are no foreign white immigrant sources to drain from. Its thus not farfetched to claim that by 2050 there will be approximatively 20% whites in the USA. By 2100 the white population in the US will be around 0%, possibly some all white areas will exist in the cold hinterlands in minnesota but by then the white minority should have been assimilated into mestisos of some kind. They will still consider themselves whites, but they will be more like north africans than europeans. </p>

		<p> The average white person will wake up and realise that they are hated due to the color of their skin just before death is delivered at the hands of a nonwhite.<br>
 The white race (as a whole) will never wake up and realize that they are hated simply due to their skin color.<br>
 Like the Jews of Germany during the 1920&rsquo;s that ignored the ravings of the little man in the beerhalls of Munich with the funny mustache; 10 years later; it was too late. Millions died, herded into the death chambers and slaughtered like cattle.<br>
 This is the fate of the white race.We are not allowed to stand together for our own self interest, school our children the way we see fit,organize groups to benefit the white race,the media portrays whites as buffoons and total idiots, and last but not least; white women are labeled racist if they do not date, marry and bear the children of other races!<br>
 The end of the white race? I agree; as long as the government mandated religion of political correctness rules the land, when the deaths of thousands of whites at the hands of other races make nothing more than the local news; yet the death of a 16 year old black at the hands of another black makes the headlines for a week,then the white race no longer considers itself worthy of continued existance and should not only allow itself to be exterminated but help their executioner in any way possible to expedite the process.</p>

		<p>Navarette&rsquo;s columns used to run in my local paper. Surprise, surprise, he could always be counted on to take the pro-Hispanic point of view.</p>
<p>But I find it funny that Navarette poo-poohs the idea that whites could have any concerns about the demographics of this country, but then he quotes from the Atlantic magazine about the decline of white America without even bothering to question it.</p>
<p>Put it this way. Say you have a fine timepiece. Would you say to yourself, &#8220;This is a fine timepiece. I think I&rsquo;ll open it up, rearrange a few gears, and no doubt have a far finer device.&#8221; That would be foolish. </p>
<p>The United States has done pretty well over the past 200 years, and yet there are some who think that irrevocably changing it without any real thought or consideration is a fine idea. And no one is supposed to object to this???</p>
<p>On the plus side, the fact that Navarette feels obliged to write about this subject shows that more and more people may be waking up.</p>

		<p>Is there anything more ludicrous than Non-Whites lecturing Whites about having a &#8220;thin-skin&#8221; and the like? The mind-boggling hypocrisy is outweighed only by the sheer gall of such assertions. Self-awareness is utterly lacking in Non-Whites - utterly!</p>

		<p>Staying silent and being timid isn&rsquo;t doing much for white folks. Mr Navarrette seems concerned that could change. He doesn&rsquo;t want to hear a peep. But what if the labor secretary said more or less the same thing, except going on about how he&rsquo;s afraid new jobs might go to Hispanic construction workers? The construction trades don&rsquo;t seem to look like the rest of America to me. What if this was the important message? I wonder if Mr Navarrette would call opposition to This idea and initiative plain old bigotry? </p>
<p>I seriously wonder if these media people are being paid to be clueless. It almost seems as if they are in some kind of contest. </p>

		<p>again, my apologies for lack of cap&rsquo;s and certain punctuation d/t faulty keyboard.</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t add much to what has already been said in earlier posts, many of them said quite eloquently.<br>
predictions on what will happen to america with a rising tide of color but are many in number but one thing is for sure&hellip;with a majority non-white population, the good ol&rsquo; u.s.a. as we know it will be gone forever.<br>
a book could be written - and many have been - on this subject. </p>
<p>contrary to what mr. navarrette says, &#8221;limitless opportunity&#8221; and all that jazz is garbage. as the white population ceases to be a majority i can see no good that will come as a result. the focus i think should be on the reasons why we are headed down.<br>
1. passage of the &#8221;immigration reform act of 1965&#8221; was by far the most destructive long-term legislation that has ever been passed by congress. this uber-liberal anti-white bill passed through congress with the heavy endorsement of none other than our pal teddy kennedy. i was too young to really realize the significance of it at the time, but from what i can read, it was passed in the mid-&#8216;60&rsquo;s, when liberalism was running amok.<br>
kennedy made a short speech to america and to congress and continually assured everyone who would listen that it &#8221;would not -repeat would not - change the existing demographic of the u.s.,&#8221; which was 89.2 percent white in 1965. america was so caught up in the civil rights movement and the liberal l.b.j. administration and it just seemed like the &#8221;right&#8221; thing to do. after all, look who was endorsing it. the brother of our late &#8221;beloved&#8221; president, j.f.k. so it passed without much fanfare. it wasn&rsquo;t given much press and no one really batted an eye. now, 44 years later we know that someone like joe wilson should have interrupted his speech with a &#8221;you lie&#8221; when he said it wouldn&rsquo;t change our current demographic. he was indeed lying and now we pretty much know that he knew he was lying when he made the statement so many years ago.<br>
2. our confounded porous southwestern border continues to leak mexicans who have no intention of assimilating. many females are pregnant and will have shortly what&rsquo;s known as &#8221;anchor babies.&#8221; this is an archaic law that has outlived its usefullness and should have been abolished long ago.<br>
on second thought, our porous southwestern border will probably prove to be our undoing faster than the immigration reform act. the hemorrhaging of hostile mexicans - many of whom are violent criminals with long records - will prove to be more destructive and faster. <br>
what will happen as a result of all this. it&rsquo;s hard to say, but i think some sort of break-up or balkanization is indeed probable. i will direct anyone interested to a book called &#8221;civil war ll; the coming balkanization of america&#8221; by thomas chittom. i have it and read it around 10 years ago. many of mr. chittom&rsquo;s predictions have come to pass since that time.<br>
i blame clinton for not doing something during the &#8216;90&rsquo;s when he saw illegal immigration was clearly out of control. he made some glowing remarks near the end of his second term about how whites were going to be a &#8221;minority&#8221; near mid-century that let me know he approved of the &#8216;migration&rsquo;. after all, these were to be future democratic voters. our last election showed us that many of our western states like colorado and nevada are now no longer predictably &#8216;red&rsquo; d/t the burgeoning hispanic population.</p>
<p>i hope i have added some historical perspective as to how we got to where we are and why. </p>

<p>Great post, but more likely our grandchildren will be asking us, in Spanish, &#8220;Boy, Grandma or Grandpa, it must&rsquo;ve been awful living in the US when evil whites like us were the majority!  You must&rsquo;ve seen blacks lynched and Latinos beaten up on the streets each and every day!

I hope I can find a wonderful black or Latino person willing to shack up with me and have kids with me, despite my disgusting race.  Of course, we&rsquo;ll have to live with you, even though there&rsquo;s already five people living in your apartment.  Oh, and can I borrow the bicycle to go get in line at the government center?

		<p>History shows that Europeans can do amazing things - unfortunately this includes wrecking the planet and dispossessing themselves.</p>
<p>When whites have had enough, they will organize and vote and shift things. </p>
<p>The US will never be 99% white, but we can reverse the decline:</p>
<p>1) close the borders</p>
<p>2) do not subsidize the births of low IQ immigrants (or low IQ whites either!!!!)</p>
<p>3) whites need to reproduce at replacement rate or above</p>
<p>4) no race/ethnic quotas: don&rsquo;t subsidize incompetence</p>
<p><br>
We have to make the US less hospitable to incompetent foreigners.</p>
<p>By the way: does anyone here actually believe &#8220;leftists &#8221; have created open immigration?</p>
<p>As Steve Sailer points out, it was LABOR &amp; the left who fought open borders tooth and nail in the 19th &amp; early 20th centuries - against big capital, which wanted open borders and an unlimited labor pool.</p>
<p>We need a new politics, a total realignment.</p>

		<p>Navarrette is an AA-promoted angry hispanic columnist spewing unchallenged hate against Whites.  </p>
<p>Seems he, like so many others of his ilk, is happy to use WHITE technology to  denounce and condemn WHITES from WHITE-created institutions.  Seems those hated WHITES innovations and institutions have made his life very cushy and comfortable  &mdash;  something HIS people, with their low IQs, will never be able to do. </p>
<p>He is a merely a tool of the hostile elites in the media whose main goal is race replacement of Whites, up to and including elimination.  He fits their bill perfectly as they pass around and syndicate his rants and protect him and his screeds by refusing to print rebuttals.</p>
<p>One writer at V.Dare complained:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Since Ruben Navarrette  arrived at the Union-Tribune, my letters stopped appearing. Navarrette and Letters Editor Henry Fuentes object to my frank talk about Mexican immigration</p>
<p>Navarrette and Fuentes are on the Union-Tribune editorial board&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>No White Should Support ANY mainstream paper that allows unchallenged bashing of Whites.   This is another instance where the Internet has set us free from the White-hating msm.</p>
<p>As for navarrette&rsquo;s home paper the San Diego Union-Tribune:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the U-T has been plagued by poor morale and severe financial troubles in recent years. The paper has physically shrunk by about half since 2006, and several rounds of layoffs and buyouts have eliminated about half of all jobs companywide. Three rounds of layoffs targeted the newsroom alone. It lost some of its biggest and most well-respected names&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems like the White readers of the U-T are tired of the U-T&rsquo;s leftist tripe.</p>
<p>You can bet their racist hispanic house writer will not be cut.</p>
<p>Let us hope the White readership will put them out of business by refusing to spend money or do business with a paper that treats them like garbage.  This paper will go down in flames.</p>

		<p>This guy&rsquo;s article can be torn to shreds logically in a dozen places at least.  But let me just point out that when he refers to &#8220;white males,&#8221; he&rsquo;s referring to the entire white population.  It&rsquo;s pure and simple racism that shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed in any publication, unless they allow us Amrenners equal space.</p>
<p>This is just more of the same white insults that are hurled daily with impunity, and that will continue unless whites get up off their butts and start raising holy Hell.</p>
<p>The tea party crowd has shown more guts than any white group so far, and their numbers in D.C. were dramatic. These are just two.  New groups with other names are springing up everywhere. And there are an increasing number of blogs who seemed to have popped up from out of nowhere.  Also, I notice that the Council of Conservative Citizens is getting more traffic, and they are becoming more active.  I have no way of knowing, but I&rsquo;m guessing Amren has seen an upsurge in members and viewers of this web site.  I&rsquo;m noticing more unfamiliar handles as well as Anon postings.  Whites ARE becoming more active.  </p>
<p>This Obama presidency has created what many said would happen:  Racism against whites is being noticed more, and white unity is actually beginning to take hold.</p>
<p>If it ever flowers out to its full potential, those like this Mexican are going to be told to keep their mouths shut in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>To those who want whites to fight back, if you just complain and don&rsquo;t act, then you have NO RIGHT to complain. </p>
<p>If all you can do is write letters, that&rsquo;s better than nothing.</p>

<p>For once Ruben has it right, &#8220;why worry.&#8221;  The countries involved will devolve into third world hell holes just as the countries we now view as such.  Most of which are countries the immigrants are escaping now.  Finances will disappear and the tax base our thieving politicans clamor for incessantly will be gone.</p>
<p>Do you actually beleive the replacements for the whites will have the same productivity, the same genius for invention, and the same work ethics?  Remember, whites didn&rsquo;t need reverse discrimination for their jobs or school grades.  That only applies to our replacements.</p>
<p>The American people have allowed this to happen over the past 60 years on a daily basis, we have seen the lies and shenanigans played endlessly, and too many of our race want to suffer.</p>
<p>Ruben, you never would have been employed by Dallas newspapers on merit, it was all about your ethnicity.

<p>If you are young enough to create a family, then do so. Don&rsquo;t waste your money on pop culture nonsense or flashy consumption.</p>

<p>White America will cease to exist in next 20 years; not only white America we will also be joined by most of the European nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most? Jdavis, Europe isnt just Western Europe. Sure, France is going to be below 50% whites for sure, but not Germany (yet), not Denmark, not Sweden, not Austria. White people in Europe are a bit different than white people in USA. People here have a common history that goes back 1000&rsquo;s of years. They have a very well defined identity of what and who they are, how they are supposed to look, how they are supposed to behave and so on. </p>
<p>Americans seem to think that the holocaust was a singular event in European history - it is not. Europe is a very dangerous place when the natives embark on a rampage. The first jews were pogromed 1200 years ago!</p>
<p>The ethnically homogenous nation state was invented in Europe because the monstrous slaughter during the 30 years war, when the population of Germany was reduced by almost 70%. It was recognized that ethnically homogenous nation states would not descend into the kind of extremely brutal civil war (brutal because in a civil war you are fighting for yourself and your family, and you can bet that the soldiers do a good job of killing if they work for themselves). </p>
<p>Today the wisdom from that era has been rejected and Europe is transitioning into a powder keg. The breakup of Yugoslavia showed that the old wisdom was indeed old wisdom and not old tripe, and it is pretty clear by now that the next European war wont be the russians invading but rather a large and very nasty pan-european civil war. A three cornered war too, between natives, immigrants and repesentatives for the old order - read US marines/rangers and other UN riffraff. Thats why its positive for the natives of Europe if USA becomes a dysfunctional 3rd world nation without supercarriers or LHDs. </p>

<p>&#8220;By the way: does anyone here actually believe &#8216;leftists&rsquo; have created open immigration?&#8221;</p>
<p>I most certainly do. Of course, more precisely this is the result of an unholy convergence of goals of big business and the left. Business supports it for economic reasons, but the left supports it for more insidious ideological reasons. Most obviously they do it to have more potential voters in the future that will support them. It&rsquo;s a brilliant electoral strategy on their part, as we saw in the last election.</p>
<p>However, the commitment of the left to open borders runs far deeper than this. Non-whites are the new proletariat in the minds of the cultural Marxists (and the cultural Marxists are the brains behind much of current left-wing philosophy). Non-whites are the means by which the radical leftists will finally bring down capitalist Western civilization, which has been their goal all along. The promotion of redistribution of people and of wealth is part of their larger radical egalitarian plans. This stems in part from the larger shift that occurred in the 1930s and beyond when many Marxists wondered why revolutions all over the world did not occur on the heels of the Russian Revolution. Marx, after all, had predicted this as the inevitable thrust of history. To salvage Marxism it had to be reinvented, hence the shift to Gramscian notions of &#8220;cultural hegemony&#8221; and a new shift to &#8220;cultural&#8221; Marxism (rather than the economic determinism of Marx). The key now to destroying capitalism was not class revolution, but the successfully waged culture war. Add to this the calls of some American Marxists in the 1930s (Lewis Corey for example) for fellow radicals to appropriate what was later called the cultural apparatus and the ascendancy of Frankfurt School ideas in universities during the radical &rsquo;60s and you can see how and why leftists took control of the influential media and educational systems. </p>
<p>Since &#8220;revolution&#8221; is now about gradually shifting cultural hegemony to the left through these Marxist-dominated institutions (think here about the ascendancy of PC or even &#8220;whiteness studies,&#8221; perpetuated by academics and the media), the culture of a nation or groups of people in that nation are the key to radical change. The culture and economic structures built by white Americans are what the Marxists perceive as standing in their way to an egalitarian utopia. What better way to destroy Western culture than to dilute and minimize the power, size, and significance of the people that hold that culture? Hence, massive immigration of people who do not hold native values or perpetuate the same culture. </p>
<p>Open borders is fundamental to the leftist project. How else do they assure that they win in the end? (Of course, they won&rsquo;t really win with Mexicans and Muslims but that&rsquo;s another topic&hellip;) No American proletariat is going to rise up with pitchforks to overthrow the capitalists after all and conservative whites are outbreeding the left-wing ones. In the end, this is largely about bringing down Western Civ, since it is a big roadblock to the institution of a radical egalitarian society. This too is, of course, the reason why not only the numbers of immigrants have changed but also the nature of immigration has shifted (i.e., multiculturalism instead of integration as the goal). Spend some time among academics and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean by all this.</p>

With the birtrates of blacks and hispanics being what it is, white children don&rsquo;t have a chance. Not a single chance. I feel sorry for these kids. We did this to them by not being active at town hall meetings. Instead we lie on a sofa with a six pack watching football games.<b></b></b></p>
<p>or we spend lots of $$$ to talk to a shrink about how we feel and our young white men spend too much time &#8220;getting in touch with their feminine inside&#8221; and having self-loating for their ancestors.  Oh, and we have lots of interracial dating between whites and non-whites these days.  </p>

<p>Europeans may have had a well defined identity but they have become inflicted with the same disease of multiculturalism as have those in North America. Europe, especially western Europe, has huge numbers of Muslims and others with very high birthrates and the EU wants to bring in Africans and more. Individual european countries will be and are being overwhelmed more quickly than the USA due to their smaller size. I&rsquo;ve been in europe and their are huge numbers of muslims and non-Whites in most cities and many europeans have the same attitude as many Americans, embracing this. If things don&rsquo;t change in 50 years, a large part of europe with be  majority non-White or have very sizeable minorities of non-Whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thats why its positive for the natives of Europe if USA becomes a dysfunctional 3rd world nation without supercarriers or LHDs.&#8221;</p>
<p>No it won&rsquo;t be. Currently the USA spends billions on defense in Europe and has indirectly provided defence for the last 60 years and trades with Europe. A 3rd world dysfunctional USA means Europe will spend more on defense, lack USA protection and lose money with trade, stocks etc. Consequently, a 3rd world Arabian europe will also be a threat to the USA and cost the USA economically.</p>

<p>They may go to the colleges but they are not citizens and are there temporarily. Mexico would NEVER allow millions of Whites into their county illegally or legally for that matter, give them citizenship, free medical, schooling, Spanish-as-a-second lanugage, put up with crime etc.</p>

		<p>Anonymous, I would imagine JJ means the millions of ethnic Spaniards and other Europeans that were born in Mexico. About 10% of Mexico&rsquo;s population is typically classified as white. We don&rsquo;t usually see them because they pretty much run Mexico and tend to be well off; thus, no reason to migrate to the US. Take a look at Mexican movies and TV shows. Most of their actors look nothing like the mestizo Mexicans we see in this country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you are right, though, that large-scale mass immigration of whites from abroad would never be tolerated, just as immigration of Central Americans is not tolerated now. There are a fair number of Americans living in Mexico right now, but they are not afforded the same rights as the native populations (and are certainly not given all the handouts that the American taxpayers hand over to Mexicans in the US).</p>

		<p><i>Oh, I get it. I&rsquo;m secretly a wealthy corporate CEO and I live in a mansion. That I live in a small apartment, drive a 9-year old compact car and have a job that pays in the low five figures, a job where I have to be purer than Caesar&rsquo;s wife and the wind driven snow combined because some affirmative action junkies higher up are looking for the flimsiest excuse to can a white man, is just a figment of my imagination.</i></p>
<p>Heh heh&hellip;shall we meet at the country club? You make a good point. Minority activists look at the small fraction of Whites who hold positions of power while ignoring the vast majority who are being dispossessed of their neighborhoods and jobs and culture. They also overlook the fact that Whites in power promote an anti-White agenda via everything from affirmative action to opening the borders to illegal immigration. </p>
<p>This is why I can not get worked up over Obama in the White House. What can he do that has not already been done by the Bushes, Clintons, Kennedys, ad nauseam? </p>

<p>Having just spent August in Scandinavia, I&rsquo;m not so sure that you can include Sweden.  It&rsquo;s slipping fast, but Denmark appears even  worse!  Nobody who&rsquo;s  recently been in Copenhagen could possibly say, &#8220;not Denmark&#8221;.  If only that were so!</p>
<p>Also they have much smaller populations than France or Germany and could be overwhelmed very easily    &mdash;  - a glaring fact that doesn&rsquo;t seem to occur to their people or politicians!</p>
