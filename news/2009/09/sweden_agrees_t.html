<h1><a href="https://www.thelocal.se/22322/20090927/">Sweden Agrees to Accept Camp Refugees</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local (Stockholm), September 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sweden and a dozen other European countries have agreed to accept Somali and Eritrean refugees from camps in Kenya and Sudan.</p>
<p>The refugees will be accepted into Sweden as part of quotas agreed with the UNHCR  &mdash;  the refugee organ of the United Nations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels good that Sweden can take part in such as large humanitarian operation,&#8221; Dan Eliasson, the director-general of the Swedish Migration Board, told Sveriges Radio&rsquo;s news programme Ekot.</p>
<p>Three further camps on Iraq&rsquo;s border with Syria will also be emptied in cooperation with the USA. The camps currently house mostly stateless Palestinian refugees.</p>
<p>&#8220;These camps are in the some of the most difficult places on Earth where the living conditions are dreadful. Now we can help to ensure .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that these people that live there can come to Europe and the USA,&#8221; Eliasson said.</p>
<p>Sweden is set to accept a couple of hundred refugees of the total of almost 3,000, according to Ekot.<br>

		<p>&#8220;It feels good.&#8221;  Now there&rsquo;s the three words that sum up white liberal race ideology better than any doctoral thesis.  Of course the African refugee camps are squalid.  That&rsquo;s because they are populated by Africans.  Over time, Sweden will become more like Somalia, grinding poverty included.</p>

<p>Yes. It&rsquo;s all about you isn&rsquo;t it. What a sub-standard person you are.</p>

I don&rsquo;t believe that Swedes really are that stupid!  Nor do I believe that they had any input into this evil, genocidal decision. Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t believe that Mr. Daniel Eliason is a real Swede himself either. (So why should he care?) It&rsquo;s a most unusual name for a Swede, to say the least.  And his indifference to the wellbeing of Swedes and Sweden confirms it.<br>

		<p>Im from Sweden and I am sad to tell you that since the early 70s  Sweden has been invaded by &#8220;immigrants&#8221;. Of our population of 9 millions over 1 million either are alien or are the children of them. Swedes in general (me and a minority aside) seem to think that it is  wonderful to let them come and denigrate our with their &#8220;fascinating&#8221;  &#8220;culture&#8221;. </p>

<p> I am Swedish American. Many European Swedish really are that stupid. They are giving everything away to foreigners. Naive is a better word, and they are similiar to other Western/Northern Europeans. Swedish Americans know better. Talking sense to family in NW Europe is like talking to a waste basket.</p>
<p>I was recently at a trade show in South America. Some of the attendees were from Nigeria. All of the Americans (north and south) did not trust them. The Nigerians were floating around trying to scam the vendors. They even tried to steal some of our demos. Even black South African attendees warned us about the Nigerians, that they will only steal. The Northern European companies welcomed the Nigerians with open arms. One German CEO (just as stupid as Swedish) preached to me, &#8220;it feels good to help these people.&#8221; It was almost identical to the ridiculous quote in this article. Even black South Africans have more common sense than stupid European liberals.</p>

		<p>I was reading about Maelmo, Sweden. The resident Algerians there regularly attack native Swedish people (muggings, rape, assualt, theft). One Algerian youth commented &#8220;It&rsquo;s so easy, Swedes are so weak and spineless. You can do anything you want to them without consequence.&#8221;. Although his comment filled me with rage, everything he said was true. What are we going to do about it?</p>

You can just as easily  substitute &#8220;naive&#8221; or  &#8220;inexperienced&#8221; for the word  &#8220;stupid&#8221;.  They will learn!  Eventually, they will wise up, given time    &mdash;   but, as always, that will only be  when it is too late.</p>

<p>Yes. I&rsquo;m afraid they are. Even by western European standards they are incredibly naive. Perhaps its because they have been at peace since Napoleon&rsquo;s day. Perhaps its because they never had any overseas empire. Whatever the reason they just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>

		<p>Masocism, Naivitee, Stupidity,&hellip; Well we have an interesting real world equation to digest&hellip; No doubt helping people that have fallen through the cracks is a humane behavior but if this is always a virtue wouldn&rsquo;t it follow that all the people in prisons around the world fall in that category ? Wasn&rsquo;t Equality and absolute loyalty to the perenial underdog the central philosophy of the communist movements? Isn&rsquo;t it true that Mao took pleasure in forcing the servants to humiliate and degrade their previous superiors? The issue here is when are we being good Samaritans in lending a helping hand and when are we casting our pearls before swine only to be justly gnashed to pieces in reward for our artificial goodness? When are we turning the cheek out of strength and when out of weakness/decadence? Some years back in Germany I think&hellip; There was a man that advertised on the internet looking for another man that was desiring to be eaten,&hellip; Lo and behold a man came forth and the procedure was accomplished with the dining begining at the testicles apparently * The nature of man is forward,.. eventually if he is prevented, especially in confusing ways he can not identify (anti white propoganda, possibly) he turns his aggressive nature against his self in any number of ways. This subject is larger than can be illuminated here but we can see amongst some of the more overly civilized Swede&rsquo;s or Scandic&rsquo;s a putrid inversion taking place like the diseased man that takes pleasure in watching his wife debauching with other men. My thoughts here are just generalized and certainly there are virtuous people of all types.</p>
