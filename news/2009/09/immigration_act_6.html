			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maria Sacchetti, Boston Globe, September 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A small but vocal group of advocates is urging illegal immigrants and their supporters nationwide to boycott the 2010 Census to protest the government&rsquo;s inaction on immigration legislation, a move that, if successful, could cost Massachusetts and other states millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The campaign is setting off alarms across the United States because census figures are crucial to determining how much federal funding cities and towns receive. A large-scale boycott, state officials and prominent pro-immigrant groups warn, could force Massachusetts to cut services from school lunch programs to highway construction, and heighten its chances of losing a seat in Congress.</p>
<p>But proponents say the boycott would pressure politicians to address problems illegal immigrants face every day  &mdash;  such as long separations from their families back home  &mdash;  and pursue a comprehensive overhaul of the country&rsquo;s immigration system that would provide a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Legalize us before you count us,&#8221; Fausto da Rocha, a Brazilian immigrant leader in Boston said on a talk-radio show in Quincy last week, where callers from as far away as Brunswick, Maine, expressed support for the boycott. &#8220;Politics is about power and money, and by not giving your information, you&rsquo;ll be taking away money and power from the politicians.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proposed boycott  &mdash;  organized this spring by the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders, a group based in Washington that represents 20,000 churches nationwide, including 300 in Massachusetts  &mdash;  is stirring deep divisions among immigrant communities. It faces stiff opposition from a string of advocacy groups, including the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, the Service Employees International Union, and the Brazilian Immigrant Center. To this point, the boycott effort has revolved mainly around word-of-mouth, talk radio, and blog entries by some members of participating churches.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the boycott is a national effort, states with significant percentages of immigrants such as Massachusetts stand to lose more because of formulas that base federal funding on population. Last year, Massachusetts received $11.4 billion in federal funds, and people who shun the census could cost the state about $1,755 apiece, said Brian McNiff, spokesman for the Massachusetts secretary of state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Participation in the census is required by law every 10 years so the government can obtain an accurate count of every resident in the United States. But the fine for failure to register is only $100, and the Census Bureau has generally not pursued violators. Instead, the agency encourages participation by spending millions in advertising and on workers who speak different languages.</p>
<p>A boycott would put the state at risk politically, said Secretary of State William F. Galvin. Because of a population shift to the South and West, he said, Massachusetts is at risk of losing one of its 10 congressional districts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But proponents of a boycott say it is a chance to grab the attention of politicians who have failed to pass legislation addressing illegal immigrants, even as their numbers have swelled to 12 million nationwide and 190,000 in Massachusetts  &mdash;  or about 1 in 5 immigrants. Overall, 14 percent of the state&rsquo;s population is foreign born; most are here legally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The idea of a boycott appears to have a sympathetic ear among many immigrants and their backers who called into the Quincy radio show last week.</p>

		<p>How horrible would this be?  Illegal aliens don&rsquo;t allow themselves to be counted, therefore illegal alien heavy states don&rsquo;t get the extra U.S. House seats.  Please don&rsquo;t throw me into the briar patch.</p>

<p>Yes, so we can draw unemployment and qualify for food stamps, free school lunches, free healthcare, and legally buy guns and ammo.</p>

		<p>No, count them first, so we know how many illegals there are who want to become instant &#8220;legals&#8221; (not necessarily citizens).  I&rsquo;ll bet the number is multiples of the 12 million figure, well above even the 20 million number sometimes given.  The higher the number, the more outraged the citizenry will be at amnesty attempts (I hope).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also not forget the millions and millions of anchor babies/children.  Let&rsquo;s also count them first before legalization of their parents.</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;census figures are crucial to determining how much federal funding cities and towns receive&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always considered this to be a problem.</p>
<p>It makes sense that cities with more people would be awarded more money but it also encourages cities to constantly expand their population to out compete other cities for money.</p>
<p>While a city with a stable population might be ideal, the drive to get more money by means of more people seems like a recipe for disaster.<br>

		<p>I hope every illegal alien boycotts the census.  The purpose of the census is to allocate to each state a number of representatives proportional to its population.  In no way should illegals get representation in congress.  The fact that various federal funds are allocated by population is secondary.  Also, if states with high illegal populations weren&rsquo;t rewarded with extra federal funds maybe they&rsquo;d stop with the sanctuary city nonsense, and in the case of Massachusetts stop inflicting horrors like Ted Kennedy on the rest of us.<br>

		<p>The 12 million illegals is of course a number coyly maintained by the MSM. Their precious agenda will be thwarted if the real figure of approximately 36 million becomes widely known. With 36 million Hispanics you quickly breed to a 100 million and then the sky is the limit.</p>

		<p>They need to be counted and then deported. They broke the law coming here,so why should we be play nice if they are stupid enough to allow themselves to be counted. Its time to enforce OUR laws and send them back to what ever country the came from. Ted you maybe dead, but I dont forgive you because you were a traitor to My country.</p>

		<p>Shows how far this country has gone down the commode when dirtbags like Fausto feel comfortable arrogantly and publicly making such demands, and the elected and appointed taxpayer-paid officialdom does absolutely NOTHING.<br>
Actually, a boycott like this may have a positive side.<br>
When the census dictates less fed funds allotted to the states, they in turn will be forced to make cuts and changes in public services: no proof of citizenship, no freebies.<br>
As well it should be.</p>

		<p>I prefer they NOT be counted in the census. We don&rsquo;t need additional services and representatives to cater to the Hispanic numbers. Whatever figure they came up with would be absurdly inaccurate, anyway.</p>
