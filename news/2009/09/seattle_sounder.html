			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, August 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Friday, the team [the Seattle Sounders] announced a partnership for the new Web site with La Raza del Noroeste, an Everett-based Spanish-language newspaper owned by The Washington Post Co.</p>
<p>Jorge Rivera, the newspaper&rsquo;s editor, will contribute to the site, updating news about players and the team in Spanish. {snip}</p>
<p>The site will also carry a video show about the Sounders produced by a Seattle affiliate of the Spanish language network Univision.</p>
<p>Sounders officials say traffic to the team site has increased from Central and South America since the team signed players like Colombians Fredy Montero and Jhon Kennedy, and Costa Rican Leo Gonzalez.</p>

<i>[Editor&rsquo;s Note: The Sounders Spanish site is available <b>here.</b>]</i>

		<p>The South Americans on my town&rsquo;s soccer team can beat the South Americans on your town&rsquo;s soccer team.  Also, the Africans on my town&rsquo;s basketball team can beat the Africans on your town&rsquo;s basketball team.  I am so proud.</p>

		<p>@1 Same thing with soccer in England and France, all matches are sell outs and the fans even fight, pathetic.<br>

		<p>For those of you who think the Pacific Northwest is some vast promised land of proud whites living among the tall trees, you&rsquo;re in for a big disappointment.  Every small town in Washington has been invaded by mestizos.  But don&rsquo;t take my word for it.  Look up the ethnic breakdown of schools in Washington. I don&rsquo;t have a link, but I know it&rsquo;s been posted in the past on AmRen.  It&rsquo;s between 10 and 15 percent hispanic from 4th grade up, and higher for first and second and third grades.  And that is our future.  The young people are overwhelmingly mestizo where I live, and the older whites are gradually fading away.  What is happening here is absolutely unbelieveable.   </p>

		<p>I went to one or two Real Salt Lake games when they first joined the league, but was turned off by the pandering to Mexicans.  The PA announcements were bilingual and every RSL goal was punctuated by the long, drawn-out &#8220;Goooooooal!&#8221; that seems to be mandatory in Latin America.  Even the team name panders to Hispanics   &mdash;   &#8220;real&#8221; means &#8220;royal&#8221; in Spanish, and is meant to evoke the famous Spanish team Real Madrid.  RSL won&rsquo;t be getting any more of my money.</p>

		<p>What, a professional American sports is discriminating against me by launching a website in a language that I neither speak nor understand?!!</p>
<p>Wait, it&rsquo;s only soccer? Oh, in that case use any language you feel like.</p>

		<p>Anonymous post #4 mentions the Hispandering by Real Salt Lake. Here&rsquo;s an even worse example: When the San Jose Earthquakes moved to Houston a few years ago, the team was going to rename itself &#8220;Houston 1836&#8221; in honor of the year Texas won its independence from Mexico. The area&rsquo;s Mexicans whined <i>en masse</i>, so the groveling team management dutifully changed &#8220;1836&#8221; to &#8220;Dynamo.&#8221;</p>
