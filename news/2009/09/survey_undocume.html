	<p>A study released Tuesday says that without enforcement, undocumented immigrants could get health care coverage through the president&rsquo;s proposed plan, costing Americans more than $30 billion annually.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s if all undocumented immigrants seek care  &mdash;  something another immigration expert and the study say is unlikely.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for benefits under the proposed America&rsquo;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, or HR 3200, about which President Barack Obama plans to address Congress at 5 p.m. today.</p>
<p>However, the study by the Center for Immigration Studies says the bill&rsquo;s lack of an enforcement provision opens the door to the undocumented taking advantage of the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a bar on illegal immigrants getting the affordable credit and it&rsquo;s unenforced, it&rsquo;s kind of like a speed limit on a highway that police say they&rsquo;re never going to enforce,&#8221; said Steven Camarota, director of research.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rasmussen Reports this week found that more than 80 percent of voters say government health care benefits should be restricted to U.S. citizens only.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Money matters</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2006, a Desert Sun analysis found undocumented immigrants pump nearly $1.5 billion annually into the Riverside County economy while costing residents roughly $220 million for the social services they use.</p>
<p>Roughly 6.6 million uninsured, undocumented immigrants  &mdash;  or slightly more than half of the nation&rsquo;s undocumented population  &mdash;  could receive benefits under the proposed health care plan, the study says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The majority of undocumented immigrants are uninsured  &mdash;  some studies say 60 percent, others put the figure as high as 68 percent.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re also young and very healthy, and a scenario in which all the undocumented seek health insurance coverage is unlikely, according to experts such as the Pew Hispanic Center and the RAND Corp.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2005 RAND study co-authored by Smith found that nationally the medical cost for the undocumented was $5.2 billion annually, or less than 2 percent of the total national cost.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Nicole C. Brambila, The Desert Sun (Palm Springs, California), September 8, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A new study released today shows that, without enforcement, the undocumented could gain health care coverage through President Barack Obama&rsquo;s proposed plan, costing Americans more than $30 billion annually.</p>
<p>Roughly 6.6 million uninsured, undocumented immigrants  &mdash;  or about half of the nation&rsquo;s undocumented population  &mdash;  could, because of lack of enforcement, receive benefits under the proposed health care plan, according to a study released by the Center for Immigration Studies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report did recognize that it is likely many undocumented immigrants would not enroll in the proposed plan out of fear or the lack of knowledge about the program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for benefits under the proposed America&rsquo;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, or HR 3200.</p>
<p>However, the study argues the bill&rsquo;s lack of an enforcement provision opens the door to the undocumented taking advantage of the program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congress voted down an amendment in July that would have required the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements program be used to verify eligibility.</p>
<p>Among the report&rsquo;s findings:</p>
<p>* The cost of treating uninsured, undocumented immigrants is roughly $4.3 billion annually, in emergency rooms and free clinics.</p>
<p>* In 2007, 38 percent of undocumented immigrants had health insurance.</p>
<p>Under the proposed plan, the bill establishes government subsidies to reduce the cost of purchasing insurance to the qualifying poor; expands Medicaid eligibility and imposes an income tax on high-income individuals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration advocates said they were not surprised the undocumented were brought into the health care debate.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a number of Americans that are adamantly opposed to any support,&#8221; said Juan Lujan, a Latin American expert and dean of off-campus programs for College of the Desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t look at the whole picture; at what they contribute, what they do, the jobs they have.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration opponents have long argued that the undocumented are a drain on public services.</p>
<p>In 2006, though, a Desert Sun analysis found undocumented immigrants pump nearly $1.5 billion annually into the Riverside County economy while costing residents roughly $220 million for the social services they use.</p>

		<p>They will benefit.  The nonsense about ObamaCare not allowing illegals is nonsense.  While a few of the House HCR proposals do explicitly block illegal aliens, it&rsquo;s window dressing for one or more of these reasons:</p>
<p>(1)  The House and Senate Dem leadership won&rsquo;t let a bill out of Capitol Hill with that language in it.</p>
<p>(2)  Even if they do and Obama signs, there won&rsquo;t be any enforcement mechanism.</p>
<p>(3)  Even if there was an enforcement mechanism, illegal aliens can and do get fake IDs.  </p>
<p>(4)  Even if they couldn&rsquo;t get fake IDs, then there is the matter of pure common sense.  ObamaCare would be run and administered by Federal bureaucrats, and many of those, especially those who run a new Federal entitlement program, are either white liberals or racial minorities.  In illegal alien-heavy states, many of these Federal bureaucrats are Hispanic.  Do you honestly think that they&rsquo;ll tell illegal aliens &ldquo;no mas&rdquo; when they come to the Federal building to sign up for ObamaCare?  It would be the job of the U.S. Justice Department and the relevant U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office to prosecute such Federal bureaucrats, and certainly the current Eric Holder-run Just-Us Department won&rsquo;t file charges.  Even the U.S. Just-Us Department of a future Republican Presidential Administration won&rsquo;t have the stones to do this, either, as the Stupid Party is still pretending they can get the Hispanic vote.</p>
<p>(5) Next on the agenda after HCR is &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform,&#8221; i.e. amnesty.  Which will entirely solve the illegal immigration problem, and therefore eliminate the possibility that illegal aliens will get ObamaCare.  </p>

Despite the denials that illegal aliens won&rsquo;t have access to our coming health care reform system, does anyone seriously believe that doctors and hospitals are going to be required to ask about residency status? Does anyone believe that even if they did ask that illegals would be turned away?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet they move to the head of the line because they&rsquo;re &#8216;at risk&rsquo; and &#8216;under served&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>What all conservatives / secessionists / just plain non-liberals should realize is this:<br>
The Democratic party is controlled by George Soros and he has a history of betting successfully <br>
in the currency market. He did so with the British pound.He is betting the dollar will fail big time; in other words he is planning a huge short position in the currency market. The Democrats are doing his bidding. The bottom line is that a few ruthless people will get very rich and even more powerful when the dollar, and the US economy, tanks.</p>
<p>Everything the Democratic Party is doing now and contemplating doing in the future is based on Soros.</p>

		<p>In 1964, Senator Hubert Humphrey swore that affirmative action would not ever mean discrimination against Whites.</p>
<p>In 1965, Ted Kennedy promised that the immigration bill would not change America&rsquo;s demographics.  </p>
<p>Anyone who believes the word of BHO or any other anti-White is a fool.  If a law can be used against us, it will be.  If affirmative action was not intended to impoverish Whites, it&rsquo;s supporters would have prevented it from doing so.  As it is, a White man has to fight all the way to the Supreme Court to get a promotion.  That is proof of the real intent of the Reds.  The fact that the immigration act has caused the displacement of Whites without any serious attempt by the government to prevent it, is proof that it was intended to do so.  Don&rsquo;t bother to split hairs with Reds and Neocons about the wording of the law, point out that they have consistently lied and that we have every reason to think they are doing so now.  </p>
<p>Every year for decades, Charlie Brown tried to kick the football and every year Lucy pulled it away, leaving Charlie Brown flat on his back.  (That&rsquo;s from the comic strip &#8220;Peanuts&#8221; for you younger readers.)  That used to annoy me, but I&rsquo;ve come to see that the cartoonist was on to something in some people&rsquo;s psychology.  Liberals and conservatives are engaged in some kind of sick, sado-masochistic dance, and they deserve each other.  Politics is treason by other means.</p>

<p>Bull. I&rsquo;ll bet they didn&rsquo;t count those in jail and going through the court system, that costs big bucks, they didn&rsquo;t count those who go to the emergency room, they didn&rsquo;t count all the fraud the illegals used, they didn&rsquo;t count all the anchor babies and the costs for overcrowded schools and english-as-a-second language, or the food stamps etc. Why is California broke? Why is anywhere the illegals are always drained? Anyways, if these people are here illegally, how could they tell how much they contribute or take from the economy?</p>

		<p>Illegal invaders are getting free health care right now. All they do is show up at emergency rooms around the country and they have to be tended to thanks to the US court system.</p>

		<p>This is a peripheral issue.  If the invaders are present in our country, they will syphon off of our welfare system.  And no one in the media has addressed the most gaping loophole of all  &mdash;  the invaders may have as many anchor babies as they choose and the tax payer (i.e. white people) will flit the bill  &mdash;  no questions asked.</p>
<p>Even if the Obama adminstration were sincere about excluding the invaders, it matters little, they&rsquo;ll just reproduce and syphon off the benefits regardless.  The end result will be the same.  If the Republicans really had balls, they&rsquo;d be fighting to  remove the invaders and their anchor babies permanently: no more automatic citizenship, no more free healthcare at the U.S. taxpayers expense.  But Republicans don&rsquo;t really care enough to veere out very far on that limb  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s all a dog and pony show for their clueless supporters.</p>

		<p>Does this mean that illegals could be going to doctors&rsquo; offices instead of clogging emergency rooms? Illegals already get free heath care at our expense. </p>

		<p>Putting up a stop sign will not make anyone stop unless the laws are enforced.  What&rsquo;s the point of saying illegals will not receive health care benefits when they already can get it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s illegal to cross the border without documents.  Does that stop the illegals from coming across?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s illegal to work without being here legally.  Does that stop the illegals from using fraudulent SS numbers or lying on their job applications?</p>
<p>Obama would like to say (and America believe) that health care reform will not include illegal aliens.  Do you really think that will stop the illegals from lying or creating phony documents to get it?  If you do, dream on. </p>

		<p>Another unintended consequence of  alien bashing is heading our way. All will have ID cards allowing medical care, A &#8221; Mark of the Beast,&#8221; most likely not; however aliens without a card will be turned in to Immigration as they are patched up in emergency rooms. Of course they won`t go and will die if really hurt. I say who cares; however here is where things get tricky. Illegal aliens are rife with TB and other infectious maladies. These are usually caught in ERs. Since they won`t be going there they will just sit around 7-11s and rich people`s kitchens infecting us at will. Half of all illegals from anywhere but Mexico have been exposed to TB. Wilson is correct. Obama will end up treating illegals and I say Thank God. I had a close relative age 7 have to spend a year on her little back, because somebody exposed her to TB. We can`t afford another 50,000 kids like her going through Hell to make us feel like we are kicking illegal tails.<br>

		<p>Anyone who has lived in a Western U.S. city knows that the best time to go to the ER (if you&rsquo;re white) is Saturday or Sunday morning! the illegal southerners are recovering from their week end parties and except for gunshot/knife wounds the Mex&rsquo;s are recovering&hellip;but come Monday morning! they are all and I mean ALL in the ER with hangovers saying they are SICK! they WILL be treated and they know it. Of course, I live on the east coast now and have been over here for on to 6 years now so things may have changed a bit.</p>
