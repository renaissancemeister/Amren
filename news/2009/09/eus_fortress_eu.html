<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Each summer, European Union countries are overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of migrants struggling to their shores in search of a better life.</p>
<p>Scenes of French authorities evicting would-be immigrants from a makeshift camp near Calais that officials call a den of crime, known as &#8220;the jungle,&#8221; are highlighting the problem this week.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a problem that first hit European headlines a decade ago, so it may seem surprising just how little the EU has done to create an effective policy on immigration, asylum, or repatriation.</p>
<p>Now some countries are taking matters into their own hands: Italy has already begun summarily turning back immigrants caught at sea, and it&rsquo;s raising protests by human rights groups. </p>
<p>Italy, Greece, and other southern EU countries bear the brunt of the wave of arrivals across the Mediterranean Sea from Africa, a passage fraught with danger. Hundreds die each year when their overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels capsize. </p>
<p>Still, more than 37,000 &#8220;boat people&#8221; arrived in Italy alone last year. This year, the Italian authorities took the unprecedented step of turning back boats with immigrants at sea before they land on shore. The measure has reduced by half the number of illegal immigrants arriving in Italy. </p>
<p>Italian officials deny they&rsquo;re breaking the law, but the new policy has provoked an outcry from human rights group who say it breaches international obligations by denying immigrants the chance to apply for asylum. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>EU regulations stipulate that immigrants must be processed by the country in which they first set foot. That policy angers the southern EU countries that serve as transit routes for migrants bound for richer, northern EU countries. They say governments not directly affected by the Mediterranean migration should pay Italy, Malta, and other southern European countries compensation. </p>
<p>Among long-term proposals is a resettlement scheme for asylum seekers who&rsquo;ve lodged applications outside the EU. </p>
<p>EU attempts to cooperate with transit and &#8220;source&#8221; countries in Africa have seen little success. Italy notably failed to get Libya to block what&rsquo;s now the main southern route into the EU after Frontex cooperation with Tunisia and Mauretania largely closed off a popular route along Africa&rsquo;s west coast. Turkey, which has a readmission treaty with the EU, often refuses to honor it. </p>
<p>Barrot said on September 21 that the only viable long-term solution for the EU is to start processing would-be immigrants on the &#8220;southern shore of the Mediterranean.&#8221; But the lack of cooperation inside the EU so far means that&rsquo;s unlikely to happen any time soon.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Radio Free Europe&#8221; is an anti-white propaganda organ of the US government.  Notice the article suggests that the solution to the problem of illegal immigration to Europe is to legalize it.  RFE also propagandizes for Turkey to be admitted to the EU and attacks nationalist governments in places like Russia and Serbia that refuse to go along with the agenda of white dispossession.  </p>

		<p>Italy&rsquo;s policy of refusing landing of &#8220;boat people&#8221; may be cruel, it may violate EU laws, but they are justified and I like what they are doing (notice that it works: according to this article, the flow of illegal immigrants has been halved).</p>
<p>And screw these &#8220;human rights groups&#8221;.  They don&rsquo;t want to take any personal responsibility for these &#8220;boat people&#8221;, whether where they are coming from or where they are going (if I&rsquo;m wrong here I will gladly admit it).  They also don&rsquo;t give a damn about the rights of native Europeans to not be overrun by third-world invaders (and neither do the governments of EU nations, sadly).</p>
<p>I just thought of this: Isn&rsquo;t it funny that the white man isn&rsquo;t supposed to colonize the world anymore, but blacks, browns, etc. have free reign to colonize and take over white countries with impunity, with the blessing of suicidal white &#8220;leaders&#8221; in said countries.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Italy has been turning back immigrants at sea and it is raising protests from human rights groups&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>First, they are NOT &#8220;immigrants&#8221;. They are illegal aliens - criminal trespassers. Since when is it a &#8220;human right&#8221; to illegally and unlawfully enter Italy?</p>
<p>Its the camp of the saints folks. Will Europe fight back?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got to take issue with these &#8220;international obligations&#8221;. A previous government has made promises on our behalf that we are not now allowed to change - have I got that right? That doesn&rsquo;t sound democratic. I think these obligations need to come up for annual renewal and debate just in case we democratically decide they are not in our interest.</p>
<p>Are there any countries in the world that can live up to all their international obligations? From what I see in the news every country in the world is in violation of one kind or another of international obligation. So who decided that Europe&rsquo;s asylum  policy has to meet the strictest standards of international obligation when the world abounds in unmet international obligations? </p>

		<p>Every human rights advocate should be induced to put their money and efforts where their mouth is in aiding these invaders back to where they came from and helping them have a better life in their native lands. When foreign peoples came unninvited century&rsquo;s ago it was called an act of aggression or invasion, only now these progressive Euro-effetes-effeminates can&rsquo;t see the writing on the wall. Fortunately some indivinduals that still have their testes like Berlusconi have refused to buckle under these diseased sato-masocistic emotionalisms.</p>

		<p>The book &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; has come to life only 35 years after it was written. While stationed at Sigonella, I have seen some of the illegal aliens floating around Sicily and it is not a pretty sight. </p>

		<p>One of the by products of massive free food for africa has been a population explosion.  I call them Geldoff&rsquo;s Army.  They will be pouring into europe like locusts and might possibly even drive out the new muslims owners of the continent.</p>

<p>Relative to the availability of food brings to mind a program I saw on DISCOVERY I believe, or NATGEO about a gigantic plague of MICE in Australia. Because of a large crop of something being plowed under and thereby providing a huge unexpected food source,thus causing the mice to out produce themselves, and THEN go to other places!</p>

<p>That was very well said. Its true. Call it the law of unintended consequences. The fact is when one interferes with the natural Malthusian processes of keeping African populations in check you unleash all sorts of trouble. All those Christian groups and U.N. programs concentrated so hard on reducing infant mortality in those countries. What they didn&rsquo;t realize was now vastly more children would grow into adults. There were no jobs or opportunities for these &#8220;new adults&#8221; (the ones who would have died in their childhood). Likewise they in their turn had even more children. A vicious cycle was created. &#8220;Bottom-up&#8221; solutions don&rsquo;t work for third world countries. What you need are &#8220;top-down&#8221; ones.</p>
