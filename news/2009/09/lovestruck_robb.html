			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A suspected robber has been arrested after he returned to his victim&rsquo;s home to ask her out on a date.</p>
<p>Stephfon Bennett, 20, was one of three men who robbed a couple at gunpoint in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Daniel Martinez Batista and Diana Martinez were held up outside their apartment block on Saturday night, according to police.</p>
<p>The three robbers fled when a neighbour threatened them. Batista&rsquo;s wallet was stolen, and Martinez&rsquo;s handbag was taken.</p>
<p>Less than two hours after the incident, Bennett returned to the property and asked the woman out.</p>
<p>Columbus police Sergeant Sean Laird said: &#8216;We are not exactly sure what he was thinking at the time.</p>
<p>&#8216;She recognised him right away when he returned and was able to have her cousin call 911.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bennett was arrested in front of the house and now faces aggravated robbery charges.</p>
<p>He is being held in the Franklin County jail on $100,000 bail.</p>
<p>The other two men suspected of breaking into the house remain at large.</p>

		<p>Now ain´t it just like them - he probably thought he´s irresistible (&#8220;thought&#8221;?).<br>
How the lady must have felt &hellip; the only logical thing to assume was that he was having second thoughts (again, &#8220;thoughts&#8221;?) and returning to have a little fun and then finish the witnesses. Too bad she wasn´t armed.</p>

		<p>He DID return to rape her. Why else would he go back? Obviously he expected her to recognise him, and he went back to do what 40,000 other black men do every year in the U.S. - rape white women.</p>

<p>I think this is all a misunderstanding of what &#8220;date&#8221; means when said by a black criminal.  Your interpretation is not inconsistent with that understanding.</p>

		<p>The pahetic excuse for a human really thought his victim would be so enamoured with his manliness that she would cheat on her husband with him (because he is a real man).<br>
How often when these retards rape a woman do they convince themselves that she really likes it?<br>
What an idiot.</p>

		<p>#10,  No doubt you are spot on about this particular criminal&rsquo;s intentions.  I wonder how accurate your number of black rapists of white women (in America, per year) is, though. </p>
<p>The number 40,000 sounds like the number of victims on the books.  But how many had multiple attackers?  And does this number include all victims, or only those whose cases ended with capture and conviction of the perpetrator(s)? </p>
<p>If so, then the actual number of black rapists of white women (and men) is higher.  </p>

<p>Yes! The BNP&rsquo;s discussing now whether to become more cultural. Hopefully nothing will change with that party, but it&rsquo;s a shame it even needs to consider such a move.</p>
<p>Sometimes Britain looks like it&rsquo;s following the American playbook of &#8220;how to ethnically cleanse a white nation&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I occasionally watch spanish language newscasts to keep my spanish up to par, and was surprised to see the this event actually made the news. Unlike its American counterparts, this news report interviewed the female victim and showed a picture of the robber.</p>
<p>oh and btw she wasn&rsquo;t a real looker,very dark and indigenous looking, but she was smart enough to say &#8220;No&#8221; and report this idiot to the police!</p>

		<p>What a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize is that blacks tend to have very high levels of self-esteem, notwithstanding their low I.Q. levels and lack of legitimate accomplishments (both individually and as a race). He&rsquo;s a legend in his own mind&hellip;</p>

		<p>Anon:  I don&rsquo;t think blacks have higher self-esteems *in spite* of their lower IQ (as a generality), but *because* of their lower IQ.  When you&rsquo;re not that intelligent, you&rsquo;re also not aware of your own shortcomings.  Therefore, you&rsquo;re more susceptible to public school self-esteem mania.  This also explains why the suicide rate is higher among whites than blacks, because it takes a high IQ to feel shame.</p>

Dateline: NEW CASTLE, Del.<br>
Police say a man involved in the recent robbery of a Domino&rsquo;s Pizza delivery woman would be a good candidate for &#8220;World&rsquo;s Dumbest Criminal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police say that after two men robbed the woman, one of them called the victim on his cell phone to apologize - and to ask her out on a date. </p>

		<p>Last night I was rolling around white websites.  I think I went from Sarah Maid of Albion to Green Arrow.</p>
<p>I think it was Green Arrow that had a listing of white victims of black crime in Britain.  A most recent listing showed a white woman who had a first date with a black man.  Once in the park, he wanted to steal her car.  She refused, so he stabbed her to death.</p>
<p>I only mention this as it identical to the above facts.  Maybe this is a standard black tactic for stealing cars.</p>
<p>Not too bright should you ask me.</p>

		<p>Sir you are correct that low IQ equals high esteem among blacks.Local NC TV news shows often show local school kids stating things like&#8221; i wants to be a brains surgeon when i grows up&#8221;.I kid you not, they are taught they are the masters of the Universe in local schools.</p>
<p>The story that the young man asked a robbery victim out on a date also reminds me of a terrible case 12 or so years ago in Raleigh where a teeneage black boy killed a beautiful white woman jogger when she rebuffed his request..&#8221;do you want to make love?&#8221; They were in a upscale suburban neighborhood and he was on a bike.Blacks have a inflated opinion of their value.</p>

<p>Adding to your point, when blacks are elementary school children, they tend to have fantastic views of their future profession.  But once they, especially the boys and men, get to age 20 and are on either end of a murder, they are (in the case of the doer) are good boys and &#8220;athletes&#8221; that just happened to fall in with the wrong crowd, or (in the case of the victim) an aspiring rapper.  Either athlete or rapper.  What happened to all the doctors, lawyers, brain surgeons and rocket scientists?</p>
<p>As an aside, black children tend to do well, in some cases ahead of whites, through pre-K, KG and the start of elementary school.  But around 4th grade, maybe 5th, circa ages 10 and 11, they tend to level off and the whites surpass them.  The reason I think is twofold: (1) Black mental development levels off, and (2) Round about 4th/5th grade, education starts to ease away from the teaching of basic skills and starts to introduce critical and abstract thinking.</p>
