			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, September 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of Professional Responsibility has begun an official inquiry into the dismissal in May of a civil complaint against the New Black Panther Party and two of its members who disrupted a Philadelphia polling place during the November general elections.</p>
<p>The inquiry is disclosed in an Aug. 28 letter to Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee who first raised questions about the dismissal in May and asked unsuccessfully that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. make available the head of the department&rsquo;s Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division for a closed-door briefing on the decision.</p>
<p>In the letter, Mary Patrice Brown, acting OPR counsel, told the veteran congressman from Texas that the office had &#8220;initiated an inquiry into the matter&#8221; and that it would &#8220;contact you with the results of our inquiry once it is completed.&#8221; A copy of the letter was obtained by The Washington Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am pleased that someone at the Justice Department is finally taking the dismissal of the New Black Panther Party case seriously,&#8221; Mr. Smith said Wednesday. &#8220;The Justice Department&rsquo;s decision to drop a case against political allies who allegedly intimidated voters on Election Day 2008 reeks of political interference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Smith said the department&rsquo;s refusal to provide Congress with an explanation for the dismissal &#8220;only further raises concerns that political favoritism played a role in this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Frank R. Wolf, Virginia Republican and a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, has unsuccessfully sought to interview the career lawyers involved in the case and has called on Mr. Holder to refile the civil complaint. He said he was &#8220;deeply troubled&#8221; by the dismissal, adding that &#8220;this stinks to high heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After months of unanswered questions, incomplete and faulty excuses, and revelations of political influence, the Office of Professional Responsibility has agreed with our July 9 letter asking for a full investigation of the dismissal of this important voter intimidation case over the objections of both the career attorneys on the trial team and the department&rsquo;s own appellate board,&#8221; he said Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>OPR, which reports directly to the attorney general, is responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct involving department attorneys in the exercise of their authority to investigate, litigate or provide legal advice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Justice Department memo shows that the front-line career lawyers who brought the case decided as early as December to seek a complaint against the party; its chairman, Malik Zulu Shabazz, a lawyer and D.C. resident; Minister King Samir Shabazz, a resident of Philadelphia and head of the Philadelphia chapter who was accused of wielding the nightstick; and Jerry Jackson, a resident of Philadelphia and a party member.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Mr. Samir Shabazz, armed with the nightstick, and Mr. Jackson used racial slurs and made threats as they stood outside the polling place door.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson was an elected member of Philadelphia&rsquo;s 14th Ward Democratic Committee and was credentialed to be at the polling place as an official Democratic Party polling watcher, according to the Philadelphia city commissioner&rsquo;s office. Records show he obtained new credentials as a poll watcher &#8220;at any ward/division in Philadelphia&#8221; just days after the charges against him were dismissed.</p>
<p>None of the New Black Panthers responded to the charges or made any appearance in court. The party has not returned e-mails for comment, and the voice mailbox at its Washington headquarters Wednesday was full.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Loretta King, who was acting assistant attorney general, ordered the delay after she discussed with Mr. Perrelli concerns about the case during one of their regular review meetings, according to the interviews. Mrs. King, a career senior executive service official, had been named by President Obama in January to temporarily fill the vacant political position of assistant attorney general for civil rights while a permanent choice could be made.</p>
<p>She and other career supervisors ultimately recommended dropping the case against two of the men and the party. Mr. Perrelli approved that plan, officials said.</p>

I, for one, can&rsquo;t wait to hear AG Holders&rsquo; explanation for the dismissal of this case.</p>
<p>Good heavens, they have video of these guys. How much more clear could it be?</p>

<p>I suppose if a black woman said she felt intimidated by seeing a passing police car on her way to vote, Congress would be holding hearings (as they did with Bush in Florida).<br>

		<p>     Don&rsquo;t hold your breath on this one. The Democrats and Republicans are in bed with each other on too many issues. Mr. Smith will be told to shut his mouth and the investigation will be dropped or relegated to the comic section of your local Pravda.</p>

		<p>A lot of good this will do. Rep. Frank R. Wolf, will get stonewalled. It will turn out to be another whitewash. Nobody is going to loose their jobs, at best someone might get reassigned. The Black Panther thugs are already off the hook and no one is going to rearrest them. By next year&rsquo;s election all this will have been forgotten and the Black Panther thugs will be out in force, because they know they can get away with it.  </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s how it worked   &mdash;  </p>
<p>Holder, the black AG, wanted charges dropped against his homeboy the thug. Not wanting the responsibility himself he told an underling, a black woman, to do the deed. She found one of her white underlings to actually drop the charges. Voila! </p>

		<p>Why was the case dropped?  Because those thugs are black, because we have a black man in office, and because he is appointing only blacks to positions of power.  That&rsquo;s the answer.</p>

		<p>I do happen to remember the lame excuse as to why the charges were dropped against the Black Panther racist thugs, it was because they didn&rsquo;t show up in court to defend themselves so thus all charges were dropped. EXCUSE ME!  Am I missing something here? I have never heard of something so ridiculous in my whole life. In this country if you don&rsquo;t show up in court to face criminal charges against you A WARRANT IS PUT OUT FOR YOUR ARREST!  This is a total failure to follow our justice system and all those involved should resign or be fired.  This is just typical of the atrocities that are being committed by the Obama administration on a daily basis.     </p>

		<p>If you search on the net, you&rsquo;ll find that &#8220;career service official&#8221; King was a protégée of Devil Patrick, who brought her into the Civil Rights Division. It seems reasonable to assume that she too is black.</p>

<p>As a strong supporter of gun rights, I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. </p>
<p>As a police officer though, I can&rsquo;t figure out how the tape goes on for so long without the Philadelphia police ever showing up. </p>
<p>Two guys dressed in paramilitary garb, one of them brandishing a stick, both of them acting hostile and belligerent at the entrance to a public facility, and the police aren&rsquo;t coming from every direction? </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the first thing about Philadelphia, and I&rsquo;m not criticizing their police, but come on&hellip;that&rsquo;s what 911 calls are for. </p>

		<p>This is actually a real black eye for Obama.  I just wish the press would run with it.  Anything that links Obama with racial politics is bad for him.  Our post-racial President is anything but.  </p>

		<p><i>I take it that Philadelphia is doesn&rsquo;t allow concealed or open carry?</i></p>
<p>Both are allowed with a permit, which is easy to get, since Pennsylvania is shall-issue. (Outside Philadelphia, only concealed carry requires a permit.) </p>
<p><i>I would love to have seen the look on the face of the night stick wielding &lsquo;Mr. Shabazz&rsquo; if he had been approached by an open carrying member of the public&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Same here. Hopefully, next election, white Philadelphians will be better prepared. <br>

<p>It is probably part of PA&rsquo;s CCW law to carry concealed (and its overall laws to carry open) in or near a polling place, and certainly no carrying in or near a school, where many polling places are.  If some white Philly resident (almost an oxymoron) took you up on your advice, s/he&rsquo;d be the one in really big trouble, not the black domestic terrorist.</p>

<p>This is a fair point, but in my state, it&rsquo;s only illegal to carry <i>inside</i> a polling place or <i>on</i> school grounds. Carrying on the sidewalk right outside a school or polling place is perfectly legal. And if the polling place isn&rsquo;t at a school, then carrying right outside the door would probably be legal. </p>
<p>Of course, this has nothing to do with Pennsylvania law, but I have no reason to believe my state&rsquo;s law is atypical. </p>

<p>If the OPR is under the AG, then there&rsquo;s no use in having an inquiry, because Holder is the one who is behind dropping the charges against the black insurrectionists.</p>
<p>He needs them in his battle against whites.  They are part of the Obamacorps that is going to be as &#8220;well-funded, strong, and powerful as the military.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, they are part of Obama&rsquo;s black army that he is going to use to keep whites in line when he makes his move to make this country a black-controlled three thousand mile ghetto.<br>
Soon they will be armed with M-16&rsquo;s.</p>
