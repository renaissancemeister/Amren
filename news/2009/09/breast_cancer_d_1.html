<h1>Breast Cancer Death Rates Continue to Drop 2% Annually</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution, September 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fewer women in the United States are dying from breast cancer, but disparities in death rates still exist between whites and blacks, a new report shows.</p>
<p>Deaths from breast cancer have dropped more than 2 percent each year since 1990. And in the past decade that decline in deaths has been shared by black, Hispanic and white women. But black women still have a 40 percent higher death rate from breast cancer than white women, according to the report, Breast Cancer Facts &amp; Figures 2009-2010, released Wednesday by the American Cancer Society.</p>
<p>&#8220;The breast cancer death rate continues to decrease since the 1990s in U.S. women because of improved treatments and increased mammography screening rates,&#8221; said Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, strategic director for cancer surveillance at the American Cancer Society.</p>

<p>Other highlights of the report include:</p>

<p>* From 1997 to 2006, breast cancer deaths dropped by 1.9 percent a year among white and Hispanic women, 1.6 percent a year among black women, and 0.6 percent annually among Asian-American and Pacific Islander women. Death rates have stayed the same for American Indians and Alaska Natives.</p>

Does anyone know what breast cancer rates (and other cancer rates) are for Africans in Africa?</p>
<p>Are black cancer rates higher or lower for blacks in white, western nations?</p>
<p>Knowing that might shed light on whether blacks are genetically unsuited for living in white western nations.<br>

		<p>I can only surmise from my many experiences at mammogram centers, but I rarely EVER see a black woman as a patient at these centers. Based on over 20 years of these tests annually plus some additional testing, it&rsquo;s obvious that very few black women follow the recommended health guidelines. If they fail to do so with mammograms, it can be assumed they also fail to do so in every area of medical care.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that breast cancer in black women has been linked to their overuse of hair care products containing toxic chemicals. </p>

		<p>There is somewhat of a genetic component in all types of cancer.<br>
Breast cancer is more likely to occur in women who are obese and whose breasts are larger than normal.</p>
<p>Those hair product myths are just that, myths. </p>

		<p>Of course, logically speaking, this must mean that white women are 40% more likely to die of something other than breast cancer, but don&rsquo;t expect them to put that spin on it.</p>

		<p>The lastest research shows African Americans and other dark Americans have low amounts of vitamin D.  Cancer and vitamin D may be linked.  Blacks need about 3 hours of sun every day to make the vitamin whereas whites need about 20 minutes a day on average.  </p>
