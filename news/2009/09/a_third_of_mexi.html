<h1>A Third of Mexicans Would Migrate to US: Survey</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One in three Mexicans would migrate to the United States if they had the chance, and many would go illegally at a time of rising drug violence in Mexico, a survey released on Wednesday showed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The survey by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based public opinion research organization, found that 57 percent of Mexicans believe those who move from Mexico to the United States enjoy a better life.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asked if they would like to move to the United States, 33 percent of those taking part in the survey said &#8220;yes&#8221; and 18 percent said they would move even without the necessary visas.</p>
<p>&#8220;People see the U.S. as a land of opportunity &hellip; and they see a lot of problems in Mexico. They are worried about crime, about the economy, drugs and corruption,&#8221; said Richard Wike, who worked on the nationwide face-to-face survey of 1,000 Mexicans conducted between May 26 and June 2.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexicans have a love-hate relationship with their northern neighbor, attracted by its higher wages and enamored of its shopping malls but still sore at the loss of nearly half their territory to the United States after a 19th century war.</p>
<p>Almost 40 percent of the survey&rsquo;s respondents said they had relatives or close friends in the United States.</p>
<p>Around 11.9 million illegal immigrants, mostly Hispanic, live and work in the United States, including millions of Mexicans. Americans are divided about how to handle them.</p>
<p>Many border experts say illegal immigration to the United States will rise again from historic lows this year as the U.S. economy recovers and businesses ranging from farms to factories seek to hire cheap labor.</p>

		<p>This is supposed to be surprising? My Lord, I would think that when people from ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, hear that the moment they land on the shores of America, or go past the border, LEGALLY, they are then entitled to immediate welfare and housing, why would they not want to migrate to the U.S. Just living in this nation, compared to some of the place these people come from drastically improves their lives. The catch is, it&rsquo;s all at the expense of the traditional American citizenry. OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, IT&rsquo;S ALL POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS A RE-DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH SCHEME. This has been going on for years, and still is because of the massive LEGAL, AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION THAT IS ALLOWED BY THE TRAITORS IN CHARGE OF THE U.S., who care not a wit about Americans. DO THEY???</p>

<p>So in essence what these invaders feel for the USA, is a twisted lust to both use and abuse our country in the same manner that a man&rsquo;s bitter and ineffectual enemy might desire to inflict upon his gorgeous but unworldly: wife, daughter, or sister. While he never can best this superior man physically, socially, or economically because of his own weaknesses and stupidities, he can diabolically attempt to seduce and exploit his female relations because of their more empathetic and naïve natures. In short, a predatory and cowardly dwarf&rsquo;s strategy of vengeance! </p>
<p>That in a nutshell is the alien invaders&rsquo; approach, when they beguile and intimidate the languidly effete elites of this country at the expense of a muscular majority that holds them beneath contempt and would smash them like the cockroaches they are, if they were not so hysterically restrained by those same decadently treacherous power harlots!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

<p>Please, Mexico made a deal with the USA where both sat down and decided where the boundaries should be. The land that the USA got was considered worthless by Mexico, barely inhabited and the USA paid for it. If they want to be mad, they need to be mad at their government at that time. Anyways, it&rsquo;s not about land. Mexico has a lot of land and natural resources, it&rsquo;s about the people who make a land what it is.</p>

		<p>The United States of America was founded by people from the British Isles and central and northern Europe, FOR THEMSELVES. As we know, the USA became a superpower under the governance of their descendants and the fact that we as citizens shared the same racial heritage. When others who have no such shared heritage and are not descended from the high cultures of the world infiltrate our creation, they effectively degrade, ruin, and destroy it. The blame for the disintegration of our once-majestic nation can be placed, as always, on the bizarre, self-loathing liberals, whose phony concern for the plight of the downtrodden masses around the globe are anything but benevolent.</p>
<p>Wherever you find a Mexican, you find Mexico. Terribly true.</p>

		<p>How many Mexicans were actually living in the land that was taken by the US? Very few, am I correct? So few, that the first Texas settlers were actually invited by Mexico because the land was so sparsely populated. </p>
<p>If there were millions and millions of Mexicans living in the terrotories and displaced by the white man I could understand their grievance; but unless I&rsquo;ve missed something, the Mexican government&rsquo;s ownership of the southwestern US basically amounted to little more than lines drawn on a map by some Mexican bureaucrat. The various indian tribes were still around and had a much more legitimate claim on the land. If I&rsquo;m way off, someone correct me.</p>

		<p>It is MEXICANS that have made MEXICO a mess. The PROBLEM is NOT the country. It IS the people. If by some magical act it were possible to instantly switch Mexico&rsquo;s population with Japan&rsquo;s, I would imagine in a few decades Mexico would be a very prosperous and peaceful place. The home islands of Japan would be a violent slum.</p>

		<p>Another example of willful blindness to what the late Garrett Hardin recognized as the &#8220;tragedy of the commons.&#8221;  If every Mexican, or even every third Mexican, left the &#8220;mess&#8221; that is their native country, in short order they would replicate that very mess here.  The U.S., ironically, would become Mexico all but in name.  Preservation of carrying capacity is necessary for the survival of any sovereign people.  </p>
<p>As for Mexicans, I wish them well in their effort to clean up their mess.  But that mess is not for us to clean.  </p>

<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t that some two dimensional thinking? If Mexico still had that turf, it would be the same third-world they&rsquo;ve made out of their current turf, and there would be that much less of that prosperous northern neighbor and its shopping malls (as far as I&rsquo;m concerned they can have them) to go around.</p>
<p>Oops. I bet they didn&rsquo;t think about that.</p>

<p>Also, when the Mexicans had that territory, they hardly wanted it.  At the time of the transfer of land as a war spoil in 1848, there were about 100,000 Mexicans living in all that territory, only 4,000 of them in what would become California.</p>
<p>There is another concern.  Using their parlance, we might have &#8220;stolen&#8221; that which the U.S. took in 1848.  But don&rsquo;t forget that five years later, the U.S. purchased a small strip of land that is now southern Arizona and far southwestern New Mexico (south of the current Gila River), called the Gadsden Purchase.  The reason for the purchase was to attain relatively flat land for a hypothetical southern E-W transcontinental railroad.</p>
<p>If we have to give back the southwest because we &#8220;stole&#8221; it from them, this means we can keep the Gadsden Purchase because we bought it fair and square.</p>

		<p>Mexico is a mess because it&rsquo;s full of Mexicans.  Haiti is a mess because it&rsquo;s full of Haitians.</p>
<p>After the Mexican - American war the treaty that ceded territory to  the United States also allowed all Mexicans living in those territories to stay and keep their property.  They could choose to be American or Mexican citizens, and became American citizens by default if they didn&rsquo;t explicitly choose.  Most became American citizens.  So it is a myth that Mexicans were deprived of their land.  All that happened was that the small population of Mexicans living in the area at that time changed governments.  But the Mexican government continues to promote the lie that we stole vast quantities of land from Mexicans and they have a right to take it back.<br/>

<p>FACE THE TRUTH! We PAID Mexico for the ceded territories. Never mind that Mexico, like any third-world nation could never amount to much on its own. Americans, NOT Mexicans, developed the Southwest with American capital, ingenuity&hellip; with American far-sighted vision and drive. Left to Mexico, the Southwestern States would be about as screwed up and impoverished as Mexico is today.</p>
<p>All these worthless third-world countries are alike. Their chronic inability to develop and make anything of their own lands&hellip; but ever ready to come here for the free ride&hellip; at OUR expense, of course!</p>
