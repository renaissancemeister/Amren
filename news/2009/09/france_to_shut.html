			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry Samuel, Telegraph (London), Sept. 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eric Besson, the immigration minister, said that a &#8220;very strong&#8221; rise in crime in the northern French port had provoked him to order that the &#8220;jungle&#8221; be cleared out by police backed by army units by the end of next week.</p>
<p>He said the message to migrants and people traffickers was: &#8220;You can no longer cross to England from Calais.&#8221; </p>
<p>He added: &#8220;The paradoxical situation for France is that we are trying to bar entry into the UK, which doesn&rsquo;t want these migrants, and we are lumbered with handling their departure.&#8221; </p>
<p>Natacha Bouchart, the mayor of Calais, has denounced a string of &#8220;serious offences&#8221; against residents in recent weeks in the area where a London journalism student was raped last summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will put an end to a lawless situation which had become unbearable for local people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Dismantling the jungle is psychologically important: we must say &#8216;stop&rsquo;.&#8221; </p>
<p>Up to 2,000 migrants, many of them from south Asia and the Middle East, live in makeshift tents and shelters in and around Calais. Every night dozens attempt to cross into Britain by jumping on trucks queuing for ferries or boarding trains going through the Channel tunnel.</p>
<p>The minister estimated that there were about 700 people in the jungle three months ago but that there were about 300 now following the closures of several squats. The squalid living conditions led to an epidemic of scabies last month.</p>
<p>About 170 people had made requests for asylum in France this year and a further 180 accepted voluntary return to their country of origin, he said.</p>
<p>The jungle has become a focal point for migrants since 2002, when Nicolas Sarkozy, the then interior minister, closed the notorious Red Cross centre at Sangatte.</p>
<p>Mr Besson promised the operation would be carried out humanely. An &#8220;individual solution&#8221; would be found for each person, including a voluntary return to the home country, an asylum request or expulsion.</p>
<p>There would be no forced returns of Afghans &#8220;if conditions do not allow this,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Aid groups working in the jungle said that the move was pointless and counter-productive. &#8220;This closure will in no way resolve the problem but simply shift it by perhaps a few kilometres,&#8221; said Vincent Lenoir of the Salaam charity. &#8220;Anyway, the migrants are spread around the whole country wherever there&rsquo;s a ferry link to England. Migrants already live in deplorable conditions and this will simply make their life a little harder.&#8221; </p>
<p>Jean-Pierre Boutoille, a Catholic abbot from the C-sur coalition of aid groups, said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s absurd and ridiculous to shut a shelter without planning for anything in its place,&#8221; said &#8220;Ever since they closed Sangatte, they regularly empty out and close the squats  &mdash;  it hasn&rsquo;t changed a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Boutoille said a UNHCR campaign launched in June to explain asylum and voluntary return procedures had led to a tripling of applications to return home.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing everything to create new problems just as things were starting to improve,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In April, French police arrested up to 200 migrants in a major swoop. But most were later freed.</p>
<p>On Thursday a large squat in Calais was closed and several migrants arrested in dunes near the jungle.</p>
<p>Mr Besson said the fight against underground networks would continue after the closure and other operations would follow &#8220;wherever there are camps along the coast&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the UK Border Agency said the closure and its timing were &#8220;matters for the French government&#8221; but added: &#8220;The UK supports action to tackle illegal immigration and to break up trafficking routes.&#8221; <br>

<p>The above comment seems to make sense to me. What good does it do to clamp down on only one such place, when they&rsquo;ll just go to another place down the coast?  The ONLY solution is to get rid of them ALL.  Anyway, these &#8220;migrants&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t be in France if France didn&rsquo;t allow them to get in, in the first place.</p>

		<p>The immigrants claim to be &#8216;asylum seekers&rsquo;, this is demonstrated to be an abject nonsense by the fact that, apparently, the immigrants can lounge around in France ready to pick and choose their departure date to the UK.<br>
 The real root cause are the insane &#8216;asylum&rsquo; laws in the UK that shower the immigrants with lavish freebies such as free housing, health, education, legal advice, cash benefits, free health-care etc.</p>

		<p>With the greatest respect to ER, I think the real competition between France and the UK is to see which country can descend into full-scale, Yugoslavia-style civil war and secessionism first (with Islam as the principal wedge driven into both societies).</p>
<p>That said, I wouldn&rsquo;t rule out valiant attempts by brave little Belgium or big, smug Sweden to have some major civil disruptions of their own (again with Islam as the catalyst) very soon.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a toss up.  <br>
But having visited Denmark this summer, I would  place it near the top of the list. It&rsquo;s even farther-gone than Sweden. And Norway is in very bad shape. </p>
<p>And then, of course, there&rsquo;s the Netherlands&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I have heard it said that Europe&rsquo;s problems are the result of the confluence of the Christian dread of evildoing and post Nazi-era guilt. I would add the loss of the fear of the unknown attributable to the arrogance of the scientific world view:<br>
any problem can be solved, you know.<br>
But what if the problem is the agressive attempt to undo the mindset of the solver?<br>
To substitute Mohammed for Newton in the pantheon?<br>
Another matter altogether.</p>

		<p>It looks as though France is copying Italy where there are massive problems with the &#8220;travellers&#8221; (mostly cAUk workers and non tax payers) from especially Romania causing big increases in crime and specially rapes, robberies (muggings) and murders.  Hopefully Brussels will NOT be able to ignore this fact and take the appropriate action such as EU citizens not being able to relocate without adequate funds (in a proper bank) and a job with a genuine letter of appointment (with acknowledged employer liabilites included) to go to as with all sensible movements of people. Perhaps, as we hope, the pendulium is swinging back to common sense and safety again.   </p>

		<p>Europe&rsquo;s demise is the direct, inevitable onsequence of the defeat of National Socialist Germany.<br>
Germany&rsquo;s defeat meant the defeat of the idea of European nations composed exclusively of the white European race, in their own homelands.<br>
Anybody who espouses this idea or even hints at such a thing is immediately denounced as a neo-Nazi, racist and anti-Semite and likely imprisoned.<br>
  <br>
The Allied landing in Normandy meant the final stab in the back of formerly white Europe.<br>
That is the real significance of D-Day.<br>

Really?  I was under the impression that Denmark and the DPP were actually trying to undo some of the damage.  Didn&rsquo;t think Norway was that bad either aside from Oslo being a third world city with 100% of sexual assaults being caused by racial foreigners.</p>
<p>Whereas Sweden has lost Malmo and large parts of Stockholm.</p>
<p>Ah well, at least there&rsquo;s always Estonia and Finland.  I expect Finland to hold out longer than any other scandinavian country, especially after hearing about how that one politician from the True Finns party called african asylum seekers &#8220;gang rapist criminals&#8221; and the party&rsquo;s popularity went up, not down.</p>
