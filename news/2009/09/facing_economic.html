FOR RELEASE ON:<br>
September 09, 2009<br>

<p>Despite the worst economic crisis in decades, renewed national security concerns in a post-9/11 world and an immigration policy many consider to be broken, a new Public Agenda survey finds immigrants themselves hold fast to their belief that America remains the land of opportunity and remain committed to becoming U.S. citizens. These voices are vital as legislators today lay the groundwork for passing immigration reform by President Obama&rsquo;s 2010 timeline.</p>
<p>The report released today by the nonpartisan nonprofit research organization, Public Agenda, follows up on a groundbreaking 2002 survey and tracks immigrants&rsquo; shifting attitudes during a tumultuous period. Conducted in May 2009 and funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, A Place to Call Home: What Immigrants Say Now About Their Life in America, utilized landline and cellular telephones along with oversamples to provide the widest perspective possible from more than 1,100 foreign-born adults from around the world. In particular, the survey provides new insight into the views of undocumented immigrants and Mexican and Muslim immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigrants infuse our society with energy, talent and renewed belief in our cherished institutions, the Constitution, the importance of an impartial justice system and participatory democracy,&#8221; said Vartan Gregorian, President of Carnegie Corporation of New York. &#8220;Their vitality, resilience, determination and the vibrant diversity they offer, nourishes us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Public Agenda has identified five key findings compared to immigrants&rsquo; viewpoints in 2002:</p>
<p>1. Concerns about discrimination have held stable and views of federal immigration services have improved.<blockquote>* Since 2002, there&rsquo;s been essentially no change in those who say there&rsquo;s discrimination against immigrants in the U.S. (62 percent say &#8220;some&#8221; or &#8220;a great deal&#8221;). But far fewer immigrants overall say they&rsquo;ve experienced much discrimination personally, with 25 percent reporting they&rsquo;ve run into &#8220;some&#8221; or &#8220;a great deal.&#8221; (a small but significant 5-point drop since 2002).</p>
<p>* Mexican and other Latin American immigrants are more likely than any other groups to say there&rsquo;s some or &#8220;a great deal&#8221; of discrimination against immigrants in the United States (75 percent of Mexicans and 72 percent of Central and South Americans). But they&rsquo;re no more likely to experience discrimination personally.</p>
<p>* Muslim immigrants are less likely to say there&rsquo;s much discrimination against immigrants. Some 64 percent of Muslim immigrants say there is little or no discrimination against immigrants, compared to 32 percent of other immigrants.</p>
<p>* Since 2002, the number of people giving positive ratings to federal immigration officials rose to 58 percent from 48 percent and 58 percent of immigrants say it is easy to get information about immigration and naturalization issues from the government, with 21 percent who say it&rsquo;s &#8220;very easy.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>2. While economic worries may be taking a toll on overall satisfaction, economic and practical concerns are much more important reasons to become a citizen than they were in 2002.<blockquote>* Among legal residents who are not U.S. citizens, the top reasons to become a citizen are &#8220;having equal rights and responsibilities&#8221; (80 percent) and the right to vote (78 percent).</p>
<p>* Yet there were significant increases in those who cite making it easier to get certain jobs (69 percent, up 14 points), to make it easier to travel (65 percent, up 14 points) and to qualify for government programs like Medicaid and food stamps (only 36 percent, the lowest on the scale, but still a 14-point increase from 2002).</p>
<p>* Half (52 percent) say it&rsquo;s &#8220;very hard&#8221; to get a job without knowing English, and a sizable number of immigrants (45 percent) came here without knowing the language. But they&rsquo;re aggressively trying to learn. Seven in 10 immigrants who knew very little or no English when they came to the United States say they&rsquo;ve taken English classes, up 23 points from 2002.</p>
<p>* Dissatisfaction with the economy may be driving one significant change from 2002. While an overwhelming 87 percent say they&rsquo;re happy with life in the U.S., the number who are &#8220;extremely happy&#8221; fell from 55 percent to 34 percent.<br>
</blockquote>3. Strong majorities of immigrants surveyed said they made the right choice in coming to the United States.<blockquote>* Majorities rated the U.S. as better than their birth country for earning a good living (88 percent), having a trusted legal system (70 percent), making good health care available (67 percent), having a good education system (62 percent), being a good place to raise children (55 percent) and on free speech (55 percent).</p>
<p>* Seven in 10 say they intend to make the U.S. their permanent home, and that given the chance they&rsquo;d do it all over again (a nine point decline from 2002).<br>
</blockquote>4. Even as ties to their birth country have grown stronger, immigrants say they can quickly adapt to the United States.<blockquote>* 77 percent say they felt comfortable in the U.S. within five years, and nearly half said it took less than two years.</p>
<p>* The number of immigrants who say they call home at least once a week rose from 28 percent to 40 percent, perhaps due to improved telecommunications.</p>
<p>* Those who send money to the birth country &#8220;once in a while&#8221; increased 14 points, to 44 percent, while those who say they never send money fell from 55 percent to 37 percent.<br>
</blockquote>5. Immigrants support a range of reform proposals, although support can change by age and ethnic group.<blockquote>* Seven in ten (72 percent) say that the government should offer a path to citizenship, i.e. a way for illegal immigrants with no criminal record and who have shown a commitment to the United States to become citizens.</p>
<p>* Some 84 percent support a guest worker program, and 61 percent strongly favor it.</p>
<p>* Mexicans are more likely to support a path to citizenship (84 percent), compared to only 62 percent of Middle Easterners, 54 percent of East Asians, and 48 percent of South Asians in favor. Support also declines as people grow older: 85 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds favor the path to citizenship, but only 56 percent of those 65 and older do.</blockquote></p>

		<p>The irony of all this is that as the United States admits more and more non-whites from the third world, this will dilute wage and salary standards, thereby making the American Dream less and less of a dream.</p>

Third-worlders want to move to the United States, and other white-majority (for now, anyhow) countries for the simple reason that where whites are, conditions are better than in non-white majority countries, regardless of economic circumstances or practically any other problem. Of course, many Asian countries are in relatively good shape too, and I figure that Africans would flock there were it not for the fact that Asians, unlike whites, are not burdened by feelings of racial guilt.</p>
<p>How many third-world newcomers want to move to Detroit, Camden, or any of the other American cities that are majority black? I notice that Minneapolis now has the largest concentration of Somalis outside Somalia. They moved to Minneapolis because there weren&rsquo;t a lot of third-worlders, including other blacks, there at the time (it&rsquo;s a different story now, of course). I have noticed that Somalis have a habit of eschewing black zones and heading to lily-white communities in whatever first world nation they are allowed into. They know that&rsquo;s where peace &amp; prosperity can be found.<br>

<p>Oh really. It&rsquo;s funny, all these people claim &#8220;discrimination&#8221; but they keep coming. </p>
<p>&#8220;Mexicans are more likely to support a path to citizenship &#8220;</p>
<p>There already IS a path to citizenship, it&rsquo;s called going through the normal immigration process. What they want is amnesty and to jump the line.</p>

<p>Vartan, you are full of it. These immigrants couldn&rsquo;t name anyone in the US govt besides Obama, never read the Constitution, and expect the govt to take care of them forever. </p>
<p>Free enterprise? Forget it. And appreciation for what the Pilgrims and the Founding Fathers did, well, who the h are they?<br>
Just dead white men who descendents want to keep America&rsquo;s wealth to themselves and not give it to brown immigrants who deserve it because, well, they want America&rsquo;s wealth!</p>

		<p>This shows the biggest &#8216;white supremacists&rsquo; are Mexicans and Muslims and Indians and Asians.  They hate their own third world mess and they will crowd into the wheel-well of an airplane just to be near us.  </p>
<p>What a nice back-handed compliment they offer up:  &#8220;We&rsquo;ve messed up our land and your lily-white land is so nice and lush and prosperous, may we please come in?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Americans used to be the most giving, welcoming nation on the globe. We&rsquo;d still like to be, but you can only take advantage of a people or a nation for so long before they learn to start protecting themselves first. <br>
Now many Americans would like to take the mawkish poem off the base of the Statue of Liberty and replace her torch with a sword. </p>

		<p>Vartan Gregorian-a LEGAL immigrant from the Iranian upper class-is pushing the bold facelie that Native Born White Americans would be worse off if the non-white LEGAL imigrants were not here.Call it for what it is, a bold face lie.</p>
<p>So the numbers show that an overwhelming mnajority of non-white LEGAL immigrants want to LEGALIZE their illegal brethren. Numbersusa.com makes the case for immigration restrction because it believes that immigrants would be hurt by amnesty&hellip;in numbersusa.com&rsquo;s universe,Native Born White Americans do not exist even though they are the racial group most strongly opposed to post-1965 immigration policy.What a despicable organization.</p>
<p>Non-white LEGAL immigrants are waging a vicious race war against the majority Native Born White American population. They want to increase their numbers through immigration so that at the voting both they can vote for the race raceplacement of the majority Native Born White </p>

		<p>The bigger questions is Why should we CARE what the legal and illegal immigrants think of our reception to them, or the way INS treats them?  All WE should care about is their view of us FROM ACROSS THE BORDER.  That&rsquo;s the only view I wish them to have.  We are no longer trying to populate a vast frontier and wilderness.  The only wild-erness in the US today is the hispanic and black ghettos, where the rule of law is nonexistent and the inhabitants thumb their noses at the host country these parasites suck the life from.  Get them out of here.  And keep them out.  </p>

		<p>The problem with this survey is that it is a self-selected group: legal immigrants who have bothered to come here to the USA.</p>
<p>They should have polled a large number of people in the home country. That might give a different picture&hellip; because of the fact that immigration hit a peak around 2001 and has actually been falling since then, aside from a large one-off spike in 2007 due to a fee increase. You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell this by simply looking at plain legal immigration figures by year, because the INS (or whatever it&rsquo;s called now) has been draining a backlog which had built up in the 1990s, inflating the numbers. But yes&hellip; the demand to immigrate here has fallen, and will likely continue to as the Great Recession wears on.</p>
<p>Also&hellip; keep in mind that Third World immigration is mainly chain immigration based upon family members of existing immigrants. Birth rates in the Third World 40-50 years ago (when most immigrants in the late 1990s were born) were very high (six children per woman), meaning lots of brothers, sisters, children, nieces, and nephews to sponsor and bring in. But now, we&rsquo;re getting Third World immigrants born (on average) 25-35 years ago, with only about half as many relatives as those earlier immigrants&hellip; and family ties are likely to be weaker even than that. In fact, chain migration from Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Poland (the only white country for which we did have chain migration), significant in the 1990s, has already ended.</p>
