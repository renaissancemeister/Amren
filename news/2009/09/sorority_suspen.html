			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emerald Catron, lemondrop.com, August 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>We feel sick after learning that a sorority at Colorado State University has been suspended over allegations of extreme hazing, and not just because its methods included starving pledges and forcing them to eat cat food.</p>
<p>CSU&rsquo;s Omicron Omicron chapter of Zeta Phi Beta will no longer be recognized officially by the institution, after an investigation uncovered its unorthodox initiation rituals. (Hazing is officially banned by members of the Greek collegiate system but is quite common  &mdash;  a recent documentary, &#8220;Haze,&#8221; profiles a related death.)</p>
<p>According to a 56-page police report obtained by the Rocky Mountain Collegian, pledges were forced to physically exert themselves to such an extreme that one of them needed medical attention. They were also deprived of sleep and food .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless they wanted to eat cat food, that is.</p>
<p><b>Starvation and Sit-Ups</b></p>
<p>Allegedly leading the torture was the chapter president and member of student government, Adesuwa Elaiho. According to one pledge, Elaiho &#8220;had us at her apartment for three days straight. No sleep, no food. I threw up because I was so hungry.&#8221; In addition to making one of the pledges write her academic papers, the president also made the pledges eat so many onions that two of them threw up.</p>
<p>According to CSU detective Adam Smith, hazing at the hands of Elaiho took place on multiple occasions. He added, &#8220;The physical activity included running, push-ups, wall-sits and other strenuous calisthenics, and were clearly designed as initiation into the Zeta sorority.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These events clearly caused risk of bodily injuries to the parties involved,&#8221; especially one girl with kidney problems who repeatedly lost consciousness.</p>
<p><b>Power Gone Sour</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The absurd part is that a lot of women do this so they can add leadership skills and volunteerism on their résumés. But with the wooden-paddle-spanking the Greek system is getting in the press, who&rsquo;s going to notice how much they may have raised as social chair?</p>
<p>According to the Zeta Phi Beta Web site: &#8220;Membership in Zeta Phi Beta Sorority is a living and learning experience for women with shared values and objectives. You will have the opportunity to be involved in a wide range of activities where you can use your unique talents and knowledge to contribute to the chapter and your community.&#8221; Really? {snip}</p>

		<p>The story is not over yet.  The sorority will yell racism and racial profiling, and then the suspension will be reversed.</p>

		<p>I went to their web site and slummed it a little bit. Interesting to say the least. Can anybody out there tell me what the designation of &#8220;Grand Basileus&#8221; means in this organization? What is a &#8220;Basileus&#8221;?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of fraternities or sororities to begin with, because of their cliquish nature, but doesn&rsquo;t it seem strange for blacks to have sororities? After all, black folks are the ones who have demanded acceptance into all white &#8220;cliques&#8221; (which aren&rsquo;t really cliques at all but basic rules that make civilization possible). Therefore, for blacks to have exclusive groups themselves can only come off as hypocritical in the extreme. </p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not deluded enough not to realize that there undoubtedly are and always were powerful pecking orders among African tribes and societies, but at least have the courtesy and decency not to stay here and then tell the white man how to run his own society.</p>

		<p>Black, White or Grey no one can force you to starve or eat cat food.  If you do not like the hazing activities just don&rsquo;t join the soroity.  </p>

<p>Basileus means king in Greek. They likely intended basilea (queen), but being semi-literate black college chicks simply misappropriated the term.</p>

		<p>Sounds like the CIA, FBI, NSA, &#8220;Xe&#8221; (formerly Blackwater), etc. are using this sorority as a training ground.</p>
<p>As for the wooden paddle, one can imagine dozens of black women in their underwear waiting to get swatted repeatedly, and having to respond to each swat with &#8220;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am, may I have another?&#8221; (think Kevin Bacon in <i>Animal House</i>).</p>

<p>Thank you for that laugh PBL! laughter is needed here in Afghanistan. BTW, It would appear that the U.S.Army is 60% or more black.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s rather enlightening to notice in every news event regarding blacks how the mention of race is either included or excluded depending on whether it is to their advantage or disadvantage to use it. If mentioning race helps get them what they want they will use it, milk it to death and turn it into about nothing BUT race. If it is detrimental to them or their cause, they hide the mention of race at all costs.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve long been surprised that the practice of &#8220;branding&#8221; by Black fraternities has never created much of a national outrage. I&rsquo;m not talking about a little welt. I&rsquo;m talking about a major scarring pattern (roughly 1/4&#8221; lines going several inches high and wide in the shape of their fraternity logo)created by red-hot metal meeting exposed flesh. You&rsquo;ll see them during any NFL football game where the players are wearing short sleeves with exposed bicepts.</p>
