<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An 18-year-old Hofstra University student was raped on campus, police said Monday, and four of the five suspects, including another Hofstra student, were arrested and charged.</p>
<p>The suspect from Hofstra  &mdash;  Rondell Bedward, 21, of 578 E. 141 St., Apt. 1A, the Bronx  &mdash;  was charged with five counts of first-degree rape. Stalin Felipe, 19, of 3150 Kingsbridge Ave., Apt. 3F, Bronx, was charged with five counts of first-degree rape, and first-degree attempted criminal sexual act.</p>
<p>Jesus L. Ortiz, 19, of 4373 Katonah Ave., Bronx, was charged with five counts of first-degree rape, first-degree attempted criminal sexual act, and fourth-degree grand larceny. Kevin R. Taveras, 20, of 116 Lukens Ave., Brentwood, was charged with five counts of first-degree rape. Police are searching for a fifth suspect, officials said.</p>

		<p>In this case, the Hispanics are black.  &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; in the East Coast parlance tends to mean Afro-Caribbean.  On the west coast and in the mountain west, it tends to mean Chicano-Mestizo.</p>

		<p>Three Puerto Ricans and one American black working together. And people say these two groups can&rsquo;t unite. Well, maybe I&rsquo;m jumping the gun. They obviously share the same ancestry and same behaviors that seem common in the mother continent. It&rsquo;s much the same here in L.A.. Mexicans and other mestizos, or blacks committing gang rapes. It must be some type of animalistic impulse.  That&rsquo;s the only way to explain it. </p>

		<p>  &mdash;  DUKE  asked:   <b>Who names their kid &lsquo;Stalin&rsquo;? </b></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting question, right there. It hints to us something about what&rsquo;s going on in the Latin mentality, right under our noses.</p>
<p>Who names their kid Stalin?  Some Latins do.  Not Puerto Ricans   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s unlikely.  But Dominicans, Colombians, Venezuelans, very possibly.  In this case, probably Dominicans  (and thus probably the NY-born child of illegals). An anchor-baby named Stalin.  Hmmm. Something to think about.<br>
 <br>
Given the degree  of Marxist appeal in much of Latin America, such names as Stalin, Lenin, etc.(used as first names),  are quite popular in certain circles.  Especially among the semi-educated, pseudo-intellectuals who are drawn to Marxism. But these sons of the Caribbean in the photos are obviously not mestizos, so he&rsquo;s not Mexican.</p>
<p>So who would?  And from the Bronx?  My guess would be he&rsquo;s Dominican. Almost certainly.</p>

		<p>I agree with Question Diversity. What we have here are four Black and mulatto criminals. There is one Black criminal. The other three are Dominicans, mulattos probably. Just more Black crime. Lumping &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; and &#8220;Black&#8221; together here is really misleading.</p>

		<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t think Hispanics go in for gang rape all that much. That&rsquo;s pretty usually a Black type crime. One of their favorites, I may add.</p>

		<p>Does anyone know the race of the victim?  I read somewhere that the girl was dancing with one of these thugs at a party before the rape occured.  I know it sounds callous to say this, but I am starting to lose any sympathy for white girls who put themselves in these situations by associating with violent non-whites.  Considering how brainwashed and completely immoral many youth are these days, these 4 thugs could have probably gotten everything they apparently wanted by just asking.</p>

		<p>Gentlemen I am an allumnist of Hofstra and I can assure you that it is predominantly clean and white with a very liberal professorship.  The few blacks I had in my class always and with pure irony were recieved into the graduate programs with a good deal of benevolence from affirmative action, to put it mildly.  We are in a life and death struggle between the forces of decency, civility and genuine (measurable) progress on one side; and a force which is willing to tolerate the most heinous injustices in an attempt to coddle or ingratiate themselves with the swelling minorities. Its a no joke contest gentlemen and its winner take all.  The shots of Lexington/Concorde have rung, and they have been absorbed by our people for some time now, when, when will we return a volley!?</p>

		<p>No big deal for these guys. They&rsquo;ll do some time in jail and get out to continue their garbage.</p>
<p>I hate to say this, but too many White people never seem to learn that the line has been crossed a long time ago. Black and hispanic people have no place here and they don&rsquo;t care what they do or what happens to them. Prison is as good a place as any to be in as anywhere else to them.</p>
<p>I think though, that many White people are finally coming to understand the situation as it exists and will finally take a stand against this stuff. The alternative is abject slavery.</p>

		<p>Pretty simple cause and effect.  Black invited into college community as student due to affirmative action, and liberal idiocy.  Black maintains typical black behavior.  Invites friends to engage in typical black pass-time.  Gang rape. Essentially, this is no different than the cause and effect of mandating section 8 rental housing in every new development of single home dwellings for purchase.  Moving the thugs among us so they don&rsquo;t have to travel to commit their crimes.</p>

		<p>Hofstra is actually a decent commuter school, one of Long Island&rsquo;s best calling cards.  What it needs is a top-notch security force.  </p>
<p>Black and Hispanic crime on the nation&rsquo;s college campuses is a scandal.  Go to New Haven, Connecticut and see who&rsquo;s committing all the crime against white Yale students.  It isn&rsquo;t other students, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

		<p>I also am starting to feel less sympathy for white girls.  They put themselves in this position.  Its very funny, ever since Obama was elected ive notices 3 times the number of interracial couples.  And now they are young skinny white girls.  When will they stop disrespecting themselves?<br>
When I was in high school it was about 30% black, I was friends with many.  However, if a white girl dated a black guy no white guy would EVER date them.  <br>
White people are constantly insulted and diminished on TV and movies and its teaching our minorities to treat us that way in reality.  <br>
Start with your family.  Teach them to have self respect.<br>

		<p>My concern is that no matter how many whites get raped or beat-up, there will still be a lack of courage by our conservative leaders to address this problem in its entirety.  Some folks are going to have to martyr themselves and sacrifice some personal advantages as they weather a bristling attack by leftists and band-wagoners.  By Band-wagoners I mean of course those people who are conservative in mind but fear the leftist opposition and their powerful weapon of race playing that has scared many a public figure to reduce his thoughts on the matter or even side with the opposition in order to take some advantage.  Good luck men, we certainly have our work cut out for us.  </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought:  will this become a PC <i>cause celebre</i>  such as the Duke University rape case was? Will this case cause the multicultists to start a dialog on rape and race? </p>
<p>What we have here at Hofstra may be a not untypical case (assuming the accused are guilty) in terms of inter-racial rape. Now, if the PC did not make a production out of things like the Duke case, I&rsquo;d be willing to drop the topic. But you wonder if Whites can afford to drop such topics, given the way in which they are consistently being targeted by the multicult. i.e., if the Duke University case was supposed to tell us how in America &#8220;privileged&#8221; white men can trod upon minority women, then does this case show that the inverse is the reality? And can Whites afford to let themselves be consistently demonized while giving minorities a &#8220;pass&#8221;? That is a ticket to being reduced to second class citizenship.</p>
<p>Well, all the facts are not in yet. I do not want to pre-judge the case. But I did want to comment on the media circus, or lack thereof, surrounding it.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt; The 18-year-old victim had been dancing at Hofstra USA early Sunday morning when Bronx resident Jesus Ortiz, 19, allegedly grabbed her cellphone after a dance. Police Detective Lt. John Allen said, &#8220;She repeatedly asked for the cell phone but he was not responsive. He left the club. She followed him out of the club. The cell phone was taken to lure her away from the crowd.&#8221;&hellip; The victim followed Ortiz to a dorm (from gothamist.com)</p>
<p>She says she was just out dancing and he grabbed her phone - out of the blue. However, what&rsquo;s odd is that she &#8220;followed&#8221; him to his dorm. Why not tell the club bouncer &#8220;Hey, he won&rsquo;t give me my phone!&#8221; Who follows a stranger into the darkness at 1-2-3am and then goes into his dorm? That doesn&rsquo;t sound right. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying she deserved to get raped, of course, but this story she&rsquo;s telling doesn&rsquo;t hold water. I think she probably went home w/him in a drunken stupor and he and his buddies decided to do what they wanted. </p>

   &mdash;   Anon. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re jumping to an unwarranted conclusion here.  It doesn&rsquo;t say she followed him to &#8220;HIS&#8221; dorm. (Who knows if he even had a dorm?)  It says she followed him to  &#8220;a&#8221; dorm.  It could have a dorm in her own building! Any dorm!  And maybe it was very near by.  That&rsquo;s not made clear.</p>
<p>And why didn&rsquo;t she go to the bouncer? There could be a million reasons.  Maybe the bouncer wasn&rsquo;t available at that exact moment, or she didn&rsquo;t see him. Maybe she didn&rsquo;t want to escalate it and &#8220;make trouble.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s quite likely.  Maybe she was already friendly with this guy, or had some kind of personal relationship, and thought she could handle it privately. Who knows?  She must have known him at last a little if they had been dancing.</p>
<p>And finally, maybe there&rsquo;s more to it that she doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about. There often is.</p>

_________________________</p>
<p>Mr. Dumpty makes a very excellent point.  By wrangling over the issue of whether or not incidents such as these are &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;  we (even those of us who disagree with the basic concept of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;) &hellip; are playing into the hands of those who want to prepare us for assigning those categories enhanced status, and for new  &#8220;hate laws&#8221; that are still in the wings.  That&rsquo;s something to think about.</p>
<p>Yes, it is the wrong discussion. And the wrong approach.  Any crime is a crime, period. And that&rsquo;s how it should be.  But predation is an act, not a feeling, and it can happen to anyone, to any of us.   If you&rsquo;re the victim of  a crime,  whether or not &#8220;hate&#8221; was part of the motivation is really of very small comfort.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a similar case at Eastern Michigan University, but it&rsquo;s extraordinary in that the college officials told the victim&rsquo;s family that she had &#8220;passed away unexpectedly&#8221; in her dorm room, when actually they knew that she had been raped and murdered in her dorm room  &mdash;  incredible!</p>

<p>BLACK CRIMINALS PREYING ON WHITES IS A NATIONAL EPIDEMIC! </p>
<p>Just check the crime statistics broken down by race at the Dept. of Justice website.</p>
<p>The article just linked and the ones that follow were reprinted here at Amren.</p>
<p>Because in the following crimes the black criminals made reference to race (who cares! Who cares for what reason one is being brutalized!!), these would probably qualify as &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; in the states where whites can be victims of &#8220;hate crimes.&#8221; </p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t think &#8216;hate&#8221; should matter  &mdash;  what matters is that we are being ATTACKED. But I made this list for a post in mainstream media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the white boy, he looks like a victim,&#8221;</p>

		<p>The police and district attorney have dropped all charges as of September 17th.  The girl stated that the sex was consensual.  It was probably the drunken drugged orgy the feminazis were so enthusiastica about when they forced the colleges to end the practice of having single sex dorms 40 years ago.</p>

		<p>She lied. She had consensual sex with all four of those men and then falsely accused them of rape. The sex was captured on camera phone video, which shows its was obviously consensual. All four men have been released and exonerated. Hopefully, these clean-cut and undeniably innocent young men have learned a valuable lesson about cavorting with trashy little girls. </p>

		<p>Ooops!  It turns out to be another one of those famous false accusations.  It appears that what we have here is another case of a young white woman who decided to manipulate the system for her own advantage by playing on racial stereotypes.  Regardless of how much truth there is in those stereotypes, this sort of abuse really sets the public conscious back where true black on white crime is concerned.  </p>
<p>She will be sentenced, along with All of White America, to read &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#8221;  This woman deserves all our derision as do all those who manufacture false acusations against others.</p>

&#8220;She says she was just out dancing and he grabbed her phone - out of the blue. However, what&rsquo;s odd is that she &ldquo;followed&rdquo; him to his dorm. Why not tell the club bouncer &ldquo;Hey, he won&rsquo;t give me my phone!&rdquo; Who follows a stranger into the darkness at 1-2-3am and then goes into his dorm? That doesn&rsquo;t sound right. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying she deserved to get raped, of course, but this story she&rsquo;s telling doesn&rsquo;t hold water. I think she probably went home w/him in a drunken stupor and he and his buddies decided to do what they wanted.&#8221; </p>
<p>Anonymous at 5:24 PM - You are a prophet.  The cell phone thing did sound weird and I had supposed that she went consenually, but didn&rsquo;t like the jeering she got afterwards from her four &#8220;lovers.&#8221;  In today&rsquo;s world, it is not far fetched to imagine that there were cell phone photos taken and she was trying to protect herself with the rape accusation.  Only time will tell in the details.</p>
<p>Most of the gang rapes we hear about here and in England occur because white girls willingly go with a non-white to an apartment or some secluded place.  It is difficult to press charges when there are no real injuries, but a lot of diverse dna evidence left in and around her sex organs.</p>
<p>Young people, especially young women really need to clean up their personal lives and have some self-respect.  It is lack of self-respect in my opinion, that gets these girls into so much trouble.  Of course, the commercial media is not helping them much either.  All we see on tv is trash for entertainment and the department stores sell clothing that make young female children look like prostitutes.  All of this is way out of control and cannot produce happy results for anyone.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Nassau DA: Hofstra Student Made Up Gang Rape Story<br>
Charges Dropped Against 4 Men Under Arrest; Search For 5th Called Off; DA, Hempstead School Release Statements</p>
<p>Charges against the four men arrested have since been dropped.&#8221;</p>
<p>As was true for all the people who vilified and condemned the Duke lacrosse players, it is a good idea to wait a while before making strong statements. </p>
<p>However, because of all the real occurrences in the past, the allegations did seem plausible.</p>
