<h1>White Flees &#8216;SA Oppression&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren Cohen, Times (Johannesburg), September 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A WHITE South African man has been granted refugee status in Canada after an immigration board ruled that his &#8220;fear of persecution by African South Africans&#8221; was justified.</p>
<p>Brandon Huntley, 31, who grew up in Mowbray, Cape Town, made his refugee claim in April last year.</p>
<p>On Thursday, in Ottawa, Ontario, the only member of the immigration board to hear Huntley&rsquo;s application, William Davis, ruled that Huntley would &#8220;stick out like a sore thumb due to his colour in any part of the country&#8221;.</p>
<p>Davis added that the unemployed irrigation sprinkler salesman had given &#8220;clear and convincing&#8221; proof of the state&rsquo;s &#8220;inability or unwillingness to protect him&#8221;.</p>
<p>Huntley&rsquo;s lawyer, Russell Kaplan, said that he is a human-rights lawyer who emigrated to Canada 20 years ago to escape the apartheid government&rsquo;s discrimination against black South Africans.</p>
<p>Kaplan told The Times that Huntley had been attacked seven times in South Africa by black people who called him a &#8220;settler&#8221; and a &#8220;white dog&#8221;.</p>
<p>Kaplan&rsquo;s sister, Lara, who emigrated to Canada last year, testified about the torture and murder of her other brother, Robert, by robbers in South Africa in 1997. Both Lara and Huntley gave evidence in camera in a full-day hearing on August 18.</p>
<p>Between 30 and 40 newspaper clippings were presented as evidence of life in South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;One article exhibited was published in [the Daily Sun in 2004] by Africa Ka Mahamba. [It was] entitled &#8216;Taking from whites is not a crime&rsquo;,&#8221; Kaplan said.</p>
<p>The article quotes the leader of the &#8220;Uhuru cultural club&#8221; as telling youngsters who attended a Human Rights Day celebration to steal from whites because &#8220;it is the right thing to do&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The judgment was a direct criticism of the South African government,&#8221; Kaplan said.</p>
<p>He said that affirmative action and black economic empowerment were two of the aspects that were taken into account in considering Huntley&rsquo;s application for refugee status in Canada. &#8220;These legislated policies, even though there is an explanation for them, are discriminatory. &#8220;</p>
<p>Huntley first went to Canada on a six-month work permit in 2004, working as a carnival attendant. He returned in 2005, staying on illegally.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said it would have been &#8220;preferable, before such a decision was made, that the South African government&rsquo;s view was sought. &#8220;Quite clearly, the allegations are as preposterous as they are laughable  &mdash;  which they would be if they were not serious,&#8221; he said.<br>

<p>This is a legal precedent.  And if I am reading this article right, a black former South African Canadian immigrant judge who made this statement.</p>
<p>This will be interesting to watch.  It is important.  It may lead to a legal crack that we may exploit to eventually gain white only economic and even geographical zones. Certainly, Quebec and Ontario ought to be included in such a region as well as Saskatchewan, New England, north of the Alleghenies, The Old Northwest and The Northwest.</p>

		<p>Predictably, the South African government is denouncing the decision by Canada, accusing Canada of racism.</p>
<p>Pay no attention to the genocide of white farmers and civilians, thousands of whom have been savagely murdered by blacks. </p>
<p>The South African authorities are scared the word will get out before the World Cup of Soccer next June, and white tourists will not come.  </p>

		<p>Will the Obama Administration follow this example? Ha, Ha. We have let thousands from El Salvador arrive here as refugees from oppression. But whites from South Africa? After all, Nelson Mandela is God, and American visitors to South Africa kiss his royal derriere. Why would any white person flee the ANC paradise the godlike Mandela has created?</p>

		<p>Even the Republicans are discriminating against white SA refugees. I remember reading the comments of a Republican congressman stating that they should not be allowed in lest they &#8220;infect&#8221; the US with racism. I suppose we&rsquo;ll just stand by and watch this bloodbath. The young and the affluent will get out. The rest will be slaughtered. Our turn is comming.</p>

<p>This dude must be black.  Thank goodness he wasn&rsquo;t the one making the decision to grant refugee status.  Isn&rsquo;t it sad that a family must lose one sibling before the rest of the family can be saved.  I fear this decision is a fluke and not a trend of whites protecting whites.</p>

		<p>Never knew I&rsquo;d live to seriously wonder whether a White South African should really want to come to the United States or, for that matter, Canada.</p>
<p>As things stand now, South Africa&rsquo;s a hell-hole but how much better would it be to come here?</p>
<p>Those of us old enough to remember the good old days of the 1950&rsquo;s and early 1960&rsquo;s surely wouldn&rsquo;t want to migrate here if we weren&rsquo;t already stuck here.</p>
<p>Sad.  Very, very sad.</p>

<p>Since the ending of apartheid in 1994 there have been about <a href="http://sarahmaidofalbion.blogspot.com/2009/04/more-white-crosses-in-south-africa.html" rel="nofollow">3066 White South African farm murders</a> (not including urban killings)&hellip;. and the silent genocide continues up to this hour.

		<p>Funny how anybody fleeing third world hell hole conditions is granted asylum no hassle if they are not White, but here these White people have to sit through an all day hearing to plead their case. Luckily, at least this sets a legal precedent, but of course anybody White that follows in these steps will have to clear far higher hurdles than non-Whites. </p>

		<p>   Heard this on the radio today here in Australia which broadcasts news around the world.Its intesting in that hearing  comments on this story after a political analyst said most<br>
crime was `black on black` and that robbers are almost solely<br>
motivated by what the victim possess rather than his racial<br>
background&hellip;try telling that to thousands of white victims singled out for no apparent reason other than?&hellip;There was also inevitable mention of apartheid and black South Africa having `achieved` so much and now fearing a backlash and also a potentila `rift` between South Africa and Canada.</p>
<p>Actually many (mainly white) South<br>
Africans have emigrated here esp Perth, Melbourne and Sydney and from my own observations have achieved a great deal through hard work and/or  entrepreneurial zeal.Just a week ago in the local paper there was a story of one family of four who had fled with only suitcases a few years ago due to crime and security concerns.While it noted there success here it didnt bother questioning the nature of the `crime` problem in SA.With the upcoming World Cup it appears to be the ever lurking  elephant in the room.<br>
 Anyway cant wait to see those flashy colorful pictures of President Zuma bouncing round with his three  lovely wives and then reading in the much  smaller  black n white  print of all those soccer tourists being mugged and scammed on the way to the stadiums downtown in the `shantytowns`              </p>

		<p>Whiteplight @ 6:52 - no, it&rsquo;s not the  judge who was a former South African, but the lawyer, Kaplan, as I read it.  One of those bleeding-heart liberals who fled the nasty apartheid state, but who have no interest in actually living in the utopia they helped to create.</p>
<p>This is a fluke, and was only possible because somebody slipped up and only one member of the board turned up to hear the application. The precedent it sets is huge, because there are a few million more of us SA whites sticking out like sore thumbs here, who can now apply for asylum as well. That&rsquo;s why I expect this decision to be challenged and overturned in the courts.</p>

After my brother was murdered in a so-called car hijack, I got on a plane and left. If I had been a South African citizen I would have been stuck there unless I passed criteria to emigrate. </p>

<p>Actually, the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyer emigrated from South Africa <br>
to flee oppression against blacks, but Kaplan doesn&rsquo;t sound <br>
like a Xhosa name to me. </p>
<p>I think <b>the woman who is best able to tell us <br>
how to help the Afrikaaners is Adriana Stuijt. </b> She used to <br>
fight apartheid, and when it collapsed she basically fled the <br>
violence in South Africa and has been chronicling its descent <br>

No, Kaplan is not a Xhosa name. Nor Zulu either.</p>
