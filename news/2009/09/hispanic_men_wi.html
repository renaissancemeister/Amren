<h1><a href="https://azstarnet.com/allheadlines/310337">Hispanic Men Will Get Paid for School </a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Becky Pallack, Arizona Daily Star, Sept. 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pima Community College plans to pay Hispanic men to stay in school because their graduation rates are so low. </p>
<p>Under a new program, called Gain, 500 men will be paid $1,500 each for successfully completing classes and utilizing some support services. </p>
<p>Three private foundations are funding the program. Public tax money won&rsquo;t be used. </p>
<p>The idea is to turn around low retention and graduation rates among low-income Hispanic men, said Lorraine Morales, assistant vice chancellor. </p>
<p>Only 11 percent of Hispanic men who enroll at PCC finish their degree program within three years. The overall graduation rate is 23 percent. Another 8 percent in each group transfer to other Arizona colleges. </p>
<p>MDRC, a New York-based nonprofit research company, is studying similar programs at community colleges in New York, Ohio, New Mexico and California. It invited PCC to participate and brought in two private funders: the Phoenix-based Helios Education Foundation and the Detroit-based Kresge Foundation. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students who volunteer for the Gain program will get $150 when they enroll in classes. They&rsquo;ll get another $150 mid-semester if they&rsquo;ve stayed in school and used some support services, such as program orientations, tutoring, career counseling or time management and financial literacy workshops. </p>
<p>When they pass their classes, they&rsquo;ll receive the $1,200 balance. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When it comes to low graduation rates, part of the problem lies in preparation, said Morales, assistant PCC vice chancellor . </p>
<p>&#8220;This particular population doesn&rsquo;t really have a solid understanding of what the requirements are to be a college student,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Another part of the problem is cultural, she said.&#8221;A lot of the time they&rsquo;re hesitant to ask for help because the feeling is they should be able to take care of it themselves,&#8221; Morales said. </p>
<p>Valenzuela agreed. &#8220;Asking for help, from a man&rsquo;s point of view, is degrading,&#8221; he said, speaking generally. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DID YOU KNOW </p>
<p>PCC&rsquo;s student body is 31 percent Hispanic. </p>
<p>Pima Community College has been a Hispanic-Serving Institution since 1999. The U.S. Department of Education designation makes PCC eligible for Title V grant funds for improving academic outcomes for Hispanic and low-income students. </p>
<p>PCC has received $8 million since 2006.<br>

		<p>Meanwhile, my brother could not afford to buy all of his books for all of his classes because of the other costs of education. I wonder how much it would save Americans if Universities didn&rsquo;t educate the whole world. And now we are paying minorities to raise the price of education for everyone else. Insane. </p>

<p>Well then I am all for it!, our tax dollars won&rsquo;t be used to pay Jose to go to school, they will be used to provide grant money to &#8220;private foundations&#8221; who will pay Jose to go to school, after the private foundation takes out its cut of course.</p>
<p>From the MDRC website:</p>
<p>With an annual budget of more than $50 million, MDRC derives its revenues from a wide variety of sources. About half of MDRC&rsquo;s funding comes from federal, state, and international government contracts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdrc.org/about_finance.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.mdrc.org/about_finance.htm</a></p>
<p>In case your wondering the other half comes from other taxpayer funded entities. Yep it is certainly better to add two layers of middle men and blood suckers to make it seem &#8220;privately funded&#8221; rather than just funding the program directly.</p>

		<p>Certainly there are enough racially conscious whites to start up a fund for whites who excel and for white only scholarships.  Yeah, I know they have organizations for Irish Americans and Italian Americans etc. - but the equivalent of &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; would be &#8220;white&#8221; or &#8220;White&#8221;, just as the equivalent of &#8220;Mexican&#8221; would be &#8220;American&#8221;.  Would such an organization be able to leach public funds (as aj +2) describes?  Only with great difficulty and lawsuits but it&rsquo;s worth a try.</p>

<p>Really? While the Bill Gates, Dells, and Warren Buffets of the world play god with their earnings-diverted tax exempt foundations, I pay 66% in taxes (15% self employment, 4% state, 31% income, 6% sales, 10% property)to help make up the difference.</p>

		<p>First the gov&rsquo;t refuses to deport them when they&rsquo;re here illegally.</p>
<p>Then they get admitted to the colleges over whites w/better grades.</p>
<p>Next they get their tuition paid for by mostly white taxpers.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re being paid $1500 to not drop out? What&rsquo;s next, chauffered limo service to and from the school? <br>

		<p>More taxes wasted and causing seniors and other Americans hardship. The money for this stuff isn&rsquo;t free, it never is. Americans, many of whom don&rsquo;t seem to realize it, are the victims of a huge redistribution of wealth scheme. That&rsquo;s what the illegal immigration is, the massive legal immigration of people who arrive here and immediately go on welfare, and of course, almost all liberal programs. If politicians cared about Americans, they wouldn&rsquo;t continue to allow 120,000 people to enter the U.S. &#8220;legally&#8221;,EVERY SINGLE MONTH, and in this economy to boot. If it isn&rsquo;t treason, what is it??</p>

		<p>Well, there are probably many programs throughout the USA that rewards non-white immigrants, legal and/or illegal, with US taxpayer monies.  If you are Hispanic and are on the payroll of the City of Chicago, you are rewarded with a 5% bonus added to your yearly salary under the wonderful administration of Richard M. Daley, Mayor and his &#8216;rubber stamp&rsquo; City Council.  You don&rsquo;t really have to speak or write Spanish fluently, just have one of those Hispanic sounding surnames.  That 5% bonus may not sound like a lot but it sure counts upon your retirement after 20 or 30 years of employment.  Now of course, if you are bi-lingual in German, Polish, or Gaelic, that won&rsquo;t be covered.  And if you are a White male and speak Spanish at a Ph.D. level, that won&rsquo;t do you any good either.  </p>
<p>The Chicago Department of Public Health also has an unique program too for treating TB patients.  They send out public health nurses to their TB patients&rsquo; homes and we taxpayers pay those patients to take their TB medications in front of the nurse to insure they comply with their doctor&rsquo;s orders.  This is a policy from the Federal government&rsquo;s Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia.  These immigrants, legal or not, know a good thing when they see it.  </p>
<p>What really bugs me is the somnolence of the taxpayers of this country.</p>

		<p>If this is such a big problem, then the solution is to give every Hispanic resident of Tucson an associates degree as a civil right of his or her turning a certain age, perhaps early to mid 20s.  That way, all the social problems supposedly caused by low Hispanic graduation rates will go away.  </p>
<p>N&rsquo;est pas?</p>

		<p>This country is going through several undesirable demographic changes.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  A White population that is getting grayer every year with a plummeting birth rate.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  A rapidly growing non-White population that is NOT at all aging to due high rates of immigration, miscegenation, and high-birth rates.</p>
<p>Half of Hispanics in California are under the age of 26 with a birth rate well above replacement level. With more and more Hispanics of child-bearing age coming to the US every ear. </p>
<p>Half of all Whites in the US are over the age of 44. So the majority of our people are past child-bearing age with a low-birth rate.</p>
<p>Since half of minorities are under the age of 30, (particularly Hispanics) there population boom has just begun.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hispanics have demanded to the point now that just about everything public has to be in both English and Spanish now. White tax-payers take care of their half-a-dozen children.<br>
Now Hispanics are getting paid $1500 a piece to stay in school? What&rsquo;s next? That all Hispanics get a discount on everything just because they are non-White and apparently &#8220;oppressed&#8221;?</p>
<p>By the way, did poor low-income Italians, Russians, and Poles in NYC ever get paid to finish school?</p>

		<p>I have to add to what lakeview senior said. In Chicago, to be bilingual, the first language you must have spoken is Spanish. In my organization, Americans who lived for years in Spain, and speak like a good castilian, cannot get a biligual bonus. However, Pablo from the PR or mexico can. Furthermore their english is horrible. That is what life is like in the Socialist republic of Daley- formally, Chicago.</p>

<p>OR a lot of bullets when the time comes. This story is also typical in that said illegals (and blacks too) take 3 years to finish a 2 year course, and will be passed no matter the grade and get their money.</p>

		<p>So, those Latino men actually get paid, to stay in school, and graduate (or try to)?</p>
<p>Most of us have to pay, to go to school beyond hinghschool, and we have to study, so we don&rsquo;t get flunked. We eventually we graduate, we have to go to many srteesful job interviews, and if we are hired, THEN and only then, we get paid!</p>
<p>That program, as they call it, is simply laughable, I think.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what does the existence of such a program say about the talent and the motivation of those who benefit, from that same program?</p>

At $1500 a pop, you can buy a one way First Class plane ticket to Mexico, and you would still save a ton of tax payer dollars by not having them live here and supporting them from cradle to grave.</p>

<p>Translation: The hispanic students are basically a cash crop or herd so that more and more affirmative action women and minorities can get tax payer funded do nothing jobs sitting around community college offices all day.</p>
