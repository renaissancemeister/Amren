<h1>Suit Alleges Trusted Blacks Drew Minorities to High-Rate Loans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Kane, Washington Independent, Sept. 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the housing market began booming in the mid-2000s, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. teamed up with prominent African American commentator and PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley and financial author Kelvin Boston, the host of &#8220;Moneywise,&#8221; a multicultural financial affairs show, to host something called &#8220;Wealth Building&#8221; seminars in black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The seminars in some cities drew standing room only crowds, with numerous Wells Fargo representatives on hand, seated at carrels to meet one-on-one with potential borrowers who lined up after the speeches, which were usually held in hotels. The free, day-long events were heavily advertised in the black media, and launched in eight cities, including Baltimore, Chicago, Richmond, Va., and San Francisco.</p>
<p>But what appeared on the surface as a way to help black borrowers build wealth was actually just the opposite, according to a little-noticed explanation of the &#8220;Wealth Building&#8221; seminar strategy, contained in a lawsuit recently filed by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan.</p>
<p>Wells&rsquo; plan for the seminars all along was to target black borrowers for higher-cost subprime mortgages, not for wealth-building, the suit charged. And the seminars were a part of the bank&rsquo;s overall illegal and discriminatory practice of steering black and Hispanic borrowers into riskier and more expensive loans, the suit said.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to a former Wells Fargo Home Mortgage employee, one of these &#8216;Wealth Building&rsquo; seminars held in Maryland was planned for an audience that would be virtually all African American,&#8221; the suit said. &#8220;The plan for the seminar was for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage employees to talk about subprime mortgages, although they were directed by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage to use the term &#8216;alternative lending&rsquo; when marketing these products.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former employee, who is white, was scheduled to speak at the seminar, but was told by a manager that she was &#8220;too white,&#8221; and that only black employees could make presentations, the suit said.</p>
<p>Wells Fargo, one of the nation&rsquo;s largest mortgage lenders and a recipient of $25 billion in government bailout money, has denied all the charges in the Illinois suit, as well as other allegations of unfair lending. The bank did not respond to requests for comment on the seminars. Smiley, an author and advocate who hosts the late night talk show, &#8220;Tavis Smiley,&#8221; and who organizes the State of the Black Union symposiums each year, also declined comment.</p>
<p>Corbett pointed out that Wells&rsquo; outreach to the minority community through the seminars wasn&rsquo;t unusual. Lenders sponsoring financial literacy sessions, holding wealth building seminars, or contributing to local minority advocacy organizations, became a common marketing strategy as the subprime market grew. Some of the efforts were genuine, aimed at finding new customers in minority neighborhoods once deprived of credit. But sometimes they were used instead as a cover to push predatory loans, Corbett said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Corbett said that after the speakers finished, bank employees and other financial experts were offering credit checks, real estate counseling, and other kinds of assistance. Corbett said he also believes some employees were signing up people for loan pre-approvals, on the spot, though he couldn&rsquo;t be sure of what kind of loans they were. He said attendees lined up to talk to the Wells employees in both events. &#8220;If they weren&rsquo;t actually selling loans, they were setting up borrowers for the kill,&#8221;  Corbett said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2005, before the subprime crisis, Boston said, the main worry in the black community over mortgage lending was the banks were lagging behind in their lending to minority neighborhoods. He said expressed his concerns about this to Wells Fargo. Smiley, he said, also later raised questions about subprime lending tactics with the bank. &#8220;Tavis definitely had some dealings with them on this issue,&#8221; Boston said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in hindsight and with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, Boston said he has second thoughts about participating in the seminars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were we probably used? We probably were,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I had the chance to do it over again, would I do it in a different manner? Probably.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Illinois lawsuit against Wells is one of many such actions winding their way through the court system around the country, offering more details of alleged discriminatory tactics by lenders during the height of the subprime boom. As TWI reported last week, housing advocates call these lawsuits the &#8220;smoking guns&#8221; of the housing crisis, providing what they see as proof that lenders deliberately targeted minorities for high-rate and risky subprime mortgages, while white borrowers with similar incomes and credit scores received lower-cost loans.</p>
<p>In a city of Baltimore lawsuit against Wells, former employees charged that Wells Fargo loan officers referred to minority borrowers as &#8220;mud people&#8221; and called subprime mortgages &#8220;ghetto loans.&#8221; But some prominent black bloggers find the &#8220;wealth building&#8221; seminars just as egregious, and question why Smiley, Boston, and anyone else who participated in them hasn&rsquo;t been called on further to account for their actions.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Tavis Smiley was white, Wells Fargo and &#8216;Ghetto Loans&rsquo; would be front page news,&#8221; wrote Genma Stringer Holmes, a Nashville, Tenn., business owner and blogger who has blasted out several posts on the seminars.</p>

		<p>Subprime mortgages were not &#8220;higher cost.&#8221;  The word &#8220;subprime&#8221; means under the prime rate, therefore the design was for borrowers to increase marginally compared to a conventional mortgage their equity in the house over time.  It was about &#8220;wealth building.&#8221;  Except the funny little flaw that drawing mortgages of $720,000 for those claiming they make $14,000 a year, not doing a credit check, and assuming they will be able to pay more than their entire after-tax income on the payments led to trouble.</p>

<p>More proof that when it comes to blacks, it&rsquo;s damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;If Tavis Smiley was white, Wells Fargo and &lsquo;Ghetto Loans&rsquo; would be front page news,&#8221;</i></p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s nice to see them going after Mr. Smiley. He earned his 30 pieces of silver by selling out blacks to &#8220;predatory&#8221; lenders. Let&rsquo;s hope the black community turns on him for profiting off their own demands and recklessness.</p>

		<p> You are damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t. If you offer credit to low income poor credit customers you have to charge higher rates it&rsquo;s logical and only makes sense if you turn down loans to poor credit customers you get burned by the activists when you turn them down. There&rsquo;s only one thing to do give them a good  credit low interest loan they don&rsquo;t deserve but then your stockholders will kill you when their investments loose money.</p>

		<p>Whatever your race, if you sign a piece of paper borrowing way more money than you could possibly pay back, you deserve what you get.  Period  Don&rsquo;t we all get a chance to go to the free public schools and learn basic math?  Quit whining.  <br>

<p>Here we see clear discrimination against whites.  But because discrimination against whites is so pervasive, it can only be noted if it somehow also adversely affects blacks.</p>

		<p>I love the term &#8220;predatory lending,&#8221; as though a lender would deliberately make loans he knows won&rsquo;t be repaid.  What a great scam!  Banks can now make money by getting stiffed by borrowers!  Why didn&rsquo;t anybody think of this before?</p>
<p>In simple point of fact, Wells and other lenders did go after the sub-prime market secure in the belief that endless real-estate appreciation would protect their interests and those of their borrowers.  Well, the bubble burst, and when it did it left many sub-prime borrowers, as well as many triple-A borrowers, upside down in their mortgages.</p>
<p>Of course, if Wells and others had declined to aggressively pursue subprime borrowers they would have been prosecuted for &#8220;red-lining,&#8221; which is to saying having a loan portfolio insufficient in the percentage of minority borrowers. </p>

		<p>What`s new here? Blacks kill each other 10 times as often as they do whites. The sell each other drugs which destroy their own communities. They riot and burn down the stores that serve them. Why shouldn`t race hustlers like Smiley et.al.get a piece of the action. This follows the long history of blacks kidnapping their brothers and selling them to the slavers. The only group that doesn`t prey on it`s own are the Black Muslims.The NAACP treasury is looted everytime a new president takes over. Whenever some liberal program to help blacks is led by a black man. he ends up riding in a limo, his or the Marshall`s.<br>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t they sue Janet Reno, Bill clinton and every employee of the civil rights (but not for whites) division of the department of justice for the last 20 years?</p>
<p>It was Reno who issued draconian orders that banks increase their home mortgages to blacks and hispanics who could not possible afford the property under pain of enormous fines and sanctions.</p>
<p>The civil rights (but not for Whites) division of the DOJ enforced this order vigorously.  The banks had to find a way to survive so the came up with all these methods which have backfired and caused the mortgage meltdown.</p>
<p>I believe an additional reason for these mortgages, especially to hispanics and other immigrants was to keep property prices artificially high so that state, city and county governments can keep collecting the property taxes that support the poverty stricken immigrants.</p>
<p>From schooling, to free day care, to more buses and drivers, to food stamps, free health care, on and on, governments are in a race to tax Americans to get the money used to support low wage and welfare immigrants.</p>
<p>During the 1930&rsquo;s depression wages fell and many were out of work.  But the cost of housing also fell in proportion to wages.<br>
So people out of work could still find housing on their meager unemployment and welfare benefits because rents were adjusted to the low income of most of the population.</p>
<p>But now we have a situation where the immigrants drive down wages and fill the welfare rolls, real wages adjusted for inflation haven&rsquo;t risen for 35 years, there is no such thing as a living wage lower middle class any more but housing costs are unnaturally high due to immigrants living 20 people in a 2 bedroom 1,200 sq ft house.</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity:<br>
The definition of that term is not intuitive and you have it backwards. Subprime means lower than the prime market, which pays the lowest rates.</p>
<p>Subprime Loan: A type of loan that is offered at a rate above prime to individuals who do not qualify for prime rate loans. Quite often, subprime borrowers are often turned away from traditional lenders because of their low credit ratings or other factors that suggest that they have a reasonable chance of defaulting on the debt repayment.</p>

		<p>Joe:  My bad.  I do know that a lot of these &#8220;subprime&#8221; loans did start with low teaser rates, and that&rsquo;s also what threw a lot of borrowers.  They could make the payments with the low teaser rate, but once the rate returned to the contractual normal, they couldn&rsquo;t make the payments.</p>

		<p>The problem here is easy to resolve. blacks want loans, they just don&rsquo;t want to pay them back. This is how they seem to feel about everything, it&rsquo;s owed to them.</p>

		<p>The coercion of lenders by the Justice Department to write loans to borrowers who couldn&rsquo;t really afford them could not possibly have come at a worse time.  The high tech stock boom of the 1990s had collapsed, and all that money had to chase a different form of investment.  The result was a massive speculative bubble in real-estate.  The borrowers took out adjustable-rate loans on real-estate that was grossly over-valued.  The construction industry stepped in and began a flurry of new construction in an attempt to profit from the speculative boom themselves, in some areas building three times more homes than the actual demand.  Speculative bubbles always collapse, and the construction industry&rsquo;s ridiculous overbuilding accelerated and worsened it.  I suspect we are now seeing a speculative boom in commodities prices (like copper).</p>
<p>Buying a home is the most important financial decision most people will ever make.  People who didn&rsquo;t do their homework got burned, the way careless people always do, but one segment of these buyers, notorious for their victim/entitlement mentality is screeching &#8220;Poor little black me&#8221;.  They do this all the time; why should the mortgage meltdown be any different?</p>
