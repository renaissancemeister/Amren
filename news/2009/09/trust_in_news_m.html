<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Trust in news media has reached a new low, with record numbers of Americans saying reporting is inaccurate, biased and shaped by special interests, according to a survey set to be released Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Negative opinions grew since 2007 among both major parties, but significantly more so among Democrats. The percentage of Democrats calling the media inaccurate rose to 59, from 43; the percentage who said the media took sides rose to 67, from 54.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>With left-wing yellow journalistic rags failing all across the country, there can be no greater statement that they no longer have the confidence of their readers.</p>
<p>The internet is causing a few to lose readers, but the greatest factor is a loss of trust.</p>
<p>And why not?  There were probably 2 million people in D.C. over the weekend, yet few reported anything beyond a few critical remarks, with the exception of Fox News.  The newspapers seem to have denied the event occurred.</p>
<p>This could be the start of something big.  </p>
<p>For all of you who are constantly complaining about wanting some action, go to www.resistnet.com or quit complaining.</p>
<p>Before you mention it, the groups aren&rsquo;t racially aware&hellip;.on the surface&hellip;but before the racists in the Obama dministration are through with their blatant biases and anti-white actions, the groups will have no choice but defend themselves along racial lines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good beginning.</p>

What&rsquo;s significant to me is that democrats&rsquo; negative opinions are growing.</p>
<p>AR readers are well aware of how liberal the news media are. That democrats have negative opinions speaks to their mental state.</p>
<p>If they can&rsquo;t see the truth as to how liberal the press is, then they aren&rsquo;t living in the same world as us.</p>

		<p>This is fantastic to hear. I truly hope people realize they are being manipulated by elite, con artists. Regarding manipulation, these people are absolutely masterful at times. </p>

		<p>What I heard in an email from a fellow Amrener is that 2 million Tea Party Patriots showed up at the White House yesterday.  But at work tonight, no one had heard about it and there happened to be a USA Today rag in the break room,.. NOT A PEEP in there either!   I think people are finally getting smart to news media, now they have to wake up to the constant propaganda on the TV.  I can&rsquo;t wait until every rag paper goes out of business!</p>

		<p>With Obama slipping in the polls among some white &#8220;moderates&#8221; and women, the media has taken a slight step back from their absolute deification of him.  Democrats don&rsquo;t like this one bit, and read any left wing website and you&rsquo;ll see hysterical conspiracy theories about a vast, all-powerful, right wing media cabal trying to unseat their beloved dear leader.  Since he was elected with eyes deliberately averted to any unpleasant reality, his house of cards is extremely fragile.  No reality of any sort must intrude.</p>

		<p>Of course we don&rsquo;t trust the media.  It has been anti-white for decades now.  The mainstream media covers up horrible, anti-white hate crimes and turns some of them, such as the Jena 6, into victims!  I stopped watching the news about 10 years ago and rely solely on the internet.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s howlingly funny about the continuing demise of metro dailies in this country is that the most expensive paper of the lot, the Wall Street Journal, gains in print circulation every day.</p>
<p>There are only two explanations for this:  First is the vastly superior caliber of the reporting in the Journal.  Second, is the obvious fact that the Journal&rsquo;s not anybody&rsquo;s mouthpiece.  They expose political malfeasance on both the left and right, thought this of course makes them a right-wing mouthpiece to those on the left.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t waste my time reading a single other metro daily.</p>

		<p>The media in this country has gone their own way. I don&rsquo;t know anyone left, moderate, or right that trusts them anymore to report the news without bias. Not a single person.</p>

		<p>We can&rsquo;t trust the media? Geez, I didn&rsquo;t know that. I mean just because the media deliberately downplayed Ron Paul&rsquo;s viability since he was too squeaky-clean for the media. Just because the media passes the vilest, most horrific anti-White crimes by Blacks off as &#8220;street crimes&#8221;, while crucifying any White man or woman for even making a mild joke at Blacks&rsquo; expense. I mean just because the media IGNORED the recent Tea Party demonstrations since these people had the audacity to protest our government&rsquo;s out-of-control deficit spending policy&hellip;</p>
<p>Shucks, that ain&rsquo;t no gol-durn reason for us to distrust the media, or is it&hellip; ?</p>

		<p>The senior editors of the global MSM are a bunch of self confessed neo-socialists (Commies) and traitors to any idea of the nation state. This applies in the US, UK and Europe, where by slow and deliberate mis-information we are being duped into thinking that a 1 world state is good for all. </p>
<p>Anything that detracts national borders, races and peoples from living together as a homogenous people is a crime. Hasn&rsquo;t history shown in countless instances that any society that is invaded by non-indigenous peoples will always fail?</p>
<p>These are the same people that think everyone in every race is equal. Clearly races are not equal but they are pushing us to a point where contesting these views amounts to a criminal offence. It is here already and will not go away.<br>

		<p>Has anyone noticed that the faux right media outlets have moved more to the right?  I was passing by someone&rsquo;s radio at work and heard Rush Limbaugh talk about the bus beating incident in racialist terms more or less.  Yes, that&rsquo;s right, the king neocon himself sounded like a blogger on American Renaissance. It&rsquo;s nice that things are changing but I suspect they&rsquo;re more concerned about the 2010 elections and a possible shift in our foreign policy in the Middle East. </p>

		<p>  The talking heads on CNN crowned Obama King before &#8220;WE THE PEOPLE&#8221; even voted. The Presidential debates are the biggest joke on earth. Ron Paul made more sense than anybody,but he was marginalized and Ignored. It was an obvious SET-UP to make the Presidential race between Mccain and Obama from the start. There were NO REAL DEBATES about anything. All of the questions were carefully manipulated and massaged to play to Obamas strengths,while Ignoring his failings,and his associations with highly questionable Individuals. The Mainstream Media Is nothing more than a cheerleader for the far left wing In this country. These marches are just the beginning. You will live to see history made &hellip;.</p>

		<p>Do most blacks and Hispanics even watch TV news or read newspapers or news websites?  </p>
<p>When blacks and hispanics go to the library, they are either looking at entertainment sites on the internet, or checking out videos for their kids.  Some of the Hispanics where I used to live (in the Deep South) used to bring the kids over after lunch every day during Air Conditioning Season to cool off without running up their personal electric bill.</p>
<p>I know that low income people tend to run the television all day long, but I&rsquo;m not sure that they watch the news at all.  Most of the &#8220;non-elite&#8221; blacks and Hispanics that I have known didn&rsquo;t know beans about current events, so there is really no reason to believe that they are interested in the news, or that they watch it on any sort of regular basis.</p>
