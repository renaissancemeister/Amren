<h1><a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/703076">Racial Bias Exists on Police Force, Chief Says</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robyn Doolittle, Toronto Star, September 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Seven years ago, the Toronto police union fervently denied racial bias existed within its ranks and was prepared to sue those who claimed otherwise. Fast-forward to today and Chief Bill Blair acknowledges that racial profiling is a problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why a panel of community leaders and legal experts is gathered at the new police college for a diversity conference Wednesday hosted by the Toronto Police Service to discuss issues of diversity and racism among police officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism is a human failing. Racial profiling can occur. We&rsquo;ve acknowledged that right upfront and that has really enabled us to work with our community partners to do something about it,&#8221; said Blair, who will speak at the conference&rsquo;s opening ceremonies.</p>
<p>In 2002, when the Star ran a series of award-winning articles exposing racial bias on the force, then-chief Julian Fantino flatly denied it existed. The police union launched a $2.7 billion class-action libel lawsuit against the Star. It eventually was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada, which upheld a previous decision by the Ontario Superior Court.</p>
<p>But over the past five years, the Toronto police force has experienced a renaissance in the diversity department.</p>
<p>And it began at the top with Blair.</p>
<p>In 2005, when the police board began its search for the next chief, it made it a priority to hire someone with a commitment to diversity issues, said chair Alok Mukherjee.</p>
<p>Efforts had been made in the past to address the subject, but progress was minimal. In the early 1990s, the board passed its first race relations policy. An outside consultant was brought in to develop and design diversity training for officers. It was also around this time that chief William McCormack created an aboriginal peacekeeping unit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some steps were taken at that time, said Mukherjee, but &#8220;my sense is that what didn&rsquo;t happen is a very coordinated and systematic effort to deal with the issues that we&rsquo;re now trying to face.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a two-front undertaking.</p>
<p>On one side, the board has overhauled its human resources practices, particularly relating to recruitment and promotions. Officers are now going door to door in various ethnic enclaves, promoting careers in policing and educating anyone who is interested in how to get started. The force also holds women-only recruitment sessions. The results, says Andr√© Goh, who heads the Diversity Management Unit, are in the numbers.</p>
<p>Before Blair&rsquo;s time, white males made up between 85 and 90 per cent of the average recruitment class. Today, women and visible minorities account for anywhere between 40 and 60 per cent of new officers.</p>
<p>But recruitment is only part of the puzzle, said Mukherjee.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the Toronto Police Service invited the Ontario Human Rights Commission to review all of the organization&rsquo;s policies and procedures. That review is still ongoing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the force has fully embraced a community-based policing model, which is putting front-line officers in a prevention role, rather than solely focusing on enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our responsibility as police officers is not just safe communities. We have a role in social justice as well,&#8221; said Blair.</p>
<p>And the diversity conversations aren&rsquo;t just happening in Toronto.</p>
<p>The majority of police forces across the country operate some form of race relations unit. In addition, many are finding innovative ways to train officers.</p>
<p>In York Region, the service has created a Places of Worship Tour, a program that takes its officers to various religious centres across the region, said Insp. Ricky Veerappan, who heads the Diversity and Cultural Resources Bureau.</p>
<p>Doug Corrigan, president of the Toronto Police Association, said while he does not believe racial bias is a systemic problem, the union remains a strong anti-racism advocate.</p>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s conference will host speakers from various groups, such as the African Canadian Legal Clinic, South Asian Legal Clinic and both Toronto school boards.</p>
<p>Gervan Fearon, a dean of continuing education at Ryerson University and a leader in the black community, will speak at the conference. His lecture, Beyond Racial Profiling, will look at the benefits of community policing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to both applaud things that have had a positive outcome and be frank about areas where there are opportunities for improvement,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;From my own experiences and from what I&rsquo;ve seen in society and what&rsquo;s been reported in the media, I think substantial amounts of progress have been made since (the Star series). Now does that mean there&rsquo;s no racial profiling or improvements to be made? Not necessarily so.&#8221;<br>

<i>&ldquo;Our responsibility as police officers is not just safe communities. We have a role in social justice as well,&rdquo; said Blair.</i></p>
<p><br>
Wrong, Chief Blair, entirely wrong. Please stop with the &#8220;social justice&#8221; claptrap. Just get the bad people (and you know as well as I do who they are) off the streets of my city. Please. That&rsquo;s all that normal, law-abiding Torontonians want you to do. Oh, and don&rsquo;t discriminate against white male applicants while you&rsquo;re at it. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough when your school system or your city hall gets taken over by diversity loonies   &mdash;   but when your Chief of Police starts talking like a guilt-ridden social worker in a fuzzy cardigan and a &#8220;Save the Whales&#8221; button, I figure it&rsquo;s really time to worry. </p>

		<p>Lost in all this hoopla is that minorities commit very disproportionate shares of crime, especially violent, in Toronto, and many other places.  </p>
<p>I was unaware that police officers were supposed to work for &#8220;social justice.&#8221;  They&rsquo;re fools if they do that.  Cops that go into the job thinking they can &#8220;make a difference&#8221; are more likely to be murdered in the line of duty than the stereotypical &#8220;hard nails,&#8221; cops who actually enforce the law:</p>

THE END OF WHITE CANADA?</p>
<p><b>Racial demographics of Toronto (CMA): 42.9% visible minorities</b> (as of <b>2006</b>)</p>
<p>Visible minorities accounted for 42.9% or 2,174,100 of the population in Toronto (Census Metropolitan Area), according to the 2006 Census. The largest visible minority groups in Toronto were South Asian (684,100), Chinese (486,300), Black (352,200), and Filipino (172,000).</p>

		<p>As part of my reading about the white movement I like to read sociology books. These books are not written by police chiefs and I think most police officers don&rsquo;t read such books either. The blunt fact is police enforce values, they don&rsquo;t create them. So when the chief gives us his opinion about racism he is repeating what he has been taught by value creators. Policing is a tough job and the officers need a handy value set to avoid controversy and unfairness. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they have an understanding of what racism really means or what it means for other segments of society. Whether it means stopping race quotas and immigration, or developing a white identity, to the chief that might be racism but that is only within the narrow perspective of his job. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Toronto police have had a &ldquo;renaissance in diversity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the tragedy of it all is that they&rsquo;re too stupid to understand what a horrendous mistake they&rsquo;re making.  </p>

<p>You can bet among 18 year olds it&rsquo;s closer to 60 to 70 percent or more nonwhite. </p>

		<p>So, visible minorities commit a disproportionate amount of crime and white police are having to apologize, to visible minorities? There has to be a place for white folks somewhere, including those unmentionables who happen to be white victims of the true and real victims.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;<i>Officers are now going door to door in various ethnic enclaves, promoting careers in policing and educating anyone who is interested in how to get started.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Now we have minority door-to-door salesmen in police uniforms knocking on doors trying to recruit people of their own ethnicity. Essentially, they&rsquo;re trying to remake a once proud Canadian police force into one resembling <i>their</i> own image.</p>
<p>This is really a sad day in Canada when <i>racial politics</i> takes precedence over hiring the best and the brightest police recruits for Canada&rsquo;s largest city. This current police chief, in collaboration with the p.c. brigade, are committing the very act they denounce, by using race-biased techniques to hire more minorities at the expense of white Canadian males. In some circles, that would be described as &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Comments from this ex-bobbie and <a href="https://britishexpats.com/forum/showthread.php?p=7967115#post7967115" rel="nofollow">taken from this police forum</a> (Sept. 26, 2:18PM) don&rsquo;t exactly offer a ringing endorsement for the &ldquo;quality of recruits&rdquo; the TORONTO POLICE seem to be hiring.  </p>

<p>Of course the police chief is going to say racial bias exists - that&rsquo;s what they hired him to say.</p>

		<p>I remember a few comments by people in passing that used to live in Toronto when it was basically all white, it was apparently a very nice interesting place with different ethnicity&rsquo;s and a high clean safe stantard of living. When visiting in recent years they say its been ruined by the dark people. Darkness has settled on yet another land.  This ISSUE of racism&hellip; is simply the reality that healthy white people do not want to lose their genetics in darker races, therefor they prefer to live and raise their kids where the non whites don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>The Toronto Police Chief should read <i>How Racial P.C. Corrupted the LAPD</i> in the May 2005 issue of The American Enterprise where in its quest for diversity, seriously damaged that police department&rsquo;s credibility by firing over 100 officers. Los Angeles is not alone because other major U.S. cities have suffered accordingly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Toronto Police suffers the same fate in this foolish exercise of race-based hiring practices at the expense of merit-based qualifications. See this example of what happens to high standards when hiring less qualified recruits.</p>
