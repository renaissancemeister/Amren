			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>McDonald&rsquo;s 365 Black, McDonald&rsquo;s</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At McDonald&rsquo;sÂ®, we believe that African-American culture and achievement should be celebrated 365 days a year  &mdash;  not just during Black History Month. That&rsquo;s the idea behind 365Black.com. It&rsquo;s a place where you can learn more about education, employment, career advancement and entrepreneurship opportunities, and meet real people whose lives have been touched by McDonald&rsquo;s. Plus, you can also have a chance to win exciting once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. So make sure you visit often  &mdash;  you just might get inspired.</p>
<p>Like the unique African Baobab tree, which nourishes its community with its leaves and fruit, McDonald&rsquo;s has branched out to the African-American community nourishing it with valuable programs and opportunities.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been to McDonald&rsquo;s and watched the African-American community being &#8220;nourished.&#8221;  Based on the quantities consumed and the body mass of the customers, I can definitely say that McDonald&rsquo;s has been overabundantly successful in this regard.  </p>

		<p>Quite bizarre stuff, seems to be basically a massively elaborate recruitment tool to hire more burger flippers. Yeah, why just put a sign in the window saying Help wanted, when you could make a faux black power website instead?</p>
<p>I am guessing some six (or possibly seven) figure earning &#8220;diversity consultant&#8221; or &#8220;affirmative action coordinator&#8221; or whatever, had to justify his existence and continued relevance to the McDonalds organization and needed some flashy accomplishment to get his contract renewed. Or perhaps McDonalds lost one of those &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; lawsuits we read about so much these days because they hired &#8220;too many&#8221; Hispanics burger flippers in the hood and is trying to appease the NAACP.  </p>
<p>We live in very strange times.</p>

		<p>Every McDonald&rsquo;s I have been to that has been staffed by blacks is slow, inefficient and the cashiers are apathetic if not downright rude. </p>
<p>Ironically, at most of the McDonalds around my area the black employees inevitably end up being replaced by illegals over time. Even not knowing any English, the illegals always provide better service than the blacks they replace. </p>
<p>Still, McDonald&rsquo;s goes out of its way to please blacks to the point of even having ebonics speakers in its radio commercials. And now this website. All black culture and achievement can be celebrated adequately in a 48-hour period. There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of repetition trying to fill all 365 days of the year.</p>

		<p>No surprise here.  McDonald&rsquo;s customer base is heavily black and it shows in their advertising.  I personally don&rsquo;t care other than the fact there would be a double standard if it were a 365White site.  Other than that it&rsquo;s just a site to advertise for cheap labor for their franchises.  I know what black &#8220;culture&#8221; is but how about throwing some achievements up there so we can see what they are?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Calling 9-1-1 because they were out of Chicken Mc Nuggets&hellip;&#8221;<br>
In all fairness the real reason she called the police was because the clerk would not return her money after he couldn`t provide what she had ordered. Which I totally believe. I guess the clerk was  too scared to give back money over a no sale that he was probably too ignorant to void off the register to begin with. Which brings me back to a vow I keep making but not following thru on. My world has gotton soo Third World that I vow to start carrying enough bills to only give exact change for every transaction. That way I do an end run around employees who can`t even make correct change&hellip; Good idea? Anybody? </p>

<p>Perhaps McDonald&rsquo;s would like to punctuate every day of its 365-days-a-year campaign with a different black invention, scientific discovery, medical advance, economic/political theory, mathematical postulation, military achievement, manufacturing triumph, or literary triumph.</p>
<p>My guess is that they&rsquo;d bog down before the first week was out.</p>

		<p>Wow, that is one deeply cynical website.  I didn&rsquo;t see any black history up on it, I did see lots of marketing and advertising the McDonald&rsquo;s lifestyle, and it appears to be a way for McDonalds to use black verbiage to sell more mcnuggets.  What&rsquo;s more &#8220;racist&#8221;, admitting up front you&rsquo;re not down with black folks or using their words against them and feigning solidarity to sell them more mcNuggets?  Ugh.</p>

		<p>Mickey D&rsquo;s has been the source of high blood presure, obesity and diabetes in the &#8220;black community&#8221; for generations. If they wanted to celebrate the rich cultural diversity of the African experience, why not add human flesh to their menu, since cannibalism was rampant in African tribal culure before whitey put a stop to it. How about a McCannibal burger? BTW, don&rsquo;t the golden arches remind blacks of slave shackles? Along with a straight rod, the rounded arches restrained hands and ankles.</p>

		<p>I take it, African-Americans do realize just how patronizing and condescending McDonalds are being with this opportunist scheme of theirs which is nothing more than a cynical attempt at increased profit-making.</p>
<p>It comes to something when fast-food joints start propagandizing on behalf of some minority or supposed minority by masquerading as education establishments as well.</p>

		<p>The real secret to McD&rsquo;s earlier success was not the quality of food.  It was that they catered to the kids.  This was an excellent marketing strategy that separated McD&rsquo;s from the other fast food houses at the time.  They claimed about 40% of the total market.  I remember about 15 years ago, at the behest of my daughter, I took her to McDonalds.  It was staffed by blacks with a large customer base of blacks.</p>
<p>The store was filthy and smelled bad.  This exemplified a people whose heritage and culture we are supposed to celebrate.  That was the last time I or my family have ever visited a McDonalds.</p>
<p>Our world&rsquo;s on fire and blacks cannot even run a clean fast food joint. Abrasive attitudes coupled with subpar performance are their leading are their most pronounced qualities and generally all you can expect from these people (not to mention their love of violence).</p>
<p>365 days of celebration of afro-american accomplishment? Sure, it can be done.  We can spend 364 days celebrating their criminal achievements and costs to society and the one remaining day celebrating MLK and Booker T.</p>
<p>The real stupidity of it all are the idiot Whites such as McD&rsquo;s executives that spew out this type of dogma.  Those are the ones that I have major issues with.</p>

		<p>McDonald&rsquo;s food is positively awful.  Soft, mushy, fiber free, heavily processed cheap foodstuff.   Pseudofood.  Be sure and take a multivitamin after eating this stuff. Your going to need it.  Yrs blacks love the semi real zero nutrition McDonalds grub.  It doesn&rsquo;t even taste good to me.  I never eat at McDonalds or fast food for that matter.</p>

		<p>Many years ago I came to the conclusion that the only things fit to eat at McDonalds was the french fries and the chicken McNuggets. For several years lately, I have gone to my freezer and taken out a number of (non McDonalds) frozen nuggets and nuked them in my microwave. The fries I just do without. It&rsquo;s worth it not to have to put up with hostile, semi-literate black teenagers, or hispanics of any age who can barely speak English. The same with most of the other fast-food establishments around here. The added benefits are a lower weight and blood pressure. </p>

<p>Sounds good but stay out of fast food restaurants.  They&rsquo;re nothing but poison not to mention they draw blacks and aliens into our communities.  Boycott ethnic owned restaurants too.  I live in a mostly White town and we&rsquo;ve seen a Chinese and Mexican restaurant close here in the last few months.  I think our people are starting to understand the processes that destroy homogenous areas.  You patron one these places and they use the money to bring over more of their relatives to put down roots.  In the supermarket don&rsquo;t get in the line with the nonwhite cashier to do your checkout.  We had a black grocery bagger hired in our local store and not many of customers would get in his lane.  The manager thought it would be &#8220;cute&#8221; if he closed off all the other aisles and force customers to him.  People then started going to the self checkout lane.  If that gets closed off we&rsquo;ll simply shop somewhere else.       </p>

		<p>If the food doesn&rsquo;t drive White customers away, the advertising should.  Their paper bags show all kinds of odd looking people on them.  People with dreadlocks and strange features that you can&rsquo;t ascertain their race.  Scenes with orientals and White children and blacks engaging in sports they don&rsquo;t normally do.  Their TV commercials are full of low class blacks with that ebony phonics twang in their voice.  One particularly offensive one was on maybe two years ago.  Two White kids with coarse dyed jet black hair and dark eyes and a mulatto with a shaved head and blue contact lenses.  It had an oriental with choppy dyed red hair and some 50s style frame glasses.  They try so hard to make everyone look the same and play down the differences it was ridiculous.  </p>

		<p>I stopped buying McDonald&rsquo;s food years ago because it&rsquo;s just lousy food.  But I got hooked on their diet cokes.  After hearing about this 365Black, it&rsquo;s time to boycott them altogether and with pleasure.</p>
<p>Of course, when you really think about, most of the major corporations in this country have been hijacked by the diversity czars, in their hiring practices and advertising.  Cuz if they don&rsquo;t hire blacks and promote black, then the Jesse Jackson police will get their pound of flesh.  So rather than stand up, the corporations have caved.  McDonald&rsquo;s is no different.  </p>
<p>Bottom line is that we would have boycott a whole lot of companies - Target, Walmart, Sears, Coke, Pepsi, McDonalds, etc.</p>

		<p>The way to deal with mcdonalds is very simple,pack your own sandwiches and avoid such establishments like the plague,not only will you be in pocket youll be healthier, thinner and be eating a snack that actually tastes nice (providing you put something nice and wholesome on your sandwiches) also dont buy carbonated drinks either for the same reasons above and in the article,dilute soft drinks and fruit juice are cheap and a damn sight better for you.</p>

		<p>I was born and raised on the east coast. Except for the military, I&rsquo;ve lived and worked in the same large metropolitan (i.e. majority black) city for my entire 37 years. </p>
<p>I recently drove to the midwest to visit friends and stopped at a McDonald&rsquo;s in Tennessee for coffee. I was frozen in place the second I walked in the door. </p>
<p>An all white staff. Clean facility. Welcoming atmosphere. Attentive white parents supervising white children in the play area. </p>
<p>Fast, accurate service. A cashier who made change with no help from the computerized register. A manager who called me &#8220;Sir.&#8221; Friendly high school kids working behind the counter. </p>
<p>A parking lot full of pick-up trucks and family cars, not tinted out low riders with spinner rims, pounding bass and the acrid stench of marijuana. No &#8220;debris field&#8221; of cigarette butts, crack vials and malt liquor bottles. </p>
<p>Talk about shock and awe. Nothing like the angry, hostile, third world experiences I&rsquo;ve had at home. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Our world&rsquo;s on fire and blacks cannot even run a clean fast food joint.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are individual blacks who (like me) are fastidious about order &amp; cleanliness in their personal lives. It&rsquo;s depressing to see them surrounded by their own kind who don&rsquo;t share their values even remotely, &amp; know that they&rsquo;re completely unable to affect any kind of change.  That must be a special corner of hell.   </p>

		<p>Commenter 7 addresses the vital issue here: as long as a McDonald&rsquo;s is not <i>staffed</i> by blacks I&rsquo;m all right with it. Attentive workers in a clean restaurant: that&rsquo;s all that concerns me. And my experience has been that a black staff guarantees that neither of those two requirements are met.</p>

		<p>The number of comments, snobbish comments to be blunt, putting down McDonald&rsquo;s food are disturbing. Admittedly, eating more than one meal a day at McDonald&rsquo;s or even eating daily there would not be a good idea. But as someone who is on the road a good deal of the time I can attest to the quality of McDonald&rsquo;s coffee   &mdash;   excellent, and the nutritional value of their breakfast offerings. McDonalds hamburgers, provided you avoid the cheese and glop laden Big Mac, are also good nutrition. And you can always ask for the fries to be unsalted or lightly salted. As long as you get your green veggie serving somewhere else daily, Mickey D won&rsquo;t kill you. </p>

		<p>I am reminded another reason why I eat fast food very rearly. </p>
<p>Here where I live MCds use to only employ elderly whites and white and black young adults. Now, it seems the fast-food corps are personally shipping fresh immigrant into traditional black and white communities so they can work at their chain-restaurants all over the towns and cities of my state. </p>
<p>The only thing Mcd is nourishing in the black communties is illegals, and obesity. If I was a black American I would consider dumping fast-food. Really fast-food joints are a ugly sore point in all our neighbourhoods that only contribute to obesity.</p>

		<p>I remember I visited a McDonald&rsquo;s a few years ago because I was given a voucher for a free coffee. I got the coffee and thought, I might have a peice of cake too and read the paper and have a little break from work. I had half of the piece of cake (the coffee was good by the way)and thought I&rsquo;d save the other half for my missus. A half an hour later I felt dehydrated, sluggish and drained. This went on for hours and ruined my day and I threw the cake out. I wanted to know, &#8216;what do McDonald&rsquo;s do to bugger up a piece of cake!?!&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The way to deal with mcdonalds is very simple,pack your own sandwiches and avoid such establishments like the plague,not only will you be in pocket youll be healthier, thinner and be eating a snack that actually tastes nice (providing you put something nice and wholesome on your sandwiches) also dont buy carbonated drinks either for the same reasons above and in the article,dilute soft drinks and fruit juice are cheap and a damn sight better for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right! I used to work with a bunch of junk-food addicts. They used to think my intricate sandwich assemblage in the lunch-room was intriguing and hilarious. I felt like some sort of avant-garde performance artist!</p>

		<p>Personally, I think we need to beat McDonald&rsquo;s at their own game. I propose that we start our own chain of Afrocentric hamburger restaurants, and call it The Martin Luther Burger King. It will have a menu specifically catering to people &ldquo;of color&rdquo; and would force McDonald&rsquo;s to compete for those in the ghetto gastronomy set.</p>
<p>Proposed Menu items would include:</p>
<p>1.) The Big Pimp, just like the Big Mac but dunked in batter and deep fried golden brown, just like the soil of Mother Africa; </p>
<p>2.) The Super Ho, 4 juicy and extra salty beef patties sandwiched between 2 chocolate chocolate-chip cookies, to give it the savory and sweet flava that the average crack ho imparts;</p>
<p>3.) The Malcolm Xtra, prepared in the halal manner as if on a special prison dietary  menu, it is sandwiched between two extra spicy chicken patties that have come home to roost;</p>
<p>4.) The Lil&rsquo; Detroiter Happy Meal, includes a Mini-LK burger, side order of chitterling rings, and a MLKshake, all served in a box designed to look like the Motor City that can be set on fire with the included matchsticks and packet of lighter fluid. Remember, children of color are never too young to learn how to obtain their &ldquo;civil rights;&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.) The Oprah, is the burger of the rich and famous. It consists of 12lbs of equally mixed ground prime rib, filet mignon, Chateaubriand, and PÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras that is marinated in Hennessy Cognac and Cristal Champagne and shaped into a giant O that surrounds a stuffing of Maine Lobster, truffles, caviar, barbequed spare ribs, cornbread, and greens which offers a delicate balance between the extravagant and homespun that personifies our beloved talk-show queen. Substitute grilled shrimp, croissants, and arugula for the spare ribs, cornbread, and greens in the stuffing to create the Obama. Yes, it costs more than fifty cent, but with all this expensive s*** in it, you know it has to be good!</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>To be fair, there is truth in this.  I drop into McDonald&rsquo;s only once in a blue moon.  But when away from the big cities, out in the US hinterland  (as Quiet Prof pointed out), it can really be quite good    &mdash;  - tasty, fresh, and hot, and served by nice people with a pleasant attitude.  (Don&rsquo;t expect that in New York!)   After all, they were originally known for &#8220;fast service with a smile&#8221;, a concept that was a total novelty in some foreign places (like Russia, and still is in New York).  This accounts for their enormous popularity abroad.</p>
<p>As for their coffee &hellip; I&rsquo;m not a coffee expert or fan, so I wouldn&rsquo;t know,  but various people who ARE have told me that they love McD&rsquo;s coffee.  I know one wealthy woman who travels to Europe with her thermos, and insists on being  near a McDonald&rsquo;s so she can have it filled each morning  (or night) with McD&rsquo;s coffee. She could eat anywhere she likes, but she LOVES McDonald&rsquo;s coffee!   I notice that other posters here have also commented on that.  It&rsquo;s a mystery to me, but I&rsquo;ll take their word for it.</p>

		<p>McDonald&rsquo;s targets its advertising toward 13% of the population, a population that does not include Whites.  You can imagine if the situation were reversed, the black community would be calling for a nation-wide boycott, picketing and screaming from bullhorns in front of the local businesses (with full coverage from the national media).</p>
<p>I also will boycott this corporation that does not want my business and instead prefers (just like the government) to cater to blacks.</p>
<p>Enough!</p>
<p>As for the black woman who called 911 over McNuggets: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Latreasa Goodman called the police - three times - in an attempt to regain her money for the lack of McNuggets. Once the cops arrived, Goodman stated:</p>
<p>&#8216;This is an emergency. If I would have known they didn&rsquo;t have McNuggets, I wouldn&rsquo;t have given my money, and now she wants to give me a McDouble, but I don&rsquo;t want one&hellip; I called 911 because I couldn&rsquo;t get a refund, and I wanted my McNuggets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The police, nor McDonald&rsquo;s, were amused and Goodman was arrested. Resolute to the end, she said,</p>
<p>&#8216;This is an emergency, my McNuggets are an emergency.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So this is what passes for an emergency in the black community  &mdash;  all other contact with the police is considered brutality and racial profiling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Memphis&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Things got a little out of order after three hungry transvestites found their service at a Memphis McDonald&rsquo;s drive-thru unsatisfactory. The three, er, men, tried to get the manager&rsquo;s attention by tapping on the drive-thru window, and when they were ignored, decided to grab a tire iron and go inside and throw a supersize tantrum.</p>
<p>Yes, the three Memphis Transvestites were so upset over the lack of service at McDonald&rsquo;s that they assaulted the employees.</p>
<p>The manager retaliated with a pot of scalding French-fry grease. When all was said and done, one worker was sent to the hospital by ambulance, windows were smashed, and the three trannies escaped before the police arrived&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>It sounds like some people are upset with Black365. Hey guys, it&rsquo;s our fault. The white man still has the power in this country no matter how much the idea may upset the typical liberal.  If we choose we can put McD out of business. Should we ever get organized enough to pull a real boycott we could break any business. No major chain can survive on a strictly black customer base.<br>
So when someone pulls some nonsense like this just let them know you will, out of consideration for your fellow black Americans, be dining elsewhere so as to leave the seats available for their black customers to come in and join in the celebration.<br>
In Newark, New Jersey white folks gave up trying to hear movies over the sound of rude and rowdy black teens. They left so other blacks might join in the movie experience. Today there is not a single movie theater in Newark.<br>
That is what happens when white folks abandon a business. And don&rsquo;t think the corporations don&rsquo;t know it. Even the mere threat of an actual, real boycott by white customers would bring all this posturing to an end.</p>

Well he didn&rsquo;t make thirty days as his doctor told him he was on a deadly path in regard to his fat gain, huge spike in LDL, bad cholesterol, and a host of other problems. So it was shown that yes, McDs can in fact kill you, and quickly for that matter. </p>

Like the unique African Baobab tree, which nourishes its community with its leaves and fruit, McDonald&rsquo;s has branched out to the African-American community nourishing it with valuable programs and opportunities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How nice! I&rsquo;m glad they nourish &ldquo;the African-American community&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s wonderful! </p>
<p>Now I have a question for them  &mdash;  What are they doing for the white community?<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
A better question might be, what are blacks doing for themselves and the country which feeds them. Perpetually killing white teenagers and old ladies? When is payback for those of us who provide the funds for them to splurge at McDonalds?</p>

		<p>I worked at a McDonald&rsquo;s in Nashville for about two years in the mid-70&rsquo;s, last year of high school &amp; first year of college.  The one at Fessler&rsquo;s Lane, if you know the area. Pretty seedy part of town, even back then.  Now it&rsquo;s right at the edge of a black area which has expanded greatly since those days.  Well, I was born &amp; raised right around the corner from there so I was used to the area.  All the managers and most of the employees were white.  There weren&rsquo;t any &#8220;hispanics&#8221; at that time in Nashville.  Just whites &amp; blacks.  The black employees were (like other posters have said) incompetent and/or rude.  I saw a black worker who was a &#8220;college student&#8221; spit into a burger he was making.  Their lack of effort just created more work for the rest of us.  This was my first real extensive contact with blacks; eye-opening.</p>
<p>Driving some of the black female employees home at closing time occasionally (I had a beat-up car) was my first experience in &#8220;the &#8216;hood&#8221;.  Seeing kids running around in the street at 11 p.m. seemed weird to me.</p>
<p>Even back then the blacks called it &#8220;mickey d&rsquo;s&#8221;.</p>
<p>Re:  food quality:  Back then the french fries were still cut daily from fresh potatoes.  Much more tasty than now.  The burger meat was gross frozen planks, also the fish.</p>
<p>I only eat there now if it&rsquo;s the only option.  And, I inspect &amp; usually re-assemble everything.  I see mostly &#8220;hispanics&#8221; working in the local McDonald&rsquo;s where I now live, a few miles away from the place I worked back in the 70&rsquo;s.</p>
