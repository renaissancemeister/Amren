			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edmund DeMarche, CNN, September 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Brian Milligan Sr. believes his son&rsquo;s race triggered a brutal attack on the streets of Buffalo, New York.</p>
<p>Armed with a chunk of concrete, several assailants beat Brian Milligan Jr. on the back of the head on August 18, leaving a 3-inch gash. They kicked him in the face, breaking his jaw.</p>
<p>Bloodied and bruised, the 18-year-old managed to walk five blocks to his grandmother&rsquo;s house before being rushed to the hospital.</p>
<p>Milligan&rsquo;s father believes several African-Americans beat his son, who is white, because he is dating an African-American woman. Mulligan&rsquo;s father wants police to treat the beating as a hate crime. He also has criticized what he calls a deafening silence from the community, police and the national media.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this was a black guy who was beaten by a group of white guys for dating a white girl, people would be up in arms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a double standard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buffalo police believe a group of about 10 to 15 African-American men attacked Milligan late at night, police spokesman Mike DeGeorge said. Police have made no arrests and are still investigating the motive, he said.</p>
<p>Milligan Sr. says he believes the attackers are the same &#8220;neighborhood guys&#8221; who threatened his son and his African-American girlfriend because of their interracial relationship.</p>
<p>The younger Milligan and his girlfriend, Nicola Fletcher, who is also 18, had recently complained of an increase in insults and threats in east Buffalo, where Fletcher lives and where Milligan was staying with his grandmother, Fletcher said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time they walk the streets, people stop him and call him &#8216;cracker&rsquo; and ask her why she&rsquo;s not with a black guy,&#8221; Milligan Sr. said.</p>
<p>Two days before the attack, Fletcher said she was shot with paintball pellets by the same group of neighborhood aggressors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m afraid to walk the streets,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Those guys are still out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police &#8220;are making good progress in the case,&#8221; said DeGeorge, the police spokesman. Investigators are still trying to determine if it should be declared a hate crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Milligan was taken to Erie County Medical Center, he was unconscious and suffered blood on the brain and brain swelling as a result of the beating. He will see a neurosurgeon on September 10 to be evaluated, said his father.</p>
<p>He is now recovering at home and remembers nothing about the attack, which has made the police investigation even more difficult.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The story has touched a nerve with several members of Buffalo&rsquo;s African-American community, including a local pastor who leads a predominantly black church in Buffalo.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first, it didn&rsquo;t affect me the way that it would have if I heard it was a black teen attacked,&#8221; said the Rev. Darius Pridgen, who spent years fighting for civil rights for African-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;But after I saw his father on TV pleading with the community to find the assailants, I decided I had to go after the people who beat this kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pridgen said he felt that the community has turned a collective blind eye to the beating. So he gave a fire-and-brimstone sermon at the True Baptist Church on a Sunday after the attack, appealing to his congregation to help find the culprits.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&rsquo;t deserve to be beaten this way,&#8221; Pridgen recalled saying at the service. &#8220;If you believe this, put your hands together.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it was a black teen, Pridgen said, &#8220;We would have been protesting with flags and everything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no question that race was the motivation.  The question is:  When are Whites going to be fed up enough to do something about these things??</p>
<p>As a sidebar, maybe if this father (and whoever the mother is) had some racial identity, their son wouldn&rsquo;t be dating a Black girl in the first place. </p>

I do encourage people to join the discussion on the Buffalo News website. This issue isn&rsquo;t going away. Liberals, apologists, and multiCULTuralists are working overtime to blame poverty and whites for the plight of blacks.</p>

		<p>Rev Pridgen&rsquo;s good intentions notwithstanding, his congregation and the black community could care less if a white kid&rsquo;s skull was bashed in by black thugs. Blacks are for racial purity when it comes to white guys and black girls. Would that the white community likewise stood firm for racial integrity between couples.</p>

Rev. Pridgens&rsquo; condemnation came almost a week after the attack.</p>
<p>As I said, the only reason this hasn&rsquo;t gone away as have other black on white attacks is that this time white people have been angry and made some choice comments regarding the lack of black &#8216;leaders&rsquo; response.</p>
<p>Most whites see this as too little, too late and a half-hearted attempt to show white people that black &#8216;leaders&rsquo; do speak out againt black on white violence.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another local black who came to the game late:</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s more than one double standard here. I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that the assailants in this case would be ecstatic over bedding a white woman. Of course, I agree with their desire to protect their own race. Genetics being what it is, whites need to be even more concerned about protecting our own.</p>

		<p>Just for your information. It may be of interest. This was a horrible story that is getting absolutely NO coverage here in Mpls and the MSM, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Door kicked in on new years eve, white man shot dead in front of his wife who herself was being dragged around by her hair. The two ferals were AQUITTED yesterday, and today: deafening silence.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact this page wasn&rsquo;t even available via link on the main page. I had to search by victim name to hit the buried page on their web servers.</p>

		<p>As the Reverend Pridgen shows us, Blacks don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s patootie about their own teen thugs beating up on White people. And unfortunately, it seems few White people care either. There&rsquo;s absolutely no sense of racial solidarity among Whites. We&rsquo;re not allowed. What really kills me is that statement by the thugs who, &#8220;ask her why she&rsquo;s not with a black guy&#8221;. Well Einstein, maybe she wants someone who treats her like a lady, which she&rsquo;ll never get from a saggy-pants Black hoodlum! I&rsquo;ve read that most Black women will never marry because their men are complete no-accounts. Which isn&rsquo;t our problem, granted. But I can still understand why she might prefer a decent White guy over some cretinous &#8220;homie&#8221;. What I can&rsquo;t understand is why he wants <br>
her(?). </p>

		<p>As a white man, I do not find black women at all attractive. So I would absolutely not date a black woman, even if there did not exist the tremendous anti-white racism among blacks.</p>
<p>I am sure there are plenty of pretty white women in Buffalo, New York, Brian Milligan, Jr. could have asked out to date and avoided the racial violence that came upon him.</p>
<p>However, it was still wrong for these racist blacks to harass the couple and brutally assault Milligan.</p>

<p>The media basically depicts an artificially harmonious fantasy ideal of the races intermingling and then is shocked   &mdash;   and MUTE   &mdash;   when someone young who buys into that fantasy tries to live up to the color-blind ideal and is beaten half to death by <b>kids who normally carry bricks to school</b>.

		<p>Why would a White man go for a black women instead of a White women? Besides this black women seemed to have come from the ghettoes i.e. she is not one of those few blacks who come from a educated background. If you want to associate with blacks at all, keep away from the ghetto blacks. He got what he deserved.</p>

		<p>I think black males are especially hateful of white men dating or marrying black women because black women have long figured out that most black men are highly irresponsible, violent &amp; over possessive and so many black women are just basically sick of them and would much rather have a responsible &amp; caring white man.  <br>

<p>Teenagers do stupid things. My niece did the same thing when she was 18, she actually lost her virginity to some black thug that she worked with.</p>
<p>Everyone in the family tried to talk sense to her, but she simply would not listen. She believed every stupid thing the guy told her. Teenagers can be very difficult, they can lack common sense and it is not always the family&rsquo;s fault.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Thank you both. His mother is a big question mark.  I&rsquo;d like to know more about her. And why the new-found outrage from Rev. Pridgen? Did he just learn that this was a &#8220;black&#8221; teen?</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, I have some suspicion that this &#8220;white boy&#8221; is not really all that white after all.  His aunt, I note is a &#8220;Community Activist&#8221;,  and his parents obviously consented to this  unlikely relationship and allowed it to exist, if not actually encouraging it.  Also, I&rsquo;ve studied his photograph. His very black eyes  are much too opaque and his hair too wirey for anyone of Irish blood.   And did you see the photo of his girlfriend?   What sane white parent would allow their son to bring home someone like that?   I suspect he comes from a family of race-mixers, and he&rsquo;s not the first generation to be doing it.   I can&rsquo;t say for sure but I have my doubts about this family.  Hence, my sympathy is limited.</p>
<p>And also, the sudden outrage of the Black Community may be due to their realization that he is one of them after all.  They certainly weren&rsquo;t interested in this at first. Why now?</p>

<p>True enough, Sonya.  Teenagers can do stupid things. But this boy&rsquo;s family was supportive of the relationship (and still is).  They did not find it &#8220;stupid&#8221; or try to talk him out of it.  That&rsquo;s the difference.   I suspect he&rsquo;s only doing what his parents already did.<br>

		<p>Hey the brothers gave the kid a warning&hellip; Not only is he color blind he must also be deaf! But if his inability to see or hear had been innate and not willful disregard of natures sign posts he likely would not have recieved this abuse. Its the concocted willful disregard for natural order that he and his father were punished for. Being willfuly deaf dumb and blind to the obvious is not always a virtue. Just Maybe the wheel was round enough when birds of a feather flocked together? A brick to the skull instead of Manna from heaven was his reward.</p>

<p>Is it possible we met sometime in the early 1970s, Sonya? You just described my teen years! No, I never dated a black girl (there were very few blacks in my hometown, and virtually none in my area), but I stayed way too long with a white girlfriend who was bad news, just because she liked me and no one else did. All the warnings I got went in one ear and out the other. Oh well, we all learn far more from our screwups than from our successes, and this fellow just got a lifelong lesson in what black people are all about. The current odds in Vegas are 50-to-1 he&rsquo;ll avoid black girls like the plague from now on. Hopefully a friend or relative will introduce him to this site.</p>
<p>At least he&rsquo;s more race-aware now than I was at his age. My awakening didn&rsquo;t come until my early 30s. Had I still been single in my late 20s, I might well have dated a black co-worker who claimed she was immensely attracted to me. (Of course I&rsquo;ll never know if she actually meant it.)</p>

Lost your job to &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; or to someone who was not born in the USA but got a visa to come in and take your job?

		<p>This guy is lucky to be alive. Remember the white marine married to a black that was killed. Blacks love to rub racial mixing in the faces of white men but when the shoe is on the other foot they can&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>I have to say though I love it when liberals get their come uppance. He loves to say I am sure that he is not prejudice and that everyone is equal. Well guess what! Blacks are more violent, less prone to introspection and viciously jealous of anyone who can do better than they can. </p>
<p>This whole civil rights shebang is about rubbing it in Whitey&rsquo;s face that he/she has their rights. This is why this artificial harmony that the media simulates won&rsquo;t work.</p>

		<p>  &#8221; I have some suspicion that this &ldquo;white boy&rdquo; is not really all that white after all. His aunt, I note is a &ldquo;Community Activist&rdquo;, and his parents obviously consented to this unlikely relationship and allowed it to exist. Also, I&rsquo;ve studied his photograph. His very black eyes are much too opaque and his hair too wirey for anyone of Irish blood.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I am of Irish blood.  And I don&rsquo;t believe that he is &#8220;Irish&#8221;. I doubt it.  If he is, he&rsquo;s a disgrace to his people. </p>

		<p>I betcha taht if these black guys saw a lone white girl, they&rsquo;d try to rape her or say, &#8220;Once yo&rsquo; got black, yo&rsquo; never go&rsquo; back, girlfriend&#8221; and they&rsquo;ll become violent towards white men who don&rsquo;t like seeing black man/white woman relationships, yet it&rsquo;s perfectly okay for them to say that they want to keep their race pure.  Such hypocrites.</p>

		<p> &#8220;the sudden outrage of the Black Community may be due to their realization that <b>he is one of them</b> after all. They certainly weren&rsquo;t interested in this case at first.  Why now?&#8221; &hellip; [ghw]</p>
<p><br>
This could also explain the new interest the media is showing in this case.  They weren&rsquo;t very interested before!   Why else would newspapers in Norfolk be writing about racial incidents in Buffalo?  Have they also been covering the trial in Knoxville??   Why not?</p>

		<p>His father is to blame.  You tell your kid to play with a pit bull and then the pit bull bites the kid, who do you blame.  The pit bull was just being a pit bull.  What was the father being?</p>

		<p>Just so you understand what is going on, the black females have a much higher percentage that pay attention in school, and work to actually get ahead. They are the ones most likely to raise up out of the bad neighborhood and move ahead.</p>
<p>But there are many less black males that take thing seriously, and the black women who are serious in life aren&rsquo;t attracted to the thugs, and they want someone serious, and there aren&rsquo;t enough black males to cover this. So this is where the race crossover comes into play in some cases.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is the case with this story or not. But you&rsquo;ve also got all the crazy issues where white women take advantage of marriage, and the part where the law is always on the side of the woman to screw over guys. Women whine about equality, but only when it comes to the paycheck. When it comes to divorce, all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>These are some of the issues driving it. Hopefully the black women will raise good kids and help eliminate all the trash, but it will take a long time as it&rsquo;s probably only a small percentage that escape the poverty.</p>

		<p>Anyone interested in showing racial solidarity can contribute to the following bank account to help with the medical bills.  Brian Sr is a construction worker who is unemployed at the time.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that his job has been taken by an unskilled illegal alien.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the bank information:</p>
<p> A special savings account (No. 483023966528) has been set up for Brian at Bank of America under his mother&rsquo;s name: Leslie Ann Milligan.</p>
<p>I assume that New York, like most states has victims of crime compensation especially for medical bills.  But I have been a victim of black on white crime myself with thousands of dollars of medical bills and a life time disability resulting from the stabbing.</p>
<p>Although my state has victim of crime compensation, I actually got almost nothing either in payment of medical bills or lost wages.  Of course I am White, and the people who administer the victims of crime compensation are all affirmative action black hating black and hispanic women.  I assume that is why I received no compensation.</p>
<p>So, if you can, contribute something to Brian&rsquo;s medical fund. The vicious affirmative action black women who administer the New York victims of crime compensation fund will do everything they can to avoid paying Brian Milligan&rsquo;s bills.</p>
<p>With the severe injuries he suffered, Brian will probably have a lengthy recovery period and partial life long disability.  </p>

<p>Remember the story of the 84 year old very light skinned black man who was severely beaten in a convenience store parking lot in Detroit because the black predators thought he was White?</p>
<p>During the Rodney King riots there were numerous stories of light skinned blacks, especially women with their straightened hair being attacked by black mobs.  Most of the women escaped without serious injury by screaming that they were actually blacks.<br>
