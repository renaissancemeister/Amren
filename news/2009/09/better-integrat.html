<h1>Better-Integrated Moroccans Are More Criminal</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Kievit, Radio Netherlands Worldwide, September 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dutch-Moroccan teenagers who commit offences turn out to be better integrated into society than their peers who stay out of trouble with the police, research by Utrecht University has found.</p>
<p>Sociologists Gonneke Stevens, Violaine Veen and Wilma Volleberg say in a report that well-integrated Moroccan boys become frustrated because they are often not accepted in Dutch society. The report will be presented in Amsterdam on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The academics&rsquo; research has also shown that boys of Moroccan immigrant origin break the law more often than their Dutch peers, but that the offences are less serious. Dutch-Moroccan youths are more frequently involved in offences against property, but less so in serious violence and in sex crimes, the researchers say.</p>
<p><b>Frustration</b></p>
<p>The findings appear to contradict the old adage that the more people feel connected with a social group, the less they are inclined to criminal behaviour. Gonneke Stevens thinks that teenagers who focus strongly on the Netherlands culture are more affected by the prevailing negative depiction of Moroccan youths. This creates a frustration that could lead to criminal behaviour, she thinks.</p>
<p>Or could there be another explanation? Do the young Dutch-Moroccans give in to the temptations of money and possessions? This is what Sadik Harchaoui, the director of the multicultural interest organisation Forum, thinks:</p>
<p>&#8220;If the core issue is social frustration, as the researchers say, then I would rather expect these teenagers to smash in a telephone booth or to molest a passer-by. But in fact they are focusing on money, because they want to be part of society they try to increase their social status. And they they think they can do so by possessing lots of money and beautiful objects.&#8221;</p>
<p>What we have, is actually an &#8220;integration paradox&#8221;, Mr Harchaoui says: &#8220;The better your socio-cultural integration, the more likely you are to resort to thieving while you have no job.&#8221;</p>
<p>So find a job or stay at school, appears to be the best approach, given that unemployment among young Dutch-Moroccans is about to reach 30 percent. Many of them leave school prematurely.</p>
<p><b>Higher social status</b></p>
<p>The social status of the parents of the Dutch-Moroccan offenders turned out to be higher than that of non-offenders&rsquo; parents, in terms of income, employment and eductation. Conversely, the parents of Dutch offenders have a lower than average social status.</p>
<p>In the survey, 150 Dutch-Moroccan and 150 Dutch teenage boys between the ages of 12 and 18 held in precautionary detention were compared to 500 non-detainees. The researchers also had access to data supplied by the Justice Ministry, and spoke to the parents of each of the teenagers.<br>

A similar thing happens to second/third generation hispanics in America. They end up doing worse than the first generation.</p>
<p>While the first generation made a choice to come to any nation, the second generation is likely to feel like a stranger and a victim in their adopted homeland.</p>

<p>This touches on a truism: nature is inherently competitive. It&rsquo;s what drives the world.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree they want to be part of society. Underlying the  competition between races over social status is the primal conflict of deciding who will inherit the earth. </p>
<p>It only ends when one competitor expels or consumes the other.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. <br>
Absolutely!   Once again, Anon. has hit the nail squarely on the head.  This analysis gets right down to the bottom of what is really going on here. It&rsquo;s fundamentally about <b>who shall dominate and inherit this earth. </b>It&rsquo;s very un-PC to admit that, so the establishment tries to ignore this unpleasant truth since it doesn&rsquo;t fit in with PC doctrine. It&rsquo;s also very un-Christian.  &#8220;Love thy neighbor&#8221; is not a precept found within Nature. Devour they neighbor is Mother Nature&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>This basic conflict happens among humans and it happens among other species too. Animals, insects, fish &hellip;. all compete for territory and resources. Cats and dogs are competitors within the same ecological niche. They hate each other. Dogs don&rsquo;t want to be part of cat society or to become cats.  They want to eliminate cats.</p>
<p>Thus with Moslems. Can&rsquo;t the starry-eyed Dutch see this simple fact?</p>

		<p>Second generation Morrocans in The Netherlands cannot be said to be integrated if they are a major reason for the rise in crime and the racial/ethnic nature of those crimes.  But the Dutch seem to have a duplicite condition amongst themselves; Their government tells the world about how tolerant they are and how intolerant they are of intolerance, but the individual Dutch seem to be much more clannish and xenophobic than their government represents.  Perhaps the government ought to have an honest discussion with their people?  And I wonder where Queen Beatrice stands in all this?  The time for the Northern European monarchists to take a stand is nearing because their new populations will surely put an end to their quiet reigns once they have control.  They must recognize this.</p>

		<p>Whether they are integrated into Dutch society or not, the Netherlands have a very serious immigrant problem, like most of Europe these days. And these immigrants are openly hostile to them. Only recently, while on another site, I read the rantings of a female poster from the Netherlands, using the handle of Nubian beauty, or something to the effect This woman was unbelievably hostile towards whites, and mocking them that their time in Europe will soon be over, boasting about immigrants are overtaking the Netherlands, and most of Europe. When asked what she was doing in a country filled with indigenous people she loathed, she said her parents arrived on a (work-program) in the 1970&rsquo;s, saying it was whites were too lazy to do the work. But then admitted she was collecting welfare, stating this is karma for  all white people who colonized Africa. I was disgusted by her arrogance, and sense of entitlement, but even more sickened that Europeans are allowing these types of jerks to destroy their countries, and way of life. These immigrants aren&rsquo;t the least bit ashamed about rubbing their white noses in the fact that they are being taken advantage of, by people who have zero respect for them. It&rsquo;s truly repulsive.</p>
