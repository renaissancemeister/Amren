<h1><a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=2026156">No Remorse from Terrorist, Court Told</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stewart Bell, National Post (Canada), Sept. 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Toronto man who admitted yesterday he was a member of a terrorist group that planned attacks in Canada was caught on police wiretaps saying he hated non-Muslims.</p>
<p>Ali Mohamed Dirie, a Canadian born in Somalia, called white people the &#8220;No. 1 filthiest people on the face of the planet. They don&rsquo;t have Islam. They&rsquo;re the most filthiest people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that, &#8220;In Islam there is no racism, we only hate kufar [non-Muslims].&#8221;</p>
<p>The 26-year-old was one of 18 Toronto-area men charged in 2006 in connection with a plot to attack targets in Southern Ontario in order to terrorize Canadians into withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in a Brampton courtroom, Dirie acknowledged he had obtained handguns and ammunition in the United States knowing they were for the terrorist group&rsquo;s ringleader, who followed &#8220;an extremist interpretation of Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>For almost two hours, the Crown read a 28-page statement of facts before Justice Bruce Durno. When he was finished, Dirie, dressed in a grey hoodie, baggy jeans and a blue skullcap, was asked if he thought it was accurate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dirie has pleaded guilty to participating in the activities of a terrorist group. A second charge of committing an offence for a terrorist group was stayed. The Crown and defence have agreed on a seven-year sentence but disagree over how much credit he deserves for the time he has already spent behind bars.</p>
<p>Crown prosecutor Clyde Bond wants him to serve two more years while the defence wants him to be released at his sentencing next Friday.</p>
<p>Since his arrest, Dirie has shown no remorse and has behaved badly, punching a corrections officer in the face, spitting at another officer and throwing tea at another, Mr. Bond said. His lawyer, Robert Nuttall, said while Dirie was &#8220;passionately opposed to Canada&rsquo;s role in Afghanistan&#8221; he had matured and no longer believed in using violence to advance his political beliefs.</p>
<p>Mr. Nuttall said Dirie, who has a high school education, had lost his father in an attack in Somalia but that he had a supportive family in Canada that did not believe in the use of terrorism or violence.</p>
<p>Much of the agreed statement of facts read before Judge Durno consisted of intercepted telephone calls between Dirie and the alleged ringleader of the terrorist group, who cannot be named because of a publication ban.</p>
<p>Dirie was arrested at the Peace Bridge border crossing near Buffalo, N. Y., in August, 2005, while returning to Canada in a car rented by the alleged ringleader. Customs officers found bullets in Dirie&rsquo;s socks and two loaded semiautomatic handguns taped to his thighs.</p>
<p>Later, the man said to be the ringleader told undercover police agent Mubin Shaikh that two of his associates had been arrested at the border with handguns and that &#8220;they were supposed to bring back assault rifles but they deviated from the plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he was imprisoned for gun smuggling, Dirie spoke repeatedly with the alleged ringleader and talked often about buying more guns, which they referred to using code words such as &#8220;girls,&#8221; &#8220;wives&#8221; or &#8220;black chicks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After his arrest in August 2005, Dirie continued to consider himself to be a member of that group even though he was incarcerated,&#8221; Mr. Bond said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He actively took steps to make connections with persons to facilitate the acquisition of guns &hellip; . He actively took steps to arrange for the acquisition of false travel documents for himself and members of the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;He took an active role in recruiting other inmates to adopt extreme jihadi beliefs and to become members of, or involved in supporting, the terrorist group through means such as &#8216;hardcore dawas.&rsquo; &#8221; A dawa is a call to convert to Islam.</p>
<p>He also agreed that, even while he was imprisoned, he had provided &#8220;encouragement, advice and direction&#8221; to the alleged ringleader about such matters as acquiring guns and recruiting.</p>
<p>At one point, the alleged ringleader sent CDs to Dirie, who was then at the Collins Bay prison, that were labelled Qu&rsquo;ran but which actually contained footage of Osama bin Laden calling for attacks on the United States.</p>
<p>The arrests of the &#8220;Toronto 18&#8221; followed lengthy investigations by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, RCMP and other police forces into homegrown Canadian extremists inspired by al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>The group trained at a camp north of Toronto but then broke into two factions. One group began planning truck bombings in Toronto and at a military base. Dirie was linked to the leader of the other group, who had discussed storming the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Police made the arrests before any attacks occurred.</p>
<p>Dirie is the third member of the terrorist group to face sentencing so far. Saudi-born Saad Khalid has also pleaded guilty and Nishanthan Yogakrishnan, a Sri Lankan who converted to Islam, was convicted last September.</p>
<p>Eight others are awaiting trial.<br>

<p>This black terrorist calls us &#8220;filthy,&#8221; but I imagine the hygiene and sanitation standards in Somalia can only be described as filthy. That is why they leave their failed societies and move to successful ones created by &#8220;filthy&#8221; whites. He knows his people could never create such a  society so he becomes filled with hate and racism.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Whites the filthiest people on the planet&rsquo; - However this observation didn&rsquo;t prevent this Somali from deliberately, knowingly and willingly choosing to dwell in a nation comprised (for now at least) mainly of White people and built by White people.<br>
 Just think how this man chose NOT to seek to live amongst his devout muslim bretheren in Saudi Arabia for example or Pakistan, Dubai, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Morroco, Algeria, Syria, Indonesia, Yemen, Qatar, Bangladesh etc etc etc when he fled his native land that evidently could not support him, but deliberately sought out the &#8216;filthy White kuffar&rsquo; to impose himself on - just what an effort of will was involved! - And our stupid politicians let him do it and still let thousands like him to do it daily!<br>
 This is why have absolutely zero respect and advocate zero tolerance for the immigration invasion that our &#8216;wonderful&rsquo; politicians have foisted on us.<br>

		<p>I can understand how people of color can be consumed with jealousy and hate for white people. Even so, their attitude strikes me as so ungrateful for our contributions that I feel they should not be afforded the trappings of the modern world we created. Take away our creations and this world is left with nothing but huts made of stone, wood, and cow waste.</p>

<p>Why are the people who claim to hate us the most compelled to be around us?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fond of blacks so I avoid them. Blacks say they&rsquo;re not fond of me but do everything in their power to be around me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve pointed out that contradiction many times on internet discussions and the black response is, &#8216;this is a free country and I can live anywhere I want&rsquo;. They can&rsquo;t grasp what I&rsquo;m asking. &#8216;If whites are as bad as you say, why do you want to be around them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t understand the question or the implications of what it says about them.</p>

		<p>The National Post is one of the most respected papers in Canada, along with the Globe and Mail.  </p>
<p>I have seen the Parliament building in Ottawa once and it is splendid.  Absolutely beautiful.  The building itself is one of Canada&rsquo;s most precious treasures.  </p>
<p>Of course the article was filtered and modified many many times.  I wonder what he actually said.  Did he say he despises non-muslims, or did he say he despises non-whites?  There are billions of non-white non-muslims in Canada and around the world.  I am a non-white and I am not even close to being a muslim.  <br>

<p>Good question!</p>
<p>Obviously, no non-white who spends his life screaming &#8220;Racism&#8221; has a good answer to this fundamental question - why are you here, if we&rsquo;re so &#8220;racist&#8221;?</p>
<p>Of course, we all know the answer: he is here because his own people cannot produce a successful society, and he is here for the same reasons as a burglar is in somebody else&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>What would a burglar say when asked &#8220;Why are you here in my house?&#8221; He&rsquo;d have to come up with excuses. Just like the &#8216;enrichers&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Well, since they aren&rsquo;t holding back, I won&rsquo;t either! I simply can&rsquo;t stand Somalis. They flock to European and Westernized cities that they know have the greatest welfare packages, and hand-outs, yet like the proverbial dog that bites that hand that feeds them, they always have something nasty to say about the people of the host countries they feed off of. Furthermore, they are forever pushing their religious beliefs on the citizens of their newly adopted homeland, even to the point of justifying their criminal actions, due to their beliefs, such as blaming rape victims in Sweden and Norway, for being attacked because they dare to go out in public without a veil, and almost always the attackers are fellow Somalians. They are an ungrateful lot of leaches, each and every one of them.</p>

<p>A good post. And so very true. I had the misfortune of working with a black Jamaican for many years (I am a Canadian living in immigration-scarred Toronto). He was a vile racist and dumb as a rock. He was always saying bad things about Whites / Canadians because of slavery. I grew tired of telling him we had no slavery and he was an immigrant who CHOSE to come here. I once asked him in a heated conversation why he left his black country to come to a White one, particularly if whites were so &#8220;racist&#8221;. Of course he had no adequate answer. The deeper significance of my question was lost on him. Like I say he was dumb as a rock. But its true. Jamaica is a cess-pool and that&rsquo;s why they leave. Trouble is they bring Jamaice here.</p>

		<p>This just reinforces my theory that it&rsquo;s not merely that Muslims hate non-Muslims  &mdash;  more specifically, they hate WHITE non-<br>
Muslims.  but of course the media doesn&rsquo;t call them &#8220;racist&#8221;, when that is exactly what they are.</p>

<p>Such attitudes are common among black immigrants these days.The myth that needs to be shattered the most, is that blacks who immigrate to western countries, are the most polite and well educated of all immigrants. This is patently false! In fact, the vast majority of them arrive as asylum seekers, and more apt to suck off the system, rather than support it. In Europe, African and blacks from the Caribbean, are often every bit as racist and hostile towards whites, as black Americans. Now, even though all of them have willingly immigrated there, they constantly insult White Europeans, and use the race card at any given chance, forever trying to push white guilt upon them. In fact, the worst of them can often be found in Europe and Canada, and, I believe part of the reason they feel they can get away with these attitudes so often is, these countries have been so accommodating, and generous to them, with the Government serving their interests, and bending over backwards for them, enforcing PC laws, which are ever mindful of their feelings. Instead of appreciating this, they come to take it for granted, and behave like bullying spoiled children. In other words, the better they are treated, the worse they behave! </p>

		<p> Quite a few people ask why Moslems choose to live amongst those they hate.<br>
The reason that Moslems of any nationality or race choose to live in &#8216;filthy&rsquo; Western societies is that they are on a mission to dominate the world. Nothing will stop them. Their religion/ideology compels them to convert the world to Islam.  Every single devout Muslim must devote his/her life to bringing Islam to every single person alive; there are to be no exceptions, no excuses and no forgiveness for those who do not pursue worldwide conversion. We in the West are Dar al Haarb (House of War) and Dar al Islam (House of Islam)is how it will be.  For People of the Book, Jews &amp; Christians there can be a second class status, Dhimmitude, whereby taxes, indignities and certain compulsory restrictions have to be abided by.  But nevertheless, this Dhimmitude is not the desired end state; Islamification of every soul is Allah&rsquo;s fiat.<br>
 I don&rsquo;t know how many here have thought about the scenario of enforced Islamic conversion and how you all, on an individual family level, would deal with it. It is spreading throughout our schools through sly indoctrination and through our children associating with ordinary peaceable Muslims. The current generation of Western children will grow up acknowledging Islam as just as &#8216;normal&rsquo; and acceptable as Judaism or Christianity, for them conversion will not be a problem, but rather it is WE who will be the problem - being so anti-Islam! <br>
We live in perilous times. The enemy is within the gates, Radical Muslims are waiting for the 12th Immam to appear, then the Apocalypse must and will take place before Islam dominates the world.  Nothing we can say, no rational appeals Islamic radicals will stop their pursuit of world domination because they must not stop.  Just look around your own neighborhood, any signs of Islamification? a mosque, a shop, burkahs, halal groceries in your market? Check the Internet for your City&rsquo;s Islamic society and see how widespread their networks are,  Islamic doctors, clinics, lawyers, finances, loans, schools, transport, Seniors, Summer Camps, libraries, Youth, recreation, advice, learning centres, women&rsquo;s groups, child care; the lists of Islamic centres and services are extensive and all encompassing.   There is not the slightest possibility that they will choose to reverse or terminate all this progress, so we are all going to have to decide how we wish to deal with this.<br>
Sorry about the long post folks.<br>

		<p>A great story - and easy propaganda for our side.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s use it - White folks in Canada.</p>
<p>Stop trying to sell complicated economic, monetary theories to average voters.</p>
<p>Instead present essays, posters, cartoons, music videos presenting the truth that ugly, hateful, racially and culturally aliens like Ali Mohamed Dirie &#8220;hate Whites&#8221;, want to come in to Canada for the main purpose of terrorizing and murdering non Muslims Whites.</p>
<p>Folks like Ali Mohamed Dirie do not subscribe to much or really anything about liberal, tolerant White Canada. Ali Mohamed Dirie and his Somalian, Muslim buddies don&rsquo;t go for gay rights, women&rsquo;s rights, &#8220;diversity&#8221;, &#8220;tolerance&#8221;, 2nd City comedy etc.<br>
Nor are folks like Ali Mohamed Dirie going to improve the chances of Canadian Hockey teams winning a Stanley Cup again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an easy, great propaganda opportunity for our folks up North. Why make things hard, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>

We are under no obligation whatsoever to provide these primitives with homes, jobs and a beachhead from which they can spread the Satanic cult of Islam&hellip;</p>

If you are non-Muslim, yes, he hates you, just like he hates white non-Muslim Canadians like me. I just seem to be a little higher on his &#8220;To Kill&#8221; list than you are, because Whitey is (tragically) out-of-fashion on a worldwide basis at the moment. But rest assured that if Muslim nuts like him are allowed to kill off people like me he&rsquo;ll come after people like you next. (We&rsquo;ve already seen the trouble the Uighurs are causing the Han in China.) So I hope you&rsquo;re telling your fellow Asians that they should support the white people&rsquo;s cause too, because your fate is to a large extent bound up with ours. Tell them to read AmRen. </p>
<p>As for this Dirie himself, all I can say is that there was never any reason to start letting people like that into Canada in the first place. No reason at all. Somalis bring nothing to the table   &mdash;   nothing, that is, except trouble. </p>
<p>And if Canada wants to remain Canada, it had better STOP letting people like that in. </p>

They don&rsquo;t like you!   What they like are the orderly societies, the wealth, the nice neighborhoods, and the many benefits that you seem to produce (somehow),  or which mysteriously occur wherever there are people like you.  They don&rsquo;t understand it, but somehow, where there are whites there are nice things that happen.  It must be white man&rsquo;s juju.</p>
<p>In other words, they don&rsquo;t necessarily like the golden geese, but just the eggs that are laid by the golden geese.  They would happily do away with the golden geese  entirely, if only they could. </p>

<p>Dear Korean Guy:  I am sure that he despises you equally with all other non-Muslims. In fact, if he has studied the Koran and follows it obediently (and if you&rsquo;re non-Christian)  he would despise you EVEN MORE than Christians.  (Christians and Jews, being People of the Book, are allowed a little tolerance, but all others are pagans, idolaters, and atheists who are fit for only enslavement or death.)</p>

		<p>Islam. A vile cult of rapine, murder and slavery spread everywhere by booodshed and conquest. It was invented by an uneducated, middle-aged Arab paedophile in the seventh century who liked to spend his spare time hanging around alone in a cave. You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.</p>

<p>I am a Christian&hellip; I said that quite a few times on AmRen.  I have always been actively involved with the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship at my school.  I am the official photographer of Ryerson IVCF.  </p>
<p>In Korea, there are many, many Christians.  Christianity and Catholicism should combine to be bigger than all the other religions combined in Korea.</p>
<p>I know everyone will ask me this at some point&hellip;.  and yes, there is a possibility I might go back to Korea some time in the future.  Korea, or just any non-white country.  I do not have any long term plan at the moment.  And even if I do, it can change any time.  </p>
<p>on another note&hellip;.</p>
<p>There has been a murder committed by a young white male&hellip; and just as they always have done so, the mainstream media never hesitated to put a big picture of the male who committed the murder right on frontpage of their websites.  </p>

		<p>Remember&hellip; this isn&rsquo;t just a liberal thing, or a conservative thing. This disease of self-loathing of the Caucasian race has crossed both sides of the aisle, gone down different paths in Parliament and has infiltrated America&rsquo;s public schools. We were all told that Hitler was a bad guy, but what about the brutal Chinese emperors, the African tribes, the South American dictators, the slave trade involving ARABS not Whites. Arabs sold the most blacks by far. But that is not discussed because the overwhelming majority of Arabs are Muslims. FACTS </p>

		<p>  &#8220;In fact, the worst of them can often be found in Europe and Canada,&hellip; part of the reason they feel they can get away with these attitudes is that these countries have been so accommodating and generous to them, with the Government serving their interests, and bending over backwards for them, enforcing PC laws &hellip;. Instead of appreciating this, they come to take it for granted, and behave like bullying spoiled children.<br>

<p>Yes, and this is  PRECISELY BECAUSE they realize they can get away with it!   Once they become aware that whites will meekly back down and apologize and grovel   &mdash;   and that the entire system is rigged to serve their side   &mdash;    then they realize that they have the  advantage. And so they exploit it!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly  like a dog who realizes that you&rsquo;re afraid of him.  He presses his advantage. The more you grovel,  the more he growls. </p>

<p>  &#8220;Stefanie was a bright and lovely teenager of 14, the oldest child  <b>of a blended family of a total of four children,  </b>Stefanie and Ian from Patricia Hung&rsquo;s first marriage to Adolfo Rengel, the two littlest boys, Eric and Patrick, from her union with James Hung.   Their household, even now, after the murder, remains warm, affectionate and welcoming.  Stefanie had done nothing to attract the lethal attentions of either Ms. Todorovic or Mr. Bagshaw&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>In reading this grotesque story, I need not go further.   A &#8220;blended family&#8221; of  Adolfo Rengel, and Patricia Hung, James Hung, plus Ms. Todorovic!!!    It is a typical Canadian story of multiculturalism gone berserk   &mdash;     the Tower of Babel incarnate!  Sick, sick, sick!  It could have been predicted. </p>

		<p>Blacks, whether from Africa, the U.S., or Caribbean, as well as Pakistanis, etc, are dirty people. My children were never allowed to mix with them, and that holds true today, with our youngest four year old twins. </p>
<p>They all know who the Muslims are, and they know exactly what they are about, without exception.</p>
<p>We make no excuses for those people, unlike the Liberals that seem so prevailent in our White Countries. </p>
<p>Our children were all guided from the cradle as to who and what was acceptable to us, and then, should be acceptable to them. I have no fear of my children, as they were instructed from the very beginning as who our enemies are, and how to deal with them, if necessary.</p>
