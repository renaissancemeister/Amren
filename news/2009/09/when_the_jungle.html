			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty and Matthew Hickley, Daily Mail (London), Sept. 19. 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain was under pressure yesterday to take in hundreds of migrants who have been living in a shanty town in Calais known as The Jungle.</p>
<p>The UN&rsquo;s refugee chief said Britain should take a share of the migrants who are to be evicted from their shacks when French officials clear the camp, probably early next week. </p>
<p>As many as 2,000 foreigners live rough in the Calais area with about 800, mainly from Iraq and Afghanistan, camped in The Jungle.</p>
<p>The proposal by Antonio Guterres raised the prospect of a repeat of the British humiliation when France closed the Red Cross refugee camp at Sangatte seven years ago.</p>
<p>Then Britain accepted and gave four-year work permits to 1,200 migrants who had been waiting near the Channel Tunnel mouth in the hope of making a crossing and claiming asylum. </p>
<p>But three months later, it emerged that the great majority had refused work and were costing taxpayers Â£100,000 a day in benefits.</p>
<p>Many were living in hotels, including the four-star Adelphi in Liverpool. None of the Sangatte migrants is thought to have left the UK since.</p>
<p>French officials have decided to bulldoze The Jungle after months of violence and disorder on the streets of Calais involving migrant gangs and attempts to board lorries bound for Dover. </p>
<p>Mr Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, waded into the row over the camp with a demand that &#8216;everybody that is in need of protection should be granted protection&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The former Portuguese prime minister said: &#8216;There will be situations in which we would recommend the British authorities consider the possibility, within reason, of receiving, for instance, people who have large families in Britain and things of this sort.&rsquo; </p>
<p>He did not specify how many migrants he thought Britain should take. </p>
<p>Mr Guterres spoke after meeting with the man in charge of clearing The Jungle, French immigration minister Eric Besson, who has in the past advocated freedom of travel for migrants from France to Britain.</p>
<p>A statement put out by the UK Border Agency stopped short of a refusal to accept any of those from The Jungle. </p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8216;People seeking asylum should do so in the first safe country they come to. Those who are not in need of protection will be expected to return home. </p>
<p>&#8216;The decision to close illegal encampments in and around Calais is a matter for the French government and we will continue to co- operate with them on tackling illegal immigration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was anger in the UK over the suggestion that migrants from The Jungle should come here. </p>
<p>Tory immigration spokesman Damian Green said: &#8216;Britain has a duty to genuine refugees but not to anyone who happens to have made their way to Calais. </p>
<p>&#8216;We need to improve our own border security which has been too lax for too long.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Robert Whelan, of the Civitas think-tank, said: &#8216;It is very important that people of all countries feel they have control over their own borders. </p>
<p>&#8216;Decisions need to be taken by an elected government, not by a UN quango.&rsquo; <br/>

		<p>So now the poor old Brits must take orders from the UN as well as the EU.<br/>
This even though they did not vote for any member of the UN, nor do they want to be  part of the EU.</p>
<p>Wakey,wakey England you&rsquo;re being led around by your noses by the marxists.</p>

		<p>Makes no difference really. Either repatriation is brought in within a reasonable timeframe or our nations are finished as too many are already here. Slowing down immigration is not the solution, even if halting it altogether is half the answer.</p>

		<p>  If formerly Great Britain doesn&rsquo;t take in this particular bunch, they will take others. You can count on it. The BNP is the only party that would put a stop to it. </p>

		<p>  Truly unbelieveable as all I can say. The U.S. and the U.K. need to get out of the united nations. The U.S. needs to close the U.N. headquarters in New York and send all the delegates and whatever else home to their own countries. Get the U.S. out of the U.N. and the U.N. out of the U.S. The united nations has cost us untold trillions of dollars that were literally thrown away or given to some third world dictator. It has cost us untold millins of lives. The united nations needs to be dismantled. The &#8220;western nations&#8221; cannot withstand much more from this group of tyrants. </p>

		<p>The articles in the French press made it very clear that there was one, just one reason for closing the camp:</p>
<p>A sharp rise in crime in the surrounding area committed by the immigrants.  </p>
<p>Had they behaved themselves they could have stayed forever.  But they could not restrain their criminal proclivities.  The churches and charites provided them with food, shelter, clothing, medical care and a bit of spending money.  All their needs were cared for.</p>
<p>This brings up another point.  For centuries many immigrants and so called refugees were and are criminals on the run from their home countries.</p>
<p>Ben Franklin wrote extensively about the fact that England used the American colonies as a dumping ground for criminals sentenced to be transported to the colonies.  Not all those criminals were starving beggars forced to steal food.  Many were real criminals.  It was a major grievance.</p>
<p>During the 1840&rsquo;s to 1870&rsquo;s there was a  popular song in California, &#8220;What did you do in the East?  Did you kill your wife, how many others did you end their life? Did you flee because you are a thief and a beast?&#8221;  This song reflected the fact that many of the settlers, American, Europeans, Chinese and Mexican were criminals on the run.</p>
<p>When illegal alien felons are being deported after their release from prison ICE often finds that they have criminal records in their home countries.   ICE often finds that their home countries will not accept them back because of their criminal records.</p>

<p>In fact, Georgia was a penal colony.  I am surprised that you did not mention that because your posts usually reflect knowledge and thoroughness.</p>
<p>This link will take those interested in a full history of the Georgia penal colony as rendered in Volume 1 of Our Country, a history publised in the late 19th century.  Interesting is that the Carolina colonies requested it be set up as a buffer against then Spanish Florida.  There is a great deal of interesting history in the article.</p>
