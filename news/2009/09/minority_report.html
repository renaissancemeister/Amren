			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Owen Good, Kotaku, September 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fergus Mills searches for the words. It&rsquo;s clear he wants to say this carefully. The 22-year-old from Macon, Ga. is black. His Xbox Live avatar is black. Except that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Drawing it out of him, Mills says it&rsquo;s because of the avatar&rsquo;s body language. And while Mills doesn&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s really a white guy on his screen, palette-swapped to look like him, he&rsquo;s pretty clear this representation is not from his neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make him look like me, but have you noticed, when he&rsquo;s standing right there, the way he moves? It&rsquo;s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. weird,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;He puts his hand on his hip. He twirls his head. I&rsquo;ve never seen people who act like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little thing and the discussion moves on. But it is evocative of just how conscious one becomes of these differences, during a life spent playing as characters who look nothing like you.</p>
<p>And in matters ranging from avatar creation and character representation to the marketing and affordability of games, non-white gamers&rsquo; experiences speak of a video games community that is, at best, insensitive to their membership in it, sometimes to the point of obliviousness.</p>
<p>Kotaku sought out several non-white gamers, some of whom also write about their experiences, to discuss what being an African-American or Hispanic gamer means. In an American games industry dominated, marketed to and consumed mostly by white males, discussions of race and class can quickly hit a wall, blocked by insistence that the subject is inappropriate for a pursuit that should be colorblind in basis. Ideally, yes, it should. But race matters  &mdash;  it always will  &mdash;  in a different way for video games.</p>
<p><b>Recognizably You</b></p>
<p>Rafael Sanchez is 23, lives in West Covina, Calif. and has enrolled in graduate school to get a master&rsquo;s degree in computer science. He wants to go to work in game development. If he does, Rafael would be among the 2.5 percent of developers who are Hispanic, according to an International Game Developers Association survey of its membership. A similar percentage of &#8220;recognizably Hispanic&#8221; characters can be found in video games, according to a study released recently.</p>
<p>Sanchez considers this matter from a game design perspective. &#8220;Looking at the casts of fighting games, it really is the only genre where you get a diverse cast,&#8221; said Sanchez, who writes on the blog Latino Gamer. Many of them begin with a small cast, he said. &#8220;As each grows, the initial token, it&rsquo;s a black guy that&rsquo;s thrown in  &mdash;  Eddy Gordo in Tekken, or Zack in Dead or Alive. You usually see the black person first, because they make the most obvious contrast to the white characters on the roster.</p>
<p>Because a &#8220;recognizably Hispanic&#8221; man is difficult to reduce to visual cues such as black or white skin, &#8220;it&rsquo;s harder for [game developers] to think of how to include us,&#8221; Sanchez says. &#8220;And when they do, they can&rsquo;t think of any way to do so other than stereotypes of Mexican wrestlers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t say any of this bitterly. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything malicious behind it; you write what you know,&#8221; Sanchez explained. &#8220;If the game developers and writers are largely white people, I can&rsquo;t really expect them to understand my reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same IGDA survey said its development community is 83 percent white. Blacks comprise 2 percent. Asians make up 7.5 percent, but in a sector with such a strong history across the Pacific, the issue of their representation is notably different from that of black and Latino characters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You become so used to it,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;You turn on the TV, the main character is white. Play a game, the main character is white.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You don&rsquo;t think about the underlying meaning of it. It&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s going on. People really do think of it as the norm; you make a character, he&rsquo;s going to be white.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But if minority gamers represent a market opportunity, game publishers seem slow to pursue it. In fact, another aspect in which non-white gamers feel excluded is in the marketing. If games are pitched or made with their interests or lifestyles in mind, they feel it&rsquo;s usually the next sports title.</p>
<p>&#8220;I walk into a GameStop, and they probably think I&rsquo;m there to buy NBA 2K9 or Madden,&#8221; Mills said. For the record, his favorite game is Metal Gear Solid 4. He prefers action/adventure games.</p>
<p>Gary Swaby, 23, a Briton of black Caribbean ancestry, living in Luton, England, believes that marketing reinforces, more than anything else, the image of gaming as a predominantly, if not exclusively, white activity. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The Importance of Being Louis</b></p>
<p>The Koalition, a site dedicated to the interests of the urban or hip-hop gamer, as they put it, was just cited as the best tech blog by the Black Weblog Awards. Swaby and Mills are contributors. A.B. Frasier, 23, of Newark N.J. is its managing editor, and he says the site was created in part to introduce and expose African-Americans to other types of games, since the community is largely seen as sticking with sports and shooter titles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A good example? Frasier picks Louis from Left 4 Dead. Louis is a black protagonist and a playable character who participates in a way that is not conspicuously or stereotypically &#8220;black.&#8221; He wears a tie. He looks like he stumbled out of the office to start blasting at zombies. Frasier says he even saw Left 4 Dead advertisements on hiphop sites, and says the game has very strong uptake in the black community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hardwiring a minority character into a game, without stereotype, is a powerful statement, above any game that allows customizable avatars of any ethnicity. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So the upshot there: The more a white gamer  &mdash;  or a gamer of any ethnicity, frankly  &mdash;  spends time in a homogeneous environment, the cues about race and ethnicity sent by games become even more important. Especially if they&rsquo;re the only or the predominant mass medium being consumed. &#8220;Imagine a Latino kid, who lives in an all-Latino neighborhood,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;If they were only exposed to images of white people through the media, those images will probably have a bigger impact. Contrast that with a Latino who lives in a diverse neighborhood who interacts with white kids all the time. The images from the games won&rsquo;t matter as much.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Walking in Someone&rsquo;s Shoes</b></p>
<p>Asked what they&rsquo;d like to see most, all the non-white gamers I talked to have their preferences. Almodovar would love to see Hispanic characters in the Battlefield 2 series and why not? The U.S. military&rsquo;s Hispanic population has grown steadily over the past decade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Swaby wants to know &#8220;why can&rsquo;t we make a game with a black character, and market it to everybody?&#8221; Of course, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas stands as the most notable effort in this regard. The game also is five years old.</p>
<p>But what they don&rsquo;t want more of is pretending that race somehow is not an issue, when it is one in every other mass medium in this multicultural society. The consumption of white-dominated mass media by a diverse consumer base is a legitimate, serious topic.</p>
<p>And if games belong to that equation when the discussion is about their artistic value, or their economic impact or cultural relevance, then they also belong in the discussion of the consumption of white-dominated, high-demand mass media by a broadly diverse consumer base. Holding up one&rsquo;s hand to declare it&rsquo;s not an issue will not make it go away.</p>

		<p>Yeahbut, Grand Theft Auto is also criticized by the usual cabal of civil rights whiners that they&rsquo;re engaging in stereotypes.  So it&rsquo;s another rock-and-hard-place situation   &mdash;   Either you have minorities in, and they complain, or you don&rsquo;t, and they complain.</p>
<p>Besides all that, if blacks and Hispanics want to waste their lives away playing video games, more power to them.</p>
<p>One should note that the video game industry, both in hardware and software, has fallen in a little bit of a slump lately, mainly because of the recession.  Video game ROMs are somewhat easy to pirate online, and the current generation of hardware (Wii, Xbox 360, PS3) has a hardware bill of goods that read like an expensive PC, and in spite of the fact that Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony lose money on each console sold, as in a loss leader, the prices are still way too expensive for the market to bear, save the Wii.</p>

		<p>Ive been a gamer for a long while, in my young life of 20 years. Ive noticed the trend, gaming too is infected by loony lefts multiculturalism. </p>
<p>Eventually, it will become engulfed.</p>
<p>Just like movies.</p>
<p>Just like TV.</p>
<p>just like every other entertainment medium that has fallen.</p>
<p>Ample timing though, the collapse is near, so it hardly matters what they do anymore.</p>

		<p>White designers of video games have their own culture that influences their games, they can no more think in a different culture than they can in a different sex. There is one very easy solution, apart from blaming whitey. Let some black designers produce their own, it will certainly be influenced by their own culture.</p>

When it comes to blacks, it&rsquo;s damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They complain about the lack of identifiable black characters. But to make identifiable black characters, you have to use stereotypes. </p>
<p>Put in a black character using black Ebonics with black clothing and black mannerisms and the next thing you hear is someone screaming &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When it comes to blacks, YOU CAN&rsquo;T WIN! It&rsquo;s POINTLESS to deal with these people.<br>

		<p><i>Drawing it out of him, Mills says it&rsquo;s because of the avatar&rsquo;s body language.</i></p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s saying the character doesn&rsquo;t have that certain cocky swagger that most blacks have?</p>

<p>Oh, so he&rsquo;s saying the way whites move is &#8220;weird.&#8221; And do you notice the implication that the way white guys move is somehow&hellip;effiminate? &#8220;hand on his hip. He twirls his head&#8221;? If whites were half as sensitive as blacks, there would be a firestorm of protest to this article.</p>
<p><i>a pursuit that should be colorblind in basis. Ideally, yes, it should. But race matters &mdash; it always will</i></p>
<p>&hellip;And yet this fool writer does not see that by this same reasoning race should always matter to whites as well.</p>
<p>So if blacks and hispanics do not like white video games, where are all the black and hispanic-produced games? That is what is called the free market. And don&rsquo;t tell me blacks and hispanics have &#8220;never had the chance&#8221; to learn how to program. They have had access to the personal computer for just as long as whites have.</p>

		<p>Another example of whining about an issue and expecting someone else to remedy it.  Cannot these people do anything for themselves such as programming their own video games???  Many video games were/are created by individuals, not corporations.  The field is open for anyone who wants to enter it.</p>
<p>So please put up, or shut up about this &#8220;problem&#8221;.</p>

<p>As the mother of a 16-year old boy, I am well aware of the cost of these gaming systems and each separate (and latest) game that must be purchased for it.</p>
<p>From looking at the newest systems, the graphics involved and complicated situations in the games themselves, I&rsquo;m sure an extremely high level of intelligence is required to produce these things  &mdash;  hence the low level of NAM involvement in this industry. </p>
<p>And from perusing the latest NAM NAEP math scores there is little to no hope of this ever becoming an industry with a significant number of NAMs.</p>
<p>And lest you think only rich White kids can afford these gaming systems, it is simply not true. I work in a school that where 95+% of the students receive free lunches, live in government housing, get waivered fees for such things as college applications, SAT/PSAT/AP tests, and are the beneficiaries of numerous other taxpayer-funded perks  &mdash;  yet it seems ALL of them have either a Wi or XBox system  &mdash;  the latest editions and the newest games.</p>
<p>I also see them with the latest fancy iPhones or other companies&rsquo; versions of it, the newest, best cameras, iTouches, the latest iPods  &mdash;  and any other White-created hand-held electronic device you can think of.  They regularly brag that their texting bills are over $400.</p>
<p>Every day I look out over a housing project with a multitude of satellite dishes and late-model cars in the parking lot (seems no one ever checks on these things) and watch kids walk to school in the latest $200+ shoes.</p>
<p>The answer to the dearth of diversity characters that NAMs are screaming for has a simple solution  &mdash;  start up your own company, one that prominently features non-White characters using non-White languages such as Ebonics or Spanglish, realistic portrayals of wretched NAM neighborhoods and NAM situations  &mdash;  cops included! That would be &#8216;keepin it real&rsquo; and old Whitey would not have to be a part of it.</p>
<p>But since most NAMs do not have the IQ, drive or focus to operate a competitive industry that mandates a high level of IQ, drive and focus, it will never happen.</p>
<p>Far easier to scream racism and demand that Whites diversify their own creations to include those who contribute nothing. Look for them to use their race-based  groups to pressure the government to force the manufacturers to diversity their workforce and their products.</p>

		<p>I realized that minorities wanting so-and-so representation always boils down to jealousy. They don&rsquo;t want representation, they want to be White. That&rsquo;s why you have so many so called outspoken &#8220;activists&#8221; that wouldn&rsquo;t think twice about betraying their race to marry a White woman. Think about Van Jones. You WNs have your work cut out for you. Expect a lot of casualties to this war of miscegenation. </p>

		<p>I do not know from videogames unless we change the game to Blackman instead of Pacman! But I do know about stereotypes, or rather, reverse stereotypes: So, in  a TV commercial where a married couple has children, will be blacks with wedding rings. (Very stereotypical!); If the ad or show has a stupid doofus doing something stupid and doofusy, then the wise person looking on will be a wise Latina or wise black. On and on. Now, if the ads or shows,(outside of Cops!) ever showed blacks the way they usually are (and I except a lot of blacks I know and see who are probably smarter and sharper than I am!), then, we would have complaints for that. You cannot win for losing, and I just ignore people like the writer of this article. </p>

<p>I know a couple guys who don&rsquo;t actually design video games. </p>
<p>They refine and test the games.  It takes about 8 months from the time the finished games are sent to the testers to refine the game to the point where it can be manufactured and sold.</p>
<p>So they are very complicated and technologically advanced. The testers I know all have computer science bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, something few hispanics and blacks have in spite of affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea.  Get Blacks to develop their own games,(or get someone to do it for them),then provide each of them with a console. In every Black neighbourhood, their would be a free computer game library. Or, if they can figure it out, they can download free games from the net. I reckon that that is a better way to spend taxpayers money.  Think about it.  With access to all the latest games and a console in every home, theyd never leave.  Whole families would spend their entire lives playing computer games, leaving only to collect their welfare benefits.  The crime rate would plummet, and the money saved on fighting crime would far outweigh the cost of the scheme. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that, but I do know that Tom Clancy&rsquo;s novel &#8220;Sum of All Fears&#8221; was about Palestinian terrorists vis-a-vis I&rsquo;rael.  In the movie version, they made white neo-Nazis as the evil protagonists.</p>

And it appears that someone in Hollywood or another bastion of popular culture has finally figured out how to count. Since WWII ended 64 years ago,any participant would be geriatric by now. Even given the state of out education system today,most any dunce can figure out that 80 year olds-even ones that are in excellent health-can hardly be plausibly expected to engage in feats of derring do in a dastardly cause. (exceptions possibly made for those with turbocharged wheelchairs)</p>
<p>The New Improved Generic Villain seem to be the Evil White South African Expat. I first noticed this phenomenon in the remake of &#8220;The Manchurian Candidate&#8221;,wherein an evil genius South African (white,of course) brain surgeon was drilling holes in heads and inserting evil thoughts.</p>
<p>And since then,I&rsquo;ve seen a few other Evil White South African villains in fiction thrillers and maybe another film. Can&rsquo;t recall the details since they don&rsquo;t really interest me too much,but I think we can all look forward to more devilishly clever South African villains.</p>
<p>(Probably played by idiot actors that wouldn&rsquo;t dare set foot inside the hellhole the South Africa has become after the power handover,come to think.)</p>

		<p>Perhaps these whiners should play Neverwinter Nights, a game in which one can customize the appearance of one&rsquo;s character; skin and hair color, hairstyle and body build can all be tailored to suit a player&rsquo;s whims when that character is first created.</p>
<p>Playing online, however, I have noticed that the characters are overwhelmingly white, except for one of my friends, who plays as a drow (a race of evil, subterranean elves who have dark gray skin and white hair.)</p>
<p>What the whiners who raised this issue appear to be willfully ignoring is the fact that the vast majority of computer gamers are white, and the producers of games are simply tailoring their products to the market.  My own suspicion is that these are people who simply don&rsquo;t have enough to complain about, and who feel unfulfilled unless they are in a perpetual state of moral outrage.</p>
