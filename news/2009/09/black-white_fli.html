			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sally Goldenberg, New York Post, September 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Public-advocate candidate Bill de Blasio has outraged black politicians and many of his own constituents by sending targeted mailings to African-American neighborhoods featuring pictures of his interracial family, sources told The Post.</p>
<p>Most of the ads mailed to predominantly white areas had no pictures or just showed photos of the candidate, the sources said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The insulting part of it is that if you want to appeal to the black community, then appeal to us based upon our issues, not based upon who you&rsquo;re married to,&#8221; said City Councilman Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn).</p>
<p>De Blasio, whose campaign denied ethnic targeting, is a councilman who represents central Brooklyn. He&rsquo;s white and his wife, Chirlane, is black.</p>
<p>Up to six of his mailers showcased Chirlane. At least one featured photos of their two children, a 14-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another has a message from his wife simply saying, &#8220;He gets it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the one I&rsquo;ve heard so many black women complain about,&#8221; said one source.</p>
<p>&#8220;The implication is he&rsquo;s married to a black woman so he &#8216;gets us.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, sources told The Post that many politicians, including some who have supported de Blasio&rsquo;s bid in the four-way Democratic primary to succeed Betsy Gotbaum, were highly offended by the mailer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A resident of de Blasio&rsquo;s district who got the family pictures, said, &#8220;Bill is well liked in the black community, but has now gone too far and with too much.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Whatever whites do, blacks will complain.</p>
<p>If this guy had not featured his family in his ads blacks would claim he was ashamed of them and was hiding them from the voters.</p>
<p>Since he did include his family the blacks whine that he&rsquo;s exploiting them.</p>

You think he would target &#8220;forward thinking&#8221; Whites with the pictures most of all,instead of not at all! Then I looked at the picture. His wife sure is Black&hellip; maybe that ignites some kind of prejudices in both Blacks and Whites that mere &#8220;post racial&#8221; simpletons of both colors have trouble dealing with. Which leads me to believe that this whoole color line thing is moving fast and far beyond what a lot of people like myself know how to deal with and how to respond to&hellip;</p>

Hmmm. I wonder if there&rsquo;s more to the story.  Usually, blacks would be tickled pink (well, black) by something like this.  Could there be a black candidate who&rsquo;s running and these &#8216;black leaders&rsquo; are supporting the black man?</p>

		<p>Come on, this is funny!  Sometimes you have to stop and laugh!  He is trying soooo hard.  &#8220;Look&#8221;, he&rsquo;s saying.  I know their secret handshakes, I speak their language.  I know their catch phrases and I buy their rap records off their blankets on 34th street.  I love &#8216;em so much I&rsquo;ll even marry them.  And I have so much love I have to tell the world!  I love them more than they love themselves!  So vote for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>-To #3 Anonymous - Black men are not tickled pink when a White man appropriates one of &#8220;their&#8221; women.  Also White women are not pleased to see a White man like this with a Black woman; and she doesn&rsquo;t even appear to be a mulatto.  She&rsquo;s very Black.</p>

What aura of blackness ? some mystery ? It is a black thing&hellip; we do not understand. Perhaps it is the vaunted Black Soul, That they have some great common culture due to slavery ?<br>

		<p>I think I know why blacks are upset about the whole thing.  It was a very poor choice of words.  A message from his wife saying &#8220;he gets it&#8221; sounds like an in your face sexual innuendo.  If this were distributed in my White neighborhood I would be disgusted by it and given her looks, I would wonder how he keeps it up.</p>

Thanks for that link.</p>
<p><i>Barron received  a certain amount of notoriety  for a remark he made during a 2002 reparations rally:   <b><i>&#8220;I want to go up to the closest white person and say, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t understand this, it&rsquo;s a black thing&rsquo;&hellip; and then slap him, just for my mental health.&#8221; </i></b></i></p>
<p><i>He has also shown support for Venezuela&rsquo;s Hugo Chávez, in an interview with Tucker Carlson, calling him a &#8220;Humanitarian&#8221;. </i></p>
<p>Barron was host to Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, who came to the United States and spoke on the steps of City Hall.  Mugabe&rsquo;s action of removing white farmers from Zimbabwe&rsquo;s farms was blamed by the United Nations for lowering corn production by 70%. Mugabe is often considered a dictator by much of the West, but was praised at the event with cheers by the black audience. <br>
  <br>
Barron was arrested with Preston Wilcox from the Institute of African Research because they, with roughly 12 to 20 protesters, attempted to &#8220;forcibly remove&#8221; a white employee from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.  They intended to remove Robert Morris, a white historian, who was appointed chief archivist for the Center. They were charged with harassment and criminal trespassing.</p>
<p>He has often spoken against police brutality, saying that crime is not the fault of the black community.  <br>
Barron has taken on an array of issues, such as voting for non-citizens, and has welcomed illegal immigration with the phrase, &#8220;don&rsquo;t criminalize, legalize.&#8221; <br>
He appeared on the TV program The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor  and said the entire &#8220;immigration problem&#8221; is really a black-white issue. He argued that Germans, Jews, Poles, Greeks, and Italians who immigrated to the United States during the late 1800s were welcomed because of the color of their skin, but now, &#8220;All of a sudden when the complexion of immigration changes, now it&rsquo;s &#8216;these people&rsquo;.&#8221; <br>
  <br>
The &#8220;Browning of America&#8221;: <br>
Barron feels his issues and his <b>consistency </b>[sic &hellip; I&rsquo;m sure he meant &#8216;constituency&rsquo;]    will win in the future because of changing demographics.  When asked about a mayoral run in 2002, he said he believed that it would be very possible because New York City&rsquo;s population would be predominantly black and Latino.  He maintains that the &#8220;browning of America&#8221; will change the United States drastically and will be a threat to white Americans, who will have fewer socio-economic advantages to keep themselves as the dominant force of American society.<br>
  <br>
View of U.S. history:<br>
Barron has frequently raised eyebrows by trying to change the presentation of history in the United States. He is very vocal about publicizing black history, including erecting portraits of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, as important leaders of American history.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>These race-obsessed fanatics are the thuggish &#8220;represenatatives&#8221; that blacks, when given the chance,  adulate and elect to office.  This is the black version of  &#8220;democracy&#8221;!</p>
<p>However, I loved this:  <br>
<i>Barron has long criticized the statue of Thomas Jefferson in the City Council chamber,  which he claims represents a &#8220;white, slave-owning pedophile.&#8221;   However, when he criticized the new speaker for the Council, Christine Quinn, his seat was changed to one next to the statue, which was seen as a punishment.</i></p>

<p>Barry married an &#8220;angry&#8221; black woman, even more important to black people - if you&rsquo;re not a mad, entitled, activist, anti-White/American then you are not black. Infantile logic&hellip;</p>

		<p>12 Anon and Westerner:</p>
<p>I am of the belief that part of the reason why the person of Barack H. Obama, Jr. married the former Michelle Robinson, outside of true love and affection, is that he needed lay down some roots in Chicago to grease the skids for his political career.  It took him a long time and a lot of dues-paying to show the &#8220;brothers&#8221; that he was &#8220;keepin&rsquo; it real.&#8221;  After all, it was only a few years before he met Michelle R. that white conservative Harvard Law School students backed Obama as a consensus candidate to be the Editor of the Harvard Law Review.  That had to be an embarrassment to Obama that he wanted to live down, as he was planning to unseat Booby Rush in Congress.</p>

		<p>For some reason, I&rsquo;m remembering an old comedy LP that I once owned by the comedian Redd Foxx, who was pretty funny.   He had two very great lines on that album that I laughed really hard over, and they went something like this:</p>
<p>Redd Foxx:  If you ever see me with a white women, you can bet that I&rsquo;m holding her for the police.</p>
<p>Redd Foxx:  When I turn back the sheets, I want to see a black lady staring back at me, not a white chick who you can&rsquo;t see in dark against those white sheets!</p>
<p>Black comedians like Foxx and Cosby - seemed to grasp the offensive nature of making jokes about race mixing, and toed the line that they knew would win the respect of white audiences.  </p>
<p>You know what?  I really miss that kind of cross-racial respect, and when it ended, I think that set this country on a course for a certain collapse.    </p>
<p>After all, making jokes about genocide aren&rsquo;t really all that funny.</p>

<p><br>
Not to disagree with Luke, but let me point out that Redd Foxx, with his reddish hair and complexion, for which he was known, was himself (despite all his protestations to the contrary) a flamboyant result of race-mixing. He didn&rsquo;t get that red hair from Africa.</p>
<p>As often seems the case, many of the nearest-to-white are the ones who bash whites the most. (Rev. Wright, Malcolm X, etc.)</p>

I have a hard time taking the part of a White man so deracinated that he murders his ancestors by polluting his genetic heritage. He&rsquo;s not a victim, he&rsquo;s a criminal. His children aren&rsquo;t European, so he&rsquo;s creating more Africans. That can&rsquo;t be a good thing for our Civilization.</p>

<p>Thank you, thank you, and thank you!  It is time for the white men on here to stop finger pointing at their own women when it comes to race mixing.  White men are already more guilty of this when it comes to mixing with Asians and hispanics.  And now I am hearing about more and more exponentially increasing cases of white men with black women.<br>
