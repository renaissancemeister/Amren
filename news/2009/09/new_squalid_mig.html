<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Squalid camps next to the derelict Hoverport in Calais are in danger of mushrooming into a new &#8216;Jungle&rsquo; full of Britain-bound illegal migrants, it was claimed today.</p>
<p>Just 24 hours after a mile-square stretch of wasteland was cleared of hundreds of mainly Afghan young men, the town&rsquo;s mayor said she had &#8216;spotted between fifteen and twenty squats&rsquo; nearby.</p>
<p>Natacha Bouchart added that many were &#8216;close to the Hoverport&rsquo;  &mdash;  a disused collection of buildings which closed in 2005 after the last hovercraft sailed from Dover to Calais.  </p>
<p>While supporting the destruction of &#8216;The Jungle&rsquo;, Mrs Bouchart conceded that it was just a &#8216;matter of time&rsquo; before another major squat was set up by the Afghans, and that the area around the Hoverport was an obvious location.   </p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;ve warned the regional authorities about this,&rsquo; said Mrs Bouchart. &#8216;The buildings are dangerous to migrants, with just one match all it would take to start a fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The squalid conditions were almost identical to those in the so-called &#8216;Jungle&rsquo;, less than half-a-mile inland, which was razed at dawn on Tuesday by some 500 riot police.</p>
<p>French Immigration Minister Eric Besson had viewed the closure of the camp as being a crucial step in his plan to make Calais &#8216;watertight&rsquo; against people smugglers and migrants.</p>
<p>But although there were 278 arrests, including 132 claiming to be minors under 16, many were back on the streets within 24 hours, ready to resume their attempts to get to Britain, where they will claim asylum or disappear into the black economy.</p>
<p>At the end of August frontier police arrested 11 Afghan migrants including a child of 14 in a camp by the Hoverport.</p>
<p>The disused terminal and offices, which date back to the late 1960s, are alongside a stretch of motorway slip road where England-bound lorries regularly slow down.</p>
<p>All those arrested had been trying to break into the back of the HGVs in between living and sleeping in a camp surrounded by rubbish, with no toilet or cooking facilities.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Hoverport is a place which has proved particularly popular with Afghan migrants,&rsquo; said a Calais police spokesman.  </p>
<p>&#8216;We raided it on August 27, dismantling a camp and making a number of arrests. There have been further attempts to re-establish a camp at the Hoverport  &mdash;  something which has continued since the dismantling of the Jungle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of the 11 Afghans arrested at the Hoverport last month, none agreed to claim asylum in France, and also said no to voluntary repatriation back to their homeland. Instead they all made it clear that they wanted to start new lives in Britain.</p>
<p>Accordingly, like the majority of former Jungle residents, all were freed within 24 hour hours  &mdash;  the legal limit within which frontier police could hold them  &mdash;  leaving them free to try to get to the UK again.</p>
<p>Faced with such statistics, opponents of Mr Besson&rsquo;s decision to destroy The Jungle accused him of an expensive publicity stunt which simply displaced the migrants, rather than getting rid of them.  </p>
<p>Martine Aubry, leader of France&rsquo;s opposition Socialist Party and the Mayor of Lille, described the razing of the camp as a &#8216;totally inhuman act which doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said that the migrants &#8216;will go elsewhere, they&rsquo;ll set up a little home in a place which is even more dangerous where they&rsquo;ll try to survive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It came as the local authorities in Calais also pinpointed wartime blockhouses which once formed part of Nazi Germany&rsquo;s Atlantic Wall against an Allied invasion as becoming particularly popular with migrants.</p>
<p>&#8216;Doorways have been forced open, with the migrants turning them into secret homes,&rsquo; said a Calais Council spokesman. <br>

<p>Aw, isn&rsquo;t it a shame the dangerous, filthy conditions under which they&rsquo;re &#8220;forced&#8221; to live?  How inhumane of us!  Shame on white Europeans for being so cruel!</p>
<p>This goody-goody babble illustrates extremely well the sick mindset that we have got to get over.  Everything is always about what&rsquo;s good for the &#8220;refugees&#8221;  &mdash;    what&rsquo;s good for the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; (so called). There&rsquo;s not a word here about our wellbeing.  When are we going to smarten up and start warrying about <b><i>what&rsquo;s good for us  </i></b>for a change?  When it&rsquo;s too late?  </p>
<p>Our governments and our churches are so busy being social workers and playing santa clauses to the world that they worry about EVERYBODY ELSE, and not about us   &mdash;   the people they&rsquo;re supposed to be representing!</p>

		<p>ghw&hellip;.good comment!  When did White governments start caring about nonwhites over their own peoples? I am so sick and tired of all these sob stories about refugees and &#8220;immigrants&#8221;. What happens when we become the refugees and immigrants fleeing from our own nations? Think these nonwhites will take us in and provide for our well being with sob stories such as the one above?</p>

The only solution to this problem is force.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe any western nation has the guts, will, or fortitude to do what really needs to be done.</p>
<p>Being nice, courteous, and respectful of &#8216;human rights&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t going to solve this problem.</p>

Taxpayers are paying £73million to house and feed failed asylum seekers who should have been deported - a huge leap from the £4million spent just four years ago. Ministers have admitted the increase is due to the huge backlog of failed claimants, who cannot be removed despite judges ruling they have no right to stay here. Immigration Minister Phil Woolas has now blamed lawyers for the rise, saying they were &#8216;frustrating&rsquo; the Government&rsquo;s efforts to deport failed asylum seekers. He said many were &#8216;paralysing&rsquo; the asylum process by arguing that their clients cannot be returned to their homelands because of conflict or because they are unwell. But the Refugee Council, which provides advice to asylum seekers, has hit back, saying the Home Office was running a system that is &#8216;under-resourced&rsquo; and plagued with &#8216;administrative problems&rsquo;. The shocking Government figures were revealed by Mr Woolas in a parliamentary answer to Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Teather. They show that, in the financial year 2007/08, about 9,365 failed asylum seekers received £73million in accommodation and food allowances - about £8,000 a year or £150 a week for each claimant. A spokesman for the Home Office admitted that the number of failed asylum seekers claiming assistance had more than doubled from 5,180 in 2004/05 to 10,850 by the first quarter of this year. But he insisted the rise was due to failed claimants becoming more aware they are entitled to receive benefits under Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. It states that those who can prove they are destitute can claim free accommodation and £35 a week in food vouchers. Although the support is meant to be temporary, in reality most who qualify will continue to receive it as their lawyers engage in protracted legal battles against their removal. Mr Woolas said: &#8216;A large proportion of those on Section 4 support have exhausted all rights of appeal and should return home, but their lawyers are continuing to frustrate and delay removals, playing the system and offering false hope.&rsquo; However, a spokesman for the Refugee Council said: &#8216;The Home Office asylum process is extremely under-resourced and it has real administrative problems that have caused the backlog of removals.&rsquo; Damian Green, Tory immigration spokesman, said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s simply not good enough for Ministers to blame lawyers for the shambles in the whole system. The Government needs very urgently to do something about the rising cost.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Not only are these third world denizes flooding into our White, European homelands and living high of the hog demanding housing, schooling, medical care, legal representation, food, clothing, and every one of their whims catered to at the expense of the Native Born White European tax dollars, but has it ever crossed anybody&rsquo;s mind that we, The United States, have over 20,000 troups over in Afaghanistan and calling for 45,000 more of our brave soldiers to go over there and loose life and limb fighting a war that they, the Afghani people will be the benefactors of our  humantiarianism, of our altruism, etc. Our troups are over there volunteering thier lives, risking fatherhood to their children, enduring seperation from their families, to fight Taliban so Afghanis could have freedom in thier lives, to liberate their country from  tyranny only, to bring law., order and democracy to their country just so they can go sponge of the U.K.&rsquo;s public teat. It&rsquo;s absolutely sickening. They should be forced back into their own country. Period.</p>

<p>The reason is simple and awful; The government wants more numbers for taxing purposes to keep the government afloat and don&rsquo;t trust the low birthrates of whites to keep the coffers full, and the church wants more members that they think they will eventually gain, as well as a purpose, lest they be seen as useless and obsolete.  The huge self-deception in this is that their conceit tells them that all these Muslims and non-whites will embrace white, European culture, language and even relgious practices.  Everything they should notice would tell them that they are wrong, critically wrong, but they won&rsquo;t see the plain truth staring at them.  That is because they have no acceptable solution as they have not given in to the idea that non-Europeans must be deported in order to save their own nations.  </p>
<p>I suspect that many of us are waiting to see if and when these European leaders will come to this conclusion and begin to act.  So far, they seem to be keeping their heads in the sand while an immigrant is picking their pockets and sexually molesting them above ground.<br>

		<p>The other day I watched footage of the forced evacuation of the &#8216;jungle&rsquo; by French police, on BBC TV News.<br>
Without exception all of the &#8216;migrants&rsquo; were men, young, fit, strong men - there was no one there of early middle age or later or any females.Without exception all were well-dressed, well-groomed and had the bloom of rude health - so much for the &#8216;squalid conditions&rsquo;Of course they are of prime-fighting age and yet they choose to run away from their land rather than fight.One of the &#8216;wretched and destitute&rsquo; angrily denounced the fact that it cost him $20,000 to get so far.<br>
 On the same TV News bulletin another story highlighted the plight of injured British soldiers reurned home from Afghanistan.The case featured showed a young paratrooper who had all of his arms and legs blown off.</p>
