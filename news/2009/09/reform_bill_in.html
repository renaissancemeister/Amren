<h1>Reform Bill in the Coming Weeks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Irish Echo (New York), Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Congressman Luis Gutierrez is to introduce an immigration reform bill in the House of Representatives sometime in the next few weeks. </p>
<p>The announcement was immediately welcomed by Sheila Gleeson, executive director of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers. </p>
<p>&#8220;The estimated 50,000 Irish immigrants, who followed in the footsteps of their families, friends and neighbors across the Atlantic, have been living in the shadows for too long&#8221; said Boston-based Gleeson. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is time to fix our immigration system to allow contributing, taxpaying immigrants an opportunity to contribute fully to the country that they have come to call home,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>&#8220;We encourage all of our representatives to step up to the plate in support of immigrants who contribute so much to our communities and our economy. We expect our elected representatives to engage in a vigorous, but civil, discourse and to work to develop a caring and compassionate solution to the crisis of 12 million immigrants living outside of the mainstream of our society, the statement added. </p>
<p>&#8220;The acrimony of the healthcare debate and scapegoating of immigrants has underscored the need for a comprehensive immigration solution. There is little disagreement that our system is broken, there is wide acknowledgement that deporting millions of immigrants is neither practical nor cost effective; we need a smart, just and sensible solution from our political leaders,&#8221; the statement concluded. </p>

		<p>Sorry, but the 50,000 Irish illegals have got to go, too!  If, accepting 50,000 Irish means accepting 12,000,000 blacks and browns, I want them all out by sunrise.</p>
<p>This Irish-American believes the only solution to what ails us is overturning the Immigration Reform Act of 1965.  Immediately!<br>

		<p>Much as I love the Irish, the illegal ones among them have to go.  If you let them stay, that means all kinds of less desirable illegals get to come and stay as well.  The law&rsquo;s the law.  </p>

		<p>As an Irish person from County Armagh who emigrated here LEGALLY in 2000, I say - deport them all!</p>
<p>I could have sneaked into America years ago but instead my brother and I applied from green cards and waited six years to be accepted and then had to go through a ton of red tape before finally moving to the states and pledgeing our allegiance to the flag in the summer of 2000.</p>
<p>My brother is a Doctor in Missouri and I&rsquo;m currently training to be a Police officer in Boston.</p>
<p>These illegals are cue jumpers and criminals who give us decent legal Irish immigrants a bad name. Send all 50,000 of them back and let them reapply again legally like what we did.</p>

<p>Uh, no. The thing that is broken is the law by illegal aliens. <br>
Deporting them is very practical.<br>
You don&rsquo;t let any more in and when caught put &#8216;em on a plane.<br>
Attrition would take care of it.</p>

		<p>  I am half Irish, and I believe that this absolutely preposterous; I would report, or, even bring, by force of arms if necessary, any Irish «immigrant» who was present in the United States of America under false pretences. </p>
<p>  Americans (real Americans), have to understand, the Irish, just like Muslim immigrants, just like the various «strain» of Asian immigrants, do not like America. Irish, whether here, or back home, in «the old sod,» hate America. </p>
<p>  This was brought home to me, many years ago, when I was sent to «visit» (sic), my father&rsquo;s elder sister, who, herself, had lived in «America» otherwise, Brooklyn, during the late 1950&rsquo;s. The sneering, the intense, pathological contempt - and real hatred of «America» and «the Americans» as my father&rsquo;s sister termed them, (they were, in fact, her own relatives), was incredible to me. Non Obstant the fact that these people had, on repeated occasions, offered free accomodation, free transportation, and, above all, free food, on her repeated trips back to «America.»</p>
<p>  Anyone who reads an Irish newspaper: «The Western People,» «the Connaught Sentinel,» «The Irish Times,» is struck, or ought to be, by the sneering, deprecating, condescending tone of articles written about «America.» I do believe however, that, now that many, if not most Irish newspapers are on line, the anti - American bias - which used to be very («very») overt, has been muted. Somewhat.</p>
<p>  Nevertheless, the Irish hate America;  it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. How can a people, an entire people, whoese entire lives, from birth to death are «wrapped up» in immigration - to America, hate America so much? I don&rsquo;t even know. But this hatred of America, this contempt for America, this envy and resentment for America, is embedded in the psychological profile of the Irish people. It makes no sense. </p>
<p>  It certainly makes no sense from the perspective of the fact that, by agitating for open borders immigration, the Irish are, literally, cutting their own throats.  Irish cannot compete, demographically with 730 million Hispanics. Irish cannot compete, intellectually, with over a billion Asians. Yet they advocate and agitate for modifications of gvernment policies that will, even in the intermediate term, if their proposals become law, harm themselves. Again, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>  The Irish, as I have observed before in this page, hate America, America has done so much for Ireland, for the Irish, both here and «over there.» But, the hated and resentment, the illogical, barbaric desire to destroy has never diminished. The current economic circumstances in Ireland, which, again, were of Ireland&rsquo;s own making and none of «America&rsquo;s» affair, have, I believe, only served to exacerbate the unreasoning and irrational rage that most (I believe), Irish people possess toward the United States.</p>
<p>  The American people must realize that the Irish are not their friends. The American people must realize that Ireland is not a friend of America. Unlike most Hispanics, they speak English; but, they are not our friends. Unlike Asians, they are Northern European Caucasian, but, they are not our friends. They are as distant, from us, and as hostile, to us, as the peoples of «Barbary» otherwise, North Africa, were from the people of Northern and Southern Europe, whom they raided mercilessly for slaves, between c. 1415 and 1830. </p>

		<p>I must say that I agree with GetBackJack by about 100%!</p>
<p>My ancestry is around 25% Irish and I must say that while I do feel some mild (for lack of a better word) sympathy toward Irish immigrants to this country, just like all other whites from across this planet because of the 1965 restrictions against them, that mild sympathy does not overshadow my tenacious resolve that the 12 million to 30 million illegal alien nonwhites must expelled from this country at all costs. Also, an illegal alien is still an illegal alien even if he is white, be he Irish or otherwise. Arguments about &ldquo;caring and compassionate&rdquo; solutions do not move me, nor does the idea that maybe 100,000 to a mere million illegal white &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; granted an &ldquo;amnesty,&rdquo; offers an acceptable counterbalance to the Third World alien hordes that would accompany them on this mendaciously elitist social experiment of invasive altruism, that is in reality nothing more than a racial and national genocide for the USA!</p>
<p>In the future, perhaps the Irish and all other whites will be granted pre-1965 immigration privileges into the USA again? However, until that day comes, it is better that we restrict the problem almost universally to maintain our present 65% or so white majority. The only exception that I would offer to this rule, would be to the remaining white African peoples such as Afrikaners and Rhodesians, who we so callously knifed in the back when it was convenient for us to do so!</p>
<p>God forgive us all in the West, for that sanctimonious atrocity!!!</p>

		<p>I agree with GetBackJack above, sadly. Illegal is illegal. The sad thing is that prior to 1965 when a sponsor and a job were required they would have been contributing workers. Now the criteria is changed. As in the influx of PR&rsquo;s to New York in the 50&rsquo;s. the Voting block is always in the mix.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry!!! Immigration will cease to be a problem all by itself.</p>
<p> Once America crumbles under the weight of law breaking illegals, they&rsquo;ll stop coming here. Once the masses fill every last bit of arable land, they&rsquo;ll stop moving here. Once fresh air, fresh food, safe neighborhoods and plentiful energy are figments of old fool&rsquo;s imaginations, the problem will be illegal <b>emigrants</b>! </p>

		<p>Actually a lot of these stories are put out by the same marxists who run the US media and much of the media through the West. These are the same &#8220;Irish&#8221; who are trying to convince the folks in Ireland it&rsquo;s in their best interests to hop into the European union.

		<p>As much I hate to say it, given my extreme pride in and love for fellow Irishmen, these guys have got to go. Them being here illegally is no differant than the hordes of Mexican illegals flooding past our defenses every day.<br>
Fair is fair and these strangers are not yet welcome here just as any other group who cuts corners and ignores our laws. Give them a one way trip home and instructions on where the back of the line is and how to properly apply to come here legally just like everyone else.</p>

		<p>I thought Ireland itself was having problems with third-worlders moving there illegally. I remember reading an article a few years back about how Nigerian illegal aliens had Irish citizen children (anchor babies) and were trying to use them to keep from being deported.  The 50,000 illegal Irish immigrants living in the US should go back to the mother country and rid it of the very recent wave of third-worlders who have flowed in. <br>
don&rsquo;t let your beautiful country become like England, France, the Netherlands, etc. with their immigrant slums. </p>

		<p>I am of Irish ancestry but from the early 1700s, so I am unable to trace just how my ancestors arrived or why they came.  This group is completely wrong in trying to make &#8216;arrangements&rsquo; for people who came illegally.  Irish, Mexicans, any brand of South American, African and all who came illegally need to return to where they came from and come legally or not at all.  We don&rsquo;t need or want them unless they come by invitation and agree to assimilate to our culture, while we still have a culture.</p>
<p>Eisenhower found the will and a way to repatriate uninvited residents and so can we. If we start deporting when we find them then many will self deport before they are caught.  They will never leave if we aren&rsquo;t serious about controlling our immigration.</p>

		<p>Many of these Irish illegals are concentrated in Boston where they have become spoiled into thinking they&rsquo;ll get their way because the local &#8220;Oirish-American&#8221; segment of the population practically worships them. There is good will towards people from Ireland across the U.S. but it doesn&rsquo;t go to the extreme as the Hibernophilia of Boston where Irish nationals are favored over native-born citizens.</p>

		<p> I swear the media thinks we are all a bunch of racist children. They think using the irish for a white face is going to work to get their amnesty bill passed simply because in their shallow minds they assume it&rsquo;s because we hate latinos that we are against illegal immigration. What fools they don&rsquo;t have a clue it&rsquo;s because the illegal aliens drive down wages and we don&rsquo;t need more people stupid!<br>
  I welcome legal immigrants and surely would prefer Europeons over latinos since they are proven to assimulate more easily to our culture but rewarding criminal behavoir is against everyones principles.</p>

		<p>Three of my four g-grandparents on the maternal side came from Ireland, but if you&rsquo;re illegal, no matter where you&rsquo;re from, you don&rsquo;t deserve amnesty nor citizenship EVER. We have laws now and if your first act was to dishonor our laws, you will never be a true American. Go home and work to bring your own country to a point where you are proud to be a citizen. We don&rsquo;t need any more criminals. We have plenty, thank you.</p>

		<p>Of course, the irony of the Irish identity is completely wrapped up in this issue.  After all, it was Ted Kennedy who pushed through the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965.  And there&rsquo;s the irony; their family gained riches in America, and not completely legally either.  Regardless, this is something that they could not have acheived back in Ireland. Yet, because of their Irish-Catholic identity, they were driven to destroy what it was that provided for their rise in America.</p>
<p>The families ties to the mafia got them into trouble when they became &#8220;holier than thou&#8221; and went after the mob as Senators and later when Bobby Kennedy went after them as AG.</p>
<p>But this is typically Irish.  In addition to decades of study of Ireland history and culture, I have traveled in Ireland extensively.  One easy tour that any can hire out of Dublin is a tour of the Boyne Valley.  There you may visit Neolithic sites like Newgrange or Tara and also hear of the famous 1690 Battle of the Boyne, where James Stewart, the King of Britain was defeated by William of Orange.  James had all the advantages and ought to have won except for one flaw; a drunken Irish officer wandered into the pickets of the Protestants the night before the battle and exposed the Catholic King&rsquo;s strategy - so very Irish.  The Irish are historically and culturally a people who do themselves in by compulsion.  </p>
<p>I have always loved Ireland, none-the-less, and I hope that they will snap out of their self-view as victims and downtrodden, identifying with every non-white oppressed group in the world, before it is too late for them.</p>

<p>THis is absolute nonsense.  Ireland follows everything that America does;  the NFL is very popular and Irish love US politics.  Any negatives toward USA is as a result of self hating American press:  i.e. NY Times, AP etc.CNN;  CNN international is so anti American they should be tried for treason.  The Irish government has always been US camp  &mdash;  perhaps the most public example is that they routinely issued passports to CIA agents in order to have a &#8220;neutral&#8221; country identification.</p>
<p>Under the Irish Constitution, Ireland is supposed to be neutral, but has made Shannon airport available for US Military flights to the Middle East and beyond and sent one of its two Coastal Patrol planes to New York after 9/11 to aid the Coast Guard&rsquo;s mission.</p>

		<p>  The Border Patrol and Immigration catch illegal aliens from all over the world. We get more hispanics because we have a contiguous border with Mexico, so it&rsquo;s easy for them because the only have to travel across land. Also, most of their countries are in dire straits. As stated above, my feeling is that people should stay and fix what&rsquo;s wrong with their own country. If I won $100,000,000 I&rsquo;d have all kinds of options. I could live wherever I wanted to in the world. But I&rsquo;d stay here and use the money as best I could to help get the country back to its core values. <br>
  As for as illegal immigrants, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where they&rsquo;re from-as soon as they enter illegally, they&rsquo;ve demonstated their contempt for our country and its laws. To those who say we can&rsquo;t deport 12,000,000 people I say nonsense-we move entire divisions of military forces and all their equipment,all over the world, often to little benefit, IMHO. We can certainly deport people, and get a better return on the investment.</p>

<p>I think the reason for the stereotype of anti-white obsessiveness on the part of Irish-American Catholics until relatively recently is that they feared continual WASPey/Brahminey persecution.  Once the persecution stopped, then the Irish-American Catholic liberalism waned. </p>
<p>For much the same reason, this explains Jewish liberalism, fear of continued persecution by gentiles.  I think over time, as anti-Semitism becomes more and more obsolete, the Jewish vote and Jewish sensibilities will divide up between left and right.  A similar situation presents in Finland, where Swedes are a small but powerful minority (see the AR article, &#8220;Race in Finland,&#8221; search the archives.)  Swedes in Finland push a liberal race ideology because they&rsquo;re scared of the consequences of the (real) Finns discovering that they&rsquo;re Finns and Swedes aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As much as one wants to make jokes about alcohol, the Irish everywhere seem to be great with computers, CS/IT.  The biggest reason for the recent &#8220;Celtic Tiger&#8221; economy in Ireland (even though it&rsquo;s faded some) is because various tech companies set up shop because the Irish know how to get things working in that regard.  Even in America, Australia and other places, you will see a lot of Irish surnames among those who are the most innovative in CS and IT.  My former barber back in St. Louis, three of his four grandparents were Irish, told me a joke   &mdash;   God put a bottle of whiskey in front of an Irishman to keep him humble, then put a computer in front of him to bring him back up.</p>

		<p>Though I have Irish blood flowing in my own veins, I have NO sympathy whatsoever  with these Irish illegals. None at all.  Should I defend law-breakers simply because they are Irish? The law is the law, and an illegal is an illegal.</p>
<p>Whatsmore (to make it all the more idiotic) should we accept 20 million other illegal aliens in order to excuse 50,000 illegal Irish?    Absolutely not!!! That would be madness.</p>

		<p>As someone outside the circle but keenly interested as such actions could be copied in Europe, all those descibed here who are in the USA illegally are criminals.  They have already broken US laws so why should they be accepted?  If they have no conscience about having become premeditated criminals already, what is to stop them breaking any laws in the future?    </p>
<p>Kick all the illegal immigrants out, NOW but I foresee that the World is getting too overcrowded so countries that have earnt their civilised status need to be very cautious and stop the left wing/liberals from throwing away all the benefits hard earnt by our antecedents by allowing those who cannot be bothered to work hard to improve their countries from flooding in as this is a weakness of democracy where eventually they will procreate and vote in their own kind - and religion and bang goes another civilisation.. </p>

		<p>Finn - I&rsquo;d ignore &#8220;Anonymous&#8221;. He posted here before as David.M Kine and has also posted some of the most loopy and baseless anti-Irish propaganda I&rsquo;ve ever read. Just let him ramble in his own little world.</p>
<p>Whiteplight - James did not have all the advantages. William had a vastly superior and well equipped army that was financed by the Vatican. <br>
Check out the early Presidents of Irish stock, early pioneers and their role in the American independence movement before making those cracks.</p>

		<p>As an Irish person from County Armagh who emigrated here LEGALLY in 2000, I say - deport them all!</p>
<p>I could have sneaked into America years ago but instead my brother and I applied from green cards and waited six years to be accepted and then had to go through a ton of red tape before finally moving to the states and pledgeing our allegiance to the flag in the summer of 2000.</p>
<p>My brother is a Doctor in Missouri and I&rsquo;m currently training to be a Police officer in Boston.</p>
<p>These illegals are cue jumpers and criminals who give us decent legal Irish immigrants a bad name. Send all 50,000 of them back and let them reapply again legally like what we did.&#8221;<br>
       <br>
Could not have said it better. My grandparents immigrated here legally in 1948, just as you did. They love America. They waited their turn just like everyone else and just as you did. These illegal Irish just want a free green card just because of all the good and honorable things past Irish immigrants have done for this great country. Its all a scam. They deserve nothing. They even got the audacity to act like they are better than illegal Mexicans. I give the Mexicans credit for crossing a desert rather than hopping a plane just like they did. It truly is despicable.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
What?  Did I read that correctly?   The Protestant William of Orange was financed by the Vatican?  Hard to believe! </p>
<p>I had to check.  And indeed you are correct! </p>
<p>The alliances were extremely complex and not along neat religious lines. Furthermore, the Battle of the Boyne was at its time seen as having relatively minor importance. It was overshadowed by a French victory 2 days later which was seen as a far more serious event.  In fact, the<b><i> Battle of Aughrim,</i></b> a year later, was  of much greater historical significance, and was indeed  the most bloody battle ever fought on Irish soil.  It sealed the end of the Catholic cause in Ireland and of the old aristocracy.</p>
<p>In truth, both armies at the Boyne were religiously mixed; William of Orange&rsquo;s own elite force  &mdash;  the Dutch Blue Guards  &mdash;  <b><i>had a papal banner with them on that day, </i></b>many of them being Dutch Catholics.   They were part of the League of Augsburg, a cross-denominational alliance   <i><b>supported by the Vatican  </b></i>and designed to stop a French conquest of Europe. </p>
<p>The casualty figures at the Boyne were quite low for a battle of such a scale. The treaty of Limerick that was written was very generous to Catholics. It allowed most land owners to keep their land so long as they swore allegiance to William of Orange.</p>
<p>However, at Aughrim, which took place a year after the Boyne, virtually all of the Irish Catholic and old English aristocracies  were wiped out [Wikipedia].  What was celebrated on &#8220;The Twelfth&#8221; was not William&rsquo;s &#8220;victory over Popery at the Battle of the Boyne&#8221;, but the extermination of the elite of the Catholic Irish at Aughrim, thereby ending the fear of having to surrender the planted lands.<br>

<p>Conan, why did the vatican finance William who in 1688 invaded England and overthrew a Catholic King (James) with a Catholic heir.  Since the vatican had wanted to bring England back into the fold since the 1530&rsquo;s this does not seem to make sense.</p>
<p>If the vatican financed any party to this war, it would have been James.</p>
<p>Please explain more about this.<br>

<p>It makes sense, dear Margaret, because the Vatican formed a part of the League of Augsburg which sought, above all,  to avert a French conquest of Europe by Louis XIV.  King James (of Britain and Ireland) was a puppet of  France.  Thus, the Vatican backed  Dutch William.    But William was married to Mary, the daughter of James, who became in time Queen Mary! (And in turn, her sister, Queen Anne.)   Very complex! </p>
