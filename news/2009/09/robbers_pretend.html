	<p>Cops arrested Benjamin Thompson (l.) and Vance Jackson after they allegedly robbed a Long Island home after pretending to be salesmen selling President Obama&rsquo;s health insurance policies.</p>
<p>Cops arrested Benjamin Thompson (l.) and Vance Jackson after they allegedly robbed a Long Island home after pretending to be salesmen selling President Obama&rsquo;s health insurance policies.</p>
<p>A trio of robbers used President Obama&rsquo;s health care plan as a ruse to invade a Long Island home where they shot two people and pistol-whipped a third, cops said Saturday.</p>
<p>Suffolk County cops nabbed Benjamin Thompson and Vance Jackson shortly after they forced their way into the Huntington home, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The team posed as salespeople hawking fictional Obama insurance policies when they approached the Virginia Ave. home about noon on Friday.</p>
<p>They pushed their way inside and demanded cash  &mdash;  slugging one woman with a gun and shooting another in the foot, cops said.</p>
<p>The thugs opened fire on an unidentified man, shooting him in the neck, chest, shoulder and back.</p>

		<p>My two great emancipations in life were realizing I don`t have to pick up the phone or open the  front door. At first I thought that if they looked like &#8216;neighborhood&rsquo; kids I would open. Then it came to me that half the time they are working on the side of &#8216;issues&#8221; I want nothing to do with. So now, nobody gets an open door. I walk up to the window next to the door, put a broken cellphone to my ear and make a motion with my free hand that I am busy and to leave me alone. Of course I also watch them walk down the steps to make sure no flower pots are kicked in anger as they leave. Funny how great it feels  every time I thwart an interloper&hellip;Try it and feel the freedom.</p>

<p>Are they sure it was a ruse?</p>
<p>Sounds to me like what the Democrats and the MSM are doing to unsuspecting people right now to get the bill passed.</p>
<p>These incidents will be commplace AFTER the bill is passed.</p>

		<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t the ruse of two employed black men been easy enough to sniff out?  My sympathies to the victims, my warning to those who haven&rsquo;t adopted the AmRen wisdom and applied it to their lives.</p>

		<p>Too bad those poor victims didn&rsquo;t have an intercom. Only a sentence or two of their ghetto English would have been enough convincing that they were some sort of scam. </p>
<p>White people need to install cameras by their front doors so they can see who is there before opening up. As time goes by, it will be harder and harder to get away from these types of low-lifes as non-white people and their crime proliferate all over the country.</p>

		<p>Does anyone know the race of the VICTIMS? My first thought was that it must be blacks, because no one else in their right mind would open the door to these goons. But then I started thinking about all those dumb liberal Whites with their P.C. mentality. Now I am not sure. I would like to know just out of curiousity&hellip;</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need a camera, although there is nothing wrong with it. Just put in one of those peepholes that apartment doors have. You can buy them in a lot of places and they are simple to install. I got tired of having blacks coming to my door trying to scam me out of money for some bogus &#8220;charity&#8221;. Now I look to see who it is and just don&rsquo;t answer the door.</p>
