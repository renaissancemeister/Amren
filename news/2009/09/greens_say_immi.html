<h1>Greens Say Immigration Bad for Environment</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AAP, Sept. 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AUSTRALIA&rsquo;S population soared by almost half a million people in the year to March  &mdash;  a boom not seen since the 1960s.</p>
<p>A green group says that&rsquo;s no cause for celebration and has called for immigration to be cut to protect the environment.</p>
<p>Australian Bureau of Statistics data released today shows the population increased by just over two per cent  &mdash;  or 439,000 people  &mdash;  in the year to March.</p>
<p>There are now 21.8 million of us.</p>
<p>Most of the recent increase  &mdash;  almost 300,000 people  &mdash;  was due to immigration.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a mini-baby boom, with 160,000 babies entering the world during the year.</p>
<p>Recent research showed Australia&rsquo;s population would balloon to 35 million  &mdash;  seven million more than previously thought  &mdash;  on the strength of immigration and births over the next 40 years.</p>
<p>The Government said the population boom was great news because it meant the economy would keep growing.</p>
<p>But some green groups say enough is enough.</p>
<p>Australian Conservation Foundation spokesman Charles Berger said the growing population was on a collision course with the environment.</p>
<p>More people  &mdash;  as outlined in the ABS data  &mdash;  meant more greenhouse pollution, poorer river health and struggling infrastructure.</p>
<p>Every extra million people added 25 million tonnes of greenhouse pollution, Mr Berger said. </p>
<p>He called for migration to be cut to &#8220;more sustainable levels&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot continue to add the equivalent of a city larger than Canberra every year to Australia&rsquo;s population and still expect to maintain the health of our environment and our quality of life.&#8221; </p>
<p>The ABS data showed Western Australia was leading the population proliferation, while Tasmania lagged in last place.</p>
<p>All states and territories recorded an increase. <br/>

		<p>When I looked at the title of the article, I immediately knew that it could not possibly be in relation to the Green movement in the U.S. The U.S. Greens, love, indeed, fight Americans trying to stop illegal immigration,and they do it vigorously. When you have flakes like reconquista Peter Camejo, running for President on the Green Party platform, that says all you need to know about the Green Party in the U.S.</p>

		<p>21.8 million to 35 million in 40 years?  That&rsquo;s a lie.  Third World invaders reproduce much faster than that, particularly when they&rsquo;ve got Whites to support them. </p>
<p>And btw, how many of those 160,000 babies were Australian?  </p>

		<p>On a related note, this is what makes Brenda Walker of VDare.com practically unique in this country  &mdash;  she is a progressive feminist who is anti-immigration.  It&rsquo;s quite odd that progressivists, feminists, and environmentalists in this country don&rsquo;t realize that massive third-world immigration will not lead to a &#8220;progressive&#8221; society.  It will lead to a backwards, third-world society like the very ones the immigrants are fleeing.</p>

		<p>Anyone who has lived in places where there is a large influx of immigrants and blacks can clearly see they are bad for the environment.  Every morning I walk to work through &#8220;minority areas&#8221; and I pass parks and streets littered with plastic cups, styrofoam plates, bottles, cans, rotting food, everything imaginable.  It&rsquo;s interesting to note that the trashcans most of the trash is scattered around remain empty.  The subways and buses are also littered with chicken bones and trash, and even school bus drivers will open their doors to throw trash to the curb.</p>

		<p>You can look at immigration and the environment two ways. On the one hand the environment is a global system with all parts inter-connected so one could argue that a global government is required. Here immigration hastens one world government. On the other hand one could look at the environment as part of human society so each nation needs to find its own balances and motivations for protection. Here immigration causes social chaos and should be stopped. I don&rsquo;t know what is best in the long run but I still think that the best choice for now is to work with independent nations and their cultures. This gives the best methods to get inside people&rsquo;s hearts and minds to make the necessary sacrifices. Therefore stop immigration and immigration restrictionists need to make strong efforts to help the environment. </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, for most liberals, race trumps everything.  This is why Greens in the U.S. and America push for open borders and feminists in Scandanavia turn a blind eye to Muslim gang rape.  </p>

		<p>The Green Party here in the United States should be called the Watermelon Party   &mdash;   green on the outside, red on the inside.  The Sierra Club is little better   &mdash;   they vilify anyone who calls for reducing immigration so we can stabilize our population.</p>

		<p>An Australia with a population of 35 million - there&rsquo;s something I never signed up for when I migrated here 25 years ago, particularly considering such a huge percentage of them are going to be (and already are) third worlders, and the consequences of that has for a while now been rearing it&rsquo;s ugly head. Also, if I wanted to live in Hong Kong or Tokyo-style conditions I&rsquo;d have made the move a while ago. How dare they do that to us? I miss the 80&rsquo;s and early 90&rsquo;s before this madness had begun to be unleashed upon us.</p>

<p>Actually, Australia has a much higher percentage of white immigration (particularly from New Zealand and the U.K) than the U.S. has. Most non-white immigrants come from East Asia, and East Asians doesn&rsquo;t have a higher birth rate than whites. </p>

		<p>The news here is that some of the modern Green party are rediscovering the Zero Population Movement of the &rsquo;50s, 60s, and 70s that died somewhere in the 80s.  But only Northern European and English speaking cultures comphrehended the threat of an over-populated world.  </p>
<p>It continues to look bad for the white race, but folks, it is bad for the entire human race.  The shortages and enviromental propblems due to over-population will soon dwarf every other consideration as everyone will compete more fiercely, and more openly for the dwindling remains.  I plan to at least go down fighting.</p>

		<p>The big problem with a large population in Australia would be water use.  Australia is basically a desert with a narrow ring around it.  While this narrow ring of woodland is pleasant to live in (a look on the map at the location of Australia&rsquo;s cities and towns is quite illustrative), it is also home to many now-endangered animals.  The primary cause of their endangered status is habitat destruction.  If you cut down a forest in order to build a subdivision for 20,000 Pakistani immigrants, along with the usual mosque, strip-malls and the like, there will never be another koala there again.  We already have a Pakistan, after all; where is Australia&rsquo;s unique wildlife supposed to emigrate to?</p>

		<p>As a number of other commenters have noted, it is curious how most progressive movements in the West promote multiculturalism.  The values of minority cultures are inimical to almost everything that (White) progressives believe in.  White feminists?  Take a look at the rape stats and the gross misogyny in black and other non-White cultures.  Gay?  Good luck not getting bashed or killed by blacks and muslims.  Environmentalist?  Drive through any hispanic or black community to see how much they care for the environment.  These so-called progressives often demonize straight white men for holding non-P.C. views.  But the views of race-realists are often more compatible with the society envisioned by these progressives than are the dogmas and antiquated lifestyles of muslims, blacks and hispanics.</p>

		<p>10 MW: Do you have numbers on non-White immigration to Australia?  I&rsquo;m willing to believe you if you&rsquo;ve got some, but I&rsquo;ve read a number of articles about crime and  race riots down there, and it&rsquo;s always Middle Easterners.  <br/>
       Not, btw, that I find &#8220;law abiding&#8221; Orientals any less threatening to White civilization.</p>

<p>I live in Sydney, which has become a third world cess pit.  I challenge MW to convince me that the East Asian tribes I see on a daily basis produce less of them than us whites.</p>
<p>Although Asians dominate the landscape in our cities, there is also significant numbers of Indians, Middle Easterners and Pacific Islanders, all too willing to enrich our previously stable and cohesive society.      <br/>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t find any recent ethnic statistics but during 2004-05, 123,424 people immigrated to Australia. Of them, 17,736 were from Africa, 54,804 from Asia, 21,131 from Oceania, 18,220 from the United Kingdom, 1,506 from South America, and 2,369 from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t help us much though as &#8216;Africa&rsquo; includes White South Africans and Oceania includes White New Zealanders, but hopefully it gives you an outline of where people are coming from.</p>

		<p>To &#8220;Schoolteacher&#8221; and &#8220;Pround Australian&#8221;:</p>
<p>I am not aware of any race or ethnicity based birth statistics in Australia so I cannot for sure say anything about the exact birth rate of Asians in Australia. But if you look at demographic statistics from for example Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, you can see that the birth rate there is far lower than in Europe-and Australia.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t mean to suggest that immigration of East Asians is a good thing. I simply pointed out that they aren&rsquo;t likely to reproduce themselves as fast as Middle Easterners, blacks or hispanics.  </p>

		<p>17 MW: In China, couples are allowed only one child, but they don&rsquo;t limit themselves like that when they come to the U.S.  Korea and Japan don&rsquo;t legally limit the number of children, but the crowding and cost of living do.  That might be one of the attractions of moving to a White country, that they can have more kids.  </p>

<p>You are right Kevin. You just need to look at the &#8220;Bigger&#8221; picture. The Progressives&rsquo; goal is Not to &#8220;save the whales&#8221; or &#8220;stop global warming&#8221; or &#8220;end poverty&#8221;. The goal of progressives is to completely tear down (White) Western Civilization and it&rsquo;s ideal of all men/women being born free and living as sovereign individuals. <br/>
Progressives believe there should be a &#8220;One World&#8221; global government run by a few &#8220;Elite&#8221; &#8220;Intellectuals&#8221; that control every aspect of the human condition (for our own good of course).<br/>
They use &#8220;causes&#8221; like the environment or global warming as fronts to scare/ guilt people into giving them more money and more power.<br/>
That is why the Sierra Club will fight tooth and nail to prevent a shopping mall going up that might endanger the &#8220;jumping fluff mouse&#8221; in one small field, which keeps it&rsquo;s base happy, but at the same time will totally ignore illegal immigration in the same area that has a devestating actual effect on the environment along vast stretches of pristine desert. Illegal immigrants weaken the country and destroy the fabric of this nation, that serves the progressive plan.<br/>
Shutting down development by getting labrynthine radical environmental laws passed also serves the progressive plan. <br/>
The end goal is Power. Power to dictate! Power to control every aspect of every man,woman and child from cradle to grave.  </p>
<p>Western Feminism vs. Islam&rsquo;s barbaric treatment of women? <br/>
Judeo-Christian views of homosexuality vs. muslims beheading gays for being gay?<br/>
Colonial Slavery 140 years ago vs. Modern Slavery in Africa Today?<br/>
See a pattern here?<br/>
The bad guy is always White, Male and Western!<br/>
Progressives are playing both sides of the same coin.<br/>
Heads or Tails, we all get screwed.<br/>
