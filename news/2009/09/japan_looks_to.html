<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8234463.stm">Japan Looks to Robots to Fill Jobs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robin Lustig, BBC News, September 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the biggest questions hanging over the newly elected Japanese government is what it intends to do about its rapidly diminishing workforce.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s population is both ageing and shrinking at a dangerous rate. It will have halved by the end of the century, according to one estimate.</p>
<p>So who is going to do the work as the country gets steadily older?</p>
<p>The first thing the government plans to do is increase the child allowance to 25,000 yen ($270, Â£166) per child per month  &mdash;  the hope is that will encourage couples to have more babies.</p>
<p>But if that does not work, there are two other options  &mdash;  build more robots to do the work there are not enough people to do, or allow in millions more workers from overseas.</p>
<p>I met a couple of robots in Arai Sadahiro&rsquo;s robot shop in Tokyo.</p>
<p>They talked and sang to him just as they would to a lonely elderly person in need of company.</p>
<p>Mr Sadahiro insists that, although of course it would be better if a real friend or relative were available, the robots are not a bad second best.</p>
<p>For social and medical care, robots are already in use. There are robots that can lift patients out of bed, carry them if necessary, even act as receptionists in a hospital or doctor&rsquo;s surgery.</p>
<p>But would it not be even better to import more workers from abroad?</p>
<p>After all, Japan has the lowest rate of foreign workers among the world&rsquo;s major developed economies  &mdash;  making up less than 2% of the workforce, compared with close to 15% in the US, or 10% in Britain.</p>
<p><b>Centenarians</b></p>
<p>The biggest number of migrants come from Korea and China, many on government-sponsored three-year training programmes meant to equip them with new skills to take back home.</p>
<p>But some migrant workers say the training schemes can sometimes be little more than a way of exploiting low-paid migrants.</p>
<p>One Chinese worker, who chose to remain anonymous, said he felt &#8220;tricked&#8221; when he found he was expected to pick strawberries all day with no training on offer.</p>
<p>Other foreign workers have a much better experience  &mdash;  such as Indian businessman Jagmohan Chandrani, who has lived in Japan for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>He runs a tea-importing business and a restaurant, and says the big advantage that Indians have here is that many possess valuable Information Technology skills that Japan needs.</p>
<p>So what will it be? More robots, or more foreign workers? My guess is that it will be both.</p>
<p>Something certainly needs to be done. The United Nations estimates that by the middle of the century there will be more than a million Japanese who are over 100 years old.</p>
<p>And someone will have to look after them.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Japan&rsquo;s population may be halved by the end of the century&#8221;,,,,</p>
<p>So what? This would still give Japan a larger population then Britain has today. Japan would have a lot more space and open room (it is a terribly crowded country), less pressure on the environment and ecology and real estate would be cheaper and more accessible to the average Japanese. Japan would also be much less dependent on overseas food supplies. Its not like the Japanese are going to dissapear of the face of the Earth.</p>

		<p>If Japan imported some immigrants to do menial labor, then who would take care of THEM in 50 years?  Even more immigrants?  This article is basically an advertisement for a Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>Also, I wonder how often these robots commit rape or muggings?  Probably less often than immigrants.</p>

		<p>Part of the problem is that Japan is a small island and is crowded and very expensive. However, Japan ought to focus on making things very favorable for couples to have children even if it means paying them big bucks. One baby boom could solve their problems for a long time.</p>

<p>Interesting contrast, between Japanese thinking and the thinking of our hostile, anti-white ruling elites in Washington D.C.   </p>
<p>Over there, the Japanese leaders view the idea of robotics as a means to prevent themselves from being swamped and eventually submerged under waves of immigrants who are totally unlike themselves.</p>
<p>Over here, our so-called leaders view the idea of robotics in the context of predator drones that have zero conscience and who possess zero human compassion and which can be used to slaughter people indiscriminately.  And, these killer robots will also be deployed here in North America and used against you and I, fellow AR readers.  Because we are dissidents and aren&rsquo;t going along with the elites desire to genocide us, you see.  </p>
<p>Is something really wrong with that picture, or what?</p>

		<p>The Japanese are very smart and creative people.  They will easily solve any problems as they bring their population into ecological balance.  The next generation will benefit greatly from a lowered population: There will be lowered taxes, because there will be no need to build new schools, roads, rail lines, dams, and water-, electric-, and sewage-plants.  Housing and land will become incredibly inexpensive, as fewer people compete for the limited space.  Younger generations will become incredibly wealthy, as they inherit the wealth of 2 parents, 4 grand parents, and 8 great-grand parents (wealth will be concentrated, instead of divided among numerous offspring.).  Perhaps the greatest benefit will be that with a lowered population, there will be less stress on the environment   &mdash;   forests will be allowed to grow, land lie fallow and regenerate, toxins wash out of the land, wildlife return, and the fisheries will rebound.  Finally, there will be more peace, solitude and beauty on that grossly overcrowded island.  The grandchildren of today&rsquo;s Japanese will inherit a bright future. </p>

		<p>Maybe Japan just wants to stay Japanese.  Also, they have 127 million people in a country the size of California, not exactly what I would call underpopulated.  Importing foreigners to do the work your own people won&rsquo;t do (at the current wages) is a short term solution that leads to long term problems.  Would France have regular riots and no go zones ringing their cities if they had used a combination of higher wages and greater automation to meet their labor needs rather than importing huge numbers of African Muslims?</p>

		<p>A country can survive a lot of things. Demographic problems can be endured. Japan survived atomic bombs for example. Europe survived the horrors of the black death. What a country can NOT survive is racial replacement. The Japanese are being wise and taking a long term view. For myself if I were living in a homogeneous nation-state and had to choose between labor shortages and ethnic immigration I would certainly choose the former.</p>

		<p>I agree with the above posters that at some point in the future, when housing in Japan is less expensive, the younger Japanese may return to having larger numbers of children.  Right now, Japan is going through a temporary transition period with a labor shortage, but the ever-improving robots may solve a big part of the problem.</p>
<p>Technology and other changes could also transform the way that things are done in Japan.  Japan could allow the best and brightest to sell their eggs and sperm, and use them to create embryos to implant in impoverished Africans.  When the children are five, you put them in Japanese boarding schools, and ten years later they are ready for the workforce.  Or, aging single women in Japan could be offered the chance to have a couple of babies this way, with they children being &#8220;nannied&#8221; in Africa until the mother in Japan is ready to take over.</p>
<p>It beats letting wave after wave of hostile foreigners sweep into your country.</p>

		<p>When ever I read reports such as this one (and I&rsquo;ve been reading them for decades now), I inwardly scream to myself &#8216;What a load of garbage!&rsquo;.<br>
Firstly at present, Japan has an acute unemployment problem with hundreds of thousands of able-bodied good Japanese workers being unable to find jobs due to the world economic depression, so therefore the story is just a trashy lie.<br>
Secondly, consider the case of Saudi Arabia and other rich Gulf Arab oil-exporting states.All these nations have very rapid economic growth, huge infrastructure investments and excellent well-staffed public hospitals and other services.All these things need huge amounts of unskilled labor to keep running and as a rule indigenous Arbs simply refuse to undertake manual labor.<br>
 The answer - the importation of enormous numbers of &#8216;coolie&rsquo; laborers from Asia.And these are genuinely &#8216;guest-workers&rsquo;.Once the job finishes - they go home.Always.Forever.No exceptions.Rigidly and always applied.There are simply no instances of the contracts being violated and &#8216;settlement&rsquo; being accepted - this madness is confined to the soft-headed and soft-hearted degenerates of the west - not to canny hardnosed Arabs.<br>
  Notice also how it&rsquo;s always American and British media (two nations destroyed by immigration), who keep urging the Japanese to repeat their mistake.</p>

And all without having to settle for immigrants from the dark continent coming in to be taken care of while they deplete the rest of Japan&rsquo;s natural resources.  Or having muslims come in and politically ruin them.</p>

<p>This is absolutely correct. NOT ONLY survived but expanded, prospered, and thrived in the afermath of the Black Death. All those dead folks no longer around opened opportunities for those that survived. Land became available that was untilled from the lack of persons to farm, trade positions became available for a populace where the need was made manifest, etc. A vacuum was created, and then filled, &#8220;nature abhoring a vacuum!!</p>

<p>Robots won&rsquo;t go on a rampage, if one should break down, unlike Muslims from the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>Robots don&rsquo;t carry diseases, unlike Mexicans with swine flu.</p>
<p>Robots won&rsquo;t rape, rob or kill Japanese women, unlike Africans.</p>
<p>Robots won&rsquo;t need to be fed, clothed, housed or educated.</p>

		<p>100 years from now, the Japanese will honor their great-grandparents who  had the foresight and altruism to lower their birthrate and thereby bring Japan&rsquo;s population into ecological balance.  At the same time, America with 1 Billion inhabitants will be experiencing new rounds of food riots because of the impossibility to get food into the middle of the giant 40- million-people mega cities.  <br>
With the final pumping of the last remaining oil, tens of thousands will freeze in the north each winter.  With all the aquifers pumped out, there will be no more water for irrigation, and in some places for drinking.  Polluted water will spread diseases and kill millions.  The Japanese, safe on their beautiful and productive island will wonder why we were so ignorant as to let out population rise until everything was consummed.</p>

<p>A true fantasy indeed. As a foreign resident living in Japan, I couldn&rsquo;t disagree more. Japan is in chaotic mess. They just recently elected a new government. The PM wife&rsquo;s is to say the least, rather eccentric. Most Japanese are NOT independently thinking people, always have to rely on dependency, therefore they often, often get into situations that are difficult for them to get out of. They constantly complain about their social living and circumstances and are very short-sighted. Since Japan depends is an Export/Import nation, growing produce in Japan is extremely difficult, nothing grows properly. Most young women &#8220;don&rsquo;t want or not interested in marriage&#8221; or just putting it off. Women are more interested in traveling and meeting  people of different cultures and backgrounds. Men are working longer and harder for a lot less these days. Shops are closing, companies are going under. The only real long-term solution for Japan is to outsource. That is the only thing that can save Japan, do they want to do it, depends on who you ask. But most Japanese are tolerant to people as long as you respect their culture and behave in a civilized manner. I have been living here for 12 years and I can see Japan will never move forward or can make it without foreign labor, that is just a total myth and lie. As an educator, I see children becoming lazier these days, very different from 20 years ago when people studied from morning until the late evening, not the case today. Kids are living longer with their parents, many drop out of school, unemployment is high. So Japan can hate it all they want, but the ugly truth is, if they want to compete with countries like China or S. Korea, Robots will most definitely NOT save Japan from this crisis.</p>

        I don&rsquo;t know what ethnicity or nationality you are, I assume you are an American (possibly a non-White American, but I sincerely wish the Japanse will find you out and instantly deport you as the foul enemy of the Japanese people you are.<br>
 Firstly if you look at the current state of the American economy and the terrible strains in American society (gang warfare in LA, black and mestizo criminality etc, the dumbing down of American education etc, etc), then the USA has absolutely no right to criticise the Japanese.<br>
 As a manufcturing nation Japan still enjoys massive trade surpluses, unlike the USA it has mastered the knack of moving &#8216;upmarket&rsquo; exporting mainly highly sophisticated electronics (made by highly intelligent people), for which there is a massive and indispensible demand worldwide,Compared to that the US&rsquo;s export profile is skewered.<br>
 - And importing grunt dummies doesn&rsquo;t help the deveopment of highly sophisticated computer chips and components one iota.<br>
  Look at high the cars Toyota produce have trounced anything &#8216;diverse and vibrant&rsquo; Detroit produces.<br>
 I love your term &#8216;chaotic mess&rsquo; - the fact is Japanese punctuality, cleanliness and efficiency (compare their railroads to British railroads for example), are respected throughout the world and serve as THE model of efficiency.Compare the Kobe earthquake and the aftermath of Katrina.<br>
 How can a &#8216;chaotic mess&rsquo; build the world&rsquo;s best cars, most sophisticated electronics, best motorcycles, best optical equipment,best ships, have the biggest stock of savings, have the most punctual railroads on earth, have a first class eduation system, very little crime or civil dysfunction for example?<br>
 I hold no brief for the Japanese, but I cannot stand bitter and twisted envious people wanting to bring others down because of their own perceived inferiority - that is probably the worst character flaw possible in any human being.</p>

<p>So your solution is for Japan to import millions of low-wage Chinese or Indian immigrants to &#8220;revitalize&#8221; their factories and export economy?  And what happens when these immigrants get sick or retire?  Who pays for them?  The Japanese will, because these millions of low-wage, large-family workers will never be able to save any money.  As a larger and larger percentage of Japan&rsquo;s GDP is directed toward these &#8220;social costs,&#8221; Japan will need to import even more foreign workers to again bolster the economy and increase the tax base, in a never-ending Population Ponzi scheme.  The eventual result will be a grossly overpopulated Japan, populated not by Japanese, but by Chinese.  The end of the amazing Japanese people and culture.  No! Better to remain Japanese and to preserve Japan for their grandchildren, even if it means slightly lowered standard of living,.  Short-term greed (money   &mdash;   the economy) is not the only reason to exist.   </p>

		<p>Charles, you are wrong. Importing foreigners and &#8220;blending cultures&#8221; is not good for Japan or any other culture, including Africans. Oh, and I know for a fact that Japanese people are becoming more and more lazy (this is true for most of the world, sadly) and Japan isn&rsquo;t the fantasy that many people (including Anime fans and White Nationalists) claim it to be. The only thing that is true is that many Japanese women are trying to find men outside of their race (excluding Blacks, of course).</p>

<p>Well, you are right on almost all points except the one about blending cultures and blacks. In my town and other towns across the country and in one of my bars. I have seen a huge increase of Japanese/Black relationships marriages. I do not keep tab on how many there are, which is in my opinion ridiculous. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, I think more power to them. I often see mixed kids around here and I live in the 3rd largest city in Japan.  I know this, because there are many people from Senegal, Nigerian, South African, Ghana. Most of them have businesses here, work hard and one is a TV personality, speak fluent Japanese, so they do quite well.</p>

I am is not the issue. I am a born American, who became a naturalized citizen. If I wallowed in Japan&rsquo;s destruction and hated it, why would I live in Japan and why would I marry and have children with a Japanese, wise up and lastly Japan is already doing a good job at bringing itself down, especially with this new government that in large part want to copy many of Obama&rsquo;s health care reform. Overwhelmingly, most younger Japanese want the government to take care of them, That is good for Japan&rsquo;s economic growth and overall prosperity?</p>

<p>No more than Whites coming to Japan to become &#8220;pedophiles&#8221; Anyway, that kind of babble is childish and shows lack of intelligence on your part.  Most Blacks and other minorities have businesses in TV, Music, Fashion, Engineering, Science. Sorry, drug dealing in Japan gets you arrested and a one way ticket back to your country of origin, which doesn&rsquo;t happen to much and the drugs that do make it there way in Japan&hellip;talk to the Russians and N. Koreans about that.  Besides, what does all this have anything to do with you, you are not Japanese, so it shouldn&rsquo;t concern you whether Japan will do well with Foreigners or not, this will not impact or impede on your life in any way.</p>

        I find it hard to believe that your posts are genuine, or if so you are delusional.the statement that blacks in Japan have businesses in TV, Music, Fashion, Engineering, Science incredulous.<br>
 For starters I cannot see how blacks operate &#8216;Engineering and Science&rsquo; businesses in Japan when the country is the world leader in those fields, entry into those fields requires a huge capital outlay (unless you call bicycle repair &#8216;engineering&rsquo;),citations, contacts, networks, a very good knowledge of Japanese, a very good knowledge of government regulation etc.Condsidering that a few very big combines dominate scientific and engineering research (working in conjunction with MITI and university departments), I cannot see how any foreigner can even make a start with an &#8216;engineering business&rsquo; in Japan, plus the fact it&rsquo;s the most expensive place in the world to operate.<br>
 As far as I know even big American business has failed to make inroads in opening factories and research establishments in Japan.<br>
 Yes, I&rsquo;m not Japanese, but it would be rather sad to see them destroy themselves.<br>
 Whenever someone calls themself a &#8216;born American&rsquo; and huffily refuses to describe their ethnicity, my radar picks up immediately.<br>

<p>Kenelm,</p>
<p>It is Ok if you find it hard to believe. I am just stating the facts. I live and work here. I see and know what exactly is going on and if you don&rsquo;t like or disapprove of it, matters little to me. I don&rsquo;t have to prove anything. It is obvious that you have a personal problem with me and it shouldn&rsquo;t affect you. I am just responding to this thread to give and opinion and insight of my adopted home, that&rsquo;s all.<br>
Also, you don&rsquo;t want to accept that Blacks(and this was never solely about Blacks)and other minorities contribute to society here. I hate to disappoint you, but in this city, there is a very famous university that has a very large ethnic mix and that includes, Mexicans and Blacks in fields of Science-Micro Biology, research, Environmental and yes, in order to even be considered to enter the University, you have to be able to speak, read and write basic Japanese, skills that they have. The same is also extended to the field of government. I never said it was easy, in fact, it is extremely difficult, all the more reason that I have the utmost respect for these people that come and want to make a difference and work their tails off, which the Japanese admire, they seize the opportunity that many young Japanese don&rsquo;t do, because many come from power countries, Africa, South East Asia, the middle East the only thing they have and that they can take advantage of is a strong education and as long as culturally sensitive and behave, follow the rules, you will not have a problem here and this is why, many minorities are doing very, very well, Japan is NOT destroying themselves, on the contrary, it is slowly, steadily improving the country to a certain degree.<br>
So I hate to block your radar, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t properly calibrated. Being Born American doesn&rsquo;t mean, that I am obliged to describe myself, it matters not.  I am just an American, that became a naturalized Japanese citizen and proud of it.</p>

		<p>The fact that Charles is a naturalized Japanese citizen (if he&rsquo;s telling the truth) proves that he is not Black.</p>
<p>Foreigners, even if they are White, change the landscape of Japan. Japan is (was) an amazing place because it is (was) Japanese.</p>

		<p>Of course I am telling the truth, I have nothing to gain from lying, for what reason or purpose. I am a confident individual, I enjoy engaging in meaningful dialogue, I think that is very important to understand and respect and look at every angel of different viewpoints. But when it comes to race, I feel that it is not necessary to divulge that information. Also, I have to set the record straight, your &#8220;ethnicity doesn&rsquo;t disqualify&#8221; you from becoming a naturalized citizen in Japan. But you need to be able to be a bit proficient in the Language, especially when you want to do business in Japan and most Blacks that work in the medical field or have their own businesses do read and write Japanese exceptionally well. Actually, Japan is a fairly easy country to enter as long as you are willing to conform, since it is a conformist society. The foreigner pop. is about 3% so before Whites, Blacks, others change the demographics of the country it will take a very, very, very long time. </p>

         In your previous post you waxed lyrical about black Africans owning &#8216;science and engineering businesses&rsquo;, now that&rsquo;s morphed into a certain univeristy being stuffed with third world students.<br>
 I&rsquo;m not too sure about this, but on the business front, I don&rsquo;t know if Japan even allows foreigners to own Japanese property.</p>

		<p>Good for the Japanese.  It turns out robots don&rsquo;t bankrupt hospitals by overcrowding emergency rooms with complaints of minor ailments, robots don&rsquo;t make their neighborhoods unsafe to travel through, and robots don&rsquo;t overcrowd schools with their disciplinary-problem offspring (well, maybe &#8220;von Neumann machine&#8221; robots might do that, but we&rsquo;re a long way from making those.)</p>
