<h1><a href="https://swampland.blogs.time.com/2009/09/22/newt-gingrich-adds-an-hispanic-news-service-the-americano/">Newt Gingrich Adds Hispanic News/Opinion Website</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Scherer, Time, Sept. 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} The former Speaker of the House, and all-around conservative idea-smith, has launched a news website for Hispanic Americans, the rapidly growing segment of swing voters. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://theamericano.com/">The Americano</a>, and it is the bilingual brainchild of Sylvia Garcia, a longtime employee of Gingrich Communications, the former speaker&rsquo;s consulting business. &#8220;The idea came during the election,&#8221; Garcia says. &#8220;There really isn&rsquo;t any media that is covering conservative values for Hispanics. Everything you see is very one-sided.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, conservative-minded Hispanics will find an opinion piece about how voter identification efforts are damaging the GOP brand among Latinos, a &#8220;History of U.S. Elections as Seen By Hispanics,&#8221; and a piece about how the embattled non-profit ACORN was caught in a sting that involved a false claim about 14 El Salvadoran prostitutes.</p>
<p>The new website, which will seek to make a profit from advertising, comes at a time when Republican strategists, and conservative activists, are expressing clear concern over Republican popularity among the Latino electorate, a swing vote in recent presidential contests. {snip}</p>
<p>Garcia, who previously set up Gingrich&rsquo;s own Spanish-language <a href="https://newt.org/Default.aspx?alias=newt.org/paralatinos">website</a>, said that she hopes to attract readers who are looking for conservative views on issues beyond the illegal immigration debate, which tends to alienate Hispanics from the Republican party. &#8220;In recent polls, when Hispanics and Latinos have been asked what is most important to them, immigration comes in fourth or fifth,&#8221; Garcia said. She added that Newt&rsquo;s opinion pieces would be published on the site, but that he would not play a major visible role. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not about Newt. It&rsquo;s not about the speaker. It&rsquo;s really a site about conservatism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Now we finally understand why he was such a sorry Speaker of the House.  Then again, most of us knew that already, and as a matter of fact, when the Republicans won the House in 1994, I wasn&rsquo;t too hot on Nut Gingrich being Speaker.  I thought the new majority should have picked someone else.</p>

		<p>Democrat or Republican are just two sides of the same coin.  He&rsquo;s a supporter of Hispanics.  He&rsquo;s a supporter of amnesty.  He seems to believe that some how, some way, these Hispanics can be converted into good old Hot dogs, Mom and apple pie conservative Americans.  It&rsquo;s difficult to see if he really believes his own nonsense or if it&rsquo;s just a charade.</p>
<p>What kind of a jerk is Gingrich?  Do Mexican politicians set up an English-language website for illegal Americans who invade Mexico and want to take over?  It&rsquo;s so absurd it defies belief.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Whom the gods destroy, they first make mad.&#8221;<br>

		<p>  Gingrich should be dunped from the Conservatives lists and get NO donations.<br>
  This is an English speaking country and no politicians should be using any other language as it makes the information unavailable to most citizens and further divides the country.<br>
  I have personally found that the information on websites in other languages is often not the same as the information on the English version.<br>
  My mother&rsquo;s family came from Spain and changed their name in the US. Everyone speaks English just like the natives they all are. Many speak other languages.<br>
  Sotomeyer and others say that people from Spain, the Hispanic homeland, are NOT and CANNOT be Hispanic because we are white.<br>
More than half the family is blond and more are tawny and red headed.</p>

		<p>  Well, I support such a manuever. If they are going to be here (which they will) I would rather they follow traditional conservative guidelines within their lives.</p>

		<p>Gingrich is trying to make a comeback, but beware he is an affirmative action advocate, big government, and pro-amnesty for illegal aliens Republican in the vein of Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeb Bush, and GW Bush.  God help us if he gets the Republican nomination in 2012.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The former Speaker of the House, and all-around conservative idea-smith&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gingrich a conservative?</p>
<p>Gingrich was a very poor choice to lead the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994 as he is cut from the same cloth as Bill Clinton of whom he once stated:</p>
<p> &#8220;&hellip;I have a real problem. I melt when I&rsquo;m around him..&#8221;</p>
<p>The website &#8216;The Skeleton Closet&rsquo; reports that &#8220;both are pot smoking, draft-dodging adulterers from poor Southern families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is a summation of his character:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Newt pressed his first wife to sign divorce papers while she was still in the hospital recovering from cancer surgery. He also graciously said &#8216;She isn&rsquo;t young enough or pretty enough to be the President&rsquo;s wife.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>The hospital visit wasn&rsquo;t the end of it, either. Jackie had to take Newt to court to get him to contribute for bills, as utilities were about to be cut off&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2vdxz" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2vdxz</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all anyone needs to know about him.</p>

		<p>No surprises here, he never came off as conservative to me, only as an opportunist.  This is why the so called Republican Revolution failed because too many ignorant voters were putting neoconservatives in positions of power.  This tidal wave of brown immigration could have been stopped in the mid 90s with the right people in Congress.    </p>

		<p>A man who can not show loyalty to his wife can not possibly be loyal to his country.  Courting your new wife while still married to the old one is bad enough.  But cheating while they have cancer is the ultimate in tacky.  And he has done it twice(he is on wife three).  Low life.  just another low life.</p>

		<p>Just another reminder of why they are the Stupid Party  &mdash;  no, I didn&rsquo;t invent that label; it&rsquo;s all over the internet, for years now. </p>
<p>Yes, the Stupid Party [formerly known as &#8216;Republicans&rsquo; or &#8216;GOP]!  &mdash;  fits pretty well, doesn&rsquo;t it? What have they and their boyz Newt &amp; GWB ever done for you? </p>

		<p>Gingrich is nothing but another Council on Foreign Relations freak and should be totally ignored by the citizenry. He is a RINO anyway, proved by what he has done, not said.</p>

<p>At least the Jesse Jacksons of the world are open about what their agenda is.  I&rsquo;m tired of people eschewing the virtues of black &#8220;conservatives&#8221; like Keyes, Cosby, Watts, Powell, Rice, ad nauseum.  Everyone of them has been caught on camera engaging in an anti-White rant at point or another.  Luckily the voters can see through them.  Whether it&rsquo;s in the Deep South or Chicago his candidacy never to gain any traction with people and he&rsquo;s only with the Republicans because they feel the need to pepper their managerie with nonwhite faces.  These are just distractions on the road to White European unity. </p>

I never liked Mr. Gingrich and I never understood why conservatives were enamored by him.</p>
<p>Mr. Gingrich is an opportunist. His only interest is in himself.</p>

		<p>This clown was on TV warning Americans that the 2010 elections might be the last effort to save traditional America.  Just what is his take on traditional America?  A Tower of Babel?  Press 2 for Spanish?  Cheap alien labor? Walmarts stocked with low quality Chinese merchandise?  A foreign occupied government that will throw America under the bus to pursue it&rsquo;s own goals?  Say what you really mean Newt.  This is the last ditch effort of the neocons to maintain the status quo of post 60s America.  Without sounding like a UN speech, we know who the enemy is and we aren&rsquo;t going to be fooled by them or their surrogates anymore.</p>
