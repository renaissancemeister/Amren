<h1><a href="https://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/argentina/090810/afro-argentines-assert-identity-culture">The Reawakening of Afro-Argentine Culture</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anil Mundra, Global Post (Boston), August 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Argentina is generally considered the whitest country in South America  &mdash;  97 percent, by some counts  &mdash;  possibly more ethnically European than immigrant-saturated Europe. There was once a large Afro-Argentine presence but it has faded over the epochs. Now, for the first time in a century and a half, Argentine descendants of African slaves are organizing and going public to assert their identity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve been exiled from the collective memory of Argentina,&#8221; said Juan Suaque, a seventh-generation descendant of Argentine slaves. &#8220;It&rsquo;s as if you pass someone in the street and you have to explain your whole life, what and who you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s past midnight at the jubilant one-year anniversary party of Associacion Misibamba, the leading Afro-Argentine cultural organization of which Suaque is president. The gathered crowd practices Afro-Argentine &#8220;candombe&#8221; music and dance as they have for centuries. Women and girls of all ages gyrate the classic gesture  &mdash;  hand to hip, hand to forehead  &mdash;  encircled by the frenetic syncopation of conga drums.</p>
<p>This classic art form has been gaining in popularity in recent years, among white Argentines at least as much as black ones. Associacion Misibamba recently performed their candombe in a major feature film, a period piece set in 19th-century Buenos Aires. That period was a time  &mdash;  a distant memory just now being reawakened  &mdash;  when African expressions were an everyday part of Argentine life.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1800s, black slaves were 30 percent of the population of Buenos Aires, and an absolute majority in some other provinces. The first president of Argentina had African ancestry, and so did the composer of the first tango. Even the word &#8220;tango,&#8221; like many other words common in the Argentine vocabulary, has an African root; so do many beloved foods, including the national vices of the asado barbecue and dulce de leche.</p>
<p>The abolition of slavery was a slow process that spanned the better part of the 19th century. At the same time, under the government&rsquo;s explicit and aggressive policy of whitening the race  &mdash;  to replace &#8220;barbary&#8221; with &#8220;civilization,&#8221; in the famous phrase of the celebrated president Sarmiento  &mdash;  Afro-Argentines were inundated by European immigration, the largest such influx in the Americas outside of the United States. Blacks had dwindled to only 1.8 percent of Buenos Aires by the 1887 census, after which their category was replaced with more vague terms like &#8220;trigueno&#8221;  &mdash;  &#8220;wheaty.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2005 pilot census estimated that about 5 percent of the national population has African ancestry  &mdash;  about 2 million people. The study found that population to be worse-off by health and socioeconomic indicators than the rest of Argentina, as has presumably been the case since slavery.</p>
<p>Unlike the census of 1887, performed in a political atmosphere that was eager to efface the African presence in Argentina, this survey tried to detect any African ancestry in a household, whether or not its members appeared black. For that reason, the survey&rsquo;s architect and community activists have preferred the term &#8220;Afro-descendant&#8221; to the narrower &#8220;black.&#8221;</p>
<p>The survey was performed with help from the national census bureau and World Bank funding, at the urging of local Afro-Argentine activists who hoped to have the &#8220;Afro-descendant&#8221; category re-inserted into the Argentine census in 2010 and count themselves as a distinct segment of the populace after a century missing.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, DNA tests of blood samples in several Buenos Aires hospitals bolstered the pilot census&rsquo; result with a very similar percentage of genes traceable to Africa. Moreover, a much higher number  &mdash;  about 10 percent  &mdash;  was obtained by testing mitochondrial DNA, which traces maternal ancestry. This is consistent with the historical conjecture that many black men were lost after being sent to the frontlines of 19th-century wars, and Afro-Argentines assimilated into the white population when the remaining women mixed with the hordes of European males who had come to Argentina to work.</p>
<p>But now the census initiative seems to have stalled. There are fatal questions about its potential validity and value as a measurement tool in a society where African roots have been so long hidden. Many Argentines aren&rsquo;t aware of black ancestors they may have, and the survey&rsquo;s researchers noted the difficulty in getting people to self-identify as Afro-descendants when the label has always carried such a strong stigma.</p>
<p>The pilot census had to be preceded by aggressive public information campaigns in the sample areas, in order to sensitize households to the concept of African ancestry and give them time to research their family trees. But most agree that without such a campaign and trained researchers giving face-to-face interviews, the usual government census wouldn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the Afro-descendant population in Argentina.</p>

<p>For close to seventeen years AFRE, under the leadership of Mr. Silis Muhammad, has led the legal battle inside the United Nations to establish Human Rights and secure massive Reparations for all 250 million Afrodescendants in the western hemisphere. We include African-Americans, Afro-Mexicans, Afro-Hondurans, Haitians, Jamaicans, Afro-Cubans, Afro-Bolivians, Afro-Venezuelanas, Afro-Brazilians, Afro-Argentines and so forth. We now have our own government including an executive branch, legislative branch and judicial branch. Our first President is Ajani Mukarram. Please visit our website for more vital information.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Senator Malik Al-Arkam<br>

		<p> This sounds like a colossal scam to me. Take any country   &mdash;   usually in Latin America   &mdash;   that prides itself on its high percentage of Whiteness, and you&rsquo;ll find snide, self-interested racial liberals who search desperately for evidence that will allow them to say, &#8220;You not as White as you think, White boy.&#8221;</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t doubt that at one time the percentage of blacks was higher in Argentina than it is now   &mdash;   the same thing is true of the U.S. But I believe that suggesting one in three Buenos Aires residents was black is simply a crock. I don&rsquo;t buy that stuff about the origins of the tango and certain Argentine foods, either. It sounds to me suspiciously like the ginned-up pseudo history often manufactured for blacks in the U.S., in which everything original in the arts is alleged to have been created by blacks, then stolen by Whites.</p>
<p> Besides, view a travelogue video of Buenos Aires, and study street scenes of that great city. If you can find a single black face, I&rsquo;ll buy you a steak dinner. Plus dessert. You name the restaurant. </p>

		<p>Very oddly, no mention is made at all of the residual element of Indian blood, which I would presume is probably much greater than the African.  </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the population remains overwhelmingly white. There is no denying it.  Just too much emphasis (in this Age of Obamamania) is being placed on everything African!   Is there any sense in labeling as &#8220;Afro-descended&#8221; a person with 1% of African genes, as opposed to 99% European genes?  Does one percent outweigh ninety-nine?  </p>
<p>Sheer insanity!  Is Argentina about to join all the other white lemmings in the mad rush to suicide?</p>

		<p>Argentina, Chile and Uruguay have a black population of less than 1%. For that reason, they are the richest nations in South America and have a much brighter future than the U.S. But even though they are less than 1% blacks still cause the usual problems. In a just world, blacks would be paying reparations to the rest of us for all the rape, robbery, murder and destruction they cause wherever they go.</p>

<p>I have been in Chile a number of times and have never seen any blacks there   &mdash;   with the exception of an occasional few who were obviously visitors from the US or Brazil.</p>
<p>I once asked a Chilean woman, herself somewhat darker-skinned and with obvious Indian ancestry, about blacks in Chile. She answered me emphatically that there were NO African blacks in Chile!  Some tan mestizos, yes.  But blacks, no!</p>

		<p>I have visited the delightful city of Buenos Aires several times. To see a black face in the city is rare indeed. Perhaps that is the reason why Argentina (along with overwhelmingly white Uruguay and Chile)is among the wealthiest and most livable cities in the southern hemisphere. The most annoying and toxic aspects of &#8220;black culture&#8221; are blessedly absent in Buenos Aires. And, as an aside the women are as beautiful as found anywhere on this earth!My only regret is that I didn&rsquo;t pay more attention to my high school Spanish teacher!</p>

		<p>I find it humourous that the author of this article decries  what &#8220;diversity&#8221;, &#8220;multi-culturalism&#8221; and the other empty platitudes have done to the &#8216;Afro-Argentine&rsquo; community (rendered them socially/politically invisible, while only the &#8216;good&rsquo; features of their culture (i.e the &#8216;tango&rsquo;) are saved from obsolesence by assimilation) while - as usual - being entirely oblivious to the fact that <i>this is the <b>end-result</b> of &#8216;diversity&rsquo;</i>!</p>
<p>Mark my words: If things continue the way they are right now, those of you that live into the next 30 years will see articles about the &#8220;Reawakening of Afro-American&#8221;, or &#8220;Chinese-American&#8221;, or &#8220;Hispanic-American culture&#8221; soon enough.</p>

		<p>Anyone who has been to Argentina, as I have, can tell you that they aren&rsquo;t using a North American or European definition of &#8220;white&#8221; there.  I would estimate the percentage of people in Argentina who do not have visible non-white ancestry at more like 80% than 97%.  Most of the difference is made up by mestizos but there are also people who look like the 1/8 or 1/16th black people you find among &#8220;white&#8221; Cubans and in Portugal.  </p>

<p>Joe has a good point.  <br>
There are varying definitions of  &#8220;white&#8221;.  Anoyone in Brazil who has one drop of white blood is considered &#8220;white&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t know about Argentina, but it could well be the same. </p>
<p>But I do know that all the other Latin American countries are resentful and envious of Argentina for being so damned white. They don&rsquo;t like it.  How dare those Argentines be whiter than they!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re wrong.  The definition of white is white like anywhere in the white world whether it&rsquo;s Europe or North America.  We are descendants of Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Slovenians, Russians, Ukranians, French, Czechs, Hungarians, etc.  To say that we are not white is just kidding yourself. Have you been to Patagonia for example? Or Cordoba?  Have you been to the Oktoberfest?</p>

<p>Yes, they make that claim, but don&rsquo;t bother to back it up with any evidence  (as is usual).   These unsupported black claims to have invented everything are getting so tiresome.  They are fantasy.</p>
<p>I was wondering, for instance,  about &#8220;Dulce de Leche&#8221;, a famous Argentine candy which is made from condensed milk.  Blacks claim not to be able to digest milk.  They don&rsquo;t use it.  So then, how did that come from Africa?   Is that logical?  Naturally, that is left unexplained.  We&rsquo;re just supposed to accept their word for it.</p>
