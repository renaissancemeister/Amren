<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=110929">Feds Probe &#8216;Race-Based Discipline&rsquo; Policy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chelsea Schilling, WorldNetDaily, Sept. 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is investigating an Arizona school district&rsquo;s newly adopted racial policy that purportedly calls for a &#8220;two-tiered form of student discipline: one for black and Hispanic students; one for everyone else,&#8221; according to a newspaper columnist. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne blasted the discipline plan Wednesday, according to the Arizona Daily Star. He admitted he hadn&rsquo;t read the plan but called it &#8220;abhorrent,&#8221; warning that ethnicity should never be a consideration in disciplinary decisions. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>TUSD Superintendent Elizabeth Celania-Fagen said Horne&rsquo;s portrayal of the policy &#8220;is really not the truth.&#8221; </p>
<p>According to the report, the district is receiving dozens of angry e-mails from people across the nation. </p>
<p>The district has asked the Arizona Republic to retract the MacEachern&rsquo;s characterization of the discipline policy. </p>
<p>MacEachern recently claimed his column prompted the federal government to look into the district policy. </p>
<p>&#8220;The legal office of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights told me Tuesday that it is looking into the district&rsquo;s overly enthusiastic plan for lowering minority discipline reports, as a result of my Sunday column on the subject,&#8221; he wrote on AZ Central. </p>
<p>According to MacEachern&rsquo;s original column, the board also created an &#8220;Equity Team&#8221; to ensure &#8220;a commitment to social justice for all students.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>However, school officials have refuted MacEachern&rsquo;s description of the policy as &#8220;two-tiered&#8221; and argued that the new guidelines will only help correct racial inequalities that already exist in the system. </p>
<p>TUSD Governing Board member Adelita Grijalva told the Daily Star that MacEachern&rsquo;s column was right in one aspect: </p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, we do have a two-tiered system,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you look at children of color vs. Caucasian children, you will see that for the same kind of offenses, children of color are getting more severe consequences.&#8221; </p>
<p>The board&rsquo;s report includes statistics that while American Indian students make up only 4 percent of the student body, they account for 20 percent of the suspensions across the district. And while black students only make up 7 percent of the student body, they account for 16.3 percent of out-of-school suspensions. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>TUSD Assistant Superintendent Jim Fish told the Star that MacEachern had misunderstood what is meant by the board&rsquo;s plan to adopt a more &#8220;restorative&#8221; culture and that seeing a two-tiered system of discipline in the policy is &#8220;far-fetched.&#8221; </p>

		<p>It would depend on each incident. They say that for the identical offense the minority would get a more severe consequence but I would bet dollars to donuts that the offenses are not in any way equal. For example, if a White kid is suspended for &#8220;fighting&#8221; he was probably engaged in a scuffle with another kid of about the same size and they probably were not hurt any worse than possibly a black eye or bloody nose. If a black kid were involved in a &#8220;fight&#8221; he was probably part of a group of kids who ganged up on a smaller and younger kid who was probably beat to a pulp and required medical attention.</p>

<p>More of this nonsense.  They look at the statistics and make the claim that American Indian students are more severely penalized due to the statistics rather than the fact that American Indian students are simply getting into more trouble. We are supposed to assume that everyone is equal right nd that disparities are caused by racism right.  Well wrong.<br>

		<p>These white left wing idealogues and their left wing ethnic agenda suporting allies who were responsible for cooking this anti-white scheme up know fully well that the difference in these disciplinary statistics are due to a difference in the amount of trouble different groups get into and not some sort of imagined &#8220;racism&#8221; in the disciplinary process. I used to be a lefty believe it or not and one thing I began understanding before I made my transition was that the left wing certainly holds no premium on honesty.  They really do lie for their causes.  Flat out lie with malicious intent.    </p>

		<p>This very policy is EXACTLY what Jesse and Al have been pushing for years, and the reason for it is because blacks are being expelled from school at a pretty good rate, while others are dropping out more easily after being suspended for misbehavior for a few days.</p>
<p>Wanting to keep a kid in school and undisciplined can only be a goal of ignorant blacks.  Only they are unable to see the folly of such a policy.  This is just one more example that explains why blacks cannot create any workable societies that are on any level of civility and efficiency.</p>
<p>We are cursed with taking care of these people, because they&rsquo;re completely incapable of caring for themselves.</p>

<p>Somehow I doubt very, very much that that is true.  I&rsquo;m sure the reality is that children of color get punished more often, and Adelita Grijalva takes it as an article of faith that those children of color don&rsquo;t actually cause trouble more frequently than the white children do, when of course they do.<br>

		<p>Based on this school board&rsquo;s rationale, racially-based criminal penalties should become the law of the land.  Apparently they believe that the hugely greater levels of criminality among blacks and Hispanics as compared to other races is an illusion borne of selective enforcement.</p>
<p>Perhaps every member of this collectively deranged school administration should be forced to stroll (unarmed and unescorted) through the black and Hispanic neighborhoods of any large American city. I daresay the survivors would gain new insights on the true levels of black and Hispanic violent crime.</p>

		<p>Now that I remember it, my old high school had a discriminatory two-tiered system too. Although probably due to ignorance, the principal would suspend the boys more than the girls. I hope Tucson plans on correcting this imbalance as well.</p>

		<p>For those of you who do not know  TUSD Governing Board member Adelita Grijalva is the lovely offspring of known mechista and anti white chicano activist and congressman Raul Grijalva from Arizona&rsquo;s 7th district. He is rabidly anti white and it looks like the apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree.</p>

		<p>What a joke.  The feds and the groups the feds support like ACLU, NAACP etc are behind this.  ACLU gets its fees paid by the unfortunate government agencies it sues on behalf of black criminals. Federal Judges have found and ordered according to NAACP directives for almost 60 years since Brown vs Topeka and through affirmative action, school discipline and the Judicially enabled and abetted destruction of entire cities by black crime.</p>
<p>The Judiciary is nothing more a collection of ACLU NAACP LARAZA MALDEF ADL AJC $PLC NOW Ford Foundation puppets.  The Judges are like those 5 year old child Kings in medieval and early modern times, just little figureheads in fancy robes while their advisors ran the show.</p>
<p>At least those 5 year old Kings grew up.  So the advisor&rsquo;s reigns was only 10 to 15 years.  But the Judges are in for life and unable to deviate from ACLU NAACP LARAZA etc orders. The civil rights division of the DOJ is nothing more than a collection of liberals who hate Whites with a passion and want us all dead as soon as possible.  Until we are exterminated, the DOJ wants to make our lives as horrible as possible including forcing our children to endure 12 years of the Lord of the Flies atmosphere of our black and brown schools.</p>
<p>That prepares our children for their future as helots and victims of black on white crime and federally mandadated employment discrimination.</p>
<p>This is nothing more than the de jure recognition of the de facto racially discriminatory discipline against Whites that has been going on for 40 years.  Federal judges have mandated this kind of bi-racial discipline system for years.  Judges have also terrorized the school districts against disciplining the most vicious of blacks.  Anyone who has been so unfortunate as to have gone to school with blacks knows this.  Whites who resist being robbed by blacks are suspended while the blacks merrily go on their way robbing and extorting money from the Whites.</p>

		<p>My own perception of this is that the colored kids, black and Mexican, mature at an earlier age than the white kids, and mature more so when they do.</p>
<p>Black kids by the time they are fourteen or so have the bodies of grown adults while white kids are just starting to mature.</p>
<p>When a fight occurs, the white kid is at a severe disadvantage. The white kid is injured more and injured worse when when a fight occurs</p>
<p>And too, the incidents of black and Mexican kids fighting result in more significant and worse injuries for more trivial reason, maybe for no reason.</p>
<p>The overly optimistic plan is just plain goofy. And maybe is illegal too? SPLC needs to look into this on behalf of the white kids.</p>

		<p>Has anyone ever considered the fact that non-white kids are suspended more frequently than whites because they are more likely to misbehave? Granted, it is not my contention that white kids are these perfect angels. I myself have known white kids who do drugs and underachieve academically. I also know that a white kid is more likely to be a &#8220;school shooter&#8221; than a black kid (the reason why I have school shooter in quotation marks is because black kids in the hood shoot kids up in the vicinity of inner city schools quite frequently). However, the average black student is much more rude, belligerent, and hostile than the average white, Asian, or even Hispanic student. Based on my personal experience, many black kids are just looking for a fight, eagerly accosting vulnerable white students (I was one of those vulnerable white students) and daring them to talk back. Though this may upset some of the bloggers here, I do believe that whites can live in harmony with Asians even Latinos. Blacks, on the other hand, are incompatible with white society and western civilization. In addition to separate discipline, we should institute separate schools for whites and blacks. Only the complete separation of the groups will foster the &#8220;harmony&#8221; so many idealistic liberals seek.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not &#8216;Malicious&rsquo; beating down the white man. At least the kids don&rsquo;t think so. In fact they are angry about it. And notice the authorities never target the bad behavior only the evil society (which means white folks somewhere).</p>

		<p><i>He said he&rsquo;s particularly concerned about how the policy would play out in practice.<br>
&#8220;When you issue a decree that we want to reduce the discipline of minority students, you&rsquo;re sending a message to teachers that if they have a student who is misbehaving and who is in a protected class, then they need to treat that student more leniently.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right. There is no way to get the discipline and expulsion rates of Blacks and Whites to be the same except by suicidal leniency to the black delinquents. All that we can hope for is equal penalties for the same sort of offenses.</p>
<p>Better would be to discipline blacks (or any special problem group) more severely than others to force them to behave by deterrence until something close to equal rates by race of misbehavior is achieved, but of course, in our pc times this sensible idea won&rsquo;t be allowed.</p>

		<p>The above story is just more proof that Americans who are raising school aged children should be withdrawing them from public schools, en masse, and as soon as possible. On so many levels, public schools are an absolute disgrace. The three R&rsquo;s can be adequately taught by most parents, along with basic computer skills. These subjects would provide kids a foundation for anything else they want to pursue, in a safe, friendly and &#8220;toxic liberal loony&#8221; free environment. </p>
