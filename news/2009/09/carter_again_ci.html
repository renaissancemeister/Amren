<h1>Carter Again Cites Racism as Factor in Obama&rsquo;s Treatment</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, Sept. 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former President Jimmy Carter reiterated Wednesday that he believes racism is an issue for President Obama in trying to lead the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a radical fringe element of demonstrators and others begin to attack the president of the United States as an animal or as a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler or when they wave signs in the air that said we should have buried Obama with Kennedy, those kinds of things are beyond the bounds,&#8221; the Democrat who served from 1977-1981 told students at Emory University.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people who are guilty of that kind of personal attack against Obama have been influenced to a major degree by a belief that he should not be president because he happens to be African American.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a racist attitude, and my hope is and my expectation is that in the future both Democratic leaders and Republican leaders will take the initiative in condemning that kind of unprecedented attack on the president of the United States,&#8221; Carter said.</p>
<p>Carter&rsquo;s comments came a day after he said racial politics played a role in South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson&rsquo;s outburst during Obama&rsquo;s speech to Congress last week and in some of the opposition the president has faced since taking office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michael Steele, the first African-American to chair the Republican National Committee, denied Wednesday that race is fueling protests.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Carter is flat-out wrong,&#8221; Steele said in a statement. &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t about race. It is about policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Actor and comedian Bill Cosby, who is black, said Wednesday in a written statement that he agrees with Carter.</p>
<p>&#8220;During President Obama&rsquo;s speech on the status of health care reform, some members of Congress engaged in a public display of disrespect,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;While one representative hurled the now infamous &#8216;you lie&rsquo; insult at the president, others made their lack of interest known by exhibiting rude behavior such as deliberately yawning and sending text messages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carter&rsquo;s comments on racism came during his 28th annual town hall meeting at Emory, where he has been a professor since 1982. He spoke an a variety of issues.</p>

		<p>Jimmy Carter is probably right that race is going to be a bigger and bigger factor.</p>
<p>In this case I think Obama was lying about the illegals and free health care and it was correct for the lie to be exposed in a highly public forum.</p>
<p>Obama will get respect when he earns respect.</p>
<p>Appointing blacks, hispanics and other cronies like the wise latina to high office will not gain him respect.  He is showing his true colors.</p>
<p>Michael Steele is the death of the republican party.</p>
<p>It is high time that white people become as racist as blacks have been for many years.</p>
<p>We have been bending over for far too long.</p>

		<p>You know what?</p>
<p>For a long time, I have wondered about &ldquo;good&rdquo; old Comrade Jimmy, but now I am more convinced than ever; he probably didn&rsquo;t live in a mostly black area of Plains Georgia growing up, simply because he and his family were white &ldquo;saints.&rdquo; He probably was there for a reason owing more to his rather unusual facial features, that despite the pigment of his skin and eye color, betray his not so &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; pro-miscegenation agendas once in the White House and his abominable dysgenic antics now. </p>
<p>Obama, the &ldquo;first&rdquo; black president?</p>
<p>I think not!</p>

		<p>   Jimmy Carter is an embarrassment to this country. He is an old fool that never accomplished anything worthwhile.  He was instrumental in the downfall of South Africa and Rhodesia. How much more damage can he do before he finally dies? He must be trying to beat Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s record for failure. </p>

<p>Slight correction.  Carter was responsible for ruining Rhodesia, but it was Reagan/Nut Gingrich that destroyed South Africa.  This leads to some interesting hypocrisy on the part of some conservative talking heads.  They denounce Mugabe, ZIM and Jimmy Carter (rightly so), but then fail to say that their Great Hero did the same thing to South Africa, which of course is in just about as bad a shape as ZIM, but the conservative talking heads don&rsquo;t tell you that, either.</p>

<p>It took me a moment to realize that you were referencing Carter here and not Obama, because that is precisely why this repetitious &#8220;racist&#8221; drum is being constantly beat: Obama&rsquo;s presidency, only into its first 9 months, is an abject failure. Rather than shed light on that painful truth, clownish relics like Carter and the anti-White Marxist media will carp about &#8220;racism&#8221; as either being the reason for it, or to provide diversionary cover.</p>
<p>With a little over three more years of this nonsense to go, the race hustlers are going to need a new race card. This one has been so over used and abused that the magnetic strip no longer registers and neither the signature nor the numbers can be read.</p>

		<p>Such an excellent example of why multiracial societies are absolute disasters.</p>
<p>Nothing gets done, because a black faction can&rsquo;t compete and can only acquire accomplishment by screaming racism and causing constant turmoil.</p>
<p>And, all the while the incompetents are given more and more positions and privileges, which only prompts them to cry even more.</p>
<p>Blacks are dumb, but whites are absolute fools.</p>
<p>With the exception of the ones trying to fight it all, plus the town hallers and tea partiers who aren&rsquo;t all we need to fight racism, but by God it&rsquo;s a start.</p>

		<p>As always, Carter is flat out wrong.  The difference these days is that we might be able to blame it on senility.</p>
<p>The people complaining about Obama aren&rsquo;t doing so because they don&rsquo;t think a black man can make a good leader.  The alleged &#8220;racist&#8221; element in the protests isn&rsquo;t based on hatred or denigration (an apt word in this case!) of African-Americans, but rather on FEAR of African-Americans.</p>
<p>They fear that Obama will do things with the welfare of his fellow African-Americans first and foremost in his mind   &mdash;   and the new health care scheme is the first step in that direction.</p>
<p>Even if Carter had been exactly right (and he never has been, and never will be), it&rsquo;s totally irresponsible for him to be saying the things he&rsquo;s saying and rile everyone up on both sides.  Does he want the country to break apart?  He should be thinking of ways to bring people together, but anything positive like that is totally beyond his abilities.</p>

My business mentor once told me that the higher up you go on the corporate or political ladder, the less likely you are to get patted on the back for doing a good job, but the more likely you are to get torn apart for anything even remotely resembling a mistake.</p>
<p>Prince Charles lost major public favor, and his mistress Camilla was pelted with bread rolls at the grocery store, on account of their affair. Napoleon was exiled and died a lonely death. Pete Rose paid the price for gambling. What did all these famous and punished people have in common? They were/are all white!</p>
<p>When whites face public condemnation and accusations, they sometimes collapse under the pressure, but they never blame their skin color for their treatment by others. They know that if they can&rsquo;t stand the heat, they&rsquo;d better get out of the kitchen. CEOs and white politicians need thick skins to survive.</p>
<p>Obama isn&rsquo;t undergoing any litmus test that former white presidents haven&rsquo;t faced. The only difference is that liberals and blacks feel he shouldn&rsquo;t have to. If he can&rsquo;t withstand the pressure, then he isn&rsquo;t fit to lead the United States.<br>

		<p>Po&rsquo; ol&rsquo; Jimmmuh Cottuh, certainly the most embarrassingly ridiculous man ever to be elected president in this (and perhaps any other) country.  Known to his enlisted shipmates in the Navy as Ensign Doody, due his remarkable resemblance to Howdy Doody, his performance as chief political executive of this nation was so slapstick that even the normally left-leaning comedic industry piled on.  As events spun out of control on his watch, with the Russians invading Afghanistan, the Iranians seizing our embassy in Tehran, inflation running at 14%, prime rate at 18%, gold hitting $800/oz (about $2,400 in today&rsquo;s dollars), the rescue effort for the Iran hostages ending in fiery disaster, Jimmuh&rsquo;s only response was, &#8220;I guess the &#8216;murrican people jus&rsquo; gonna have to git used to a lower standard o&rsquo; livin&rsquo;&#8221;.</p>
<p>This lip-bibbling ninny could have learned something from his highly successful successor, who left office quietly and eschewed any further involvement in national politics or policy.</p>
<p>Carter was, and seems to determined to remain, an ageless buffoon and a continuing national embarrassment.</p>

		<p>What I find ridiculous in this case is Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s trying to play the role of &#8220;elder statesman&#8221;, as though we&rsquo;re impressed with him now because of his legacy as such a fine president. (I&rsquo;m trying to suppress laughter even as I type this).  Carter is a legend in his own mind.  I&rsquo;m certain that many of you know more than I do about some of the following events and the other &#8220;players&#8221; involved over a period of years, but isn&rsquo;t Jimmy the one who:</p>
<p>1.  Sold out Nationalist China (Taiwan)<br>
2.  Gave away the Panama Canal<br>
3.  Sold out the Shah of Iran, which resulted in the takeover by the nutcase Khomeini, the prelude to the Iran of today</p>
<p>Sure, we can debate the lease on the canal and maybe we weren&rsquo;t too supportive of Taiwan before Carter&rsquo;s administration, etc., etc., but don&rsquo;t you think Teddy Roosevelt really wanted us to control the canal for more than 99 years?  Are we comfortable with the canal being more subject than ever to a bunch of Central Americans?</p>
<p>And wasn&rsquo;t there something about this illustrious former president&rsquo;s granting amnesty to the draft dodgers of the Vietnam era?  <br>

		<p>In one way I suppose it&rsquo;s good that Obama got elected because it shifts the title of &#8220;Worst President Ever&#8221; away from Carter.  I remember how impotent he came across in 1979 during the Iranian hostage crisis.  We had out of control inflation and unemployment in the double digits.  His only saving grace was his unbiased Middle East policy unlike today.  Ronald Reagan swept almost every state in the 1980 elections.  The mood in this country is ripe for another conservative revolution (a real one this time).  Now that America has elected a far left Marxist it&rsquo;s time to swing the pendulum back the other way to the extreme hard right, something this country has never done, and take back our nation. </p>

		<p>Jimmy Carter is a traitor. He was the one who opened the door to Chinese LEGAL IMMIGRANT scab labor. This resulted in thousands of Native Born White American Male Engineers-many of them vetrans -being robbed of their jobs and ages by LEGAL IMMIGRANT CHINESE. MY late father was one of these men. He complained bitterly about what Carter had done right up to two weeks before he died.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter has aiding and abeting the asian &#8220;americans &#8221; in their vicious race war against Native Born White Americans which in addition to massive job loss is bringing about the massive destruction of who knows how many centuries of collective Native Born White American engineering-future generations included. I suppose WE shouldn&rsquo;t be too shocked by this considering that the Carter family has for several centuries been in the business of exploiting labor.</p>

Our founding fathers (now discredited as racists) deeply mistrusted government. This is un-American and reminds me of the former Soviet Union.<br>

		<p>I recall an incident when Jimmy was president.  A black man tried to create an incident by trying to attend a service at the church where Jimmy&rsquo;s mother, Miss Lillian, worshiped.  Miss Lillian was interviewed by the press and she stazted that &#8220;Somebody ought to shoot that n-word&#8221;.  It appears that Jimmy had some experience with racism in the south.</p>

		<p>I think statements like this are actually hurting the Democrats.  The more that the conversation is about race the less that will get done in the senate.  The race discussion could grind Obama&rsquo;s administration to a halt as more and more white Americans feel disenfranchised with the Democratic Party.  </p>
