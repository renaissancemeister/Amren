			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gregorya Patterson, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), September 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Math and Science Academy in Woodbury has become known as a successful charter school that serves up a specific curriculum to students with a technical bent since opening at the beginning of this decade. In Eden Prairie, Eagle Ridge Academy is developing a reputation for its classical education, and in Bloomington, Beacon Preparatory School is trying to do the same thing.</p>
<p>In addition to being charter schools with specific missions, these institutions share another trait: They are in suburbs, far from the urban educational turmoil that charter schools were, in part, designed to solve. Their students are predominantly white, and their test scores above average.</p>
<p>Initially, charter schools were intended to boost education in troubled urban schools, giving their students more choice and more innovative teaching methods. They have helped in many cases. But an unintended result has brought more choice to many suburban areas, which already had comparatively good schools.</p>
<p>Now, there are more charter schools in the metro-area suburbs than in either Minneapolis or St. Paul. Educators and policymakers agree that the rise of suburban charter schools has been surprising, but they disagree over whether it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A school of their own</b></p>
<p>&#8220;The growth of charter schools in the suburbs is a pretty interesting trend we&rsquo;ve seen in the last six years,&#8221; said Morgan Brown, assistant commissioner at the state&rsquo;s Department of Education, who is in charge of school choice.</p>
<p>While the department hasn&rsquo;t studied the trend closely, Brown said suburbanites are interested in charter schools because some public school districts where they reside don&rsquo;t offer as many choices as even the public schools in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where residents can choose from a hodgepodge of magnet programs, and more private schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moreover, charter schools increase segregation in both city and suburb, harming chances of low-income students to get a better education, said Myron Orfield, executive director of the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s Institute on Race and Poverty.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;White flight&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Advertisement Calling suburban charter schools a version of &#8220;white flight,&#8221; Orfield said many of the suburban charter schools tend to have even fewer students of color than the public school districts in which they are located. Others who have criticized charter school outcomes say they are less certain about the role of race.</p>
<p>When charter schools manage to help students reach high academic standards, they also should be called upon to help low-income and minority students do the same by bringing more of them into their student body, said state Sen. Kathy Saltzman, DFL- Woodbury.</p>
<p>That is because charter schools are publicly funded and get significant startup money as well. Other states, including Illinois and Missouri, have greater restrictions on where charter schools may be located. Illinois has few outside Chicago, and Missouri allows them only in St. Louis and Kansas City. Such strategies may be worthy of consideration in Minnesota, Saltzman said.</p>

		<p>The contrived thinking that has led us to say that just because something has public money it should hold itself hostage to forced integration no matter what the schools mandate is. </p>
<p>After all public money mostly means white taxpayers and whose rights are being violated. If we hadn&rsquo;t ruined public schools in the first place Magnet Schools would be a moot point. </p>

		<p>&#8220;White flight&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;White Fight&#8221;&hellip;see yesterday`s school bus story&hellip;Which got me to thinking. My own sainted father was a blockbuster. I  didn`t realize till age fifty that he was wrong and the &#8220;hateful&#8221; neighbor was right so many years ago. I never thought about the issue much less called him on it. I wonder how many victims of diversity and magnet schools tell their parents after a beating, &#8220;If you love em so much, then YOU go to school with em.&#8221; People on here speculate all the time about parents disowning the children for dating outside their race etc. I wonder how many kids have given an ultimatum to thier parents to quit offering them as sacrifical lambs to salve their own conscience. </p>

		<p>I think the real problem may have to do with dioxyribose nucleic acid. Blacks just don&rsquo;t have the grey matter to make it - and of course, their culture, such as it is, doesn&rsquo;t help them any.</p>
<p>Charter schools are privately operated. Given that the purpose of a private manager is to make a profit for shareholders (at least in the fully private sector this is the case), it makes sense to me that a charter school will choose to open in an area where it can make a good return on its investment - in this case, producing successful students.</p>
<p>And just where are the successful students? Why, in the white- and Asian-dominated suburbs, of course.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the only angle. Parents also want successful outcomes for their children. So why would they squander their children&rsquo;s futures as guinea pigs for the Marxist social engineers in some crime-ridden inner-city ghetto &#8220;school&#8221;, where their children are going to be harassed, threatened, assaulted, attacked and raped, and most certainly aren&rsquo;t going to be able to devote themselves to the subjects they&rsquo;re supposed to be studying? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a better and wiser investment to place them in a safe environment, with others of their own kind, where they can prepare for positions of leadership in society?</p>

		<p>The last sentence is correct about Missouri.  That MO only allows charters in St. Louis and Kansas City tells you to whom they are pandering.  The Missouri Constitution prohibits different state laws for different jurisdictions simply on the basis of their being a different jurisdiction, so this law is unconstitutional.  Except you won&rsquo;t find a Missouri state judge that&rsquo;ll say so, the Democrats love blacks and the Republicans are black panderers.  </p>
<p>But they say success is the best revenge.  Sometimes failure is the best revenge.  St. Louis&rsquo;s charter school students&rsquo; test scores are worse than St. Louis City&rsquo;s public system.</p>

		<p>I believe it&rsquo;s a good time to dismantle the Marxist Public Education Gulag and free the minds of our children and young people. </p>
<p>I support a school voucher system that lets every parent take the money spent on public education as a voucher and spend it wherever they like. Private schools, church schools, home schooling competing directly for those funds with public schools.</p>
<p>The sell off of the public schools would bring in a lot of revenue and the better education would pay positive dividends down the line. <br>

		<p>Too white and too successful, so we can&rsquo;t have that, oh no God forbid. We have to dumb those white kids down so as not to hurt the self-esteem of the black kids. Or bus the black kids in so they can start assaulting the white kids on the bus and show them the error of their white priviledged, racist ways.</p>

		<p>I must be stupid or something, I just don&rsquo;t get it. Charter schools were established because de-segregation, busing and the attendant ills brought the public schools to such a low standard that they became little else but holding tanks for delinquents. Now that charter schools have proven to work they want to do the same things to the charter schools that they done the public schools. Only one question. What is planned for round three?</p>

		<p>sorry for no cap&rsquo;s or certain punctuation. my keyboard is bad.</p>
<p>this is a predictable occurance. i&rsquo;ll be you dollars to donuts kathy saltzman either doesn&rsquo;t have children or refuses to send her children to a majority-black school..just like all our presidents. no d.c. public schools for them.<br>
hypocrisy again, plain and simple.</p>
<p>as a batchelor, i used to live in an all-white neighborhood that was laid out in shreveport, la. in the 1950&rsquo;s. it was quiet, middle-class and very traditionally mid-century style with charming architechture and always well-maintained with manicured lawns and that ever present &#8221;fresh-painted&#8221; look. white women walked and jogged alone at night and the area enjoyed the one of the lowest crime in shreveport, according to police reports. my neighbor&rsquo;s children used to lean their bicycles against the side of their parents house without fear of them being stolen. this neighborhood hadn&rsquo;t really changed in terms of demographics - or crime - since the wonderful &#8216;50&rsquo;s. in the 1950&rsquo;s white people were in control of their own destinies, were in control of who they lived next door to and where they sent their children to school.</p>
<p>thurgood marshall and white liberals took care of that. marshall was the very light-skinned first black supreme court justice who was responsible for the &#8221;brown vs. the board of education&#8221; in 1954. white resistance to this decision was so strong that it wasn&rsquo;t really enacted until kennedy got behind it in the early 60&rsquo;s. the very liberal texan vice-president johnson carried the torch long enough for whites to integrate&hellip;kicking and screaming. not literally, of course, but with years of demonstrations to no avail.<br>
white parents knew intinctively - and they were correct - that integration would spell the end of public schools in america.</p>
<p>getting back to shreveport and my old neighborhood. i used to work nights and every morning during school season i would witness schoolbus after schoolbus full of black children being driven into my neighborhood from black neighborhoods. i was told by a neighbor and my sister - who is a teacher - that these black parents were taking advantage of a piece of liberal legislation called &#8221;m and m&#8221;, standing for majority/minority. this bill was passed a few years ago by liberal politicians in order to achieve more integration in the public school system. simply put, it states that if your child goes to a school in which he or she is the majority race, then he qualifies to be bussed to a school in which he or she is a minority. it&rsquo;s not hard to figure out what race it benefits. </p>
<p>charter schools were established in the suburbs to achieve a public school parents could send their children to that wasn&rsquo;t overwhelmingly black. now the powers that be want to take that away. soon there won&rsquo;t be anywhere for white children to go without fear of being beat up - as we witnessed on a recent youtube video at belleville west h.s. in a st. louis suburb, formally all-white - to achieve a descent education&hellip;to a school that hasn&rsquo;t been dumbed down so all the blacks can pass. i see more and more home schooling being done in the future and very expensive private schools springing up that won&rsquo;t accept &#8221;vouchers&#8221; from black children going to that school on the taxpayer&rsquo;s dime. </p>

Hmmm&hellip; Seems to me such charter schools enhance chances of white students to get a better education than they&rsquo;d otherwise get wasting their time in an educational environment destroyed by disruptive blacks.</p>
<p>These Institute on Race and Poverty types don&rsquo;t seem to understand: SOMEBODY in this country&rsquo;s gotta get educated and live a productive life if blacks hope to keep receiving a steady supply of food stamps, welfare checks, Section 8 housing, etc.</p>

<p>THIS is where the problem is  &mdash;  White-hating, hostile elites in &#8216;elected&rsquo; positions who send their own children to exclusive private schools and then hypocritically pontificate to Whites that they &#8216;should be called upon&hellip;to help minority students by bringing them into their student body.&rsquo; </p>
<p>These marxist elected officials won&rsquo;t hesitate to instantly scream &#8216;racist&rsquo; at any White that objects to being &#8216;called upon&rsquo; to have his children&rsquo;s school destroyed by violent blacks.</p>
<p>All the complaining in the world means nothing until and unless these jerks are voted out of office and replaced by officials that represent White interests.  One does not put his career and reputation on the line by voting as he does by &#8216;speaking out&rsquo;, which Whites do at great risk. </p>
<p>Whites that object to their precious children attending school with violent, bused-in blacks need to target these idiot politicians and fund and run opposition candidates that will uphold their wishes.  </p>
<p>Do it before it becomes impossible as it is in California.</p>

		<p>How dare those white people bail out of the inner cities and form schools that are successful. Both my wife and I attended schools that were reasonably decent many years ago, but have since been taken over and are utter failures now. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for a high school from Gary (or most of the areas of NW Indiana outside of Munster, Chesterton, or Valparaiso) to win the state championships in Chess, academic bowl, or anything that requires mental prowess. Now, if high schools were allowed to have shooting teams, Gary might do quite well. </p>
<p>There are a fair number of charter schools in Gary itself, more than likely these serve those kids whose parents actually give a hoot about the child. However, a state representative from Gary is trying to introduce a bill to limit the number of charter schools in the area. God forbid that the kids who are capable of doing something can escape the schools in Gary, Indiana. </p>
<p>When charter schools manage to help students reach high academic standards, they also should be called upon to help low-income and minority students do the same by bringing more of them into their student body, said state Sen. Kathy Saltzman, DFL- Woodbury.</p>
<p>Just a quick check of Woodbury, MN on wikipedia and it looks like a lovely community that is full of successful people. My guess is that it is full of bleeding heart liberals of Scandinavian ancestry. Just the kind of community that the elites wish to obliterate. I cannot for the life of me understand why when you live in an upscale area, you want to bring in those who would destroy it. Come visit lovely Gary, Indiana and see your future if you move forward with this idiocy. Just pick the entire community up an set them down on farmland in Minnesota and watch the dysfunction up close and personal.  </p>

		<p>In and around Atlanta, schools are issuing &#8216;vouchers&rsquo; to allow any child to attend any charter school because of such statistics. Thus, the parents who put their children in charter schools to avoid the dumbing down of integration are having to outrun the minorities. It&rsquo;s become a game of chase, and hide &amp; seek, with affluent and/or aware parents trying to stay one step ahead of the diversity police.</p>

		<p>Somewhat OT but here&rsquo;s an interesting factoid about those two young people who pulled off the ACORN sting. They were home schooled. I wasn&rsquo;t at all surprised. Normally, people don&rsquo;t shake off the effects of public school indoctrination until they are middle aged, if ever. Also, home schooled people seem absolutely bizarre in being so well-spoken and confident. Even the best schools tend to beat a kid down, making him timid and inexpressive.</p>

		<p>I want my children to go to a school that is all White. No blacks, not even any Asians. I want them to learn about European history and why it is important that they preserve their bloodlines. I am getting fed up with White Nationalists that are sympathetic to Asians to the point of breeding with them. In 50 years we want this country to have a sizable and healthy White gene pool, rather than a country of mulattos and Eurasians, which appears to be the way it&rsquo;s headed. I am willing to sacrifice a lot to achieve this goal. </p>

<p>&gt; I&rsquo;m sorry, Mrs. Cleaver did not jog. This sentence fragment rather exposes your statement as a fraud.  I grew up in the 50s, no one jogged in neighborhoods during the night or day, and especially not white women.  If anything, they played tennis in the morning hours with a similarly privileged upper class housewife.  Only high school and colleges were concerned with physical fitness in their athletes.  Physical fitness was not a national concern in the 50s, let along a fad.  It wasn&rsquo;t until the early 60s that JFK made general American physical fitness a national concern.  He had a campaign that promoted 50 mile hikes.  Boy Scout troops began to do them and soon many other groups started to take part.  Up until Kennedy, Eisenhower had only focused on studies of fitness of American youth compared to Europeans and youth in the military.  </p>
<p>The remainder of your statement may have been true about your town, but there were plenty of gritty places in the 1950s.  Every city of any size had a Skid Row before Urban Renewal Projects started in the mid-1960s and lots of men still rode the rails.</p>

<p>I have a dear old relative in the region who I speak with fairly often.  She is a typical Northern European Christian inspired, Humphrey type liberal.

<p>What Mr. Andrews related about the subdivision he resided in was that it was <i>laid out</i> in the 1950&rsquo;s. He did not say when he lived there-only that the neighborhood was originally built back in the day of Ward and June.</p>

<p>There have been a few charter schools here in Buffalo. Most (if not all) have been shut down because of poor performance. -</p>
<p>The term &#8220;charter school&#8221; means different things in various parts of the country. In Buffalo, was it used to describe schools set up for minorities or was it used to describe schools set up by whites that just couldn&rsquo;t get enough funding to get the job done?<br>
