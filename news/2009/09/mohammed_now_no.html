<h1><a href="https://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benleapman/100010043/mohammed-now-no1-baby-boys-name-in-london/">Mohammed Now No.1 Baby Boys&rsquo; Name in London</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Leapman, London Telegraph, September 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Telegraph.co.uk today reports that Mohammed has become the most common name for baby boys born in London and in three other English regions.</p>
<p>In the capital, the Islamic name  &mdash;  including its varient spellings  &mdash;  was twice as popular as the second-placed name, Daniel, in 2008.</p>
<p>For those who follow these things, this won&rsquo;t come as a huge surprise. We know that the UK&rsquo;s Muslim population is growing, both through immigration and through its higher birthrate. We know that there are particular concentrations in London, the West Midlands and the North of England. We know that Muslim families tend to choose one particular name for their baby boys  &mdash;  Mohammed  &mdash;  a way that other communities do not.</p>
<p>And last week it was reported that the name was now the third most popular in England as a whole. In fact, Mohammed probably rose to the number one slot in the capital some time ago. For several years, I have been trying to pin this down as a fact. But until now, it has proved impossible because for the past decade or so, the Office for National Statistics has not disclosed regional breakdowns of popular baby names, only national totals. My requests for the regional figures were met with the response that this would be impossible to provide, even under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>Now that the ONS has somehow managed to produce regional figures after all, we can see that Mohammed is number one in London, West Mids, North West and Yorkshire/Humberside. Yet you wouldn&rsquo;t know it from a cursory glance at the ONS press release, issued on Sept 8, which states that Mohammed is &#8220;number three in London&#8221;.</p>
<p>That is because the ONS does not take varient spellings into account. Fair enough. But in this case, the number-crunchers were being literal to the point of being obtuse. Some will suspect that they were motivated by a well-meaning attempt to avoid interpeting their own findings in a way which would prove controversial. Some would call this political correctness.</p>
<p>Even before today&rsquo;s revelation of the regional findings, Max Hastings accused the ONS of a &#8220;shabby effort to conceal&#8221; the fact that Mohammed is the third-most-popular name England-wide.</p>
<p>The fact that it has taken a week from the publication of the figures for the full story to emerge will surely reinforce this view in the mind of many people who are already sceptical of Government statistics.<br>

		<p>Just think about what this means for the future education of British kids. Will western kids ever learn the truth about Mohammed as they do about Hitler? Mohammed did several horrible things that should be taught when our kids are learning about major historical figures. But because he is also a religious figure to Muslims, we must omit the truth in our schools. It is not western kids fault that Jesus can stand as a good religious figure and a good historical figure. </p>

		<p>Mohammed the most popular name given to boys   &mdash;   in London!  Who could imagine this?  It&rsquo;s so sad to see a great country go down like this - and with virtually no resistance.  A country whose White population is so morally disarmed that they can&rsquo;t even put up a fight, either physically or otherwise.  A country with almost 5 MILLION cameras watching their own citizens.  And all they have to do is close their borders and deport these illegals.  The media has their entire population in a state of fear of being called the dreaded word - &#8216;racist&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s so incredibly pathetic that it defies belief.</p>

		<p>The muslims are in the UK at the invitation of the white marxists.  The only good thing is that when the anglostan caliphate is installed, the perverse marxists will be the first ones to be beheaded.  Muslims are not kind to drunken homosexuals who encourage pornography, atheism, and out of wedlock births.</p>

		<p>Well, this is the rot that the feminist movement has wrought.</p>
<p>While the muslims still have a nuclear family and the mother still bears children, the native Britons do not because this is now considered &#8220;oppressive&#8221; to Anglo womyn. While the muslims are still very religious, the native Britons are not because Christianity says that womyn should &#8220;obey&#8221; and &#8220;submit&#8221; to their husband (while husbands should simply &#8220;love&#8221; their wife). This goes against the feminist notion of &#8220;gender equality&#8221; and, thus, Christianity must go. I guess the &#8220;love&#8221; of a husband is just not good enough anymore.</p>
<p>This explains why the most popular boy name is now &#8220;Mohammed&#8221; in the UK and three other countries. It will only become more exponential from here on out. At my workplace here in America there are eight White womyn in my office, all between the ages of 30 and 49, and <b>none</b> of them have any children. In fact, I&rsquo;ve heard a couple of them talk in disdain of having children. Their dogs are their &#8220;babies&#8221;. I&rsquo;m sure this is not an atypical situation these days. So, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before this happens here too.</p>
<p>The <b>only</b> good thing to come out of this is that there will be no future generation to carry on the &#8220;feminist agenda&#8221;, simply <b>because</b> of its suicidal nature. However, this will come at a very large price, the extinction of all Whites. They will have met their goals of 40 years ago, but won&rsquo;t be around to celebrate it.</p>

<p>I guess it is fitting that the UK was the birthplace of George Orwell. Ironic also that there most popular tv show would be titled Big Brother.</p>

		<p>The brave and brilliant British!</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t be conquered from without, <br>
so they were conquered by stealth from within.</p>
<p>How enormously sad!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, &#8220;Mustn&rsquo;t outrage the muslims&#8221; and the Brits are taking it literally. Genocide/religicide and scorched earth WILL work! can we make religicide a real word now like they did &#8220;ethnicity&#8221;??</p>

		<p>Mohamed is also a popular name in the four largest cities in The Netherlands. I&rsquo;d expect it to take the number one spot in Paris as well. I love how a society where everyone is named &#8220;Mohamed&#8221; is considered &#8220;diverse.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The sun is definitely setting on the British empire. They might as well add a crescent to the Union Jack and throw in the towel. Why on earth did they self-destruct in the name of political correctness? They are willingly surrendering their proud white heritage and culture to alien third-world invaders. That stiff upper lip won&rsquo;t save them now.<br>
America will be next unless whites wake up quickly&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not over yet for the real British!  At least they have a party looking out for their interests (the BNP), unlike we native White Americans!  We can&rsquo;t have a political party that protects White Americans from marginalization because that would be &#8220;racist,&#8221; the most grievous of all social sins in the USA when expressed by Whites, and only Whites.</p>
