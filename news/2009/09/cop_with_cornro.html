<h1>Cop with Cornrows Pulled from Street Duty</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dana DiFilippo, Philadelphia Inquirer, Sept. 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A cop who got cornrows was ordered off the street and kept on desk duty for two days until he cut his braids off, sources said.</p>
<p>While dozens of black officers across the city wear cornrows, Officer Thomas Strain is white. So when the five-year veteran showed up for work Sept. 3 with the traditionally black hairstyle, it didn&rsquo;t take long for his colleagues  &mdash;  or his bosses  &mdash;  to notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;They pulled him out of roll call and took him right up to the inspector&rsquo;s office,&#8221; said an officer who asked to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Reached last week, Strain declined to comment about the hair hubbub.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The problem, police spokesman Lt. Frank Vanore said, is that Strain&rsquo;s superior didn&rsquo;t feel his cornrows were &#8220;professional.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ordering Strain to chop them off had nothing to do with discrimination, added Vanore, who spoke with Inspector Aaron Horne about the incident.</p>
<p>Horne [<em><strong>who is black  &mdash;  Ed.</strong></em>] who oversees the Northwest Police Division, which includes the 35th District, is the supervisor who directed Strain to banish the braids.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police policy requires officers to have &#8220;clean, properly trimmed and combed hair&#8221; that doesn&rsquo;t prevent them from wearing their uniform hat &#8220;in a military-manner,&#8221; Vanore said.</p>
<p>The policy prohibits &#8220;unnatural&#8221; hair colors such as blue, purple or green but doesn&rsquo;t ban specific styles, such as cornrows, mohawks, dreadlocks or bouffants.</p>
<p>Vanore didn&rsquo;t see Strain&rsquo;s cornrows, but speculated that they may have kept his hat from fitting his head in the required military manner. He couldn&rsquo;t explain why black officers with cornrows weren&rsquo;t ordered to get haircuts  &mdash;  unless they&rsquo;re women, because the hair policy for female officers is slightly more permissive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time an officer&rsquo;s appearance has caused commotion in the 35th District.</p>
<p>Officer Kimberlie Webb in 2005 sued the city and the police department after she was barred from wearing a hijab, or Muslim head scarf, on the job. A federal appeals court last April upheld the department&rsquo;s policy, saying religious garb imperils the department&rsquo;s appearance of &#8220;religious neutrality.&#8221;</p>

<p>But if you allow the black officers to, then i believe it is discrimination to not allow white officers.</p>

		<p>Good Greif, can you imagine this white cop with cornrows showing up when called? I know I would burst out laughing and immediately think low IQ. There is no way I could take him seriously. What in the world was he thinking? Cornrows look slap retarded on white people, and not any better on blacks. NO officer should be allowed to wear them.</p>

<p>Blacks have been leading the charge to call into question and do away with any and every standard of professionalism and decorum.</p>
<p>This is retribution against whitey for shoving the black mans&rsquo; demands for tolerance and inclusion in their face. <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;d be hesitant to comment too quickly. Blacks are given phenomenal&hellip;shall we say&hellip;latitude&hellip;in the standards of behavior and appearance they must &#8220;meet&#8221; in many metropolitan police departments. Officer Strain may be wearing his hair this way as a sort of &#8220;In Your Face&#8221; stunt to bring attention to what blacks in his agency can get away with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to know where the average citizen stands on police officers wearing their hair in cornrows. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found it unprofessional - it&rsquo;s a look that&rsquo;s outside the sort of conservative appearance people seem to prefer uniformed patrolmen to have. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a nurse. I&rsquo;ve always thought cornrows looked fine on black male medical workers.  It is a very neat, clean look.  Medical workers are supposed to look neat and clean,  like a female nurse with long hair pinned up in a neat bun. Corn rows are inappropriate for physicians even 25 year old interns, just too youthful and feminine for a male Doctor.</p>
<p>But on a male police officer black or white it is just not right. To me it is just effiminate and teen agey looking, not suitable for a male police officer.</p>

		<p>Cornrows may be appropriate for certain types of hair  &mdash;  it really means nothing to me one way or the other  &mdash;  but on Caucasian hair, it is simply ugly. I find it both aesthetically and culturally repugnant. </p>

		<p>I agree with Quiet Professional.  It could be an act of passive subversion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to work in a place where they let blacks wear dashikis or other African garb instead of suits.  I think a dashiki would be a lot more comfortable than a jacket &amp; tie in the summer!</p>

		<p>The police officer hopefully did now learn about the double- standard minorities and the PC media enforces. This realization could be his very first step towards developing a white identity, a white pride.</p>

He is making himself a target for the pc administrators. I salute his bravery and strategy. <br>
He got rid of it in 2 days. Just long enough to make a point and force them to punish him for something blacks do without getting punshed.He is on our side folks.</p>

		<p>It may be that the man is trying to show the double standard. Although I will say that he did look really silly with the hairdo he certainly illustrates a double standard if blacks are allowed to wear the hairstyle. To me the style looks thuggish, low intellegence and ghetto and for a police officer of any race to wear it shows that they have more of an allegiance with a criminal element. </p>
