			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Vitals, September 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dr. Cleveland Enmon is an emergency room physician at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Medical Center in Stockton . Dr. Enmon is accused of abandoning attempts to resuscitate a patient from cardiac arrest to instead pocket the dead man&rsquo;s valuable Rolex wristwatch. The suit, filed by the adult children of Jerry Keith Kubena, Sr., alleges that Dr. Cleveland James Enmon on June 1 &#8220;formed the intent&#8221; to swipe the Rolex from Kubena&rsquo;s wrist while treating the man at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Medical Center in Stockton.</p>
<p>The nursing staff assisting Enmon soon noticed that Kubena&rsquo;s flashy timepiece was missing; &#8220;Where is the wristwatch?&#8221; the suit quotes one as uttering. Two more nurses allegedly noticed a wristwatch-shaped bulge in the doctor&rsquo;s pocket. Security was called to investigate the disappearance. Defying security&rsquo;s orders, the lawsuit notes Enmon walked out of the operating room and into the parking lot, a move caught on hospital security cameras. A nurse claims she saw Enmon toss a small object into the grass and she subsequently led security personnel to that exact area and recovered the watch.</p>

		<p>According to the following weblink, it was a Rolex Presidential.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stockton Hospital Doctor Charged with Stealing Dying Man&rsquo;s Rolex&#8221;<br>
https://tinyurl.com/yajsu9v<br>
Here is an excerpt from the weblink:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;<br>
Kubena, a retired Manteca police lieutenant, was rushed by ambulance to St. Joseph&rsquo;s Medical Center in Stockton on June 1 with heart problems. According to a 15-page civil lawsuit, Kubena&rsquo;s family alleges Enmon noticed Kubena&rsquo;s expensive Presidential Rolex watch, then allowed Kubena to die from a heart attack so he could steal the watch.<br>
&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rolex Presidentials come in either 18-ct Gold or Platinum.  They are a wonder to behold.  They are unmistakable in appearance; I have never seen a convincing fake Rolex Presidential.  Nowadays, a new 18-ct yellow Gold, Rolex Presidential will command a price of approximately $50,000.00.</p>
<p>I believe anyone of any color would be tempted to steal such a watch.  In my opinion, even the entry level steel Rolexs such as the Submariners and GMT-IIs are just too flashy and too expensive (approximately $5,000.00) to wear in public.</p>
<p>I only wear my Rolexs while at home doing chores.</p>
<p>There is still one nagging question: Why is a retired police lieutenant wearing a Rolex Presidential?</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

		<p>When I first read the title I thought the Black doctor was located somewhere in Africa.  This is what a Black doctor would do - here in the US.  If a Black doctor would do this, then we have to think about a few things, don&rsquo;t we, namely what&rsquo;s it going to be like 10, 20, 30 years down the road?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to guess that the staff already knew what sort he was.  They noticed a &#8220;wristwatch shaped bulge in his pocket&#8221;.  They called security.  They followed him when he walked out.  I don&rsquo;t think that nurses are usually given to playing detective, nor directly challenging physicians.  Imagine the fix a nurse would be in for sending security after an innocent doctor, with such a nasty accusation.  This guy must have given them prior reason to mistrust him.  Were he a normal, decent, doctor, most people would have looked in their own pockets before accusing him.  </p>

<p>The profile you cite states that Enmon was &#8220;chief resident of Emergency Medicine in King-Drew Emergency Medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>King-Drew was shut down after repeated gross lapses in care, particularly in the trauma center. </p>
<p>A portion of the extensive wikipedia article on the facility:<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.-Harbor_Hospital" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.-Harbor_Hospital</a></p>
<blockquote>
Closure of the trauma center
<p>On September 13, 2004, DHS recommended the closure of King/Drew&rsquo;s busy trauma unit, stating that the hospital needs to put its full energy into fixing problems in other areas. Despite intense community opposition, the unit closed in early 2005. A few days later, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (now Joint Commission) threatened to pull its seal of approval, citing the medical center for failing to correct severe lapses in patient care and jeopardizing over $14 million in physician training funds. Despite being a rare move (99% of hospitals pass Joint Commission audits), King/Drew&rsquo;s seal of approval was revoked in February 2005.[3] Soon afterwards, in 2004 the Los Angeles Times revealed that the American College of Surgeons had revoked its approval of the quality of King/Drew&rsquo;s trauma unit in 1999 and 2003 because it failed to properly investigate questionable patient deaths and that doctors routinely skipped meetings held to discuss treatment problems. Also in September, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed with CMS to hire a new consulting firm to take over operations at the hospital: hiring Navigant Consulting takes over, and ultimately paying the firm more than $17 million for 18 months of work.<br>
By November 2004, massive neighborhood resistance to the proposed closures (particularly the trauma center) had formed, led by U.S. Representative Maxine Waters and joined by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, actress Angela Bassett and children of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Despite the protests, negative media editorials and the near-unanimous opposition of city political leaders, the five-member Board of Supervisors elected to move forward with the closure by a vote of 4 to 0 with one abstention. A temporary restraining order was filed by a group of doctors and residents, but was denied and the closure was completed in early 2005. Patients that had normally gone to the King/Drew trauma center were dispersed among three other hospitals, both public and private (with county subsidy).<br>
The move gained national attention after the Los Angeles Times ran a Pulitzer Prize-winning[1] five-part series reporting on &#8220;The Troubles at King/Drew&#8221;. The series found that the problems at the hospital were far deeper than the public already knew and faulted the Board of Supervisors for shying away from making needed changes, often because of racial politics. Among the other findings was that King/Drew spent more per patient than any of the three other general hospitals run by Los Angeles County, the opposite of what many hospital supporters had assumed.<br>
Meanwhile, in December 2004, CMS declared King/Drew patients are in &#8220;immediate jeopardy&#8221; for a third time; this time citing the staff&rsquo;s heavy reliance on county police to shoot aggressive mental patients with incapacitating jolts of electricity. Federal funds are again threatened, but, like the previous times, action is not taken.<br>
Problems for King/Drew were exacerbated in March 2005, when three patients died due to medical care lapses and mistakes over a period of four days. The Board of Supervisors considered severing the hospital&rsquo;s relationship with Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science and partnering with another medical school such as UCLA, USC or Loma Linda University. In April, reports of a seventh death attributed to lapses in care by the hospital was reported by the Los Angeles Times; this time, nurses and staff virtually ignored the audio and visual cues of vital-sign monitors over a period of hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make-or-break&#8221; inspection</p>
<p>After the three previous warnings holding King/Drew out of compliance with federal guidelines since January 2004, CMS and federal authorities held an unannounced, last chance inspection of the hospital on July 31 and completed on August 10, 2006.<br>
On September 22, 2006, CMS informed King/Drew that the hospital still did not meet minimum patient-care standards, failing nine of the government&rsquo;s 23 conditions for federal funding, and thus had failed the final, &#8220;make-or-break&#8221; inspection. Federal regulators identified problems in nursing, pharmacy, infection control, surgical services, rehabilitation services, quality control, patients&rsquo; rights and the hospital&rsquo;s governing body and physical plant. Inspectors found more problems during the final inspection than they had at any time in the previous three years.<br>
The final report stated, and underlined, that &#8220;Termination of the Medicare provider agreement is final.&#8221; This finding jeopardized $200 million a year in federal funding, forcing Los Angeles County to close the public hospital, give it to someone else to run or turn it into a clinic.<br>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m going to guess that the staff already knew what sort he was. They noticed a &ldquo;wristwatch shaped bulge in his pocket&rdquo;. They called security. They followed him when he walked out. I don&rsquo;t think that nurses are usually given to playing detective, nor directly challenging physicians.&#8221;</p>
<p>My first thought.  I am sure he is the typical disfunctional black, so the nurses keep an eye on him in hopes of catching him in some overt act of wrong doing.  Stockton nurses are pretty much hispanic and filippino. They don&rsquo;t like blacks to begin with and they don&rsquo;t like seeing patient&rsquo;s health put in jeopardy by disfunctional black doctors.</p>
<p>When I worked a clerical night shift in a hospital, there was one black doctor who was assigned to the emergency room who spent his entire shift down in our section complaining to the black clerical workers about how he was discriminated against.</p>
<p>We had a cozy little area, fridge, microwaves and booths for the drs to do their dictation in.  The booths were furnished with extremely comfortable chairs.  This doctor often spent his entire shift in our cozy little section.</p>
<p>He did practically no work for his salary.  Meanwhile, up in the ER the other drs did his work and patients were in danger of dying or further injury because one of the drs who was supposed to be there was off lounging around, eating and complaining about discrimination.</p>

		<p>In 1978 I had a stainless steel Rolex Datejust just &#8220;disappear&#8221; in the hospital ER where I was taken after a very bad auto accident.  The emergency room was staffed by several blacks but I was never sure who stole my watch as I didn&rsquo;t miss it until I got home the next day.  On your feedback to this incident &#8220;Electrical Engineer&#8221; wrote that Rolex Presidentials sell for $50,000.  This is incorrect for the following:  watch may have been an older Rolex and a check with Rolex dealers indicate you can purchase a new gold Presidental Rolex for much less than $50,000.  </p>

		<p>Bling is bling, whether you&rsquo;re Caucasian or not.  Why in the world spend even $500 on a watch?  Your cell phone keeps better time.  If you admire White craftsmanship, buy yourself some good tools.  Or donate the money to a worthy White cause.  I&rsquo;m never too sympathetic to Whites who choose to wear black bait on their wrist.  &#8220;I spend, therefore I am&#8221;.  </p>

<p>The view count was at 543 when I viewed it. I don&rsquo;t think there is any conspiracy on the part of YouTube to artificially lower the view count, although they certainly won&rsquo;t make it a featured video. No matter. The news report shows a picture of the victim but IT DOES NOT SHOW A PICTURE OF THE GOOD DOCTOR, nor any mention of his race. As usual, the coverup is on the part of the MSM, not YouTube.</p>

<p>&hellip;  I believe anyone of any color would be tempted to steal such a watch. In my opinion, even the entry level steel Rolexs such as the Submariners and GMT-IIs are just too flashy and too expensive (approximately $5,000.00) to wear in public.</p>

<p>No, not anyone of any color. Most people, most whites, trying to help someone suffering from a heart attack would probably not be paying any attention to the victim&rsquo;s jewelry. I doubt most E. Asians would be looking for a five-finger discount either during that type of situation. However, I think most blacks and mestizos would be looking to snag whatever they could. Here in L.A. I can remember seeing a car accident downtown and blacks and mexicans running to the vehicle. For a few seconds it looked like they were trying to help and then I realized they were stealing items from the car while the passengers were loopy from the collision. It was unbelievable. The whole thing took only a few seconds. Then they all ran. Impulsive opportunists with no empathy for anything or anyone. </p>

		<p>I amagine the good  &#8220;doctor&#8221;  would have to make sure the patient didn&rsquo;t wake up and notice he was missing his watch.</p>
<p>How awkward that would be!</p>
<p>Moral: Don&rsquo;t wear expensive jewelry if you have a heart attack.<br>
It diminishes your chances of recovery. </p>

		<p>Evidently, these sorts of things must happen in hospitals!<br>
This story was extremely interesting to me, for personal reasons. </p>
<p>Some 20 years ago I had a dear friend who died in the hospital shortly after I had visited. After his death, at the funeral, another friend (whom I knew only slightly) mentioned that his watch had disappeared and suggestively implied that I had been the only one  whose name was in the visitor&rsquo;s book on that day.  I was very stung at this and am still pained by the veiled accusation that I would steal a watch from a dying person!   Now, years later, it all kind of falls into place and makes some sense to me after all.</p>

		<p>I believe that two cases should be opened here:</p>
<p>#1. that of the doctor, and<br>
#2. that of how a retired cop could afford a $50,000  watch.</p>
<p>Frankly, I am astonished that the deceased&rsquo;s family would even dare to report this loss, since they could be opening a nasty can of worms. They might have preferred to take the loss and keep their silence.</p>

		<p>Please forgive my spelling.  Perhaps, I should correct the word &#8220;Rolexs&#8221; to read as &#8220;Rolexes.&#8221;  It is not too often that a person would write the plural form of Rolex.</p>
<p>Yes, I do only wear my Rolexes whenever I do chores around the house.  Too many people in public just know the difference between the fakes and genuine Rolexes; recently, after having my Rolexes disassembled, cleaned, and oiled, I wore them in public, and too many of the wrong kind of people took notice, and my Rolexes are only the entry-level kind (all stainless steel).  It must be the color of the steel which is different from the usual steel used in modern day watches.</p>
<p>The estimated price of $50,000.00 is a tad high; however, I was amazed to discover that the new models of the Rolexes I own command a price in the range of $5000.00 and over.  This is approximately 4 times the amount I paid for mine.  The amazing part is that my Rolexes are now considered to be vintage watches, and they currently command a vintage price about 4 times that for which I paid.  I guess it is true that Rolexes hold their value over time.  At the time I bought my Rolexes, the Rolex Presidential was in the neighborhood of $10,000.00 to $12,000.00 at an authorized dealership.  So by multiplying by 4, one will arrive at the price range of $40,000.00 to $48,000.00.<br>
Recently, at one of my favorite watch dealers, the proprietor was showing a used Rolex Presidential to some other proprietor; I overheard one say to the other that a new Rolex Presidential was in the neighborhood of $50,000.00.  That is how I got that figure.</p>
<p>I would not recommend anyone to buy a Rolex, for the following reasons:<br>
1.  Too expensive for what Rolexes are.<br>
2.  Cannot buy original parts for Rolexes, as the distribution of Rolex parts is very closely guarded by Rolex.  (This is an issue if you happen to work on your own watches.)<br>
3.  Too risky to wear due to possible muggings.  (Yes, I believe that the death of this retired lieutenant may have been motivated by perpetrator&rsquo;s desire to eliminate the victim as a witness).<br>
4.  Designs and Engineering may be considered somewhat antiquated.</p>
<p>I believe Seiko now makes the finest production watches in the world.  Until recently, the best Seikos (Seikoes?) can only be purchased in Japan, but now their upper mid-range automatics are available in the United States of America.  They carry a price tag of approximately one fourth that of a Rolex   &mdash;   I believe this is the first time that Seiko would be a part of the high-end price bracket, here in the United States of America.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening. </p>

The funny part is if you have ever been to the ER you will notice that the person working on you is the Doctor. The doctor does not really have time to make decision other than those orders that are being tossed around to the staff to save lives. There are also about 12 other people in the room tops that come from some of everywhere, nurses, ect&hellip;</p>
<p>If everyone at work was working to save this man when does anyone have time to look at the doctor&rsquo;s pocket? I&rsquo;m around people at work and I don&rsquo;t look at their pockets.I don&rsquo;t care. <br>
Mainly, if you think about it there is somehthing funny about this story because if you notice in the coverage of the video, the medical board person did not get wind of this story until Sept. The crime happened in June. (For those of you that play chess, you might come up with a total different game.) <br>
