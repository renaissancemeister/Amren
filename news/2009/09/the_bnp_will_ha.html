<h1>The BNP Will Have to Adapt or Die, Warns Party Leader</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BNP News, September 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British National Party will have to adapt to the undemocratic Orwellian &#8216;equality laws&rsquo; with regards to party membership criteria, or it will die, party leader Nick Griffin warned in reaction to today&rsquo;s court hearing brought by the Commission for Equality &amp; Human Rights (CEHR).</p>
<p>&#8220;The CEHR move is a deadly serious threat to our very existence,&#8221; Mr Griffin said in a statement this evening. He pointed out that the severe danger to the party was illustrated by the fact that the court ordered the BNP to pay the costs of today&rsquo;s hearing  &mdash;  which amount to thousands of pounds  &mdash;  and yet nothing had been decided.</p>
<p>To pursue the case all the way to an appeal in the House of Lords could cost the party more than a million pounds, he continued. This would effectively strip the party of its ability to fight the next general election.</p>
<p>Even though the outcome of the case is still undecided, Mr Griffin said that whatever the court might decide, &#8220;the forthcoming Equality Bill will, in any case, simply and unavoidably ban any political party from discriminating on grounds of ethnicity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The entire court case is therefore pointless even from the CEHR&rsquo;s position, and is clearly designed only to bleed the party of its funding.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said any decision on amending the BNP&rsquo;s constitution in this matter would &#8220;stick in the craw of all dedicated nationalists&#8221; but that it was a choice of &#8220;evolving and living to fight another day or going down in a blaze of glory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said the starting point for any debate had to be &#8220;an understanding that the new law will shortly ban ethnically defined parties anyway. This makes the CEHR&rsquo;s waste of public money so disgraceful and their attempt to bleed us to death by a totally unnecessary legal action so cynical and despicable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could still fight it all the way on a point of stubborn principle  &mdash;  I think that most party old hands have worked out some time ago that I can be pretty damn stubborn when the time is right. The decision is not just mine to make,&#8221; he said, adding that it was a decision which must be taken by the party as a collective whole.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin said that if the party wanted to fight the case all the way, it would need to raise an extra £80,000 in the next four weeks. Some £20,000 would be needed this week to buy in more top lawyers&rsquo; time to triple check and hone to perfection the changes the party would have to make in its constitution and organisation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt that it is possible to redraft our constitution so as to ensure we comply with the new law while at the same time holding true to our core principles and most importantly of all, to our purpose  &mdash;  which is to secure a future for the true children of our islands,&#8221; Mr Griffin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;By taking this as far as a court hearing, we have ensured that party unity will be maintained, because whatever steps we take, it is now crystal clear to all concerned that we simply do not have a choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adapt or die is the only decision left to make, for failure to adapt would lead either to our being bled white through the courts or crushed by new criminal laws. Party unity is priceless, because a party of brothers standing shoulder to shoulder can be persecuted, but it can never be beaten or broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin concluded with a promise that once the party had moved to a &#8220;truly defensible position, we will go on the attack. Not just politically, so that our enemies quickly rue the day when they broke the very stick with which they have beaten us for so long, but also legally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be going into legal battle against Trevor Phillips and the rest of the &#8216;curs&rsquo;, but it will be fought on ground that we choose, at the time that we appoint, and with our maximum strength directed against their weakest point. Our time will come  &mdash;  and sooner than they think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin&rsquo;s full statement is as follows:</p>
<p><big><b>Statement from BNP leader Nick Griffin MEP on the Commission for Equality &amp; Human Rights (CEHR) Case</b></big></p>
<p>02 September 2009</p>
<p>The barrister representing the party was at court on our behalf and got what we wanted  &mdash;  a seven week adjournment. This gives us the time and space we need to continue the urgent debate which opened with the very constructive and mature discussion meeting at the Red, White and Blue.</p>
<p>But most important of all, we have established two crucial points that had to be made, and could only be made by taking this as far as court, despite the inevitable cost.</p>
<p>The first is that the CEHR move, although motivated by their own internal political feuds as much as anything else, is a deadly serious threat to our very existence.</p>
<p>This is neither a game nor a phantom concern conjured up in order to push through changes to the constitution  &mdash;  which might well be electorally advantageous  &mdash;  but would stick in the craw of us dedicated nationalists.</p>
<p>Either we shift our position or we will be utterly crushed. That fact was established beyond any possible doubt when the judge ruled that we must pay the thousands of pounds of costs of today&rsquo;s hearing.</p>
<p>How much that bill will be, we cannot tell, because part of the grotesque unfairness of this is that we will be forced to hire the services of a very good legal firm simply to argue that the figure which will be proposed by Trevor Phillips and co will be far too high and has to be reduced to something sensible and proportionate.</p>
<p>For us to take this case to the next hearing would mean raising and risking at least £80,000. To take it all the way to the House of Lords would swallow up well over a million Pounds.</p>
<p>Even if we were likely to win, we could only afford this with a super human effort which would involve, among other sacrifices, virtually abandoning the next general election.</p>
<p>What makes that course of action even more of a Charge of the Light Brigade gesture is, that whatever the court decides in October, the forthcoming Equality Bill will, in any case, simply and unavoidably ban any political party from discriminating on grounds of ethnicity.</p>
<p>By taking this as far as a court hearing, we have ensured that party unity will be maintained, because whatever steps we take, it is now crystal clear to all concerned that we simply do not have a choice.</p>
<p>Adapt or die is the only decision left to make, for failure to adapt would lead either to our being bled white through the courts or crushed by new criminal laws.</p>
<p>Party unity is priceless, because a party of brothers standing shoulder to shoulder can be persecuted, but it can never be beaten or broken.</p>
<p>The second vital point we&rsquo;ve made clear by letting this get all the way to court is that traditional British justice  &mdash;  indeed, the very essence of Britishness  &mdash;  is dead, murdered as part of New Labour´s creeping coup d&rsquo;état.</p>
<p>Two of the great and ancient cornerstones of our true British identity are fairness and the unbreakable rule that institutions of the state must be bound by the rule of law.</p>
<p>The creation of CEHR and this persecution shattered both of those cornerstones. It is grotesquely unfair that a state-funded bureaucracy with 70 top lawyers and £70 million to burn, can decide, without showing a shred of evidence of any wrongdoing, to persecute a group of twelve and a half thousand mainly working class volunteers.</p>
<p>When the CEHR was established, it was originally intended to be bound by the kind of restrictions that are rightly imposed on all state bodies. The Labour government and the political elite have scrapped the safeguards.</p>
<p>The CEHR is an autocratic power block which can go before any court and follow the maxim of Humpty Dumpty in Alice through the Looking Glass that &#8220;it means just what I choose it to mean  &mdash;  neither more nor less.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our lawyers&rsquo; highly compelling argument that the principle of Equality of Arms means that CEHR should fund our defence (as they would indeed assist any organisation representing literally any other ethnic group) was simply brushed aside by CEHR&rsquo;s own lawyers, and thus not even considered by the court.</p>
<p>The shocking truth is that not even the Inland Revenue has this amount of power. The tax-grabbers are at least required to be, and to show, that they are fair.</p>
<p>The CEHR are empowered to do whatever they think fit. This is not British; it isn&rsquo;t cricket. It is a fundamental change not just in our law but in our entire culture.</p>
<p>The scale of CEHR&rsquo;s power and monstrous arrogance is best shown by the fact that their lawyers seriously proposed to the court to settle in a mere two hours the fundamental question raised by this case: namely whether indigenous groups recognised in law as having their ethnic origins in these islands (Eilias v MoD) and covered by the liberal-left&rsquo;s own Race Relations Act are entitled to form associations of their own kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, they know perfectly well that we are. They know that we are, hence the brutal use of their legal steamroller to ensure that we cannot afford to make this particular case the Cause Celebre that would bring the point home to untold numbers more who are at present in blissful ignorance of our rights and duties as the first peoples of these, our islands.</p>
<p>So where do we go from here? The starting point for the debate has to be an understanding that the new law will shortly ban ethnically defined parties anyway, which makes CEHR&rsquo;s waste of public money so disgraceful, and their attempt to bleed us to death by a totally unnecessary legal action, so cynical and despicable.</p>
<p>We could still fight it all the way on a point of stubborn principle  &mdash;  I think that most party old hands have worked out some time ago that I can be pretty damn stubborn when the time is right. The decision as to whether this is the right time to stand and go down in a blaze of glory, or to evolve and live to fight another day, is one that is not just mine to make. It is yours as well.</p>
<p>If the party collectively wants to fight, then we have to raise £80,000 extra in the next four weeks. If the party collectively wants to guarantee its survival, then we need £20,000 this week to buy in more top lawyers&rsquo; time to triple check and hone to perfection the changes we would have to make to our constitution and organisation.</p>
<p>We have already identified these, but our rough diamonds have to be cut and polished, and our iron tempered into the brightest steel.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that it is possible to redraft our constitution so as to ensure we comply with the new law while at the same time holding true to our core principles and most important of all to our purpose  &mdash;  to secure a future for the true children of our islands.</p>
<p>And I promise you one thing beyond this: That once we have moved to a truly defensible position we will go on the attack.</p>
<p>Not just politically, so that our enemies quickly rue the day when they broke the very stick with which they have beaten us for so long, but also legally.</p>
<p>We will be going into legal battle against Trevor Phillips and the rest of the &#8216;curs&rsquo;, but it will be fought on ground that we choose, at the time that we appoint, and with our maximum strength directed against their weakest point. Our time will come  &mdash;  and sooner than they think.<br>

		<p>This will not be a tragedy. Very few minorities will want to join. A few government provocateurs who want to infiltrate &amp; destroy the BNP will be marginalized. And an honorable very few minorities who recognize that the BNP is the only hope for the continuation of English civilization can be accomodated. This option is better than going bankrupt by fighting the self-hating establishment. </p>

		<p>Nick Griffin is a good man.  I have no doubt that his leadership will help the BNP along.  He understands the game they are being forced to play and they will play it.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all wish them well.</p>
<p>Has anyone donated to the BNP?  Does English law allow donation from sources outside the UK?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see why it is such a bad deal for the BNP to adapt and allow non-whites into the fold.  Much of what the BNP desires for Britain, especially in the way of independence form the EU, and severe reductions in immigration( esp. phony asylum seeking &amp; illegal invasions from third world Muslim countries)and even an emphasis &amp; celebration of British culture &amp; pride, can be supported by many non-white British. Core principles must be accepted by new members to avoid dishonesty &amp; subversion, but I would think as a more open party it can better succeed. </p>

		<p>How many non-whites would actually join the BNP knowing its &#8220;racist&#8221; reputation?</p>
<p>A legal fund should be set up for the BNP.  I&rsquo;d be willing to contribute.  Lots of people would, Mr. Griffin.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure as to how this will pan out - however while the government and its agencies are trying to flood the BNP with non-white members who will infiltrate and ultimately neuter it - I think the BNP is well within its rights to expel those (of whatever colour) it believes are operating against it, or don&rsquo;t share it&rsquo;s values. The Labour Party expelled Militant afterall because they weren&rsquo;t on side.</p>

		<p>Anonymous:  No, sometime between the 2001 and 2005 British elections, the UK Govt. passed a law prohibiting foreign donations to British political parties.  Before 2001, there was an organization called the American Friends of the British National Party (AFBNP), out of D.C., with a British expat named Mark Cotterill running it.  Once the UK changed its law, the AFBNP had to shut down, for its only purpose was to raise money.  AFAIK, Cotterrill is back in the UK, but not active with the BNP.</p>

		<p>If ethnic minorities want to join the BNP, and unsurprisingly they don&rsquo;t, take their money but ensure they have no voice. Its awin win situation. The Vaams Blok legally changed to the Vaams Belang so if needs be that can be done too.<br>
Interesting point no.6 about foreign donations. There is always talk in the media about the Conservatives receiving money from Lord Ashcroft, a Briton based overseas, and yet no mention of labours Indian backers Noon, Paul, Mittal etc. Perhaps there is grounds for the BNP to make a complaint or means to attack labour on the basis they are in the pockets of Indian billionaires. </p>

<p>This is the key point in all of it, and I am very glad Mr Griffin and co. have their heads screwed on the right way. They&rsquo;re keeping cool heads, and getting settled into the arm wrestle, even if it means taking a backward step now and then.</p>

		<p>As a British National Party member and having attended several meetings, and assisted in leaflet distribution etc, I have a feeling that the self-loathing indigenous white Marxist Liberal establishment <b>via its enabled non-white alien-led CEHR, will take it upon itself to proscribe the British National Party&rsquo;s core manifesto and subsequent principles in relation to its being fundamentally, a Party set up to effect and secure the preservation of indigenous white Britons namely, the (English, Irish Scots and Welsh) and their respective heritages, beliefs and cultures.</b></p>
<p>The international bankster-led Communist political system presently running Britain, is perfectly aware that to destroy the rights and aspirations of the indigenous peoples by criminalising their attempts to resist dispossession, displacement and ultimately, genocide, it must operate any and every type of blatently obvious and racist double-standard across the whole of the societal infrastructure otherwise it will be risking the beginning of its own downfall.  Furthermore, because of its depth of entrenchment into the political, judical and social spectrums, it feels it no longer needs to strive to keep hidden its blatent anti-white, anti-indigenous race-hating credentials.  In other words, it&rsquo;s not afraid to display them anymore.  Its pertinent institutions even stoop to the criminal act of vote-rigging to remain in power.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid as I&rsquo;ve said on more than one occasion, WMDs are going to be required to scatter it and thus collapse its present power structure.<br>

		<p>this is a blatant attempt to suppress the BNP - the plan is to fill it with provocative anti racist minority &#8216;members&rsquo; and disrupt it - in any event it clearly shows there is no longer ANY right to association in the UK (and US for that matter) </p>
<p>and clearly, in our &#8216;democracies&rsquo; it is clearly illegal to oppose the marxist one-world agenda&hellip;..</p>
<p>I wonder&hellip;can conservative christians sue to belong to gay activist groups and carry out their agenda there? </p>

<p><br>
This is correct. I know as I am a North American who has donated to BNP from outside UK. I contacted the Party first, and was told to keep my donation under 200 pounds, which I did. </p>
<p>Supporters outside UK may also buy Overseas Membership in the BNP, for 55 pounds per year. Anyone who wishes to show their support for the BNP&rsquo;s present WHITES ONLY Constitution should do so VERY SOON, i.e. within the next few weeks. I will be joining myself   &mdash;   because I want to be able to say that I joined the BNP while it was still an explicitly and unapologetically White party. It&rsquo;s a point of pride for me to possess a membership card dated BEFORE they were forced to change their policy. </p>
<p>As for what will happen to the BNP once it is no longer allowed to be Whites Only, I don&rsquo;t foresee any major disasters as a result of this change. Certainly I would prefer if the Party could go on as it is, but the organization that Mr. Griffin &amp; Co. have built up by now is extremely strong   &mdash;   too strong to be stopped by the arrival of some nonwhite agents provocateurs who will join just to attempt disruption from within. </p>
<p>The British National Party shall go on   &mdash;   with or without the approval of the anti-white racist Trevor Phillips and his absurd &#8220;Equalities&#8221; (sic) Commission. Not only will they go on, but I am convinced that   &mdash;   eventually   &mdash;   they will PREVAIL. </p>

		<p>This technique is pure scientology.  Massive legal attacks on anyone they wish as both scientology and this labour government have huge war chests funded by their members, willing or not. Most cases don&rsquo;t even get to court but are designed to bleed the target of funds and exhaust their meagre resources. There is no way out for the moment but to capitulate and save funds for the forthcoming general election as this present quasi-legal fiasco is simply to prevent this small but legal political party from fighting their legitimate corner. Considering that the labour government have consistently claimed that the BNP is such a minor, unimportant and non-threatening political party, this is very much a &#8216;sledgehammer to crack a nut&rsquo; policy. They never expected to see a couple of BNP MEP&rsquo;s and are now frightened about the snowballing success, and considering other stories on this same AMREN page it is obvious that the evils of immigration and alien &#8216;cultures&rsquo; do tremendous harm to our indigenous British population. So where is the harm in admitting absolutely anyone into the party? A well publicised nice picture and biography of the first non-Whites to be admitted will satisfy the racist policy of this communist government and should do wonders for recruitment. I really can&rsquo;t see hordes of applicants but, in any case, recruitment and membership fees will help fill the depleted coffers. The CEHR is publicly funded by the taxpayer who, individually, have no say in how this money is spent, except through the ballot box. It must be remembered that this government is, in any case, doomed and cannot possibly win the next general election. They are devoid of candidates, many having been forced into resignation by the very constituents who elected them. They were disgraced following the expenses scandal and most of the remainder are just hanging on to their lucrative seats for as long as possible. Considering that the immigration policy has encouraged millions to enter the UK, mainly from pakistan, and there are already many of these in government, I foresee hundreds wanting to stand to represent the labour party to the utter dismay of the population at large but leaving labour in the embarrassing position of being unable to reject any of them because of the racial aspect. Female muslims will certainly be discouraged from standing for parliament by their male relatives which will be another stick at which to bash labour as the feminists will certainly object. Perhaps all is not lost, Obama raised much of his campaign funding from millions of very small donations, thanks to the internet, and this technique could very well work for the BNP, especially as this present CEHR case will evoke much sympathy for the White underdog and many heartfelt thanks are due to AMREN for highlighting this story.</p>

		<p>As much as we don&rsquo;t like to admit it, much of politics still involves shepherds leading sheep. That&rsquo;s easy enough to see just by following political debates and talking to people about social issues. I don&rsquo;t expect that to change much but perhaps the BNP can raise the temperature a bit by pushing against established boundaries. Make the authorities sweat a bit by talking about things that they&rsquo;d rather be kept quiet. I often ponder about three areas that seem important in the national question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the interlacing between culture, ethnicity, and race; there are many issues involved. How many Brits know what a group evolutionary strategy is? </p>
<p>The pro-diversity forces have their social theorists. Britain has Terry Eagleton, Anthony Giddens, and Stuart Hall among others. Why not talk about their theories and show how other experts in sociology have criticized them? Explain to Brits that a social experiment has been foisted on them without adequate theory to support it.</p>
<p>I think religion can be tackled. Does the Chrisitian clergy in Britain even believe that Christianity is a true religion? Can they make any claims that it is important to be Christian?  </p>

<p>Enoch, Nick and Mr. Lepin of France have given the electorate opportunity, but the white electorate have chosen extinction.</p>
<p>It is the same in the United States.  The election of Obama and all the appointments of everything but whites will set the stage in the next four years for absolute catastrophe for white people.</p>
<p>Mr Geert Wilders is trying, but I suspect he also will fail because of the ignorance of the people he is trying to save.</p>

<p>I hate to say this.  I say it with regret, and I am not advising it. But this is what produces revolutions, violence, and terrorism.   When a people have been deprived  of all legitimate means for defending their interests, and all reasonable avenues are closed,  they will be forced to resort to extreme measures and revolt.   It is what caused the American Revolution. It is what provoked Irish independence when they could have been kept within the British fold.  Has doddering old Mother England learned nothing from her own history?  Does she want the next revolution to be right at home? </p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t revolt because they want to.  They revolt because it  is the last measure  available to them. They revolt in desperation because they are left with no other choice.</p>

I&rsquo;m not sure.  It could be well meant, or it could be a disarming comment.  </p>
<p>Thanks for the good will anyway, but we will do best to handle our own problems by ourselves, thank you. There&rsquo;s no reason why you need to get personally involved in our politics. Taking an interest is another thing than joining a party. The party should be for the nationals only. You can like Shakespeare just as much, without belonging to the BNP.</p>
<p>I, as a foreigner, take an interest in French politics; but I am not a Frenchman and I have not attempted to join LePen&rsquo;s party. Nor should I.  I wouldn&rsquo;t belong there. It is for Frenchmen.</p>
<p>Does the writer live in England? That makes a difference. But if so, it&rsquo;s all the more reason to be cautious.  I may wish the Japanese good luck good luck (and I do) with preserving their nation and culture, but I have not moved to Japan and tried to insert myself into their politics.  That&rsquo;s another thing.  Their political parties should remain their own, not open to me.  I wish them good luck &hellip; but from afar. That is the best way.</p>
<p>We are grateful for all friendly wishes, but we should beware of strangers who want to help too much. History tells us about Greeks bearing gifts.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve no doubt that Trevor Phillips (the head of the &#8216;Equalities Commission&rsquo;, spearheading the vendetta against the BNP), sees his campaign in terms of a &#8216;blood feud&rsquo; (in the manner of Bobby Kennedy versus Jimmy Hoffa)waged personally against Nick Griffin.<br>
I&rsquo;ve no doubt that Trevor Phillips has a poster of Nick Griffin stuck on his office wall which he sares at with a ritual hatred every morning.<br>
 Here we have the unelected, fat public-salaried Trevor Phillips (who apart from professional race-hustling has never done a day&rsquo;s work in his life),a man who doesn&rsquo;t have a drop of British blood in his body, vowing unto death (and being backed-up all the way by the wretched New Labour) to destroy the last vestige of defence of an 8000 year old blood-line that shook the World.<br>
 - The fact is this.By mid-century Britain will be majority non-White.By centory&rsquo;s end Whites will be a small and despised minority.<br>

		<p>If the BNP took on a women&rsquo;s rights platform they could show up the hipocracy of Labour and could shame both Labour and the Muslim extremists.  The BNP could take a stand against forced marriage, women being forced to wear the burka, female circumsion, women being denied education, honor killings and domestic abuse against women.</p>
<p>Labour has allowed these attrocities to go on for years because of their acceptance of multi-culturalism.  They have excused many attrocities against women such as the practice of kidnapping women and forcing them to marry against their will.  The leftist Labour approach is to ignore these violations of human rights or to exuse them as just being &#8220;part of their culture&#8221;.  </p>
<p>In addition to the Muslim attrocities there are other cultures that bring barbaric practices to Britain.  The African practice of &#8220;muti&#8221; is one of them.  Muti is a form of black magick which requires the murder of a human victim and the severing of a body part to be used in their practices of magick.  This not only takes place in Africa but has also occured in Britain. A couple of years ago, the mutilated body of a young African boy was found in the Thames.  The police traced the identity of the boy through the clothing that he was wearing.  They eventually found the people envolved.  This story was shown on television here in the US.</p>
<p>The BNP can start a human rights campaign against these attrocities listed without necessarily singling out the ethnic groups who are involved.  That is not necessary as they will know who they are.  This would be a huge embarassment to Labour and will show them to be the hypocrites that they are.  What is Labour to say, that it is racist to opposed brutality against women and murder of innocents?  This campaign will inform and outrage the British citizens since, you can be sure that the press has been trying to hide and minimize these barbaric practices.  Once the BNP brings this out in the open, who will have the moral high ground then?</p>

<p>Good analysis, Anonymous.   But this unpleasant prospect comes as no surprise to the small (but growing) percentage of white nationalists who fully understand the depth and passionate degree of raw hatred that the #1 enemy of our race is driven by.</p>
<p>These forces are not going to cease and desist in their obsession to exterminate our race and to physically destroy every majority white nation, simply because a few of our pro-white leaders speak out in our defense.  If anything, the wide spread evidence that whites around the world are beginning to wake up and react in ways to defend themselves, only increases the maniacal passion of this enemy to accelerate this evil genocide campaign.  </p>
<p>This enemy is not rational and is driven by uncontrollable hate and, fortunately for us, seems to be incapable of knowing when it is time to back off.  This means that as they get more and more aggressive in their war of extermination, more and more white people will wake up to their agenda.   </p>
<p>Anonymous is a man of vision.   Our survival is not going to be guaranteed and our future secured by the peaceful avenues of political discourse, because this enemy intends to close them off.   And, the final option was anticipated by our  enemy and this is why they&rsquo;ve worked to hard to disarm the white populations of Britain, Australia, Canada - and to a less successful extent, the United States.</p>
<p>It is also why they have worked like termites on steroids to create the totalitarian, police state and this eerie Orwellian and illegal surveillance apparatus across the White, Western world - using the highly suspicious and curiously convenient 9-11 event as the pretext.</p>
<p>This enemy is not fooling around, fellow AR readers.  This enemy plays hard ball.   </p>

I don&rsquo;t have a big problem with Duke, or any other &#8220;extremist,&#8221; but they should recognize their role: to fill an ideological void, to popularize important ideas the mainstream is currently ignoring, to work their butts off organizationally and rhetorically, and then to get the hell out of the way when partially as a result of their hard work and bravery the gist of their agenda is adopted by parts of the political mainstream.

<p>This is what I am constantly writing to any non-white who reads a post on Amren;  If they destroy the white race, there will be no &#8220;West&#8221; to benefit the third world.  Like the doctor who brings patients into his house and soon impoverished, the wealthy nations cannot sustain increasing poverty within their own borders.  They cannot allow the factious elements that cause trouble and the very issues that prevent progress in their home countries to become anywhere near a significant mass within those countries that mean to improve the world.  Just as a doctor would, a healthy nation OR group of nations that share a common bond - LIKE EUROPE or the US/Canada, they have a self-interest to have healthy nations about, just as the doctor doesn&rsquo;t want disease all about.  </p>
<p>The despoilment of Europe and the Western World will cause the entire world to crash, and crash hard.  This little recession is nothing.  The main event is only about 5-10 years off, in my estimation, that is about the time that it will become obvious that world resources are disappearing much faster than thought and the competition for what is left will begin a snow-ball of wars and civil unrest.</p>

Or South Africa which supplied all of Africa with foods and jobs due to the white skilled farmers that since the dismantling of aparteid have been likewise brutally murdered by the blacks to all of Africa&rsquo;s impoverishment.
