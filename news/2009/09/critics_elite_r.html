<h1>Critics: Elite Rangers Not Welcome at Texas Border</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Sherman and Alicia A. Caldwell, Yahoo News, Sept. 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rancher Mike Landry recently came upon a group of unarmed men dressed in camouflage burglarizing his guest house and stealing a truck from his 11,000 acres in Terrell County, rugged country bordering the Rio Grande in West Texas.</p>
<p>A couple of shots over their heads from his hunting rifle kept nine of them, all Mexican citizens, in place until Border Patrol agents arrived.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stories like Landry&rsquo;s seem to bolster Gov. Rick Perry&rsquo;s recent decision to send elite teams from the state&rsquo;s top law enforcement agency, the Texas Rangers, to remote borderlands to help them with security and deter a spillover of the gruesome drug-war violence plaguing Mexico. But Landry&rsquo;s situation never grew violent, and many other ranchers, sheriffs and politicians along Texas&rsquo; 1,200 mile border with Mexico found the governor&rsquo;s announcement puzzling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perry&rsquo;s critics note that border crime has been falling in recent years  &mdash;  a point the governor concedes  &mdash;  and question whether sending some of the state&rsquo;s 144 crack investigators supported by Texas National Guard troops to areas that have seen nothing worse than burglaries is a wise use of resources.</p>
<p>Terrell County is 2,300 square miles of desolation just north of the Rio Grande. Sheriff Clint McDonald and his six deputies protect its 1,200 residents on an otherworldly landscape that includes 60 miles of border.</p>
<p>Smuggling traffic is up this year, illustrated by 20 burglaries of ranches and hunting camps compared with two at this time last year, McDonald said, though he noted there was no violent crime. Smugglers&rsquo; &#8220;mules&#8221; carry marijuana, cocaine and heroin 30 or 40 miles north of the river in backpacks and break into ranches and hunting camps on their way back to Mexico for food and weapons, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Texas Border Coalition, a group of politicians and business people, maintains that the talk of spillover violence is overblown. Border Patrol apprehensions have made double-digit drops this year in every sector along the Texas-Mexico border except the Marfa sector, which includes Terrell County. That area has a fraction of the border apprehensions, but those are up about 15 percent compared with last year. The coalition asked Perry for more coordination and objected to his implication of &#8220;lawless hordes overrunning the border region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lupe Trevino, the elected Democratic sheriff of urban Hidalgo County, said the Ranger Recon program was &#8220;an obvious political ploy&#8221; as Perry wades into a bruising Republican primary for re-election against U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t need the Texas Rangers to come to the border to quell any imaginary disturbance,&#8221; said Trevino, vice chairman of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s Southwest Border Task Force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Wilson said Perry&rsquo;s announcement that the Ranger Recons would be used to &#8220;address the increased burglaries of rural homes, ranches and hunting camps in remote areas along the Texas-Mexico border&#8221; wasn&rsquo;t the whole story.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&rsquo;re really worried about&#8221; is the spillover of the drug cartel violence in northern Mexico, he said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s what the governor doesn&rsquo;t want coming over here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson declined to release any information regarding the placement or number of what he characterized as &#8220;outdoor SWAT teams,&#8221; but said they were trained and equipped for &#8220;nighttime domination.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;We want (smugglers) to be fearful that anytime they come over they could be running into a team,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Despite thousands of killings south of the Rio Grande, spillover violence has been minimal. The vast majority of American deaths in the drug war have occurred in Mexico. </p>

		<p>First off, I think there is violence.  I have heard stories of ranchers and farmers whose property is near the border having to sleep with shotguns.</p>
<p>But even if there were no violence, the Texas Rangers (and the 101st Airborne) should still be at the border, because this is the United States of America, not Mexico.  &#8220;Where there is a Mexican, there is Mexico.&#8221;   &mdash;   Vincente Fox</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s nobody we can get in as pres of any party that will protect the border.  Bush was just as bad as this &#8220;Reconquista&#8221; in the Obama administration, so what good does it do to criticize his obvious bias and racism when we have white idiots who act as useful idiots for them?</p>
<p>Our only hope is in a complete economic collapse, so these wretched peons will have to stay home and straighten out their own country.</p>

<p><b>&hellip;because he stopped them from attacking him.</b> Seriously, some of these reporters are just too inane for words.  Nine illegals are picking apart your house and your truck?  If you&rsquo;re not armed, it&rsquo;ll GET violent.  What&rsquo;s to stop them from making you a pinata? </p>

		<p>Yep, just another irrational spasm of bigotry from the U.S.A. </p>
<p>Why else would we send elite police forces to patrol a violent, lawless border which narco-gangs cross daily. Just more mean spirited racism directed at our good neighbor to the south I guess. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t believe for one second that the violence is not as bad as they say, it is WAY worse!   Though the MSM doesn&rsquo;t tell us the truth of what is going on, sometimes you can hear it &#8220;in the wind&#8221;.</p>

		<p>You know, this reminds me of an incident I experienced several years ago. My husband was involved in a car crash at an intersection that nearly took his life. I found out later that this intersection was the cause of much complaint and debate, because the people wanted a traffic light installed, but the city was resistant because of the cost.</p>
<p>While talking to the officer who was on scene at my husbands accident so I could find out what happened, I jokingly ask him what it would take to get a traffic light, a certain number of fatalities? To my astonishment, his answer was yes.</p>
<p>Now, if you know there is a potential for danger and death, why in the world wait to prevent it? Why not be proactive before the violence gets out of hand on our borders?</p>
<p>BTW, one month later, there was yet another accident at this same intersection, and the poor lady died. There is now a traffic light at this intersection.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Illegals haven&rsquo;t killed anyone yet, so what&rsquo;s the worry?</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t that have read &#8220;at least within the last few hours, anyway&#8221;?</p>
<p>The record of killings (without even including DWI fatalities by illegal aliens over the last 20 years can only be called &#8220;horrendous.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Correction: Illegals have killed many. Drunk illegal drivers have killed dozens of Americans across the country, they&rsquo;ve filled our prisons with gang violence, and they&rsquo;re not far from killing what&rsquo;s left of the American Spirit, and that kills our country.</p>

		<p>Trevino, huh?  This elected sheriff does not want the Rangers.  Why not?  Could it be that he wants more Mexicans in his county?</p>

		<p>The kicker is those ranchers and farmers &#8220;who have to sleep with shotguns handy&#8221; are themselves not above hiring illegal aliens. So go figure that one out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what in hell this country is coming to. Been watching the History Channel drivel about Nostradumus and the Mayan Calendar in agreement&hellip; that the whole shebang will end in 2012 Given the sorry state of the world our liberals have caused, that just might not be all that bad a thing.</p>
<p>Seriously, glad to see friend Shawn, the Female posting again. Have not seen her stuff in a horse&rsquo;s age. But admittedly have been lax myself, reading AND posting.</p>
<p>Let me urge you all to log onto NEWSVINE.COM and get active. Let the liberal fools hear OUR side of reality. Just don&rsquo;t come on too strong or you&rsquo;ll be banned! Also KHOU.COM (local news blog site). Register and get your comments on. Let our Liberal Fools in Houston hear that a lot of us still think with our brains, and reject the liberal dogma out of hand.</p>

		<p>We can&rsquo;t have Texas law enforcement agencies enforcing the law in Texas. Next we&rsquo;ll hear the US government wants to control the borders of the USA. Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous.</p>
