			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The most influential Muslim leader in the West Midlands urged his followers to &#8216;vent their feelings&rsquo; against Right-wing protesters during a Birmingham rally that ended in violent clashes and 90 arrests.</p>
<p>Birmingham Central Mosque chairman Dr Mohammad Naseem encouraged Muslims to counter-demonstrate during Saturday&rsquo;s anti-Islamic protest by the English Defence League (EDL).</p>
<p>The police had advised community leaders to stop people from attending, reported The Times.</p>
<p>But Dr Naseem said it is not his place to discourage his followers from attending protests: &#8216;The thing is, that is their right, I cannot say, &#8220;You don&rsquo;t have this right.&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Troubled flared as the two groups of protesters clashed in the New Street area of the city centre, close to the main train station.</p>
<p>Terrified shoppers looked on in horror as gangs of men and youths hurled bottles at one another and pelted riot police with bricks.</p>
<p>Dr Naseem said that Muslims were instructed to not attend the rally alone but to team up with other counter-demonstrators including socialist and other religious groups.</p>
<p>He added that he had been assured by police that the EDL protesters and counter-protesters would gather in separate locations.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;If it was kept as originally intended, then everybody would have had a chance to give vent to their feelings without coming into contact with each other. And that I will take up with the police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last month there were also clashes when the English Defence League  &mdash;  formed after British soldiers were abused by Islamic radicals at a homecoming parade in Luton  &mdash;  held a rally on the same day as the Unite Against Fascism group.</p>
<p>The latest disorder involved around 200 people and spilled on to Bennetts Hill, a street popular with shoppers and lined with a number of pubs.</p>
<p>English Defence League marchers were involved in running disturbances which lasted all afternoon before the Right-wing protesters were taken to another part of the city by bus.</p>
<p>Witnesses claimed the English Defence League marchers, many of whom had been drinking since the morning, ripped up seats on the journey away from the city centre.</p>
<p>But some members slipped away from the police, clashing with more than 30 socialist protesters amid cries of &#8216;Racist scum, out of Brum&rsquo;. After an hour of angry skirmishes in the city centre, the situation deteriorated further after a group of Asian men also joined in.</p>
<p>Sarah Edwards had to duck into a cafe to avoid being caught in the violence.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;We suddenly saw what seemed to be about 200 Asian men running down the street, throwing bricks.</p>
<p>&#8216;They had bandanas over their faces and were shouting and screaming. We were so scared, we feared for our lives and had to run into the cafe so we wouldn&rsquo;t get hurt. It is so shocking to see this on our streets&rsquo;</p>
<p>The English Defence League has claimed it is not racist, even saying it did not want any violence to happen at the pre-planned protest.</p>
<p>One protester from the league, Leisha Brookes, 42, said: &#8216;We are simply protesting about the fact that if people come to our country, they should respect our laws.</p>
<p>&#8216;If an English person went to an Arab country they would be expected to dress appropriately, and all we are asking is for them to do the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The league has planned protest marches in other cities, including one next month in Manchester.</p>
<p>Yesterday a West Midlands Police spokesman said all those arrested were male, aged between 16 and 39, and offences included criminal damage and violent disorder, including possession of an offensive weapon.</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;A number of fixed penalty notices have been issued while the remainder have been bailed while further enquiries take place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Birmingham City Council last night praised the police for &#8216;successfully&rsquo; managing the event.</p>
<p>But Labour MP Khalid Mahmood accused police of failing to prevent the riots.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;Police have had four weeks to plan for this but they have failed innocent members of the public in Birmingham city centre.</p>
<p>&#8216;It has been a complete mess in terms of policing. The force needs to look at things at the highest level.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Birmingham was England&rsquo;s first majority-minority city. Whites are a minority in Birmingham. It&rsquo;s funny how this is written up as if they are not. </p>

<p><br>
Yes this is true, but this just means the BNP does not do street protests, street confrontations. It doesn&rsquo;t mean others can step up and give it a go.</p>
<p>I like the idea of White English taking to the streets and not always being polite, waiting for elections. </p>
<p>Any Whites anywhere in the world who put their bodies, health, job security on the line and stand up for our people, our culture - they should have our respect and if any ever get any good at it, they should have our support.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even care if the EDL issues statements saying &#8220;they aren&rsquo;t racist&#8221; - whatever. The nasty, ugly, racially alien, culturally alien Paki Muslims will still attack them and any Whites that happen to be in the area.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping the EDL grows and gives a good show of strength in the English streets - this is happening in England.</p>

<p>Of course, the Islamists didn&rsquo;t feel compelled to deny they were racist or anti-British&hellip;which, of course, they are.</p>
<p>The English authorities are bigger wimps than we have over here.</p>

		<p>Naturally the left, as a standard tactic, wants to label as &#8220;extreme right wing fascists&#8221; and &#8220;racists&#8221; any defenders of England&rsquo;s laws against militant Islamic domination &amp; intimidation. The press as usual won&rsquo;t give a hint of who the  real fascists are: the mindless minions of Muhammad&rsquo;s supremacist cult who seek domination of the entire West under oppressive Sharia.   </p>

		<p>The EDL is a pro-multiracial, anti-nationalist group.  They are like the GOP.  Many of the &#8220;anti-jihad&#8221; groups in Europe are like that.  They should get no support from us.</p>
