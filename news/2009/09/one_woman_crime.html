			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AAP, Sept. 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A New Zealand-born woman, dubbed a one-woman crime wave after committing dozens of offences across Sydney, has been deported to her homeland.</p>
<p>Patricia Carol Toia, 31, made the trip across the Tasman aboard a chartered jet on September 10 after commercial airlines refused to have her on board.</p>
<p>Toia, a drug addict, has been sentenced to jail terms on 30 occasions for offences including robbery, assault and dealing in heroin.</p>
<p>In jail she committed another 56 offences including assault, intimidation and damaging and destroying property.</p>
<p>She never held a driver&rsquo;s licence but amassed traffic offences which led to her being banned from taking to Australia&rsquo;s roads until 2060.</p>
<p>Toia came to Australia at the age of one and had lived here all her life. But she fell foul of the good character provisions of the Migration Act. She had not taken up Australian citizenship.</p>
<p>She lost an appeal to the Federal Court on June 30 but chose not to lodge a final appeal to the High Court.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Chris Evans declined to intervene in her case.</p>
<p>&#8220;As there was no impediment to her removal from Australia, arrangements were made to organise her removal,&#8221; a spokeswoman for the Immigration Department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was removed via a charter flight aircraft because airlines indicated that they were unwilling to carry her on a commercial flight.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was accompanied by three security officers and two departmental officials.</p>
<p>The cost of the flight has been put at between $30,000 and $40,000.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said that was comparable to the cost of deportation aboard a commercial flight because of airline requirements for a deportee to be separated from other passengers by a buffer of empty seats.</p>
<p>She said the Immigration Department could not comment on Toia&rsquo;s criminal conduct in Australia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suffice it to say she has a long history of petty crime,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In a hearing before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 2007, deputy president Julian Block noted that the description of Toia as a one-woman crime wave was by no means inapt.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a threat to the Australian community and Australia deserves protection against her, given that the risk of recidivism is, as must be obvious, very substantial indeed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Toia had argued against deportation on the grounds that she had lived all her life in Australia.<br>

		<p>Patricia is not the only one that should be deported. Most of our crime in Australia is cuased by Islanders, blacks, asians and muslims and the white man gets to foot the bill. We have Labor Govts. at Federal and State levels and they suffer from severe political correctness and are bound by their stupidity and unable to see the decaying melting pot which is a total failed experiment. We are seeing chosen segregation as most whites prefer to live with other whites as they are sick and tired of accommodating the uncivilised. The media is full of these stories and the vast mjority of perpetrators are non-white, does that make me a racist because I do not wish to live with criminals, rapists, drug dealers and gangs? </p>

<p>I laughed when I read this. Given Toia&rsquo;s lack of a driver&rsquo;s license and total disregard for laws, I wonder what made them think that banning her from driving would work?</p>

		<p>Apart from Somalians, Sudanese, Middle Easterners, and Vietnamese, Pacific Islanders have created a major crime problem here in Australia.</p>

		<p>In Australia, the cost to register your car and get license plates is high, but that cost includes liability insurance over the term of the registration.  In other words, the car doesn&rsquo;t get on public roads unless the primary driver has liability insurance, any other insurance beyond strict liability you have to buy yourself privately.  This wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad system to adopt in the United States.  However, was driving an unregistered car one of her offenses?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been an education to read about the bad behavior of the Maori and other Polynesians.  Given their amazing accomplishments in navigation with limited resources, which must have required some degree of intelligence, one would expect better of them.</p>

		<p>I totally concur with Nick the Aussie.  This type of behaviour has gone on and on here in Australia for decades now and it always seems that the hard working white Aussie has to foot the bill.</p>
<p>The Corporate and Mainstream media have a lot to answer for, in the way that they have demonised the common white Aussie, for crimes that the Islanders, Muslims, Asians etc commit.</p>
<p>Cronulla was a good example.  The Corporate media portrayed the common white Aussie male as the perpetrator behind the riots, when all it took, was to travel to Cronulla and speak with some of the locals, (even the elderly) or do a little research on the Internet, to know better.</p>
<p>The Corporate and Mainstream media, need to be held accountable, for their part in the ongoing downfall of our good country, Australia.</p>

		<p>They must have a statute in Australia similar to Canada&rsquo;s &#8220;dangerous offender&#8221; clause, which can allow authorities to <b>imprison someone indefinitely</b> until a judge decides they are no longer a risk to others.  With a woman like this, that could take decades of imprisonment, but it&rsquo;s completely legal. </p>

		<p>Good character provisions for immigrants? I wish the U.S. had the will to enact similar provisions. </p>
