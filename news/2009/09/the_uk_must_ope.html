			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Allen, Daily Mail (London), September 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain must sign up to an agreement that would open its borders to anyone travelling from Europe without a passport or visa, the mayor of Calais has insisted.</p>
<p>As riot police began tearing down another illegal camp in Calais, the French authorities admitted yesterday they are fighting a losing battle against migrants desperate to reach the UK.</p>
<p>Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has placed the blame squarely on Britain for not signing up to the Schengen agreement.</p>
<p>Armed officers carrying flame throwers, stun guns and tear gas grenades cleared dozens of makeshift shelters from wasteland close to the Calais town hall yesterday.</p>
<p>The operation came a week after the infamous Jungle camp was bulldozed and 278 men, mainly young Afghanistanis, were arrested.</p>
<p>Most of those had already been freed on human rights grounds.</p>
<p>Ms Bouchart has slammed Britain for being being &#8216;unable to control its own borders&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Calais has become a no-go area and that&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;ve become hostages of the British government,&rsquo; said Mrs Bouchart, a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s ruling UMP Party.</p>
<p>&#8216;Britain is unable to control its own borders, so we&rsquo;re doing the job for them because they&rsquo;re not part of Schengen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Schengen Agreement allows anyone to travel between designated EU states without passports or visas. Mrs Bouchart insisted the British should sign up to it.</p>
<p>Pierre de Bousquet, Prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region, insisted the main target yesterday was people smugglers who charge up to Â£1,000 a time to get migrants into Britain.</p>
<p>&#8216;For months, we&rsquo;ve been hitting the smuggling rings hard and we&rsquo;re now organising at least one operation a week with great efficiency,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>At least 20 new mini-camps have appeared around Calais since the destruction of the Jungle, which at one stage housed as many as 800 migrants.</p>
<p>Britain has called on the French to improve security around the Calais area, where some 2,000 migrants are still sleeping rough.</p>
<p>But as she supervised the dismantling of the Jungle camp, an angry Mrs Bouchart said: &#8216;Great Britain has no right to put pressure on us.</p>
<p>&#8216;They&rsquo;ve imposed this situation on us. Every politician should keep repeating this on every single occasion.</p>
<p>&#8216;The more they say it, the more they&rsquo;ll be throwing light on the problem which has been imposed on it.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>&lsquo;Britain is unable to control its own borders, so we&rsquo;re doing the job for them because they&rsquo;re not part of Schengen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No, Britain is able to somewhat control it&rsquo;s borders, thats&rsquo; why these &#8220;refugees&#8221; are stuck outside of Britains borders.<br>
The problem is that France is unable to control her borders.</p>
<p>If they are unable to get into Britain legally, then that is most likely because they should have been unable to get into France legally. And if they are unable to get into a country legally, they should be expulsed from that country.</p>
<p>So it is not a british problem, it is a french problem, but the french are unwilling to deal with it, and prefer to blame it on the british.</p>
<p><br>
Sweden has the same problem with Denmark, danish border agents simply wave illegal immigrants through, since they know they are on the way to Sweden, and won&rsquo;t be their problem.</p>

		<p>Actually, Britian is trying to control its borders.  It is France that is failing at their southern border.  Obviously, this is exactly why Britian does not want to be part of Schengen.  </p>

		<p>In other words, the French can&rsquo;t (i.e. don&rsquo;t want to) solve the problem, so they want to dump it off on the UK.  This is similar to saying that the American immigration system is &#8220;broken&#8221; such that we need to pass amnesty.</p>
<p>France could solve the problem:  Elect Jean Marie LePen, withdraw from the EU and deport the squatters to their real countries of origin.</p>

<p>So typical.   As usual, it&rsquo;s whites accusing each other and  fighting amongst themselves, diverting their energies away  from the real problem    &mdash;   which is the unwelcome aliens who are invading BOTH of them.  Meanwhile, the sainted &#8220;refugees&#8221; are above all criticism and nothing can be done about THEM.   No one dares even try. It would be political suicide.</p>
<p>Unsurprising!  During  the past half century, powerful groups have put &#8220;refugees&#8221; and &#8220;immigrants&#8221; on a pedestal and these have become some of our new  holy words   &mdash;   just as &#8220;racists&rsquo; and &#8220;xenophobes&#8221;  have become evil words.   </p>
<p>Especially since 1965  (everywhere) those who advocate more immigration and promote open borders have triumphed in their goal of assailing, weakening, and diluting  all white nations.  Our culture  (that of the whole Western World)  has been cunningly manipulated.   It&rsquo;s no accident that &#8220;refugees&#8221; are now a holy class.   This has all been MADE to happen.  </p>
<p>There was virtually no resistance offered from us.  While they were waging a subtle cultural war against us, we were not even aware of it. Now we wake up and look around and wonder what happened! We see that everywhere we are being reduced, disempowered, and outnumbered. Many cannot understand why. So we squabble among ourselves, trading accusations.  Meanwhile, the sacred &#8220;refugees&#8221; don&rsquo;t go away. They bide their time and await their entry.</p>

<p>No, the French government just refused to  control its&rsquo; borders and are at fault for allowing this. When these migrants entered, France should have deported them just like they would any American who was without a passport. I recently traveled over the pond to the UK and France recently. Upon entering France, I had to present passport coming and going or I wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to enter.  Governments have a duty to control their borders. It&rsquo;s no different here in the USA, our government makes all foreingers present a passport and be fingerprinted(to combat terrorism) yet leaves the Mexican border wide open and wants amnesty. It&rsquo;s kind of like locking the front door of your house so strangers can&rsquo;t enter but leaving the back door wide open.</p>

<p>These people are illegal aliens.  They should be arrested on sight and held in custody awaitng swift removal from Europe.  </p>
<p>Anything less encourages others to attempt entry.</p>

<p>Britain is controlling her borders and as such is being accused on not being able to control her borders.</p>

		<p>Put them on ships.  Take them to their home ports and leave &#8216;em where they belong.  If the nation of origin refuses you simply steam out aways, put them in life boats and then sail off for home.  They will either paddle the life boats home or their homey&rsquo;s can pick them up.  Either way it is not the UK&rsquo;s problem.  If they showed a little back bone and arrested all illegals and stopped all refugee programs (except for whites from abandoned African colonies for whom the UK has a moral obligation) the third world would pick on someone else.</p>
<p>Or, if someone is an illegal alien you arrest them.  After making absolutely sure they are infact illeagal you hold public hangings.  No deportation. No trial.  Just a hanging.  Public floggings work in Singapore to keep crime low.  Illegals should have NO legal rights in the country they invaded.  The only exception to hanging would be if the country of origin agreed to take them back immediately.  Cruel, yes.  Would it prevent all illegals? No, but it would sure cut down on the number trying.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget a great many of these illegal immigrants are young, surly, single men.</p>
<p>Unless they take a solemn vow of chastity European women (not to mention the rest of Europe) are going to be in trouble.</p>

<p>Duh, any immigration system, including, our own immigration system is &ldquo;broken&rdquo; if it results in any immigrant experiencing even a momentary delay in obtaining full fledged citizenship and the full cornucopia of welfare benefits available in the modern western social democracy. </p>
<p>Government&rsquo;s sole role in the immigration process is to as quickly and expediently possible grant full fledged citizenship rights to as many third world immigrants you can find and bestow upon those immigrants the most extravagant benefits imaginable with the minimal level of inconvenience or hassle to the immigrant.  Thus when everyone is instantly legal than you can&rsquo;t possibly have an immigration problem!</p>
<p>That is pretty much the bare minimum really, though the truly enlightened thing to do is scour Africa  entire tribes and indigenous societies who have backed the wrong side in various civil wars and import them en mass to the whitest communities available. </p>

		<p>The French welfare and refugee resettlement benefits are just as good as the British.  Does anyone know why these so called refugees want so desparately want to get to Britian?</p>
<p>My guess is the fact that there are very large networks of Muslim terrorists in Britian and the political correctitude of the craven British means that Muslim terrorists are free to plot their schemes.  </p>
<p>When Muslim terrorists are arrested in Britian riots are threatened, the benefit King imans and mullahs get involved, Trevor Phillips and the BBC defend the terrorists and they are freed.  The police and investigators who arrest the terrorists are lucky not to be charged with racism and hate crime.</p>
<p>The French criminal justice system is much stronger than the British.  The French police are not yet totally crippled by political correctness.</p>
<p>One last thought, why are IRA terrorists treated so differently from Muslim terrorists by British law enforcement?</p>

Not so, Madame Bouchart!  In this case, it is France which has not controlled its borders.   Otherwise, how did these people get into France in the first place? </p>

		<p>Why should Great Britain allow a few hundred illegal Afghan squatters to dictate their foreign policy? They shouldn&rsquo;t. If France loves squatters so much, she can make them citizens of France. They&rsquo;ll fit right in.</p>

		<p>It seems that each nation is willing to tolerate illegal aliens and temporary squatters   &mdash;   just so long as they are only passing through and will be dumped on their neighbors instead.  This is very short-sighted, as it will affect all of them in the long run.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like dumping your garbage over the fence. But meanwhile, your neighbor dumps HIS garbage over YOUR fence!  Is this any kind of sensible solution?</p>
