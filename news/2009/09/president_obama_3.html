<h1>President Obama, Race and the Unpatriotic Right</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeremy Levitt, Orlando Sentinel, September 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The far right and its right-wing brethren&rsquo;s most recent barrage of indignant and visceral attacks against President Barack Hussein Obama has led me to conclude that the scourge of anti-Obama fanaticism is nothing more than foolish racism masquerading as patriotism and phony Christianity.</p>
<p>{snip}, the far right&rsquo;s central strategy for helping America is to attempt to delegitimize Obama with trailer-park prowess.</p>
<p>Right-wing disdain for the first African-American president is primordially violent and expressed in dishonest, uninformed, racist and unpatriotic rhetoric and demonstration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Certain fanatical people and groups, not worthy of specific mention, recently toted guns at presidential town-hall meetings wearing menacing T-shirts that read: &#8220;It is time to water the tree of liberty.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a symbolically threatening parity [sic] of Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s celebrated call for vigilance: &#8220;The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of tyrants and patriots.&#8221; Regrettably, this dangerously insolent and unpatriotic message was aimed at the leader of the Free World.</p>
<p>A patriot is one who loves, supports and defends his or her nation and loves its citizens, especially the U.S. president. {snip} A patriot honors the U.S. president, irrespective of his or her biases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a close follower of presidential politics, I do not remember another time when an American president was so unpatriotically maligned by Americans, namely, right-wing politicians and media, and the millions of Joe and Judy plumbers who would disown Jesus if they knew he was African, and Obama if he were the Second Coming.</p>
<p>The truth remains that right-wing anti-Obama rhetoric around abortion, health care, education, gun control and foreign policy are cowardly coded smoke screens intended to mask fear and racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Any American family that participates in the far-right campaign against President Obama by, for example, depriving their children of the opportunity to receive apolitical words of wisdom and encouragement from the president and leader of the free world, is unpatriotic.</p>
<p>Is it patriotic to stifle debate with right-wing anti-Obama propaganda when our nation stands in the balance between a broken economy, a controversial war on terrorism, a sick health-care system and an uneducated educational system? {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I would remind the far right what the Apostle Paul wrote, &#8221; &hellip; there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God.&#8221; Hence, Obama is the U.S. president and leader of the Free World because he was appointed by God.</p>

		<p>I would remind the far left that the civil rights movement had to first violate the scripture which required Christians to obey the established authorities first in order for Obama to gain power. Had the scriptures been obeyed, segregation would have continued to this day. </p>
<p>Do not violate a scripture on obedience to authority to gain power, then use that same scripture to force me to accept your authority. </p>

<p>And what if the disdain that many, many Whites now have for Obama (including some Whites who voted for him but have quickly come to regret it) was caused by what Barack the Kenyan stands for, and does, rather than simply the pigmentation of his skin? Had a black journalist like Levitt thought about that possibility?</p>

<p><br>
I think we need to consider whether or not the &#8216;president&rsquo; is patriotic. I have seen nothing in his behavior that indicates that he is anymore or less than a Marxist. If the far right do not wish their children to listen to lies, that is certainly their priviledge. After all they are in the home of the free, at least for now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-wing disdain for the first African-American president is primordially violent and expressed in dishonest, uninformed, racist and unpatriotic rhetoric and demonstration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t he just write in the above paragraph that Obama&rsquo;s critics were &#8220;masquerading as patriotism and pnony Christianity?&#8221;  If they are masquerading what they say as patriotism, how does he conclude in the second paragraph that they express themselves in &#8220;unpatrioitic rhetoric and demonstration?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds contradictory to me and just more of the same black inability to logic and reason competently. </p>
<p>&#8220;And here&rsquo;s another question:  Can anybody tell me how &#8220;disdain&#8221; can be &#8220;primordially violent?&#8221; </p>
<p>Like most blacks who rant he just can&rsquo;t seem to get his point across in a convincing fashion, and the entire piece doesn&rsquo;t have any points, supported by logic or facts to illustrate his complaints.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nonsense.  Sometimes there is a mulatto or two who can get his message across, but this one is so silly he&rsquo;s more apt to turn those who are neutral on the subject against him, than bring advocates to his side.  Of course just being black will get him 100% acceptance from blacks.</p>

		<p>All these blacks expressing utter SHOCK and HORROR and the gall of whites to criticize THE PRESIDENT, seem to have all have a tad bit of the amnesia, considering Obama just succeeded two consecutive disaster presidents who were among the most mocked, disrespected, and buffoonish world leaders to ever walk the earth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d sooo love to ask this guy if George W Bush was appointed by god? If he admitts it without blanching I&rsquo;d donate a month&rsquo;s salary to Louis Farrakhan. Or are only black leader appointed by God? Whities are appointed by the Devil perhaps?</p>

<p>Hopefully, Levitt will never write for Webster. This is his &#8220;embellished&#8221; definition, and he is trying to pass it off as official. He needed to stop after the word &#8220;nation.&#8221; I am a patriot; I do not love citizens who are trying to destroy my nation. Neither do I honor any president who does the same. The phrase &#8220;especially the U.S. president&#8221; bothers me most of all. Liberals are constantly holding their messiah above all American citizens. It is not Levitts job to define the word &#8220;patriot&#8221; for ME! Don&rsquo;t tread on me, Levitt! I can see right through your garbage, and I only hope that you do not consider your sorry self a patriot, because you are not!  </p>

<p>In other words, you have to be an Obamabot to be a patriot.</p>
<p>And I lingered all these years under the delusion that &#8220;patriotism&#8221; meant that you were for your country&rsquo;s people and its distinguishing principles, even if the mechanisms of central government was pushing the waters in the wrong direction.  Silly me.</p>

Who is this Prof. Levitt person to be lecturing Americans on what is patriotic, or even on what is Christian???</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be very curious to know just what ethnic strains are in this mulatto.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got some nerve quoting (selectively) from Thomas Jefferson.  Furthermore, (I don&rsquo;t care who wrote it) that &#8220;appointed by God: stuff is some of the worst nonsense I&rsquo;ve ever read.  By that standard, Washington and Jefferson and other makers of the Revolution were not patriots but  traitors.  If you had Stalin, Hitler, or Nero for ruler, they were appointed by God, so  it&rsquo;s your duty to obey and  respect them. That notion is the first step to dictatorship.</p>

I pause from reading Maureen Dowd&rsquo;s thoughtful &#8220;Space Gods from Outer SPACE!&#8221; to note that the paucity of liberal ideology is rubbing Americans raw, that our leader is an Ivy League egghead who can&rsquo;t get the ball to home plate.</p>

		<p>The scripture he is paraphrasing applies first to the ultimate political authority. In America, that authority is The Constitution - all government officials are subordinate to The Constitution. By definition, if an official is violating The Constitution (the ultimate political authority of the land), then it is the duty of the people to oppose that official because he is in opposition to the supreme authority (The Constitution) appointed by God.</p>
<p>The other way of looking at this is that there are several instances recorded in The Bible where God has used despotic rulers to punish the people. Who can look at America and claim that we do not deserve punishment by God?</p>

<p>Does this subordination include the multiple czars recently appointed, and who may have sworn an oath of allegience to the Obamaster? Besides!! I once saw in a safe house in California, a very nicely done HUGE reproduction of the U.S. Constitution and across diagonally was written in large letters &#8220;VOID WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW&#8221; that has ever stuck in my mind.</p>

<p>I love all this jabber about how Jesus was black. This fool goes even further and claims He was African. So let me get this straight: this Jewish Kid from Nazareth, born to a Jewish mother and who likely never set foot in Africa, save maybe for a corner of Egypt in a time when travel was extremely difficult, was African. Sure. Makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>I wonder: was W. also appointed by the Almighty, and therefore worthy of the same unquestioning reverence this dupe demands for Obama? Safe money says no.</p>

<p>Sorry.  I&rsquo;ve got news for you: the Constitution was not appointed by God! It was written by men. Even those men would have been shocked to learn that they were not the real authors, but God was.  Furthermore,  unlike the Koran which claims to be God&rsquo;s word, the Constitution can be amended by men (representing the will of the people).  There is nothing Divine in the Constitution, and it never claimed to be. It is a wise and just document, but it never pretended to be holy or divine. The very idea is preposterous.<br>

		<p>God and Jesus are a crutch for the intellectually weak. Neither exist, there is no invisible sky wizard, but perhaps it&rsquo;s not a bad thing that the lower class believe in it since it probably keeps a chunk of them in line.</p>
<p>The president is a puppet to the bankers. If you think you really effect anything by voting you are only fooling yourself. McCain or Obama, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The same set of people on the back end are getting rich.</p>

<p>Political activist, special espertise in human rights law, African politics, use of force,  etc.  Hmmm. Nothing surprising there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary to think that we have fools like this occupying positions of authority and pontificating to us on how we should be governed.</p>
<p>Just another over-educated moron with a law degree.</p>

		<p>Post #27 - You are missing my point, although I probably did not explain it well. I am speaking from the perspective of one who believes that The Holy Bible is the literal word of God. If you don&rsquo;t believe that, then what I say would not make sense. I understand that, and this post is addressed only to those who believe that The Holy Bible is the literal word of God.</p>
<p>In America, the supreme law of the land is The Constitution. God tells us, through His word in The Bible, that we are to obey legitimate government authorities, and in America, the supreme authority is The Constitution. That does NOT mean that it is a divine document or that it is perfect or flawless. You are correct that it was written by men and can be amended by men. I have probably done a poor job of explaining this, but my main point is that for those of us who try to follow God&rsquo;s commandments, our allegiance is to the <strong>document</strong> that governs the nation - not the <strong>elected official</strong> whose role is to follow that document. If an elected official (such as the President) violates The Constitution, then to that degree, The Bible tells us that we are to go with what The Constitution says, and not what the errant elected official says.</p>

		<p>This guy teaches at Florida A &amp; M, which is an HBCU. So that explains his error of confusing &#8220;parity&#8221; with parody. This man is so wrapped up in Africa, where most people are ruled by a &#8220;Great Tribal Chief&#8221; or a &#8220;President For Life&#8221;, that he expects unquestioned love and loyalty for Obama, from all Americans. That&rsquo;s why he blasphemously proclaims that Obama was &#8220;appointed by God&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sorry mister, but we are citizens of the United States of America, NOT Obama&rsquo;s subjects. If you feel the need to worship a &#8220;president for life&#8221;, then I suggest you take the next plane to Zimbabwe, where you can lick Mugabe&rsquo;s boots. You write such drivel from the comfort of your office at a HBCU, where you know you will not be challenged, since Florida A &amp; M&rsquo;s students swallow the jenkem and beg for more.</p>
<p>Do not question the patriotism of men and women who are in harm&rsquo;s way overseas, even now, so that you are free to write such garbage, while we here at Amren are free to criticize it.</p>
<p>To Jupiter (post # 6):</p>
<p>Your last sentence in the above post made me LOL. On YouTube (I forgot the specific link) there&rsquo;s a video of California schoolchildren singing Obama&rsquo;s praises, interspersed with snippets of three North Korean schoolchildren singing the praises of Kim Jong Il. The similarities are striking.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;A patriot is one who loves, supports and defends his or her nation and loves its citizens, especially the U.S. president. {snip} A patriot honors the U.S. president, irrespective of his or her biases.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is confusing Patriot (Like Jefferson) with Loyalist (like Benedict Arnold) and would obviously condemn the entire Continental Congress for failing to be good Patriotic Subjects of ol&rsquo; King George. </p>
<p>A Patriot honors his Convictions, Principals and People. That is why we have the famous line that reads &#8220;We the People of these United States&hellip;&#8221; and NOT &#8220;We the Government of these United States&hellip;&#8221;   <br>
Big Difference. He may also do well to remember that No government is legitimate that does not have the consent and support of its citizens.</p>
<p>And this person is a &#8220;distinguished professor of international law at Florida A&M; University College of Law in Orlando&#8221;   and therefore responsible for Teaching this tripe. No wonder America is on the rocks as badly as we are. </p>
<p>It is like we&rsquo;re aboard a ship called &#8216;democracy&rsquo; and our choices for capitan are a deranged madman and a criminal, while our choices for crew have been obviously hand picked and freshly recruited from an asylum for the criminally insane.</p>
