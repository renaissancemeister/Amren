<h1>Trial Lawyers Group Admits Role in Racially Charged Election Flier</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Bousquet and Marc Caputo, St. Petersburg Times, Sept. 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a highly embarrassing mea culpa, Florida&rsquo;s powerful trial lawyer lobby admitted Wednesday that it was behind an ugly race-baiting flier in a recent North Florida Senate election.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morally and politically, it was indefensible,&#8221; said Scott Carruthers, executive director of the Florida Justice Association, the trial bar group, who said its leaders had no knowledge of it. &#8220;I accept full responsibility for not having done everything to stop that piece from going out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flier juxtaposed images of the Black Panthers, President Barack Obama, the Rev. Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam and black marchers holding a large ACORN banner. The caption read: &#8220;Is this the change YOU want to believe in? Violence and intimidation at the voting booth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The admission sheds new light on the growing practice in Florida of electioneering groups known as 527s that transfer large sums of money among each other to buy ads to influence voters while concealing their affiliations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The controversial flier also may have damaged the trial bar&rsquo;s reputation with African-American legislators. Said Rep. Joe Gibbons, a former president of the legislative black caucus: &#8220;An apology won&rsquo;t do.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Armed thugs may try and scare you away from the voting booth,&#8221; read the text of the mailer, a message still volatile in Jacksonville since the 2000 presidential recount. The city was the epicenter of the recent Senate election in which Republican John Thrasher, a former House speaker, overcame a barrage of trial-lawyer attacks to defeat three rivals.</p>
<p>The mailer included a tear-off absentee ballot request form and was the trial bar&rsquo;s way of building a pool of persuadable absentee voters through a phony political group. The so-called Conservative Voters&rsquo; Coalition was a 527 political organization acting as a front for the trial bar.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Aug. 21, the mailer&rsquo;s existence was noted on a Jacksonville political blog, triggering an uproar. Tom Edwards, the lawyer whose Conservative Citizens for Justice group paid for it, resigned, calling the piece &#8220;detestable,&#8221; &#8220;appalling&#8221; and &#8220;inappropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trial bar executive director Carruthers said the group&rsquo;s internal process of vetting all political advertising was not followed, including a review by its election-law adviser, attorney Ron Meyer.</p>
<p>Rep. Gibbons, D-Hallandale Beach, said the trial bar&rsquo;s actions are especially damaging, coming at a time when some feel that criticism of Obama&rsquo;s presidency has racial overtones.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s just bad faith,&#8221; Gibbons said. &#8220;You would like to think nobody would use race, particularly at a time when you have a black president, and you have these hard people out there with all these hard feelings built up. It&rsquo;s an insult to me &hellip; to think that people just trying to win an office would go to those kinds of depths to win is shocking.&#8221;</p>
<p>What was especially embarrassing about the mailer is that trial lawyers overwhelmingly backed Obama&rsquo;s election, and Carruthers personally gave $2,300 to Obama&rsquo;s effort.</p>

		<p>No surprise that sleazy trial lawyers (one of the backbones of the Democratic Party) would be behind a racially-tinged hoax to make conservatives look bad.</p>
<p>Ironically, the &#8220;ugly, race-baiting flier&#8221; is all-too accurate: the ad links Obama w/ACORN and mentions voter intimidation by the Black Panthers. Maybe blacks dislike the flier because the truth hurts.</p>

		<p>To put it simply, nothing is wrong if it helps the Reds.  Bolshevik ends justify any means.  I am not throwing words around carelessly.  The depraved human impulses that fueled Communism remain with us, and &#8220;liberalism&#8221; is their expression.</p>

		<p>Aside from the fact that some think it was racially charged, it turned out to be true in Philadelphia.  Black Panthers did try to intimidate whites from voting.</p>

<p>What the fools of the Bar didn&rsquo;t realize, probably because they&rsquo;re unaware of what the real world is all about, is that their flyer was a VERY EFFECTIVE anti-Obama ad, just the type the opposition wants to get out.</p>
<p>How apropos to have all these criminals and anti-white haters being connected to Obama.  It accurately describes what many are trying to get across every day.  Beautiful.</p>
<p>If they were a more aware group that understood the situation better, they would realize how much they are helping their opponents.</p>
<p>Typical liberals, thinking that normal, sane people are going to be outraged at the comparisons to Obama when the comparisons are right on.  They&rsquo;re so accustomed to talking only to other Kool Aid drinkers they are disconnected with the real world.</p>
<p>And it was leftist radical Mr. Barne&rsquo;s St. Petersburg Times that ignorantly allowed the truthful depiction.  </p>

<i>&ldquo;Morally and politically, it was indefensible,&rdquo; said Scott Carruthers</i></p>
<p>Just like everyone who is caught committing a hate crime hoax, Mr. Carruthers is sorry.</p>
<p>He and everyone involved should be prosecuted but they won&rsquo;t. For a liberal hoaxer, sorry is always good enough.</p>

		<p>Mr. Ranger is so right.  Liberals live in their own dream world and in this case are too clever by half.  This tasteful, intelligent, and truthful ad is a powerful persuader to vote Republican.  This ad is a winner.  But it is also racists.</p>
<p>There are two levels to advertising material:  They sell the product overtly while the hidden persuaders sell something totally different covertly.  A traditional ad for a new car overtly says buys this great car, but on the unconscious, covert level says you will buy sex with a good looking woman.  Most ads today have added a new element in addition to buying good sex; they say buy good multicultural / diversity covertly.    </p>
<p>The liberal anti-white crowd is so brain washed by their own propaganda that they can&rsquo;t see it as a winner.  You can see their thinking:  Republicans are racists and fear to be known as such.  So we&rsquo;ll make a good overt ad that the typical Republican would make if only he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of being caught as racist <i>in flagranti delicto</i>. </p>
<p>The overt level is vote Republican, but the hidden meaning is Republicans are racists.  But does it work.  A MacDonald ad that says overtly that its food is great and half priced, but says covertly that whites enjoy the company of minorities is still going to sell its hamburgers.</p>
<p>Republicans won&rsquo;t wise up and sell their good hamburgers because that party is run by the same anti-white corrupt elites that run the Democrat Party.<br>

<p>Spot on and herein lies the white dilemma when it comes to reestablishing and holding on to white representation at the political and judicial levels which hitherto had been the natural order of things for centuries.</p>
<p>Communism (in the guise of Socialism) has indeed been let slip through the net in spite of the long McCarthyite struggle to keep it out.</p>
<p>It, like all dictatorial systems is destined to collapse, but in the above case, in far less time than it took to happen in the former USSR <b>because</b> Muslims have also been accorded legislated exclusive immunity from general criticism.<br>

		<p>More proof the left is self-destructing and have absolutely no fear of any kind of backlash. If a conservative were to pull this kind of stunt, somewhere, somehow or another a prosecutor or law enforcement official would find at least a half dozen felonies had been committed. </p>

		<p>Hussein O failed to prosecute an obvious Black Panther Party intimidation incident in Philadelphia. Hussein O has frequently had the opportunity to distance himself from Calypso Louie and has not done so. He used to organize and advise for ACORN and ACORN worked extra hard ( can you say voter fraud? ) for Hussein&rsquo;s election. So what exactly IS the problem with the flier?</p>

<p>&ldquo;An apology won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; <br>
(Let me guess: this time, it&rsquo;s going to take MONEY.)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Armed thugs may try and scare you away from the voting booth,&rsquo; read the text of the mailer.&#8221;<br>
