			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lori Pilger, Lincoln Journal Star, Sept. 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former football coach was sentenced Tuesday to a year in jail for making racially charged threats to employees at Ameritas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very clearly what stands out in this case is Jose Jefferson made a big mistake,&#8221; said his attorney, David Watermeier, who sought probation for his client.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Watermeier said an anonymous letter showed up on Jefferson&rsquo;s desk at Ameritas, where he worked as a licensed insurance broker. When he tried to find out who sent it, the attorney said, he was rebuked.</p>
<p>Watermeier said co-workers resented that Jefferson had been hired through a friend and considered him less qualified.</p>
<p>Jefferson admitted writing two letters in response that threatened death to all blacks and said one who worked there would be killed on a date in February.</p>
<p>Ameritas gave black employees the option of not coming to work for two days, police said.</p>
<p>In March, police arrested Jefferson and Christina Donald, who has admitted helping write the letters. She is awaiting sentencing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In court Tuesday, he said he was neither proud nor happy about what he did, but that he had felt wronged and the situation engulfed him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I let the actions of others provoke me,&#8221; Jefferson said. &#8220;But two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deputy Lancaster County Attorney Holly Parsley said racism always adds stress and tension. That Jefferson was part of the race he targeted didn&rsquo;t mitigate things, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not just a mistake or a bad mistake. It&rsquo;s criminal behavior,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>District Judge Karen Flowers said she lost sleep over what sentence to give Jefferson, but her decision came down to considering the deterrent effect jail time would have not only on him but others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your actions hit right into the things that scare people the most, Mr. Jefferson,&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jefferson coached at Lincoln High School in 2005, leaving in spring 2006. He was an assistant at Nebraska Wesleyan University and Midland Lutheran College and head coach of the Lincoln Capitols and Lincoln Lightning indoor pro football teams.<br/>

<p>This is a characteristic of African-Americans   &mdash;   their bad behaviors are never their fault, but always the fault of others   &mdash;   usually Whites.  This is why it is impossible to reason with Blacks, and why a great many Blacks fail in life.  It is also part of the reason why Whites and Blacks cannot live together.  They are simply too different!  Whites believe that each individual is responsible for their own good or bad behavior.  Blacks believe that their bad behavior is caused by Whites or &#8220;the Man&#8221; or the &#8220;System.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Seems that blacks are coming apart at the seams. Their lunacy is escalating at a rate even beyond what I expected of them, and just what does Jefferson being a former football coach have to do with anything?</p>

<p>This story makes no sense to me.  I also read the original article.  Either I&rsquo;m mentally slow, the reporter&rsquo;s incompetent, or the story&rsquo;s so strange it can&rsquo;t be explained briefly.  Maybe all of the above.</p>

Why lose sleep? Throw the book at the punk. He was completely hoping a white would get wrongly accused and jailed for a crime that he created.  </p>

		<p>Cousin Charlie, you&rsquo;re not the only one who could not make sense of the story.  It&rsquo;s horribly written, but typical of newspaper articles.  Just as Russian factories used to make &#8216;Anti-Products&rsquo; (such as air conditioners that didn&rsquo;t cool), newspapers have, for as long as I&rsquo;ve been reading, produced this sort of &#8216;Anti-Article&rsquo;, or &#8216;Anti-Information&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;ve gotten more useful information on American politics from decorating magazines, than from newspapers, history books, or TV.  Prior to the Internet, bits from House &amp; Garden informed me of the true scope of Japanese WWII atrocities, and Joseph Kennedy&rsquo;s Nazi affinities (oh, and Russian &#8216;Anti-Products&rsquo;).  Reading MSM newspapers is like trying to unscramble the ramblings of some schizophrenic.  Why bother?</p>

		<p>An honest man at least. Most just resort to slander or sneaky underhanded tactics like filing racism complaints with HR (which are kept anonymous of course).</p>

		<p>I wonder if the woman who helped him was white. Anybody know her race? Lincoln, Nebr. has had a problem with blacks for a long time, especially the football players.  </p>

		<p>The article has probably been edited to read &#8220;poorly&#8221; on purpose. This seems to be happening more and more. What I mean is that the &#8216;facts&rsquo; are still in the story, but in leaving out a sentence here and there that provides explanation, the paper is able to have a story about a black faking a hate crime without actually stating that a black faked a hate crime. Think about it. The LA Times does it here in L.A. all the time. Usually with a bit more polish, but toward the same end. </p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s because they have to &#8220;bury the lead&#8221; so that people don&rsquo;t get a racist impression from their articles.  PC clearly rules what&rsquo;s left of the newsroom, at least in the MSM, and when they can&rsquo;t avoid the color of the perp, they at least have to soothe the white readership into thinking that the problem is over and everything&rsquo;s going to be fine. <br/>

		<p>The poorly-written gibberish typified by the original article in this story is a large part of why newspapers in the US are deservedly dying out.  Trash like this and liberal political propaganda masquerading as &#8220;news&#8221; are something many literate former readers are simply unwilling to pay for.</p>
