			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tina Reed, AnnArbor.com, Sept. 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Long before sunrise Wednesday morning, second-year University of Michigan medical student Jess Guh and some of her classmates dragged themselves to Denny&rsquo;s restaurant to grab a bite to eat.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t typically eat that early, but they wanted to get something in their stomachs before fasting for the Muslim observance of Ramadan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the only place that&rsquo;s open at 4 in the morning,&#8221; Guh said.</p>
<p>She and many of her medical school friends aren&rsquo;t Muslim, but as future physicians, they were trying to better understand how annual Ramadan fasting would affect the lives of their Muslim patients.</p>
<p>They were among about 100 students and about a dozen faculty who participated in the Muslim Medical Students Association&rsquo;s Fast-A-Thon Wednesday. The event encourages members of the medical school community to try to adhere to the traditional fast from eating or drinking anything between dawn to dusk for one day of Ramadan. U-M was one of many campuses across the United States with similar events.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of understanding the science and the physical effects of fasting, that&rsquo;s something we can learn in lecture. Of course, we know what happens to a person&rsquo;s glucose levels when they don&rsquo;t eat for several hours,&#8221; Guh said. &#8220;As a provider, this helps us understand better why it would be important enough for one of our patients to do this.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to adapt to their ways, even though they are in our lands.  How would they like it if we asked them to eat during the day during Ramadan if we &#8220;migrate&#8221; to their countries?  </p>

		<p>I eat three times a day, because I need it, and because I want to be able to do the many things I have to do, to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>Now, if practising Muslims do not eat enough, so that they are not able to attend to their duties well, I think that is their problem, period.</p>
<p>Why should non-Muslim medical students go through something like that? Like, they don&rsquo;t have enough things to do, enough efforts to make, and enough problemes to deal with, already?</p>
<p>If the Muslims choos to practise such a medieval religion, let them deal with the consequences; and let us enjoy our own way of life.</p>
<p>Besides, when their priests, or imams, as they are called, call us «infidels» and the like, it is not like they are doing a lot to understand our own views, are they?</p>

		<p>As a former student at Michigan I can attest to the high moral tone afforded political correctness at this institution. I would like to note that many of the professors and students make the rounds of political correctness to cover their racism and snobbery; Not-In-My-Backyard liberals predominate among Michigan&rsquo;s white students and this dishonesty and duplicity is rife in American universities today because so many students and faculty feel bullied by the PC Overlords of the Ivory Tower. It is so sad when a doctor-in-training has to &#8220;make the rounds&#8221; in this duplicitous way - at least this false-affected &#8220;ramadan&#8221; may help the young doctors understand their patients better who suffer from hypoglycemia, as well as enhance their politically correct credentials so they can appear to have played the game and satisfy their Master&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>These students are not doing enough to show their compassion, understanding, and empathy.  If they were really sincere they would immediately resign from the university and slit their throats.</p>

		<p>So, what is the Univ of Michigan Medical School going to ask its students to do next; participate in a female circumcision. Are they going to be &#8220;more compassionate&#8221; if the wife or daughter of a devout Muslim has been beaten half to death? Will a Muslim doctor be allowed to refuse treatment to someone he/she knows to be a convert from Islam to something else? What about refusing treatment to someone who is a pig farmer, someone who deals in a business that charges interest, or a liquor store owner? Are we going to hear about it in the media if a serviceman is intentionally killed by a Muslim doctor?</p>
<p>Just google some of the stories about the doctors from 3rd world countries that are serving the NHS in Great Britain and you see what is coming down the pike. If you are actually in a Muslim country during ramadan, don&rsquo;t eat or drink in public during sunlight hours. There will be other customs to follow, however you are on their soil. But we are committing national suicide to willingly follow this nonsense here. </p>

		<p>Good grief.  Not eating for 12 hours is hardly a big deal.  Now when are the medical students going to be encouraged to engage in jihad so that they truly understand the essence of Islam?</p>

		<p>I agree, what are moslems doing to understand us?<br>
   If these doctors want to know what fasting was like, they should ask their patients that come in for blood tests. Moslems only have to fast during the day, which is easy in winter. I had to fast for 12 hours for my last blood test. Afterwards, I did not go on a Jihad.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t understand americans, on one hand we are expected to sit back and watch and accept primitive peoples who come to this country and transform it, and always for the worse while at the same time we tend to have a negative reaction when an advanced people (mostly americans) arrive in a primitive country and try to transform/advance that country. It&rsquo;s almost as if the national philosophy is &#8220;if they can become rich like us, we should become poor like them&#8221;</p>

		<p>College must be a strange yet reassuring place for students from the mideast, they learn the establishment back home is absolutely right (tho understated) in their criticism of America and the West. American students are taught how much there is to learn about these foreign students and how much of value they can contribute. Anything less would be stereotyping. Foreign students on the other hand learn how it is whites who are the root of all evil in the world. Past, present and future. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s not how to understand them. The professors should go live in one of their hell holes, get physical, moral, emotional and sexual abuse as a child, listen to angry hate speech all day against Jooos and Christians,  abuse women, watch headchoppings on TV, go to school to learn to recite things they don&rsquo;t understand instead of reading, writing and arithmetic, and generally look forward to a truly miserable life. Then they might understand them. </p>

		<p>Not only is this typical liberal bowing down and bending over to Muslims, it displays total ignorance of the Ramadan fasting rules.</p>
<p>Sick people don&rsquo;t have to fast.  So patients, whether in the hospital, clinic or office don&rsquo;t have to fast.  If these stupid, ignorant, sniveling sobbing liberals bowing down and kissing the feet of multicult had bothered to call up the nearest Islamic center they would have learned that the sick don&rsquo;t have to fast.</p>
<p>Neither do the pregnant, elderly, children or even woman who are menstruating.</p>

		<p>The Ramadan fast began as an imitation of the Jewish Yom Kipper and Christian lenten fasts.  The christian lenten fast permitted eating 3 times a day.  This meant fasting christians could work, travel and do what needed to be done.</p>
<p>The Ramadan fast is not that much of a sacrifice.  In fact, just as we gain weight at Christmas, Muslims generally gain weight at the end of Ramadan.  They fast from dawn to dusk and then feast from dusk to dawn.  It is basically a month long Thanksgiving and Christmas with the big dinners and endless parties.</p>
<p>When Islam began, they handled Ramadan by sleeping during the day and eating all night.  Now they have to contend with the standard 8-5 workday. </p>

		<p>I wonder if any of them have ever done Lenten fasting.  Something from their own tradition.  Maybe Eastern Orthodox fasting, if they want serious fasting and a little exoticism. </p>
<p>Of course interns and many nurses ARE used to fasting.  12 hours or more on the run, and not a bite to eat or bathroom break sometimes.</p>
<p>Just wait till they have a 36 hour shift, with maybe an hour snatched for sleep, and a couple of bolted power bars for meals, and working through an illness of their own. Medicine has plenty of deprivation in store for these future doctors.</p>

		<p>Models and ballet dancers often fast for 3 to 5 days as a regular part of their weight control regimen.</p>
<p>It works too.  Fasting 5 days a month or 2 days a week is the very best way to keep your weight down or lose weight.  </p>
<p>Sensible diets don&rsquo;t work.<br>
Fasting does.</p>

		<p>So, I assume these doctors in training are also going to voluntarily crush their own limbs in a car accident, receive tick bites to contract Lyme Disease, overdose with drugs, cut and shoot each other in a gang fight in order to &#8216;better understand the conditions of their patients&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Now, since turn around is fair play, all the Muslim students must adhere to a traditional Christian Easter dinner on Easter, complete with baked ham.</p>
<p>The world has turned upside down.</p>
