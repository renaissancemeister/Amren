			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Sept. 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Everybody&rsquo;s racist, it seems.</p>
<p>Republican Rep. Joe Wilson? Racist, because he shouted &#8220;You lie!&#8221; at the first black president. Health care protesters, affirmative action supporters? Racist. And Barack Obama? He&rsquo;s the &#8220;Racist in Chief,&#8221; wrote a leader of the recent conservative protest in Washington.</p>
<p>But if everybody&rsquo;s racist, is anyone?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It gets to the point where we don&rsquo;t have a word that we use to call people racist who actually are,&#8221; said John McWhorter, who studies race and language at the conservative Manhattan Institute.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more abstract and the more abusive we get in the way we use the words, then the harder it is to talk about what we originally meant by those terms,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think (Wilson&rsquo;s outburst) is based on racism,&#8221; former President Jimmy Carter said at a town hall meeting. &#8220;There is an inherent feeling among many in this country that an African-American should not be president.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an easy charge to make against the rare individual carrying an &#8220;Obamacare&#8221; sign depicting the president as an African witch doctor with a bone through his nose. But it&rsquo;s almost impossible to prove  &mdash;  or refute  &mdash;  assertions that bias, and not raw politics, fuels opposition to Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to be very careful about going down that road. You&rsquo;ve cried wolf,&#8221; said Sean Wilentz, a Princeton University professor who studies U.S. political and social history.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a way of interpreting the world, where race runs through everything  &mdash;  everything is about race,&#8221; said Wilentz, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2008 and claimed Obama&rsquo;s campaign falsely accused her of stoking racial fears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is not about race,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not Mississippi in 1965 any more. Even in Mississippi it&rsquo;s not Mississippi in 1965 any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Major factor in American life</p>
<p>Still, race remains a major factor in American life, said Brian D. Smedley, director of the health policy institute at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which focuses on people of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know from a large body of social science that a large portion of Americans harbor racial bias,&#8221; Smedley said. &#8220;In the context of health reform, it&rsquo;s quite evident that race plays a very large role in helping shape public opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Manhattan Institute&rsquo;s McWhorter said that during the affirmative action battles of the 1990s, &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; began to be applied to liberal policies designed to redress past discrimination, then were extended to people who believed in those policies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they have come to be wielded against Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mark Williams, one of the leaders of the Sept. 12 rallies in Washington D.C., headlined a blog entry about the arrest of black scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. at his own home by a white police officer, &#8220;Racist In Chief Obama Fanning Flames of Racism.&#8221; And too many bloggers to count are saying that Congressman Jim Clyburn, who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and has called Wilson and other health care protesters racist, is the real racist himself.</p>
<p>Black identity politics</p>
<p>This infinite loop is the inevitable result of years of black identity politics, which created a blueprint for whites who feel threatened by America&rsquo;s changing demographics, says Carol Swain, a Vanderbilt University professor and author of &#8220;The New White Nationalism In America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to rethink what is racist and who can legitimately call whom racist,&#8221; Swain said, citing the argument that blacks can&rsquo;t be racist because racism requires power.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a black president, a black attorney general, and blacks holding various power positions around the country, now might be a time when we can concede that anyone can express attitudes and actions that others can justifiably characterize as racist.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The blacks are more racist than whites, this is a fact proved by Obama himself, all his nominees in goverment are black or non white and the few that are white are gays.</p>
<p>That is why we fear the future or imminent minority status if amnesty for mexicans is granted.</p>
<p>They will never be as generous and civilized as we were, will they give us affirmative action for whites?</p>
<p>I doubt it.<br>

There&rsquo;s a musical called &#8220;Avenue Q&#8221; which is a take-off on Sesame Street (for adults). It includes the song, &#8220;Everyones a little bit racist&#8221;.</p>

		<p>One of the good arguments against the person of Barack H. Obama becoming President was that every opponent and instance of opposition to his agenda would be called racist.  Now we see that the silver lining is that if everybody is, then nobody is.  &#8220;Racism&#8221; is about to fall out of the dictionary.</p>

<p>Well, what is  a &#8220;racist&#8221;?   What does the word mean? <br>
 <br>
It all depends on how you define &#8220;racist&#8221;.<br>
Leftists can bend and twist their definition to make it fit whatever they want it to say.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re defining the terms of the debate, there&rsquo;s no way you can win.</p>
<p>Best just to dump the word completely. Pay it no heed! It was designed as a device to frighten people and keep them under control. And it&rsquo;s proven spectacularly successful thus far. Most people are terrified of it. Politicians and public figures melt to quivering mush at the sound. </p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have to give it any power over us.  The best way to fight it is to ignore it.</p>

		<p>Use the character test for everyone. It works.  Call everyone by name: neutralize color for character.  Language and cultural differences that make individuals unique.  Preference of ones race, culture, language and country should not be confused to be discrimination because all have preference for their own characteristics. We all have race. The core American culture has already been diluted for diversity and the results are before US. Whites lost the culture battle because of ethnic race wars of the 50&rsquo;-60s. It seems whites never do enough to please those who choose to use victimization for political gains.  V</p>

		<p>Whites are amoungst the least racist people out there.  Blacks and Asians lead the list of most racist.  Blacks win because they are completely and loudly vocal about it.  They commit hate crimes against whites yet are never charged with a hate crime.  Their horrible crimes are covered up my the media.  They media REFUSED to report on the Knoxville murders because the victims were white and the crimnials were black. But you better believe the Duke lacrosse &#8216;rape&rsquo; was international, daily and headline news.</p>

		<p>Whites are beginning to demonstrate that the &#8220;pejorative&#8221; and exhausted word, cannot bully people forever. It&rsquo;s abuse by blacks themselves has began to drive the final stake in its heart. Whites should continue to mitigate this crutch through reciprocation. The word has caused enough damage; it is long overdue to be put to rest.     </p>

<p>The left are fans of irony.  Why not throw it back at them?  &#8220;Yes, we&rsquo;ll let you destroy our country and our culture with socialism, open borders, and racial patronage; if only we can keep our precious White House white!&#8221;</p>
<p>The real transition is not just that the left has overused the race card, but that here and there, patriotic White Americans are starting to lose their fear of the &#8220;R-word&#8221; and call it for what it is.</p>

		<p>Racist is nothing but a word for a free pass or used against people that want give in to stupidity. In Congress they have a Black Congressional Caucus and no whites and I believe no one can belong other than a black so what does this tell you. They plot with secret societies in Congress. Also for the last 8 years before Obama every black in Congress railed Bush and made obnoxius and false statements. I am a white person over seventy and I have never been afforded anything because of my color and I resent any that have. Every white in Congress that refuses to stand against the Democrat racist machine is a traitor to America.</p>

		<p> So a racist is someone who believes in the inherent superiority of one race over another? Then how can that be, when top-lofty liberals insist there is &#8220;no such thing as race&#8221;   &mdash;   that it is just a &#8220;social construct&#8221;? If David Letterman or Conan O&rsquo;Brien tells a joke on his show about White people being unable to jump high or run fast, having no &#8220;natural rhythm,&#8221; or all being financially comfortable, and the audience laughs, then is the audience being &#8220;racist&#8221;? Or is the comedian joking about something that doesn&rsquo;t really exist?</p>

<p>Exactly right. Cries of &#8220;racism&#8221; are the Left&rsquo;s Nuclear Option. Even otherwise sensible people would sacrifice their children to Moloch if someone told them that not to do so is &#8220;racist.&#8221; It&rsquo;s only a word, and a particularly meaningless one at that. Let them use their Bad Word; what else have they got? Usually nothing.</p>

		<p>Speaking As a White Advocate, </p>
<p>Whites have let themselves be convinced that it is racist merely to object to dispossession, much less to work for their own interests. Never before has a people been fooled into thinking that there was virtue or nobility in surrendering its heritage, and giving away to others its place in history. Only whites are ever told that a love for their own people is somehow &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; of others.</p>

		<p>The word &#8220;racism&#8221; has been continually changed by the leftists so much, it lost it&rsquo;s once powerful meaning a long time ago. Now maybe everyone, especially whites, will start having more realistic views on forced diversity and integration and the negative effects they have on society.</p>

The same perspective applies to all humans as well, but only whites are faulted for it.  If we are called racists who cares?  Racism is based upon the knowledge that racial differances are far more than skin deep&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve made the point to my friends that if whites don&rsquo;t drop this cringing fear of being labeled &#8220;racist&#8221;, then they may as well hand over their cars, houses, valubables, and even their rights as citizens(which has largely happened)because this word isn&rsquo;t going to disappear soon. It has so often served its purpose, and then some. Uttering the word racism in accusing someone of something, has the same effect as when a hypnotist utters the trigger word that causes the desired response.</p>

Not I friend.<br>
This particular subject has annoyed me for years. Now, granted, my particulars allow me great leeway. I am self-employed in such a fashion that a boycott etc. would not work against me, I live in the west with much better laws than the rest of the country and am far from any population center. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about getting fired for my political views or getting sued from employees.<br>
Do not underestimate the liberation of such a situation, It was an awful lot of hard work, but now I do not have to do, think, or say anything to get along with an employer, employees or others.<br>
However, when in towns on business trips or conversing, blogging etc. I love to let one of the typical types know that I belong to a white only sportsmans club. They immediately scream racism and racist, however, they get very upset and beside themselves when they notice it bothers me not at all.<br>
Most at that point either ignore me (burning up because they either truly can&rsquo;t stand my position or have finally realized that they were supporting it only because they have been forced into it) or they try to make a calm argument against my position.</p>
<p>Either way, the weapon is blunted immediately.</p>

		<p>In the Communist country I lived in, the dreaded word was &#8220;rightist.&#8221; When Communism was still young, everyone lived in fear of that label, and it was often applied even to enthusiastic believers in the Communist Party who had somehow failed to carry out its dictates effectively. The &#8220;rightists&#8221; lost their positions, their prestige, their money, and their freedom. The result was that the ideological fanaticism caused an entire generation to lose faith in the Communist Party and its beliefs. The same is true for the wave of political correctness that swept America in the 1960s. Too many people have been labeled and falsely accused of ideological error. Faith in political correctness will never recover. </p>

		<p>Everyone&rsquo;s a racist today. Whites, blacks, latinos, asians&hellip; they all classify as racists by the political defined use of the word today in society. </p>
<p>What I want to know is how does racism play out amongst our mixed race neighbors. Does the black part of them hate the white part and visa versa? Is the media to hold the white part of a mulatto accountable for what they say but not the black part? Or visa versa if circumstances warrant?</p>

<p>One of Farrakhan&rsquo;s black henchmen said on Geraldo years ago that <b>racism = power plus prejudice</b>.  In his view, and NOT mine, blacks didn&rsquo;t have enough power, therefore nothing they said, no matter how prejudiced, could be racist. </p>
<p>This is the <i> sine qua non</i> behind every multicolored power play in the white world. </p>
<p>However, my generation of whites is finally questioning why we always have to be on the defensive, and why no other race feels ashamed of exercising their prejudices.  I&rsquo;m almost optimistic.</p>

Just a quick note to help you understand the &#8216;brainwashing&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve been subjected to.  Do you?<br>
1. watch TV especially the junk put out by Hollywood.Notice all the PC stuff put into action for you?<br>
2. read MSM newspapers.<br>
3. take note of PC speech..salesperson= salesman, Chairperson=chairman&hellip; &amp; so on. All very slow &amp; very thorough indoctrination.<br>
4. your education in &#8220;outcomes based education&#8221; institutions&hellip;where you are taught to accept all the PC jargon &amp; NOT TO QUESTION OR DEBATE IT.<br>
5. are your kids being taught about &#8216;global warming&rsquo; at school?<br>
 or maybe about the achievements of the African peoples being stolen by the Europeans?</p>
<p>Frightening?? Sure is &amp; all done with your full co-operation.</p>

<p>Unless of course you are including many GOP&rsquo;ers as &#8220;Leftists&#8221; it ain&rsquo;t just the Left who go through mechanizations on race and &#8220;racism&#8221;. Many on the right are also eat up with it.</p>

		<p>The best defense against being called &#8220;racist&#8221; is loud laughter and mockery.  That will throw the lefties for a loop, and will take the sting out of their once-magical word.  Make those who cry &#8220;racist&#8221; into objects of ridicule.<br>

		<p>What I want to know is how does racism play out amongst our mixed race neighbors. Does the black part of them hate the white part and visa versa? Is the media to hold the white part of a mulatto accountable for what they say but not the black part? Or visa versa if circumstances warrant?</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>All the more reason to keep mixed-race people separate and breeding amongst themselves. And we also know what happens when you introduce even a small amount of non-White blood to the genepool. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that simply ignoring accusations of racism and being daubed racist, will work. We mustn&rsquo;t forget that the term is not just a mere psychological battering ram devised and employed by the inventors and disciples of Marxist Liberalism, and universalized with the help of their <b>enabled</b> <i>minority</i> non-white fodder, to batter the white races into the ground with, it&rsquo;s also a physical weapon of oppression as in <i>threat of loss of physical freedom, obstruction of rights to an education, to earn a living and attain property ownership for adults and offspring alike.</i>  In short, rights to ethnic and cultural preservation, and even survival.</p>
<p>No, we must take back the word and restore its correct meaning.  We must also reinstate the naturally-occurring and inherent rights of all peoples to intermingle and procreate amongst themselves, and support the needs and aspirations of <b>their own kind at every juncture, and that includes the inalienable right of permanent and exclusive ownership and possession of ancestral territory.</b> </p>
<p>The still living and descendants of those who have already committed and are currently committing racial and cultural mass genocide against white Europeans, ie, Bolsheviks, Muslims and present-day Marxist Liberal multiculturalists and diversity zealots, have yet to be called to account.  They will be, all in good time.</p>

		<p>Gun Runner, What you said basically illustrates the crisis whites are facing. We are probably the only group that isn&rsquo;t allowed to be proud of our heritage or culture. Quite frankly, if whites want to end their dispossession and increasing marginalization, we must unapologetically fight for white interests and not be worried about being labeled racists. After all, aren&rsquo;t we all racist?</p>

		<p>Since the term &#8220;racist&#8221; has been extended to cover ANYONE daring to voice unpopular but nevertheless, very truthful if negative views on races, I guess I&rsquo;m damned PROUD to be called &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We need to rethink what is racist and who can legitimately call whom racist,&rdquo; Swain said, citing the argument that blacks can&rsquo;t be racist because racism requires power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; This is a good statement to ponder.  Mr. Swain is trying to imply that political power and dominance in the economy in general as well as culture, converts a simple noun to a pejorative, racist term if the person using it is a racial member of the group perceived to be in control.  But power is a slippery thing.  May not an individual have power over another in one on one confrontations?  What if one is black and makes that an issue in the interaction?  The oldest one is &#8220;You won&rsquo;t date me because I am black.&#8221;  So as not to be seen as evil, by even one person, the other is compelled to comply with the demands of the black in the confrontation.  Is that not power?  What about a bully in a classroom, intimidating other students and the teacher?  Is that not power? The power game is far more intricate than Swain proposes and he is playing a game with the idea for political purposes. </p>
<p>What if the culture is overwhelmed by a race not seen as in political and economic power, but that culture has power over young, innocent minds, who are also vulnerable?  Is it possible for a president from a minority group to stack his government with others of his racial group, completing, in practical terms, the overtaking of government by a certain minority racial group and still be seen as the one not in power and so qualify for the further projection of power by labeling any opposition as inherently &#8220;racist?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The best therapist first advice is to tell people to face their fears. If whites just accepted being called a racist and did what they thought was right, an astounding amount of backbone and good would be achieved. </p>

		<p>According to Webster&rsquo;s the word &#8220;racism&#8221; didn&rsquo;t even exist until 1933, so how legitimate can it be?  Prior to 1933 all races knew which races were inherently superior and which were inherently inferior.  This was known as &#8220;common sense&#8221;, because it was determined by every conceivable means humans have of measuring human accomplishments.</p>
<p>Marxist academics coined the word &#8220;racism&#8221; just as they have coined most of the &#8220;ists&#8221; and &#8220;isms&#8221; in a transparent ploy to make themselves appear to be intellectually astute and &#8220;progressive&#8221; in the eyes of the poorly educated lower class people they exploit for political gain&hellip;<br>

		<p>&ldquo;We know from a large body of social science that a large portion of Americans harbor racial bias,&rdquo; Smedley said. &ldquo;In the context of health reform, it&rsquo;s quite evident that race plays a very large role in helping shape public opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ok, for starters, if you can say &#8220;Social Science&#8221; with a straight face&hellip; You may be an idiot. &#8220;Social Science&#8221; is no more science than Psychiatry. There&rsquo;s nothing but theory and supposition. It&rsquo;s mostly assuming the motives of people you&rsquo;ve never met. This is a bitter joke to &#8216;real&rsquo; scientists/engineers. (mostly because we aren&rsquo;t con men&hellip; generally.)</p>
<p>Second, have you ever MET someone who would admit to being named &#8216;Smedley&rsquo;? (I can&rsquo;t even say THAT with a straight face.) I doubt his &#8216;shaped public opinion would be worth much.</p>
