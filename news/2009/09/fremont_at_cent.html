<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;The melting pot&#8221; analogy for immigration has taken on new meaning in this city of 25,000.</p>
<p>It could be said that the heat has been turned up here and that the bubbling contents of the pot are coming apart rather than coming together.</p>
<p>Behind is a summer unity picnic in which Kristin Ostrom, Gabriela &#8220;Gabby&#8221; Ayala and other members of a group called Nebraska Is Home tried to ease the tension between the white population and Hispanics and other relatively new immigrant faces.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ostrom, 47 and a 12-year resident of Fremont, couldn&rsquo;t believe her ears last year as she headed home from a trip to Minnesota. On the radio was live coverage of a marathon public hearing that would eventually lead to the city council&rsquo;s defeat of a crackdown ordinance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was shocked,&#8221; she said during a Wednesday interview at a local coffee shop, &#8220;shocked that it seemed true that a small community where people know each other would be so judgmental of some new people coming in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayala, 26, Mexican immigrant and an 11-year resident of Fremont, said her Hispanic friends feel two ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are the ones that are confident it&rsquo;s not going to happen, and there are the ones that are worried about what might happen,&#8221; Ayala said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a few families that have moved away already,&#8221; she added, &#8220;because they&rsquo;re afraid to go out, afraid to go to the store, because they don&rsquo;t know whether they&rsquo;ll be insulted by somebody, especially with all the anger going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fremont, home to such familiar Nebraska landmarks as Midland College and the Fremont Dinner Train, became a center of attention for less warm and fuzzy reasons last year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when several members of the city council got behind a proposed ordinance that would, among other things, prevent local landlords from renting to people who can&rsquo;t prove legal status in the U.S.</p>
<p>It eventually failed when Mayor Ed &#8220;Skip&#8221; Edwards broke a 4-4 tie by voting against the ordinance.</p>
<p>That led to a successful petition drive, which led to a Dodge County District Court case in which Judge John Samson directed the city to go ahead with an election, which led to an appeal that is now before the Nebraska Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ayala and Ostrom aren&rsquo;t convinced those behind the petition drive represent the majority.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s not a big group,&#8221; Ayala said, &#8220;but it is a loud group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ostrom thinks the ordinance promoters&rsquo; sense of mission is a reaction to a recent change in Fremont&rsquo;s racial makeup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s people being nervous about change,&#8221; she said, &#8220;about new people coming to the community and how that affects jobs and the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of people have talked about how they&rsquo;re offended that they hear people speaking Spanish at Wal-mart,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>The story is typical of the insanity going on in the United States. It boils down to this  &mdash;  illegal aliens are border criminals by definition, and DO NOT BELONG IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s Freemont, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, or pudunk county anywhere U.S.A. That, is the only relevant consideration in this story. All other considerations are nothing more than an attempt to confuse the issue.</p>

		<p> The newspaper&rsquo;s slant on this problem   &mdash;   that is, the rapidly growing presence of Hispanic immigrants who may be or, more likely, probably are, illegal, is typical: To paint the reaction of the native White people in the community as &#8220;the problem.&#8221; The illegal-loving liberals can assume if they want to that those signing the petition don&rsquo;t represent the majority, that they are just &#8220;loud&#8221; and &#8220;afraid of change.&#8221; I suspect it IS the majority which is making its views felt.</p>
<p> And if the federal government were doing its job and policing our borders properly to keep out as many of these illegals as possible, then the local governments wouldn&rsquo;t HAVE to step in as they increasingly are doing. </p>

		<p>Read some of the comments on the discussion tab.  You have one poster calling rural nebraskans &#8220;paranoid hate mongers&#8221; and other posters giving the tireless legal vs. illegal immigration argument.  One even talks about anti-irish laws back in the day.  Well, the Irish may have had their problems, but they shared a common language and race.  Sorry to the naysayers, but that makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for the posters who say as long as they&rsquo;re here legally, it&rsquo;s ok.  No, it&rsquo;s not OK.  Just like Jupiter says, either way, whites are still being replaced in this country.</p>

		<p>The mayor and his city attorney dont want to enforce the law in their own city, its fine for them to wash their hands and wait forever for the feds to do anything about it. Arent these public officials supposed to be doing everything possible to make their cities peaceable and livable? </p>

		<p>sorry for lack of cap&rsquo;s and certain punctuation d/t broken keyboard.</p>
<p>since the first amnesty ronald reagan issued in 1985 of a little over 2 million illegals, a torrent of illegals has flooded into america, fundamentally and permanenly changing our demographic. they are obviously fleeing poverty and dispair in hispanic america. problem is, they bring it with them.<br>
i have been metaphorically preaching for years about this. now we have a real problem. crime has skyrocketted in areas of the american southwest where there never was any before. these rural nebraskans have a very real, legitimate complaint.<br>
for a glimpse into what illegal immigration does to a community, look no further than california. the once land-of-plenty is now bankrupt and crime-ridden. the once-safe streets of l.a. and san fransico are breeding grounds for some of the most aggressive and dangerous species to ever have entered america. <br>
as has been often said&hellip;&#8221;as goes california, so goes the rest of america&#8221;. this used to be used in a positive sense that including changing fashions and fads. now as the white exodus is in full swing and supplanting of anglo culture is occuring full blast, we can forecast the future of the rest of america who has yet to experience the cultural &#8221;richness&#8221; of diversity and its blessings. </p>

<p>And they will blame whites and/or ask whites to help them out.  Hopefully by then, whites will collectively pull their heads out of their butts and stop this problem.  It will be funny watching blacks who have done nothing but antagonize whites, call us racists, force their will on us get what&rsquo;s coming to them from the hispanics.  </p>

		<p>Kristrom Ostrom needs to pay a visit to Los Angeles.  Your nice Mexican friend is only the tip of an iceberg.  The rest of it is a mob of dull-minded, grasping, non-contributing, violent tax consumers.  They have drained California, but even the dregs of White civilization are far better than what they could do for themselves.  And the other aliens are no less threatening.  Even if their murder rates are lower, they&rsquo;re much more grasping.  No non-White immigration is acceptable.<br>

		<p>For starters, as Mark Twain said, &#8220;if you read newspapers, you are misinformed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice, if you read the actual article, that the origin of the &#8220;anti-illegal&#8221; ordinance is carefully missing. This is because it was written by the police department. Not only has Fremonts crime risen and fallen with the hispanic population, they are the major cause of all types of complaints. (Domestic, disorderly, etc.) I noticed MS-13 graffiti on the public boat ramp three years ago and knew this was going to be a problem.</p>
<p>The whole episode is a micro copy of the national immigration debate. Except that liberal idiots are joined by Hormel who buses Mexicans clear from Oaxaca. Don&rsquo;t let these clowns change the subject. This is either legal or it&rsquo;s not. If it&rsquo;s not, then there should be penalties for aiding and abetting.</p>
<p>All of this &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;classist&#8221; garbage is just that&hellip; garbage.</p>

		<p>Whites not wanting to be controlled and overrun by non-whites are being &#8220;hysterical&#8221; and &#8220;nervous about change&#8221;, yet when non-whites are worried about whites controlling them they are &#8220;fighting for justice&#8221; and &#8220;finding against the system/colonialism&#8221;</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re darn right about them being nervous about this type of change. They&rsquo;ve seen what&rsquo;s happened in the rest of the states, and aren&rsquo;t looking forward to be taken over, pushed out and ignored while having to fund it all.</p>

		<p>I would expect  more and more resistance in smaller, white communities since their sattlelite dishs are bringing them news directly, rather than later, and by newspaper rumor.  How might one expect one to react if they are white when CNN is about to run a special called &#8220;Latino in America?&#8221;  It is being preceded by a trailer that frankly claims that whites will be a minority soon.  The subtle message is &#8220;get used to it.&#8221;  And when it comes with the actual removal of the basic American right to self-determination, it ought to be resisted in every way possible short of murder.  </p>

		<p>#12 Whiteplight, I agree the message of the MSM to whites, is, get used to taking second place. If that&rsquo;s not what the MSM would say IS the message than what is it? Demography is Destiny. Yet, you couldn&rsquo;t twist the Main Stream Medias arms hard enough to get them to admit that they obviously know this.</p>

		<p>Someday we&rsquo;ll get smart on debating policy around this issue, and re-frame it to focus on Mexico, not the USA.</p>
<p>1) We should insist on reciprocity for Americans in Mexico similar to services provided to Mexicans in America.  This has to do with medical services, birthright citizenship, social services, public education, right to own land, and the right to English-language signage.</p>
<p>2) We should demand that America&rsquo;s immigration system be reformed to the standards set by Mexican law and practice along Mexico&rsquo;s southern border.  This would result in a step up in the direction of controlling border crossing, and a step down into outright brutality.  Might be a good idea, might be a good policy. </p>

		<p>Look at it this way, defeatists.</p>
<p>Imagine if 500,000 Whites in this country just said, screw it, we&rsquo;re going to stop being racist, and we&rsquo;re going to just stick to ourselves and refuse to outbreed. Each coupling has four kids. Within one generation, the population doubles. As this continues, the population grows exponentially. </p>
<p>While the rest of the world gets mullato-ized and miscegenated, they&rsquo;ll lag behind and starve and kill themselves without the White man. White people will live in relatively prosperity amongst themselves. </p>

		<p>This is the moral dilemma of the Camp of Saints.</p>
<p>They will come, pulling on the humanitarian heartstrings. If we fail to harden our feelings and refuse them, we will bear the fatal consequences.</p>
<p>What is different from Camp of Saints is, rather than one big aggregated invasion crisis, we face a gradual death of a thousand little invasions.</p>

You are so right. I grew up in South Philadelphia in the fifties and sixties. There was no shortage of poor people or White immigrants and their American born offspring.They never came close to being the drain that blacks and mexicans are. Our White neighborhoods were clean and the people took pride in working so that the next generation would have a better life. Unlike blacks and mexicans the poor Whites and White immigrants were model citizens in the Philadelphia I grew up in.</p>

  __  __  __  __  </p>
<p>&#8220;Relatively new immigrant faces&#8221;&hellip;. ah, yes.  And in Fremont, Nebraska, no less!</p>
<p>This, basically, is what has become a very typical story all over the United States today.  Until a  generation or so ago, the big metropolitan areas were the centers of immigration. That&rsquo;s where you saw the exotic faces and heard the strange foreign tongues.  And, with rare exception, that&rsquo;s where you read about the horrible crimes.  Outside of them, out in the vast hinterland of America, across the continent,  there was little awareness of it;  everything seemed peaceful and normal. Life in White America went on as usual.  Aliens were a big city problem.  Let New York, Chicago, Los Angeles worry about it!   </p>
<p>But now, the  post-1965 alien invasion has penetrated into every niche and cranny across the land.  There is hardly any little town or rural area that is exempt from it. And if there are a few untouched places remaining, they will be getting their shipment of Sudanese or Hmong real soon.  No white enclaves can be allowed to remain.  One by one they will fall. </p>
<p>Just let someone try to tell me that this assault on America has not been planned!</p>
