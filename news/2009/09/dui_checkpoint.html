			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Penna, San Mateo Daily Journal, Sept. 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What started as a routine DUI checkpoint by the Redwood City Police Department July 2 ended with a small crowd in the North Fair Oaks neighborhood yelling, &#8220;Gringo, go home,&#8221; and &#8220;We won, you lost,&#8221; according to police on scene after a series of communication between a nonprofit director, a councilwoman and the chief of police.</p>
<p>The checkpoint was shut down early after Redwood City Councilwoman Barbara Pierce called the Police Chief Louis Cobarruviaz and expressed concern about the checkpoint&rsquo;s proximity to the Fair Oaks Community Center, popular with Latino residents. Some, including rank-and-file officers, are now questioning whether the order to shut down the checkpoint should have been made and wondering whether Pierce went too far in bringing her concerns to the chief. It also underscores a divide on the part of the Fair Oaks Community Center between providing services to their clients and letting law enforcement officials do their jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to veteran Redwood City police officers who wished to remain anonymous, officers working near the Fair Oaks Community Center July 2 were told by Capt. Chris Cesena the checkpoint was being shut down after a call to him from the police chief.</p>
<p>E-mail correspondence suggests concerns about the checkpoint were initiated by Sheryl Muñoz-Bergman, director of San Mateo County programs for the International Institute of the Bay Area. Muñoz-Bergman has an office at the community center and has been an outspoken voice for the immigrant community.</p>
<p>Muñoz-Bergman tried to contact Foust (who was out of town) and Cobarruviaz at 6:08 p.m. July 2, writing, &#8220;The Redwood City police are outside the Fair Oaks Community Center right now, using the parking lot to impound cars and arrest individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>She continued to write she was, &#8220;VERY CONCERNED about the location the police have chosen&#8221; and &#8220;would respectfully request that today if possible, and certainly in the future, that police checkpoints be located elsewhere.&#8221; She included in the subject line of the e-mail that &#8220;police were arresting clients at Fair Oaks Community Center.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also called Pierce who &hellip;  then e-mailed Foust, Cobarruviaz and City Manager Peter Ingram (who was also out of town) and wrote that after hearing from a &#8220;community member,&#8221; she was concerned that &#8220;local folks view the center as a safe place and so having the checkpoint and tow trucks there is raising concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an e-mail to Foust and Ingram, [Police Chief] Cobarruviaz said the use of Fair Oaks was &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; and that &#8220;as soon as I was notified by &hellip; Pierce of the concerns expressed by community center representatives, I notified &hellip; Cesena and asked him to move the checkpoint to a different location on Middlefield Road, [or] suspend it.&#8221; He also wrote he supported the decision and takes full responsibility.</p>
<p>During the approximately one hour and a half before the checkpoint was shut down, police issued 21 citations (19 for unlicensed drivers and two for driving with a suspended license). Nineteen cars were towed. DUI checkpoints allow police officers to demand driver&rsquo;s licenses and proof of insurance, and city leaders agree the roadblocks are an effective way to get drunken drivers off the streets.</p>
<p>After the checkpoint was shut down, police started to break down the operation, and a small crowd of about 18 people started cheering and yelling at the officers, according to officers at the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are bums, get out of our neighborhood,&#8221; and &#8220;We won, you lost,&#8221; were just a few of the catcalls, according to officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is irresponsible of the crowd. They did not show good judgment,&#8221; said Pierce. But &#8220;they [the police] could have avoided that by having [checkpoints] somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If police officers are unhappy, then maybe they need to speak with their boss,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Police, who said they were just doing their job, see it differently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was ashamed and humiliated because I am a part of this community and do not need to be told to go home,&#8221; said one officer. &#8220;It is the saddest day I have ever had in my law enforcement career.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Without getting into the specifics of Chicano behavior in this instance, police checkpoints, allowing cops to stop motorists without probable cause, are an outrageous violation of basic constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Yet how quickly we seem to acquiesce to such violations that are now routine.  Too bad the locals didn&rsquo;t pelt these Delta-Force wannabes with rocks and bottles.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, California is overrun with child-like third-world peoples. The hallmarks of such races of people are low intelligence, low levels of emotional maturity, and a lack of concern for the Public Good. That is why Mexico and Zimbabwe are chaotic and poverty stricken. As the population shifts from Western Europeans to third world rabble, the concept of public safety takes a back seat to things like &#8220;getting my drink on&#8221; and &#8220;not gittin hassled by the 5-0, homes!&#8221; </p>
<p>These people are simply too dumb to save themselves from themselves. If they were smarter, they would still be living in Mexico, which would be a prosperous, orderly society that wasn&rsquo;t run by drug cartels. Mexicans would rather see some of their children killed by drunk, unlicensed drivers than to give up the right to act irresponsibly. Ah, the genius of the &#8220;Sun People&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Regardless of the perception of some, California is still a state of the United States of America and the white population there is not a &#8220;small minority&#8221; - just not the majority.  With the publication of Hispanics yelling things like, &#8220;gringo, go home!,&#8221; and &#8220;We won!,&#8221; the discomfort will remain and one day explode.  And Mexico won&rsquo;t be sending troops in to back up their expatriots, either, they have enough on their hands inside Mexico.</p>
<p>Do not fear, the time will come for these arrogant people.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m with John /#7 on this one. I agree with the other posters about the behaviour, loyaty, expectations and tactics of the La Raza nests in SoCal and elsewhere. But these police state end runs around the Constitution that they call &#8220;Checkpoints&#8221; are one of the nostrils of the camel&rsquo;s nose. I for one, resent being pulled over by some uniformed thug to stick his nose into my vehicle to look for some excuse to arrest me and wring more revenue out of me, even though he or she has no reason to believe I&rsquo;m breaking any laws. Bear in mind that these are occurring all over the country, and the demographic face of many law enforcement agencies is evolving to a darker shade, to put it politely. If you&rsquo;ve never been the object of such attention, you may find it very unpleasant, no matter how innocent you are.</p>

		<p>&#8220;john&#8221; (#7), like it or not, is right. These checkpoints/roadblocks are nothing more than an excuse for cops to harass and intimidate motorists. (And note how at this supposed &#8220;DUI checkpoint&#8221; <i>not one</i> of the 21 citations issued was for DUI.) Any real American should be horrified at the thought of any govt. official being able to stop them at random and brusquely demand, &#8220;Your papers, please.&#8221; </p>
<p>The local cops pulled the same stunt the Friday night before Labor Day along my work commute. Fortunately they foolishly chose an area with a lot of side streets, so I (and several other drivers) simply detoured around them.</p>

		<p>Sorry to double-dip, but john is right: &#8220;checkpoints&#8221; are a violation of our Constitutional rights.  However, I don&rsquo;t worry about that much when illegals are the ones getting popped.  I should, though, because the police do it to us too, and they can easily take some technique only used on disliked people, such as illegals, and use it on the rest of us.</p>

<p>I, for another, would resent being slammed head on by a three-sheets-to-the-wind illegal alien (or anyone else), and either dying or being permanently mutilated or injured for life.  There is no such thing as right to operate a motorized vehicle on public roads (this should not be confused with the right to travel).  I don&rsquo;t have any problems with checkpoints, though I would restrict the mission of checkpoints to apprehending drunk and intoxicated drivers.</p>

		<p>Like John and others, I am absolutely enraged by the wholesale evisceration of the Fourth Amendment in the name of fighting drunk driving. When we finally get rid of the illegals, we need to send the MADD totalitarians right down to Mexico with them.</p>
<p><i>There is no such thing as right to operate a motorized vehicle on public roads</i></p>
<p>Perhaps not, but there is a right to be secure in one&rsquo;s person, house, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. And a person would have to be either very stupid or very disingenuous to argue that traffic stops which are based upon no individualized suspicion are in any way reasonable. Furthermore, as you can see, these anarcho-tyrannical checkpoints apply only to law-abiding whites, anyway. The totalitarian punks who are responsible for them run away with their tails between their legs as soon as they&rsquo;re presented with any resistance by unruly non-whites. </p>
<p><i>I, for another, would resent being slammed head on by a three-sheets-to-the-wind illegal alien</i></p>
<p>You are presenting a false dilemma. It is not necessary to shred the Fourth Amendment in order to effectively combat drunk driving and illegal immigration. And if it were, I&rsquo;d say to hell with fighting drunk driving and illegal immigration; let this country go down the drain. There are prices that are too high to pay to save America, and shredding the Bill of Rights is one of them. </p>

		<p>The shredding of the Bill of Rights is the logical and necessary outcome of our immigration policy.  It isn&rsquo;t possible to maintain the order necessary to keep ourselves fed and the lights turned on if the non-Whites are allowed the freedom that Whites take for granted, so it will be necessary to choose between a police state or Third World anarchy, famine, and warlordism.  South Africa shows us exactly what happens when Whites turn a modern nation over to primitives.  </p>
<p>As things now stand, &#8220;civil rights&#8221; are almost entirely a tool of the Reds, who attack us daily with weapons we forged out of our own decency.  Just yesterday I saw a news article about some 17 year old foreigner suing a department store for expecting her to leave her head rag off at work.  It&rsquo;s OK to discriminate against White men, but not against invading teen-agers with alien customs.  If ever we are to regain our traditional liberties, it will be after a period of struggle and demographic rearrangement.  Until that time, it&rsquo;s important that we remember those rights, why we had them, how we lost them, and exactly who they apply to.  </p>

<p>The Supreme Court has already stated that drivers in automobiles are not samey-same with people in private residences.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re speaking like someone who has never been in a bad accident where very bad driving behavior of one of the parties was involved.  It&rsquo;s easy to pontificate about rights when you&rsquo;ve never been at the receiving end of such an accident, where the vehicle you were in was rammed from the rear by four black thugs driving a stolen car, driving said car at 75 mph on a city boulevard with a 35 limit.  Luckily, their car was small and the vehicle I was in was large and very weighty, so the worst injury I got was a strained neck and a strained wrist.  Someone else in the vehicle had to be hospitalized for a month for her injuries.  The four thugs in the car, three of them died instantly, the fourth one died two days later in the ER.  </p>
<p>People have rights, granted.  But people also have a right not to be killed or maimed by drunk drivers.  When you&rsquo;re driving a motorized vehicle on public roads, you&rsquo;re guiding several tons of metal, fiber and other things at very high speeds.  </p>
<p>Who knows, if I were in a smaller automobile, I might not be here today to vent on this computer right now.  DUI checkpoints?  As many as possible, I say.  GPS technology to speed-govern your car down to the speed limit and no higher?  Fine by me, wish they would have had that a few years ago.  Classifying a death you caused by driving drunk as capital murder?  Definitely.  Allowing cops to disable an engine of a reported stolen car?  Count me in.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, standards for driver licensing can go way up, and the conditions where one could lose one&rsquo;s licenses could become many more.</p>
<p>I should add that most people who complain about DUI checkpoints tend to be habitual drunk drivers themselves.  Don&rsquo;t take that personally, SJ.  Just saying&hellip;people aren&rsquo;t that cereberal.  Most people do or think most things they do for motivations that are depressingly simple.</p>

I&rsquo;m not joking, I&rsquo;ve been wondering why I see all the cleavage at my bank.  I don&rsquo;t spend any time in business offices or department stores, so I figured that people still dressed  for work in those places, and I just assumed my local bank had a really loose manager.

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably never seen an A&F; catalog.  </p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject, in the summer of last year, I was at a St. Louis area shopping mall one Sunday.  As I was passing by the A&F; front at that particular mall, there was a young black man, mid-20s, who looked to be (and indeed turned out to be) a store employee, chatting with a young black woman, same age, I&rsquo;m guessing girlfriend, sister, cousin, or something of the like.  As I walked by, I heard him say, (exact quote), &ldquo;You think I like working at a store where I gotta look at these big a** pictures of these naked a** white boys all the time?&rdquo;  Once I heard that, I had to stop, because I couldn&rsquo;t believe I heard what I thought I just heard.  A few seconds later, he added:  &ldquo;This store makes a lotta money off of white boys showin&rsquo; off they a***s, and yet The Man tells me to pull up my pants.  S***, that&rsquo;s racism.&rdquo; (sic).  Presumably, he meant that he nor any other employee of A&F; is allowed to sag their pants at work.</p>
<p>If it were a white employee talking with another white person insulting blacks within earshot of black mall pedestrians, they would have complained right away, and have him fired ASAP.  I did indeed complain, by putting in a call to that store&rsquo;s manager the next day. </p>
<p>Though I should add that the A&F; model photos inside their locations don&rsquo;t show anything close to full frontal or rear nudity.  One might infer from some of them that the models were completely naked at the time of the photo shoot, and that they are implying suggestive nudity.  However, the posters are far less racy than A&F;&rsquo;s former catalog was, the catalog was nothing more than soft-core porn.  However, even with the in-store posters, A&F; pushed the envelope this past February by showing enough male posterior cleavage to earn the ire of Virginia Beach, Va.&rsquo;s Finest.</p>
<p>I went to that particular mall four times before moving to Carbondale in January, and I made it my business to stroll into the A&F.;  I did not see this employee there anymore.  Either my phone call worked, or I just happened to be there on the wrong days.  But squeaky wheels do get the grease.</p>

		<p>     In NJ the cops do not even pull over illegals. If they look hispanic,they are sent on their way. It&rsquo;s the whites that are the targets now . You see we have insurance and will pay our fines. In my town ( largely Italian) the cops do not issue summonses to Italians or Hispanics. It&rsquo;s up to the rest of us to carry the freight. We are rapidly devolving into a tribal society. I guarentee the US will not be here, in it&rsquo;s present condition, in twenty years.</p>

<p>&#8220;The arrogant red-diaper grandkids who run Hollywood actually believe they have non-whites in their hip pockets. But they don&rsquo;t. When things collapse in a heap these arrogant, ostentatious will be running to the rest of the white population they so despise and look down on as the blacks and browns go to town on them. Help from their hated &ldquo;white trash&rdquo; targets won&rsquo;t be forthcoming. &#8220;</p>
<p>&gt; Gee, where did you learn that &#8220;Red Diaper Baby&#8221; slogan.  Associating with the intellectual elite, are you? </p>
<p>I tend to not think that they will be running towards the White Conservatives for protection, as a group or otherwise.  For one thing, many sound as if they would simply murder them in cold blood if the laws were suspended.  That&rsquo;s also why even conservative Jews are forced to look askance at the White Christian Conservative movement - it relies on old cliches that conjur up scenes of people being hunted down and burned as witches or exterminated en mass.  I count myself a race realist, but even I have reservations about a future ruled by some of those who claim to be out to save America.  This tendancy to wish to cull out our own race through murderous purges, is all too real historically.  After all, European history is not the record of 2,000 years of peaceful co-existance among whites.</p>
<p>The White Realist movement needs a new, improved philosophy in order to have any chance of succeeding.</p>
<p>What we have in the Hollywood Liberal types are people who actually identify, in a predictable way, with the mass of people and culture around them.  And this is what our government since 1965 has been counting on.  </p>
<p>The strange biological/psychological fact is that you can raise a chicken with a dog and the chicken will think it is a dog.  This can be done with virtually any species, it is called &#8220;imprinting.&#8221;  That is why someone like Klohe Khassasian would date and marry a physically clashing black basketball player.  Hollywood types, like the anorexic actress, don&rsquo;t see white skin or culture when they look in the mirror.  Pop culture and fashion strives, like unisex clothing styles blur sexual ID, to blur racial ID.  The government at every level reinforces the trend with laws that support it.  Divide and conquer.  </p>
<p>I witnessed a party near my home this weekend, A large group of Hispanics were filing into a house after parking their cars around in the usual, messy fashion.  Among them was one glaringly white, blonde, young female.  She has been brain-washed to the point that she does not see herself when she looks in the mirror.  This is supposed to be color blindness, but it is in actuality a type of brainwashing that has to be creating unhealthy psychological, mind shutdowns in order for it to prevail.  That is how the nervous system works when under an unnatural sensory overload.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Chinese and even the Vietnamese had the right idea about re-education camps once they gained power?</p>
<p>We ought to always be looking forward rather than simply reacting and wishing to return to the past, which is impossible anyway, lest we destroy ourselves from within.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Gringo go home&#8221;. Hmm, that sounds familiar. In fact, it was one of the fanatical cries of the reconquista&rsquo;s and illegal aliens at their Gran Marches a couple of years ago. It was also on a lot of posters in the form of, Gringos Go back to Europe. </p>

		<p>Last Wednesday, a bicycle rider was killed, hit an run style, by a Hispanic man.  They found the car and located the perp.  I do not know, but I think the News inference was that the man was DUI.</p>
<p>We had nearly eliminated both hit and runs and DUIs in the U.S.  Now, with the influx of so many Hispanics in the past ten years, this is a daily occurence all over the nation.  It happens regularly in the Portland, OR region.</p>
<p>Question Diversity is right, until you have been rear-ended by a drunk driver, and they are nearly always speeding as in my case, you might think that DUI checkpoints are some sort of over-reach by the law.  Myself, I am glad they are there and wish there were more of them.  If you want to go out and drink that badly, hire a taxi.  Driving is a privilege, not a right.</p>

		<p><i>The Supreme Court has already stated that drivers in automobiles are not samey-same with people in private residences.</i></p>
<p>You mean that same group of black-robed clowns who gave us decisions like <i>Plyler v. Doe</i> and <i>Brown v, Board</i>? You&rsquo;ll excuse me if I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical. </p>
<p>While you might be able to convince me that a lower level of suspicion is required to pull a motorist over than to enter a person&rsquo;s home, no honest interpretation of the Fourth Amendment can possibly allow for totally suspicionless traffic stops. There must be some level of individualized suspicion. Any court ruling that allows people to be stopped based upon no individualized suspicion whatsoever makes a mockery of the Fourth Amendment. Period, paragraph, end of story.</p>

<p>In California, the elites are no longer white. It&rsquo;s a mess of miscegenation, with whites heavily intermarried with Chinese, Mexicans, Vietnamese, and Iranians. Some of it has to do with rich high tech geeks finally deciding to settle down with teenage immigrant women, who apparently aren&rsquo;t physically repulsed by old men so long as there is money in the bank and a large house in which to host the extended third world family.  These people are basically stateless, with no loyalty to their race, community, or country because they don&rsquo;t have one   &mdash;   or it&rsquo;s Mexico, China, or Vietnam: wherever they bought a retirement home cheap. </p>
