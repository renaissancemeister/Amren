<h1>New Gang Czar: History Key to Improving Black-Brown Relations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Stoltze, KPCC (Pasadena Public Radio), September 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa Tuesday named a new director of youth development and gang reduction. KPCC&rsquo;s Frank Stoltze reports.</p>
<p>Frank Stoltze: The mayor introduced Guillermo Cespedes in the ornate Tom Bradley Room that sits atop City Hall on the 27th floor. The room provides a view of the some of the tough neighborhoods to the south and east where Cespedes will do his work leading the city&rsquo;s gang prevention and intervention programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cespedes: The work that intervention workers do in the community differs radically from African-American neighborhoods and Latino neighborhoods. Ya know, sometimes, I think we get a little bit cautious about looking at ethnic differences.</p>
<p>Stoltze: Cespedes says it&rsquo;s important to respect those differences, and to recognize the history Latinos and African-Americans share. He&rsquo;s taught on the subject at Cal State Dominguez Hills.</p>
<p>Cespedes: The collaboration between Latinos and Africa&rsquo;s children throughout Latin America has been historic. Africa&rsquo;s children fought in every war of independence in every Latin American country. There were injunctions against collaboration between indigenous and Africa&rsquo;s children, there were many of Africa&rsquo;s children that cross the border into Mexico.</p>
<p>Stoltze: Cespedes says schools should teach that history as a method of reducing gang and youth violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stoltze: Cespedes is a native of Cuba. He grew up in New York City and holds a master&rsquo;s degree in social work from Columbia University. {snip}</p>

		<p>How is this going to reduce gang violence?  The more fundamental question is this:  Is gang violence really that big a problem?  I am of the opinion that it isn&rsquo;t as big a percentage of overall black and Hispanic violence as the gang mitigation-industrial complex would have us believe.  The other inconvenient truth about black and Hispanic gang violence is that it is contained within black and Hispanic communities   &mdash;   people (including other blacks and Hispanics) who don&rsquo;t run with a gang don&rsquo;t get bothered by the gang in a violent way.  Now they ARE at risk of other sorts of black and Hispanic violence.</p>
<p>Legislation that deals with gangs is usually on very shaky Constitutional ground, because the concept of a &#8220;gang&#8221; is fluid among blacks and Hispanics (more so blacks).  The Crips, Bloods, GDs, MS-13, Mara 18 and Latin Kings do not have national headquarters and do not print membership cards.  The reality is that &#8220;Gangs&#8221; in this case is like pornography:  You know what is porn, and what isn&rsquo;t porn; however, there is a huge gray area.  Likewise, there are the real hard core gang bangers, there are genuine non-bangers, but there is also a huge gray area of kinda so kinda not bangers.  </p>

		<p>This gang czar will be no more effective than Nancy Reagan&rsquo;s &#8220;just say no to drugs&#8221; campaign.</p>
<p>The problems isn&rsquo;t one that can be remedied with history lessons or an appeal to logic to people who have very little ability to think in reasonable, logical terms.</p>
<p>The here and the now are upermost in both blacks and browns, and because of the vast difference in everything about both groups and because both are on a tribal unity level nothing will work but separation.</p>
<p>But will this most effective, easiest remedy be put into play? Of course not.</p>
<p>The racial situation will continue until critical mass is reached, and Southern California will turn out to to be the area of ground zero in the coming civil upheaval.</p>
<p>As goes California, so goes the rest of the country.  </p>
<p>The continuing unemployment figures and reduction in social benefits will be the indicators to keep track of.  As they worsen, so shall racial conflict.</p>
<p>Such is life in a multicultural paradise where the tribes are composed of illiterate, uneducated thugs who have to be cared for like children.</p>
<p>We are witnessing the last days of the American Empire, and, like all empires before it, it too will collapse in violence.</p>
<p>How will you protect yourselves?  Will you have anything to eat or drink if the stores run out of food and the water supply and power grids are shut down?  </p>
<p>Are you ready? Or will you be just a part of the wondering displaced persons who will be scrounging for food at the mercy of every white-hating thug roaming the streets?</p>

As Mr. Taylor has pointed out before, something that&rsquo;s supposed to be natural and normal requires extraordinary efforts to even make it appear to work.</p>
<p>You can argue that black is white and up is down but it just isn&rsquo;t so.</p>
<p>Diversity is not normal or natural. People will always see the difference between each other.</p>
<p>Good luck with this one.<br>

For decades Blacks and Latinos have been relentlessly propagandized with anti-White hate propaganda. That part of the brainwashing was a total success. But the part about blacks and browns loving each other and forming a united front against whitey, not so much. Somehow, despite, the ceaseless &#8220;get Whitey&#8221; harangues, they still hate each other, too.</p>
<p>So what do the L.A. NWO fanatics do to make sure Whitey gets his absolute comeuppence from every criminal of color?  They appoint an Afro-Cuban (born in NYC) Gang Czar to sic all of these violent criminals on what remains of the White population. And we get to pay for it (and everything else) with our taxes. Isn&rsquo;t that clever. Why didn&rsquo;t we think of it? </p>
<p>White men, the final hour has come round at last. Arise from your collective stupor and do something!</p>

<p>Gang violence is a bigger problem than most people believe it is. Since most of the gang members are Black or  Hispanic, the news media doesn&rsquo;t want to  carry stories about it for fear of being racist. Here in Upstate South Carolina, they arrested 125 gang members, mostly Blacks and Hispanics. The story ran one day on the local news and then nothing. </p>
<p>Grenville has had to impose a curfews downtown on teens because of Black teenagers. The local news keep showing film footage of white teens from the local Governors School walking around downtown, as if they were the reason for the curfews.<br>

		<p>This is yet another program that only will benefit government employee&rsquo;s.  A united minority front against whites has failed.  Hispanic and Asians hate blacks more than most whites.  I lived in California and can testify, I&rsquo;ve seen it many times.  Go to any &#8220;people of color&#8221; events and you&rsquo;ll see no minorities other than blacks.</p>

		<p>Great thinking&hellip; reminding Hispanics that they and Blacks are historic allies. Including reminding Blacks that illegal immigrants pushing them out of low-end jobs are really doing Blacks a &#8220;favor&#8221;&hellip; by helping them get on the welfare rolls due to an inability to get jobs.</p>
<p>You do have to laugh at the picture. About the only good thing you can say about Hispanics, collectively, being that they&rsquo;re generally a good bit smarter than the average Black.</p>

		<p>QD, although gang members often fight rivals, they also target adolescents (and pre-adolescents) in their neighborhoods who aren&rsquo;t gang members.  Some teens end up joining gangs just for protection and safety in numbers, becoming part of the criminal class.  White teens in proximity to gangs can also end up joining or acting &#8220;ghetto&#8221; for protection.  (Northern MA, southern NH and Hispanic gangs for instance.)</p>
<p>If black and Hispanic gangsters move out of the state of mind where they&rsquo;re constantly ready to go after each other, they might be more peaceable generally.  The chances of success of any of these programs are always slim, and one possibility is the program may attempt to replace mutual animosity with animosity against whites.</p>

<p>They obviously don&rsquo;t care about that.  Or rather, they&rsquo;ll cross that bridge when they come to it.  So great is their hatred/resentment of whites that they&rsquo;re consumed by it, and all other considerations are secondary in comparison. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an emotional, not rational, obsession.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m up to here with the current love affair with the word &#8220;czar&#8221;. It&rsquo;s meaning, though dismally appropriate in this administration, is about as anti-American as Cesar Chavez. Its meaning is &#8216;anti-Christian Supreme Ruler, with its original meaning being &#8216;potentate&rsquo;. Neither has a place in America. I cringe every time I hear it.</p>

		<p>Yet another pathetic attempt to unite blacks and Latinos against whitey. Though both blacks and Latinos may hate whites, white individuals are not the ones gunning them down in the streets of L.A. It is a lot easier to hate intimate, immediate enemies than your historical oppressors who live farther away. This whole idea of a rainbow coalition needs to end. I have many Latino and Asian friends who have nothing but contempt for blacks. In conclusion, if such a rainbow coalition were to be created, we whites must respond by uniting with other whites. </p>

		<p>It never seemed to me that Hispanics regarded themselves as &#8220;natural allies&#8221; of black Africans.</p>
<p>Quite the contrary, most I&rsquo;ve known seemed to despise blacks, and far more openly than whites would ever dare to.  Most seemed to wonder why whites put up with the criminality, lack of productivity, and the burdens blacks impose on the white majority.</p>

		<p>What I notice is that the black and Hispanic leadership imagines some sort of grand alliance of blacks and Hispanics against whites, but on the ground the ordinary blacks and Hispanics still fight against each other.  An even higher percentage of blacks than whites favors deporting illegal aliens, but the black leadership betrays them on that issue just as the white leadership betrays us.</p>

		<p>Why do the majority of blacks not only have this chip on their shoulder, but, as another poster pointed out, they have this childish and rebellious nature to them?  Like &#8220;We&rsquo;s gunnna get back at&rsquo; da&rsquo; white man&#8221; and they want other non-whites to follow their hateful victim mentality.

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how far back they are going to find this utopian black/brown history because I&rsquo;ve lived here for almost fifty years and my 94 year old grandfather is still living down the way in his house that he bought right after WWII. We&rsquo;ve never seen this black/brown unity nor did my great grandparents. The only time we&rsquo;ve ever seen them come together is to go after whites. The rest of the time they have, historically, been at each others throats either politically for scarce resources and power or literally in the streets.</p>
