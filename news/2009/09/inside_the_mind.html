<h1>Inside the Mind of Joe Wilson</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Benjamin, Salon, September 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When he called the president a liar, Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., apparently &#8220;forgot&#8221; he wasn&rsquo;t at one of those rowdy town halls.</p>
<p>Besides the show of disrespect, and the fact that he was wrong, the legislator&rsquo;s comments expose a virulent racism and paranoia against undocumented workers. As we enter Hispanic Heritage Month, America would do well to examine the legislator&rsquo;s political paranoia instead of rehashing his churlish, attention-seeking outburst. The legislator&rsquo;s behavior is uncommon, but his attitude is not.</p>
<p>As members of Congress discussed healthcare reform with their constituents over the recent recess, many faced repeated, heated charges that the reform would stick &#8220;American taxpayers&#8221;  &mdash;  as if undocumented workers don&rsquo;t pay consumption taxes!  &mdash;  with the healthcare bills of illegal immigrants. If the swine flu weren&rsquo;t enough to stigmatize Latino immigrants, now there&rsquo;s the healthcare debate.</p>
<p>How did racism and xenophobia become so deeply enmeshed in this debate?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Race  &mdash;  that is, 30 years of government-supported desegregation and the sharp increase of brown immigration  &mdash;  is not incidental to the public&rsquo;s cynicism, disconnection and unwillingness to support the public sector, meaning the goods, services and places that belong to &#8220;we the people.&#8221; That&rsquo;s especially true when we talk about healthcare.</p>
<p>Eduardo Porter, a financial journalist and editorial board member of the New York Times, has documented how &#8220;racial and ethnic diversity undermine support for public investment in social welfare. For all the appeal of America&rsquo;s melting pot, the country&rsquo;s diverse ethnic mix is one main reason for entrenched opposition to public spending on the public good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moreover, two Harvard economists have correlated diversity with public spending in Western Europe and the United States. The economists demonstrated that half the social-spending gap between the two areas was due to the United States&rsquo; more varied racial and ethnic mix. (The other half was due largely to the stronger left-wing parties in Western Europe.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Put bluntly, it is not a coincidence that America&rsquo;s love affair with all-things private  &mdash;  gated communities, private roads, private parks, private schools, private playgrounds, private hospitals  &mdash;  heated up during the 1950s as the federal government sought to integrate the nation.</p>
<p>As the U.S. government began helping everyday Americans at unprecedented levels from FDR&rsquo;s New Deal on, immigration has become all the more contentious. Immigration broils as an issue precisely as this nation faces budget deficits and potential cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, the state university systems and so on. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} As the president and America debate a large, necessary overhaul of the public sector, expect more xenophobic outbursts like Wilson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tea baggers rail against social programs that are allegedly squandered on &#8220;illegal aliens.&#8221; The Birther movement rails against a supposedly Muslim president. Healthcare reform town halls combust over &#8220;government dependence.&#8221; Republicans like Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., push a boycott of the 2010 Census, fretting that immigrants and minorities will be overcounted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We must understand Wilson&rsquo;s outburst by exposing its past and future context  &mdash;  including what I call &#8220;The White People Deadline,&#8221; 2042. And then we must move the healthcare debate forward.<br>

		<p>The author of this blatant article implies that white people who are concerned about the changing demographics of our nation are somehow irrational haters. But obviously the author is unaware of the damage and societal decline due to diversity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at Los Angeles, by far one of the most diverse cities in our nation. A search on google for the high school drop-out rate in Los Angeles would reveal that 1/3rd quit school. This has detrimental implications for the future, because there will be such a large pool of unskilled workers making only minimum wage and probably on welfare.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t want to see all of America&rsquo;s cities become like Los Angeles, which is what will happen when blacks and Hispanics become the majority. That does not make me a hater.</p>

		<p>Newsflash, Richard Benjamin who writes for George Soros magazine:  Joe Wilson isn&rsquo;t a Vermont politician.  I hope Benjamin sends a copy of this article to every white adult in Wilson&rsquo;s district, that way he&rsquo;ll get 99% of the white vote every time he runs.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of a line from &#8220;Hoosiers&#8221;. It`s where Gene Hackman irritates an old  coach wanna be with his training techniques. The man says, &#8220;Mister there`s two kinds of crazy. Ones a guy who gets drunk, runs naked  out into snow  and howls at the moon. The second`s  a guy who does the same thing in my living room.&#8221; And that pretty much describes the immigration debate&hellip; if you ask me.</p>

		<p>It is not the government&rsquo;s job to integrate the nation.  Nor do any groups have an entitlement to immigrate here.  The government&rsquo;s responsiblity is to ensure that all groups are treated equally under the law.  And that responsibility has been carried out.  Imposing low cost housing and school busing on the nation is far beyond what the government&rsquo;s involvement on the public should be.  Determining what groups and how many immigrate to this country is within the government&rsquo;s realm of responsibility.  You take in those who would most benefit the nation.  I am sick and tired of the reasoning that everything which is not specifically done to enhance the positions of minorities in this counrty is racist.  </p>

		<p>I pity the poor, crazy Salon writers.</p>
<p>&#8220;a virulent racism and paranoia against undocumented workers&#8221;</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants are not always workers (example:  children), and most probably ARE documented - just not with documents that allow residency in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paranoia&#8221; is an irrational fear.  There is nothing irrational about the fear of being overrun by another people.<br>

<p>And &#8220;put bluntly&#8221;, it is not a coincidence that whites supporting the above are among the most adamant, fervent advocates and defenders of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; (Does Mr. Benjamin know why the children of the late Ted Kennedy and his pro-integration political allies swiftly removed their children from the soon-to-be-&#8216;enriched&rsquo; public schools into 97% white private schools when integration was achieved?).</p>

<p>You conflated it Mr. Benjamin. The behavior is common enough and Wilson&rsquo;s attitude is becoming increasingly common as the Obama administration continues. Where was the outrage as Bush was booed at his 2005 State of The Union address?</p>

		<p>You may ask, as I did, &#8220;Who is this dim bulb Richard Benjamin, and who the &#8220;*%^ is he to call me racist and a liar?&#8221;  Do a little research, and you find he is an affirmative action Angry Black Male.  He goes by the hip name of Rich instead of Richard, and he has a book coming out soon called &#8220;Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey Into the Heart of White America&#8221;.  I really think that&rsquo;s all you need to know.  I am sure you&rsquo;ll see him pimped by the MSM and the New York Times.  Maybe even on Oprah.  Who knows how far the Angry Black Male routine can take him?  Heck man, maybe to the presidency?</p>

		<p>Its not just &#8220;racism&#8221;, its just even with the best of intentions, a social welfare state simply does not work with a large thirdworld population. For example the New York Time&rsquo;s had an article which was their single most popular article online this week, which claimed the entire reason why US medical care is roughly twice is expensive as in Europe and other industrialized areas, is nearly entirely explained by the US&rsquo;s horrific obesity rate rather than supposedly ineffective capitalist system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/opinion/10pollan.html?_r=1&amp;em" rel="nofollow">https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/opinion/10pollan.html?_r=1&em;</a></p>
<p>While whites are by no means blameless, as pointed out in a recent article posted on this site, blacks have roughly double the obesity rates as white and the healthcare crises would not nearly be as big as a financial catastrophe it currently is, without the bulbous round black and hispanics eating little else besides fast food 365 days a year. </p>
<p>The massive costs of healthcare then causes disastrous reverberations throughout society, not only make healthcare enormously expensive, but also causes massive unemployment and wage stagnation due to the high costs shouldered by employers who do provide healthcare benefits, not least of all state and local governments which are forced into financial collapse as a result of their public sector unions sucking the coffers dry as in California.</p>
<p>I was a socialist as a youth and would very much like to still support a social welfare state, yet this is simply not possible in a society where those people with sense of dignity and honor and who are willing to shoulder their share of the load are a minority, and the shirkers are a majority.</p>

		<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re green-blooded, pointy-eared Vulcans. Their race has the least to do with anything. What DOES matter is a), they&rsquo;re ILLEGALLY HERE. That makes them criminals. b)  their culture, which means their behavior, their language (which is not our language), c) their attitude, and d), our government is bending over backwards to cater to them while they stab the tax paying citizens who subsidize them in the back. The white American guilt trip ploy doesn&rsquo;t phase me in the least anymore.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to call Congressman Wilson&rsquo;s office since his outburst during the President&rsquo;s speech with no luck.  His web site is down and all the phones have been busy.  I finally got the voice mail and left a message applauding him for calling a spade a spade in some rather un-pc terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must understand Wilson&rsquo;s outburst by exposing its past and future context &mdash; including what I call &ldquo;The White People Deadline,&rdquo; 2042. And then we must move the healthcare debate forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>We need to get over this false notion that Whites will become a minority in 2042 because it will happen alot sooner.  The Census Bureau does not have a category for European-Americans, only &#8220;Non-Hispanic White&#8221; which includes Arabs and other Middle Easterners.  That puts our numbers at around 60 percent of the population.  At best we&rsquo;re talking about a little more than 20 years from now.    </p>

		<p>Racism? Xenophobia? Perhaps we misunderstood you, Mr. Benjamin. Americans call it patriotism and love of country! Before you begin the leftist nonsense you&rsquo;re spouting, how about checking figures on the price American taxpayers are burdened with from illegal aliens. No matter how much &#8220;comsumption&#8221; tax illegal aliens pay, it will never come near what they consume. Do you really want to fill this country with uneducated people whose mindset is one of generational dependence on welfare, the increased crime rate, the skyrockting teen birth rate and the bilingual morass we&rsquo;ve found ourselves in? If so, I suggest you&rsquo;ll find it in Mexico. The rest of us want to stay right here in our own country without the invasion from the south.</p>

		<p>Rep. Joe Wilson and other Republicans tried to pass an amendment to the health care bill that would require that recipients&rsquo; legal residency be established.  It was rejected by the Democrats.  Clearly, taxpayer funded health care will go to illegal immigrants (it already does) so Obama was indeed lying.</p>
<p><i>Eduardo Porter, a financial journalist and editorial board member of the New York Times, has documented how &#8220;racial and ethnic diversity undermine support for public investment in social welfare.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>There is some truth to this.  We whites are tired of paying for our dispossession.  We are fed up with paying for the illegitimate children of blacks and Hispanics.  We&rsquo;ve had enough of Hispanics who don&rsquo;t pay enough taxes to educate one child but who put eight kids in our public schools.</p>
<p>I am no fan of socialism generally, but the only cases where it has even a chance of working are in ethnically homogeneous nations, where the citizens regard themselves as one people, and are willing to make sacrifices for others they see as much like themselves.  The United States has always been too racially diversified for socialism to work here.  As it becomes more diverse the probability of socialism being voted in increases while the probability of socialism succeeding decreases.  For blacks and Hispanics socialism is a way to take money from white people and give it to themselves.  It is the white people who are called wicked if they express opposition to this.<br>

		<p>I have two comments:</p>
<p>1. Forget about the illegals themselves. Almost all the anchor babies receive Medicaid. I do phone surveys now for a living and I speak Spanish, so I know. </p>
<p>2. Some years ago when I worked in the pharmaceutical industry as a clinical trials monitor I had a site in Houston. When I asked the study coordinator about recruitment for our study through the ER (it was a gastroenterology study) he said it was very difficult because most of them were coming in for gunshot wounds, stabbing, etc. I noticed as we walked through the ER waiting room that almost everyone was speaking Spanish. </p>
<p>To top it off,when I went upstairs to review the records of the few patients they had,I had a big hassle making copies of documents I needed to retrieve and send back to the sponsor. I had to really beg because they were so low on resources you had to get special permission to use the copier and the paper.</p>
<p>As I drove out of Houston over to Biloxi, MS, almost all the radio stations were in Spanish, not English. </p>
<p>That trip was a real eye-opener. </p>

While it&rsquo;s sad that Mr. Wilson sullied the reputation of whites by acting in a boorish manner (and giving our enemies ammunition against us), we all know that when they tell us illegals won&rsquo;t have access to health care, we know they&rsquo;re lying.</p>
<p>I said it yesterday. Not only will they be covered, they will get free care by virtue of being poor, &#8216;at risk&rsquo;, and my favorite justification for doling out money, &#8216;under served&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;The White People&rsquo;s Deadline,&rdquo; 2042. Oh my, that&rsquo;s a great term. I wish whites were allowed to openly use phrases like that. It could be a great rallying cry. As it is, only leftists like this Richard Benjamin may use such terms, to snidely bandy them about and use them as a club while whites cover their heads and shrink away in fear and shame. All the while the leftists like this laugh and sneer at the cowardice of whites. It is indeed &ldquo;The White People&rsquo;s Deadline,&rdquo; with emphasis on the word DEAD. </p>

 <br>
What this &#8216;master of the obvious&rsquo; says is true. The more diverse a society, the less a feeling of community exists. People feel most comfortable and altruistic with those most genetically and/or culturally like themselves. </p>
<p>About 10 years ago when I was taking some classes at a local univeristy, I stumbled upon a sociololgy journal article about ethnicity and conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The authors cited a long term series of surveys from several years before the 1992-1995 civil war until the very eve of the war. The surveys accurately predicted which Yugoslav republics would explode into conflict. Very homogenous provinces, like Slovenia, had little conflict prior to the war, and quickly won their independence at the very beginning. The more diverse republics like Croatia and Bosnia erupted into long term conflicts because no group had an overwhelming majority. The authors pointed out that once a minority reaches about 25-33% of the populace, they will begin to assert themselves at the expense of the majority. The majority group will be forced to defend themselves in order to insure their survival. Croatia had a worse time then Slovenia, but in many respects due to the arms embargo, but they did finally bring their war to a close, Bosnia had the biggest mess because of the balance in size of the Muslim, Serb, and Croat populations. </p>
<p>And these were all white people. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not the disrespect angle that worries me but the fact that Congressman Wilson&rsquo;s outburst will &#8220;galvanize&#8221; (the MSM seem to love that word) the democrats against us.  Of course, we would have faced considerable opposition from them at any rate.  So, Joe told the truth, and I applaud that.  I would reelect Joe Wilson ten times over!!!!  Liberals have such a double-standard regarding outbursts and name-calling.  I well recall watching the video &#8220;Jared Taylor vs. Air America Lefty&#8221; (Young Turks)linked on this page and getting red-faced with anger when that loudmouth referred to Mr. Taylor (at the very end of the video) as an &#8220;idiot.&#8221;  Joe told the truth; let the lefties get over it.  Let them learn to take a dose of their own medicine.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;.and the sharp increase of brown immigration&#8221;(he doesn&rsquo;t mention most of it being illegal)</p>
<p>&#8220;How did racism and xenophobia become so deeply enmeshed in this debate.&#8221; (No comrade Benjamin, Americans don&rsquo;t want their taxes and resources going to people who have no business even being here against U.S. Law, in fact, Comrade Benjamin)</p>
<p>&#8220;If the swine flu weren&rsquo;t enough to stigmatize &#8220;latino immigrants&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;(Illegal aliens Comrade Benjamin, because the swine flu broke out in Mexico, would you rather have had Americans close their eyes and open the border to show they aren&rsquo;t &#8220;racist&#8221; during the swine flu outbreak?)</p>

<p>Back in the early 1970&rsquo;s the newspaper writer Jack Mabley had said the event will occur by 2035. He had some inside info we don&rsquo;t have? And that figure now bandied about of 2042 was first 2050. All those figures assume the rates of change will be more or less constant from what they are now. That is not realistic. The rate of change will accelerate markedly in the near future if all the current illegals are given amnesty!</p>

<p>The very people who are calling you a racist are very open their racail preference for America and it doesn&rsquo;t nclude Native Born Whie Americans. Why do you folks let them get away with this?</p>
<p>You should be accusing them of being racist for wanting to bring about the rapid race-replacement of the majority Native Born White America population.</p>
<p>REading some of the comments in this thread I get the impression that some of you would go along with the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans if it is done through LEGAL immigration. White Nationlaist are opposed to non-white LEGAL immigration</p>

Whites need to have more children and need to stop immigration and welfare.  Welfare enslaves working people and that means it enslaves us!  <br>
Keep up the good fight.  And let us never forget how much the black man hates us and how much injustice WE white people do against ourselves.  Another example is shown below.</p>

I disagree.  I&rsquo;m glad Wilson was rude, because it brought lots of attention to an important aspect of the &#8220;health care reform&#8221; debate.  Obviously we don&rsquo;t want to internalize the mindless, reflexive rudeness of the left (which R. Benjamin illustrates when he refers to tax protestors as &#8220;tea baggers&#8221;), but at the right time and place, rudeness can be very effective.

<p>Keep hammering away the point that they should go live among the non-Whites to prove their belief in equality.  Most will refuse to do so for whatever reason.</p>
<p>(The idea is to get them thinking about being a real minority in a real world.  A world with cruelty and hatred that will come back to haunt them too.)</p>
<p>Ask them &#8220;If you like the thought of living in a majority non-White society so much why don&rsquo;t you move to such a place right now?&#8221;  Wait for whatever excuse they give, then suggest to them that what they really believe is in revenge against other White people than themselves.  (This is why they refuse to move to a majority non-White society but praise any story of Whites becomming a minority.)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be suprised if they refuse to admit their anti-White bias.  Their actions will tell you the truth that their words will not.</p>

The racial displacement of White America through mass immigration isn&rsquo;t an accident, it&rsquo;s not evolution. It&rsquo;s ideology. It&rsquo;s deliberate. And as long as Whites continue to elect non-Whites to govern them, be it left or right, they&rsquo;ll only accelerate their own demise. </p>

		<p>The problems our country is facing are enormous. Soon, much sooner than we would like, the Industrious East will overtake us. I am not a defeatist, and I only want the best for the Americans written about by Wilmot Robertson, but economics has its own logic and it points away from us. I recall twenty years ago I talked with a classmate who was studying pharmaceutics, how it was disturbing to note that the Eastern bloc was turning out more scientific papers than ourselves, or the Europeans. That was a long time ago. The situation has gotten worse, and the decline is accelerating. The immigrants we are importing are simply not up to the job. <br>
The East has no, repeat no, sympathy for our racial &#8220;dilemma&#8221; in Gunnar Myrdal&rsquo;s phrase; they don&rsquo;t care because they themselves are profoundly ethnocentric and could give a rip if we aren&rsquo;t. They laugh at our discomfort, at our guilt, but are awfully glad we buy their products, and are happy to lend us vast quantities of money. Our concern about racial matters, hope and change and all of it, is an errand to nowhere. While our so-called leaders primp and doodle, our competitors plan and act and plan some more.<br>

<p>White people are supposed to be the more civilized people! This means (at the very least) having good manners.

This point is even more important when one considers that Congressman Wilson  &mdash;  along with a growing number of critics of Obama  &mdash;  will have every chance to make themselves heard in the near future.</p>
<p>Congressman Wilson apologized. This apology was accepted by President Obama. End of story! Let us move on&hellip;</p>

<p>Yes, it seems that way with some. However, Jupiter, you are way ahead of yourself. You are fighting shadows when you talk of serious things like &#8220;race replacement&#8221;, and other such heavy topics.</p>
<p>Allow me to humbly explain my way of looking at this stuff. First of all, most whites in America, ranging from the very old to the very young, HAVEN&rsquo;T GOT THE SLIGHTEST CLUE AS TO THEIR HISTORICAL PLACE IN THE U.S. They are literally &#8220;UNCONSCIOUS&#8221;, to repeat, &#8220;UNCONSCIOUS&#8221;, of their history, their European roots, or their common culture with other European/Americans.</p>
<p>Friend, you first have to have some degree of awareness and connectedness to the very country and people that are like you to even CARE about the heavy concepts you bring up. You have to see some value and worth in a common heritage, a common language,etc. While Black Americans became very interested about these things when Alex Haley published roots( his historical accuracy doen&rsquo;t concern this argument)many White Americans just applauded and watched the TV series, the whole point of which went right over their heads as far as their own racial group was concerned.</p>
<p>I am telling you that most whites are clueless about the most basic things concerning their heritage and history in this nation. You are expecting them to eat steak, when all they are capable of digesting is mothers milk. This is NOT to make light of your concerns, on the contrary,it is to highlight them, by using comparison and contrast. </p>
<p>Here is a test to illuminate the validity of much of what I&rsquo;ve said. Go to the average white American on the street and ask them questions like, &#8220;What religion did your ancestors practice?&#8221; &#8220;Do you know the parts of the U.S. that are the most educated?&#8221; &#8220;Where in the U.S.is polka music still popular?&#8221; Are there a lot of Polish people in Chicago? What kind of name is Budweiser, or Coors? Did slaves build America? Did white people from Europe build America? You get the idea. Now, just listen to the answers and then you will get the gist of where millions of  white Americans are, when it comes to any consciousness of their very place or history in this nation. White Americans, are still crawling and can&rsquo;t be expected to run, not in the mental state most are in. I&rsquo;m not even including those lost causes who are irreparably damaged by white hating liberals.</p>

		<p>#43 David K. Meller, I have to disagree with you about civility in Congress. What Congress has been doing to the American citzienry, involving illegal immigration,as well as Wall Street bailouts and other abominations, is NOT CIVIL. What is wrong with a little heated emotion? I have watched many of Englands politicians, throwing things and yelling names at each other, when there is disagreement on a vital issue. I wouldn&rsquo;t want it to become a habit in the U.S., but lets be honest, Wilsons outburst caused the Main Stream News Media to address the problem of illegal immigration, and health care. Had Obama been allowed to smoothly ramble on, illegal aliens receiving taxpayer funded health care would never have come to light.</p>

		<p>When Mr Benjamin refers to (I&rsquo;m going to be polite and not say &#8220;exults over&#8221;) the Deadline of 2042, and cites all the relevant demographic projections, what he fails to mention is these numbers - most certainly including the current %-of-population figures - are not arrived at organically but artificially; the result of careful, deliberate, long-range <i>social engineering</i>. (Or, more precisely, &#8220;re-engineering&#8221;.)</p>
<p>In other words, &#8220;white deadlines&#8221; aren&rsquo;t born - at least, not in nations traditionally 90% white, they&rsquo;re not - they&rsquo;re made. Nor has this been merely a matter of relaxed immigration restrictions, either. First came the (still ongoing) process of relentlessly propagandizing guilt, shame and self-loathing into the ethnic majority via Gramscian dominoes: first the media, then academia, and finally and fatally, through government itself. Until you reach the sad pass we&rsquo;ve recently arrived at, where every group may openly declare group interests but the one most vital to civilization.</p>
<p>As it now stands, whiteness can only be referred to as an individual characteristic (i.e., &#8220;I am white&#8221;), and then preferably sheepishly; as a group characteristic (&#8220;we are white&#8221;), only pejoratively.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to admit it: compared to us, the social engineering of Stalin and Mao was amateur hour. And <i>their</i> intent was merely to enslave their kinsmen, not replace them!  <br>

Survival is at stake-politeness is for time of peace. Some advanced civilizations combined the two-the result being chivalry. But we&rsquo;re not there anymore, and we&rsquo;re fighting people of another mindset-it&rsquo;s not going to be pretty. Chivalry is almost always intra-cultural not inter-cultural. <br>
      Also the age of ideology is over. Are we threatened economically by East? Yes, it will be a serious issue is we survive! Once we have that taken care of, we&rsquo;ll be so clear that the answer is obvious: the tariff. It helped build our nation and it can help rebuild it. The people against it are the same ones who support outsourcing of jobs and insourcing of workers. They have no credibility; they should be working as wash room attendants and shoe shine boys.</p>

  &#8220;If you will listen to the tape of Obama&rsquo;a statement that &ldquo;and another mistake is that this healthcare reform will support undocumented illegals&rdquo; you can hear the silence and the incredidulity in the crowd. Clearly no one not even Obama&rsquo;s supporters believed him.&#8221; <br>

		<p>2052 or even 42 are lies. The country as is cannot be more than 50% White now. The rates of miscegenation, particularly among our White women, are sky high. We need to stop denying this and saying &#8220;most White women prefer men of their own race.&#8221; It&rsquo;s simply not true. The country will be minority White in 10 years, and by 2052 I don&rsquo;t think any more than 20-25% of the population will be pure-blood European stock. Look around you, people.

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t watch Obama&rsquo;s brainwashing session, er, speech, but couldn&rsquo;t avoid excerpts of it on the news. What jumped out at me the first instant was in a sea of dark, dignified clothing, there was Ms. Pelosi, as part of the Democratic triangle on screen standing out in a bright red suit, calculated to draw the eye directly to her. That was no accident. But her expression at the outburst was priceless. She could have spit nails.</p>

All the ultraliberal white people I know, those who prattle on about how wonderful diversity and multiculturalism are, without exception they all live in lily-white neighborhoods.

		<p>Even if - EVEN IF - the new law prohibits this &#8220;free&#8221; health care for illegals, a US court of the type that has been stacked for decades with activist judges will merely declare the provision &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221;, as if the US Constitution contains any lines guaranteeing income-tax funded medical care for criminal alien invaders.</p>
<p>The &#8220;we pay consumption taxes&#8221; excuse is quite amusing, as these are almost entirely city and state sales taxes, which will contribute nothing whatever to a federally-funded medical program.  Whoever came up with that one is missing his true calling as a writer for The Onion.</p>

		<p>Two points.</p>
<p>(1)  The &#8220;legal&#8221; &#8220;illegal&#8221; distinction, while important, is woefully inadequate.  The U.S. born children of the illegal aliens are all United States citizens.  And because their parents usually have no offical income or assets, they are entitled to all of the Federal and State benefits available.  Citizens or not, these anchor babies aren&rsquo;t any more American than their parents.  </p>
<p>(2)  I actually agree with the thrust of the authors post:  diversity stifles cooperation.  And I do think white Americans are more resistant to social welfare programs because the resources will overwhelmingly be consumed by non-whites whose brethren haven&rsquo;t contributed in proportionately.  But whereas the author undoubtedly condemns this attitude as a problem for whites to &#8220;overcome&#8221;, I see it as an inescapable reality of life.  Diversity stifles cooperation and leaves society worse off.  The answer isn&rsquo;t more brainwashing, it&rsquo;s less diversity.</p>

Apparrently it is of interest to black people that there are places white people want to live that doesnt include dark people.  Its also a place were there is less crime, rape, assaults, stealing, illegitimacy, drop out rates and productivity is pretty high.  Help from a neighbor much more likeley then in the city.  And why is this upsetting to the blacks.  They keep saying that these are the cries of a white majority shrinking and that whites cant stand the future.  The laugh is that blacks think that a future white blacks as the majority is going to be as prosperous.  Look at Haiti.  Yet they are so dumb the sex like frenzy of excitment about whitey losing, has them jumping off a  cliff into the dark.  Have fun.</p>

<p>They see no contradiction to raving about the rights of the 3rd world, blacks, minorities, etc., but living in a place where blacks are virtually unknown &amp; hispanics still (believe it or not!) rare. </p>
<p>This is typical of progressive whites, who avoid blacks &amp; hispanics like the plague (by living in places where there are NONE) but moan about the lack of minorities in their towns as though it were a grave danger to the community.</p>
<p>we have to just keep confronting such people with the utter insanity of these contradictions.  </p>
<p>They do get upset (because the truth is scary), but in the long run, they will start to wake up to white minority staus, to the incredibly fragile status of European life in an asian and black etc. world.</p>
<p>Ps.: I live in Europe and my Euro friends are having children, so maybe there is hope. <br>

As the melting pot becomes more and more, well, melted, it&rsquo;s going to be harder and harder to tell who is White and who isn&rsquo;t and harder and harder to keep your daughters or sons away from, say, the Indian-&#8220;American&#8221; that watches too much porn and thinks White women are the standard for who he should be dating. I already know two well educated men, one black and the other Afghani, that pretty much take Aryan women as the standard. They don&rsquo;t even consider dating non-Whites. Luckily, they haven&rsquo;t been so lucky, only shacking up with non-Whites in college, praise the Lord. The White women I&rsquo;ve been with have all been racially aware, I imagine. In 10 or 20 years we&rsquo;re going to be seeing A LOT more horny quadroons and octoroons running around, and wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if your granddaughter was a genetic throwback and popped out black as coal and with a red afro and an IQ to boot. Come on, now. The idea is for total homogeneity in the face of global extinction. If you want to risk that living in a society of pseudo-Whites with low IQs and a society filled to the brim with minorities to whom the White woman is seen as the most beautiful exotic thing around, I&rsquo;m sure you would see the problem with being complacent.

<p>Bon voyage Conrad, you can go without me and my family because we&rsquo;re staying and taking back our country. Moving to a small geographic area in this nation would only make us even more vulnerable.  The miscegenation fad is greatly exaggerated by the media.

<p>What do they expect a sort of Phyrric victory over Whites?  Not that they would understand what that means.  Yeah, better to turn a blind eye to the violence against one&rsquo;s own people and keep seeking out that elusive White Bigot.</p>
<p>I wonder if they still are hoping for a latino-black coalition against Whitey?  From the looks of the racial wars around here, that will never happen.  When they are locked entirely out of jobs, cleansed from their neighborhoods, their children beaten up at the schools, the welfare handouts denied  &mdash;  will they still be blaming The Man?

By 2042 whites should be approx 20-25% of the total population if current trends continue. Furthermore, an unknown number of these &#8220;whites&#8221; will be high yella mestisos and mulattoes who will lack a full white personality. By the 100th year of the moon landing anniversary whites should be ~10-15% of the total US population.

<p>They sound remarkably  like white politicians, don&rsquo;t they?  Turns out they&rsquo;re all political prostitutes and  racial sell-outs in service to some other agenda which doesn&rsquo;t include their own people,  (and which they may not even comprehend).</p>
<p><b>When they are locked entirely out of jobs, cleansed from their neighborhoods, their children beaten up at school, the welfare handouts denied  &mdash;  will they still be blaming The Man?   I would wager YES.  </b></p>
<p>Quite likely.  But only so long as they continue to be controlled by the  Information Masters and the Opinion Shapers. It all depends on the media/academia axis and what it wants. They will call the tune. As usual.</p>

		<p>Hi, friends!  Conrad makes excellent points.  Non-Whites view Whites as a high status people.  Many would love to have Whites absorbed into their gene pool to increase their social status, intelligence, looks and creativity.  It is a win-win for them, and a lose-lose for us.  </p>
<p>We must have our own territory to ensure our survival.  The second thing we need to do is teach our children the importance of White genetic survival.</p>
<p>I remember reading months back about a village in Mexico that was established by fleeing Confederate families after the American Civil War.  For generations they spoke English and tried to hold onto their White Southern culture.  Gradually their children married Mexicans and now there are approximately two people descended from these immigrants that are still 100% White.  We must not let that happen to us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As it becomes more diverse the probability of socialism being voted in increases while the probability of socialism succeeding decreases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly, you&rsquo;ve pin-pointed the decline of the West in a nutshell. The economic neoliberalism of Reagan and Thatcher could only last as long as whites were in a clear majority. Now whites are becoming a minority there is nothing to stop the takeover by anti-white socialist governments and nothing to stop them failing either.</p>
<p>Unless there is a sea-change in elite opinion within the next ten years, the only options will be to follow a separatist or federalist response.<br>

		<p>Conrad sees whats happening when whites become a visible minority. When whites become too few to form their own clique the bulk of them assimilate into the brown majority except for a few diehards. That is primarily why I think the USA will have 0% whites left by 2100. There will be people who call and think of themselves as white, but they will be more like north africans than europeans, both in looks and in mental profile. </p>

<p>I recall reading a book about the Dominican Republic some years ago. It mentioned that there were still some white hold-outs in remote places who remain determined to preserve their whiteness and who refused to inter-marry with the rest of the miscegenated population. They were only a few in numbers and were limited to intermarrying among themselves, often their own cousins.  Naturally, there were a lot of genetic defects among them and some of them were very odd looking.  Is that to be our fate? </p>
