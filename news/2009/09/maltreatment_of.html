			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News International (Karachi), September 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Adviser to Sindh Chief Minister Sharmila Farooqui has asked City Nazim Syed Mustafa Kamal and IGP Sindh to take notice of the alleged maltreatment of eunuchs by the city wardens and Sindh police.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eunuchs are Pakistani nationals and a part of a respectable society. Any kind of highhandedness, torture and sexual assault on them is an inhuman act. This will not be tolerated at any cost. The city nazim and IGP Sindh should provide security and facilities to them in view of the recent Supreme Court order,&#8221; read a statement issued by her on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CDGK officials and police have been misbehaving with eunuchs and during the protest on Friday, a eunuch reported that some personnel of Sindh police kidnapped him and took him to the National Highway where he was sexually assaulted by them and was also robbed of his money,&#8221; Sharmilla said. She also asked the city nazim and IGP Sindh to conduct a probe into the issue and award punishment to those found guilty.<br>

		<p>In all fairness, these eunuchs may be elderly men who were born when Pakistan was under British rule. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the practice exists today (although I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it did, at least in some rural areas). If they are younger, then this article provides one more reason why Pakistanis should be excluded from every nation in the Western world. And the actions of the local police are inexcusable, regardless of anything else.</p>

		<p>Eunuchs were created to work in moslem upper class households where there were lots women-wives,and concubines,slaves.I will run this by my Packistan advisor-she will know,as her family went to pakistan during the partition.I agree that this could still be practiced in the remote moslem tribal areas-along with dozens of other wierd things that you will not beleive..ie honour killing for a start..Now you know one of the things that will be coming to your neighbourhood with the religion of peace..</p>

		<p>Hmmmm - the last time I heard of castration being permissible was in the 18th and 19th centuries, in Italy and other European music capitals, wherein a boy with a promising singing voice could be castrated, sometimes by his own father, in order to produce a &#8220;castrato&#8221; - a male who could sing in the soprano range with the power generated from a male chest.  Often these boys did not develop the desired singing voice, and spent the rest of their lives as mutilated, unhappy members of society.  I doubt very much that singing was the objective of rendering current Pakistanis eunuchs; maybe THEY castrate first time child rapist offenders!!  If so, I applaud it.  Otherwise - who knows!!</p>

		<p>Right, exactly, young boys castrated, [all the appendages taken off totally in the Chinese case] to be used as household workers for upper class families or royalty, any degree of nobility for that matter. Life time servants, not exactly a slave but close to it, if not so. The Chinese had 2,000 years experience with eunuchs and made the observation that eunuchs lived for seven years longer than the average male and did not develop male pattern baldness. Islamic slavery of black African males followed the same procedure, it being estimated that about 95 % of the unfortunates died in the &#8220;procudure&#8221; to create the eunuch. Yee-ouch. Genghis Khan was defeated only twice during his military career, once at the hands of Chinese eunuch general - - the shame of it! These Pakistani eunuchs have to be quite old now, it being more than sixty years since the partition of the Raj?</p>

<p><b>TEAM OF PAKISTANI EUNUCHS WIN THEIR INAUGURAL CRICKET MATCH</b></p>
<p>bbc.co.uk <br>
18-Aug-2009<br>
 <br>
The eunuchs said they felt greatly appreciated by the crowd. Eunuchs in Pakistan have won what is believed to be the first cricket match their team has ever played in the country. Their opponents were &#8220;normal&#8221; young men from a local cricket club in the southern city of Sukkur. Eunuchs - or castrated men - are seen as social outcasts by Pakistan&rsquo;s largely conservative Islamic society, which has ignored them over the years. They mostly earn their living as dancers, sex workers and by begging.<br>

		<p>There are only four castes in traditional India, although there are sub-castes in certain areas.  &#8220;Eunuch&#8221; is not one of the main castes.  And, well, there are the sudras - the untouchables.  They aren&rsquo;t eunuchs either.  So, unless eunuchs were a sub-caste within a certain area, I don&rsquo;t believe they would be classed as a separate caste all to themselves.  As I recall, the highest caste is the Brahmin - highly educated, professional, wealthy; next is the warrior caste, as in Arjuna from the Bhagavad-Gita; third is the shopkeeper caste, and last is the servant caste.  None of these is for eunuchs.  So I don&rsquo;t know where that comment about eunuchs being a caste came from.</p>

<p>From what I read they are considered a special cast. These boys usually realize at a young age that they want to be female, or sometimes they are born transgendered (hermaphrodites or whatever).</p>
<p>They leave home, or are cast out, and find others to initiate them into the caste. Unlike other countries where the families sell or castrate their sons to work as sex workers or servants, in India the families often don&rsquo;t like it when their sons go this route as it can make it harder for siblings to marry (lowers the value of siblings).</p>
<p>Kind of an interesting phenomina with very old roots as these boys choose it based on their own sexuality, which is not at all like eunichs from other cultures where it is typically forced upon them for one reason or another.</p>

Maltreatment of eunuchs is forbidden?<br>
Question: How did they get to be eunuchs in the first place?<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it a little late to be worrying about their wellbeing?</p>

<p>As young men, within the Islamic world, are called &#8220;pretty boys&#8221;? And when earning a living as a dancer, imitating the dance style of a female?</p>
<p>Sex workers for men. The great Sir Richard Francis Burton first made a name for himself when as a Captain in the British Indian Army, investigated the reports that English officers were frequenting the male brothels of Karachi.</p>
<p>The Muslims like to claim they are so pure and uncorrupted. But it is false. They go for the opiate taking [no alcohol] and the male-male sex and buy concubines and such.</p>

<p>Uhhh&hellip;Islam forbids castration, that is why most eunich slaves were imported from Africa (they were castrated in the field). Apparently Islam does not forbid buying or owning a castrated slave, but it does prohibit making one. </p>
<p>The Paki eunichs appear to have nothing to do with Islam, they are Indian/Hindu.</p>

<p>That is correct.  It is forbitten for a Moslem to do.   But otherwise,  Islam does not have anything against the practice   &mdash;   when done by someone else. That is why the task was assigned to a Christian or Jew.   A Moslem could not create a eunuch, but he could own one.  And many did.  Therin lies the hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Also, it was/is forbidden to castrate a Moslem. But castrating infidels was/is entirely permissible.</p>

		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t pointing out whether Islam does or does not create eunuchs (they say they don&rsquo;t) but that eunuchs have long been tolerated in Muslim societies. But like slavery and a million other things they are in denial about any wrongdoing on their part.</p>

		<p>Dear DixieProud,</p>
<p>The four groupings of society from the Gita that you are talking about are actually varna, or classes. Most Hindus also belong to a smaller grouping that is a true caste, and is usually based on livelihood.  There are hundreds, maybe thousands of castes.  </p>

		<p>Whether or not Islam condones castration, is beside the point.  Muslim slave traders have been practicing it on sub-Saharan Africans for centuries right up until the present day.  Since 7th century Arab slavery still persists in parts of Africa today such as the Sudan, for example, no doubt so does castration.</p>
