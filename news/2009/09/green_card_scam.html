			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Duggan, Washington Post, September 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The beating death of a pizzeria owner in Northeast Washington two weeks ago was tied to an immigration scam in which the victim had agreed to pay a Maryland woman $500 a week to marry his brother, then reneged on the deal after the wedding, a witness told D.C. police.</p>
<p>At first, the slaying of Shahabuddin Rana, 44, inside his Pizza Mart in the 2300 block of Fourth Street NE appeared to have stemmed from a conventional robbery, police said. But they said a bizarre story took shape in the days afterward, leading to the arrest Friday of Shanika Robinson, 26, of Capitol Heights.</p>
<p>In an affidavit filed in D.C. Superior Court, Detective Robert Cephas said a witness told him that Rana had been paying Robinson to continue in a sham marriage with his brother, a Pakistani national who helps run the Pizza Mart in the Edgewood neighborhood. The scheme was intended to improve the brother&rsquo;s immigration status and help him eventually get his green card, the affidavit says.</p>
<p>The deal fell apart, however, after the brother, whom police have not publicly identified, found out that Robinson &#8220;was having sexual affairs,&#8221; Cephas wrote. Even though the brother and Robinson were married only on paper and did not live together, Rana &#8220;became upset&#8221; with Robinson and told her &#8220;that she would not be getting paid the money that they agreed upon anymore,&#8221; the affidavit says.</p>
<p>Robinson, accompanied by three men, allegedly confronted Rana while he was alone in the 24-hour pizzeria late Aug. 17 or early Aug. 18. Police said his assailants slashed and beat Rana, fracturing his skull in several places, then tried to burn his body before fleeing with about $2,000 in cash and packages of Newport cigarettes and Dutch Masters and Black and Mild cigars.</p>

		<p>I think I may have finally justified my existence. I was at the beach watching TV with another guest when they played that famous video  sucker punching of a customer by a thug and his girlfriend at the pizza parlor. The one where all the White guys cowered two feet away. I was able to guide my friend toward the right conclusion by doing nothing more than agreeing with what he verbalized. Then I told him, &#8220;I`ll bet a whole lot more people think like you and me, but we never get to hear em.&#8221; I really think he became aware  this weekend.</p>

		<p>It is sickening how so much of the food service sector has been turned into a gateway for foreign migrants.</p>
<p>They do much of their business in cash, with ample opportunity to hide money and launder the proceeds of drug dealing.  </p>
<p>Many of these businesses have a revolving door when it comes to employees, acting as a bridgehead for brothers, cousins, and countrymen from abroad.  As soom as they have their citizenship, off they go and more come to take their place.</p>
<p>Most egregious is the whites who buy their slop, enabling the pizzarias and sandwich joints to continue.</p>

		<p>Wonderful news, Tim!  </p>
<p>Be gentle for the first few days and weeks because he will be emotionally ungrounded and (on one level) anxious to return to safe mental states. </p>
<p>Any sudden unveiling of your deepest feelings, which are based on years of study and reflection may overwhelm him and give him a reason to backslide.</p>

		<p>Receives no sympathy from me. Scamming Americans by setting up fake marriages which is all too common with these 3rd worlders coming into America. And we still do nothing&hellip;&hellip;thanks Teddy for setting this all up in 1965.</p>

		<p>The victim was a Pakistani who was seeking to scam my nation, as for the guilty party, well, her name was Shanika Robinson. Why would anybody in their right mind hire a black woman (probably from the ghetto) to carry out a deal involving both money and trust (which usually go together anyway)? But then again, nobody involved was &#8220;in their right mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Could the situation have been resolved better? Sadly no, we can&rsquo;t expect much from these type of people. Do I feel sorry for what happened? I feel sorry only for the fact that my nation has sunk so low as to willingly accept people like those described in the article within her borders.</p>

 A more succinct or perfect parable of modern America is hard to find.</p>

		<p>I doubt very much that the Rana brothers intended to go on paying<br>
Shanika $500.00 per week for very long after the wedding.</p>
<p>This is a typical immigrant scam.  They offer say, $10,000 for the 2 year marriage required by ICE.  The American is hooked and then finds that there will be only a down payment before the wedding and then weekly or monthly payments.</p>
<p>But a month after the wedding the payments stop.  What is the American to do?  Report the arrangement as fraud (which legally it is) and admit to committing immigration fraud?</p>
<p>But this immigrant took advantage of the wrong American.</p>
<p>This particular practice, small down payment and then nothing is the way all these immigrants operate in every possible thing.  Tell an employee they&rsquo;ll pay them next week.  Tell the landlord they will pay them next month.  O</p>
<p>rder goods, take delivery with a rubber check at an accomodation address and move the goods to to their real store. Take the customers money, tell him the goods will be delivered in 10 to 14 days, close up shop and depart for your uncle&rsquo;s store across town. 2 Weeks later, go back to the store with new signs a new business name.  Laugh as the customer tries to track you down.</p>
<p>Buy a gas station and rig the cash register to allow you to invade the bank accounts of the debit cards and clear out your customers bank account.  Use the credit cards to buy all sorts of expensive easily sold items like laptops, DVD players etc and sell them.</p>
<p>Never pay a dime of taxes.  Use false names for everything so you can cheat landlord after landlord as you move your criminal enterprise disguised as a business every 6 months.</p>
<p>Want to be a contractor?  Just look in the yellow pages of a city about 50 miles away.  Look at the contractors ads.  You will see their valid contractors license number at the bottom of the ad.  Look at their ad.  Go to Kinko&rsquo;s and get business cards, stationery, fliers etc using the contractors name and license number and you&rsquo;re in business.</p>
<p>When you take off a roof and have no idea how to replace it, simply disappear leaving the American contractor whose name and license number you have stolen to be sued by the irate customer.</p>
<p>It goes on and on.  So many American businesses have left California because they can&rsquo;t compete with the mafia like tactics of the immigrants. </p>

		<p>Tim, I saw that video too. I think anyone who sees it could predict what would happen including the crowd response. Sheeple is the best term I have heard in 10 years.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t have any tools?  Get on a big job with a lot of subcontractors and steal your fellow contractors tools. Come back with a big truck at night and steal all the materials.<br>
