<h1>See Baby Discriminate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman, Newsweek, September 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At the Children&rsquo;s Research Lab at the University of Texas, a database is kept on thousands of families in the Austin area who have volunteered to be available for scholarly research. In 2006 Birgitte Vittrup recruited from the database about a hundred families, all of whom were Caucasian with a child 5 to 7 years old.</p>
<p>The goal of Vittrup&rsquo;s study was to learn if typical children&rsquo;s videos with multicultural storylines have any beneficial effect on children&rsquo;s racial attitudes. Her first step was to give the children a Racial Attitude Measure, which asked such questions as:</p>
<p>How many White people are nice?</p>
<p>(Almost all) (A lot) (Some) (Not many) (None)</p>
<p>How many Black people are nice?</p>
<p>(Almost all) (A lot) (Some) (Not many) (None)</p>
<p>During the test, the descriptive adjective &#8220;nice&#8221; was replaced with more than 20 other adjectives, like &#8220;dishonest,&#8221; &#8220;pretty,&#8221; &#8220;curious,&#8221; and &#8220;snobby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vittrup sent a third of the families home with multiculturally themed videos for a week, such as an episode of Sesame Streetin which characters visit an African-American family&rsquo;s home, and an episode of Little Bill, where the entire neighborhood comes together to clean the local park.</p>
<p>In truth, Vittrup didn&rsquo;t expect that children&rsquo;s racial attitudes would change very much just from watching these videos. Prior research had shown that multicultural curricula in schools have far less impact than we intend them to  &mdash;  largely because the implicit message &#8220;We&rsquo;re all friends&#8221; is too vague for young children to understand that it refers to skin color.</p>
<p>Yet Vittrup figured explicit conversations with parents could change that. So a second group of families got the videos, and Vittrup told these parents to use them as the jumping-off point for a discussion about interracial friendship. She provided a checklist of points to make, echoing the shows&rsquo; themes. &#8220;I really believed it was going to work,&#8221; Vittrup recalls.</p>
<p>The last third were also given the checklist of topics, but no videos. These parents were to discuss racial equality on their own, every night for five nights.</p>
<p>At this point, something interesting happened. Five families in the last group abruptly quit the study. Two directly told Vittrup, &#8220;We don&rsquo;t want to have these conversations with our child. We don&rsquo;t want to point out skin color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vittrup was taken aback  &mdash;  these families volunteered knowing full well it was a study of children&rsquo;s racial attitudes. Yet once they were aware that the study required talking openly about race, they started dropping out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They wanted their children to grow up colorblind. But Vittrup&rsquo;s first test of the kids revealed they weren&rsquo;t colorblind at all. Asked how many white people are mean, these children commonly answered, &#8220;Almost none.&#8221; Asked how many blacks are mean, many answered, &#8220;Some,&#8221; or &#8220;A lot.&#8221; Even kids who attended diverse schools answered the questions this way.</p>
<p>More disturbing, Vittrup also asked all the kids a very blunt question: &#8220;Do your parents like black people?&#8221; Fourteen percent said outright, &#8220;No, my parents don&rsquo;t like black people&#8221;; 38 percent of the kids answered, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know.&#8221; In this supposed race-free vacuum being created by parents, kids were left to improvise their own conclusions  &mdash;  many of which would be abhorrent to their parents.</p>
<p>Vittrup hoped the families she&rsquo;d instructed to talk about race would follow through. After watching the videos, the families returned to the Children&rsquo;s Research Lab for retesting. To Vittrup&rsquo;s complete surprise, the three groups of children were statistically the same  &mdash;  none, as a group, had budged very much in their racial attitudes. At first glance, the study was a failure.</p>
<p>Combing through the parents&rsquo; study diaries, Vittrup realized why. Diary after diary revealed that the parents barely mentioned the checklist items. Many just couldn&rsquo;t talk about race, and they quickly reverted to the vague &#8220;Everybody&rsquo;s equal&#8221; phrasing.</p>
<p>Of all those Vittrup told to talk openly about interracial friendship, only six families managed to actually do so. And, for all six, their children dramatically improved their racial attitudes in a single week. Talking about race was clearly key. Reflecting later about the study, Vittrup said, &#8220;A lot of parents came to me afterwards and admitted they just didn&rsquo;t know what to say to their kids, and they didn&rsquo;t want the wrong thing coming out of the mouth of their kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For decades, it was assumed that children see race only when society points it out to them. However, child-development researchers have increasingly begun to question that presumption. They argue that children see racial differences as much as they see the difference between pink and blue  &mdash;  but we tell kids that &#8220;pink&#8221; means for girls and &#8220;blue&#8221; is for boys. &#8220;White&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; are mysteries we leave them to figure out on their own.</p>
<p>It takes remarkably little for children to develop in-group preferences. Vittrup&rsquo;s mentor at the University of Texas, Rebecca Bigler, ran an experiment in three preschool classrooms, where 4- and 5-year-olds were lined up and given T shirts. Half the kids were randomly given blue T shirts, half red. The children wore the shirts for three weeks. During that time, the teachers never mentioned their colors and never grouped the kids by shirt color.</p>
<p>The kids didn&rsquo;t segregate in their behavior. They played with each other freely at recess. But when asked which color team was better to belong to, or which team might win a race, they chose their own color. They believed they were smarter than the other color. &#8220;The Reds never showed hatred for Blues,&#8221; Bigler observed. &#8220;It was more like, &#8216;Blues are fine, but not as good as us.&rsquo;&#8221; When Reds were asked how many Reds were nice, they&rsquo;d answer, &#8220;All of us.&#8221; Asked how many Blues were nice, they&rsquo;d answer, &#8220;Some.&#8221; Some of the Blues were mean, and some were dumb  &mdash;  but not the Reds.</p>
<p>Bigler&rsquo;s experiment seems to show how children will use whatever you give them to create divisions  &mdash;  seeming to confirm that race becomes an issue only if we make it an issue. So why does Bigler think it&rsquo;s important to talk to children about race as early as the age of 3?</p>
<p>Her reasoning is that kids are developmentally prone to in-group favoritism; they&rsquo;re going to form these preferences on their own. Children naturally try to categorize everything, and the attribute they rely on is that which is the most clearly visible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>How do researchers test a 6-month-old? They show babies photographs of faces. Katz [Phyllis Katz, then a professor at the University of Colorado] found that babies will stare significantly longer at photographs of faces that are a different race from their parents, indicating they find the face out of the ordinary. Race itself has no ethnic meaning per se  &mdash;  but children&rsquo;s brains are noticing skin-color differences and trying to understand their meaning.</p>
<p>When the kids turned 3, Katz showed them photographs of other children and asked them to choose whom they&rsquo;d like to have as friends. Of the white children, 86 percent picked children of their own race. When the kids were 5 and 6, Katz gave these children a small deck of cards, with drawings of people on them. Katz told the children to sort the cards into two piles any way they wanted. Only 16 percent of the kids used gender to split the piles. But 68 percent of the kids used race to split the cards, without any prompting. In reporting her findings, Katz concluded: &#8220;I think it is fair to say that at no point in the study did the children exhibit the Rousseau type of color-blindness that many adults expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>The point Katz emphasizes is that this period of our children&rsquo;s lives, when we imagine it&rsquo;s most important to not talk about race, is the very developmental period when children&rsquo;s minds are forming their first conclusions about race.</p>
<p>Several studies point to the possibility of developmental windows  &mdash;  stages when children&rsquo;s attitudes might be most amenable to change. In one experiment, children were put in cross-race study groups, and then were observed on the playground to see if the interracial classroom time led to interracial play at recess. The researchers found mixed study groups worked wonders with the first-grade children, but it made no difference with third graders. It&rsquo;s possible that by third grade, when parents usually recognize it&rsquo;s safe to start talking a little about race, the developmental window has already closed.</p>
<p>The other deeply held assumption modern parents have is what Ashley and I have come to call the Diverse Environment Theory. If you raise a child with a fair amount of exposure to people of other races and cultures, the environment becomes the message. Because both of us attended integrated schools in the 1970s  &mdash;  Ashley in San Diego and, in my case, Seattle  &mdash;  we had always accepted this theory&rsquo;s tenets: diversity breeds tolerance, and talking about race was, in and of itself, a diffuse kind of racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Diverse Environment Theory is the core principle behind school desegregation today. Like most people, I assumed that after 30 years of desegregation, it would have a long track record of scientific research proving that the Diverse Environment Theory works. Then Ashley and I began talking to the scholars who&rsquo;ve compiled that very research.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2007, led by the Civil Rights Project, a dozen scholars wrote an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting school desegregation in Louisville, Ky., and Seattle. By the time the brief reached the court, 553 scientists had signed on in support. However, as much as the scientists all supported active desegregation, the brief is surprisingly circumspect in its advocacy: the benefits of desegregation are qualified with words like &#8220;may lead&#8221; and &#8220;can improve.&#8221; &#8220;Mere school integration is not a panacea,&#8221; the brief warns.</p>
<p>UT&rsquo;s Bigler was one of the scholars heavily involved in the process of its creation. Bigler is an adamant proponent of desegregation in schools on moral grounds. &#8220;It&rsquo;s an enormous step backward to increase social segregation,&#8221; she says. However, she also admitted that &#8220;in the end, I was disappointed with the amount of evidence social psychology could muster [to support it]. Going to integrated schools gives you just as many chances to learn stereotypes as to unlearn them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unfortunate twist of diverse schools is that they don&rsquo;t necessarily lead to more cross-race relationships. Often it&rsquo;s the opposite. Duke University&rsquo;s James Moody  &mdash;  an expert on how adolescents form and maintain social networks  &mdash;  analyzed data on more than 90,000 teenagers at 112 different schools from every region of the country. {snip}</p>
<p>Moody found that the more diverse the school, the more the kids self-segregate by race and ethnicity within the school, and thus the likelihood that any two kids of different races have a friendship goes down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a result, junior-high and high-school children in diverse schools experience two completely contrasting social cues on a daily basis. The first cue is inspiring  &mdash;  that many students have a friend of another race. The second cue is tragic  &mdash;  that far more kids just like to hang with their own. It&rsquo;s this second dynamic that becomes more and more visible as overall school diversity goes up. {snip}</p>
<p>All told, the odds of a white high-schooler in America having a best friend of another race is only 8 percent. Those odds barely improve for the second-best friend, or the third-best, or the fifth. For blacks, the odds aren&rsquo;t much better: 85 percent of black kids&rsquo; best friends are also black. Cross-race friends also tend to share a single activity, rather than multiple activities; as a result, these friendships are more likely to be lost over time, as children transition from middle school to high school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bigler ran a study in which children read brief biographies of famous African-Americans. For instance, in a biography of Jackie Robinson, they read that he was the first African-American in the major leagues. But only half read about how he&rsquo;d previously been relegated to the Negro Leagues, and how he suffered taunts from white fans. Those facts  &mdash;  in five brief sentences were omitted in the version given to the other children.</p>
<p>After the two-week history class, the children were surveyed on their racial attitudes. White children who got the full story about historical discrimination had significantly better attitudes toward blacks than those who got the neutered version. Explicitness works. &#8220;It also made them feel some guilt,&#8221; Bigler adds. &#8220;It knocked down their glorified view of white people.&#8221; They couldn&rsquo;t justify in-group superiority.</p>
<p>Minority parents are more likely to help their children develop a racial identity from a young age. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Preparation for bias is not, however, the only way minorities talk to their children about race. The other broad category of conversation, in Harris-Britt&rsquo;s [April Harris-Britt, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill] analysis, is ethnic pride. From a very young age, minority children are coached to be proud of their ethnic history. She found that this was exceedingly good for children&rsquo;s self-confidence; in one study, black children who&rsquo;d heard messages of ethnic pride were more engaged in school and more likely to attribute their success to their effort and ability.</p>
<p>That leads to the question that everyone wonders but rarely dares to ask. If &#8220;black pride&#8221; is good for African-American children, where does that leave white children? It&rsquo;s horrifying to imagine kids being &#8220;proud to be white.&#8221; Yet many scholars argue that&rsquo;s exactly what children&rsquo;s brains are already computing. Just as minority children are aware that they belong to an ethnic group with less status and wealth, most white children naturally decipher that they belong to the race that has more power, wealth, and control in society; this provides security, if not confidence. So a pride message would not just be abhorrent  &mdash;  it&rsquo;d be redundant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the story that most affected us came from a small town in rural Ohio. Two first-grade teachers, Joy Bowman and Angela Johnson, had agreed to let a professor from Ohio State University, Jeane Copenhaver-Johnson, observe their classrooms for the year. Of the 33 children, about two thirds were white, while the others were black or of mixed-race descent.</p>
<p>It being December, the teachers had decided to read to their classes &#8216;Twas the Night B&rsquo;fore Christmas, Melodye Rosales&rsquo;s retelling of the Clement C. Moore classic. As the teachers began reading, the kids were excited by the book&rsquo;s depiction of a family waiting for Santa to come. A few children, however, quietly fidgeted. They seemed puzzled that this storybook was different: in this one, it was a black family all snug in their beds.</p>
<p>Then there was the famed clatter on the roof. The children leaned in to get their first view of Santa and the sleigh as Johnson turned the page  &mdash;  </p>
<p>And they saw that Santa was black.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s black!&#8221; gasped a white little girl.</p>
<p>A white boy exclaimed, &#8220;I thought he was white!&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately, the children began to chatter about the stunning development. At the ripe old ages of 6 and 7, the children had no doubt that there was a Real Santa. Of that they were absolutely sure. But suddenly there was this huge question mark. Could Santa be black? And if so, what did that mean?</p>
<p>While some of the black children were delighted with the idea that Santa could be black, others were unsure. A couple of the white children rejected this idea out of hand: a black Santa couldn&rsquo;t be real.</p>
<p>But even the little girl the most adamant that the Real Santa must be white came around to accept the possibility that a black Santa could fill in for White Santa if he was hurt. And she still gleefully yelled along with the Black Santa&rsquo;s final &#8220;Merry Christmas to All! Y&rsquo;all Sleep Tight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other children offered the idea that perhaps Santa was &#8220;mixed with black and white&#8221;  &mdash;  something in the middle, like an Indian. One boy went with a two-Santa hypothesis: White Santa and Black Santa must be friends who take turns visiting children. When a teacher made the apparently huge mistake of saying that she&rsquo;d never seen Santa, the children all quickly corrected her: everyone had seen Santa at the mall. Not that that clarified the situation any.</p>
<p>The debate raged for a week, in anticipation of a school party. The kids all knew Real Santa was the guest of honor.</p>
<p>Then Santa arrived at the party  &mdash;  and he was black. Just like in the picture book.</p>
<p>Some white children said that this black Santa was too thin: that meant that the Real Santa was the fat white one at Kmart. But one of the white girls retorted that she had met the man and was convinced. Santa was brown.</p>
<p>Most of the black children were exultant, since this proved that Santa was black. But one of them, Brent, still doubted  &mdash;  even though he really wanted a black Santa to be true. So he bravely confronted Santa.</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&rsquo;t no black Santas!&#8221; Brent insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lookit here.&#8221; Santa pulled up a pant leg.</p>
<p>A thrilled Brent was sold. &#8220;This is a black Santa!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;He&rsquo;s got black skin and his black boots are like the white Santa&rsquo;s boots.&#8221;</p>
<p>A black-Santa storybook wasn&rsquo;t enough to crush every stereotype. When Johnson later asked the kids to draw Santa, even the black kids who were excited about a black Santa still depicted him with skin as snowy white as his beard.</p>

		<p>The above article is proof of the insanity that is going on today in academia. Where issues of race, genetics, culture, are concerned, the official censorship of the findings in the many fields that study these things has become so embarrasing, that some of the researchers can no longer stand it and have actually made protests against it. I read that one cognitive scientist said he has been putting up with it for some forty years.</p>

		<p>Most kids will &#8216;read&rsquo; the questioner, and attempt to answer what they think will be the &#8216;right&rsquo; or expected answer.</p>
<p>The facial expression of the questioner, the inflection in the voice, the framing of the question - these are clues that kids pick up on.</p>
<p>Most of all, the experiment is flawed in what it is trying to achieve - old-fashioned brainwashing. Even a child can see through that.</p>

		<p>Santa Claus is white.  It is a white persons story.  If a black can not enjoy a story written by a white author about a white family waiting for white Santa too bad.</p>
<p>And this garbage about wanting to make white kids feel quilty about something they had nothing to do with, as well as the statement that it is abhorent for a white child to feel pride in his European-American heritage is just cultural genocide.</p>

		<p>When I was a little kid back in the &rsquo;70s, I was an unwitting participant in these social experiments. I had no problems reading interesting stories about nonwhites as long they were randomly mixed in with stories about Whites. My problems began when the protagonist&rsquo;s race or gender was emphasized, or described how horrible white people were. </p>
<p>I was such a good, little, colorblind teenaged liberal.</p>
<p>What was the result of all of that indoctrination? Well, here I am. I&rsquo;ve been reading Amren, Vdare, and Newnation for almost as long as those websites have existed. </p>
<p>Bronson and Merryman had better be careful. The greater &#8220;The Lie&#8221;, the angrier people are when they discover the truth. I just shake my head when I read statements such as &#8220;Young people are far more tolerant about race than ever before.&#8221; </p>
<p>My views on race are now a total 180° from what they were when I was 18. </p>

		<p>Rousseau? I wonder if these throwbacks have any clue how watped it is to force such agitprop on children. If over 2/3&rsquo;s of kindergarten kids recognize race as a separating factor, why can&rsquo;t adults accept it as a biological norm and focus on building a society that is healthy for whites like themselves.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;and an episode of Little Bill, where the entire neighborhood comes together to clean the local park.&#8221;</p>
<p>How absurd!!! An accurate program would show blacks littering and trashing the park and the all-white community volunteers cleaning it up on Saturday.</p>
<p>This article is the best illustration of a fixation that borders on mental illness I have seen in a long time. The children are just fine; it is the researchers and academics in this article that need long-term, in-patient psychotherapy to treat their obsession.</p>
<p>Notice the totalitarian tone of the article. Any children who do not display the &#8216;approved&rsquo; racial attitudes of the researchers are branded as somehow deficient and in need of &#8216;corrective&rsquo; measures.</p>
<p>Pre-school children recognize basic realities that Ph.D.&rsquo;s in our universities refuse to acknowledge out of ideological blindness.</p>
<p>In a more just world these researchers would be imprisoned for psychological abuse and malicious ideological programming of other people&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>My children will be taught that brown children are different. And any snippity little feminist academic twit who sends a journal home is going to find out exactly what the score is.</p>
<p>All the more important to keep classic (beware of newer &#8216;retold by&rsquo; versions) kids literature at home with the ORIGINAL illustrations. The multicult propaganda of today&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s literature has to be counteracted with the real stuff.</p>
<p>Note to multicultural eductors and researchers: KIDS REJECT YOUR IDEOLOGICAL PROGRAMMING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT JIBE WITH REALITY!</p>
<p>I could submit a hundred comments for this one.</p>

		<p>I actually read this tripe through(I should get a prize of some sort). These people behind these supposed studies should be put in a padded room and heavily sedated for their own good.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read Newsweek in years. They should be ashamed of themselves for putting such nonsense in their once excellent magazine.</p>

		<p> These two authors have to be about as clueless as any that I&rsquo;ve ever read, on the subject of race. If babies six months old notice a difference in racial characteristics, then it means that, Yes, Virginia, there is such a thing as race.</p>
<p> And why was this group from Austin that was chosen for the study entirely Caucasian? Is the implication that racism is a &#8220;disease&#8221; only suffered by White people, which we must be &#8220;cured of,&#8221; whether we want to be or not?</p>
<p> Racial Attitude Measure, my foot! I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the attitudes ABOUT race held by these two people   &mdash;   card-carrying bleeding-heart White liberals, if I&rsquo;m a foot high   &mdash;   that need to be measured. And regarding the article as a whole, I can&rsquo;t believe Newsweek wasted that much space and ink on this addle-pated tale. Then again, being familiar with Newsweek as I am, yes, I CAN believe it. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry boys and girls, Santa is white.  So is the tooth fairy.  They are a part of our culture and we made them in our image.  There is nothing wrong with this.  I wish black folks would stop changing OUR culture and stop saying our inventions are theirs.  The fact that they even change the face of Santa proves they are embedded with racism.<br>

		<p><i>Going to integrated schools gives you just as many chances to learn stereotypes as to unlearn them.</i></p>
<p>We have plenty of people right here who could elaborate on that experience at length.</p>
<p><i>It&rsquo;s horrifying to imagine kids being &#8220;proud to be white.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrifying to think that many white people will continue to subscribe to Newsweek even after they publish anti-white hatred like this.</p>
<p><i>After the two-week history class, the children were surveyed on their racial attitudes. White children who got the full story about historical discrimination had significantly better attitudes toward blacks than those who got the neutered version. Explicitness works. &#8220;It also made them feel some guilt,&#8221; Bigler adds. &#8220;It knocked down their glorified view of white people.&#8221; They couldn&rsquo;t justify in-group superiority.</i></p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;ve got to teach white kids to be guilty as early as possible.  Another excellent reason to home school your kids, and keep them away from the &#8220;professionals&#8221;.  You&rsquo;d better not tell the kids about Volta, Franklin, Faraday, Maxwell, Tesla, Galileo, Newton, Gauss, Planck, Bohr, Einstein, Schroedinger, Heisenberg,<br>
Darwin, Watson, Crick, etc., etc. because each of those men did things far more important than hit a ball with a bat and they&rsquo;re all white.  We wouldn&rsquo;t want those white kids getting any sense of pride about the accomplishments of their people.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;Just as minority children are aware that they belong to an ethnic group with less status and wealth, most white children naturally decipher that they belong to the race that has more power, wealth, and control in society; this provides security, if not confidence. So a pride message would not just be abhorrent &mdash; it&rsquo;d be redundant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And right here, we have a prime example of why this article and the so-called &ldquo;research&rdquo; it contains, are as abjectly worthless as these two abusive white child hating Red gutter whores Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman are. If one enters into studies or a review of them with assumptions such as these, all interpretations of the data are going to be biased. After all, operating on similar reverse assumptions would indicate that racial pride for blacks is not only misguided, but also a catalyst for future frustration and violence. Considering that blacks have less status and openly recognize this (and here we will assume that it is deserved because of inherent inferiority, just as the two Red gutter whores assume that for whites their &ldquo;unearned&rdquo; status is a function of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and other such nonsense) black racial pride should be strenuously discouraged from the time they leave the womb logically. Moreover, any white who would offer alternatives to these assumptions, should be ostracized fully from both professional life/organizations and everyday life/communities without exception.</p>

Why should white kids of today feel guilty about something over 60 years in the past? What is Bigler&rsquo;s real mission? I think we know. And Katz remarking that we should literally be hammering 3 year olds about race. Sure. No doubt he and his cronies want custody of your kid, to teach them to think properly, as it seems that the unending brainwashing over the last 7 decades hasn&rsquo;t quite been able to extinguish healthy instincts before the kid leaves the womb. </p>

		<p>The old adage, &#8220;Do as I say but not as I do,&#8221; proves true here.  What matters with the kids is the concrete, living example - and the black kids whose parents talked about racial pride and acted like they were proud to be black - these kids had the better self image.  I don&rsquo;t see why white kids couldn&rsquo;t be taught to be proud of who they are; &#8220;white&#8221; usually means descendents of European forebears from many different countries.  I know that kids who celebrate being Irish or Scottish or Italian generally have a higher self-image than white kids who don&rsquo;t celebrate being kin to any European group.  German kids, because of Hitler and the Holocaust, have a tougher time being proud, since if you&rsquo;re honest you can&rsquo;t gloss over that atrocious history.  I think if I had young kids, I&rsquo;d pick the predominant ancestry and teach them pride in that.  Teaching kids to be proud that they&rsquo;re white leads inevitably to hatred, and I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s healthy or necessary.  It also leads to hatred with black kids, but they&rsquo;re going to have to learn that on their own.  I&rsquo;m concerned with getting the best for my own group, and pride in European ancestry seems to me to be the best way to go. </p>

		<p>Hmm, let me get this straight: kids who attend interracial schools do not lose their biases, indeed, they have them strengthened? Hmmm, how could THIS be?? This, despite all the &#8220;scholars&#8221; in the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s who assured us that integration would solve everything? And now these modern-day &#8220;scholars&#8221; tell us not to listen to those old scholars, parents have to begin a program of indoctrination at an early age! But why should we believe these new &#8220;scholars&#8221; when the old ones were so obviously wrong? And why are racial biases so potent and widespread to begin with? Could they just possibly be part of a survival mechanism? But the kicker is the claim that &#8220;It&rsquo;s horrifying to imagine kids being &ldquo;proud to be white.&rdquo; So why is it not horrifying to imagine kids being &ldquo;proud to be black? As far as  the claim that whites don&rsquo;t need this message because they already belong to the &#8220;race that has more power, wealth, and control in society&#8221; the simple answer is that this can change, and if whites have no racial consciousness, they will eventually be kicked out of their own neighborhoods over the short term and kicked out of their own countries over the long term.</p>

		<p>A perfect example of why we need to talk to our children about racial truths before the multi-cultists get to them. Yes, we should talk about race. Often. Black people do. That&rsquo;s why they are so dangerous for Whites to be around. They talk about race constantly, and their fury builds. Our children have no ammunition. They are going out into the world blind and unarmed because no one has ever told them that they belong to the beautiful White race, the creators of Western Civilization. We&rsquo;re special, and our kids need to know it, and not feel guilty about anything they did not do personally. By the way, it ought to be a crime to tell six-year-olds that Santa is Black!  </p>

<p>The white &#8220;graduates&#8221; of the racial re-education classes are more likely to vote for the left-wing&rsquo;s &#8220;equality&#8221; candidates when they get old enough to vote.  Unless they rebel against this nonsense and it appears that a good portion of the sample are already doing so.</p>
<p>Again, the irony of intelligent(?) people spending so much effort on this insanity and it making the cover story of Newsweek shows how much this society has fallen.

		<p>Claremont White Lady is way off. If some child is of German extraction, they have nothing to be ashamed of. They had nothing to do with the Holocaust anymore than someone here at Amren is responsible for or should feel guilty about slavery. White people need to instill pride in their children, make the children feel proud of the positive accomplishments of their own people, of white people in general. Just as the &#8220;minorities&#8221; make their children proud of the (many times supposed) accomplishments of their people, never dwelling on the negative.

		<p>Reading this article really strikes a nerve within me. Being forced into a mixed neighborhood at a very young age, along with other members of my family-by way of the Urban Renewal Project back in the 1960&rsquo;s-my family and i were oppressed by the various negative and destructive elements in that  envirnment. And as a result, i was never able to develop a secure enough base from which to grow on. One reason for this lack of growth of course, was my lack of racial idenity. </p>
<p>I was lucky enough to survive the chaotic and tragic events in my life that followed, and am starting now, in my ripe old middle age, to become more aware of my racial identity. And of course, to take more pride in that identity (I&rsquo;v always said, that one of white people&rsquo;s most powerful weapons, is to walk around with our heads held high.) </p>
<p>But i must confess, after reading and reflecting on this article, and based on my own life&rsquo;s experiences-my heart goes out for the young white children and people of today. </p>

That way they don&rsquo;t have to look inward and feel the need to be accountable to a moral Deity.  Their spiritual poverty is proving suicidal for the white race and if they continue in it they should be separated from society and medicated.</p>

<p>All this study does is waste money and brains. I could have told you the outcome of this study just by observing everyday nature of any species. Why oh why? do these scientist feel they are above the laws of nature is beyond me.</p>

		<p>I believe this study to be an attempt to gain knowledge for the indoctrinators and advocates of the indistinguishable racial differences, ideology.</p>
<p>This was written in the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The point Katz emphasizes is that this period of our children&rsquo;s lives, when we imagine it&rsquo;s most important to not talk about race, is the very developmental period when children&rsquo;s minds are forming their first conclusions about race.</p>
<p>Several studies point to the possibility of developmental windows &mdash; stages when children&rsquo;s attitudes might be most amenable to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those advocating on behalf of the fallacy that all races are exact duplicates of one another are opportunistic. I believe some are in search of ways to rewire the naturally intrinsic response of the human mind regarding racial recognition which, according to the study by Phyllis Katz, begins at 6 months of age.</p>
<p>One merely has to observe this excerpt:</p>
<p>&#8220;developmental windows &mdash; stages when children&rsquo;s attitudes might be most amenable to change&#8221;</p>
<p>A key word in this excerpt is &#8220;amenable.&#8221; Here is the definition of the word from Dictionary. com.</p>
<p>&#8221; 1. ready or willing to answer, act, agree, or yield; open to influence, persuasion, or advice; agreeable; submissive; tractable: an amenable servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words &#8220;submissive&#8221;, &#8220;persuasion&#8221; and &#8220;amenable servant&#8221; garner my attention.</p>
<p>Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman wrote in this article, this:</p>
<p>&#8220;children&rsquo;s brains are noticing skin-color differences and trying to understand their meaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like the writers of the article, the child&rsquo;s brain recognizes, even at that age, there is &#8220;meaning&#8221; behind race. The writers acknowledge there is meaning.</p>
<p>The body movements and physical appearance of human beings and all animals can be indicative of certain increased propensity towards certain behavior, I believe. Certain animals use or possess visual cues to indicate or create the perception they are dangerous e.g. the colors and patterns of a coral snake will alert as to the potential dangers it presents. A scarlet king snake shares similar markings and colors with the coral snake, using this for predator aversion. Appearance is an important factor in the multifaceted equation of life and human survival, it like anything pertaining to biology, contains information.</p>

		<p>Totally one sided &#8220;study&#8221; about how how white children get it all wrong. Horrors, they might even be proud to be white if something isn&rsquo;t done!</p>
<p>What about studying the debilitating effects of being brought up black and taught to hate whites by complaining about slavery (which BTW brought them out of Africa) and &#8220;the legacy of slavery&#8221; and how whites owe blacks?</p>
<p>Ignored is the impact of the fact that blacks as a group are tops on the list of all social pathologies: highest violent crime rate (by far), highest illegitimacy rate, largest academic gap, highest drop out rate, highest discipline rate in school, highest unemployment &amp; poverty, etc.</p>
<p>Whites know more or less about these negative pathologies and though they may have black friends and try to  be fair minded knowing that many blacks are fine people, they understandably don&rsquo;t want to brainwash their own children into thinking that blacks are all essentially whites only with black skin and maybe a few superficial physical characteristics. They instinctively know that blacks are a very different adversarial race that will cheer for their O J Simpson&rsquo;s escape from justice when the victim is white - they&rsquo;ve seen it! But they can&rsquo;t say this.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Her reasoning is that kids are developmentally prone to in-group favoritism; they&rsquo;re going to form these preferences on their own&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This entire study is to justify Marxism:  The belief that human nature can be changed by government &#8216;intervention.&rsquo;  (read that as government force).</p>
<p>Results when this is tried?  Sixty-five million dead as in the old Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Yet despite ALL the evidence to the contrary, every single time these &#8216;experiments&rsquo; are tried, the results are the same.  Even six month old babies:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;will stare significantly longer at photographs of faces that are a different race from their parents, indicating they find the face out of the ordinary&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is hardwired into our DNA as it represents a defensive mechanism to identify out-groups that might be interested in scarce resources.  </p>
<p>Even later when the researchers think the kids &#8216;should know better&rsquo; those racial preferences exist:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Moody found that the more diverse the school, the more the kids self-segregate by race and ethnicity within the school&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why in this day and age is this any kind of news?  Has anyone found, after 40 years of study, a school where the kids don&rsquo;t immediately self-segregate?</p>
<p>And this stupid statement by the &#8216;researchers&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Going to integrated schools gives you just as many chances to learn stereotypes as to unlearn them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the differences between the races aren&rsquo;t stereotypes and even six month old babies know it.  We are not all the same, never will be and I&rsquo;d wish the government would stop funding these studies that produce the exact same results decade after decade.  </p>
<p>Human nature cannot be changed.  The conclusion from the researchers  should be:  Despite our best intentions and tons of government money, we have come to the conclusion that the races naturally do not want to integrate but prefer to self-segregate with their own for reasons that are inexplicable to us .  Despite our best efforts,  despite 40 years of intense study and government-enforced integration, it simply does not work and never will and the results are often violence and ruined lives.</p>
<p>In light of this, our conclusion is that segregation or the races is perhaps after all the best route.</p>
<p>And then this, the REAL REASON for the research:  To denigrated and debase White children into feeling guilty and to make sure they know at an early age that THEY are responsible for all the evil in the world, and should be eliminated.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It&rsquo;s horrifying to imagine kids being &#8216;proud to be white.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Would they DARE make a statement such as:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s horrifying to imagine kids being &#8216;proud to be black&rsquo;  &mdash;  or Jewish or Asian or hispanic?</p>
<p>This is child abuse against White children.  No other ethnic or racial group would stand for it.  We need to boycott publications such as this immediately and let them know why  &mdash;  I discussed this with one of my Newsweek-subscribing relatives last night and she said she would not renew (after 30+ years).  I told her to let them know why.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, these businesses cannot survive without White customers so we must boycott them, one at a time if need be in a concerted, organized effort  &mdash;  otherwise they will continue to abuse, debase and impugn us at will.  This is what all of the other races do, why can&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you BUT I AM SICK OF IT.</p>

<p>The above 2 lines, taken directly from the article, summarize the genocidal agenda of the multiculturalists.  No race on earth can come close to the achievements of Europeans   &mdash;   90% of inventions were conceived by Whites.  Whites have gone to the moon, dissected the atom, cured diseases, explored the bottom of the oceans, created computers and the Internet, and produced amazing civilizations of high culture, health, and standard of living.  </p>
<p>In contrast, there are few races more dismal than Africans.  Other than athletic, musical, and breeding ability, Africans are, by-and-large complete failures.  Although they lived for 10,000 years adjacent to the highly civilized Egyptians, Africans never used/invented the wheel, written language, science, sophisticated metal manufacturing, masonry, or scientific methods.  Today, anywhere Blacks are found, be it in Africa or Hatti, or Detroit,  society and standard of living regress.  The only time Blacks can achieve is when the are educated and trained by Whites and are embedded within a White civilization.  However, once Africans reach about 30 to 40% of the population, that society begins to fail.  </p>
<p>White children have just as much right to be proud as Africans.  In fact, based on facts (i.e., actual accomplishments), Whites and some Asian groups are the only groups that should be proud.  True, the Arabs did make some contributions around 1,000 years ago, but what have they done since then?</p>
<p>It is a twisted and evil world when those who achieve are made to feel inferior, and those who have not and cannot achieve are made to feel superior.   </p>

Regardless of what integration programs they impose, white kids will simply learn what blacks are like by interacting with them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s experience with non-whites that fosters racial awareness. Whites flee their neighborhoods when blacks move in, not because of ignorance, but because they gain first-person experience with non-whites.</p>
<p>Integration doesn&rsquo;t promote tolerance and understanding. It forces whites to see blacks as they are.<br>

<p>The above thinking is a disaster for America.  Our civilization requires constant new scientific and technical breakthroughs to keep from regressing.  These scientific and technological inventions are primarily created by really smart people   &mdash;   the cognitively elite.  Most of the scientific and technological advances are made by the top 3% IQ of our population. Janitors and high school dropouts make no scientific discoveries.  </p>
<p>Creating a productive scientist takes a lot of time, and students do not receive their Ph.D., until ~ age 30.  Then there are 2 to 5 years of Post Doctoral work.  Following that, a scientist only has about 20 years until his/her productivity begins to fall off.  It is a race against time.  To solve our Nation&rsquo;s many problems (agricultural pests, diseases, abundant clean water, energy, transportation, pollution, etc.), we need a constant supply of energetic, motivated, healthy, new, highly intelligent, scientists.  </p>
<p>We must therefore focus on the brightest kids EARLY   &mdash;   even in 1st grade.  We need to identify mentally gifted children and not only give them special advanced education, but instill in them PRIDE and a realization of what they can do, and what our Nation needs them to do.  </p>
<p>Instead of concentrating on the top 3% of gifted children, for the past 50 years we have been throwing all of our resources toward kids at the bottom 50% of IQ, while doing everything to hold back our brightest (those who can actually advance our civilization).  We even take our brightest kids and mix them in with low-IQ, sociopathic ghetto kids, and thus eliminate their ability to learn.  Our future potential Einsteins are cowering in the back of the room, while the teacher presents yet another lecture on the &#8220;great&#8221; civilizations of Africa, the horrors of slavery, and the evil of Europeans.  Our education system is designed to thwart and eliminate the next generation of scientists.  This is insanity!  </p>

		<p>   I had an honest and open discussion with my children when they were old enough to understand &#8220;race&#8221;. Vittrup wouldn&rsquo;t like it at all. I explained to my children that the blacks on television sitcoms are NOT the blacks on the street. I explained to them there are differences between the races. Some are very contrasting. I explained to them that we WILL NOT mix with them under any circumstances. I explained to them that it is NOT right to race-mix. My children are very productive and successful in their fields of endeavor. There are not scarred what-so-ever from my teachings. In one case, my daughter avoided being a victim of blacks due to my teachings. Her friend, whom had not been taught any better, did not. He was beaten by a black boy after school because she had lead him to believe that she was interested in inter-racial dating. When she told him she wasn&rsquo;t, she got a beating for it. Her older brother settled the score, but that&rsquo;s a different story. Had she been taught what to look out for, it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. My children have all been called racists, they just smile and go on about their own business. And yet, they have never lost a friend due to their beliefs. We are not Klansmen, but we are clannish towards our own race. Anybody doesn&rsquo;t like it, too bad.</p>

		<p>&hellip;&#8221;Nationalities of diferent race seem to have an instinct which prevents them from fusing. However much the Jews adapted themselves, in language,manners and to a great extent even in forms of religion, to the European peoples amongst who they lived, the feeling of strangeness between the Jews and their hosts never disappeared. This spontaneous feeling is the ultimate cause of anti-Semitism, which is therefor not to be got rid of by well-meaning propoganda. Nationalities want to pursue their own path, not to blend&#8221;&hellip;. This is an excerpt from The {ADDRESSES ON RECONSTRUCTION IN PALESTINE},IV. from book &#8220;Ideas And Opinions&#8221; by Albert Einsein, Copyright 1954 An excellent book covering many correspondences by a remarkable  man. This is not to say on my part that this is the only correct interpetation of events or correct way for different racial types to co-exist but simply an opinion by a quality dignified man that had reverence for all life including human types.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;article&#8221; on what&rsquo;s &#8220;wrong&#8221; with white babies should raise the red flag in the mind of even some of the most PC brainwashed dullards in the white flock. This is truly one of the most despicable anti-white programs, disguised as a study, that I have ever seen in the US. Is there any doubt that the anti-white gulags are near the forefront of our enemy&rsquo;s minds? If they can&rsquo;t get hold of our children and brainwash them from birth, they&rsquo;ll end up stating that whitey should be locked up, as we&rsquo;re simply dangerous. Innately. At least the white babies and children still have normal, healthy instincts. The Marxists have been successful in burying a lot of those instincts or at least causing confusion and guilt in white children and adults later on, but they can&rsquo;t crack the genes. Yet. </p>
<p>I agree with all who say we need to make our children, white children, proud of our race&rsquo;s leaders and innovators, just like all other groups do with the aid of our anti-white European government. Paul (post #28) is also correct in stating that Einstein should be left out. He actually was more a media creation of the Marxists than the genius he is always portrayed as being in the media. More than enough evidence exists to show that he spent his time at the Patent Office where he worked plagiarizing Poincaire, Lorentz, Fitzgerald and several others. Probably with the help of fellow socialists with long term goals.   As was pointed out by other physicists, when physicists visited Einstein, he would spend his time playing the violin. When musicians visited Einstein, he would talk to them about physics. </p>

If I said that my aforementioned neighbors should feel guilt over the atrocities of Idi Amin or Robert Mugabe or the LA rioters in &#8216;92, they&rsquo;d say I was crazy. How is this not?</p>
<p>Moreover, why on Earth should one be horrified that children of the great white race, responsible for nearly all civilization that has ever existed on this planet (and fully all of modern civilization), and for everything that makes life beyond third-world squalor even possible, be proud of what their forebears achieved and that the same blood runs through their veins? </p>
<p>Newsflash for Newsweek: all this prosperity and affluence of which you write, didn&rsquo;t just fall out of the sky. Our forefathers made this. Our fathers improved on it, and maintained it, and we continue to do so now. It will never be perfect, but it&rsquo;s something to be proud of.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anti-racialism is &#8216;a fixation that borders on mental illness&rsquo;, an &#8216;obsession&rsquo;.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes, whenever race comes up, &#8220;racism&#8221; seems to be the ONLY concern of most whites.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a new retort I want to try on mainstream media posters who make accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think &#8216;racism&rsquo; should be extremely low on your list of concerns that have to do with race. Start giving some thought to these other aspects of race that you&rsquo;ve been trained to not think about: (crimes that weren&rsquo;t committed against whites in earlier years, comparative crime rates now, disruptions of schools, inability to talk about almost ANY problem honestly, discrimination against whites by affirmative action and contract set-asides, etc. etc. etc. etc&hellip;..)&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is the type of article that has made me, a half-breed, really want to extend my apologies to Whites. I am so ashamed of these self-entitled &#8220;coloreds&#8221; and White race-traitors that go to all ends to make your lives living hell. My father is a White man, and I shall love him, no matter how much he betrayed his race and created me, a half-White, half-Oriental countryless mutt. But I can only offer my sympathies to those good hearted Whites that want nothing but for people to leave them alone in their willingness to preserve their heritage. It may be too late for me, but I throw myself behind White Nationalism entirely. But don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t be trying to breed to Oriental out of me anytime soon. I am too supportive of you to do this. </p>

		<p>From my readings in evolutionary psychology, I can only conclude that an extremely developed sense of discrimination and a healthy suspicion of strangers, serves as a survival advantage.  Thus this kind of behavior should be widespread and very adaptive, and no amount of reeducation is going to change millions of years of evolution.  </p>

		<p>  &#8221; the differences between the races aren&rsquo;t stereotypes and even six month old babies know it. We are not all the same, never will be and I&rsquo;d wish the government would stop funding these studies that produce the exact same results decade after decade. &#8220;<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>This is the inevitable result of  building and trying to sustain empires.   It is the cost of empire.  And  diversity is the byproduct of empire.</p>
<p>When a overgrown government finds itself ruling over an assemblage of disparate nations and races, it needs to find ways to make them get along and live together   &mdash;   despite all their natural inclinations to the contrary.   In other words, an empire is an unnatural thing that is imposed upon its subjects and which can only be held together by force.  When the central authority weakens, the empires collapses. </p>
<p>Those commercial and other elements who find the empire to be in their personal interest and  to their own profit are determined to hold it together at any cost   &mdash;   despite its irritation to everyone else.</p>
<p>But this inevitable collapse has been repeated time after time throughout history, as we just saw most recently with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, even little Czechoslovakia and Bosnia.   People prefer their own kind.  Yes, even tiny babies instinctively know what our educated fools, with all their sociology degrees,  don&rsquo;t!</p>

		<p>#48 Yes Celsus.. The prevailing desire is to make a neutral race of humanity. 15 yrs ago the geniuses were telling young 5 yr old boys in school that they (the boys) were wrong to think only girls should wear dresses.. &#8220;boys could wear them too and girls could wear pants.&#8221; Now its ..Whats your problem with men getting married to eachother or black and white or maybe soon as in India a man marrying his doggy. &#8220;Love is all that matters&#8221; and anyone that disagrees is evil and ignorant and hateful and is projecting things he lacks the courage to face ad nauseum. If you notice hyenas,,, You&rsquo;ll see the way they cope as a specie/race in competeing with lions as fellow predators is to become a matriarchy by confusion inter utero of the hormonal chemistry. They cannot confront lions in a direct or masculine way because of their size so they utilize female technique in numbers and their hideous breying and confusion. The females are born larger and more aggressive and have artificial phalluses and dominate the puny prostrating males (a feminist culture of canids boarder line felines) You can see the same with Bonobo chimps where the females dominate the males and consequently where as the full size chimps are larger and patriarchal and act so with dominant males and clan wars&hellip; The bonobo chimp in repressing masculinity.. sublimates this male energy into sexual release in virtually any direction&hellip; pedophile and same gender is perfectly common. THIS is what left leaning progressives are trying to accomplish with us in the western world so that we lose our self recognition and will to defend our White Identity.</p>

		<p>Sent to the Newsweek article authors:</p>
<p>I have read the Newsweek article &#8216;See Baby Discriminate&rsquo; and it raised some interesting points. Since in and out groups are part of human nature, and distinguishing/discriminating between members of said groups would have had obvious survival advantages, it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that young children show preference for their own race. It&rsquo;s a perfectly natural and very sensible instinct, not even now losing it&rsquo;s utility, as different races now share the same space and so an awareness of racial difference in behaviour is extremely useful for planning one&rsquo;s interactions and maximising one&rsquo;s safety and wellbeing.</p>
<p>The was one sentence that stuck out as being odd:&rsquo;It&rsquo;s horrifying to imagine kids being &ldquo;proud to be white.&#8221; &#8216;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I understand this. Why is it horrifying? The achievements of whites are outstanding in every area and far outstrip those of other races. Health, wealth, life expectancy, human rights, technology. You name it, whites do it better. That seems to me to be something immensely proud of and I must say I was surprised when I discovered both the authors were white.  I can&rsquo;t imagine for one moment any black author denouncing being &#8216;proud to be black&rsquo; as &#8216;horrifying&rsquo;, yet the achievements of blacks pale (no pun intended) compared to those of whites. In fact the the &#8216;pride&rsquo; of blacks seems to be as limitless as their achievements are miniscule, so surely it should be black pride you are denouncing as completely misplaced.  I&rsquo;m curious, do you have a problem with &#8216;East Asian&rsquo; or &#8216;Jewish&rsquo; pride, or is it only &#8216;white&rsquo; pride?</p>
<p>Your attitude would be laughable if it wasn&rsquo;t so sad. Here you are getting your messages out via the white invented printing press and Internet, you no doubt own white invented cars and use white invented electricity, take white invented medicines (to which literally millions of non-whites owe their very lives), fly on white invented airplanes, chat to your friends on white invented telephones, eat the food grown with white invented intensive production methods (which allow surpluses to be given to feed the starving non-whites in the third world), dress in clothes made by white invented looms, etc. etc. etc. </p>
<p>Basically you are able to live your lives to their full potential because of white people. Without them not only would you, as whites, not exist, but the rest of the world would be living in the disease and starvation riven, superstitious misery of the stone age.  </p>
<p>Perhaps if white pride is such a problem for you, you could renounce contact with anything white and go back to nature? That would make for an interesting blog for sure (&#8216;my life eating dung in a cave&rsquo;), except that you&rsquo;d have nothing to write it on!</p>
<p>You two are definitely the saddest kind of white folk - happy to have and use everything white, but totally deceitful. Either admit and enjoy your whiteness and it&rsquo;s fabulous fruits or bugger off and stop trying to poison the well for the rest of us. The attempt to encourage your readers to brainwash their children is particularly worthy of contempt. You horrible people. I would call you parasites, but parasitoid would be a better name for you as you are definitely trying to kill your host.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have a sneaky feeling you won&rsquo;t publish this, but your reading it is enough to satisfy me!</p>

		<p>When my son was about three years old, he was looking off the balcony at some boys passing by.  He asked me who were the people with the dark faces.  So, yes obviously they notice racial differences.  And the older they get the more they notice the cutlural differences, too.  He has, and doesn&rsquo;t like it.  Some little girls on our block didn&rsquo;t like playing with the mixed race girl on the block, because her behavior ran true to form, and they would go hide or into one or the other&rsquo;s home to get away from her.  No one told these kids these things, they usually discover it themselves sooner or later.  <br>
When I read this article, I told my son to never let anyone tell him not to feel proud of being white.  And I am half German, so I am very proud of that heritage.  Not every German was a Nazi.  They were and mostly still are a beautiful and proud people and country, and hopefully they can get that back away from all the immigrants coming in to destroy them.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;I have been reading comments about &lsquo;boycutting&rsquo; newsweek and writing letters of protest.  People just don&rsquo;t get it. the more whites protest the more the elites behind this and the liberal white elite who agree with it will jump with joy&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, I can&rsquo;t agree.  Hostile elites know that boycotts work and use them to intimidate the sponsors of programs they don&rsquo;t like.  This tactic almost put Larry Elder out of business in California and now their sights are set on silencing Glenn Beck via sponsor intimidation.</p>
<p>The media  &mdash;  magazines, the alphabet networks, radio  &mdash;  live and die by advertisers.  Air America did not last because no one wanted to listen to their leftist tripe  &mdash;  what advertiser would sponsor such a program if no one is listening?</p>
<p>Boycotts work and they work well. Disgraced lefty Van Jones&rsquo; group ColorofChange is currently conducting a boycott of Glenn Beck&rsquo;s sponsors. DefendGlenn.com is fighting back:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.When the Soros-backed Center for American Progress declared war on DefendGlenn.com a week ago today, we told them that payback is a *****. Three days later we released our Van Jones&rsquo; &#8216;Republicans are a**holes&rsquo; video to YouTube, and the payback began. Van Jones  &mdash;  darling of the Soros crowd and trojan horse for the Socialist takeover of America under the guise of a &#8216;Green Revolution&rsquo;  &mdash;  was finished&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Also from the Defend Glenn website:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;General Mills Pulls Ads from Olbermann&rsquo;s &#8216;Countdown&rsquo;  DefendGlenn exposes MSNBC host&rsquo;s history of sexism and misogyny on his vile program&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/o66hqk</p>
<p>This website has a list of advertisers that have pulled or threatened to pull their ads from Beck, and others that support Beck  &mdash;  with direct links where supporters are encouraged to write directly to the companies to tell them you will either buy or boycott their products.</p>
<p>I have made a point of contacting one advertiser a day  &mdash;  both pro and con Beck. <br>
Yesterday, I wrote to Apple and told them that because of their support of Beck, our family bought two new ApplePro laptop computers and will replace our aging PC with a new Mac.  I will also use  and praise Apple computers at my school site.</p>
<p>Today I will write to Oxi Clean and tell them that because of their support of Glenn Beck, I will buy their products. </p>
<p> Advertisers listen to their customer base because for them money is the bottom line, not politics.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what the white view of integration and &#8220;civil rights&#8221; for blacks has always largely been  &mdash;  colorblindness.</p>

He&rsquo;s a front man, presented to whites, &#8220;conservative&#8221; whites, to make it look as if there really are choices in the mainstream media. There aren&rsquo;t. The little bit of truth he has on his show regarding taxes and healthcare etc does not make up for his horrible backing to the hilt of non-white immigrants, his praising of them for taking work from native born American whites, his repeated chanting of the old canard that the immigrants are doing jobs Americans can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t do. He&rsquo;s either &#8220;on the payroll&#8221; of our enemies in other ways besides his standard paycheck or he is so scared to be called a racist that he is willing to shame himself with hypocritical stances regarding immigration. Both Beck and Van Jones hit the streets and push shopping carts around for the rest of their lives for all I care. </p>

Melodye Rosales, Phyllis Katz, April Harris-Britt do not sound like typical &#8220;majority&#8221; Americans to me.   (Rosales is obviously Hispanic, Katz is Jewish; and I note that Americans rarely hyphenate their last names, while British  and especially West Indians very frequently do).  They are not &#8220;us&#8221; and they do not have our interests at heart. They have an agenda to serve, which is not in our interest. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Bon, Glenn Beck is no friend of the white race. His incredible cheerleading for immigration is disgusting. He&rsquo;s a front man, presented to whites, &#8216;conservative&rsquo; whites, to make it look as if there really are choices in the mainstream media&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for the information.  I admit I am not that familiar with his views on legal immigration (to which I am virulently opposed); his radio program is not available where I live and his show on the FOX network comes on at 2:00 in the afternoon or at night after I am in bed.</p>
<p>However, he is exposing the anti-White racists in the administration for what they are, as no one else in the media will (or is able to).  And I do realize that FOX is NOT a conservative network.</p>
<p>But, it infuriates me when some lefty group decides they are the arbiters of what can and cannot be said or heard and put pressure on or threaten the sponsors of radio hosts they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>I promise I will take another look.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of what the Marxist state atheistic communists used to do. They used to put a plant in a classroom and tell the kids if there is God it will live and then not water it.</p>

		<p>FYI:</p>
<p>TOO (The Occidental Observer) reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The article itself is actually an excerpt from a book titled NurtureShock:  New Thinking About Children, by Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman.  According to their bios, he&rsquo;s a novelist in San Francisco with two children, while she runs a &#8216;church-based tutoring program&rsquo; in Los Angeles&rsquo; inner city&hellip; and is apparently childless&hellip;&#8221;</p>
