<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-policeimmig31-2009aug31,0,1524651.story">500 Groups Urge Obama to Halt Immigration Police Program</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Gorman, Los Angeles Times, August 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A coalition of advocacy groups sent a letter to President Obama last week demanding that the administration end a program that allows local police to enforce federal immigration law.</p>
<p>The program, known as 287(g), deputizes police to turn over suspects or criminals to immigration authorities for possible deportation.</p>
<p>Immigrant rights groups said the program has led to civil rights violations and racial profiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racial profiling and other civil rights abuses by the local law enforcement agencies that have sought out 287(g) powers have compromised public safety, while doing nothing to solve the immigration crisis,&#8221; the letter states. &#8220;The program has worked counter to community policing goals by eroding the trust and cooperation of immigrant communities and diverted already reduced law enforcement resources from their core mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter was sent by the National Immigration Law Center and includes signatures by more than 500 local and national groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In July, the Department of Homeland Security announced an expansion of 287(g) and some changes, including a new agreement that all participating agencies must sign. The agreement requires that police agencies focus their efforts on criminals who pose a threat to public safety, with less emphasis on those who commit minor crimes.</p>

		<p>Not enforcing immigration law will lead to the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans. The proper response to an invasion is to repel it-in this case through the enforcement of immigration law.</p>
<p>Now lets get deeper into the motivation and intent of the signatories of this letter.They clearly understand that post-1965 LEGAL and illegal immigration policy will lead-over time-to the race-replacement of the Native Born White majority. Their intent is to bring about the rapid race-replacement of the Native Born White American majority&hellip;as fast as possible. Native Born White Americans-who also happen to be American citizens and the most to lose-have a legitmate interest in the likely consequences of open borders immigration policy that the signatories of this letter advocate. They demand that Native Born White Americans put their fate in the hands of a massive non-white foriegn voting block. They are demanding that Native Born White Americans commit racial suicide within the borders of America. Native Born White Americans are under no obligation to do this. This is the White Nationalist position on LEGAL and illegal immigration.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Enforcing immigration laws leads to civil-rights violations and racial profiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>By all means, let them all in until all of Mexico is here.</p>
<p>I wonder, though, where they&rsquo;re going to work since the ones here are being laid off before anybody else.  We&rsquo;ve lost 7 million jobs, and we&rsquo;re averaging another 500,000 plus per month.</p>
<p>Amazing how these numbskulls are acting as if the economy is still booming.</p>

		<p>What is particularly striking about this story is that we may very well be heading for the worst economic downturn since the 1930s.  Yet the open-borders crowd could care less.  <br>

<p>Like it or now, admit it or now, any attempt by the U.S. or any organization of said government is going to result in mass violence!! it is just the way mankind is!</p>

		<p>This gang of lawbreakers won&rsquo;t demand Mexico end its immigration enforcement however, nor demand every other nation open its borders. Only the US is supposed to be Uncle Sucker. These socalled civil rights organizations hate the ideal of America as formed in 1776. We must defend the traditional America no matter how many babies these intruders breed.</p>

		<p>Yes, this is what America has come to. Five hundred open borders groups, no matter how few people some of them have as members, are more important than millions of Americans opinions on the border.</p>

		<p>National Security and economic preservation trump civil rights of protecting illegal immigrants.  US has no way of knowing if illegals are here to commit harm but we do know these people came here against US laws and care not to keep them.  V</p>

		<p>Washington is deliberately closing down immigration from Europe, especially Eastern Europe. Every citizen of Eastern Europe remembers, or has relatives who remember, life under communist rule. The congress doesn&rsquo;t want them here because they know these people will instantly recognize the communist ideology pervading American government, Hollywood and the mainstream media. Washington is afraid they will sound the alarm&hellip;..<br>
