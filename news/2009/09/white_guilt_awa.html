<h1>White Guilt Awareness Day</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Caroline Rushing, Human Events, Sept. 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you are straight, white, and male, please stand up. Congratulations, you are more privileged than you probably ever realized. Because of your blessed birth, you are responsible for the victimization of thousands of your underprivileged peers. You may not be aware, but implicitly you hate, resent, and distrust everyone who does not look like you. How does this make you feel? No, do not answer. Instead, allow us to tell you how you should be feeling. You should be feeling extremely guilty and ashamed, and in order to move past your racist tendencies and make amends for being born privileged, you should apologize to those you victimize daily. Now, tell us how you feel.</p>
<p>The above sums up the way the Left deals with diversity. I have witnessed this firsthand during &#8220;diversity day&#8221; for a leadership conference just this past summer at the University of Virginia, where I am a rising third-year student. This kind of indoctrination from the Left is not unique to my school.</p>
<p>Allow me to walk you through the day I call &#8220;white guilt awareness day.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>During breakfast, we took a &#8220;privilege assessment&#8221; to gauge how much more advantaged white people are than everyone else. The measure of privilege was split up into three categories: Gender and Sexual Orientation, Race, and Nationality. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Next, we moved to a lecture discussing an article titled &#8220;The Central Frame of Color-Blind Racism.&#8221; In his remarks, the professor essentially told the class that implicit feelings of resentment and hatred are engrained in all white people. Now, not only did the white students feel guilty, but also the minority students felt victimized and resentful. </p>
<p>The last infuriating activity was a personal reflection activity. We were given web-charts with eight stems in the web. Each stem was to be filled with the following categories: race, gender, sexual preference, socio-economic status, religion, disability, and two characteristics of our choice. We then were asked to discuss, in small groups, a time we were proud and a time we were ashamed to identify with one of these characteristics. A &#8220;privileged&#8221; man in my group fed right into the liberal agenda of the activity and explained he has been ashamed of being a white man when he sees the terrible things that white men have done, the injustices in the world, and how he has so much while others have so little. This poor guy took the diversity day bait hook, line, and sinker. </p>
<p>&#8220;White guilt&#8221; is the politically correct agenda taught by the Left on college campuses today. That is why colleges such as Bryn Mawr and Mt. Holyoke have started student organizations called &#8220;Whiteness Awareness Allies Group,&#8221; and &#8220;Mt. Holyoke Anti-Racism Coalition.&#8221; These groups were formed so that white students can sit around and &#8220;facilitate dialogue about whiteness,&#8221; &#8220;deconstruct white privilege,&#8221; feel guilty about being white, and find ways to apologize to society for the injustices whites have inflicted upon other cultures. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Welcome to the politically correct world of higher education  &mdash;  allow them to tell you how you should feel.<br>

		<p>I once tested this theory out.  I went to a BMW dealership in the well-to-do part of St. Louis.  I asked the dealer to give me their most expensive flagship BMW sedan, at the time, it was the 750iL with bullet proof glass, because I had white male privilege.  The dealer, another &#8220;privileged&#8221; white male, told me to beat it before he called more &#8220;privileged&#8221; white males with guns and badges to make me beat it.</p>
<p>Ipso fact, no white privilege.</p>

		<p> Viruses are subtle and this masochistic infection throughout the modern world is good proof. I&rsquo;ll explain, it is a virtue to admit your faults and to compensate as much as possible for them, I think with this most will agree. It may also be considered a virtue to acknowledge what your specific culture did wrong, but here the situation becomes a little slippery. What I&rsquo;m trying to say in as few words as possible is, in supposed repentence have you reaped the rewards of contriteness or&hellip; sato-masocistic pleasure/pain,&hellip;getting off on putting your ancestors down&hellip; perhaps to avoid true guilt feelings you lack  the audacity to deal with? Perhaps like.. not carrying the torch you received from your ancestors with the tenacity and diligence they did,&hellip; or other forms of decadence in your life that you prefer to divert your attention from? I&rsquo;ve noticed a great deal of so called bleeding heart types are trying to appease their guilt in other hidden aspects of their life with these outward forms of emotional diarhea.</p>

		<p>I believe that around 95 percent of colleges should be shut down.  The only non science or engineering fields of study should be the study of European and American history.  No more social sciences or black studies nonsense, no more women&rsquo;s studies or transgendered garbage.  No more forced leftist indoctrination facilitated by taxpayer money.  Scientists and engineers, that is who this country needs, not leftist goons.</p>

		<p><i> Now, not only did the white students feel guilty, but also the minority students felt victimized and resentful.</i></p>
<p>Yes, and that &#8220;resentment,&#8221; turned to seething hatred, can be detected quite easily by any white person foolish enough to set foot (or to have a car breakdown) in any &#8220;inner city&#8221; area.</p>
<p>This so-called &#8220;white privilege&#8221; has made entire tracts of once-great cities into no-man&rsquo;s-lands for whites. Whites now have the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of having entire neighborhoods off-limits to them. Whites have the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of having to drive greater and greater distances to work. Whites now have the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of skyrocketing home and insurance costs.  Whites now have the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of seeing their property values plummet if blacks, fleeing their own crime infested neighborhoods, decide to move in. And on top of it all, whites are told that they must feel guilty for this state of affairs. Such &#8220;privilege&#8221; conferred upon whites leaves most whites helpless indeed.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You should be feeling extremely guilty and ashamed, and in order to move past your racist tendencies and make amends for being born privileged, you should apologize to those you victimize daily. Now, tell us how you feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.) I feel disgusted at being part of a race that has produced a cultist &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; majority, that sermonizes squirming sadomasochism into sanctified beatitudes;</p>
<p>2.) I feel that racial guilt and shame are the products of hopelessly warped and wretchedly enfeebled minds;</p>
<p>3.)  I feel that whites apologizing to other races for past or present &ldquo;victimizations,&rdquo; is nothing but a ghastly exercise in race treason;</p>
<p>4 And I feel that the abjectly asinine &ldquo;concept&rdquo; of &ldquo;white privileged&rdquo; should be criminalized, with all who advocate it that are nonwhite being expelled from the USA, and all white traitors who do likewise being subject to between similar or even outright execution.</p>
<p>Well, that is how I feel about that! </p>
<p>Any questions? <br>

		<p>&ldquo;[implicit] feelings of resentment and hatred are engrained in all white people.&rdquo;  This is the exact opposite of reality; only the feelings are not just implicit.  </p>
<p>I ask you:  Which race resents and hates the other race?</p>
<p>Of course it is the minorities that resent the beauty, intelligence, and success of the white race and hate its members.  </p>
<p>I think this whole privilege hoax is a scam run by atheists.  Are not good looks and intelligence God given attributes that no one has done anything to earn?  Good looks and intelligence are a privilege just like being white.  </p>
<p>Should beautiful women and handsome men disfigure themselves?  Should intelligent people do dumb things to harm themselves so as to not take advantage of their privilege gift?  Many blacks are tall and can jump high.  They take advantage of their tallness and jumping privilege.  </p>
<p>Whiteness, beauty and intelligence, two attributes highly correlated with whiteness, are gifts.  People should not throw away their gifts of whiteness, beauty and intelligence and the connected privilege.  They should use their privilege for good.  </p>
<p>Many of these anti-white provocateurs are themselves white.  They are using their gift of white privilege to do evil to other white people.   <br>

		<p>We need to provide whites with some self-defence knowledge. What&rsquo;s needed is a booklet or paperback size refutation of these white guilt programs that target students and employees. A Q &amp; A format might be best. I&rsquo;d recommend that it be somewhat mild and politically correct since we don&rsquo;t want whites to get into trouble with their institutions. For example avoid explanations based on racial differences since that is a taboo topic. Or maybe have the book in two parts, the first part is a more politically correct defence of whites, and the second part gives the straight talk.</p>

		<p>Leftists are convinced that white men mistreat non-whites, women, homosexuals, Jews, and have always done so.  So what is their explanation for why these same parties can&rsquo;t seem to get enough of white men?  Why do they flock to us, instead of fleeing us?</p>
<p>More to the point, doesn&rsquo;t leftists&rsquo; own logic define as malfeasance the leftist insistence on diversity and massive immigration of non-whites into white living spaces?  If white men are evil, isn&rsquo;t forcing these parties into close proximity with us even worse than the evil white men do?</p>

		<p>I went through the routine described by Ms. Rushing as a parent of an incoming student at the freshman student/parent orientation weekend at UNC-Charlotte in the summer of 2008. I think that we can all safely assume that the entire UNC University system operates on similar templates.</p>
<p>After a whole day of tedious and chaotic lectures, frenetic whirlwind marches and bus rides to various campus buidings and &#8220;break out sessions&#8221; punctuated by &#8220;urban diversity&#8221; themed choreographed chant and dance routines performed by rising sophomore minority students &#8220;earning their way through college&#8221; on topics that ranged from gender bender student groups to rap explanations about the functions of the &#8220;UNC-CHLT Office of &#8216;at risk of academic failure&rsquo; Black Male Assistance Office of Equal Opportunity, we were all finally allowed to go to an on campus cafeteria for dinner. But alas, I couldn&rsquo;t even get half way through my fried chicken and mashed potatoes dinner when another &#8220;song and dance troupe&#8221; of minority students &#8220;earning their way through college&#8221; made a rowdy door busting entry into the cafeteria and proceeded to perform a table top boom shaka-laka dah big bad booty thang rap/dance routine. I about choked on mah chiken.</p>

		<p>A simple lesson in capitalism from Ayn Rand that university elites should learn is that the producer does not produce at the expense of the non-producer. I understand that this is difficult considering that university elites have lived their entire lives without ever leaving school and have worked most of their adult lives on what every business in the world would consider a part time basis. How any adult who has worked part time for decades can look the son or daughter of a workaholic(s) in the eye and claim that he or she and his or her workaholic parents are somehow privileged is rediculous. If it weren&rsquo;t bad enough that today&rsquo;s modern university education costs as much as a new house, today&rsquo;s modern university graduate will have to learn how to produce in spite of a university education. After all, how could a lifelong part time worker possibly teach anyone about drive, determination and long term intestinal fortitude? Especially when elites despise these chracteristics if the person having them happens to be white or have any morality in the classic sense. I personally view university professors as people who have had both time and money most of their adult lives. I consider that the very definition of privilege considering I&rsquo;ve had very little of both at the same time in my life.    </p>

		<p>When living in SF a few years back, a friend and I went to a tiny fish and chips shop, run by Koreans oddly enough. My friend and I stood at the counter and ordered the EXACT same thing, even down to the choice of drink.  However, when it came time to pay, I paid first but noticed his was noticeably less than my total due. I started to ask him what was going on and he said he&rsquo;d tell me later.</p>
<p>Totally confused, I took my food and walked out of the shop. As we walked down the street he informed me of the &#8220;Korean discount&#8221;. He is Korean-American and they simply gave him a deal on his dinner whereas me, the white American, got no deal. I asked him if he knew them (perhaps he&rsquo;s eaten there regularly?), but he said no. I asked him how they knew he was Korean-American (truthfully, they looked Asian to me.  Period.) and he said they just did. </p>
<p>I was very upset at this discovery   &mdash;   how did I never know about this kind of stuff? Not only that, but I don&rsquo;t recall getting the Caucasian-American discount where we whites would knowingly look at each other and nod and then give each other discounts(!).  Maybe we should start doing this? </p>

I also met my first full blooded Indian when I was over thirty. &#8220;History is a nightmare from which we can&rsquo;t wake up&#8221; said James Joyce. It can&rsquo;t be changed. I see no reason to dwell on it  &mdash;  all peoples have committed atrocities. Whites as a group have done more than any race to rectify past misbehavior. </p>

		<p>We need to sart the Priveledged White Male Professors Guilt Association. With the sole goal of having white male college professionals and staff surrender their jobs.<br>
This association would have professors quit their cushy teaching jobs and swear to never work in education again. They could only be replaced with minority professors. Then the white professrs can take jobs in the real world.Then they can live out their Affirmative Action Creed instead of having other white males being forced to give up their opportunities. I wonder how many takers we&#8221;ll have.</p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not a white male but I am a white female, so I guess that makes me somewhat privileged in this politically correct world.  So after reading this article, I really thought about how privileged I was.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see I grew up in Baltimore City in a regular row house with 3 bedrooms and ONE bathroom, with my parents and 5 siblings.  Sometimes, we had our electric turned off because my parents couldn&rsquo;t pay the bill and sometimes, we ate french toast twice a day because all my mom had was milk and bread and we were lucky to have that.  I got hand me down clothes from my older sister and only got new school shoes once a year because my grandmother bought them for me.</p>
<p>I was privileged enough to at least later on get a brand new bike for Christmas and Barbie dolls when my Dad started bookmaking and I don&rsquo;t mean the kind you read.  </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get my first car until I was 19 and it was a 1964 Nash Rambler but I was privileged because at least when I put gas in it, it did get me to college everyday.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m even more privileged today because I have a decent job with a law firm and OMG, I have a brand new car this time that I have to make a monthly payment on for the next 4 years and by then I might be privileged enough that it will still be running.</p>
<p>And thanks to my privileged whiteness, I was able to buy a house 17 years ago for $22,000.00 and even better it&rsquo;s almost paid for.</p>
<p>So after all of that - gosh I should feel really guilty for oppressing all of those minorities so that I could live such a privileged life all these years.</p>

		<p>Younger people today are far less racist than any previous generation and the people who promote &#8220;diversity&#8221; know this.  It scares them.  That is why there has been a shift from combating overt racism in our society to this concept of indirect racism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for the movement to show gullible and insecure white people that they are racist without knowing it.  Since there is so little actual racism in mainstream society, they must trick people into thinking they are racist or this movement will die.</p>
<p>I am hoping most people will realize what is happening and stop buying into the blame game.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think this whole privilege hoax is a scam run by atheists.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think you are completely mistaken.  As an atheist myself - an intellectual one, not a reactive one - I support the idea of race seperation and race realism.  That is because race realism is another type of realism just as general realism and deep study has informed me that religion is not only causitive of the plight of our race, but Christianity in particular.  That is why I constantly point out how Christianity does this in my posts, at least whenever possible.  I also realize that most people require some sort of belief system for a culture to form around, so I encourage a reform of pre-Christian European spirituality and belief systems that support our racial identity and our right to our original tribal lands - at the least.</p>
<p>But if you really think that the white privilege hoax is run my atheists, why don&rsquo;t you document your reasons for this idea?</p>
<p>If you just casually study this issue, you will find Christianity and other religions behind most of it.  In particular, Catholicism and Lutheranism, with others like the Unitarians, the Episcopal Church, etc.  I would admit that some PC liberals are atheists, but this is more of a coincidence than an organizing principal.  Even the Baptist Church has been importing non-whites into the U.S. as converts under assylum laws for decades. Most of the government agencies that serve the non-white drive are peopled by non-white Christian personnel.  </p>
<p>In fact, it is difficult for an atheist to survive in any government position, let alone get elected to a public office.  In the military, for example, it is nearly impossible to escape the pressure to be a Christian.  IN one famous hushed up case, Pat Tilman, a national celebrity football player who volunteered for Special Forces specifically because of 9/11, was murdered by his own men because he was an atheist who used to confound them in discussions about religion.  His parents found that out and publicized it until they suddenly disappeared from the public scene.</p>
<p>And yet you think atheists have all this power in the U.S.?  </p>
<p>I think people like you are chronically upset because the U.S. is not a Christian theocracy, and your idea of America is that it ought to be a Christian theocracy.  Your nation would be extremely tiny, especially since this sort of tendancy has been historically proven to divide people sect by sect until it is basically comparable to tribal warfare.  </p>
<p>If you believe your NT, Jesus predicted it;  Mark 13:12 - &#8220;Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.&#8221; The fighting between Christians themselves is what the first three centuries of Christian history show us.  After that, it was one dominating church that purged European whites for a thousand years, until white Europeans - the most intelligent ones, finally prevailed.  Would you take us back to that?  I don&rsquo;t see much future for the white race in that mindset.  Are we to be sheep, led by such capricious, power mad leaders?  What is more important here, the survival of the white race or a particular religious system that is not even of European origin?</p>

		<p>Instead, allow us to tell you how you should be feeling. You should be feeling extremely guilty and ashamed, and in order to move past your racist tendencies and make amends for being born privileged, you should apologize to those you victimize daily. Now, tell us how you feel.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it fascinating how the supposedly most privileged people of the world, are the worlds smallest minority? Isn&rsquo;t also fascinating how these privileged people are the only ones being told they must welcome other races into their ancestral homeland of Europe, and are shamed for and scorned for feeling any ethic pride, while their less privileged counterparts are encouraged to be vocally prideful in their ethnic identity, and also supported in their desire to keep their homelands homogeneous? And how these privileged people are kept out of jobs they are more qualified for than others, because oh yes, they are the privileged people. Now, if someone will just tell me, exactly how are we privileged? Maybe, I can start feeling guilty as I am supposed to. </p>

		<p>What is considered &ldquo;white&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Down here we have Irish Celebrations, Greek celebrations, Italian celebrations, Scottish, etc. Recognizing the achievements and success of these groups to the exclusions of all others. Just like black celebrations, native american celebrations, etc. </p>
<p>Well, for starters, the Irish, Greeks, Italians, and Scottish obviously are all white, although some afrocentric minded blacks often try and insist some of them aren&rsquo;t. But it&rsquo;s always made me laugh how blacks consider anyone of African descent to be black, but try and compartmentalize Europeans as though they are seperate races. I have even heard them say, they don&rsquo;t mind it when whites speak of Irish pride, or Italian pride, but become extremely offended when they claim white pride. Which probably has more to do with them wanting division among whites. Pretty hypocritical when you think about it, since they like to include non-blacks or anyone who is non-white among them in their people of color umbrella.</p>

		<p>This white guilt agenda only existed after the cold war, and especially following the 60&rsquo;s, when Marxist radical types began to take hold in the West. Can you just picture these tactics working on our Grandparents? It&rsquo;s no wonder Americans from the 40&rsquo;s are often referred to as the greatest generation. In so many ways, they were stronger, more solid, with backbone, and unshakable pride. In those days, nobody would allow anyone to guilt trip them about being white</p>

		<p>the biggest problem we have in this country, is that we continue to harp about the legacy of slavery, an instutution that was ended 144 years ago, and was ended by 600 thousand white boys dying to end it. an institution where not even 1/8th of one percent of the american population at the time were slave owners. and here we are 144 years later letting it consume us, and allowing our universities and its liberal professors to try to criminalize our very being, trying desperately to fill our youth with guilt. and at the end of the day, they leave their cushy job and drive home in their BMWs to their all-white gated communities. how pitiful and how pathetic has out country became? </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that the same people who preach White guilt/privilege to the masses are the same ones who deny that there are any genetic differences among races. They claim it&rsquo;s &#8220;environmental only,&#8221; and when they&rsquo;re presented with evidence that whites are more intelligent, commit less crime, and have higher standards of living, they pull the &#8220;unprivileged,&#8221; &#8220;racist,&#8221; and &#8220;poor&#8221; cards. </p>
<p>But of course it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword (just like all of liberalism), but they&rsquo;ll never admit it. If there&rsquo;s no difference genetically between Whites and any other race, then I guess I can head to someplace near the Equator for 3 or 4 weeks of intense tanning and &#8220;become&#8221; black? After all, it&rsquo;s all environmental. Then after I&rsquo;m black, I&rsquo;ll somehow lose all of my inherent White privileges, and I can apply for all the Affirmation Action/welfare advantages that Whites do not receive. Then everything is more &#8220;equal,&#8221; right?</p>
<p>I wonder what excuse the liberal egalitarians that run our universities would throw at that.</p>

<p>Yes, I have noticed that too.  It&rsquo;s the old divide and rule technique. Ultimately, they would claim that everyone who isn&rsquo;t blonde and blue-eyed isn&rsquo;t  really and truly  &#8220;white&#8221;.   </p>

		<p>I once knew a black woman (where I worked) whose daughter had been given a scholarship by Hadassah and went off to college and got radicalized.  Everything this woman said or believed about race was parrotted straight from her radical daughter   &mdash;   which was in in turn parrotted straight from out of a Black Studies class. The woman was not hostile or radical herself, but she sounded just like Prof. Ignatief when she started on race.</p>
<p>She insisted that there were really only two kinds of people in this world:  white and black.  If you weren&rsquo;t &#8220;white&#8221;, then you were &#8220;black&#8221;. Very simple!   I asked her what about the Chinese, for instance. The answer was easy    &mdash;   they are black!  Mexicans? They are black too!</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest she try telling that to any Chinese person. Nor any Mexican!</p>
<p>Obviously, she was equating &#8220;black&#8221; with color. Any color would do.  All the same thing to her.  It was the Rainbow Coalition against whites. The objective that&rsquo;s clearly going on there is to isolate whites into a corner, making us into a tiny and insignificant fraction of humanity.  A sort of bizarre mutation. A mistake of Mother Nature.  And, yes, as we&rsquo;ve all been told (by Susan Sontag and such), &#8220;the cancer of history&#8221;.   (But we already knew that!)</p>
