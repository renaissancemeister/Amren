<h1>Commission Penalizes Swim Club in Pennsylvania Racism Complaint </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A state commission issued a finding of probable cause that racism was involved in the decision by a suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, swim club to revoke privileges of a largely minority day care center.</p>
<p>The Valley Swim Club canceled a contract for swimming privileges for the approximately 65 children from the Creative Steps day care center after a visit June 29.</p>
<p>Some black and Hispanic children said white club members made racist comments to them during that visit, asking why black children were there and raising concerns that &#8220;they might steal from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, in its 33-page finding, details the incident. It notes that the swim club maintains that it canceled its relationship with the day care center because members were requesting that their membership fees be refunded and because of safety concerns &#8220;attendant with overcrowding of the shallow end of the pool by a large number of non-swimmers.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the group was swimming at the club, one of its members voiced concerns that &#8220;all of these black kids&#8221; might &#8220;do something to my child.&#8221; When confronted by a Creative Steps official, the woman  &mdash;  a teacher at a local school  &mdash;  denied the comment but said she was concerned because one of the children &#8220;was a known thief&#8221; and had previously stolen a cell phone. The commission found no evidence that the child was ever accused of or disciplined for stealing at the school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Depending on the outcome of that process, the club could face damages for humiliation and embarrassment, as well as a civil penalty of up to $50,000, commission spokeswoman Shannon Powers said. The public hearing, she said, is held before a body of commissioners.</p>
<p>The commission enforces state human rights law, Powers said. It launched an investigation into the incident after being contacted by a number of advocacy organizations following media coverage of the story. Since then, she said, a number of complaints have been filed with the commission.</p>
<p>The commission noted in the finding that none of the club&rsquo;s 155 paid members this year was African-American and that last year there were &#8220;179 paid memberships, none of whom were African American.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the commission said that in 2009, the Valley Swim Club &#8220;made a concerted effort to expand the geographic range of its membership by engaging in a marketing campaign&hellip; .   The respondent efforts were mainly directed at areas with overwhelmingly caucasian populations&hellip; .   The respondent made no effort to direct such marketing efforts at areas with significant African-American populations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glassman said the swim club had 30 days to appeal the finding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The day care center had originally contracted to use the pool during the summer, but the club canceled the agreement and returned the day care center&rsquo;s $1,950 check without explanation. The club canceled contracts with two other day care centers because of safety and crowding, swim club director John Duesler said.</p>
<p>Those facilities have not protested the club&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>The issue was exacerbated when Duesler told two Philadelphia television stations that the children had changed &#8220;the complexion&#8221; and &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; of the club. The comment brought protesters outside the facility.</p>

		<p>The commission noted in the finding that none of the club&rsquo;s 155 paid members this year was African-American and that last year there were &ldquo;179 paid memberships, none of whom were African American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did they also note the numerous black organizations and clubs that hire only blacks and have only black memebers.  Did the commission note that when a white liberal tried to join the black caucus, he was denied, or when a white reporter tried to attend a NAACP rally he was denied while black reporters where admitted? </p>
<p>With all the black organizations, the hypocrisy is glaring.  This is just harrassment of a private white club.</p>

		<p>Of course the PA HRC found that the swim club was at fault, because the swim club leaders rolled over and cried uncle so quickly.  All the HRC had to do was the read the swim club leaders&rsquo; own words.  Had they not showed fear in front of the dog, the dog would not be biting them right now.</p>

		<p>What is it with blacks and browns that they need to FORCE THEMSELVES on other people when they&rsquo;re not wanted?  Is this what they think will promote racial harmony?  In fact, it causes many of us to hate them.  It&rsquo;s like liver.  You know you&rsquo;re not gonna like it even before you ever try it, but when mom forces you to eat it, you end up despising the liver and &#8220;almost&#8221; despising mom for doing it to you.<br>

		<p>So, it appears that white people no longer enjoy the right of free association anymore. Correct me if I am wrong, but wasn&rsquo;t this a &#8220;private&#8221; club? And so what if some of the members may have made &#8220;racial&#8221; remarks? Those members are speaking as individuals-they do not represent the owners of the club. What is next: If you have a backyard swimming pool, you must invite a selected number of &#8220;African Americans&#8221; and not just white people? Someone once said that this country was headed towards a Communist system. At the time, I thought they were exagerating. Now, I am not so sure.</p>

		<p>  It is time for the &#8220;rights commissions&#8221; to investigate and charge clubs that cater to Blacks, Hispanics,Arabs, Jews,Indians and all other groups for failing to have enough white members or in the case of Black clubs,businesses and institutions not enough white, Indian, Arab, Jewish etc. and the same for all the others.<br>
  I am personally excluded from one each= Indian, Black and a Jewish business club because I am not Black-Jewish-Indian and these clubs have business opportunities only open to their respective groups.<br>
That was the door to force white country clubs to accept all people as members so it should equally apply to all the other groups.<br>
   The law should apply to all and if it does ot then the government should be held accountable.</p>

		<p>So I guess a private organization cannot advertise or cater to a certain demographic without fear of being demonized as being somehow racist. I would imagine if a black family had the money to be a member of this club their money would more than likely not have been refused. From what I have read these kids were refused entry due to the size of the group and the fact that most of the kids could not swim and therefore crowded the shallow end of the pool. It is also not up to the ownership of the pool to police what is being said by paying members. I cant help but wonder if companies that cater to blacks would be subject to such sanctions.</p>

		<p>Will this &#8221; commission &#8221; punish the federal &#8221; Black Congressional Caucus &#8221; for their bigotry and exclusivity against Whites and all other non-blacks ? The B.C.C. is not private like the swim club  but is funded disproprtionately by Whites through taxes which is public. What racial double standards against Whites as usual since 1954 A.D. .</p>

<p>How dare they call such laws &#8220;human rights&#8221;.  What about the human right to be left alone and to enjoy the company of your own kind?  What about the human right called &#8220;freedom of association&#8221;?  Obviously, in the eyes of leftists, whites are not &#8220;human&#8221; and, therefore, not worthy of &#8220;human rights&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Notice how every time &#8220;Blacks&#8221; make specious discrimination charges against White entities they always tack on &#8220;and Hispanics&#8221; to the charge? This gives the impression that those Hispanics who are supportive of them are something other than Hispanic &#8220;Blacks&#8221; </p>
<p>For too long, &#8220;Blacks&#8221; have clung to the shirt tails of the White community, while at the same time spitting in their face. </p>
<p>Now that the White community is dwindling in proportion to &#8220;others&#8221;, it seems &#8220;Blacks&#8221; are desperately trying to find another victim group to hang onto. Its unlikely to work with the non-&#8220;Black&#8221; Hispanic community. &#8220;Blacks&#8221;  are likely to find they are not as tolerant and long suffering as were the Whites.</p>

		<p>The club did this to themselves when they caved in.  Everyone here KNEW this would happen.  They placated, and then got slapped.  If they had been honest in the first place they would likely still face the same sanction BUT with their heads held high and proud.  The club&rsquo;s failure only helps make White Americans look MORE helpless.  At some point a private club has to grow a pair.<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it an amazing fact of history that blacks and browns can&rsquo;t establish anything worthwhile on their on, they have to constantly &#8220;force&#8221; themselves into white society.  Does that stand as a valid fact or not?  </p>
<p>Why do whites give up their societies to those of color? when they are clearly not qualified for equal participation.  It&rsquo;s all a give and give more equation to the inferior.</p>
<p>Of course when whites run out of things to give then and only then will we cease to exist.  </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the use of being private if you can&rsquo;t control the membership roles?</p>
<p>And the last time I checked, racism isn&rsquo;t illegal (I like how they used the term &#8220;probable cause,&#8221; a criminal law evidentiary standard). </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m stunned that the blacks and browns don&rsquo;t have a nice modern facility already - paid for by white taxpayers. After all, that&rsquo;s how it is here in L.A.. When I was growing up in the 70&rsquo;s we had to endure some crummy facilities because the funds just weren&rsquo;t there. Yet, now that the areas in which I lived are all hispanic or black, the public pools and playgrounds have facilities that are first class. At least for a while. The browns and blacks generally trash them quickly, then after a bit the pools and parks are repaired and cleaned up top notch. All paid for by you-know-who. And then the never-greatful browns and blacks destroy the facilities again - and then blame the disrepair and the fact that the facilities aren&rsquo;t repaired instantly, aren&rsquo;t repaired the second they&rsquo;re trashed, on white racism. The city is broke but the money keeps pouring in to pander. Middle class whites had to rely on basically second rate facilities when I was growing up and they didn&rsquo;t care, didn&rsquo;t expect more. Not so for the always spoiled, always greedy, too dumb to understand where the money comes from denizens of the ghettos and barrios. Ghettos and barrios they themselves create because of their innate behaviors.  When whites build their own facilities, private facilities with their own money, the invaders sooner or later show up. We should be asking who directs them to do this, as it&rsquo;s obvious someone is leading them by the nose. </p>
