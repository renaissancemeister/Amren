<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8259319.stm">Execution Date Set for US Sniper</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, Sept. 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A US judge in Virginia has set a 10 November execution date for the man behind the 2002 sniper attacks on the Washington DC area. </p>
<p>John Allen Muhammad was sentenced to death for the murder of Dean Meyers, one of 10 people killed during the shootings. </p>
<p>Muhammad&rsquo;s teenage accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo is serving life in prison for his part in the attacks. </p>
<p>Muhammad&rsquo;s lawyer said his client would appeal to the US Supreme Court. </p>
<p>The lawyer, Jonathan Sheldon, also said he would ask Virginia Governor Timothy Kaine for clemency. </p>
<p>Muhammad and Malvo killed six people in Alabama and Louisiana before moving on to Maryland, Washington and Virginia. </p>
<p>Mr Meyers was shot at a petrol station in Manassas, Virginia. </p>
<p>In August a federal appeals court rejected Muhammad&rsquo;s argument that prosecutors withheld critical evidence and that he never should have been allowed to act as his own attorney for a portion of his trial because he was too mentally impaired. </p>
<p>The attorney general&rsquo;s office had requested last week that the execution be on Monday 9 November. </p>
<p>But Prince William County Circuit judge Mary Grace O&rsquo;Brien chose Tuesday, so the courts would be open the day before for any last-minute appeals. <br>

		<p>This criminal was not a sniper. Sniping is long-range execution which requires fieldcraft and marksmanship, amont other things. This criminal shot people from very close range. It would be more appropriate to call him a gunman.</p>

		<p>I clearly remember this. All the &#8220;experts&#8221;, &#8220;profilers&#8221; and talking heads (especially on CNN) said the shooter(s) were White males. When they turned out to be blacks, the whole issue was dropped.</p>

		<p>Not that I don&rsquo;t agree, but the Attorney General of Virginia, Bob McConnell, who wants Mr. Mohammed to meet his 72 virgins on November 10, is running for Governor.  Election day is close to November 10.</p>

		<p>John Allen Muhammad received taxpayer-funded military marksmanship training. I wonder how the Muslim press will report this? Will John Allen Muhammad be portrayed as a martyr?</p>

		<p>Note that this non-white multiple murderer is labelled a &#8220;sniper.&#8221;  A white person who does this is invariably a &#8220;serial killer.&#8221;</p>

It would be more appropriate to just call him the murderer he is, he is NOT A SNIPER, only a murderer.</p>

		<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m being too general but, it seems to me the convicted murderer, Muhammad, is simply just that - a murderer. He is another African American killer, among the extremely disproportionate numbers of fellow African American murderers. His modus operandi might have differed from others but, the results were the same. I do not see him as being special. I&rsquo;m afraid the media might make him feel that way. </p>
<p>I believe if you murder, you have revoked your right to live. So I believe justice has been rendered.    </p>

		<p>i agree with several points made by earlier posters about how this black muslim serial murderer is portrayed by the media.<br>
1. a &#8221;sniper&#8221; is a military term used in a positive sense for an expertly trained marksman used to take out the enemy at great distances with a single shot, as the navy seals who took out the somalian pirates who held the american tanker captain hostage several months ago. at 300 plus yards 3 seal marksmen took out 3 of the 4 pirates with a single shot each to the head. given the situation, they were heros. the pacifist obama had to be practically forced kicking and screaming to give the o.k. for this, by the way.<br>
2. i remember the media saying to be on the lookout for 2 men, probably white, in a white van. they were who they focused their search for. after they were found to be black, they had to do something to soften the revelation that the murderers were black, so someone found officer moose, a black police chief - who wasn&rsquo;t really directly responsible for their capture - to be the official spokesperson&hellip;.as if an intelligent black was responsible for cracking the case. they did this sort of thing with the outrageous riots, looting, and &#8221;sniping&#8221; at coast guard helicopters in new orleans by black thugs on building tops in the wake of hurricane katrina in new orleans. many nurses and doctors were also shot at as they tried to evacuate patients - most of them black - from hospitals in downtown n.o. by largely white medical personel.<br>
to give other examples of how the media manipulates minds in order to shed a better light on blacks during katrina,<br>
1. black policemen taking part in the looting of department stores was downplayed or ignored by news cameras.<br>
2. to help even out all the dastardly deeds that were being done almost exclusively by blacks, someone decided it would be a good idea to import a black general to help qualm the violence. everyone remembers general honoree, the foul-mouthed arrogant light-skinned black who strutted around, yelling obscenities to national guard and local police demanding better performance. once the media realized he was doing more to solidify a black stereotype of a black in charge and loosing emotional control, they contrated their coverage to other things.<br>
3. hardly any coverage was given to the cowardly and confused black mayor, ray nagin, who set up his &#8221;headquarters&#8221; seventeen floors up in a hotel across the street from the courthouse with no electricity = no elevators. he viewed the mayhem through binoculars. no one could reach him directly for comment or otherwise due to his isolation. shortly thereafter, rather than being useful as a mayor, he and his family moved to dallas, tx&hellip;.far from the madness of n.o. and to let the largely white workers of f.e.m.a. and national guard keep peace and clean it up. he returned only after power was restored to take credit for it and assure everyone n.o. would remain a &#8221;chocolate city&#8221; because &#8221;god wanted it to be a chocolate city&#8221;. this statement was so contoversial the media had to cover it.<br>
these facts can be substantiated by dr. douglas brinkley, a presidential historian who was a professor at the university of new orleans at the time. the name of the book was &#8221;the great deluge; hurricane katrina and the aftermath. dr. brinkey is an academic liberal who was merely telling his account. </p>
<p>i live in louisiana as well. our area of the state was hit by another hurricane, rita, who wasn&rsquo;t given near the coverage since everyone here had the good sense to evacuate long before the storm rolled in. there was next to zero looting and everyone pitched in to help with the clean-up rather than taking advantage of it and going beserk. the population of cameron and lake charles, la. is overwhelmingly white. while the strength of the 2 hurricanes were roughly the same, the post-disaster behavior of the victims was totally different. <br>
i&rsquo;ll let the readers decide if race was a factor in how the aftermath played out.</p>

		<p>This points up quite a sharp cultural difference between the U.S. and Europe in their respective attitudes to crime and punishment. (Even with our growing crime rates - largely due to third-world immigration - Europe still has consistently lower homicide rates than the U.S.) </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no apologist for the so-called &#8220;sniper&#8221;, but isn&rsquo;t it quite likely that he is, as so many blacks are, a schizophrenic?</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m opposed to the death penalty (which I think barbaric and outmoded, as well as relatively ineffective as a general deterrent), but if John Allen Muhammad IS schizophrenic (or otherwise mentally ill), shouldn&rsquo;t he be put in a secure mental hospital indefinitely, rather than executed or jailed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an implacable opponent of mass immigration and multiculturalism, but isn&rsquo;t there the slightest danger here of allowing a generalised resentment of non-whites to fuel vindictiveness against an individual, and to rationalise this vengefulness as justice?</p>

<p>The death penalty is indeed largely ineffective if it isn&rsquo;t utilized effectively.  I encourage you to look at the national homicide rate as one of the scores in a sporting event.   Make a column titled &#8220;Murders&#8221; and list the annual number beneath it.  Right beside it do the same and title the column &#8220;Executions&#8221;.  It is pretty obvious who is winning this macabre game&hellip; <br>

		<p>I can imagine the uproar that would&rsquo;ve been caused if a white police official would&rsquo;ve said, &#8220;Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe we are dealing with a pair of black serial killers here.&#8221; The white policeman would&rsquo;ve been called every racist name in the book, been at the very least suspended, and very possibly given his discharge papers and been shown the door. Yet he would&rsquo;ve been correct. </p>
