<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=105&amp;sid=1753375">German Court Lets Boy Be Named &#8216;Djehad&rsquo;  &mdash;  Holy War</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WTOP-AM/FM (Washington, D.C.), September 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Berlin court has upheld rulings in favor of parents who sought to name their son Djehad, a variation on the Arabic &#8220;jihad,&#8221; or holy war.</p>
<p>The superior court upheld two lower court rulings allowing the name on grounds that it is recognized for males in Arabic-speaking countries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the court said in a ruling Tuesday that the name&rsquo;s meaning is rooted in the requirement to spread the Muslim faith, although it has recently become linked _ especially since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks _ with radical Islam.</p>

		<p>&#8220;German authorities who register births had objected to the name, saying it could be harmful for the child given the associations with Islamic terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is more interesting for what it says about the tyrannical German state than anything else.</p>

		<p>I am of the understanding that the concept of <i>djihad</i>, usually shortened to lose the first letter, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily require Muslims to commit physical violence in the name of the faith.  That there are other interpretations and sects of Islam that interpret djihad as Christians are told to be &#8220;salt and light&#8221; of the world, in other words, an innocuous call to peaceful proselytization.  </p>
<p>However, the reason why &#8220;jihad&#8221; has become a synonym for holy war and terrorism is because the interpretations of Islam and the Koran are predominant in the Muslim world, and the reason for that is innate racial jealousy of whites, those interpretations do read &#8220;jihad&#8221; as a call for violence.</p>
<p>In other words, if (real) Swedes were Muslims, and only (real) Swedes were Muslims, &#8220;jihad&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t have violent connotations.</p>

		<p>Literally it means &#8220;struggle&#8221; and yes, it is a traditional name in Arab countries.  Speaking of struggle, I can think of far more worthy causes that we need to struggle with than this.</p>

<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know how accurate that is, but if you could plausibly entertain the remotest possibility of it being true, even for a second, the situation is unquestionably serious and totally unacceptable.   </p>

		<p><i>Is there anyone in Germany named Adolf these days?</i><br/>
More than one person had the name Adolph. It is a historical name, so I doubt it&rsquo;s banned.  But it&rsquo;s extremely rare, for obvious reasons, and frowned upon.</p>
<p><i>Would the limp-wristed German order forbid that name?</i></p>
<p>At the least, it would be very unpopular. <br/>
Germany  (though this is never mentioned) is still an occupied country. Foreign bases remain; no peace treaty has ever been signed. Germans are not free to do as they wish   &mdash;   even if they wanted to, and by this point most of them don&rsquo;t know what they want.</p>
<p>There are many once-common German names that are now rare. There is no law against them, but they are out of favor. Ingeborg, Hildegard, Siegfried&hellip;. <br/>
All too Germanic!  Anything too Germanic is out. Germany is ashamed of being German.</p>

		<p>Actually, a similar thing was allowed or accepted in America way back in 1971.  When the American Indian Movement occupied Alcatraz, claiming it belonged to them, one of thier number was a young Indian named &#8220;White Man Killer.&#8221;  You would think that a name that seems to confess the crime of murder would have moved someone to question, investigate, or at least remark at the confrontative nature of it.  But no one said anything.  The name is recorded in all histories of the American Indian Movement&rsquo;s activities when Dennis Banks, a Souix rabble rouser led it.  Rather than a prison sentence, Banks has been given many perks, even roles in movies.  He plays The Last Mohican in the 1990 movie of the same name.  But listening to him speak, even today, it is obvious that he is full of hatred for the white race.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t think Germany had that many Arabs, I thought it was primarily Turks but I&rsquo;m sure that has changed by now. <br/>
I don&rsquo;t see how giving your kid a traditional name from you ancient culture is any worse than making up names like Shaniqua. The problem is that their culture doesn&rsquo;t belong in Germany. </p>

		<p>&#8220;After all, it won&rsquo;t be all that long before Germany <i>is </i> an Arabic-speaking country.&#8221;</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t even be that simple.  It will be chaos.  Most of the Moslems are in fact Turks. But there are a great many Arabs too. And now there are Kurds, Afghans, Pakistanis, etc.  Many of them hating each other with long-festering ancient feuds.</p>
<p>Indeed, all of teeming South Asia is presently there, from Vietnam and Thailand, across India and Pakistan, through Iran and Iraq to Lebanon and Syria. And then on across Egypt and North Africa too.  It represents the whole Islamic world!  The only thing they have in common is being Moslem, and being non-European (thus anti-German).</p>
<p>It is shaping up into a Tower of Babel &hellip; a formula for much trouble to come.  None of this ever had to happen if they hadn&rsquo;t imported the &#8220;Guest Workers&#8221; in the first place, or sent them  home when their contracts were finished.  Now, Germany has their grandchildren to deal with, by the millions.  It&rsquo;s becoming evident that importing the Guest Workers for their labor was never the real motive at all,  just a way of getting them into the country to destroy the native population and culture.<br/>

		<p>An interesting point that was not mentioned in the article is that the father of the child is Reda S., a terrorist, who is said to have been involved in the bombings in Bali in 2002. His first wife divorced him in 2001 after she found out about his connections to terrorist organizations. Mere sidenotes, that did not stop the Federal Republic of Germany LLC from making him a German citizen.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m trying to imagine a registration authority in America, forbidding names that could be bad for children.  Would names like Letalvis and Domineeka be forbidden?  How about Formika Dinette and Kleenexia (oh, if only I were making these up&hellip;)?  Lemonjello and Orangello? (still real)&hellip;Pajamas?  La Trash?  Oh, where is that list of names I&rsquo;ve heard on the news&hellip;</p>
<p>But Germany also forbids its subjects free access to vitamins.  So telling them what they can name their children is minor in comparison.</p>

		<p>Arabs are quite rare in Germany. Most of the Muslims are Turks or from Turkey (Kurds, etc&hellip;) and technically Caucasians.</p>
<p>Turks (1,5 - 2 Mil), Italians (around 600.000) and former Yugoslavians (~800.000) make up the bulk of foreign population in Germany. Situation is far better than in Britain, France or the Netherlands. Blacks are rare except the extreme West and ultra liberal big cities like Berlin, Hamburg or Cologne.</p>
<p>(Former) Eastern Germany is probably 99% German, the rest are almost completely of Eastern European origin.</p>
<p>Poster #6, Germany is well on it&rsquo;s way to being an Arab majority country. I have heard that by 2015, 65% of all babies born in Germany will be of Arab descent.</p>
<p>This is utterly wrong, even by 2115, 65% of all babies will not be of Arab descent.</p>

<p>I suspect what he really meant was that they will be Moslems. <br/>
Yes, most Moslems in Germany are Turks.  But many people interchange all Moslems with Arabs. That&rsquo;s wrong, of course, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t see the difference.</p>

<p>Germany will never be a Muslim country because Muslims in Germany aren&rsquo;t procreating rapidly unlike in the UK or France (They have still a higher birthrate than Turks in Turkey who are below replacement level [1,89 according to CIA].) though.</p>

<p>I just flew back from Frankfurt several days ago.  I know Frankfurt well, and I can tell you that downtown Frankfurt   &mdash;   just like most other large German cities   &mdash;   seems to be  full of  Arabs, Turks, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis, Egyptians, Moroccans, Somalis &hellip; whatever.   They are simply EVERYWHERE.  In those areas they already seem to be the majority. The whole  proliferating Islamic world is there in force;  and quibbling about which nationality they come from is irrelevant.  Furthermore, quibbling about their birth rate  (which is unquestionably very high) is irrelevant too because there are hundreds of millions back home who are just waiting to come to Europe and join them   &mdash;    just as soon as cousin Ahmed sends them the money or comes home to find a bride.  </p>
<p>To walk through any major European airport is to see the whole Third World on the move. Most of it seems to be Islamic.   We are witnessing history taking place before our eyes!  What we are seeing in this massive migration is the demise of Europe, but the European politicians are blind to it.  They do not see what is apparent to everyone else.  Nor can anyone  say anything.  Not unless you want to tangle with the law.  That would be racist!  Strictly  verboten!</p>
<p>To say that &#8220;Germany will never be Moslem&#8221; is nonsense  when one considers that all of this incredible demographic transformation which has taken place under our noses, came about within merely  several decades    &mdash;   within the lifetimes of most people now living.   Seen in the historical scale, that is just a blip of time.  What will it be in a century?  In two centuries?  This historically unprecedented invasion is a silent conquest,  and all of this without a shot being fired!   Europe is dying, but is it by suicide or homicide?</p>
