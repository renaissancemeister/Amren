			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Pflanz, London Telegraph, September 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>British diplomats in Khartoum have demanded that the vehicles, computers, office equipment, medical stores and cash be returned so that it can be redistributed.</p>
<p>But Sudanese officials have scoffed at this, saying that neither the British government nor the aid agencies have &#8220;the right to control these assets&#8221;.</p>
<p>Up to £500,000 worth of British-funded goods were seized from groups primarily working in Darfur, according to the Department for International Development.</p>
<p>Khartoum took the assets when it expelled 13 aid agencies in March in apparent retaliation for President Omar al Bashir being indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have made it clear to the Sudanese government that all seized goods must be returned and are now discussing how best to reassign these assets to ongoing humanitarian efforts,&#8221; a spokesman for DfID said in a statement.</p>
<p>In total, Oxfam and Medecins Sans Frontieres&rsquo; French and Dutch operations have reported that they lost roughly £3.25 million of equipment.</p>
<p>They had also been forced to pay another £5.6 million to Sudanese staff as lay-off payments because of the shutdown.</p>
<p>Sudan has demanded the right to redistribute the materials to its choice of aid agencies working in Darfur.</p>
<p>But there are grave fears that they might end up in the hands of organisations without the necessary experience, meaning millions of pounds of British aid will go to waste.<br>

<p>Until or unless those in the west who plead for aid to help those who are incapable of helping themselves are told to bug-off, the west is on the hook to pay the bill.</p>
<p>We need a website called www.black_hole.com that exposes the folly of trying to help blacks anywhere, any time, under any condition.</p>

		<p>The Western Nations are totally completely INSANE! These &#8220;victims&#8221; HATE you and will gladly destroy you and your family. Who in their right mind respects or appreciates someone who is constantly giving them something for nothing? And then add misplaced GUILT on top of the givers stupidity and what do you have? A race of people not long for this world.</p>

<p>No, they were not forced, the Aid organizations should have just left and given their Sudanese workers nothing since it was the Sudanese government that stole the equipment.  To have your equipment stolen and then make unemployment compensation is insane.  Let the Sudanese pay the Sudanese.  It is time to let these savage nations go their own way.  They will reform when they get sick of the hideous lives they live.</p>

<p>This made me laugh.</p>
<p>The book &#8216;Lords of Poverty&rsquo; was published 20 years ago.  Back then the (British) author was decrying the waste of billions in Africa.</p>

		<p>Simple solution.  Let whites help only WHITES.  If the blacks need help, let them get it from other blacks.  Preferably with money or property they have NOT stolen from whites.</p>

		<p>Remember when American ships were giving American aid to those countries affected by the huge tidal waves a few years back?  Americans were SHOCKED that one of the people accepting the aid had a t shirt with a picture of Bin Laden on it. Only Whites would hand out freebies to someone who openly stated his hatred for white Americans.</p>

		<p>We should not do anything to help Darfurians. These worthless people won&rsquo;t do anything to help themselves. I was reading about conditions in one of many refugee camps there. The aid workers said that this particular camp held tens of thousands of Darfurians, a great many of them able-bodied men. And many of them had guns. But they do absolutely nothing to fight off the Janjaweed invaders and defend their families. They send their women and girls into the bush to fetch firewood and water knowing full well that they will get raped and worse, while these brave men sit on their tuckuses playing cards under a tree. One story really sums it up: A woman went into the bush to get firewood, got gang-raped and was sent back into the refugee camp stark naked, injured and humiliated. Any sympathy from her brethren? They all came out of their makeshift huts, not to offer assistance, but to mercilessly POINT and LAUGH at her agony.  Can you imagine White people acting like these animals? DO NOT HELP AFRICANS. </p>

That is totally the truth!! I have suggested that many times to others in conversations about these situations. I would love to see ALL western money, doctors, entrepreneurs, businesses and missionaries vacate that accursed continent and stand back and see what happens. I think we all know what would happen&hellip;.</p>

<p>The USA has given money to countries all over the world that hate our guts. It is insane. These people do not respect us for our wimpiness nor appreciate it one bit. I don&rsquo;t believe in foreign aid. The government has NO right to take taxes from the hard work of citizens and hand it over to other nations. The money from taxes should go to the betterment of a nation&rsquo;s people, not some other nation&rsquo;s people.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t call the article to mind, but I read somewhere that the population of Ethiopia has doubled since we raced in to save them from starvation 25 years ago.  That is, they have doubled their numbers without anywhere&rsquo;s near the means to feed themselves, except with the White man&rsquo;s free food.  The cessation of Western aid will mean the death by starvation of tens (hundreds?) of millions, plus however many more will die by violence in the struggle to grab what food exists.  Given the way Africans have treated the White farmers who fed them in Rhodesia and South Africa, I suspect that anyone fool enough to plant crops will be forced at gunpoint to reap them and hand the harvest over.  The gun trumps the plow.  </p>
<p>The West has three choices with regard to African food issues: Feed them indefinitely, go over and recolonize the place and force them to behave, or turn our backs.  Prepare to change the channel when the news crews show the pitiful pictures of starving children.  In twenty years, if they live, they&rsquo;ll be the AK wielding thugs seizing the food shipments and supplies of the silly White benefactors.</p>
