			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Shipman and Dan Newling, Daily Mail (London), Sept. 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attorney General Baroness Scotland faced humiliation last night over employing an illegal immigrant. </p>
<p>The Border Agency launched an inquiry and the government&rsquo;s senior lawyer faced the prospect of a fine of up to £10,000 and even a &#8216;raid&rsquo; on her home. </p>
<p>Lady Scotland employed Tongan cleaner Loloahi Tapui, 27, as a housekeeper for six months  &mdash;  even though she had overstayed her student visa by five years and had no right to work here.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail can reveal that Miss Tapui was refused a visa renewal not once but twice  &mdash;  yet immigration officials did nothing to deport her. </p>
<p>Despite Lady Scotland&rsquo;s attempts to draw a line under the affair, senior government sources were expressing doubts that she can survive. </p>
<p>One former Labour minister said: &#8216;If this were America, she would already have had to resign.&rsquo; </p>
<p>&#8216;No Attorney General in modern political history has faced such a scandal.&rsquo; </p>
<p> Lady Scotland fired Miss Tapui on Wednesday after the Mail revealed she was working illegally. She denied knowing the Tongan was an illegal migrant. </p>
<p>The spectacle of Britain&rsquo;s top law officer under investigation for breaking the laws she is supposed to enforce is a grave embarrassment to the government. Lady Scotland has even managed to fall foul of a measure she helped steer through Parliament when she was a Home Office minister, the 2006 Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act. </p>
<p>Under the act, it is a civil offence to employ an illegal  &mdash;  whether or not the employer knows their status. </p>
<p>Since the legislation came into force last year, the Border Agency has launched 9,547 raids on employers. Some 2,400 cases have resulted in fines, totalling more than £23million. </p>
<p>The Home Office said Lady Scotland will definitely face a penalty  &mdash;  a fine of up to £10,000  &mdash;  if Border Agency officials find Miss Tapui was working illegally, something she has admitted. </p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8216;Everyone found to be in breach of the rules is issued with a notice of liability. They get a penalty and then they can appeal.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The standard fine for employing a single illegal immigrant is £5,000. </p>
<p>Senior figures in Westminster said that if Lady Scotland escapes with a smaller penalty, or no punishment at all, it would provoke accusations of special treatment. </p>
<p>Lady Scotland faces awkward questions about the checks she made on Miss Tapui, whose 2003 student visa expired the following year. </p>
<p>Two attempts to renew it, in 2004 and 2005, were rejected by immigration officials, who told her to appeal or leave the country. </p>
<p>Yet the Attorney General&rsquo;s spokeswoman has said Lady Scotland personally inspected documents provided by Miss Tapui, which showed the cleaner was entitled to work in the UK. </p>
<p>Lady Scotland&rsquo;s only hope of avoiding a fine will be to produce copies of the documents and prove she did everything possible to ascertain whether or not they were forgeries. </p>
<p>But her spokeswoman has refused to say whether she has copies, or even what paperwork she scrutinised. </p>
<p>If it could be proved that Lady Scotland knew about Miss Tapui&rsquo;s illegal status, she could face criminal charges and a possible two-year prison sentence. </p>
<p>Last night the Tories challenged the Attorney General to produce the paperwork. </p>
<p>Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said: &#8216;There&rsquo;s no possible way the system can remain credible unless she is treated the same as everyone else. </p>
<p>&#8216;This is a real hammer blow for the credibility of the government&rsquo;s rhetoric on immigration. </p>
<p>&#8216;To have a senior minister in this position will just make the small business community think this government does not practise what it preaches.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The scandal has also drawn attention to the complete failure of communication between HM Revenue and Customs and the Border Agency. </p>
<p>Miss Tapui, who was given a National Insurance number when she was on a legitimate student visa, was able to use the same number to keep working for five years. </p>
<p>The Department of Work and Pensions confirmed yesterday there is &#8216;no mechanism&rsquo; for withdrawing an NI number when a visa expires. </p>
<p>Lady Scotland&rsquo;s aides launched a damage limitation exercise, stressing she believes &#8216;due process should be followed&rsquo; in the probe of her affairs. </p>
<p>Ministerial aides also appeared to be trying to downplay the affair. </p>
<p>A senior government source said: &#8216;This is not exactly a warehouse full of illegal workers. It&rsquo;s a low key issue.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Downing Street said Gordon Brown had read Lady Scotland&rsquo;s response to the revelations and added: &#8216;The Prime Minister has full confidence in Baroness Scotland.&rsquo; </p>
<p>But Lady Scotland&rsquo;s allies are increasingly concerned that she may be forced to resign and the opposition is scenting blood. </p>
<p>A senior Tory MP said: &#8216;I think in the end she is toast. You can&rsquo;t have the government&rsquo;s senior law officer under investigation for breaking her own laws.&rsquo; <br>

		<p>Her fast-track career seems to be a case of affirmative action during the salad days of political correctness.  According to her Wikipedia biography, </p>
<p>&#8220;Scotland was born in Dominica to Antiguan and Dominican parents, but her family moved to Walthamstow when she was three, where she went to Walthamstow School for Girls. She is the tenth of twelve children. She did an external London University (LLB) law degree in 1976. She was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1977, specialising in family and children&rsquo;s law. In 1991 she was the first black woman to be made a Queen&rsquo;s Counsel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early in 1997 she was elected as a Bencher of the Middle Temple. In 2001 she became Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s Department, and was made a member of the Privy Council. Scotland was a contender for a cabinet position in 2003, when Tony Blair reportedly considered appointing her Leader of the House of Lords.</p>
<p>&#8220;On 28 June 2007, Lady Scotland was appointed Attorney General by the new Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. She is the first woman to hold the office since its foundation in 1315.&#8221;</p>

ABC is running an animated series called &#8220;The Goode Family&#8221;.</p>
<p>In this episode, they take in a refuge and since they don&rsquo;t want to impose their imperialist value on her, they end up treating her like slave labor:</p>

		<p>We have 2.5 million registered unemployed British people but this senior minister in our failed communist labour government decided to hire an alien as a domestic servant. The investigation must include a full disclosure as to what approaches were made by the AG to her local Jobcentre in an effort to recruit a registered unemployed British National and exactly how the AG came to know that this illegal immigrant was seeking employment along with a disclosure of exactly who introduced Miss Tapui to the AG as a prospective employee. To admit that the DWP has no mechanism for cancelling a NI registration is just one more failing on the part of this anti-English government and is one more reason for a total overhaul of the entire immigration system. There is absolutely no reason for British soldiers to be killed and maimed in Afghanistan when the bulk of the enemy is from Pakistan including many who have travelled from the northern towns of England having been freely admitted into the UK by this labour government in an effort to boost postal ballots for past and forthcoming elections. We have far too many foreign born people promoted into positions of power, not only as senior and junior government ministers within the House of Parliament but within local authorities dealing with housing and schooling allocations and able to promote their own particular race or religion ahead of the British population and to the detriment of our country. This AG is certainly not the first non-British senior Minister to be caught out in similar vein and it&rsquo;s amazing that so many think they can simply break the law with impunity. Of course she should resign forthwith and stop wasting the time of her expensive taxpayer funded &#8216;aides&rsquo; in defending her position when she, as an individual, in under investigation. This could lead to a flood of appeals from others who have been found guilty of employing illegals and will now say &#8216;if the AG can do it, then so can I&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Latest news, the police have raided the cleaner&rsquo;s home (smashing the front door down) gathering, I guess, evidence to strengthen their case as the bleeding heart liberals in the UK will have a field day with this one, but most public opinion is that the Baroness, a political appointment by a now failed Labour (Democrat.- socialist) govt. must be charged and punished for deliberately breaking her own sponsored and written by her in part,law.  Hoist by her own petard.</p>

		<p>That whole Labour government is rotten to the core. From Gordon Brown doing prime minister impressions to the lowest official, it&rsquo;s rotten the whole way thru.<br>
I don&rsquo;t beleive the Tories would be any better either.<br>
England you have some choices to make, very important choices!!</p>

She isn&rsquo;t British.  She is an affirmative action immigrant from some third world island.  Glad this blew up in the face of anti Whtie racist Gordon Brown.</p>

		<p>Patricia Mawhinney, AKA Baroness Scotland, has another skeleton in the cupboard which appears to have been buried over the past week.  Namely, she has been bogusly claiming expenses for a second home in London.  This amounts to over £40K over a period of 4 years. This information was mentioned in early reports of Pat&rsquo;s shady dealings. However, in the excitement this fact appears to have been lost in the excitement&hellip;.never to be mentioned again? </p>

<p>Yes, I WAS right&hellip;.within 24 hours of the news breaking of Pat&rsquo;s claiming of £170K for fiddled housing expenses, the House of Lords changed the rules to get Pat off the hook. Well done, lads. <br>
