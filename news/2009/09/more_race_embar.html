			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Graham Smith, Daily Mail (London), September 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An adviser to Barack Obama has claimed school massacres are only carried out by &#8216;suburban white kids&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Van Jones, the US president&rsquo;s Special Advisor for Green Jobs, was calling for more attention to be paid to alienated white youth when he made his gaffe.</p>
<p>Referring to the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, in which two white teenagers shot dead 12 pupils and a teacher before killing themselves, Mr Jones said &#8216;a black kid is not going to shoot up the whole school&rsquo;.</p>
<p>His comments were revealed no sooner than he had been forced to apologise twice for other slip-ups.</p>
<p>He first had to say sorry for calling Republicans &#8216;a********&rsquo; and then when it emerged he had signed a petition that claimed George W Bush&rsquo;s officials &#8216;may indeed have deliberately allowed 9/11 to happen, perhaps a pretext for war&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is unclear why the interview, recorded in 2005, has been unearthed now but it will raise further questions about his involvement with the White House and put the spotlight once again on race which is already a flashpoint for the President.</p>
<p>It risks re-igniting the row over race sparked when President Obama spoke out weeks ago after a white policeman arrested a black Harvard professor.</p>
<p>Mr Jones said: &#8216;Young white males are suffering in this society. Profoundly. And nobody is saying a word about it.</p>
<p>&#8216;We&rsquo;ll criminalise the black student, criminalise the Latino child .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that young white boy is sitting there suffering. You&rsquo;ve never seen a Columbine done by a black child. Never.</p>
<p>&#8216;They always say &#8220;We can&rsquo;t believe it happened here, we can&rsquo;t believe it was these suburban white kids.&#8221; It&rsquo;s only them.</p>
<p>&#8216;Now, a black kid might shoot another black kid. He&rsquo;s not going to shoot up the whole school.</p>
<p>&#8216;But these young white men will be in so much pain and are so isolated, so alienated that they&rsquo;ll shoot up the entire school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went on: &#8216;And it is doubly twisted because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rather than punish you and attack you and jump on you like we do with the black kids we&rsquo;ll just ignore you and neglect you.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is just as evil  &mdash;  in my view  &mdash;  to attack these young black and brown men .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [as it is] to neglect and to ignore these young white men who as best I can tell have very little in the way of loving, affirmative male leadership.</p>
<p>&#8216;That is the problem that gets masked over by calling any community evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Jones was talking at a lecture series held in San Francisco in December 2005 called IONS Conversations at the Edge when he made the comments.</p>
<p>They have emerged weeks after Mr Obama said police officers had &#8216;acted stupidly&rsquo; when arresting black Harvard University Professor Henry Gates at his home.</p>
<p>Following complaints from police, the President quickly backtracked and acknowledged he should have used different language to express his concerns, before inviting the two men involved to join him for a beer at the White House.</p>
<p>Last year, when he was campaigning for the presidency, Mr Obama was forced to publicly condemn racially-charged sermons made by his former pastor.</p>
<p>In a sermon, Reverend Jeremiah Wright Jr. used an offensive racial term to argue that Mr Obama&rsquo;s then Democrat rival for the White House Hillary Clinton could never understand the struggles of African-Americans.</p>
<p>Speaking on Christmas Day 2007, Rev Wright said: &#8216;Barack knows what it means, living in a country and a culture that is controlled by rich white people.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hillary can never know that. Hillary ain&rsquo;t never been called a n*****.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Only suburban white kids shoot up at school?  So it&rsquo;s safe to move back into the ghetto and enroll your kids in ghetto schools, right?</p>
<p>I think the reason why there aren&rsquo;t these &#8220;supernova&#8221; type school shootings at black schools at the hands of blacks is that those sorts drop out of school before they can cause any real trouble, and are up to no good outside of school.</p>

You&rsquo;ve never seen a Columbine done by a black child. Never&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..Not True Not True. In 1988 a black 16 year old shot up his school. One of the first columbine style shootings. So as a percentage of the population blacks are more likely to shoot up their school than white students. Not to mention that more black students drop out of high school before they get the chance.</p>

		<p>One thug down. How many more to go? This was one classy guy, wasn&rsquo;t it? Obama spoke out loud and clear asking us to watch who he surrounds himself with. We came. We saw. We didn&rsquo;t like. How many more like this are &#8220;advising&#8221; the President? The man&rsquo;s radical views and his language do not belong anywhere near the White House.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t bother that these black activists speak their mind.  That isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad. I wish we had more white leaders that did the same.</p>
<p>What bothers me is that these same black leaders are always against any solution that involves segregation.  If he had pointed out that white kids and black kids have different behavior problems that can be best addressed in a segregated school, it would not have been objectionable.  </p>
<p>Instead of pointing out symptoms isn&rsquo;t it time to point out the solution.  Wouldn&rsquo;t segregation clear up a lot of these problems, at least it would for whites.</p>

		<p>&#8220;He went on: &lsquo;And it is doubly twisted because &hellip; rather than punish you and attack you and jump on you like we do with the black kids we&rsquo;ll just ignore you and neglect you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is just as evil &mdash; in my view &mdash; to attack these young black and brown men &hellip; [as it is] to neglect and to ignore these young white men who as best I can tell have very little in the way of loving, affirmative male leadership.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, what this clumsy fool is trying to do is make it appear as if whites are not punished but blacks are.  It&rsquo;s more of the same attempts to try to intimidate white school officials nationwide into being more reluctant to discipline black thugs who are the chief trouble-makers at every school.  The reason for it is too many blacks are getting kicked out of school, missing too much school due to too many being expelled for lengthy periods, and others dropping out rather than face discipline.  All of it together results in a drop out rate of black males in the 60% PLUS range.</p>
<p>You see, if he just fools the honkies into thinking they&rsquo;re racist for disciplining black kids, then black disciplinary action will be substantially reduced and more blacks will stay in school and Voila! the black graduation rate goes up.  How stupid.  What an absolutely dumb way to try to increase graduation percentages, as if it would do blacks any good anyway.</p>
<p>White kids are disciplined too.  This black moron isn&rsquo;t clever enough to create in the minds of anybody with half a brain that it is only blacks who are disciplined, and because whites aren&rsquo;t, then shootings like Columbine occur.</p>
<p>How utterly childish and naive and how easy his moronic attempts at psyching whitey is to see through.  And this is SUPPOSED to be a Yale graduate?  Absurd.  Utterly absurd.</p>
<p>This simpleton would be the best weapon we could possibly have for drawing whites closer if he had been allowed to stay and continue his asinine, nitwit analogies and allegations.</p>
<p>Those who said Obama&rsquo;s election would wake whites up to the deceitfulness of blacks, their lack of intelligence, their militancy, but, most of all, their jealousy and resentment of whites that has turned into hatred, are going to be proven right as this media annoited one continues on with the many gaffes he has made and the ones he WILL MAKE from this point forward.</p>
<p>Who would have known about all these despicable white hating blacks like Jones and Jeremiah Wright if Obama were not elected?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just waiting for this Michelle Obama to enter the picture somehow, either through her own anger and impatience or through exposes like Glenn Beck makes.  It will be at that time we will be REALLY introduced to her anti-white fervor and racism.  That will be just one more reason for this man&rsquo;s poll numbers to drop to basement levels.</p>
<p>Get ready.  If he starts to really fail badly, look for blacks to mouth many insinuations and out and out threats, putting whites on notice that they better back off or black rioting is coming down.</p>
<p>Keep in mind.  Obama has an army of his own, and they&rsquo;re all black.</p>

		<p>More likely to shoot up a school? So why are the black schools filled with barbed wire and metal detectors, armed school police and battered teachers. My first son starts High School tomorrow and his Campus looks like a clean version of a Community college at 99% white. The high school 40 miles away looks like a Prison at 30% black. What about words like Drive-by? Unknown in White culture, it means the assassination of children BY children using firearms from a moving vehicle. If a single incident like Columbine defines Whites then random massacres at parties, Proms, block parties, even political events, so numerous as to be only reported on local news, defines Blacks. </p>

<p>It sounds to me like not only is this guy smearing whites as mass murderers, but he&rsquo;s trying, in an underhanded way, to pretend he has sympathy for &#8220;troubled&#8221; white students while in reality showing his real sympathies lie with the black students. Did anyone else notice this?</p>
<p>Exactly who &#8220;punishes and attacks&#8221; the black kids? Is he saying that normal discipline is somehow &#8220;atacking&#8221;  blacks?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a semi-clever, underhanded twist&hellip;pretending he&rsquo;s showing sympathy for whites while really smearing them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;ve never seen a Columbine done by a black child. Never.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never heard of it, is all.</p>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s high school in LA was overrun by a black gang in 1979.  It had already had the chain link fences installed.  The blacks were just beating up every white kid, male or female they could get their hands on.  The kids were trying to get over the fence.  My wife had already transferred out to a private school because of the black boy who broke into her locker routinely, just to let her know that he could.  She had to keep her books in the principals office.  Finally, her parents got her out of there.</p>
<p>Like the riots at my high school in 1971, this, and who knows who many other acts of mass violence against white students in schools nationwide have occurred.  And the individual acts are astronomical.  </p>
<p>And I think I can recall a few non-white school shoot-em ups lately.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see. Using black logic(?) I think this calls for a billion<br>
or so program directed to White students to build their self-esteem.  Could years of affirmative action, seeing black kids who shoot hoops rather than study get college and job preference destroy the minds of these White youth?</p>
<p>Maybe blacks should be separated to protect them from marauding<br>
bands of Whites.</p>
<p>Look how prejudice has caused obesity, hypertension and every other problem blacks have. What else could cause Whites kids to<br>
do this?</p>

		<p>The saddest thing about all this is that if Van Jones had been white and said exactly the same things about blacks, it would boil up into a 6 month long racism-fest, joyfully propagated 24-7 by the mainstream media. However, this man and his life-long vocal despising of whites will fade into obscurity posthaste.</p>

		<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg headed for our already sinking ship.  As Blacks and Hispanics gain more and more power in the White world they will use it to destroy us.  They have no &#8220;nobles oblige&#8221;, Whites are the only ones that possess this trait.  Our good nature and generosity in assisting these groups to power is starting to show itself as our undoing.  I fear there is going to be great hardship and bloodshed before the majority of Whites finally wake up.</p>

<p>What happened at Columbine required serious planning, delay of gratification &amp; disciplined follow through.  DON&rsquo;T THINK FOR A SECOND I&rsquo;M CONDONING WHAT THEY DID, but Dylan and Kleybold (sp?) put a lot of time and effort into the massacre.  They planned for months, obtained guns while being underaged, practiced shooting, built 60+ large &amp; small bombs, and developed an elaborate plan to blow up the school, shoot fleeing survivors and then blow up emergency responders with car bombs.  If their big, propane-tank bomb had not failed to detonate, the death toll would have been much greater.  And then, when things did not go according to plan, they improvised on the spot and still succeeded with their evil intentions. </p>
<p>How many blacks can plan more than a day ahead?  How many blacks could devise such a complex plan, and muster the energy to follow through?  How many blacks have the patience to wait until their plan is complete, and the quick-thinking to improvise when things go wrong?  </p>
<p>Too bad Dylan &amp; Kleybold were so badly twisted, because their intelligence, energy and self-motivation is evident.  </p>

This may be true, but rarely, however inner city ghetto rats terrify entire neighborhoods on a daily basis with all manner of weapons.<br>

<p>Hey, I bet White kids must be alienated, in the States! I mean, having to grow up in a society that tells them Blacks are such great people while Whites are evil people who can&rsquo;t dance! Then, there&rsquo;s the affirmative action thing&hellip;<br>
