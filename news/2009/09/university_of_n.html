			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amber Hunt and Tammy Stables Battaglia, Detroit Free Press, Sept. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>First, the shots rang out. Then came the screams. </p>
<p>A woman&rsquo;s lifeless body lay on the cement. The man who had shot her was down, too, a self-inflicted gunshot to his head, his breathing too shallow to detect.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pleas were useless: Canton police said that 33-year-old Patricia Williams, a Detroit police officer, was already dead, and her killer and husband  &mdash;  Detroit homicide Detective Edward Williams, 36  &mdash;  had fatally turned the gun on himself.</p>
<p>The Tuesday morning deaths were a marriage of two endemic problems plaguing police departments nationwide, experts said: domestic violence and suicides.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to data compiled by WSU, Detroit officers face a higher suicide rate than most police, at 28 per 100,000 police officers, nearly twice as many as New York City police.</p>
<p>Also, marriages involving police officers are two to four times more likely to involve domestic violence.</p>
<p>Detroit cops lead nation in suicides</p>
<p>Canton police trying to piece together what led a Detroit Police Department homicide investigator to shoot and kill his wife, then himself, face an uncomfortable reality: More police officers kill themselves in Detroit than in other big cities nationwide, and police in general have higher rates of domestic violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Details of the shooting deaths were still guarded Tuesday, but police said trouble had been brewing between Edward, 36, and Patricia Williams, 33  &mdash;  also a Detroit police officer  &mdash;  for days, prompting a domestic complaint to be filed with Canton Police over the weekend.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a male friend of Patricia Williams called police about 8:30 a.m. to report there had been another incident.</p>
<p>The caller said Patricia Williams was on her way to the Police Department, Canton Police spokesman Mark Gajeski said. She never made it.</p>
<p>Instead, she parked her silver late-model BMW a couple of spaces down from her husband&rsquo;s sleek black Dodge Charger with dark-tinted windows along the side of the library parking lot.</p>
<p>&#8220;He called her, and he got her to come over to the library and talk to him,&#8221; Gajeski said, looking at the couple&rsquo;s cars still in the parking lot of the Canton Center Road library, the revolver used still on the ground. &#8220;That&rsquo;s when the shooting started.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The couple had no children, though Patricia Williams had a 10-year-old son from a previous marriage. He had left the Canton family&rsquo;s home in the Central Park South subdivision for school before the shooting took place, Gajeski said.</p>
<p>Ed Williams was well liked and had appeared in the A&E; program &#8220;The First 48,&#8221; a reality-based TV show that highlights the initial two days of criminal investigations.</p>
<p>He was one of several homicide investigators featured during a several-episode stint in Detroit.</p>

		<p>The rise in domestic violence and suicides among police officers is probably attributable to the use of affirmative action metrics in deciding who becomes a police officer.</p>

		<p>Gee, I feel so safe knowing that such a powerful-looking woman is protecting me and my interests.  I wonder if she had enough strength to raise her arms beyond a few seconds?  Thank you corrupt politicians for bolstering our police forces.</p>
<p>Is anybody keeping score on black on white spousal murders?  I&rsquo;m not, but it occurs so frequently I feel this is just more of the same.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think women would learn after so much has been reported about these crimes, but I guess they only read about the O.J. Simpson types and think killing two white people by a black is an anomaly.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t be the last, of course.</p>

		<p>I have zero connection to this story hence my lack of sensitivity, though my condolences do go out to the now motherless 10 yr old boy, hopefully he his a decent father who&rsquo;ll step up to the plate.</p>
<p>But here are some now ironic comments from various ladies swooning for this murderer&rsquo;s attention, inspired from his appearances on &#8216;the first 48&rsquo; (great show by the way.)</p>
<p><a href="https://boards.aetv.com/topic/Share-Your-Thoughts/Ed-Williams-Detecive/300021940&amp;start=30" rel="nofollow">https://boards.aetv.com/topic/Share-Your-Thoughts/Ed-Williams-Detecive/300021940&start;=30</a></p>
<p>A little black humor I suppose ( <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2vdapj" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2vdapj</a> .)</p>
<p>Here he is detecting&hellip;. https://tinyurl.com/ye47kyh<br>
From watching this very show I got the impression that life in  Detroit is cheap when you see the silly reason&rsquo;s some of these people get killed for (i.e. pride, $10, &#8216;for kicks&rsquo; etc.), apparentally he was unable to seperate his work and home lives.<br>

<p>So true!  I bitterly laugh to myself everytime I see another morbidly obese woman in a police or sherrif&rsquo;s uniform.  I am fit, even if I am 57, and I am unemployed, yet, I could never hope to get even an interview in our locality due to my race and gender.  <br>

		<p>A police officer with an BMW. Hell, I work 2 jobs and I can&rsquo;t afford a BMW.</p>
<p>But the real problem here as well as everywhere in the country, is, when are blacks and whites going to realize that, despite all the pandering and lies that we are told about how interracial relationships are okay, they very seldom work out and sometimes, they end tragically, as in this case.</p>

<p>There should be no surprise as the man was in law enforcement and most likely realized there would be no way for his fraternal order to protect him from the long arm on this one. A cop sent to prison would be eaten alive if not forced into protective custody. Remember, he killed a fellow cop, most frowned upon by other cops. Guilt had nothing to do with this, just simple survival tactics in not putting oneself through the legal grinder.<br>

<p>With my 79 US and foreign patents awarded, our cars consist of a 1995 Saturn SL-2, a 1931 Model-A Ford I built using the engine and tranny out of my old Mazda RX-7, and the 2002 Saturn SL-2 we bought used as a second all-weather car last December.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we don&rsquo;t have any debt, we don&rsquo;t live in Detroit and our child isn&rsquo;t a mulatto, so I don&rsquo;t feel too badly.</p>

		<p>The original story danced around the real causes of the murder suicide; white women married to blacks, and affirmative action hiring.  The sentiment of the article was&hellip;. &#8220;poor stressed out peace officers sacrificing their sanity for the citizens&hellip;&hellip; now pony up more money for higher salaries&#8221;.</p>
<p>As mentioned in a comment above both &#8220;officers&#8221; were driving fine private autos, she a late model &#8220;shinny silver BMW&#8221; and he a new car that, from the brief description in the article, was &#8220;ghettoed-out&#8221;  &mdash;    &mdash;  pimped.</p>
<p>The video that accompanied the article showed the outside of the nice house where the two &#8220;officers&#8221; lived.  It appeared to be located in an up scaled white area.</p>
<p>Now taking into account the new wheels and fine house, there has to be more to the story.  The medium salary for cops in Detroit is about $55,000 and Canton is most likely the same.  Granted he was an investigator and made a few more dollars but a good guess would be combined salaries of about $130000, give or take a few.</p>
<p>Where did the money come from to support the life style they had? One indicator of police corruption used by internal affairs is cops living well above their salaries.  Bet these two &#8220;minorities&#8221; never came under scrutiny. </p>
<p>The police investigation of this murder suicide will sanitize and/or avoid mention of unseemly causal factors. The public should be apprised of all selection criteria, training, and promotion considerations surrounding the careers of these two. This includes how these two scored on tests compared to their contemporaries. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hold your breath though, divulging the real facts would slay too many PC sacred cows.</p>
<p>There are upsides to this event however. First, and perhaps most important, Canton is now spared from two mentally unstable cops on their streets. At least these two will no longer be in position to frame anyone, give false testimony in court or otherwise bring stupidity, mistreatment, bad judgment, and lying to the streets of Canton. Any felony conviction where the testimony of either was key should be reviewed immediately.  </p>
<p>Secondly there is one less white woman showing a bad example to impressionable white girls.  One wonders how many lectures and career days these two participated in together before a group of white teenage girls.  </p>
<p>Seeing the two together, clearly sends the message that the state and society stamps such sham marriages with approval and such mating is perfectly normal, and acceptable, and even superior.  </p>
<p>After all what better way for white girls to show they are not racists, and at the same time shed their white guilt. The white girls&rsquo; parents would likely approve of the debauchery of their daughters for the same reasons. &#8220;no we are certainly not racists, why, our daughter is married to a fine young black police officer. We just adore him&hellip;they are such a fine couple&hellip;bla, bla.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually the real lesson of this event is for white girls to have nothing to do with blacks, males in particular.  Tragically the warning will again go unheard.  <br>

		<p>The problem is that those two police officers are living in Detroit, the blackest city in the United States. Detroit joins a list of Third World cities with Memphis, Baltimore, Atlanta, Oakland, Washington D.C, and others. Even though blacks are only a little over 30% of Oakland&rsquo;s population, they still dominate the politics of the city. We can all see the results of a black-dominated city. We can all see the results of a black-dominated country. Only Botswana is a somewhat stable and prosperous black-run nation. Do I deny that past oppression contributed to the wretched state of blacks today? Absolutely not. I do think that black culture and the black mentality, both born out of oppression, lead to pathologies that make themselves visible throughout the world. Blacks are not only unsuccessful in North America, but around the world. Whether it&rsquo;s Brazil in South America, the Caribbean islands, Europe, Africa, or even Australia, blacks are at the bottom of the world&rsquo;s food chain. The stress of living in a black-dominated place such as Detroit must take a toll on everyday citizens. </p>

<p>Pardon me but we&rsquo;re talking about suicide here and &#8220;survival&#8221; just doesn&rsquo;t strike me as a motive for suicide.  Perhaps you meant he was actually being selfish because he foresaw the future suffering and untimely end his actions would bring.  That, I can swallow.</p>

		<p>Affirmative Action has decimated the Police and Sheriff&rsquo;s Departments around the Country. Just look at the two photos of Detroit&rsquo;s Police, to see how low they have sunk. </p>
<p>Years ago, you needed a High School Education, when that meant something, be in top physical condition, not wear eyeglasses, or be Color blind, and be at least 5 feet 11 inches tall. </p>
<p>My father had all of those qualifications, but was not accepted into a City Police Department, because he wore eyeglasses, due to an injury, while playing Football. Never mind that my father was a Master Sergeant in the Army, and Qualified Weapons Expert.<br>
He just didn&rsquo;t qualify. </p>
<p>But, we went from requiring our Police Candidates from being the physical embodiment of Greek gods, to little more than Office Clerks, and Telephone Receptionists, in Uniform. </p>

		<p>Affirmative action in action. </p>
<p>I wonder if the increase in police domestic violence in recent years has anything to do with the fact that White men have been excluded from law enforcement jobs in the last 35 years?</p>
<p>I am totally shocked that Detroit has even 1 White police officer.  She must be the daughter of red diaper babies and the granddaughter of 1930&rsquo;s Stalin worshippers.  Probably got into the force with a recommendation from Bernadette Dohrn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted this before, but I will post it again.  I took the San Francicso police exam some years ago.  Blacks had failed the written exam for years.  The exam was re written several times, points were added to the scores of blacks but they still failed.</p>
<p>So in response to a draconian court order the examiners created an exam for adults who could not read at even 2nd grade level.</p>
<p>The exam consisted of a video of crime scenes.  Then the screen went blank.  A recorded voice asked 3 times:  </p>
<p>If the man in the white shirt was a customer fill in the circle in front of Answer A.  </p>
<p>If the man in the white shirt was the store clerk fill in the circle in front of Answer B.  </p>
<p>If the man in the white shirt was one of the robbers fill in the circle in front of Answer C.  </p>
<p>If the person in the white shirt was a woman fill in the circle in front of Answer D.</p>
<p>In other words, a police exam for those who could not read. They did however have to know the first 4 letters of the alphabet</p>
<p>That exam fulfilled the Judge&rsquo;s orders and filled the force with illiterate blacks. </p>
<p>Bit of shadenfreude all the gay White males who allied themselves with the minorities and women found themselves as discriminated against as much as the evil hetero christian bourgeois White men. So much for the rainbow coalition.</p>

		<p>In this article, it states that Mrs. Williams has been on the DPD since 1995 (pretty much shortly after high school). Through what AA program was she admitted to the force? Granted she meets at least one quota check-off box. Even if she were 6&rsquo; tall, she probably wouldn&rsquo;t weigh more than 160 lbs and doesn&rsquo;t present much of an intimidating presence. I&rsquo;m curious to know how many times she was thrown around like a rag doll in a fight with a suspect. </p>
<p>A pimped out BMW and Dodge Charger. I&rsquo;m guessing that they were either up to their necks in debt or there were nefarious money making activities on the side. But I doubt the media will question their auto purchases. <br>

		<p>Our daughters must be educated: black men can be charming extroverts, but when life pressures bear down, they are far more likely to become vicious. Also, most black men are attracted to white and Asian women for unhealthy psycho-sexual reasons coming out of a need to dominate or humiliate members of other races.</p>

		<p>TIME magazine has a big article about how Detroit can be reformed and rise again.  It is basically it is all Whtey&rsquo;s fault.  The Whites moved out of Detroit because of racism, not fear of being murdered.  If only the Whites had stayed the blacks would not have destroyed Detroit.</p>
<p>The White management of the auto companies are at fault for some reason.  I couldn&rsquo;t follow the reasoning of the article.  Also the UAW is at fault for some reason the writer was unable to articulate.</p>
<p>Whites did it.  Whites destroyed Detroit by fleeing the onslaught of black murderers and rioters leaving Detroit in the hands of blacks.</p>

		<p>Interesting fact about the Los Angeles Police Department which is now 42 percent hispanic indian and brags about that fact.</p>
<p>By the late 1940&rsquo;s under Chief Parker, all police applicants had their IQs tested.  The absolute minimum IQ for an LA officer was 110. 10 points above the average for the White race. Minimum height for men was 5ft9.  Minimum height for women 5ft6.</p>
<p>With all these indian hispanics, the average IQ in LAPD is probably about 95, barely able to graduate from high school.  The average hispanic indian officer that I see is about 40 pounds overweight.  I saw 4 hispanic indian highway patrol officers at starbucks this morning.  </p>
<p>All between 25 and 35.  All about 5ft6.<br>
All weighed about 180 to 190.  That is about 30 pounds over the ideal normal weight for a 5ft6 man.  The oldest was about 35. People gain weight after 40.</p>
<p>Such if law enforcement today.</p>
<p>Why do I pay 125 percent more for coffee at Starbucks rather than buying coffee at mcdonalds?  Because Starbucks if the only fast food chain that still hires White men.</p>

		<p>Every country deals with race differently.  The two biggest mistakes in American history once one gets beyond slavery:  (1) forced integration by court rulings - you can&rsquo;t force people to want to associate with, get along with, or respect you; and (2) affirmative action - no matter how one looks at it, it smacks of unfairness and does not make people respect you.  </p>
<p>What we have today are simply the long-term ramifications of bad racial policies.  What is perhaps more fascinating is that many think that 50 years of legal integration has somehow negated or counterbalanced the treatment afforded blacks prior thereto.</p>
<p>The reason that American society is incapable of addressing the racial issue is because we view it from the wrong perspective.  We talk all around the fundamental, underlying reasons for racism, and make it an emotional issue.    Focusing on the symptoms is an ineffective mechanism to employ.
