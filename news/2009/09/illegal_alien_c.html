			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner (Virginia), September 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Tuesday, Clark County Superior Court Judge Robert Harris set bail for Joe Juillermo Fajardo, 26, at $250,000, the Ecuadorian national was arrested in Vancouver, WA the previous Friday night and charged with first degree child molestation.</p>
<p>Deputy prosecuting attorney Mike Vaughn, said: &#8220;The defendant entered an occupied home at night, crept into the bedroom of a 5-year-old boy and proceded to rape him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Around 1:00 a.m., the child&rsquo;s mother heard her son scream, ran into his room and found Fajardo naked in her son&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The following facts help illustrate the growing epidemic of child molestation being committed by illegal aliens:</p>
<p>-Deborah Schurman-Kauflin Ph.D. of the Violent Crimes Institute reports that the U.S. illegal alien population includes at least 240,000 sex offenders. Based on various studies, it is estimated that they will commit 130,909 sex crimes annually.</p>
<p>-63 percent of the sex crimes committed by illegal aliens, were done so by previously deported criminals.</p>
<p>-Between 2003-2008, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, through Operation Predator, arrested 11,600 illegal aliens for crimes including child pornography, child sex tourism, human smuggling and trafficking of minors, and child molestation and rape.<br>

		<p>This reminds me of something I saw on the news a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>What happened was an illegal alien moved into an American trailer park. One of the neighbors was a single mother with a 9-year-old daughter. The illegal alien approached the mother one day and asked how much her daughter costs. He wanted to buy her.</p>
<p>Some time later, the 9-year-old girl was playing outside. Her mother, hearing screams, ran outside and saw the illegal alien trying to drag her into the woods so that he could rape her. She called police and the illegal alien was arrested and later deported.</p>

		<p>If that had been my son, the illegal alien would have never lived to stand trial.  Geraldo Rivera has a new book out explaining how Hispanics are going to lead America to a new era of prosperity.  Someone send him the above article with all the studies showing the rampant number of sex crimes commited by illegal aliens.  He can put that in his next book.</p>

		<p>i just can NOT for the life of me figure out why illegals just love to rape small children.  its sad, but of course if we talk about it, then we&rsquo;re racists   &mdash;   then more children die. how sad</p>

		<p>We have had two recent cases in Upstate New York.  In Saratoga Springs an illegal from Central America abducted a young white woman off the street and made her strip at gunpoint in the back of his van. The young woman managed to escape and the perp was captured and is now awaiting trial.   </p>
<p>The second case, also involving a Central American, happened when the illegal was fired from his job at a horse farm. A young mother-maybe in her 30s-was out walking on a rural road, when the illegal assaulted and raped her. This crime lasted about an hour and a half, before a passing motorist interrupted the rape. The criminal had actually booked a flight for home, so I assume he was getting his &#8216;revenge&rsquo; prior to leaving and hoping he would be long gone before the manhunt began. Another guy now awaiting trial. </p>

<p><br>
And probably came right back soon thereafter, as the article states that (incredibly!) 63% of such crimes were committed by those PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED!</p>
<p>It boggles the mind.</p>

		<p>Wow!  Let us rush to &lsquo;comprehensive immigration reform&rsquo; so we can have more like Fajardo staying in the country and entering the country.   What will we ever do without such kind souls to tend our children, mow our lawns and patch our roofs?  Here in Arizona the crime reports are replete with Spanish surnames, day in and day out.  Rivera and his tribe, mean measured IQ of 90 in the US, aren&rsquo;t leading anyone but the thieves to prosperity.<br>

		<p>I hope that the force that drove the tea parties will be in evidence when Obama hauls out his immigration reform. However, even if we&rsquo;re able to stop his amnesty freight train, illegals will remain garnering benefits and committing crimes. We need to have a modern day Eisenhower who wasn&rsquo;t so politically correct that he couldn&rsquo;t send the braceros home in the &rsquo;50s. Washington says it can&rsquo;t afford to send them home. A one way ticket by bus is a lot cheaper than what the taxpayer is shelling out now. Stop the magnet of jobs by mandating E-verify for all business, stop the birthright insanity and stop all benefits. They will leave. Two problems solved - illegals gone and Americans gone to work!</p>

<p>These are &#8220;jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221;?  So we&rsquo;re told.  Well, we USED TO!</p>

		<p>How long before Americans get it through their thick skulls that the only thing that will deter violent crime is corporal punishment.  If a man rapes a woman, he should be put to forced labor in order to pay her restitution.  Then, upon his release, he should be publicly flogged.  Illegal immigrants should lose a finger each time they&rsquo;re apprehended.  That would dampen their enthusiasm to return.  I am very serious.  They must experience actual physical pain or maiming.  Otherwise they fear nothing.</p>

		<p>Remember this when you seek the one to justify the others.  This happens every day in their native countries and they never conjure up the will to do a damn thing about it.  So why the hell do you want here.  Say something or they will speak for you.</p>

		<p>We need bounty hunters to pick up and turn in all illegals.</p>
<p>This could be a growth industry for a while, but I bet it would clear the place pretty quick.</p>
<p>The approach would be gentle to begin with and ruthless if necessary.</p>

		<p>   That grime is truly dispicable. How much more are we gonna take? By the way Geraldo Rivera is a leftist. He seeks the destruction of our beloved country thru massive immigration. Boycott this sob. When he appears on your TV- turn it to another channel. Eventually Fox will catch on Geraldo is ratings poison.</p>

<p>Did Mom not own a gun? I mean, if I was in that situation, the rapist would not have lived long enough to be judged by any mortal judge or jury. I might have had to face one, but no jury here would convict me in that situation.</p>

		<p>  If I was that child&rsquo;s mother I would of course blame the criminal, but also the criminals in D.C. that REFUSE to do their jobs! Too bad she can&rsquo;t sue all these snakes that let these invaders into the country!  These politicians are hateful, disgusting creatures, that in a just society would be thrown in jail for their treasonus negligence. In my opinion they are some of the lowest lifeforms in existence!</p>

<p>Or, he can write a book on &#8220;The Victory of the HISPANIC MAJORITY 2030&#8221;!  Why do I say 2030?  I say 2030 because I prognosticate  by that year the Hispanics will be the nation&rsquo;s majority and will be in major political positions. This will virtually enable them to take over the country! </p>

		<p>Here just one more example of why all White Americans should have guns in their homes, and on their person. If I had found this piece of garbage naked in my child&rsquo;s room, GOD forbid, I would have blown his brains out, all over the bed.</p>
<p>Calling the Police, and having this dirt bag arrested, will either get him sent to Jail for a period of time, or Deported, where he will be free to do this to other children, in his home Country.<br>
