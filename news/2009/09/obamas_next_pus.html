<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/20/obamas-next-push-is-amnesty/">Obama&rsquo;s Next Push is Amnesty</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey T. Kuhner, Washington Times, Sept. 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Amnesty is back, and with a vengeance. This was the dominant theme I heard at this week&rsquo;s annual talk-radio gabfest in Washington sponsored by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), the country&rsquo;s leading anti-amnesty organization. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>It is no surprise that, after passing health care &#8220;reform,&#8221; President Obama plans to move on to his next big domestic initiative: granting citizenship to more than 12 million illegal immigrants. For decades, Beltway and business elites have championed a policy of open borders and unlimited Third World immigration. Amnesty is simply its logical culmination: the triumph of political and corporate interests over patriotism. </p>
<p>America has endured a massive invasion of millions of illegal immigrants. The southern border is a bleeding sore. Hospitals are overwhelmed, forced to provide free medical care to illegals. School systems must absorb the unnecessary costs of educating the illegal immigrants&rsquo; children. Welfare rolls are swelling with illegal immigrants taking advantage of public assistance. Nearly one-third of the federal prison population is composed of illegal immigrants. Mexican cartels import drugs, crime and human trafficking. Washington has lost control of the nation&rsquo;s borders  &mdash;  and with it, our national sovereignty. </p>
<p>Moreover, the waves of illegal immigration represent an onslaught on America&rsquo;s historic and cultural core. The great myth of our time, promoted by both the multicultural left and the neoconservative right, is that the United States is a creedal nation. They argue that the country was founded upon abstract ideas embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and that it is united by its commitment to universal principles such as democracy and equality. This is a historical fraud. The Founding Fathers were neither democrats nor believers in egalitarianism. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}America is an outgrowth of Christianity and English civilization. Its roots are European. The previous waves of immigrants who came to its shores not only deliberately assimilated, but embraced a common national identity: They became Americans. </p>
<p>This is not the case with the army of illegal immigrants. The combination of uncontrolled immigration with multiculturalism is a recipe for balkanization  &mdash;  the fracturing of America along racial and ethnic lines. </p>
<p>Already, many Hispanic radicals, including some in the advocacy group La Raza (&#8220;the race&#8221;), are calling for the annexation of the Southwest back into Mexico. They think amnesty will accelerate the process of reacquiring former Mexican territories. For them, demography is destiny. </p>
<p>Large chunks of California, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Florida have become Spanish-speaking enclaves. They are part of the United States in name only. Immigrants are no longer required to learn English. The fastest-growing TV and radio stations are those broadcasting in Spanish. Everywhere one goes  &mdash;  ATMs, restaurants, state motor vehicle departments  &mdash;  Spanish is prevalent. Many urban schools in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York teach bilingualism. We are no longer one people who share the same language, culture, history, customs, heroes, literature and traditions. The bonds of national union are slowly being torn apart. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Obama is an internationalist socialist. His ultimate goal is to erect a liberal ruling class: to forge a Democratic majority coalition  &mdash;  one that would dominate for decades. Amnesty would put millions of illegal immigrants into the voting booths  &mdash;  and into the welcoming arms of Democrats. </p>
<p>Amnesty also would sound the death knell of traditional America. It would signify a cultural revolution, the establishment of a de facto bilingual, binational Tower of Babel. It would be Mr. Obama&rsquo;s most radical  &mdash;  and destructive  &mdash;  achievement. <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just those states mentioned in which English is no longer spoken. I was glad to move away from Vancouver, on Canada&rsquo;s west coast, because it&rsquo;s now become a Chinese enclave, and many immigrants did not seem to care about learning English.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about the Spanish language in the United States either. I was giving some training courses to a company in Wisconsin a couple of years ago. During a break, one woman told me that one of her relatives in the Minneapolis area had been instructed to learn Somali in order to better communicate with the new workers. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it - Americans being told to learn Somali in order to do business in the United States? But she swore that it actually happened.</p>
<p>Language is the key division between peoples. If you can&rsquo;t communicate, you can&rsquo;t really get together. Quebec is part of Canada, despite two sovereignty referendums, but in many respects in name only. And as one Quebec politician stated so succinctly, the ongoing language/cultural debate over Quebec separatism is like &#8220;a never ending trip to the dentist&rsquo;s office.&#8221; That, I fear, is America&rsquo;s future as well. Trust me when I say it ain&rsquo;t pretty!<br>

		<p>Great article, this is what Obama is really after, if he succeeds he could be president for life.</p>
<p>His real goal is to destroy white America and consequently all white countries from Europe.</p>
<p>He will bring millions more of non whites to America and Europe to completely destroy the white race.<br>

		<p>What strikes me most about this article is just how many Americans might read it and say, &#8220;so, what?&#8221; Since so-called &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; &#8220;diversity&#8221; and similarly alien ideals have been basically force-fed to an entire generation of citizens(and indeed, non-citizens), many just don&rsquo;t fully see the picture the article paints, and not a few are convinced this is actually GOOD for America! </p>
<p>It is hard for most of us to comprehend, but I really think this type of warning and dire prognostication is just too little too late. </p>

		<p>The first amnesty was declared by that grand old conservative scourge of the communists both in Russia wehn he was president and in America when he was an actor in the 1940&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?  None</p>

		<p>Obama maybe an international socialist he may in fact even think that millions of voting hispanics will help his popularity but Obama nor other politicians are stupid. Trust me if the politicians could stop illegal immigration they would have. They even go after any one who does try and stem the tide even though almost every American is against these illegals.</p>
<p>Now ask yourself why would politicians do something to hurt their own popularity?</p>
<p>The answer is simple really. The other choice will be more unpopular than allowing the illegals to come in. At least the politicians view it that way.</p>
<p>It takes 9 paid workers to support 1 retired person without raising medicare and Social Security rates and even that 9 to 1 ratio gives an overall loss. Within the next 3 years with the first of the baby boomer generation retirement, we will be down to 7 workers for every retired person. Within 15 years we will be down to 3 workers. They are hoping the illegals will fill this gap plain and simple. There is no way we can support the pork and social spending of the US without illegals coming here and working. The politicians will not do what is required to save us so they kill us with open borders.</p>
<p>Feminism has brought with it the deaths of millions of workers through abortion, it has also killed marriage and has decimated the original population of America. We gave the country away when we allowed so many women to &#8220;do as they please&#8221; well they did as they pleased and destroyed the white race our culture and the country we had in the process.</p>
<p>The only hope native Euro-Americans now have is to grab whatever they have left and hold it by reclaiming the lost values of our forefathers.</p>
<p>Why is Russia the last remaining bastion of white racial intergrity? Feminism has not ravaged it yet. Until we defeat this beast we cannot support our race in the manner we have grown used to or even save it from being overwhelmed.</p>

		<p>The only good that may come from amnesty is that it will likely increase participation in the growing white movement and could well assure that it continues on in a more militant form.</p>
<p>But, with or without amnesty we&rsquo;re on the road to break up.  And with or without an economic collapse we&rsquo;re still heading for fragmentation and conflict, however, I&rsquo;d be truly amazed if the financial foundation didn&rsquo;t deteriorate to great depression levels in the next two or three years.</p>
<p>Not a very rosy picture indeed.  Welcome to North Mexico.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to be optimistic here. I don&rsquo;t think Obama will try for this insane push for amnesty. Look how upset people are over healthcare reform. If he dares try to push amnesty through, it will push the American people right over the edge and there is no telling what will happen in this Country. It would also be political suicide for him. While I know he doesn&rsquo;t give two cents for what the majority of Americans want, HE wants a second trem and this will kill it for him.</p>

		<p>So will we White Americans take to the street and march on Washington?  </p>
<p>If we do not stop this and demand deportation and the seal of the border once and for all, then Whitey just as well lay down and die. This will be the end of America and if we do not stop the legal immigration and refugees from the 3rd world it is the end of White America forever.  So when do we start? </p>

		<p>Understanding B. Hussein Obama  and his motives is actually pretty simple. He is merely following the teachings of his spiritual advisor rev. Wright &#8220;G  &mdash;  D  &mdash;  - America&#8221;.</p>

Margaret- Reagan later admitted the amnesty was a mistake and he regretted it.</p>

		<p>Is the Washington Times a major paper with a wide circulation?  Is it perhaps something that the GOP reads to find out what they should thinking, like The New Republic is for liberals?  Is it within the &#8220;mainstream&#8221;, or is it a taboo to be seen reading it?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering because this is a near declaration of war.  The Democrats are the enemies of America and know they are.  The GOP, the &#8220;Stupid Party&#8221;, doesn&rsquo;t know, doesn&rsquo;t care, or is  secretly on the other side.  This article is a pretty in-your-face accusation of treason.  Is this paper influential, or just another birdcage liner?  </p>
<p>Voltaire said that understanding politics is like staying over at someone&rsquo;s house and waking in the middle of the night to hear a pair of wooden clogs going up the stairs followed by a pair of silk slippers going down, and then trying to guess what is going on.  We posters here are scattered individuals.  AmRen, online and in print, has been read by a only very small fraction of the number of people  who watch the miscegenation on Gray&rsquo;s Anatomy every week.  Powerful interests, who see us as pawns, are tearing the nation apart, and we can only watch and try to guess what will happen next.  </p>
<p>So, is this article, and the White unrest shown at tea parties, Presidential addresses, and gun shows, the prelude to a larger struggle?  The Left, both in its old communist form and its new liberal form, has committed so long a list of crimes that any compromise is impossible.  Their actions are utterly indefensible.  (Wouldn&rsquo;t we all love to see these Senators plunked down in front of a TV camera and forced to explain themselves?)  Are there larger forces at work that have allowed people all the freedom they need to show their true colors, so that they may be easily culled?  Is there really a Great Right Wing Conspiracy, or is it just us?  </p>

		<p>The reporter does a good job of summarizing the problem. What&rsquo;s missing is his advice for what people should do if the problem is not resolved. Rational people should take precautions as best they can. How about promoting a white identity, supporting white organizations, and doing white things with white people? A strong white ethnic group will help whites weather the coming storm. </p>

		<p>An interesting exercise would be to gather together the statements by Ronald Reagan about his amnesty. Then ask today&rsquo;s amnesty promoters to explain why they haven&rsquo;t enforced his promise to stop illegal immigration. The irony of asking Obama to do so would be rich given all the fuss about calling him a liar. Obama&rsquo;s never done anything to enforce Reagan&rsquo;s promise to stop illegal immigration thus making a liar out of Reagan. </p>

<p>This is far too kind and shows a misunderstanding. These people are not just in it for power and glory, even though they revel in that. They truly hate us as a people and they would be happy to implement something that destroyed the white nation even if they were kicked from power. They know they will retire with wealth and the neverending love of their white-hating friends. This goes the same for the white leaders like ted kennedy. They have a self-loathing that could only be explained by a team of psychiatrists</p>

		<p>I strongly suspect that when the push for amnesty comes there will be no strong centralized opposition to it as is evident with the health plan&hellip;<br>
That&rsquo;s because the insurance companies and their astro-turf organizations will not be pouring $ and support to the anti-immigration effort.  <br>
They will welcome it, big business will support amnesty, and then Mr. and Mrs. Tea Party will see just how much their opinion is worth.</p>

		<p>The last Amnesty push in 2006 and 2007 was defeated, in large part to the millions of faxes and phone calls sent by members of Numbersusa.com Please think about joining. There is no cost to send a fax or to join their million other mebers, only a cost if you don&rsquo;t join and help and lose your country through inaction<br>

You can also help by making youtube videos about immigration and by calling and writing media reporters. <br>
here is one youtube video on immigration made in an hour by a friend with no camera needed.</p>

<p>For $29 you can buy a Magic Jack and hook up yo your computer and call anywhere in the usa for free on your computer, Start calling and make your voice heard.</p>
<p>Do you get sick to your stomach watching or listening to  immigration stories on Public TV and radio that treat immigration conservatives as racist. Write them a letter and explain your side, when it comes time to have their station license renewed show up in the public hearings.</p>
<p>Join local groups and take local action. Do you know if anyone has asked if your County or City is using everify for their workers, Why not? Speak out aginst boycotts of Lou Dobbs and Glenn Beck. When a writer calls Pat Buchanan a Hate speech writer call them out on it, defend the few in the media that are on our side.<br>
Do not think you have no powwer or are alone. The country is on our side, the b=cheap labor lobby and globalists,churches and ethnic advocates and academic and media elites and even environmentalists are against us. But we outnumber them.For 40 years most Americans have wanted less immigration and Zero illegal immigration and we have been betrayed by our leaders time after time.<br>

		<p>Why does the media stick with that &#8220;12 million&#8221; number?  They&rsquo;ve been using it for at least 10 years.  I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve had more than a few additional illegal immigrants since then.</p>
<p>It will be necessary for everyone against this amnesty to repeatedly call their congresscritters and voice opposition to any amnesty.  Democrats have a majority in both houses (you can thank the neocons for that) and nearly every Democrat favors illegal immigration.  This will be the fight of our lives.  Remember, Democrats don&rsquo;t care about preserving American jobs for Americans, even in a deep recession.  They don&rsquo;t care about protecting the environment by stabilizing our population.  They do care about adding 15 million Democrats to the voter rolls, and they know which way the amnestied illegals will vote.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine that amnesty could pass given the current unemployment figures.  If the economy remains in the toilet (which I believe it will), Obama will have a difficult time passing any of his marxist agenda.</p>
<p>However, by even broaching the subject of amnesty in this economic climate Obama is sending a clear message to the white middle class:  My objective is to displace you. </p>

		<p>When this amnesty issue gets to the head of the line after the dust settles on Obamacare, it should prove to be extremely interesting. Big mystery where the Republicans will take a stand on this critical issue. Of course they want the Hispanic vote, but they also have America&rsquo;s conservatives to answer to. Let us all hope and pray that a million sick and fed up Americans descend on Washington to protest in even greater numbers than the last big demo. That would be too hard for the MSM to ignore. And everybody plueeeeeeez, be sure to email, fax, send a letter to your elected representatives and tell everybody you know to do the same. The last go-round sponsored by those traitors McCain and Kennedy went belly up due to popular outrage; we can do it again. Of course we must all be ever watchful of those lying deceitful snakes in Washington who will try any way they can think of to bamboozle us and sneak this atrocious legislation past unsuspecting, disinterested Americans. This might be our finest hour to send the tyrants packing down the road with their tails between their legs. Expect the usual cries of racism.</p>

<p>That said, it&rsquo;s always been interesting to note that the only countries which have &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; forced upon them are majority-white nations.  Not a single Asian, African, Latin country EVER.  Not even Japan, which example gives the lie to those who claim it&rsquo;s an economic matter.  </p>
<p>Our overlords practice &#8220;divide and conquer&#8221; because only majority-white nations scare them, or have ever managed to act effectively against them. <br>

		<p>12 million? They&rsquo;ve been throwing out this phony number for more than fifteen years. The number is easily more than 25 million and possibly close to 40 million. Then consider the endless chain migration. If the football fanatics and American Idol watchers don&rsquo;t shake off their apathetic stupor and shake it off quickly, the USA as generations have known and loved it, is TOAST. Prepare to talk your ignorant neighbors, friends, and family members into making phone calls and firing off emails to the nitwits in Congress.</p>

		<p>The best thing we can do to make passage of amnesty virtually impossible it to defeat the current push for socialized medicine. That would take a lot of wind out of obama&rsquo;s sails and make him realize that his radical agenda isn&rsquo;t gonna pass, even with his own party in control because the opposition to it is so intense. The article says amnesty would be the death knell of traditional America, and that&rsquo;s the truth, it would mark the beginiging of the U*S as a third world country. The outragous thing is that&rsquo;s what Bush was obsessed with doing from the moment he took office, and he supposedly was a &#8220;conservative Republican&#8221; (according to the MSM) and not a &#8220;radical socialist&#8221; like  OBAMA. </p>

		<p>&#8220;(Feminism)it has also killed marriage and has decimated the original population of America. We gave the country away when we allowed so many women to &ldquo;do as they please&rdquo; well they did as they pleased and destroyed the white race our culture and the country we had in the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is nonsense. If you look at marriage, it&rsquo;s the men today that are &#8220;afraid to commit.&#8221; It&rsquo;s the women more than the men that want kids and birth control ie. the Pill, which most men want their women to use, is what is preventing births. Anyway, there is no shortage of White workers, only a shortage of White slave labor, which Big Business wants. It&rsquo;s males that created marxism ie. Marx and Lennon, it&rsquo;s majority males in Congress and in Big Business that want all these illegals for votes and cheap labor. As far as doing what they please, women have as much right as men to do as they please. Stop blaming the opposite sex when both are equally responsible. It only divides.<br>

<p> &#8220;It takes 9 paid workers to support 1 retired person without raising medicare and Social Security rates and even that 9 to 1 ratio gives an overall loss. Within the next 3 years with the first of the baby boomer generation retirement, we will be down to 7 workers for every retired person. Within 15 years we will be down to 3 workers. They are hoping the illegals will fill this gap plain and simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that the illegals cost more in taxpayer social services such as food stamps, government housing, special education jails and prisons etc than they pay in taxes.  </p>
<p>That is; if they pay taxes.  Many pay no taxes and their employers don&rsquo;t pay into social security, unemployment, workmen&rsquo;s comp for them.  If they get a paycheck instead of cash, they simply claim 10 dependents and pay no taxes until they earn about $25,000 per year.</p>
<p>Immigrant business people don&rsquo;t pay taxes until the IRS impounds their bank accounts which seldom happens because the immigrant business people hide their money and other assets. </p>
<p>For instance an immigrant business if often owned by a relative in another state.  The real owner who runs the business is called an employee.  Both the real owner and the out of state owner of record might very well be using false Identification.</p>
<p>So the immigrants are a net loss as far as taxes go. With their low wages and non payment of taxes, they will not be able to support the retired baby boomers.</p>
<p>The government wants the baby boomers to die off as quickly as possible to further reduce the White percentage of the population. A non tax paying working class and non taxpaying immigrant small business class will help this genocide along because there really will be no money to keep the White baby boomers alive.  So they will die at 70 due to lack of medical care.</p>
<p>Any of you Southern Heritage people on this website know about the Golden Circle idea of the pre civil war Southern elite?<br>
The idea was that the south would secede from the United States and conquer Mexico, Central American and the Caribbean.  </p>
<p>A new country would be formed.  The capital would be Havanna.  Chattel slavery would be instituted for the Latin American Indians, a vast labor supply.  White N. European Protestant Americans would be the rulers of this new country.  All the Spanish Catholic Latin American and Caribbean elites would go along with this.I don&rsquo;t know what the Golden Circle theorists thought the European states would do when Americans decided to annex their Caribbean colonies.</p>
<p>The new country would be incredibly wealthy by raising tobacco, sugar, rice, coffee and cotton. A sort of agricultural Kuwait</p>
<p>I think the 20th century elites are determined to create a new Golden Circle.  Only instead of bothering to conquer those latin American and Caribbean countries, they will just import the entire cheap labor, low IQ, easily manipulated population of those countries to American.</p>
<p>The process started in 1965 with the Immigration Act.  It has been very successful.</p>
<p>As someone wrote last week, we are like Doctors who can diagnose and write a successful treatment plan but have no equipment or medicine to carry out the treatment plan.</p>

<p>It simply rewards criminal behavior. Rewards criminals who were supported for years by our tax moneys   &mdash;   with free healthcare, even welfare supplements (fraudulently obtained). Rewards criminals who pushed our own working poor Black and White Americans aside with complete indifference, by their willingness to work for lower wages, secure in the knowledge they can and will get those welfare supplements, free healthcare and free educational benefits.</p>
<p>Instead of rewarding these criminal illegal aliens, utilize all of our national resources, DRIVE THEM BACK ACROSS THE BORDER! COST WHAT IT MAY!</p>

		<p>Delmar Jackson, you are so right about the trends but hiding and whining by most people will not reverse them.  I put my name to all letters on the same subjects in Europe (I am retired in Spain) and often they are printed in national and local newspapers.  It is the only way to change the many &#8220;undecided&#8221; voters around us all.  Anyone who feels strongly about the status quo going the way it is must stand up fearlessly and object rationally, strongly and very often.  So the advice about flooding the racist organisations (for that is what they are) with mail and phone calls is excllnet for that is what they do.  We are not racists, we are realists.  So get the pens and keyboards out now.  Be strong and keep the USA as the best country in the world.  Your fore-fathers worked hard and even died to make it so.  Do not throw it all away  As someone who was in the British military and have the medals to show, so I will not let these Marxist-leaning politicians (most of whom have never fought for their country, only undeserved political power, ruin it all for my descendants.</p>

<p>&gt; No one but hordes of Chinese, who are the best scavengers in the world.  No one but Russians, who could just hop a short distance into former governor Palin&rsquo;s front yard!</p>
<p>Russian professors have predicted it, our mismanagement of America seems to prove it; the US will begin to divide and loose central control of itself.  Some old Confederates think this is great, but they are lost in retrospective dreaming; this is not the 19th century.</p>
<p>What is coming?  It is difficult to say.  But with some of the outrageous moves the Mr. Obama is making and his appointments and policies, it does seem that he is forcing either contrition by whites into oblivion or is providing the explosive elements for a revolution.  However, this has to be some ways off.  History shows that people have to be starving and much more provoked than white America is right now, before they act as a mass.  It is more likely that we will be dealing with a long series of losing legal battles as we fight on the job discrimination, and the various applicable aspects of race replacement like this probable amnesty ruling.  Just remember, even if he doesn&rsquo;t do it, the illegals will remain.  And even if they are not allowed into the new health care system, they will still show up at the ER and cost even more money.<br>

<p></p>
<p>Women are the ones who have the ONLY say in the approximatly 1.5 million yearly abortions. Men have been excluded from any say since Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>And men stay away from marriage because it has become nothing but a trap with men having zero legal rights. The same with false rape, domestic violence etc. Feminist groups put their power behind all minority legislation and have stood strong with blacks and hispanics to cripple and punish white men as well. Not an opinion but a fact look at the legislation NOW has pushed from day one.</p>
<p>In fact funding these very programs is another reason the government welcomes these illegals. Sure they do not produce near as well as a white work force but when you actually look at the numbers of workers that will be leaving the work force in the next 20 years it is obvious the government is very worried.</p>
<p>Go blame it on whatever else you like but the bottom line is that the white race has not kept up it&rsquo;s numbers of births and will continue to decline unless something is done. It should be obvious that marriage and births declined as feminism reared its ugly head. Luckily there is a growing number of white men and women who are seeing it for what it is.</p>

		<p> &#8220;America is an outgrowth of Christianity and English civilization./ The Founding Fathers were neither democrats nor believers in egalitarianism.&#8221;</p>
<p>These statements are problematic.  A deeper investigation rather demonstrates that they most certainly were democrats, believing themselves to be the new Greeks and that they were not given to fundamentalist Christianity. English history contains as its most important factor, the modern rise of democracy and its principles since the time of the Magna Carta. The Founding Fathers were influenced by what is historically termed, The Age of Reason when men&rsquo;s were rising up from Christian dogmatic oppressions and superstitions to use rational logic in forming their personal lives and dominions.  Most, like Washington were Deists, who were non-demoninational.  Washington himself ceased attending church altogether when the minister chided him for showing up late.  They were clearly against the dictatorship of religion or its tendancy to seek to influence the state.  Yet, the drive by religious zealots to do these things has not ceased since the time of the earliest colonies to the time they became states of a union in America.  This is history that may be easily traced.  As for not egalitarian, that is a big problem, since it is in the first lines of the Declaration of Independence. </p>

<p>I knew all along that the accusations of the tea parties being astroturfers were bunk.  In fact, there is a psychological phenomenon, it&rsquo;s either called projection or transferrance.  Whatever its name, it means that you see in other people the qualities you know you have in yourself, even if those qualities are only a very minor part of the other person or thing.  For Congressional Democrats and MSM talking heads to accuse &#8220;tea parties&#8221; of being part of an astroturf scheme only shows what the left is   &mdash;   a bunch of George Soros astroturfers.</p>
<p>However, I didn&rsquo;t know how to answer the accusations well until Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s column of a month or so ago.  The kind of people who would (in theory, but not in reality) put up opposition to ObamaCare reside on K Street in D.C.  K Street lobbyists don&rsquo;t waste time paying people to yell at politicians when they can buy/bribe politicians directly.  Ipso facto, tea parties aren&rsquo;t astroturf outfits.</p>

     But maybe it won&rsquo;t be Whites who first act as a mass.  The non-Whites have been taught that it is they who are aggrieved, that it is Whites who do all the provoking.  It may be that Whites will be second to act as a mass, forced to do so in retaliation for the mass actions of the ungrateful newcomers.  We see BHOs actions as attacks on us, bus his people see our objections as attacks on them.  There are more than two variables here, more players than just Whites versus the current administration.</p>
