<h1>
							Don&rsquo;t Be Afraid of the Black Girl: Serena Williams
						</h1>

						<p style="font-size: smaller">
							<i>Jasmyne A. Cannick, New American Media, September 13, 2009</i>
						</p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>
							What happened Saturday during the women&rsquo;s semifinals at the U.S. Open between Serena Williams and Kim Clijsters is just another example of how black women are still seen as threatening and hostile.
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip} From day one, the Williams sisters have had to fight for everything they&rsquo;ve accomplished in tennis, including the continuing racism that keeps the Williams sisters from the Palm Springs Indian Wells Tournament and allows for commentators to credit the sisters&rsquo; &#8220;strength&#8221; and &#8220;athleticism&#8221; for their victories while their white counterparts win because they &#8220;play smart&#8221; and &#8220;strategize.&#8221; It&rsquo;s also the reason that my hometown paper, the Los Angeles Times, can feel confident in reporting this latest news while using a photo of Serena Williams from the back, seemingly towering over the lineswoman, and giving license to every other news outlet to have a field day.
						</p>
						<p>
							In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago that Serena Williams wrote on her blog about an incident at the German Open where she lost to Dinara Safina. She wrote that she could hear the entire players&rsquo; lounge &#8220;all happy and joyous&#8221; because she had finally lost:
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							What ensued Saturday was nothing more than a few angry curse words that lead [sic] Serena to have to defend herself against unmade threats toward the lineswoman who was obviously suffering from a typical case of afraid-of-the-black-girl syndrome. How else do you explain the lineswoman&rsquo;s alleged accusations that Serena was threatening to kill her?
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							Most black women can relate to what happened to Serena. We get mad like everyone else. The only difference is that for some reason, when white women get angry, they&rsquo;re not perceived to be as threatening as we are. Maybe it&rsquo;s the expression on our face. Maybe it&rsquo;s the seriousness with which we address issues when we are upset. Maybe it&rsquo;s the tone of our voice. You know that &#8220;Don&rsquo;t f &mdash; with me today&#8221; tone that can stop a person dead in their tracks and scares the s &mdash; t out of most white people.
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							I&rsquo;ve said nothing more than &#8220;good morning&#8221; to a white person and had that taken the wrong way. Maybe I didn&rsquo;t smile big enough when I said it, I don&rsquo;t know. What I do know is that I can count the many times I have had to explain something I did or said that someone took out of context or found &#8220;troubling.&#8221; {snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip} come Monday morning, from Rush Limbaugh to Los Angeles&rsquo; shock jock Bill Handel, that&rsquo;s exactly what is going to happen. And once again, black women are going find themselves the brunt of crude and tasteless jokes meant to further demean and dehumanize Serena Williams and all black women.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just ask former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney about her run-in with the Capitol Hill police. Or better yet, ask First Lady Michelle Obama, who endured months of ridicule and scrutiny at the hands of the mainstream media that eventually resulted in an immediate campaign to &#8220;change&#8221; her image to a much kinder and gentler Michelle right before the election that catapulted her husband into the presidency. {snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip} Perhaps when more black women tennis players ascend to the level of the Williams sisters and the Women&rsquo;s Tennis Association has the opportunity to interact with more black women besides Serena and Venus, they won&rsquo;t be so afraid of the black girls. Perhaps.<br />

								What to derive from this statement? That even if a black person approaches in a threatening manner and hurling insults all the while that it&rsquo;s just a matter of one&rsquo;s own &#8220;racist&#8221; perceptions?
							</p>

								This is the madness of political correctness and the Balkanization of multiculturalism. To those who submit, it leads to a neurotic state in which a steaming pile of excrement must be viewed as a bed of roses, lest the ultimate heresy occur. Your &#8220;racist&#8221; instincts are not to be trusted&hellip;even as the black fist smashes you in the face.

								Ms. Cannick comes from a long line of White-hating Black women. What AmRen readers need to realize is that Black women are more anti-White than Black men. All I need to hear are the remarks against White men and women, especially White women.
							</p>
							<p>
								Serena&rsquo;s remarks were obscene and hateful and I&rsquo;m glad she got punished for them. If Don Imus got fired for making statements about Rutger&rsquo;s Basketball team, then Serena ought to be banned from playing tennis. It&rsquo;s only fair.

								Awww! Poor, put-upon black folks! Nobody never give them no respect! Guess that little ole Oriental judge shoulda knowed that Serena just be a funnin&rsquo;!
							</p>
							<p>
								Serena and Venus Williams have been fawned over and idolized by the mainstream news media ever since they entered professional tennis. Oh, lookit! Two big, beautiful black sisters, beatin&rsquo; the tar (excuse the pun) out of these racist White girls! Ain&rsquo;t it great?! The sports staffs were so glad to see tennis quit being so unforgivably White, they could hardly hide their glee.
							</p>
							<p>
								But incidents like this, which seem to crop up far too often where black celebrities are concerned, send the MSM scrambling to make excuses for their vaunted black idols. She was &#8220;stressed.&#8221; She never, EVER acted like this before (except in post-match press conferences). And, oh, did I mention that the system is totally rigged against the Williamses because they&rsquo;re black?
							</p>
							<p>
								Cry me a river, Serena. We&rsquo;ve all heard it before &mdash; over, and over, and over &hellip; And by the way, when those other players were all happy in the lounge because you had lost, did it ever occur to you that it was because we often like to see &#8220;the champ&#8221; get dethroned &mdash; whatever color he or she is?

								Sorry, but black girls have demonstrated too many times a willingness to use violence against someone they don&rsquo;t like, disagree with, perceive as a threat, etc. This is just more stupid unrealistic liberal advice, on how certain minorities should be treated, even when doing so might get you maimed or killed. Stay in your gated communities liberals, and shut up.

								Cannick has it backwards. The more people interact with black women, the more they see their aggressive, nasty and obnoxious attitude. I&rsquo;ve never had a problem with Venus Williams, it&rsquo;s Serena Williams that I&rsquo;ve never liked. Whether it&rsquo;s her outrageous outburts, the wild outfits or the huge bling bling she wears, she has always acted and looked like a ghetto mama. Her latest tirade does not suprise me in the least. Judging by her temper, size and muscle mass, I would be willing to bet my paycheck that she&rsquo;s on steroids.

								The writer hit this one point surprisingly square on the head. I recall reading in a back issue of American Renaissance that blacks&rsquo; complaints are taken much more seriously than they deserve by whites because blacks tend to wildly overreact to circumstances that would get a much milder reaction from whites.

								Black women aren&rsquo;t simply, &#8220;seen as threatening and hostile.&#8221; They ARE often threatening and hostile!! And since many Black females demonstrate a decidedly masculine appearance, it is likely all the more threatening to more naturally feminine White women.

								I have to say I am surprised at the very unflattering pix that are appearing of Serena. The press does not seem to be pulling any punches, then again her initial press conference was bad in and of itself, and they can&rsquo;t be expected to censor that:

								Be afraid; be VERY afraid. When first I heard about this incident, my mind flashed instantly, &#8220;What about John McEnroe?&#8221;
							</p>
							<p>
								Watching it though, this was something quite different from McEnroe&rsquo;s legendary fugues. Blacks threaten to kill people as easily as other people say &#8220;Please&#8221; and &#8220;Thank you&#8221;, and once in awhile a non-black takes them seriously. Then they end up in trouble just for what they threaten to do rather than for actually doing it.
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact, &#8220;I&rsquo;M GONNA KIIIIIILL YEEEEEW!!!&#8221; is probably the second most common exclamation in the black vernacular, topped only by the omnipresent &#8220;I&rsquo;M GONNA KICK YER A &mdash; !!!&#8221; I have little doubt that Williams said one or both of those things. Does this nit-wit author really expect civilized people everywhere to accept such an outburst as a manifestation of cultural differences?
							</p>
							<p>
								Far as I&rsquo;m concerned, no manners = no culture. There are civilized people, and there are blacks. Don&rsquo;t expect civilized people to accept black behavior and shrug off the endless threats to kill and maim others. All too often, the threats get carried out.

								Typically racist article by a typically racist black woman. No non-black player ever threatened to kill a line judge. Besides, both Williams sisters are over hyped simply because they are black. Kim Clijsters is simply a better player and that is why the black woman who wrote this article is so angry.<br />

								The youtube video of the incident clearly shows her approaching the mousey asian judge not once, but twice, brandishing her racket like some kind of war club, then putting on her pious &#8220;Who-ME?-but-I-dinna-say-nuffin!!!&#8221; victim victim facade as if the cameras didn&rsquo;t just catch the whole thing on tape for the world to see. Pompous, violent, and duplicitous, quite a peoples champion that Serena is.
							</p>
							<p>
								Oh and how did she smash a racket? The only tennis racket I ever owned was a wood one, but aren&rsquo;t they all like super strong composite materials these days? She must have really went to town to actually smash one. Do they test these &#8220;athletes&#8221; for steroids I wonder? She clearly seems to be exhibiting classic bouts of roid rage, and if you took away her long hair and bust, her physique would be just about as feminine as a certain African Sprinter&rsquo;s&hellip;<br />

								It must be a cultural difference between the races embedded in the genes. The white and Asian races do not usually communicate with such hostility and violent threats. Even this black writer is unable to perceive such behavior is unacceptable and then later even had the nerve to lie about her behavior during an interview. Blacks do not seen to understand that only by the grace of the white and Asian race that they are getting a free ride. One day this will end.

								More of the same from blacks. Whaa all the white people dont worship me. &#8220;Unmade threats&#8221;! Blacks think that grab ass and violent threats arent a big deal. Its their community. Its also why they are so feared. So when Jasmyne the writer hear is surprised it is no shock. In her community this is normal. To tell a referee that you will shove a ball down their throat if they make another mistaken call. That is an unmade threat? Tells us a lot about the writer. And she thinks that whites are over reacting. Thats why white and Asian people fear black women. They think such threats are every day lifes experience. As they say, just playin the game. Maybe this sort of boisterous angry reaction is why the black community is wildly violent. Maybe?

								I can summorize this article as &#8220;Angry black columnist excuses behavior of angry black athlete, blames white racism.&#8221;

							<p>
								Blacks love to intimidate people. This writer gloats about white people being &#8220;scared&#8221; of blacks while claiming racism if blacks indeed are seen a scary. Blacks love how they are seen as threatening to other races, it gives them a sense of power. Even educated and professional blacks fall back on this mindset of intimidation to get their way. This is the game they play, they foster an image of intimidation ie. angry black male/female then act as a victim of racism because whites don&rsquo;t &#8220;understand&#8221; them.

								It always amazes me how the black race can turn just about any negative situation in their own favor by victimizing themselves. Blacks are by far one of the most self-victimizing races on earth. This is no less true for black women.
							</p>
							<p>
								Is it truly &#8220;racism&#8221; when White women - who are NATURALLY more timid and passive - show fear at the sight of loud, often bellicose black women, who are usually of thicker build? The TRUE answer is no.

								&gt;Most black women can relate to what happened to Serena. We get mad like everyone else. The only difference is that for some reason, when white women get angry, they&rsquo;re not perceived to be as threatening as we are. Maybe it&rsquo;s the expression on our face. Maybe it&rsquo;s the seriousness with which we address issues when we &gt;are upset. Maybe it&rsquo;s the tone of our voice.
							</p>
							<p>
								This calls to mind how whenever a young white female goes missing, or appears to be the victim of foul play, like the Aruba case a few years back, or the young girl who was kidnapped in Utah, how black women will often complain that the media treats white females like they are more vulnerable, much like &#8220;damsels in distress&#8221;. They often seem quite bitter about it, and imply it is some how racist. I always found it to be a rather strange, and even perverse reaction, since they almost can sound jealous of women who may, or may not be found alive. But it occurs to me, if what they say is true about white females, perhaps the same is not true of black women, since they take so much pride in being &#8220;strong black women&#8221; Often times, they will brag about how intimidating others find them, including their own men.

								Just the other day we had the news story on Caster Semenya. Now, we have Serena Wiliams. It makes me wonder if this sort of extreme aggressiveness is a common thing among black women. I wonder if it&rsquo;s explained biologically (hormonally or genetically) or something like that.
							</p>
							<p>
								Yes, I know there are a lot of mouthy, in-your-face black women out there. They&rsquo;re quite common, in fact. But I&rsquo;m talking about those really exceptional ones who go even beyond the ordinary. One encounters them just occasionally.
							</p>
							<p>
								I can think of four of five that I have known, separately, over forty years of experience, in work situations, who were tough, assertive, masculine, and HYPER-aggressive. These several women were walking volcanoes and were trouble wherever they went. They had everyone afraid of them. (Even their neighbors called up to complain!) Management dreaded dealing with them. Even the high executives feared to face them and either pandered to them or avoided them in any way possible (hence these women always escaped being fired, since no one would authorize it or sign it). These women had no respect for anybody and wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to tell off, shout down, or threaten anyone &mdash; no matter who you were. They made it clear that they didn&rsquo;t care and titles meant nothing to them. These women always had to be right, always knew everything, were wiser than everyone else, questioned authority, challenged all the rules, they argued about anything and everything with anybody. And they always had to be &#8220;in charge&#8221; in any situation, even when they had no official authority at all (which they never did). They would bluster, threaten, argue, and bully everyone around them, black or white, and even get physical if necessary! (One even got into a fight with a police officer; after cross charges were made, it was dismissed.) They feared nobody. And ironically, since nobody (especially management) would face them head-on, they always got their way. They got away with this behavior for years, all the way to retirement! It was outrageous, and they made a specialty of engaging in it, knowing very well that very few white people (especially men) were able to deal with a mouthy, angry, in-your-face black woman. Most white men would do ANYTHING to avoid that. (And of course, these women knew they had the law and all the EEO apparatus on their side, and they didn&rsquo;t hesitate to play that card either. No managers or executives wanted to face a career-killing EEO complaint over some minor fuss.)
							</p>
							<p>
								I suspect that maybe one out of every 2 or 3 hundred black women may get this extra male chromosome, or whatever it is. Have others encountered this phenomenon too? I really wonder what causes it. I can&rsquo;t recall any white females who were anything like this. Yes, there are some pushy and mouthy white women too; they exist, and they can be difficult to deal with. But these black women were something on a higher order, another breed entirely.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mercifully, I am retired now, and don&rsquo;t have to face that anymore. Thank God!

								It never fails to amaze me how blacks will always excuse the bad conduct of another black. Race always comes first with blacks. Always. McEnroe sometimes behaved badly. But White sportswriters never condoned his behaviour.

								Nice posting, RetiredManager.
							</p>
							<p>
								Such women are a product of this nation&rsquo;s particular way of doing things. In a pre-affirmative action and pre-civil rights world &mdash; &#8220;on the STREEEEEETS!!!&#8221;, as blacks are fond of putting it &mdash; someone would likely have broken such women&rsquo;s jaws or disabled their tongues very early on, thus bringing their careers as professional nuisances to a quick, ignominious end.
							</p>
							<p>
								With the current social circumstances protecting and pandering to such people, however, they find a way to thrive. It&rsquo;s very hard to fire them, and they know it. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re so much tough as emboldened by circumstance.
							</p>
							<p>
								Though not a perfect analogy, it&rsquo;s something like the unique set of circumstances that allowed a pudgy, borderline homeless person full of hatred and resentment to rise to power in Germany 76 years ago and wreak havoc on the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								I don&rsquo;t think Serena Williams quite fits your model, though. Maybe just because she knew she&rsquo;d stepped over the line &mdash; in more ways than one &mdash; she maintained a modicum of self control when the judges came onto the court. The line judge didn&rsquo;t seem intimidated either, IMHO. She simply decided quickly that she didn&rsquo;t have to take any lip from Williams, complained to proper authority, and calmed da sista down real quick.
							</p>
							<p>
								Yeah, there are black women like you describe, but like most blacks they&rsquo;re basically cowardly. The men need 15 or 20 homies backing them up before they&rsquo;ll attack; aggressive black women prefer affirmative action and civil rights laws.

								People make remarks about the size of Serena Williams. They should google the stories about Pro Tennis considering drug testing. Serena Williams was front and center, loudly denouncing this. No one else really said much of anything. I can remember when this happened and specifically noticing how quiet most of the MSM was on this. Not that Serena is a doper mind you, but her shrill behavior didn&rsquo;t project the best impression.

								That was a good post. I agree with you. The simple truth is black women are NOT like other females (when was the last time you were intimidated by a Japanese or Korean women?). The obvious physicality of them, their clear unattractiveness etc. Then there is the social side - loud, crude and vulgar. They are very mannish. I always thought this was the way they are raised and just are from being in an black environment. Now I really think the matter is a genetic phenomenon. In fact I think genetics explains, or partly explains, just about everything about blacks. They ARE different.

								When I was living in NYC (white male late fifties) after standing in a post office line because there were none of the forms I needed atthe entrance the black woman at the barred window barely listened to my request for the form and screamed at me to get away from her window. After that I found a post office staffed by Asians to go to. Point to make: John Derbyshire in an aside in a series of random observations asked, &#8220;Why are there so many angry black women in New York?&#8221; Expected black behaviour it would seem!

								Your description of Black women in the workplace reminds me of many situations I have experienced, although not quite as extreme with many White women in the Northwest since living here in the past eight years. I came to term it, &#8220;The Tanya Harding Syndrome.&#8221;
							</p>
							<p>
								I think it is based in militant feminism and seperate cultures of bad manners and a lack of poise as women in general. This is coupled with a 30+ year history of bashing males, especially white males. Backed by AA and Protected Groups policies, they have become bold to the point that a man like me simply chooses retirement to the trouble of constant harassment that draws no sympathy from society or law.
							</p>
							<p>
								The entire system we have has to be torn completely down in order for a new beginning. Since we aren&rsquo;t likely to actually tear it down, this one has to be left to fail - and it is failing. This particular problem is not so blatant in Europe because they have much older cultures where the sexes have a past better grounded in chivalry.

								All black female workplaces are like this, a war zone. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are affirmative action welfare to work clerks, teachers, school administrators or attorneys. 10 percent black female is tolerable. 15 percent is bad. With only 20 percent black females, the place is a he!!hole of vicious gossip, outright lies, intrigue and constant squabbling.
							</p>
							<p>
								No matter how totally blatantly fantastic and false their accusations against co-workers are, HR has to investigate and hold hearings and sensitivity sessions if the accusation is made by a black.
							</p>
							<p>
								40 years ago when I passed my 1 year probationary period and was granted tenure the supervisor who evaluated me told me that 2 of my co-workers had made all sorts of accusations against me. She said she ignored them because they were always making things up about other workers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Those 2 women were black. The co workers they lied about were like myself all White. But within a few years of that conversation HR departments were forced to spend their time dealing with the vicious lies of disfunctional blacks.
							</p>
							<p>
								But the big companies that have been forced to hire the huge HR departments to deal with the disfunctional, squabbling blacks who do almost no work are the very companies that donate to ACLU, NAACP, ADL, $SPLC etc. The companies got what they wanted, a non White work force. Let them enjoy it.

								I have seen absolute ghetto black hospital clerks berate Asian and White physicians simply because the physician politely requested the black alleged female pull a patient&rsquo;s file for them.

								Yet those Watts and Compton ghetto black women talked to him the way Williams talked to the referee, or like they talk to their children, relatives and neighbors.
							</p>
							<p>
								And the supervisor just went into her office and shut the door.

								<b><i>&#8220;All black female workplaces are like this, a war zone. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are affirmative action welfare to work clerks, teachers, school administrators or attorneys. 10 percent black female is tolerable. 15 percent is bad. With only 20 percent black females, the place is a he!!hole of vicious gossip, outright lies, intrigue and constant squabbling.&#8221; </i></b><br />
								<br />
								Twenty percent sounds like heaven to me! My staff was about 85% black, and 13% Hispanic. Over the years, there were several white women who passed through, briefly, but didn&rsquo;t stay long. Several Hispanic young men who were students, but didn&rsquo;t stay. And one Oriental woman, extremely responsible and competent, who was quickly promoted and got out of there. The blacks just stayed on forever. When I left, there was only one white woman (an unusual case) who had been raised among blacks and was married to a black man. She was for all practical purposes black herself, and managed to get along with them.

								<i><b>&#8220;No matter how totally blatantly fantastic and false their accusations against co-workers are, HR has to investigate and hold hearings and sensitivity sessions if the accusation is made by a black.&#8221;</b></i>
							</p>
							<p>
								Indeed they do (have to investigate), but that&rsquo;s only when an official complaint is made. There are a hundred times more accusations and rumors that are never put on paper, just spread by mouth. Many were incredibly low and vicious.
							</p>
							<p>
								We had at least one unusual complaint that was black vs. black. One of these hyper-agressive women, new and with no seniority, was placed in the Payroll Office which she immediately proceeded to take over and &#8220;manage&#8221;, bossing everyone else, even brushing aside the supervisor (the whole office was black, btw). The place was nearing war. She refused to accept anyone&rsquo;s authority, least of all the supervisor&rsquo;s, who was much lighter-skinned than she was. One day they all got into a conversation about shadings of skin color, as blacks like to do. This woman, who was very dark, darker than all the others, told the rest of them that: &#8220;Your skin looks like sh &mdash; t.&#8221; [a quote] At that point the entire payroll staff came marching into the executive office, refusing to work in that room with her any longer. It was her or them. There was an EEO complaint filed, (as required in such a case, being a racial insult). If a white had made that insult, he/she would probably have been fired. But the outcome was that she was banished from that office and simply transferred downstairs to another. None of her behavior changed. She actually benefited from the transfer because she then muscled an elderly white woman out of a desirable position which was a higher one than she was qualified for, and the older woman chose simply to retire rather than make a fuss. This woman was at least 6 ft. and muscular. Nobody messed with her! There was nothing I could do either because my own boss was terrified of her, and he would take her side not mine. He would do ANYTHING to avoid her. On one occasion, he even went out sick in order to avoid facing her! If he did have to face her, he would agree with anything she said. He even allowed her to muscle out the elderly woman and have that job!
							</p>
							<p>
								I&rsquo;m telling you, this was not Susan B. Anthony! Break her jaw? I&rsquo;d be sorry for any man who tried to break her jaw. He&rsquo;d come out much the worse for it.
							</p>
							<p>
								<br />
								<i><b>&#8220;Even the high executives feared to face them and either pandered to them or avoided them in any way possible (hence these women always escaped being fired, since no one would authorize it or sign it). &#8220;</b></i>
							</p>
							<p>
								Another young black woman (not a hyper-aggressive) was a junkie and a scatterbrained ditz who showed up for work only when she felt like it. When she came to work, she mostly socialized and flirted. And ate constantly. She was very overweight. She was also an epileptic, which provided an excuse that covered a lot of unexplained absences and disappearances. When asked where she had been, she would simply claim that she didn&rsquo;t know. She was totally impossible and useless &mdash; although not a violent or evil troublemaker like some others. Then she got pregnant (by somebody there, unknown). One of the supervisors, a white female, after having a personal confrontation with her, resolved to get rid of her and began gathering documentation for dismissal.
							</p>
							<p>
								Personnel called that supervisor and asked her to write a report recommending what should be done. That supervisor told them, &#8220;You want me to send you a written report? Do you think I&rsquo;m crazy? I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think, over the phone, and off the record. But NO WAY am I going to put my recommendation on paper and sign my name to it! Here&rsquo;s a <b> &#8216;black&rsquo; </b>employee, <b>&#8216;female&rsquo;</b>, <b> &#8216;handicapped&rsquo;</b>, and <b>&#8216;pregnant&rsquo;</b>. And I&rsquo;m trying to get this poor child fired? If the newspapers got hold of this, they&rsquo;d have a feast! They&rsquo;d make me into the worst monster since Hitler. No way am I putting MY name on anything like that!&#8221;
							</p>
							<p>
								She was not fired, but left to have her baby. Then she was transferred to another location. I heard that a couple of years later she was fired. I don&rsquo;t know what she did, but you have to be really terrible to get fired. Most people couldn&rsquo;t if they tried.<br />

							</p>
							<p>
								Thinking about that, that was an especially interesting case, because it shows what a lone white person must do, when raised or working among blacks, in order to survive.
							</p>
							<p>
								I must say btw, that this was an intelligent and good-looking woman! She was very competent and became the backbone of the Payroll Office. She was one of the few who kept the place functioning. And she had a lot of social sense too: so fortunately for her, she could handle any situation. Hers must have been a difficult one.
							</p>
							<p>
								Her father had been a high executive somewhere (I&rsquo;ll not say where). But her parents split up when she was tiny and her mother (whom she described herself as &#8220;crazy&#8221;) ran off with a black man. Thus, she was raised among blacks and had no contact with her father&rsquo;s family. She told me she never met her real father until she was about 30! (But she obviously inherited her looks and intelligence from her father&rsquo;s side.)
							</p>
							<p>
								While still a teenager, she married a vary dark man and had half a dozen black children, who often dropped in to see her. She ate &#8220;black&#8221; food, listened to &#8220;black&#8221; music, talked ebonic speech, and completely fit in with the black group. Essentially, she had given up being white and become black. I once heard her say to them that since she had been raised among blacks and lived among them all her life, white men didn&rsquo;t look &#8220;normal&#8221; to her and she did not find them attractive. Although some of the other women, at first, were resentful of her, as I said she had excellent social skills and they came around. In time, they seemed to forget that she was white and accepted her as one of their own.
