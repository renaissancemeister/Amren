<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>All inmates booked into jails throughout Los Angeles County will have their immigration status checked beginning today, but federal officials said they don&rsquo;t have the resources to deport all illegal immigrants with criminal records who are identified.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement will prioritize illegal immigrants with prior convictions for violent crimes, including murder, rape, kidnapping and robbery. Though immigration officials plan to assess every case individually, they said some with less serious criminal records may be released back into the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality of the situation is that we don&rsquo;t presently have the resources to respond to every single person,&#8221; agency head John Morton said during a recent visit to Los Angeles. &#8220;We are focusing on the worst of the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Secure Communities program began last fall and is now in nearly 80 counties, including Ventura and San Diego. The government plans to have it up and running in all jails and prisons by the end of 2013. The program is part of the administration&rsquo;s focus on targeting illegal immigrants who have criminal records.</p>
<p>Nationwide, about 12% of all inmates checked were here illegally and had prior criminal convictions. Of those, about 6,700 had been convicted of violent crimes. Another roughly 60,000 had other criminal convictions.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles County, more than 40 law enforcement agencies will run inmates&rsquo; fingerprints through federal databases during the booking process to see if the inmates have had any contact with the immigration system.</p>
<p>Immigration officials will then determine the inmates&rsquo; immigration status, check the criminal record and place holds on those with a prior conviction of a serious crime.</p>
<p>Once those inmates finish serving their time, they will be transferred to immigration custody for possible deportation.</p>
<p>If inmates have been previously deported or have outstanding orders, they also will be subject to removal, said Trey Lund, field office director of detention and removal operations for ICE in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration officials said that the new screening process avoids concerns about racial profiling because every inmates&rsquo; fingerprints are checked.</p>

		<p>It will never happen.  Read this book:</p>
<p> The Deporter: One Agent&rsquo;s Struggle Against the U.S. Government&rsquo;s Refusal to Expel Criminal Aliens by Ames Holbrook (Hardcover - Oct 4, 2007) Amazon, Borders, Crown etc, but probably not in public libraries because most librarians are brainwashed, criminal loving,  marxist feminazis.</p>
<p>After a felon is released from prison, ICE has only 6 months to deport him.  The potential deportees are removed from state prison and housed in city jails in cities where there are immigration Judges. </p>
<p>He cannot just be taken from prison and sent to his home country.  ICE must take him before an immigration Judge for a deportation order.  If, by a miracle a deportation order is granted, his attorney can appeal. If he is still in the country 6 months after his first hearing, he must, by federal law, be allowed to stay in this country.</p>
<p>Appeal after appeal is granted. If he is still in the country when the deadline is reached he gets to stay.  Every church group, ADL, AJC, LARAZA ACLU tax payer funded immigrant rights group appeals endlessly to keep the felon until past the 6 months deadline. </p>
<p>If a deportation order is made, ICE must work with the local consulate of the felons country.  Much of the time his native country will refuse to take him back.  If and when there is a deportation order and his country consents to take him back, there is the physical problem of deportation.</p>
<p>The date of the departure must be kept secret.  The relatives, friends and immigration rights advocates, especially the church groups will swarm the airport departure lounge and scream, wail, roll on the floor and carry on like banshees until the plane departs without the deportee.</p>
<p>They are often released because of the screeching. The plane departs on time while the deportee is still at the airport with hysterical relatives clinging to him and the ICE deportation agents.</p>
<p>Airlines can refuse to take passengers who are screaming and carrying on.  The ACLU has obtained FEDERAL COURT ORDERS that deportees cannot be sedated or handcuffed.</p>
<p>Once the 6 month deadline is passed, ICE must remove the felon from the city prison and release him.</p>
<p>Mr. Holbrook says a large number of potential deportees are processed in the federal court located in New Orleans.  This is because the Louisianna jails charges to ICE for housing the potential deportees is much lower than in the north east, midwest etc.  Louisianna jails are the cheapest in the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Holbrook attributes much of the high crime rate in New Orleans to the huge number of felonious deportees who are brought to Louisianna by ICE and released on the streets of New Orleans by immigration Judges. The sob sisters of the church groups bear much of the blame for the high crime rate, along with the ADL ACLU LARAZA etc lawyers.<br>

		<p>Naw, we can&rsquo;t afford to deport them. But we sure can afford to house, medicate, feed and clothe them all can&rsquo;t we? That&rsquo;s not even counting all their family members. What the heck, let them out so they can commit even more crimes and make thousands more American victims.</p>

		<p>There is simply no reason to house illegal aliens in our prison systems. No reason whatsoever.</p>
<p>Put all of them on a military hop and drop them off in their country of origin.</p>
<p>Or since Obama and his ilk love the illegals so much, let&rsquo;s move all of them to DC. Maybe they can ride on Airforce One.</p>
