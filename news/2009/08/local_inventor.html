<h1><a href="https://www.leadercall.com/local/local_story_232111123.html">Local Inventor Files Lawsuit Against &#8216;Racist&rsquo; AOL, Google</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eloria Newell James, Leader-Call (Laurel, Mississippi), August 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Jones County inventor has filed a lawsuit against two Internet server companies.</p>
<p>John Ishmel Henry of Soso, in May, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi.</p>
<p>In his suit, Henry claims that &#8220;he was called and depicted as a n  &mdash;    &mdash;  r on two of the Internet service provider search engines, AOL and Google.&#8221;</p>
<p>Henry, the original inventor of the vibrating toilet seat, was featured on the Jay Leno Show in November, 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The hypocrisy of this libelous and slanderous tragedy has caused me enormous mental harm, emotional suffering and sleepless nights,&#8221; he claims in his suit. &#8220;I am a true American and feel that I have the right to respond to such indignation in the court of law.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I believe in the freedom of speech, but I believe we all should be treated fair as citizens of America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Henry said he is concerned as to how these search engines affects him as well as others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Henry said, he has suffered harm from the actions of the web sites and search engines.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Internet racism and it&rsquo;s something that affects the moral character of the American people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s time that we work on racism in our country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In July, Google and AOL filed motions in federal court requesting that the judge dismiss Henry&rsquo;s suit.</p>
<p>Henry is also working on a book titled &#8220;Diversity and Racism: The Challenge of Mankind.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;All Americans have been affected by racism and its horrible practices,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Many need counseling to some degree.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Wow, what an invention, how did we ever get along without that till now? Damn without these &#8220;N-words&#8221; and their revelatons we certainly would be in a world of choas, no wonder why we celebrate &#8220;Black History Month&#8221; hats off to Mr. Henry, keep up the good work.</p>

		<p>And I bet he was called the n-word.  He probably wrote those posts himself.</p>
<p>Using his logic, then www.ourspace.com should be shut down, because black assaults against whites have been organized there.</p>
<p>As for his book, I expect Tim Wise and Mark Potok to promote it and its one readable paragraph in 200 pages, and promote it heavily.</p>

		<p>He is right. We should work on racism in this country. I don&rsquo;t think he would like the kind I feel needs to be worked on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he stands much of a chance. If he had gone after the persons posting the information, he may have gotten more sympathy.</p>
<p>I just wonder if the search engines will cave?</p>

		<p>I want to apologize to the black community for previously posting that they had never invented anything of signifigance; I was unaware of the vibrating toilet seat.</p>
<p>BTW if you read Mr. Henry&rsquo;s comments in the original article he tries to use big words and ends up sounding like Amos n&rsquo; Andy.</p>

		<p>Not explained but certainly germaine&hellip; UNLESS you use the search engine(s) to specifically search the &#8220;n  &mdash;    &mdash;  r&#8221; word IN CONTEXT with the guy&rsquo;s name, how can the search engine be blamed? Aside from the fact most Americans never heard of this pathetic whiner, nor even if they did, could be bothered to search for that word in context with his name.</p>
<p>This sounds more like another extortion attempt by a Black seeking to &#8220;get rich quick&#8221; than a legitimate gripe. As to that infamous &#8220;n-word&#8221;, I have a copies of Tom Saw and Huckleberry Finn books going back to when my father was a child&hellip; Maybe Blacks would like to see legislation passed, making it a FEDERAL CRIME to possess literature containing the N-word. To which I can only say, GOOD LUCK! That word will NEVER be forgotten or drop out of common, if private, usage!</p>
