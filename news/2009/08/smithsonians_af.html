<h1>Smithsonian&rsquo;s African-American Museum to Display Emmett Till Casket</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Lee, Chicago Tribune, August 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The casket that held the mutilated body of civil rights martyr Emmett Till for 50 years will go on public display in the nation&rsquo;s newest African-American history museum, officials said.</p>
<p>The move comes a month after the casket was found discarded at Burr Oak Cemetery near Alsip.</p>
<p>Officials with the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s National Museum of African American History and Culture are expected to announce the casket&rsquo;s donation just before a memorial ceremony Friday to commemorate 54 years since Till&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are both honored and humbled that the Till family has entrusted this sacred object to the museum for preservation and safekeeping,&#8221; Bunch, former president of the Chicago History Museum, said in a news release.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The casket will be taken to Washington, the site of the new museum, where it will be evaluated by conservation experts and readied for display when the museum opens in late 2015, spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas said.</p>
<p>Till&rsquo;s body was originally buried in the casket with a glass top at his mother&rsquo;s request so that the public could see her son&rsquo;s badly-disfigured corpse. It was exhumed and autopsied in 2005 in an FBI probe to find possible accomplices in the crime.</p>
<p>After Till&rsquo;s body was reburied in a new casket, his relatives had hoped to have the original casket donated to a black history museum, but it was discovered rusting in a damp shed at Burr Oak in July during the uncovering of an alleged grave-reselling scam.</p>

		<p>My uncle worked for the FBI all his life.  He wasn&rsquo;t an agent but of course he heard a lot of things.  He told us that Emmett Till actually raped, he didn&rsquo;t merely harass the wife of the man who killed him.</p>
<p>Will the Smithsonian mention that Till&rsquo;s Father was hanged by the US Army for the rape of 2 and murder of 1 Italian women during WW2?  Will the Smithsonian mention that Till was already 5ft 7 about 150 pounds and easily overpowered his small, slender victim? </p>
<p>When will the Smithsonian have an exhibit about the 37,000 White women raped every year by predators like Till?</p>

		<p>To reiterate, Emmett Till&rsquo;s father, Louis Till, was court martialed and executed in Italy during WWII for having raped and murdered an Italian woman.  While sometimes the apple does fall far from the tree, we still don&rsquo;t know exactly what Emmett Till did inside that store to the white woman in question.  Yes, it may have been a wolf whistle, but I infer from the vicious and violent reaction at the hands of the woman&rsquo;s husband and his half-brother that it was a lot more than a simple whistle, it could have been a very forward sexual advance, perhaps a rape threat.</p>

It&rsquo;s worth noting that with all the efforts to promote black history, the blacks who operated Burr Oak Cemetery were unaware of Emmett Till.</p>
<p>Blacks remain ignorant of the history they claim is supposed to help them transcend their past.</p>

		<p>This story is bizarre from beginning to end. Buried in a casket with a glass top so the public could see the badly-disfigured corpse? Exhumed and autopsied in 2005 in a probe to find possible accomplices? Rusting in a damp shed at Burr Oak in July due to the grave-reselling scam? Maybe they ought to just put a revolving door on Till&rsquo;s casket. More evidence that blacks have odd ideas about burying the dead. </p>
<p>And in related news, Michael Jackson still hasn&rsquo;t been buried more than two months after his death.</p>

		<p>They always saya that Till merely &#8220;whistled&#8221; at a whitey GIRL. That GIRL was a 21 year old married woman. And the story goes that Till grabbed the woman by the arm and said: &#8220;hey, baby,  how about a date?&#8221; Then Till went outside and whistled! Probably did do it as a prank, but as a prank that really backfired. The body was not necessarily mutilated but bloated and disfigured from being in the water for two days in mid-summer [Mississippi]!</p>
<p>It constantly amazes me how folks get the basic facts wrong over and over and just repeat the same stuff in finitum, as they say!!</p>

<p>It has lots of pictures, including a recent picture of the grocery where Till originally affronted that woman (today it stands in ruins - I wonder why?) </p>
<p>Please go to this web site and ask the man behind it why he fails to mention, in the details of Emmett&rsquo;s illustrious family history, the part about Daddy Emmett raping and snuffing out Italian women.  The idiot behind this imbecilic hero worship needs to be reminded of reality from time to time. </p>

<p>Emmett Till&rsquo;s mother, before Emmett went away from Chicago to Mississippi to live with his great uncle for the rest of the summer, instructed  him that MS was different from Chi, and not to be his usual flippant and arrogant self in MS that he was in Chi.  Needless to say, he didn&rsquo;t listen.  Mamie Till was from MS herself, and was part of the MS-to-Chi &#8220;great migration&#8221; between WWI and WWII.<br>

		<p>Emmett Till was 5 feet 8 inches tall and 165 pounds. His mother showed the world his fourth grade school picture when we was eight years old and said that was what he looked like when he was killed. He was basically a grown man and it was always alleged he raped the white women that blacks have claimed he merely &#8220;wolf-whistled&#8221; at in a grocery store.</p>
<p>In addition, the reason why his mother was a widow was because his father was a solider in World War II. His father was one of three men shot for war crimes after the liberation of Italy. Emmett Till&rsquo;s father raped two Italian women and killed them. Then, he raped a third and she lived. The apple doesn&rsquo;t fall too far from the tree in this case.</p>

		<p>Notice also how the tribute website has the full address with a picture of the home plus a current photo of the victim. The author also goes into detail about no tresspassing signs on her property. It is as if he wants someone to punish this noe elderly woman for what happened 50 years ago.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re probably closer to the truth than you realize.  As two other posters here noted, Emmett Till&rsquo;s daddy was a psychopathic serial rapist (and murderer) who was executed by the Army in Italy during the closing days of WW2.</p>
<p><a href="https://foia.fbi.gov/till/till.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://foia.fbi.gov/till/till.pdf</a>  (see pg. 19)</p>
<p>Since psychopathy is KNOWN to have a high heritablity factor and Louis Till (Emmett&rsquo;s daddy) was the worst of the worst, the two men who took Emmett and &#8220;gathered him to his fathers&#8221; probably spared a lot of White American females the horrors that befell those women in Italy.</p>

		<p>How about the Smithsonian display the caskets, with graphic details, of the Zebra killings, the Yahweh Ben Yahweh killings, the Colin Ferguson Long Island commuter train massacre, the Wichita massacre, the Knoxville horror, the Tipton GA slaughters, the Hi-Fi killings in Ogden UT, the Crown Heights killing,&hellip;<br>
The fact is the Emmitt Till murder was not racial. The motive was known: He dissed a man&rsquo;s wife. That does not justify the murder, just points out there is nothing to indicate that if someone else had done the same that individual might have suffered the same consequences. God knows people are murdered in black neighborhoods on a daily basis for a lot less: Just looking at someone wrong will get you killed. Much less loudly wolf whistling at another man&rsquo;s girlfriend or wife. And there are black inner city neighborhoods across the nation where non-blacks are killed on sight for no reason at all.<br>

		<p>Funny that they refer to Till as a &#8220;Civil Rights Hero&#8221;, when what he was a would-be rapist who never got the chance to consummate his crime. In the intervening decades, we have seen Black on White rape explode in the absence of cultural strictures, and yes, the threat of family reprisals against the perpetrator. The morays of the South evolved to PROTECT civilized White families from predatory Black males. It worked for 200 plus years, and has now given way to rampant sexual violence directed at White women across the Nation. </p>
<p>Every now and again, a rapist was hung or harmed in an extrajudicial manner, especially in the South. The upside was that White fathers rarely, if ever, had to deal with a shattered daughter, a murdered wife, or a community living in fear. If Emmitt Till is a hero to anyone, it can only be to the rapist, the sexual predator, the violent thug that now terrorizes decent people around the clock, 356 days a year. We HAD that under control, until the Communists let the genie out of the bottle in the 1960&rsquo;s. The same Communists who are now in the White House, on the Supreme Court, and adoring the casket of Emmitt Till. </p>

		<p>  If someone, the parents perhaps,  were to teach these young people how to act in civilized society the world would be a lot better off.</p>
<p>   It reminds me of a time I was on a bus and a 11 or 12 year old black male had his feet on the front seats as a foot rest, where some lady or person would soon come on the bus to sit.  I looked around, there were plenty of adult blacks,  NOT one said anything to him, at all.  I finally told him  &#8220;that is not a footrest&#8221;  you are getting the seat all dirty.   Immediately I came under the wrath of all the blacks on the bus for correcting one of their kind.   If no one teaches them anything,  how do we expect them to know anything ?    It is a far reaching problem</p>
