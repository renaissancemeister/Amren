			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Alexiev, National Review Online, August 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California&rsquo;s financial unraveling has prompted a long-overdue debate about taxes, regulation, and government spending, but the state&rsquo;s media and government continue to ignore what could be an even greater problem: the irreparable damage to California&rsquo;s human capital that nearly 30 years of unrestrained illegal immigration has achieved.</p>
<p>This is not an immigration problem, or even an illegal-immigration problem, per se. A strong case could be made that, in terms of educational achievement, industriousness, and entrepreneurial acumen, Asian immigrants to California have proven superior to white natives of the state. Therefore, if California were to experience a wave of mass immigration from Asia, its long-term economic prospects would be improved. Today&rsquo;s Hispanic immigrants would probably have the same effect if they came from the top 10 to 20 percent of their society according to those same measures of human capital rather than from its bottom rungs. But the influx has instead been composed mainly of the poorly educated, the unskilled, and the illiterate. Such immigrants will likely soon dominate the state&rsquo;s overall population and politics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For a closer glimpse of what&rsquo;s in store for California, look at the Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest in California and the second largest in the country. Of its roughly 700,000 students, almost three-quarters are Hispanic, 8.9 percent are white, and 11.2 percent are black. {snip} A recent study by UC Santa Barbara&rsquo;s California Dropout Research Project estimates that high-school dropouts in 2007 alone will cost the state $24.2 billion in future economic losses.</p>
<p>Even those who graduate aren&rsquo;t necessarily headed to success. According to one study, 69 percent of Latino high-school graduates &#8220;do not meet college requirements or satisfy prerequisites for most jobs that pay a living wage.&#8221; It is difficult to see how the majority-Hispanic labor force of the future can provide the skills that the sophisticated Los Angeles economy demands. Already studies show that as many as 700,000 Los Angeles Latinos and some 65 percent of the city&rsquo;s illegal immigrants work in L.A.&rsquo;s huge underground economy.</p>
<p>{snip} California&rsquo;s educational system, once easily the best in the country, is today mired in mediocrity near the bottom among the 50 states as judged by National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests in math, science, reading, and writing. And for the first time in its history, California is experiencing an increase in adult illiteracy. In 2003, it had the highest adult illiteracy in the United States, 23 percent nearly 50 percent higher than a decade earlier. In some counties (Imperial at 41 percent, Los Angeles at 33 percent) illiteracy approaches sub-Saharan levels.</p>
<p>{snip} California currently ranks 40th among the 50 states in college-attendance rates, and it already faces a significant shortage of college graduates. Studies have shown that the economy will need 40 percent of its workers to be college-educated by 2020, compared with today&rsquo;s 32 percent. Given the aging white population (average age, 42), many of these new graduates will have to come from the burgeoning Latino immigrant population (average age, 26). By one estimate, this would require tripling of the number of college-educated immigrants, an impossibility if current trends hold. The state&rsquo;s inability to improve the educational attainment of its residents will result in a &#8220;substantial decline in per capita income&#8221; and &#8220;place California last among the 50 states&#8221; by 2020, according to a study by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} What can be done to stop this race to the bottom? The answer is simple: California and Washington need to enforce existing immigration law. {snip}</p>
<p>One myth is that because America is a country of immigrants and has successfully absorbed waves of immigration in the past, it can absorb this wave. {snip} First, the immigrant population is more than double today what it was following the most massive previous immigration wave (that of the late 19th century). Second, and much more important, {snip} [r]esearch has shown that even after 20 years in the country, most illegal aliens (the overwhelming majority of whom are Hispanic) and their children remain poor, unskilled, and culturally isolated they constitute a new permanent underclass.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most disingenuous myth about illegal immigrants is that they do not impose any cost on society. The reality is that even those who work and half do not, according to the Pew Hispanic Center cannot subsist on the wages they receive and depend on public assistance to a large degree. Research on Los Angeles immigrants by Harvard University scholar George J. Borjas shows that 40.1 percent of immigrant families with non-citizen heads of household receive welfare, compared with 12.7 percent of households with native-born heads. Illegal immigrants also increase public expenditures on health care, education, and prisons. In California today, illegal immigrants&rsquo; cost to the taxpayer is estimated to be $13 billion half the state&rsquo;s budget deficit.</p>
<p>The state should stop providing welfare and other social services to illegal aliens as existing statutes demand and severely punish employers who break the law by hiring illegal immigrants. {snip}</p>
<p>Milton Friedman once said that unrestrained immigration and the welfare state do not mix. Must we wait until California catches up with Mexico to realize how right he was?<br>

		<p>Here, here.  I&rsquo;m glad the writer included employers among the bad guys.</p>
<p>I realize I&rsquo;m not part of this site&rsquo;s mainstream.  I might even be called a &#8220;liberal race realist,&#8221; because I think that was our country&rsquo;s dominant political philosophy from the 30s-mid 60s.  </p>
<p>From 1945-65 America had a liberal economy and family values, as evidenced by a record marriage rate and baby boom.  The former supports the latter because a person needs economic security to put down roots.  Conservative businessmen who play the whites against the blacks against the Hispanics against the women, to get us all to race to the bottom, are NOT OUR FRIENDS.<br>

		<p>Even though they managed to get a few digs in at Whites with the asian superiority thing, I can&rsquo;t believe that a neocon site would write something like this.  Is it possible that they&rsquo;re finding themselves irrelevant in a country where no one listens to their corporate globalism, invade the world, invite the world philosophy anymore?</p>

		<p>Maybe SOME Asians don&rsquo;t negatively impact the economy or climate, but they&rsquo;re not us, and they&rsquo;re not our people.  Too many Asians, even legal ones, is detrimental to the standard of living of, as Jupiter likes to say, native born white Americans.</p>
<p>The other big problem is the propensity of Indoamericans to tolerate cramped living conditions.  If many people live in one house, then many people can help pay the rent or mortgage.  This drives the rent and mortgage market way up, and considering California&rsquo;s land and water restrictions, it&rsquo;s impossible for working middle class whites to live as they are accustomed to.  A good stop gap measure would be to limit lease agreements and mortgages to one resident&rsquo;s income, even if more than one resident in the house draws an income.  A median $600G for a San Fernando Valley house is intolerable.</p>

		<p>Yes, National Review is a &#8220;Johnny Come Lately&#8221;, on this issue, but better late than never, I guess. The several points in the article addressing the effects of illegal aliens on California, are very accurate. I have lived most of my life in California. All I can really say about the article, having written so much myself about this topic, is that, the article has barely scratched the surface. I could sit down with people who want to hear it, and tell them about the enormous amount of corruption in California on almost any level or area they&rsquo;d be interested in.</p>
<p>As far as illegal aliens go, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s in Real Estate, County employment, City policies, what happens in the courts with them, crime, fraud, outright theft, you name it, I could go on for hours. NO ONE CAN IMAGINE THE SHEER AMOUNT OF CORRUPTION THAT CALIFORNIA IS CAUGHT UP IN BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. There isn&rsquo;t one positive thing about it. Everyone is prone to exaggerate things occasionally, but I&rsquo;m not exaggerating any of what I wrote. I&rsquo;m understating if anything.</p>

<p>Tell Alex Alexiev thanks, but no thanks. The sentence above is defamatory toward the diverse white Americans in California.  This is one of those memes circulated by members of the urban-coastal class to demoralize and denigrate Euro-Americans.</p>
<p>There is no basis for asserting that Asian immigrants are superior to California-born white Americans. And it is interesting to note that Alexiev is comparing immigrants from Asia with California-born Americans.  </p>
<p>This is misleading because it compares different classes (immigrants v. native born), and any differences can be entirely explained by the nature of the immigrant experience.</p>
<p>When you hear members of the urban-coastal class say things like this, take a minute and decode it for misleading claims.</p>

<p>Surely good reason to deny the achievements of whites and facilitate their replacement.<br>

		<p>i used to love california. when our family took a trip out there i was a teen in &#8216;67 i saw what i thought was a paradise on earth. we stayed in a motel in hollywood about 3 blocks behind grauman&rsquo;s chinese theatre. we walked to the theatre at night without fear. the motel didn&rsquo;t have air conditioning due to the cool summer nights. crime was low and the sun was hovering above casting a golden glow over the golden state. college tuition was free and the place was ultra clean and a delightful mixture of nostalgic but well-preserved old and stylish new with innovative ideas and improvements. we returned again in 73 and &#8216;74 and i noticed some differences, mainly and almost entirely due to an increase in hispanic faces wherever we went. faces that weren&rsquo;t there in &#8216;67. we stayed in the imperial 400 across the street from hollywood high school on sunset blvd. for those of you who know l.a., you&rsquo;ll know where i&rsquo;m talking about. i noticed among the students i saw, at least half were hispanic. not good, i thought.<br>
i returned again by myself on a personal trip in 1984. hispanics&hellip;.everywhere. keep in mind this was 25 years ago. i thought not good. i still had my mind made up to move there one day. i returned again to take my medical technologist&rsquo;s license thus preparing myself for an eventual move. my friend and i took the test in an auditorium with hispanics, filopinos and other varied non-whites. we were the only whites in the room of around 300 applicants. my friend got his luggage stolen from the back seat of our rent-a-car one night. everywhere we went we saw hispanics in overwhelming numbers. we found that in santa barbara there were very few there and spent three nights in a delightful and idyllic city with around 85 percent whites. we were in heaven again. we returned back to l.a. the day before our plane trip home and boom&hellip;back to mexico.<br>
i came back both disillustioned and dismayed. i thought - after making a lifetime goal of moving there - that a california move wasn&rsquo;t such a good idea after all. i extrapolated from 1993 into the future and predicted what has happened..i.e. economic collapse and bankruptcy. all this in 40 years. <br>
all i can draw from this is that when america looks like california with such a displacement demographically of whites, we will as a nation face the same consequences.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s painful to  watch NR re-invent the wheel. What happens if these fine ideas don&rsquo;t lead to any change? What happens if more years go by and nothing is changed? A rational person then has to look for solutions in other directions if his/her quality of life is being degraded. An obvious choice is to help whites develop our racial/ethnic identity. That might make life more bearable in a deteriorating situation. How long before NR recommends such a course? I&rsquo;m certainly not going to wait for NR&rsquo;s approval given it has taken them so long to get this far.</p>

<p>NO, it is an immigration problem AND and an illegal-ALIEN problem both. What is the author, a goof? And those students needed to replace the older workers. What work will there be around for them to do EVEN IF they achieve at a higher academic level?  </p>

		<p><i>&hellip;Asian immigrants to California have proven superior to white natives of the state. </i></p>
<p>I require some disambiguation.<br>
Does this statement imply that Asians are NOT superior to African, Native or Hispanic Hyphenated Americans in the specified qualities? <br>
Or does it imply that since White natives are superior to the Hyphenates, the superiority of Asians to Whites, means that Asians are also superior to the Hyphenated Americans? <br>
Or does it imply that Alex Alexiev is afraid to make any derogatory remarks about non-Whites?</p>
<p>Inquiring minds would like to know.</p>

<p>I wish the author (neo-con or not) had expounded on this statement  &mdash;  this is what is driving already satanic taxes even higher, driving businesses into bankruptcy or out of state and has decimated the quality of life in California. </p>
<p>Third World parasites don&rsquo;t come here to work; they come here to get free White Taxpayer money and services.</p>
<p>California has a huge, uneducated, seething hispanic underclass that pays little to no taxes yet demands taxpayer-subsidized health care, education, Section 8 housing, food stamps with constant demands for more.  Any politician who dares mention this obscenely unfair taxpayer burden is axiomatically labeled a racist by hispanic advocacy groups such as sotomeyor&rsquo;s pet group, La Raza.</p>
<p>There is righteous fury here among the taxpayers who are forced to pay for the schools yet cannot send their own children to them because the hispanic parasites, with their low IQs and demands for an ethno-centric curricula have ruined them.  But if I dared mention this at my school, my reputation would be tarnished and my career would be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Maybe DH is right  &mdash;  there is no hope here for us.  We who pay the taxes to support this wretched human tidal wave are vilified, mocked and ridiculed  &mdash;  if we protest, we are called every name for racist and told to &#8216;go back to Europe.&rsquo;  We are told to shut the hell up and cough up our hard earned, hard won money to support foreign nationals and educate their children  &mdash;  foreign nationals who despise us and want what we have without having to work for it.</p>
<p>Lee Bellenger reports that when the dollar finally collapses, government handouts will dry up and this angry dependent class will take to the streets. </p>
<p>And this from the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;California is experiencing an increase in adult illiteracy. In 2003, it had the highest adult illiteracy in the United States, 23 percent nearly 50 percent higher than a decade earlier. In some counties (Imperial at 41 percent, Los Angeles at 33 percent) illiteracy approaches sub-Saharan levels&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the LA Times will continue to print endless illegal alien sob stories on its front pages, pandering to those whose illiteracy rates &#8216;approach sub-Saharan levels.&rsquo;  If they think they&rsquo;re making Whites feel guilty for objecting to unfettered immigration and the resulting satanic taxes and deteriorating quality of life, they are wrong.</p>

<p>The Mexican invaders do this everywhere, including here in Seattle where I live.</p>
<p>Since the invaders are working and transacting business &#8220;underground&#8221; WHO is paying for all the resources and services the invaders consume? (check out the local schools and hospital emergency rooms)</p>
<p>The answer is the  above ground working people whose employers extract the taxes and the above ground businesses that can&rsquo;t escape the state, local and federal tax collectors, that&rsquo;s who!</p>
<p>I have attempted to ask my neighborhood invaders, both Mexican and Cambodian, if they think it is fair that others pay for them? They either tell me to go fornicate myself or act dumb like The question is too complex.</p>
<p>I can tell you this, that once my neighborhood invaders extract some money from the &#8220;underground&#8221; economy, they immediately get above ground and purchase Cadillac Escalades, multiple satellite TV services and the glow of those massive flat-screen TVs can be seen all over the cul-de-sac at night! None of these consumer goods to &#8220;too complex for them.&#8221; </p>
<p>BTW, ALL of my local cul-de-sac invaders first showed up in the neighborhood with CALIFORNIA license plates.</p>

		<p>The oriental is not more intelligent as claimed in the article.  It took years of destruction for our education system to become so declined.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be better to think of their better results in the immigration process as more focused.  I&rsquo;d tend to believe they give family and an introspection more priority which translates into better performance.  </p>
<p>Think about that in relation to the Mexican and black social life.</p>

		<p> &#8220;Research on Los Angeles immigrants by Harvard University scholar George J. Borjas shows that 40.1 percent of immigrant families with non-citizen heads of household receive welfare, compared with 12.7 percent of households with native-born heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>  The late Nobel prize winning economist, Milton Friedman, said that no welfare state could long exist with open borders. I think we are seeing the disintegration of America and California will be first in the nation. </p>

		<p>&#8216;Asian immigrants to California have proven superior to white natives of the state&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh, yes, please asians save us poor whites from ourselves with your ethnic markets and restaurants and high SAT scores.</p>
<p>Asians aren&rsquo;t demographically a huge factor in California, but I still tire of comments like these.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to ask the &#8216;who&rsquo;s superior&rsquo; question.  All you have to do is look at the flow of people from there to here.  Interestingly enough, you don&rsquo;t see huge numbers of whites begging to get into China.</p>
<p>I agree with Jupiter and others, they are not our people and we have nothing in common with them in either culture or language.</p>
<p>BTW, If you live in LA or have been here, asians love to drive around in BMW&rsquo;s &amp; mercedes.  Gee, I wonder what race invented these companies&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;A strong case could be made that, in terms of educational achievement, industriousness, and entrepreneurial acumen, Asian immigrants to California have proven superior to white natives of the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first thought that went through my brain after reading the above sentence is: Arthur Jensen was born in San Diego, CA, that makes him a white Californian native.<br>
And white dudes established the aerospace industry, electronics industry in the bay area, the Hollywood movie industry, founded the California Institute of Technology, UC Berkley, UCLA, Stanford University. <br>
William Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor and winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, received his undergraduate degree at the California Institute of Technology. His efforts to commercialize the transistor resulted in California&rsquo;s Silicon Valley.<br>
My favorite rock group the Doors, from Los Angeles and the Beach Boys are California natives.<br>

<p>&#8220;Maybe SOME Asians don&rsquo;t negatively impact the economy or climate, but they&rsquo;re not us, and they&rsquo;re not our people. Too many Asians, even legal ones, is detrimental to the standard of living of, as Jupiter likes to say, native born white Americans.</p>
<p>The other big problem is the propensity of Indoamericans to tolerate cramped living conditions. If many people live in one house, then many people can help pay the rent or mortgage. This drives the rent and mortgage market way up, and considering California&rsquo;s land and water restrictions, it&rsquo;s impossible for working middle class whites to live as they are accustomed to. A good stop gap measure would be to limit lease agreements and mortgages to one resident&rsquo;s income, even if more than one resident in the house draws an income. A median $600G for a San Fernando Valley house is intolerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; You are SO right!</p>
<p>&gt; Not only that, but few ever mention what Asian have done to the enviroment in California, especially Northern California. They have fished illegally, taking too small fish, etc., overlimits, abused commerical fishing in similar way.  They have runs for example, abalone poaching and smuggling rings that have descemated the abalone populations.  Same for such seemingly inconsequential items as sea-anenomes for sushi.  Asians have ruined the long prized and carefully managed wild mushroom fields in the forests as well.  There was a near shooting war on the Northern California/Oregon border a few years back, in an effort to drive them off.   They ravage everything and leave sterile useless land behind.  More in North America only means greatly acceleratted denigration of our beautiful lands.  For those conservatives who hate the notion of preserving the enviroment, you ought to love these guys.</p>

		<p>Several posters have taken issue with the assumed advantages of Asian immigration to California, and how it benefits the state of California. Now I will take issue with it. I don&rsquo;t see Asian immigration benefitting California in any way. The whole notion that it does,is so absurd as to make me laugh hysterically. I have lived in California longer than most people who live in it now, much longer. Even though I was a young kid at the time, I saw who built up California and made it into a powerhouse. With the exception of the Japanese who lived here, and a very small Chinese group, there were no Asians in California. They had no substantial impact on it becoming a SuperState, NONE!</p>
<p>As for those Asians who have come since, I seriously question the so-called advantages of having them here. Oh, I know, people will point out the guy who created Yahoo, or some other aspect of internet or computer technology etc., but even in this field, Asians in no way,come even close to contributing what whites have accomplished. What about other areas? There is an enormous amount of criminality in the Asian community involving various &#8220;busnesses.&#8221; No I&rsquo;m not just talking about the well kwown scams of the &#8220;massage parlors&#8221; which Asians own by the hundreds if not thousands in California. There is the criminality that goes on in import and export businesses, the gross violations of immigration laws, unpaid business taxes, and all kinds of graft and corruption in the medical field, involving state benefits to elderly Asians.</p>
<p>As far as Asian smarts goes in school, sure many Asians work hard and earn good grades, but even when I went to school, they weren&rsquo;t adverse to cheating when it was neccessary. Again, I exclude the Japanese, because I grew up with them and saw how honorable these people were. They have always in my experience, been the most honorable of citizens. Now, none of this is to say that there aren&rsquo;t Asians who are honest hardworking people. On the whole however, I see no advantage that California or any other state for that matter, has, in having them as immigrants. I simply don&rsquo;t see them as superior. One of the smartest Supervisors I ever worked with was a brilliant Irish woman, who was a computer programmer. She was showing some Asians in her department(human resources)how things have to be done. Whites have shown themselves fully capable, at every age and time, of building the most modern societies in the world. Today, however, many, many, forces are at work to deny white people their just recognition and honor.</p>

<p>From one perspective Asians are good for the US consumer. They are hard working with a me-too attitude, so as soon as they see one kind of retail enterprise succeed, they merely duplicate it and try to work harder. That forces retail prices down. The bad side is that they tend to drive each other out of business and into bankruptcy at a fairly quick rate, but only after rapidly inflating a local business micro-bubble. Examples: strip mall restaurants, frozen yogurt stores, muffler, tire, and transmission shops, mini-markets, gas stations, etc. So instead of gradually innovating and transforming their businesses to maintain profitability, they simply drive them off a cliff while attempting to keep up with a business across the street where the proprietor does the exact same thing but can get more family members to work for him gratis.</p>
<p>Monkey-see-monkey-do capitalism results in a lot of empty commercial real estate, defaulted bank loans, and a rising need by failed merchants to collect public relief until they find some other business to imitate. It also turns the virtue of industry into a vice, where businesses that would ordinarily sustain a family at middle class levels become joyless subsistence enterprises. The Asian economic success story in California over the past two decades, at least the way I see, has come to an end, since it depended heavily on rising real estate prices. In other words, immigrant Asian businessmen created just enough profit to enable them to get loans for additional property purchases, that rapidly increased in value as more immigrants flooded in looking to open stores or rent apartments. But now that CA real estate has maxed out, the economy has deflated, and rents are declining, all that&rsquo;s left are desperate people working themselves to death with no long term hope of big profit or anything like a retirement nest egg. It was a nice ride while it lasted, since usually Asians found themselves at the top of the immigrant pyramid scheme economy, but now the pyramid is no more. Many are left stranded now in a country where they don&rsquo;t speak the language, and are finding themselves worse off than they were in their home country. Will they leave?</p>
<p>Doubtful, because the next big monkey-see-monkey-do scheme is education for the next generation. Every Asian parent whips his kids into a frenzy over getting into the best ranked public university possible, with the hope that somehow this will guarantee high salary jobs in the future. After graduation these kids flow into all the usual professional trades. Of  course this will drastically drive down the earnings of accountants, optometrists, actuaries, doctors, dentists, and   &mdash;   as is already true   &mdash;   research PhDs   &mdash;   to ridiculously low levels, once again turning them into subsistence enterprises. Right now 95% of the optometry class at UC Berkeley is Asian. They will probably all open stores within 10 miles of each other. Maybe someday they will pay off their education loans, but I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on it if Asian immigration to the Bay Area continues at its current pace.<br>

		<p>Whiteplight, you talk about what Asians have done to the environment in California. We&rsquo;ve had a big controversy here in southern Ontario about Asians and fishing. The local white people have taken to &#8220;nipper tipping&#8221; which is knocking them off the docks into the water. There&rsquo;s been the accusation of over fishing etc. The human rights commission has taken up the anti-racism cause and said there is no evidence of Asians abusing the fishing resource; the local whites are needful of education instead. So it&rsquo;s interesting to see the same accusation in California. </p>

These neocon mouthpieces are responsible for two costly wars, doubling of the illegal alien population, subversion of the Republican Party and damaging globalist economic policies.

		<p>Actually, if you look at Alexiev&rsquo;s background, he&rsquo;s merely another neocon, hence his snide remarks regarding Asians vs Whites. Asians do work hard, but in point of fact, they are also able to take advantage of many govt programs, and have done so, for almost 40 years in CA, truth be told. For instance, if you&rsquo;re white, try going to the SBA for a business loan in CA. Damn near impossible for most whites to get a nickel with the exception of a few choice groups. Now, if you&rsquo;re Asian, wealthy or poor, good or mediocre or even poor credit, stroll into that same office. You&rsquo;ll get the royal treatment as do all other non-whites. Things are out of control, but the good part is that the big collapse is coming. And the smug Marxists, the neocons, their lobbyists in DC and their friends running the media won&rsquo;t be able to hold this artificial situation together. It&rsquo;s going to get very bad, but in the long run, that&rsquo;s very good for whites. </p>

		<p>No economy can run on just a professional class, so it&rsquo;s not beneficial to have a growing Asian professional class in the population of California.</p>
<p>For every one professional, you need many people doing blue-collar jobs.  If the professional is of one race, and the people on the tier below are of another race, it is a set-up for a racially and economically stratified society, with little connection across racial lines.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen this before - in Africa with the Indian bourgeoisie, and in the Asian-Pacific with the Chinese migrant merchants and doctors.</p>

		<p>This all boils down to lawyers, politics and enforcement of immigration laws.  The lawyers/politicians have refused to implement US immigration laws, not even after 9/11. This reveals the US COnsititution is no longer being upheld by those who have taken the oath over many decades.  Like all the other failures: FBI (9/11), Fan &amp; Fred, SEC, etc., there is never accountability, copnsequences or punishment for failure.  How&rsquo;s that for good government????????

<p>Yes, exactly.  You&rsquo;d think that in such an &#8216;environmentally conscious&rsquo; area such as California, especially Northern California, the &#8216;spawning ground&rsquo; of many of the eco- movements (going back to John Muir) these cases would be highly publicized with environmental spokespeople screaming bloody hell.  Seems their response is&hellip;.silence. </p>
<p>Better to go after White lumber interests, sit in redwood trees, destroy logging machinery and burn new housing developments  &mdash;  more publicity and money there.</p>
<p>Or, did soros silence these movements as he silenced the Sierra Club?</p>
<p>From the San Francisco Bay Area:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The church founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon will pay $500,000 to restore damaged habitat   &mdash;   and avoid prosecution   &mdash;   in the case of a pastor who poached hundreds of baby sharks from San Francisco Bay, federal prosecutors said Monday.</p>
<p>California leopard sharks, which can take 13 years to reach maturity, live as long as 30 years, and are protected under a state law that prohibits the commercial catching of specimens under 36 inches long.</p>
<p>&#8216;We want the smaller the better,&rsquo; he said. Moon himself became excited when he learned about the shark-catching operation&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Also this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Poaching of wildlife has become epidemic in California. </p>
<p> Bear gallbladders can go for $5,000 a pound, an enticing price that has spurred bear poaching in California. Bear gallbladders are used in traditional Asian medicine and bear paws, considered a delicacy in soup&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Abalone too:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Surveys have shown no significant reproductive events in red abalone in more than a decade. The growth rate of north coast red abalone is extremely slow, taking up to 10 years for abalone to reach legal size. The southern California fishery was closed in 1997 due to its near depletion.</p>
<p>A five-month investigation into suspected Northern California abalone poaching by a band of San Francisco divers culminated Thursday with four arrests</p>
<p>Wardens arrested Li Sheng Chen, 52, ..also taken into custody were Wu Qiang Zhang, 40, Nichole Zhang Li, 43, and Betty Ai Hang Guo, 30, all of San Francisco&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also read legal hunter&rsquo;s anecdotal accounts of encountering Asian poachers and their fury at the poachers&rsquo; disregard for hunting laws, hunting licenses and legal limits as to what and how many can be taken.  Also accounts of entire fishing and forest areas barren of game due to illegal poaching.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s those six hunters that were killed in Wisconsin by a Hmong immigrant that refused to respect American laws&hellip;</p>

<p>I see this in my neighborhood.  The Persians have been here for 30 years, starting a few years before the Shah fell.  They are mostly Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians.  Their businesses have been around a long time, and will be passed on to the next generation.  Their business practices are corrupt of course, but they do stay in business.</p>
<p>The Asians are in and out, in and out.  They open up a store and it disappears in a few years.  Some of it is typical immigrant scams.  A con man sells someone still in his Asian country a yogurt store, never mentioning that there are 5 other yogurt stores within 2 blocks.  It&rsquo;s obvious that the Asians are burn and slash business people.</p>

		<p>Actually, what the E. Asians and East Indians do is &#8220;sell&#8221; their business to friends/family members after three years to avoid taxes. Of course, they haven&rsquo;t really sold the business. They simply have an agreement to share in the profits with the &#8216;new&rsquo; owners. The profits are put into other businesses that may or may not be &#8220;sold&#8221; to more immigrant friends and relatives. This cycle repeats itself over and over. To compound things, as noted above, the SBC throws money at these people and isn&rsquo;t exactly too keen on going after them if they default, seeing as how they are just poor, disadvantaged non-whites. It&rsquo;s a mess, all of it funded by whites who are controlled by a government looking to make them extinct. </p>
