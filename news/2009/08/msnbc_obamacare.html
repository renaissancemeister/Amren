			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kyle Drennen, NewsBusters, August 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Tuesday, MSNBC&rsquo;s Contessa Brewer fretted over health care reform protesters legally carrying guns: &#8220;A man at a pro-health care reform rally .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wore a semiautomatic assault rifle on his shoulder and a pistol on his hip.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there are questions about whether this has racial overtones .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. white people showing up with guns.&#8221; Brewer failed to mention the man she described was black.</p>
<p>Following Brewer&rsquo;s report, which occurred on the Morning Meeting program, host Dylan Ratigan and MSNBC pop culture analyst Toure discussed the supposed racism involved in the protests. {snip} Ratigan agreed: &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then they get the variable of a black president on top of all these other things and that&rsquo;s the move  &mdash;  the cherry on top, if you will, to the accumulated frustration for folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only did Brewer, Ratigan, and Toure fail to point out the fact that the gun-toting protester that sparked the discussion was black, but the video footage shown of that protester was so edited, that it was impossible to see that he was black. {snip}<br>

		<p>And the black man in question, from what I understand, is something of a mini-Al Sharpton style perpetual malcontent in the Valley.  I looked at the pictures, and I have a sneaking suspicion that the supposed &#8220;assault rifle&#8221; was merely a piece of plastic.</p>

		<p>I was waiting for this to show up. This was one of the most sickening things I&rsquo;ve seen MSNBC come up with lately. </p>
<p>The more sickening thing is that they panned the camera at certain angles so that viewers couldn&rsquo;t accurately identify the man&rsquo;s race, then went off on a tangent about white, racist, gun-loving extremists attending these protests.</p>
<p>Surreal.</p>

		<p>I bet the MSM is furious about the internet. The access to information people have makes it harder and harder for them to spread their outright lies. This is proof that they&rsquo;re still trying, though. </p>

		<p>I for one would love to stick that image in her face and confront her about her journalistic accuracy and/or incompetence. Well then again, maybe not. If they watched the whole video over at MSNBC, they are just a bunch of dishonest people that can&rsquo;t even be honest with themselves. I wonder how they can sleep at night to foment these sorts of lies. Guess only a liberal mind is capable of something so blatantly false.</p>
<p>Just further proof that there is an undeclared war against white people in America.</p>

		<p><i>Contessa Brewer</i> </p>
<p>An outright professional liar, a standout among an entire profession of liars in that she&rsquo;s been caught red-handed.</p>
<p>She should come to work to find a pink slip and an empty box on her desk, and charged with disturbing the peace.</p>
<p><i>Ratigan, and Toure</i> </p>
<p>Both guilty of, at the very least, aiding and abetting criminal misconduct on the part of the miscreant Brewer (inciting racial hatred or disturbing the peace or somesuch).</p>
<p>Free speech doesn&rsquo;t mean the right to shout fire in a crowded theater.  All three should be fired immediately.</p>

		<p>Well, this is the sort of thing you get from watching a garbage cable network like MSNBC.  They are left-oriented to the point of being Marxist.  Few people watch them any more; anybody who wants good news programs goes to Fox News Channel.  Their ratings are deservedly high - they beat out even the national network channels.  So the wacko channels (read: MSNBC etc.) are desperate, and will go to any lengths to fabricate news, as is apparent from this story.  The only people who buy it are the minorities who want to make whites look bad.  And we all know how smart THEY are!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Video footage edited to hide the fact that the man with a rifle was black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and the simpleton who was raling about white racists with guns was white herself.</p>
<p>MSNBC, CNN, and ALL the other media outlets make it plain they are going to be first in line on any payback list, and I suspect quite a few different people have their eye on them.</p>
<p>They should be tried, convicted and sentenced to black communities for life, outside our own areas of well-fortified positions.  It is those types who are responsible for this entire mess.</p>

		<p>What is happening to the World?<br>
The more of this type of stuff I see (see &#8216;UK race riot cover up&rsquo; from yesterday being similar), the more naive I realize I must be.<br>
Whatever happened to being impartial and objective?<br>
This is tantamount to inciting racial violence against Whites and if a single White person is assaulted anywhere on Earth because of this, the blood is on MSNBC&rsquo;s hands.<br>
They should at least have to run with a Surgeon General&rsquo;s type of warning proceeding their broadcasts along the lines of <br>
&#8220;what you are about to view is a combination of fact and fiction and should not be taken seriously as this stations editorial staff choose to input their own political biases and opinions.&#8221;<br>
(That feels too weak, but you get my drift.)</p>
<p>By the way some of the bloggers who frequent this site may find this precedent to be ominous.<br>

		<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m in favor of universal health coverage but I can&rsquo;t help but notice the bias in the media on this issue specifically. They do an entire newscast covering the meetings and &#8216;debates&rsquo; but never do we hear what opponents of the health care bill have to say, only what the leftists say the opposition is saying, at the very most.</p>

		<p>I have no idea if this &#8220;Chris&#8221; is a racial agitator,  but from what I&rsquo;ve read he was  mixing it up aggressively against  the pro-Obama people.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that rifle is fake. It looks like he has an Eotech sight installed on it.  I doubt that a non gunny would even think of it for a fake rifle&hellip; Plus it looks like he has a loaded magazine in his back pocket.</p>

		<p>AmRen readers, I have said it here before and I am saying it again. I suspect the whole deal of gun owners showing up at rallies with guns is an &#8220;agent provacatuer&#8221; situation. A few unidentified peopled show up with guns and the Secret Service allows it? In different parts of the country simultanously!<br>
I think they want a bunch of &#8220;right wing nuts to show up and step over the ill defined line.Then the press can use the momentum to inflict a draconian gun law on us. Of course they call us a white. Be wise as serpants and gentle as lambs&hellip; </p>

		<p>Obama won the election, and I think for the most part we should support him until the next election. And unlike what &#8216;liberals&rsquo; claim, I&rsquo;m not much into &#8216;debate&rsquo;. Better to be united going somewhere than to be divided, and personally, I&rsquo;m in favor of universal health care, but I can&rsquo;t help noticing that the television coverage is hypocritical. The media says, &#8220;we&rsquo;ll be back after commercial to discuss the latest health care myths&#8221; sounding neutral. When they cover the story they never once bring up &#8216;myths&rsquo; that those on the left believe. Not once. It&rsquo;s always myths those against health care reform believe, and told from the perspective of the leftists! Basically the &#8216;leftist media&rsquo; is presenting both the leftist position and the position of those on the right, as if this is the old &#8216;Archy Bunker&rsquo; show. Or just about every other show on TV.</p>
<p>&#8216;Fox news&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t much better. It&rsquo;s like liberals have been hired to present a conservative slant on the news, but to try and make it sound authentic. It could even be a sincere attempt, but the employees are mostly from a liberal or neocon background. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell us we have an open media when we don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I am in favor of it too, but it is quite possible to hear the protests against it because it has been so violent and loud.  I really don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about here.  I keep waiting to hear someone make a good point, a legitimate one.  For example, how Obama is set to naturalize illegals so his promise of no care for illegals is a lie.  Or that the legislation also provides for grants to university med schools to be based on minority recruitment.  But the conservative protest is not only unhelpful, it is wrong-headed.  The conservative protestors are only spewing slogans learned from being the dupes of the health care insurance lobbies as the GOP is once again, a sellout to corporate interests.  I can hardly see or hear anyone make an intelligent protest, just extreme and easily debunked claims of Nazism, totalitarianism, socialism, end of life issues, removal of present government paid health care for seniors, etc.  We could be making sure that the right universal health care bill be passed that closes the loopholes that will later cause problems for the plan, like naturalizing illegals, increasing assylum quotas, etc., making sure that our white children can go to med school, but instead conservatives are throwing away the opportunity to debate it intelligently and making the right look like a bunch of over-reacting, dim-wits, without even high school educations.</p>
<p>Still waiting for the much vaunted, genetic high IQ of whites to kick in&hellip;..<br>

Dude, yesterday was Barney Frank day. During the entire segment/segments of the news, not once did we hear or read what the opposition had to say, only what Barney Frank had to say about them. What Barney Frank said they said. We have Barney Frank characterizing the opposition, and of course Barney Frank&rsquo;s position. </p>
<p>I will admit, it would be easy enough to put embarrassing coverage of health care opponents - on the news, to, well, embarrass them, providing &#8216;balance&rsquo; and complete coverage, but the news media hasn&rsquo;t even done that. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, #4, the spread of truth over the Internet is the primary reason the MSM, and the oligarchs it serves, are committed to stopping this free flow of information.  We were so tired of television&rsquo;s never-ending horror stories about the danger of the internet that we decided to take action.  Or inaction.  We did not bother to get convertor boxes.  The televisions sit, now, in their cartons, in a store room.  We may keep one for watching DVDs.  Otherwise, they&rsquo;re waiting for the next charity rummage sale.</p>
<p>Expect the minions of the Oligarchy to whittle away at what can be said over the net.  It&rsquo;s already started.  So save information you are finding.  It may soon disappear.  Ranch Rescue and Angry White Female have already been silenced.  Who&rsquo;s next?</p>
