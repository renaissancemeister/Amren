<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The governor is blaming race for his political troubles again  &mdash;  saying some people are uncomfortable seeing so many black politicians in power.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of what I feel is that one very successful minority is permissible, but when you see too many success stories, then some people get nervous,&#8221; Paterson told political blogger Gerson Borrero in a report posted Monday.</p>
<p>His angry rhetoric came on the heels of a rant on Friday, when he told Daily News columnist Errol Louis that he is a victim of an &#8220;orchestrated&#8221; media campaign to push him from office.</p>
<p>He claimed President Obama is next on the target list.</p>
<p>Obama spokesman Bill Burton said Monday the President does not believe criticism of him is necessarily racially motivated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Paterson] said he understands the criticism over the budget and the Senate leadership battle, but Paterson suggested to Borrero that he is held to a different standard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems I have to work twice as hard as others,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And it still bothers him that people refer to him as the &#8220;accidental governor.&#8221; He took office last year after former Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned amid a prostitution scandal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paterson did back away from at least one assertion  &mdash;  that the media, as a whole, are racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think the media has acted in a racist way, but I have felt stereotyped at times,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new Siena Research Institute poll taken before the governor&rsquo;s comments Friday showed his job approval rating at a meager 23% and his favorability rating at just 32%.</p>

		<p>You would think black politicians of areas that are majority non-black would begin to realize that screeching racism at their constituents or other non-blacks is working against them. People won&rsquo;t vote for them a) so they don&rsquo;t have to hear the screeching, and b) so there can be fair debate on the issues, so there won&rsquo;t be &#8220;you don&rsquo;t like my policy on X?  You&rsquo;re racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like job situations I&rsquo;ve been in.  Most of my coworkers are liberal, but even they are tired of the black employees screaming racism so they can get what they want or so they can get out of trouble for not doing their jobs.  No other race does that (at my particular job).  </p>

<p>When you look at every city and country run by blacks, the civilization goes down the drain.  Someone prove me I&rsquo;m wrong without calling me a &#8216;racist&rsquo; or &#8216;uneducated&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Politics is for big boys.  If you can not tolerate someone disagreeing with you you are not suited to political life.  Or are you such a nitwit that you can not defend your positions except by crying &#8220;they don&rsquo;t like me because I am colored&#8221;.  Boo hoo.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a resident of NY State and Paterson&rsquo;s comments are an attempt to cover for his own incompetence. I&rsquo;m right in the state capital and almost everyone thinks Paterson is a clown and don&rsquo;t take his racial whining seriously. His latest stunt of giving welfare moms 200$ to buy school supplies took the cake. Needless to say there was a rush on lottery tickets and malt liquor. </p>
<p>I do love his attacks on the cowardly PC media that has propped this guy up for his entire unearned term. What an ingrate! </p>

		<p>Of course Whites are uncomfortable seeing so many blacks in power. Blacks in power means your community/country will soon become unlivable for you and your White children. One only has to look anywhere in the world where blacks dominate as proof. Look how well Whites are doing in Africa living with these black <br>

		<p>At the risk of sounding like Pollyanna I think there has been one area of improvement in racial issues in the last decade: black racial arsonists (Paterson, Jeremiah Wright, Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick) are more likely to get slammed for playing the race card than in the past.</p>
<p>The likes of Coleman Young, Jesse Jerkson, Julian Bond etc. used to spew hate all the time and never be called on it by the media.   </p>

<p>Why elect a black if this kind of childish whining is what is espoused every time his policies or programs are criticized?</p>
<p>We are cursed with whites who feel compelled to prove they aren&rsquo;t racist, and others that have some kind of sick need to feel altruistic.</p>
<p>The other races don&rsquo;t have that problem.  We need to get rid of, or away from, a lot of the wrong kind of whites in order to have a workable society, free of people who have mental disabilities. just as much as we need to be free of black moochers.</p>

		<p>Patterson thinks &#8220;success stories&#8221; of blacks make us nervous? I don&rsquo;t care if the White House is full of polka-dotted people, I just want them to be honest. Look at the people Obama has surrounded himself with and show me an honest person&hellip;they&rsquo;re either tax cheats, a self-avowed communist or &#8220;community organizers&#8221; who are bullies. Government waste and fraud will continue as long as there are politicians. The invasion from the south will continue and games will still be played until we get someone in office who put his/her citizens first. </p>

I tuned into c-spans&rsquo; Washington Journal this morning before I left for work. Everyone should. It&rsquo;s an earful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become a venting ground for angry blacks who don&rsquo;t like people (read: racist white folk) criticizing President Obama.</p>
<p>As I said before, blacks don&rsquo;t want an Obama. They want and expect a Mugabe who will rule with a dictatorial iron fist and crush his opponents.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not racism that will get him out of office, it&rsquo;s racism that got him into office in the first place.  The racism of being brought along as Lt. Governor because he was the &#8220;least-worst&#8221; black candidate.  AND he&rsquo;s blind too so his kingmakers get double gold stars for finding him.</p>
<p>Affirmative Action is a scarlett letter that says &#8220;He didn&rsquo;t really earn it. He isn&rsquo;t as smart as the white guy who got passed over.  His degree isn&rsquo;t worth what it once was.&#8221;  He is an AA governor and Obama is an AA president and everyone knows it.  Let&rsquo;s hear him speak out against the racism that has done so much to benefit him&hellip;</p>

		<p>Paranoia comes from knowing that one doesn&rsquo;t have the qualifications for the office. Realizing that one is held to a lower set of standards and given a free pass. Understanding full well that the privileges of affirmative action come with a price: low self-esteem.<br>

		<p>  How does Governor Paterson, who is legally blind, determine someone&rsquo;s race? Is it something about a person&rsquo;s accent, or speech, or even smell? How do educated black New Yorkers sound different than whites?  I really don&rsquo;t know how he makes race distinctions as a blind man  &mdash;  can he explain?</p>

<p>Good question,and I have an observation.</p>
<p>Without my glasses,according to the optometrist,I am legally blind. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t drive,work,or much of anything,honestly. It just means that if I don&rsquo;t have my glasses on,I&rsquo;m legally blind,and if I were to see something and have to testify to what I saw,if I saw it w/o my glasses on,my testimony either wouldn&rsquo;t be relied upon,OR I could maybe convince a jury that the weird looking blurred stuff I saw is really what I think I saw.</p>
<p>Now I have no idea if the optometrist was telling me the truth,but if he was,there&rsquo;s a huge potential difference between being legally blind,and not being able to see anything at all.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m wondering just how blind this character is to begin with. Maybe not as blind as everyone seems to think.</p>
