<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On just one day this year on the Red Lake reservation in northern Minnesota, police and investigators received emergency calls about one suicide, one murder, three stabbings, two shootings and multiple incidents of domestic violence.</p>
<p>Federal statistics have shown American Indians are the victims of violent crime at more than twice the national rate, with incidence of homicide and domestic violence much higher than the national average.</p>
<p>The Obama administration was expected to announce today a new effort to combat crime on reservations, where shortages of law enforcement personnel and federal dollars have led to lawless environments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Increased federal dollars will probably also be part of the equation, Ogden [Deputy Attorney General David Ogden] said.</p>
<p>Reports of violence on reservations  &mdash;  especially the poorest and most remote  &mdash;  are constant. Red Lake has certainly known its share of crimes. In 2005, a 16-year-old there killed seven people at his school and two people on the reservation.</p>
<p>Gang activity has risen in tribes across the country as drug traffickers have taken advantage of gaps in law enforcement.</p>
<p>Still, little is known about what exactly is happening on reservations or how the incidents are handled. Data has been sparse for decades and crime surveys rarely separate out tribal statistics. Ogden says better data collection is one of the department&rsquo;s priorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The issue of jurisdiction has also long been an obstacle. The Justice Department shares responsibility for Indian crime with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which is part of the Department of Interior, and with state and tribal governments. Jurisdiction over a crime can vary by state, by the severity of the crime and by whether the victim and suspect are Indian or non-Indian.</p>
<p>While the Bureau of Indian Affairs polices reservations, the Justice Department&rsquo;s role involves investigating and prosecuting crimes that fall under federal jurisdiction and administering grant programs designed to reduce crime on reservations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ogden says the government has failed to provide adequate resources and basic protections.</p>
<p>&#8220;All kinds of crime flourish in that environment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There hasn&rsquo;t been enough sustained leadership attention.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I thought the tax-free revenues from the gaming parlors on North American aborigine reservations were supposed to correct all this.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t the purpose of the reservations to give the Indians sovereignty over their own affairs? Why is federal money going to the reservations at all? The federal government should stop interfering in INdian affairs and allow them to sink or swim according to their own abilities.</p>

		<p>What!!! A school massacre happened and it was not headline news across the country. This is the first I have heard of it. Wow &hellip; it never ceases to amaze me what the MSM cover up.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Justice to Boost Effort to Combat Tribal Crime.&#8221;  Thank goodness the Justice Department is, now, involved.  Just knowing that these highly capable, virtuous, modern day Knights of the Round Table have swung into action should make us all sleep better at night.<br>

&ldquo;On just one day this year on the Red Lake reservation in northern Minnesota, police and investigators received emergency calls about one suicide, one murder, three stabbings, two shootings and multiple incidents of domestic violence.&rdquo;  What is the big deal?  This happens every 15 minutes in Detroit.<br>
  <br>
&ldquo;Still, little is known about what exactly is happening on reservations or how the incidents are handled.&rdquo;  And, actually, nobody in Washington really cares.  The Obama Bureaucrats just suddenly realized the Indian was a federally recognized and protected minority so Attorney General Holder&rsquo;s agency will pay the &ldquo;Red Man&rdquo; a little lip service.<br>
   <br>
&ldquo;Ogden says the government has failed to provide adequate resources and basic protections.&rdquo;  I agree, the government has not only failed to enforce the Southern boundary with Mexico but has been callous, heartless, and insensitive to the protection of our Folk (the European American) from 20 to 30 million illegal Mexicans.       </p>

<p>Red Lake reservation is about 565,000 acres, about the size of Rhode Island.  The Red Lake website didn&rsquo;t say how many people live in Red Lake.  For an entity the size of Rhode Island, the crime rate seems extremely low.</p>
<p>The Red Lake Indians seem to have been one of those never surrendered tribes and have always administrated their own territory with minimal superversion by the BIA.</p>
<p>Like every police force in America, they are eligible for and could use federal help to buy police cars, computers, radios, at least one helicopter and other expensive items.</p>
<p>A real problem for Indian reservations and indeed all rural areas especially west of the Mississippi Missouri rivers is the huge size.  The nearest officer can be 50 miles away when he or she gets a call.</p>
<p>Crime on Indian reservations is mostly rowdy young men doing what rowdy young men do and domestic violence.  There is a lot of drunk driving, but with the roads so empty and low population density, there are not many drunk driving accidents because there are no other cars to smash into.<br>
