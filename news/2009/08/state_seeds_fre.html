<h1>State Seeds Fresh Food Delivery in Detroit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kimberly Hayes Taylor, Detroit News, August 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The MI (pronounced &#8220;my&#8221;) Neighborhood Food Movers, a fresh food delivery program that officially launches Tuesday, is designed to change that for some Detroit residents. Gov. Jennifer Granholm&rsquo;s office has invested $75,000 in seed money for the pilot program, which they plan to develop into a larger initiative that will include urban gardens, more delivery services, cooking classes and other programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We needed some way to get fresh produce into the community,&#8221; said Kim Trent, director of the governor&rsquo;s southeast Michigan office in Detroit, who is working with Detroit nonprofits, businesses and other state departments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The program represents a gleam of hope for Detroiters who haven&rsquo;t had access to fresh produce. A 2007 study concluded that Detroiters had limited access to full-service grocery stores, largely due to a lack of transportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that 92 percent of food providers in Detroit are what we call fringe  &mdash;  liquor stores, gas stations, party stores, dollar stores, pharmacies and convenient stores,&#8221; said Mari Gallagher, president of Mari Gallagher Research &amp; Consulting Group in Chicago, who conducted the food desert study. &#8220;Only 8 percent are small, medium and large grocery stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Food Movers program will operate with deliveries to three Detroit neighborhoods, and, on designated days, to high-traffic areas such as church parking lots on Sundays. The drivers are entrepreneurs who received marketing, technical support and loans to purchase specially marked delivery trucks that allow shoppers to select fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>A partnership between the state and Eastern Market Corp. will keep the produce prices competitive with grocery stores or big-box supermarkets. Customers also will have several payment options, including cash, credit, debit or the Michigan Bridge Card.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>M.J. &#8220;Butch&#8221; Robinson of Highland Park has been driving the Peaches &amp; Greens truck through his city, the central Woodward area and other parts of Detroit&rsquo;s west side for a couple of months.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people seem very excited,&#8221; he said Friday while scouring Detroit&rsquo;s neighborhoods for customers. He drives slowly, just like an ice cream truck driver, and stops when people flag him down. His fruits and vegetables are so popular they sometimes sell out.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got any green tomatoes?&#8221; one man yelled at him on Woodward Avenue in Highland Park. &#8220;No, I already ran out of them,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need a big, old, fat watermelon,&#8221; another man said as he pulled up in his car. &#8220;Sorry,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;I already sold my last watermelon.</p>

		<p>On one hand, it sort of disgusting that government intervention is needed to encourage these people to consume fresh produce.  I mean, they somehow seem to have access to Liquor and Pharmaceuticals&hellip;you know, it&rsquo;s not like Detroit is walled-off like the Warsaw Ghetto (where the Nazis deliberately prevented fresh produce from entering).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if this program can keep Detroit denizens in Detroit, then I totally approve.  Heaven forbid they should move to some white community, or even shop there.  I&rsquo;m sure residents of Hamtranck are thrilled at the prospect of having fewer blacks in their grocery stores.</p>

		<p>This story together with the government&rsquo;s subsidy of people&rsquo;s digital televisions last year makes me think of imperial Rome&rsquo;s bread and circuses.</p>
<p>Years down the road, after the money run out that allows the state to pick up the tab for some groups&rsquo; inability to structure decent societies for themselves, what becomes of these people?  What became of urban Romans when their country faltered?  I would like to know.</p>

		<p>Every time I see something about Detroit I cant help but think about the old John Carpenter movie Escape From New York, where crime got so bad the whole island of Manhattan was walled off and turned into one giant Federal pen.  Very prophetic we should have done this to Detroit years ago.</p>

		<p>Last time i checked the residents of Detroit were not thin, let alone starving and yet the governor wants to hand them tax $ for food delivery, community gardens and - get this- cooking lessons. </p>

		<p>Working at a Radio Shack in Kentucky, I heard about our store in Detroit. Instead of carpet, there was hardwood due to bloodstains. The store had to close an hour before dark every night. Three employees were required to take the deposit to the bank. Eventually that store closed. If someone in Detroit can&rsquo;t find a power inverter anywhere, I don&rsquo;t think it was Radio Shack&rsquo;s fault. </p>

<p> So the blacks take over the Motor City and not only do they not have any food, they have no transportation.</p>

		<p>They did this to themselves by driving out all the grocery stores,.. why must we save them from themselves?  Let &#8216;em starve and shoot them if they try to rob you of yours.  I&rsquo;m tired of bleeding hearts doing for people who won&rsquo;t do for themselves.  Remember the post by the woman who worked in the community garden, only to have these type of people come and steal the fruits of HER labor?   The sooner the lazy and ignorant are eliminated from the gene pool, the better.</p>

		<p>Michigan Gov does this because grocery stores have left.  The reason grocery stores have left is the same reason as all other stores - theft.  Pilferage by employees, rampant shoplifting, and armed robbery inside the store with muggings outside the stores.  Blacks never shop alone.  They always bring their unruly brats, or come in threes or fours.  Why?  So while store employees are distracted by unruly behaviors on the part of some of them, the others are cramming items down blouses, pants, large handbags, even into their hair weaves.  Yes, even meat products go down their pants.  Moreover, it is common for them to open packages and &#8220;snack&#8221; while they cruise, then put the opened boxes back on a shelf somewhere.  As always, blacks are their own worst enemy and the reason nobody wants to deal with them.  </p>

		<p>The &#8220;study&#8221; strikes me as disingenuous.  Percentages of &#8220;food providers&#8221; are meaningless   &mdash;   I bet most residents of Detroit do live withing reasonable distance from stores that sell produce.  I lived in Detroit for seven years and never had any trouble finding it.</p>

		<p>Blacks are like very young baby birds aren&rsquo;t they?  Just sitting helplessly in the nest with their beaks wide open waiting for Mommy and Daddy to feed them.</p>
<p>There are plenty of fresh produce trucks in San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose, Sacramento  and other California cities.  People buy a truck, drive to the nearest farm area, buy the produce and bring it back to the city. They park in a residential neighborhood and people buy their produce which is generally cheaper than supermarkets and allegedly fresher.  At least it was grown within 50 miles, not shipped from the Phillipines or Chile.</p>
<p> No one ever writes about these small businessmen.</p>
<p>But anything to do with blacks needs funding from multiple sources and gushing stories in the papers as if no one had every heard of a produce truck setting up shop before.</p>
<p>When my grandmother was a young housewife, produce trucks came around the neighborhood every 2 days.  She only bought staples and meat at a market.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how a strategically placed &#8220;only&#8221; can take the place of an actual statistical comparison.  A little verbal sleight of hand.  If we don&rsquo;t know the percentages for other areas, these numbers are precisely meaningless.  </p>
<p>I suspect, if you were to add up all the liquor stores, gas stations, party stores, dollar stores, pharmacies and convenience stores in my own very affluent town, they&rsquo;d outnumber supermarkets by 10-1.  Pharmacies alone outnumber them 4-1 at least.  </p>

<p>hmmm, seems to me that the retail demographic is being adequately served, just as the in the Amish community you won&rsquo;t find liquor stores, gas stations, party stores, dollar stores, and convenient stores.</p>

		<p>Of course, the Amish hire drivers or ride their buggies if they need to go to Wal-Mart (the Wally World here even has &#8220;Amish parking&#8221; in the lot), they grow a lot of their own stuff, and generally don&rsquo;t swipe from each other.</p>

		<p>After a few of these drivers are robbed and murdered by the locals, the rest will quit doing business in the area.  This is, after all, precisely the reason the grocery stores left in the first place.</p>
