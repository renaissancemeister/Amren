			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Marx, New Haven (Connecticut) Register, August 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Black intellectuals simply refuse to acknowledge that there is a very obvious connection between themselves and the lawless black underclass.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But, for racial profiling to go away, blacks, especially black intellectuals, need to remove their blinders. They need to see what whites see. They need to see and acknowledge the criminal lifestyle that is pervasive in the black underclass.</p>
<p>Young black men of the ghettoes take pride in carrying guns and have little respect for law. When they go outside their communities, the guns and attitudes are not left behind. In much of their music, they are out front, bragging about their lawlessness.</p>
<p>White people&rsquo;s awareness of that criminal lifestyle creates fear, and that fear, unfortunately, becomes wariness of even law-abiding blacks.</p>
<p>Black crime is the most potent determiner today of white attitudes toward blacks. {snip}</p>
<p>In many cities  &mdash;  New Haven, Hartford, Brooklyn, Baltimore, for instance  &mdash;  major hospitals are located on the edge of neighborhoods populated by the black underclass. When whites who work at the hospitals drive through those neighborhoods, they make sure their windows are up and doors are locked. Walking from the parking lot to the workplace is risky. In e-mails, medical students and hospital staff are informed of robberies and beatings by young black men. They are warned against walking alone.</p>
<p>If it is dangerous to &#8220;drive while black,&#8221; it is even more dangerous to walk while white in some neighborhoods. Driving while black may result in the indignity of a speeding ticket; walking while white could result in a fractured skull.</p>
<p>Staples [Brent Staples, a member of the New York Times editorial board,] has written about his walks near the University of Chicago. It upset him that when white women walking alone noticed him, they would try to avoid him, speeding up or crossing the street. He was befuddled about why a completely innocent black man should be avoided. {snip}</p>
<p>The other day, I was walking down a street and suddenly I saw three young black men coming toward me. My first reaction was &#8220;uh-oh.&#8221; I thought I might be attacked. When I wasn&rsquo;t, I thought how unfair it was to think that.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The American media have bent over backward to avoid identifying criminal perpetrators and suspects by race. But by names, addresses, education and criminal records, people easily jump to conclusions, and they usually are correct. They then generalize.</p>
<p>It may not be logical to do this, but for most people, generalizing comes as easily as eating. This is not fair to law-abiding blacks, but most white people would rather have an unfair thought than risk being hurt.<br>

		<p>The black upper class is just like the white upper class: they know lower class blacks are dangerous, but to others they pretend otherwise and knock those who are open about that knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not be logical to do this, but for most people, generalizing comes as easily as eating.&#8221;  No, it is actually quite logical.  If I can reduce my odds of getting assaulted by simply walking across the street or avoiding certain areas, that is logical. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s more important than even Mr. Marx thinks.  Black crime ultimately defines race relations between blacks and whites.  Black crime repulses and drives out whites, and in turn their leaving and avoidance of black neighborhoods is interpreted by blacks as a sign of racial discrimination.  This heightens black anger towards whites even more, which creates more black on white crime.  On and on.</p>

		<p>&#8220;most white people would rather have an unfair thought than risk being hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they would never utter an &#8216;unfair&#8221; word.  And what is unfair about self-preservation?  And let&rsquo;s be real, we must conduct most of our lives based on generalizations and past experience.  Should a woman wait until raped because crossing the street?</p>

		<p>I have lost count of the articles I have read here on Amren about poor women who were raped and brutalized, men who were beaten or poor souls who were murdered because they did not want to appear &#8220;racist&#8221; and allowed a thuggish looking black man into a condo that was for sale, did not turn around when approached by a large group of black men or simply did not hit the door lock button at a red light in a scary section of the black side of town. When I was a kid in Louisiana in the 1970&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s you simply did not go to the black side of town unless you had a darn good reason to. </p>

		<p>&#8220;BLACK intellectuals just don&rsquo;t get it. They refuse to understand why there is widespread racial profiling and why they and people they know often are its victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>First of all there is no such thing as a black intellectual, with the possible exception of a tiny handful.  Certainly this black dunce who got work as a writer because of AA is abysmally dimwitted if he can&rsquo;t understand that soaring black crime is reason in itself to be wary of blacks in general.  Anyone who isn&rsquo;t is a fool.  And anyone who was approached on the street by by blacks like this writer, then feels guilty when he&rsquo;s not attacked, has got some serious mental problems. </p>
<p>Too he failed to mention that the loud, brutish, unintelligent behavior of blacks makes white people want too avoid them as much as their tremendously high crime rate.  And their constant whining about profiling and other baseless complaints is further reason to steer clear of them.</p>
<p>I have to give Marx credit, however, for even apologetically making small peeping noises supporting the white position, because no other white has the guts to do even that in academia or the MSM.</p>
<p>I never cease to marvel at the general stupidity of blacks, and this account of their lack of reasoning ability to associate black crime with the entire group just re-inforces my studied opinion of their intellectual disabilities.</p>

		<p>This article could have and ought to have been much longer and developed than it is presently.</p>
<p>As for the reflex to avoid blacks, for me it goes back to 1954, when as a two year old, I recall the black kids standing on a balcony of second story apartment behind our home in downtown Sacramento, yelling insults at us that we did not understand.  Later, my mother told me that they were actually trying to urinate down onto us from there.  According to my mother, she went over to talk to their mother and all she got was verbal abuse and a brag that the state was (even then!!) paying her to have more babies.  </p>
<p>My mother tried to raise us to not be racist or anything &#8220;distasteful.&#8221;  It took blacks and their behavior to undo my mother&rsquo;s careful teaching.  </p>
<p>But I especially enjoy the line in the story above that the writer felt he was unfair to fear a group of three blacks coming toward him.  Any convention that forces people to go against their &#8220;gut&#8221; - intuitive wisdom is an evil one.  I guess this guy will attempt to purge himself of such feelings and finally get his own cracked skull, or worse for his idealism.</p>

		<p>&#8220;While the great majority of American blacks are not involved in criminal activity, the criminal lifestyle of young black men makes most whites fearful and suspicious. That is a great injustice, because among middle-class blacks, there is relatively little crime.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When you have at least 80% of a given demographic conforming to a stereotype, you really can&rsquo;t blame anyone for being &#8220;prejudiced.&#8221;  Sure, no one likes to be pre-judged, but when the person doing the pre-judging has a 4 out of 5 chance of being right&hellip;.</p>

		<p>From the link: <i>Paul Marx is professor emeritus of English at the University of New Haven&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Retirement has no doubt freed Prof. Marx to speak his mind, as this is the sort of piece that could lead to summary dismissal from a professorship.  Of course, most Yale professors in New Haven apparently agree with him, as they choose to live in Guilford, Hamden or Fairfield, far from the &#8220;inner city&#8221; neighborhoods which they may never pass through in years of working for the university.  </p>
<p>It is sad, too, because these neighborhoods are still mostly filled with beautiful houses once occupied by middle-class white families.  The state of decay into which they have fallen is heartbreaking.  They could be fine places once again.</p>

		<p>Thank you, AR, for making this article available to your readership.</p>
<p>This is truly a remarkable article, partly because its printed in what we would call an &#8220;MSM&#8221; newspaper. I am frankly surprised it was printed&hellip; the editor probably was sleeping on the job that day. No matter. Printed it was, and the comments are especially interesting. Most readers appear to agree that Blacks are best avoided, based on the FBI&rsquo;s own stats and their own experiences. Its refreshing to see a glimmer of sanity in our PC world. Being Jewish, I am baffled by my fellow Jew&rsquo;s mindless adherence to PC liberalism. Most Jews would argue that the article is racist. It is realist, not racist.</p>

The article itself is of no special interest, only the fact that it was published in New Haven, home of Yale University.</p>

		<p>A surprising number of comments - over half - support what is essentially the AR view (in other words, the truth) about race and crime. I grew up in New Haven so this is no small victory. The New Haven Register is not exactly friendly to dissenting views on race.</p>

		<p>The fact is that I was vacationing in a beach town in 1996. I was one of the few Blacks around. Early one morning about 1:30am I was leaving a bar and heading back to my beach house and suddenly there were four good sized White males following behind me. These guys were at least 6&rsquo;0, 200 lbs probably heavier. I would say they were in their mid 20s. They were talking about David Duke, how America should deport all Blacks to Africa, how they would take care of Jesse Jackson if they ever ran into him, how they had not beaten up anyone in a good while etc&hellip;  they kept getting louder.</p>
<p>Being only 5&rsquo;5, 155 lbs I was scared for my life. I was afraid that they might turn violent. I quickend up my pace without running. As soon as I saw the nearest restaurant that was open I went inside. They look at me from outside for a few minutes and kept on walking. My blood pressure went up from during such an encounter.</p>
<p>My point is that there are White who try to intimidate and terroize Blacks as well. My situation was a case in point.  </p>

		<p> Kudos, Mr. Marx! It&rsquo;s great to hear a college professor (emeritus) speaking good sense, instead of nonsense, for a change about the topic of race. Of course lawless young black men make Whites leery of all black people. I question the statement about the &#8220;overwhelming majority&#8221; of black people being law abiding, but that&rsquo;s a quibble.</p>
<p> What is definitely true is that far too many inner city blacks have returned to savagery, and so shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at the negative reaction they provoke among Whites, toward their whole race.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s surprising that a liberal newspaper would publish this.  At the original site, his article opened a fountain of comments from all sides.  If the liberals want an honest conversation about race, this is a good start.</p>
<p>Notice that the author is a professor emeritus; i.e, he&rsquo;s retired.  No one employed at a university would dare write this article for fear of ending his or her career.   Even tenured professors who dare depart from the orthodox political correctness may find themselves demeaned in the press, their office moved to a basement, and their teaching assignments changed.</p>

		<p>Actually, it is perfectly rational to generalize based on statistically valid differences.  If insurance acturaries didn&rsquo;t do that their companies would go bankrupt.  If may be unfair to a responsible 18 year old male driver that he has to pay high insurance rates, but the fact is that he belongs to a group that is highly prone to get into accidents.  When a taxi driver has a choice of being color blind and dead or being a &#8220;racist&#8221; and living to tell about it, it&rsquo;s no surprise which way he goes.</p>

		<p>Soem good stuff in here, but his conclusion that it&rsquo;s illogical to generalize is simply wrong.  Generalizing is the only way to make decisions in the absence of specific information, and the burden of getting specific information in all circumstances would make life impossible.  Black crime is epidemic, therefore I view blacks as criminals.  The cost of being wrong is nothing to me, but the cost of not generalizing could be fatal.  It&rsquo;s kinda like a reverse Pascal&rsquo;s wager applied to the brotha man. </p>

		<p>As I recall, before government statistics started counting Hispanic criminals as White, the Black homicide rate was over 11 times the White rate.  When the probability that the next Black you see on the street is 11 times as likely to be a killer as the next White, it is entirely rational to avoid Blacks.  </p>

Sure, I believe that blacks and whites should have their own nations, but there&rsquo;s no good reason to intimidate anyone who isn&rsquo;t bothering you.

		<p>Winston, I&rsquo;m sorry that happened to you. How would you like to put up with that kind of thing every time you left the house, though? Those four jerks are the exception to the rule and I think you know it. For the most part, Whites will bend over backwards to not appear racist and to make Blacks feel right at home. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Whites don&rsquo;t come together as a group and rally behind backwards creeps like that when they do commit a crime, making excuses and blaming the victim. No, with few exceptions we rightly ostracize them and hope that they are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. </p>
<p>Here in my rapidly becoming section 8-ed section of California I have to pass numerous groups of loitering Black thugs every day, and they&rsquo;re not the least bit shy about hurling racial epithets, threats, insults, etc. at any White person foolish enough to, well, exist. This isn&rsquo;t even a majority-Black area. Yet. No matter, the cops are too hamstrung by political correctness to so much as politely ask these little racist monsters to move along. I guess White people&rsquo;s blood pressure isn&rsquo;t much of a priority. </p>

		<p>&#8220;White people&rsquo;s awareness of that criminal lifestyle creates fear, and that fear, unfortunately, becomes wariness of even law-abiding blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>   Black intellectuals need to face the reality of high levels of black crime. Some honest black intellectuals have already done so: Juan Williams, Bill Cosby, Thomas Sowell. I give them credit for their fore rightness and truthfulness. Until the black community has an honest wide-ranging internal discussion about this endemic problem, white suspicions and fears about black crime will continue indefinately. I give Mr. Marx credit for his article but I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m optimistic about his future career in today&rsquo;s PC journalism. </p>

		<p>Black intellectuals are the very ones that get it. Mr. Marx is the one who does not get it. Blacks poor or rich, dumb or smart knows that they can keep whitey on the defensive by howling racism at every opportunity. Hey Marx here is a hint. The black intellectual hates you and has no consideration of competeing on a level playing field. He likes it when his fellow street thugs intimidate whites. Quit acting weak and state your case more forcefully. Black intellectuals refuse to recognize black thuggery because it empowers all blacks when dealing with weak minded whites who refuse to face that darkie hates whitey.   </p>

		<p>This is a pretty good article but being in a small town paper it will hardly be noticed. I am positive the so called Black Elite is well aware that this is the crux of the problem (the fear, dislike, and avoidance of black&rsquo;s) they will just never admit it in public or to White&rsquo;s. Many if not most of these elite&rsquo;s are AA but they are not stupid or ignorant. Playing the role of ENABLERS just gives them too much power and juice over society, and I think in many cases a perverse delight in making and watching White&rsquo;s squirm and make fool&rsquo;s of themselve&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip; When whites who work at the hospitals drive through those neighborhoods, they make sure their windows are up and doors are locked. Walking from the parking lot to the workplace is risky. In e-mails, medical students and hospital staff are informed of robberies and beatings by young black men&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>My apologies to Mr. Marx, but there is absolutely no way whatsoever that this last statement is true as he&rsquo;s presented it. No doubt, hospitals do put out warnings concerning criminal thugs. But they do not identify those criminal thugs as &#8220;young black men.&#8221; That is understood, no doubt. But it is not stated. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m to the point where I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re offended. :)</p>
<p>We had a mulatto woman move in our building a few months back and had all these blacks in and out.  My husband and I made sure everything in the carport was locked up and we always made sure our deadbolt was locked.  I would not go into the shared basement to do laundry if hubby wasn&rsquo;t home.</p>
<p>I was relieved when she finally moved out less than two months later&hellip;I felt bad for the landlord because she moved out in the middle of the night (saw the U-Haul outside) and skipped out on the rent, though&hellip;come to find out from a neighbor that she typically stays at a place for a month or so, then skips out on the rent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say to any landlords out there, check those references.  The economy is bad, I can imagine landlords may have a tough time renting and may take whoever has the money  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s worth it to check references.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It may not be logical to do this, but for most people, generalizing comes as easily as eating. This is not fair to law-abiding blacks, but most white people would rather have an unfair thought than risk being hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>I crunched some numbers based on the FBI&rsquo;s stats in &#8216;07 a while back, and came up with this:<br>
- Blacks are 7.6 times more likely to kill someone than whites.<br>
- Blacks are 12.9 times more likely to attack whites than the other way around.</p>
<p>Is it really that illogical to avoid blacks with numbers like these? Acting according to the truth may be politically incorrect to liberals, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it irrational behavior. I can live with accidentally hurting a black pseudo-intellectual&rsquo;s feelings, especially when it protects my livelihood in the far more likely event that the black isn&rsquo;t a pseudo-intellectual.</p>

		<p>Winston&rsquo;s story with large white guys having a conversation about &#8220;David Duke&#8221; and then following him sounds a bit too convenient. The fact is that blacks and browns engage in the pack animal mentality when it comes to attacks far more often than whites, on a severe order of magnitude. Blacks and other non-whites know this, and they also know they can place the race game with the MSM running to their aid generally, either to obfuscate or send things down the memory hole. </p>

The fact is that I was vacationing in a beach town in 1996. I was one of the few Blacks around. Early one morning about 1:30am I was leaving a bar and heading back to my beach house and suddenly there were four good sized White males following behind me. These guys were at least 6&rsquo;0, 200 lbs probably heavier. I would say they were in their mid 20s. </p>
<p>They were talking about David Duke, how America should deport all Blacks to Africa, how they would take care of Jesse Jackson if they ever ran into him, how they had not beaten up anyone in a good while etc&hellip; they kept getting louder.</p>
<p>Hey Winston, I don&rsquo;t believe a word you wrote.  If you had just written that 4 big white guys followed you home from a bar I would have believed you.  If you had written that they called you a n****r I would have believed you.  But your stating that they mentioned David Duke, Jesse Jackson, deportation to Africa, beating up people etc reveals that you made their conservation up.  How could you hear them anyway, unless you were never more that maybe 4 feet away?  You just put too much into your little lying tale.</p>
<p>Black men commit most of the rapes, murders, armed robberies and assaults on Whites in this country.  FBI statistics reveal that 65 percent of interracial crime is black on white.  Your race is the most criminal race in America, Europe, and everywhere else on the planet, even in mainland China.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate for you if you are a law abiding black Winston, but face reality.  I was very pretty when I was young.  I hated being harassed by lecherous men all the time.  But I had to face facts.  Men like to approach pretty young women.  That was the demographic I was born into; female and pretty.  My Mother felt the same way when she was young.  My daughter also hates being harassed by men.  I&rsquo;m sure my granddaughters will also hate it.</p>
<p>Crime statistics show that black men are the most criminal group in America.  If you are a black man, that is your demographic.  You can&rsquo;t blame whites for being afraid of your criminal propensities or through neighborhood watch and other efforts to keep black criminals out of their neighborhoods.<br>

		<p>Winston:  I&rsquo;m 63 years old.  In my life time I have known 11 white men who left a bar by themselves around midnight and were robbed and beaten.</p>
<p>Everyone of them was robbed by a group of 3 or more blacks.  One was stomped on the head.  He was about 27 at the time. 30 Years later he still has brain damage.  He has been disabled ever since that beating by a group of black predators.</p>
<p>And you whine that 4 white men followed you when you left a bar?  Did they rob you? No  Did they Beat you? No  Did they stomp you on the head resulting in a life time of disability? No</p>

<p>I am very sorry that this event occurred to you, but it doesn&rsquo;t change anything&hellip; and I hope I can explain why.</p>
<p>1) Nobody, at least as far as I have seen, is denying that there are Whites who do these things. That&rsquo;s not the issue; the issue is in the statistics regarding interracial crime. In the end, the fact that Whites commit acts like these is the exception to the rule, whereas the fact that Blacks do the same towards Whites IS the rule.</p>
<p>2) The current treatment of race in America is responsible for greatly exacerbating both scenarios.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you have Blacks who have learned that they can (sometimes literally) &#8220;get away with murder&#8221; - simply channeling the specter of &#8220;racism&#8221; automatically gives an edge, and often results in at least a groveling apology. If Whites have such low self-respect, and are willing to wallow in it while offering cash money and an &#8220;untouchable&#8221; status - why not take advantage of the offer?</p>
<p>On the other hand, you have Whites who, by their own eyes have learned the exact same thing. Their response is growing resentment - and even hatred - as they learn daily that the &#8220;benefits of multiculturalism&#8221; represent only costs for them to <br>
pay, NEVER benefits for them to reap, and there&rsquo;s not a damn thing they can do about it. They&rsquo;ll just be marginalized as &#8220;racists&#8221; and Swastika-toting, un-American rednecks - if they&rsquo;re lucky.</p>

		<p>Winston, I am sorry if this truly happened to you but what you say just does not ring true. Any time there is an article like this there are blacks who write comments that they were attacked or threatened by large groups of Whites who were much larger than themselves. While I am sure that there have been instances of blacks being attacked by Whites but for every incident like this there are at least 20 incidents of Whites being attacked and beaten by large groups of blacks. The incident over 4th of July is typical, the police do not rule it as bias related although there were clearly racial remarks being made. If the races had been reversed then there would be news stories all over the place. </p>

I&rsquo;m not saying whites are not fearful of black crime but the point is, healthy whites want to be with their own racial kin.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use the excuse, &#8220;Its because of the crime&#8221; <br>
That&rsquo;s another issue. <br>
Our point IS, we do not want to mix our genetic stock with other races and prefer by instinct the company of our own race.</p>

		<p>To the above white women, I am a white male and have a good number of female friends.  Most all of them told me that not only have they had black men hit on them, but these black guys would be a little aggressive in their pursuits (in such ways white men would be considered criminals or un-gentlemen for doing) and would accuse my lady friends of being &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;once yo&rsquo; black, yo&rsquo; never go back&#8221; nonsense.  That&rsquo;s why most whites don&rsquo;t want black (and hispanic) men dating their daughters.  Yes, it&rsquo;s partly because we think it is unnatural, but mostly because we know that most black men are very aggressive and uncivilized when it comes to pursuing women.  Even most black women would probably agree with me on this.</p>

<p>I worked with an African who said the same thing. I tried to explain how complex the AIDS virus is, and how there is no way it could have been created in the early part of the 20th century, but it seems blacks think white scientists are like gods, and can do anything. The funny thing is, if this tale is to be believed, then seeing as AIDS is spread by sexual promiscuity, the US government was racially stereotyping blacks by assuming this type of disease would kill them off. And by its growth in the black community, these racist scientists have been proved exactly right. Hardly a story blacks should be crowing about if they think it&rsquo;s true.</p>
