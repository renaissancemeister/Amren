<h1>UN Observes International Day of Indigenous People</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Xinhuanet (Beijing), August 11, s009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The United Nations observed on Monday the International Day of the World&rsquo;s Indigenous People with a focus on the threat of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>A commemorating event, organized by the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in cooperation with the NGO Committee on the International Decade of the World&rsquo;s Indigenous Peoples and the New York office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, was held atUN Headquarters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indigenous peoples are more likely to suffer from extreme poverty, geographical isolation, political marginalization, lack of access to adequate health care,&#8221; UnderSecretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Sha Zukang told UN officials and indigenous representatives attending the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of these factors influence the manner of which the HIV/AIDS manifests itself among indigenous peoples,&#8221; Sha said.</p>
<p>He urged member states, the UN system and the international community at large &#8220;not to let the pandemic of HIV/AIDS be yet another area of exclusion and marginalization suffered by the world&rsquo;s indigenous peoples.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a message to mark the day, UN Secratary-Gneral Ban Ki-moon also emphasized the vulnerability of indigenous peoples to HIV/AIDS, noting that, &#8220;it is essential that indigenous peoples have access to the information and infrastructure necessary for detection, treatment and protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>On December 23, 1994, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to designate August 9 the International Day of the World&rsquo;s Indigenous People.<br>

		<p>The horrible way that the indigenous people of the British Ilses and Western Europe should be address by the UN.</p>
<p>Oh, and Mr. Zukang is Chinese.  Now we know how China treats it&rsquo;s indigenous people - flood them with Han to destroy thier societies.</p>

		<p>The UN needs to also hold an International Day for Indigenous Europeans, where disenfranchising through government programs, oppression of traditional cultures and the damage done via drug and prostitution rings in the most white of European regions is focused upon as in need of serious review and curative action.</p>

		<p>It is a werid thing to celebrate, I mean aren&rsquo;t we all &#8220;indigenous&#8221; to some place or another? Do these grim statistics take into account the sucess of the &#8220;indegenous&#8221; people of say Japan or Scandinavia? Or does indigenous only mean pre iron age people who don&rsquo;t wear clothes and live in jungles? If they really just mean primitive, why not just say so?</p>
<p>Oh and do we get to celebrate as the &#8220;indigenous&#8221; peoples of Western Europe?  Or are white people excluded since we were in fact artificially created in a laboratory by the evil scientist Yakub? </p>

		<p>Whites are the indigenous people of Europe.  Let&rsquo;s celebrate them.  Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, we can&rsquo;t do that until our land gets stolen from us by outsiders.  That&rsquo;s why we have so many liberal White Quisling politicians in Europe, they so admire oppressed indigenous people that they&rsquo;re trying to become them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indigenous peoples&#8221; are no more vulnerable to HIV than anyone else. One usually gets HIV from sex or IV drug use, though a few are born with it or accidentally get it ie. health care workers etc. It&rsquo;s very simple how you get it.</p>

		<p>From Dictionary.com: &#8220;in⋅dig⋅e⋅nous –adjective originating in and characteristic of a particular region or country; native&#8221;</p>
<p>From the UN press release: &#8220;(New York, 6 August) In commemoration of the International Day of the World&rsquo;s Indigenous People (9 August), an observance at UN Headquarters on Friday, 8 August will focus on efforts by indigenous peoples and States to foster reconciliation.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s have some recognition of the indigenous people of Europe. And let&rsquo;s have some reconciliation. Tell you where we should start - how about Muslims apologize for attempting to take over Europe in the Middle Ages, leading to the Crusades. How about Middle Eastern, African, and Asian people voluntarily relinquish any attempt to control European society with sharia law or any other such nonsense. How about alien people apologize to Europeans for increasing crime and lawlessness? After all, Europeans are indigenous to Europe. Where&rsquo;s the reconciliation?</p>

		<p>AIDS research definitely needs greater funding. How those little bugs can seek out and find indigenous natives for prey is a marvel. Lets not dwell on the obvious, however. Lets delve right in to what it is exactly that makes them so racist and filled with malice. </p>

		<p>You can really see a double standard between how white people and indigenous people are defined. It&rsquo;s always said that the white race is a social construction. We&rsquo;re asked to explain whether 1/2 or 1/4 white mixtures are still white and whether Afghanis or Egyptians are white. On the other hand indigenous people are not confronted with these kinds of exceptions. It&rsquo;s just assumed that the indigenous category is socially meaningful and the exceptions are mostly irrelevant. Whites are not given the same leniency.</p>

<i>&ldquo;Indigenous peoples are more likely to suffer from extreme poverty, geographical isolation, political marginalization, lack of access to adequate health care,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The term &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; sounds like the politically correct term to define low-IQ minorities who are their own victims and maginalized because of their own low-IQs and therefore can&rsquo;t raise their standards without money and aid from others.</p>

		<p>If the U.N. has a special day for you - then you are NOT politically marginalized.  It is forbidden to bring up the plight of indigenous Europeans and doing so will get you thrown in prison in some countries.  Now THAT, my friends, is marginalization.</p>

<p>I wonder just how they have rigged the definition of that term?  Would not the native peoples of Europe qualify for such concern?  Not likely though. I wonder how they manage to jiggle that term, what sophistry they use, to exclude whites?   </p>

		<p>While i agree with most of these comments about WE Europeans being indegenous to Europe, i also must agree that after so many generations the inhabitants of The US are indigenous as well. So, based on that premise let&rsquo;s return DIEGO GARCIA island to the indegenous inhabitants who were abusibely expelled and put through genocidal suffering. Also, the UN is trying to bring attention to the ones in worse condition than we are. The reasons behind it are irrelevant, they are behind and we should give them a hand. </p>

<p>Yet you see people who are obviously White (and who must hate their own race) saying that they are really (fill in blank with other race) because one great grandparent was Asian, Native American or something else. You know that this is just a ploy to gain acceptance from the multicultural crowd and it usually works. No longer is the person just a plain vanilla White person, they automatically become a magical &#8220;person of COLOR&#8221; and are entitled to all of the benefits of being such. Case in point are the Indian cards handed out in my home state of Oklahoma, many of the recipients are blond haired, blue eyed obviously White people who managed to have an ancestor on the Indian rolls and are entitled to Indian benefits such as free health care, reduced rates on license tags (a big controversy) and other benefits. Many genuine Indians do not have these because the person responsible did not get on the rolls at that time. They may be full blood but they do not get any benefits because they are not listed on some arbitrary list created in the 19th century. </p>

<p>I wonder if there is a minimum amount of time before a people becomes indigenous or does one have to wipe out the natives to become the new natives? For example Maori arrived in New Zealand some time between 800 and 1300AD, proceeded to kill, enslave and eat all the people living there called &#8216;Moriori&rsquo;, a pacifist people who refused to defend themselves, till the Maori people were the only ones who remained. They are now the &#8220;indigenous people&#8221; of New Zealand and claim special status.</p>
