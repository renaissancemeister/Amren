			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Shears, Daily Mail (London), August 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of police swooped on suspected terrorists in Melbourne early today amid fears suicide attacks were about to be launched on army bases in Australia.</p>
<p>Police from around the country were quietly moved to Melbourne before launching their raids on homes in at least seven suburbs.</p>
<p>Several men of Somali and Lebanese backgrounds were arrested and were expected to appear in court later on terrorism-related charges.</p>
<p>Police sources said it would be claimed the men were planning to attack a barracks in western Sydney and other defence bases in Victoria.</p>
<p>The suspected terrorists were said to be plotting to force their way into the bases to kill as many soldiers as possible before turning guns on themselves.</p>
<p>The arrested men are believed to have links to al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>Sources said electronic surveillance on the suspects had picked up conversations about ways to obtain weapons to carry out what would be the worst terror attack on Australian soil.</p>
<p>The arrested men are said to be construction workers and taxi drivers living in Melbourne, but have Islamic backgrounds.</p>
<p>It is understood several men from the alleged terrorist cell have travelled to Somalia to train in the use of weapons with the terrorist movement al-Shabaab.</p>
<p>Al-Shabaab has been training suicide bombers and jihadist fighters in the hope of overthrowing the Somali government.</p>
<p>The organisation&rsquo;s aim is to impose a hardline form of Islam and regards the West as its enemy.</p>
<p>It has links with al-Qaeda, including the prominent figure Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, who is said to be behind the 1998 attacks on the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, when more than 200 people were killed.</p>
<p>Investigations into the Melbourne cell are believed to have started earlier this year  &mdash;  before today&rsquo;s dramatic raids around the city.</p>
<p>According to police sources several members of the group wanted to travel to Somalia to fight with al-Shabaab, but when they found difficulty in obtaining visas they turned their attention to launching terror attacks in Australia.</p>
<p>At one of the homes, which police spent several hours searching, a forensic tent was set up in the garden, allowing officers to inspect items that had been allegedly found on the property.</p>
<p>More than 400 police from the Australian Federal Police and forces in Victoria, New South Wales, the NSW Crime Commission and the Australian Securitjy Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) were involved in the dramatic raids.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Victoria Police said there had been &#8216;a number of arrests&rsquo; but declined to say how many.</p>
<p>The raids were carried out under the name Operation Health.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the terrorist operation was emphasised by senior police early today with claims that the alleged jihadists were planning to burst into army bases with semi-automatic weapons blazing.</p>
<p>They intended to kill as many defence force personnel as possible before turning the weapons on themselves  &mdash;  if they were not first killed by soldiers.</p>
<p>Australian Federal Police acting Chief Commissioner Tony Negus said early today that if the alleged plot had been carried out, it would have been the most serious terrorist act ever on Australian soil.</p>
<p>Four people, all Australian citizens of either Lebanese or Somalian backgrounds, had been arrested.</p>
<p>Police have begun interviewing two men aged 25, a 26-year-old old and a 22-year-old.</p>
<p>These are the same age ranges as suicide bombers who have committed atrocities in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Mr Negus said it was possible that further arrests could follow.</p>
<p>While the Holsworthy base in Sydney was an alleged target, there had been &#8216;suspicious activity&rsquo; around other bases, said Mr Negus.</p>
<p>Allegations related specifically to an attack with firearms, not bombs, he said, adding: &#8216;We believe these men were affiliated with a group called al-Shabaab in Somalia.</p>
<p>&#8216;We were satisfied the timing (of the raids) was right  &mdash;  obvioiusly the primary concern is public safety,&rsquo; said Mr Negus.<br>

		<p>Here are a few comments (chosen from dozens, all in the same style) from the AussieMuslims blog (looks as if there are no guilty Muslims, eh? Our federal police obviously have nothing better to do than persecute the innocent, just cos they&rsquo;re Muslims, lol):</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you even know it&rsquo;s true? Subhanillah it could be some of our friends or their families who could have been wrongly arrested. We don&rsquo;t know until we speak directly with the people involved. You can&rsquo;t trust the media, and you can&rsquo;t trust that everything that is said in regards to &#8216;terrorists&rsquo; by the Governement is true either.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
&lsquo;no doubt as this becomes clearer huge holes will begin to appear in the official story. but i guess some are just happy to believe claims of the kuffaar before verifying the truth despite the many that have exposed them as the liars they are&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
&lsquo;If they are innocent, then allahmdulilah they will be given the public forum where their innocence can be widely broadcast.</p>
<p>their and their families lives destroyed after years behind bars, in solitary confinement. presumption of guilt before innocences. and when finally released its the attitude that they are only free because to them the laws aren&rsquo;t up to scratch or the right evidence just hasn&rsquo;t been found.&rsquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lsquo;Make dua for these brothers and remember them in your prayers.&rsquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lsquo;yeah previous cases with dubious witnesses, entrapment, heresay and so-called coded messages and guilt by association.&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
&lsquo;Invesitgate the case of brother Faheem Lodhi a bit and you will see that he was senteced to 20 years in jail based on circumstantial evidence. If you analyse the cases of brothers in the UK and US, the trend is becoming very clear. The identify those with &#8216;the mentality&rsquo; and then try to fit a case on them. You&rsquo;d be quite naive/foolish to believe that as a Muslim, we are guaranteed the same presumption of innocence as an average person.&rsquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the hate the western world has on us they want us lock up with no freedom it was army base why is it called terrorist attack when the Aussie troops have been raping, killing innocent Muslims for years we are intitle to defend outselfs&rsquo; (news to me - )</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
&lsquo;Who can trust the Federal Police after Mohammed Haneef, Faheem Lodhi, Bilaal Khazzal, etc. Dont forget that a schizophrenic liar was the star witness in Abu Bakr&rsquo;s trial. Christian jury found him guilty.&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
&lsquo;In this country we can&rsquo;t trust NOBODY The Australian Government is Corrupted Full bias they want us lock-up like the did to David hicks Remember him?&rsquo; (I think he means Mohammed Dawood, the traitor and would be jihadist) </p>
<p></p>
<p>&lsquo;Regardless if they were actually planning something or not, the way the police treats them is really aggressive and it deprives them of their human rights they&rsquo;ve flipped the presumption of innocence completely, they detain them without charge, and God knows what else goes on. I can&rsquo;t support what the government is doing even if they do have real evidence there&rsquo;s another way to approach this this way they just fuel more anger towards the authorities, we&rsquo;re angry, we feel the government is biased and unfair what the government is doing to counter terrorism is counter-productive anti-terror laws are criticised by many people, academics, journalists, muslims, non-muslims, human rights orgs etc&hellip;. why are some of us muslims defending the operations&rsquo;</p>
<p>Etc etc etc, blah blah blah. Should wake up a few sleeping Aussie fools&hellip;</p>

		<p>As I stated in a previous post the chickens are really coming<br>
(or maybe flying) home to roost.Since the end of the white Australia policy and the dramatic increase of African immigration since the  90s it was inevitable this was going to happen.<br>
  I am reading the local papers here today which are trying to paint some of these Somali terrorists as being `victims`<br>
You know the usual story about being a good boy in school with excellent marks (!) who fell in to the `wrong  crowd` in his teens and whose beloved uncle was prevented by social workers and police from saving him from&hellip;. himself &hellip;I presume      </p>
<p>  I think this will thankfully cause a backlash as a lot of outraged Aussies question the wisdom of our politicians and <br>
their liberal lackeys in letting this potential catastophic  situation occur&hellip;Aussie military guys were very close to being slaughtered in their own bases by these Muslim fanatics.<br>
Yet we are told that 99.99 % of these people living here are<br>
peaceful folk wanting to get on with their lives which is<br>
arrant nonsense.Its quite obvious a lot of these Muslims sympathize with extremist causes even if their not the ones putting on the ammo belts and semiautomatic assault rifle   <br>
 I tended to think we had escaped  a lot of the racial/religious issues plaguing the US and Europe&hellip;it would be indeed a sad day if I started questioning how safe it was for my family to continually to live in a safe `terror free`<br>
environment.       </p>

		<p>I remember Katie Couric gushing during the Olympics about how wonderful it was that Australia had become diverse, implying that it was evil in the past when it had a &#8220;Whites only&#8221; immigration policy. During the 70s, it was considering moving there, but changed my mind when I saw how the winds were blowing.</p>

		<p>I commented before that while I was in Viet-Nam, I was not allowed to go to Australia for R&R; because the Australian government wouldn&rsquo;t allow blacks to get off the aircraft&hellip;bet they&rsquo;re sorry now that they allowed themselves to be PC&rsquo;d into allowing blacks, muslims and &#8220;others&#8221; into the country.</p>
