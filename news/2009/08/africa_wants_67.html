			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tsegaye Tadesse, Reuters, August 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African leaders will ask rich nations for $67 billion per year to mitigate the impact of global warming on the world&rsquo;s poorest continent, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>Ten leaders are holding talks at African Union (AU) headquarters in the Ethiopian capital to try to agree a common stance ahead of a U.N. summit on climate change in Copenhagen in December.</p>
<p>Experts say Africa contributes little to the pollution blamed for warming, but is likely to be hit hardest by the droughts, floods, heatwaves and rising sea levels forecast if climate change is not checked.</p>
<p>The draft resolution, which must still be approved by the 10 leaders, called for rich countries to pay $67 billion annually to counter the impact of global warming in Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CALLS FOR COMPENSATION</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi called on rich countries to compensate Africa for warming, arguing that pollution in the northern hemisphere may have caused his country&rsquo;s ruinous famines in the 1980s.</p>
<p>A study commissioned by the Geneva-based Global Humanitarian Forum that was released in May said poor nations bear more than nine-tenths of the human and economic burden of climate change.</p>
<p>The 50 poorest countries, however, contribute less than 1 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions that scientists say are threatening the planet, the report said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Developing nations accuse the rich of failing to take the lead in setting deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, and say they are trying to get the poor to shoulder more of the burden of emission curbs without providing aid and technology.</p>

		<p>How much of this $67 billion actually be used to mitigate Glo-Bull Warming?  </p>
<p>While it is true that the average black African has very little carbon output, the reason for that is because they don&rsquo;t have much in the way of economic resources.  If they did, their pollution would be significantly higher per capita than the average white person.</p>
<p>The reason I can say this is that it has already been proven   &mdash;   look at the way many black Americans waste energy.  &#8220;Hooptee&#8221; cars that have no maintenance for fuel efficiency or otherwise, 1000-watt subwoofers and chrome retro-spinning wheels, which decreased fuel economy because they&rsquo;re powered by gas when the car is running (If you have ever forgotten to turn off your headlights after turning the engine off for the night, you know what I mean.)  Yanking the gas thermostat in winter to very high temperatures.  The aggregate marginal increase of natural gas usage caused by such people being so wasteful increases demand on the natural gas market, which raises the price for everyone, including for elderly white women on fixed income that keep the thermostat lower than they really should.  I could go on and on.</p>

<p>Hardly, just more of the same. </p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me, how blacks the whole world over, never take responsibility for their own dysfunctions and shortcomings. It is always the fault of others, that see them destroying everything they touch, including themselves! If only they could put the same amount of thought and energy into developing their own &ldquo;aid and technology,&rdquo; as they do in excusing their own perfidiousness and endemic incompetence, and seeking freebies, they would likely be masters of the earth.</p>

		<p>Why bother? We all know that at least 60 billion of that money will go into the pockets of corrupt government officials, the proclaimed effects of global warming won&rsquo;t be mitigated in the least, and the poor will continue to suffer the most. Just another excuse to squeeze white contries for more money, by trying to blame their lot in life on somebody else instead of blaming themselves for being the architects of their own misery.</p>

		<p>Since global warming has been blamed on greenhouse gasses and methane is a greater threat than carbon-dioxide, and cattle in the White West contribute most of our share of this gas in the form of belches and farts, it only stands to reason that the millions of ruminants on constant migration all over africa contribute far, far more. Therefore it would appear that africa actually owes the White West a substantial tribute in the form of Global Warming Compensation, and not the other way round.</p>

		<p>See the book &#8220;Dead Aid&#8221;. Government to government aid to Africa is only a stupid way to transfer wealth from Western nations, struggling with their deep recessions, to Swiss bank accounts of the African power elite. These African power elite, always well versed in the noble words the naive West wants to hear, will always connive a way to enrich mainly themselves while lying through their smiles or through their phony indignation at being given too little.</p>

		<p>Time was when carbon dioxide was to blame for global warming but now it&rsquo;s cattle which are belching and farting lethal doses of methane. It is also claimed that black africans are starving because valuable land and water resources are used to grow bio-fuel crops and animal feed for export to the White west. I  expect the various african government departments have noticed this huge export market and have not failed to extract the maximum amount of duties and licence fees for their own personal benefit rather than put the land to better use feeding their own hungry populations.  Beef cattle in Yorkshire graze solely on our verdant English upland pastures which are unsuitable for food production, not even for starving africans. We also eat this delicious home grown meat product without affecting africans. Considering that millions of ruminants are in a constant state of migration all over africa, it is obvious that africa owes the White West compensation for africa&rsquo;s own massive methane contribution to global warming. Add this to the exhaust fumes from the multitude of 4x4 vehicles bought by black african government ministers paid for by international aid and the African Union should re-think their agenda and stop producing totally unwarranted amounts of damaging hot air.  </p>

<p>Oho!  So it&rsquo;s not just $67 billion that they want in one lump sum, but $67 billion <b>ANNUALLY!  </b></p>
<p>$67 billion for something that&rsquo;s not (yet) even a proven scientific fact.<br/>
 <br/>
When will this brazen mooching ever stop?  Apparently never. Once they get accustomed to this massive influx of money, they well need it forever more.  Africa, as we see once again, is just a bottomless pit that can never be satisfied. </p>

		<p>The majority of all monetary aid send to African despots is forwarded by said despots to the secret numbered bank accounts of the World Bank and IMF banksters who in turn eventually &#8220;forgive&#8221; the unpaid &#8220;loans&#8221;.  This scam has been perpetuated for decades.</p>
<p>And sending &#8220;food aid&#8221; to black Africans only serves to exasperate their problems by ensuring the continued survival of a people who perpetuate their own impoverishment via gross overpopulation.  This lunacy too has been going on for decades and now that population overflow is betaking Europe and America and must be stopped&hellip;</p>

		<p>As some one who lived in South Africa for 24 years until we escaped in 1999 from tHe new held out begging bowls.    They have one nuclear power station which has been broken down most of the time as they got rid of the white African technicians and managers, but the main point is that all Africans, even those living in luxury houses produce massive amounts of CO2 with their coal and wood fired coooking fires and heating facilities  producing  so much that in some areas it is difficult to breathe   I forecast a year ago that this is what would happen.  All we need to do is prove that the global warming in the past was BEFORE the excessive CO2 production, not the other way around as has been announced by scientists from the evidence of ice cores drilled out in the Artic Circle.  No more AID for Africa.  Do them a big favour from now.  Make them work and earn their 21st Century lives.  That is why they murdered the African whites especially in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe and South Africa.   NO MORE AID.<br/>

		<p>I see something far more ominous here, than just the certainty that the 67 billion will do straight into the Swiss bank accounts of Africa&rsquo;s dictators.</p>
<p>I see this as an excuse to finally implement direct UN taxation of the so-called rich countries&rsquo; citizenry.  Maybe this impending taxation is why the UN feels it needs the GPS coordinates of all our front doors.</p>
<p>But as to the claim that Africans contribute little to global warming, I say POOH!  I set the grade curve in college Ecology, and again, in Environmental Concerns.  Back then, before cringing before the Idols of diversity had become the primary goal of academics, we were taught that third-world agricultural practices and cooking fires were as much to blame for the Carbon problem as was the burning of fossil fuels by Advanced societies.</p>
<p>The problem boils down to TOO MUCH HUMAN BIOMASS and TOO LITTLE PLANT MASS.  Humans consume oxygen, but produce Carbon Dioxide and Methane.  Guess who produces the most new babies?  Not Western Whites, for sure.  And guess what portion of the world&rsquo;s population is loathe to plant trees?  Not Scandinavians, whose homeland has become heavily reforested during the last century or so.</p>
<p>Third-worlders detest plantlife.  First-worlders CRAVE plantlife.  Carbon is stored in plants.  Ignorant third-worlders who practice slash-and-burn agriculture, and who fail to plant trees, are preventing carbon from being re-stored inside plant materials.</p>
<p>Yes, I consume fossil fuels.  But in the last two years, I&rsquo;ve also added over 200 woody plants to my quarter-acre, including twenty new trees and fifteen clumps of Bamboo.  So my &#8216;Carbon Footprint&rsquo; may possibly be smaller than that of some African with eight children and a swept-earth yard.  Maybe the Africans should be sending ME some money&hellip;</p>

		<p>I guess I look at this different than most everyone here. But, If I could call someone a boo-boo head and then get paid by that boo-boo head to not say it again&hellip;well.. after I spent the money I think I would find the idiot and call him a boo-boo head again. If it worked a second time as soon as I was out of his presence I would laugh my *** off.After I ran this scam for 50 years and the numbers got bigger&hellip;. I would ask(no tell) Boo-Boo head to give me an enourmous amount of money.And laugh my head off (remember I already laughed the other end off) if he paid it.   <br/>
That is what the White Elite never understad because they know no one is capable of playing them for a fool.HAHAHAHAH<br/>
They never understand that the Black leaders of Africa scratch their head wondering how such an advanced people can be so idiotic.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ll love this one: </p>
<p>To make a long story short: a while ago, two Norwegians travelling in Congo were charged of killing their black driver in the middle of a jungle in Congo. A couple of weeks ago, the trial begun. It has all the way been a huge mixture of actual proof, fabricated proof and hillarious claims, regardless of the two guys being guilty or not.</p>
<p>This has been the top story in the Norwegian press the last couple of weeks. Today, the trial entered it&rsquo;s final phase. Today, the real circus begun.</p>
<p>Because the two men suspected of killing the poor driver have earlier served in the Norwegian national guard, the republic of Congo now sues the kingdom of Norway for no less than $500 billion dollars(!) (The GDP of Congo is $8,26 billion).</p>
<p>So&hellip; Is there any chance we could borrow some cash from the US to bail us out of this trouble?</p>
