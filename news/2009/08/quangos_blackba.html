<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It could be construed as a black day for the English language  &mdash;  but not if you work in the public sector.</p>
<p>Dozens of quangos [quasi-non-governmental organizations] and taxpayer-funded organisations have ordered a purge of common words and phrases so as not to cause offence.</p>
<p>Among the everyday sayings that have been quietly dropped in a bid to stamp out racism and sexism are &#8220;whiter than white&#8221;, &#8220;gentleman&rsquo;s agreement&#8221;, &#8220;black mark&#8221; and &#8220;right-hand man&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has advised staff to replace the phrase &#8220;black day&#8221; with &#8220;miserable day&#8221;, according to documents released under freedom of information rules.</p>
<p>It points out that certain words carry with them a &#8220;hierarchical valuation of skin colour&#8221;. The commission even urges employees to be mindful of the term &#8220;ethnic minority&#8221; because it can imply &#8220;something smaller and less important&#8221;.</p>
<p>The National Gallery in London believes that the phrase &#8220;gentleman&rsquo;s agreement&#8221; is potentially offensive to women and suggests that staff should replace it with &#8220;unwritten agreement&#8221; or &#8220;an agreement based on trust&#8221; instead. The term &#8220;right-hand man&#8221; is also considered taboo by the gallery, with &#8220;second in command&#8221; being deemed more suitable.</p>
<p>Many institutions have urged their workforce to be mindful of &#8220;gender bias&#8221; in language. The Learning and Skills Council wants staff to &#8220;perfect&#8221; their brief rather than &#8220;master&#8221; it, while the Newcastle University has singled out the phrase &#8220;master bedroom&#8221; as being problematic.</p>
<p>Advice issued by the South West Regional Development Agency states: &#8220;Terms such as &#8216;black sheep of the family&rsquo;, &#8216;black looks&rsquo; and &#8216;black mark&rsquo; have no direct link to skin colour but potentially serve to reinforce a negative view of all things black. Equally, certain terms imply a negative image of &#8216;black&rsquo; by reinforcing the positive aspects of white.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, in the context of being above suspicion, the phrase &#8216;whiter than white&rsquo; is often used. Purer than pure or cleaner than clean are alternatives which do not infer that anything other than white should be regarded with suspicion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clampdown in the public sector has angered some of the country&rsquo;s most popular writers.</p>
<p>Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider children&rsquo;s spy books, said: &#8220;A great deal of our modern language is based on traditions which have now gone but it would be silly  &mdash;  and extremely inconvenient  &mdash;  to replace them all. A &#8216;white collar worker&rsquo;, for example, probably doesn&rsquo;t wear one. An &#8216;able seaman&rsquo;, under new regulations, could well be neither. &#8216;Spanish practices&rsquo; can happen all over Europe. We know what these phrases mean and we can find out from where they were derived. Banning them is just unnecessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marie Clair, spokeswoman for the Plain English Campaign, said: &#8220;Political correctness has good intentions but things can be taken to an extreme. What is really needed is a bit of common sense.&#8221;<br>

		<p> Seems ridiculous of course. Then I remembered my concealed handgun class. When I asked the instructor &#8220;Hoot&#8221;  about knowing the moment to brandish a handgun he replied, &#8220;Let`s get that word out of our vocabulary right now! Brandish means to wave about in a hostile, reckless and aggressive manner. We &#8220;produce&#8221; or &#8220;display&#8221; the weapon&hellip;</p>

		<p>Oh, I can just imagine and look forward to the humor this article will provoke in the comments!  I have my own sweepingly absurd proposal that is nonetheless consonant with the idiotic logic of these &#8220;anti-racists&#8221;: why not ban use of the words &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; altogether in any government publication?  &#8220;Black&#8221; has obviously been so tainted by &#8220;racist&#8221; usage, and &#8220;white&#8221; so &#8220;privileged,&#8221; that their continued circulation will only promote, and hence implicitly constitute an endorsement by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government of, the persistence of the thought crimes against &#8220;diversity&#8221; which &#8220;the Great and the Good&#8221; in Britain have pledged the lives, the fortunes and the sacred honor of their fellow citizens to eradicating.   </p>

		<p>I cringe at what Britain is becoming these days. They are told to jump by their immigrant community, then ask in return, How high? It&rsquo;s really no surprise why their immigrants are so nasty, rude, and anti-white, when whites give them full permission to roll right over them. I have seen countless Blacks posting anti-white messages online from the UK, and many of them are vile. Most are immigrants from either Africa or the Caribbean, and are living comfortably off British taxpayers dollars, yet spew nothing but venom, for indigenous white Brits, and whites in general. They also like to boast about how eager they feel most Brits are to &#8220;mix it up with them&#8221; finding black men and women irresistible. They are well used to trashing whites, and happily exercise their freedom of expression, but love the fact that white Brits do not have the same luxury.  </p>

		<p>Do these people sit around trying to find anything at all that might be to someone somewhere at sometime offensive.  I can not even imagine that the vast majority of blacks and browns take notice of common English expressions.  These ninnies no doubt fail to see just how &#8220;1984&#8221; they are.</p>
<p>By the way, a &#8220;right-hand man&#8221; is not necessarily a second in command but is more likely to be someone&rsquo;s most important and closest advisor/confidant.  Sort of like a girl friday&hellip;.ooops, shouldn&rsquo;t say that either! </p>
<p>And gender bias in language - that term has butchered the language with (s)he and him/her.  When I was in grade school we were taught that when referring to both males and females to use the masculine pronoun.  That the masculine was used either to refer to men or people, depending on context.  Like &#8220;mankind&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oh, and who decided to replace the term &#8220;sex&#8221; when referring to one&rsquo;s sex (male or female) with &#8220;gender&#8221;.  Gender means masculine or feminine not male or female.  We refer to boats as shes but that doesn&rsquo;t mean a boat is female.  And you can be a woman but not necessarily feminine.  I suppose that was to satisfy the transgender people.  We are we headed?<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe people this simple-minded are given amy press at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the policy of the big corps here to outlaw employees from referring to &#8220;wives&#8221; or &#8220;husbands&#8221; for fear of offending any gays who might be around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also like some corporate dunderhead who makes some silly policy than defends it by saying his intention is to prevent lawsuits, forgetting that the particular policy will bring just a many lawsuits for invoking it.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it just absolutely great to see so many of them hurting economically or going under altogether?  </p>

		<p>They ARE going nuts there in Britain!</p>
<p>It is also true that LA County, California asked computer suppliers to stop using the terms &#8220;master&#8221; and &#8220;slave&#8221; in 2003 (source: CNN - https://tinyurl.com/2uhr8).  Dunno what ever came of that, but one can only hope the nut (Joe Sandoval) who came up with it was &#8220;replaced&#8221;.  (Who am I kidding&hellip;that was in California&hellip;he probably got promoted.)</p>

<p>One wonders why: Idiot, Fool, Jackass, Moron, Buffoon, Cretin, Imbecile, Nitwit, Feckless, Wretch, Freak, Lazy, and of course Traitor, have also not been purged as well? After all, do not these words aptly and painfully describe most bureaucrats and politicians? </p>

		<p>I have two problems with this. First is simply the evisceration of the English language, in this case for ideological reasons. Imagine Churchill&rsquo;s immortal statement that &#8220;if the British Empire should last a thousand years, men will still say, &#8216;this was their finest hour&rsquo;&#8221; being rewritten to accommodate feminism.</p>
<p> Second is the distortion of meaning that inevitably accompanies these kinds of linguistic purges. A prime example might be the airline industry&rsquo;s replacement of &#8220;steward&#8221; and &#8220;stewardess&#8221; by &#8220;flight attendant&#8221;. A steward is held responsible for the well being of the persons or things under his stewardship, i.e., there is a moral and professional component to the position. A &#8220;flight attendant&#8221;, by contrast, may do nothing more than pass out drinks or peanuts during the flight. Many of the examples given in the article will likely make it impossible to communicate clearly, or eloquently.</p>
<p>But maybe this is just what is desired.</p>

<p>Stop right there.  I know what is needed, if your pockets <br>
are deep enough. </p>
<p>1. Find exactly who is in charge of these organizations. In fact, TARGET THE MAIN LEADER OF THE GROUP (&#8220;Strike the shepherd <br>
and the SHEEP WILL SCATTER&#8221;).  <br>
2. Covertly lobby your government (on behalf of your church <br>
perhaps) to get rid of their funding.<br>
3. File a class action lawsuit that says these rules challenge <br>
freedom of expression.<br>
4. Let the legal bills drive this person to bankruptcy; <br>
or&hellip;<br>
5. Find out how to have them deported. </p>

		<p>You write &#8216;Britain going nuttier than ever&rsquo;, but actually politically correct speech (ie the notion that thought can be changed by changing &#8216;charged&rsquo; words), is an American invention, coming from the remnants of the American &#8216;radical left&rsquo; only to be lapped up some rather silly British people who hold high office.<br>
Such verebal abominations as &#8216;fire-fighter&rsquo; (put for fireman) and &#8216;letter-carrier&rsquo; (ie postman) are purely Americanisms that the trendy British media seized upon.<br>
 The first time I heard the word &#8216;fire-fighter&rsquo; on a TV news bulletin perhaps 30 years ago I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the word meant - it was never, ever used nor heard before in England.The word &#8216;fireman&rsquo; was always used exclusively.</p>

		<p>For many years, graffiti on a bridge over a major road leading into central London proclaimed &#8216;Women Rule!&rsquo;. The entire bridge was re-painted two days following the addition of the words &#8216;in the kitchen&rsquo;. The owner of our local hardware shop was castigated for advertising &#8216;Ball Cocks&rsquo; for only £15 each and instructed by the P.C. Local Authority to re-phrase the advert. He amended this offensive wording to read &#8216;Ball Cocks only £15, water tank flotation valves £115.&rsquo; The terms &#8216;cracker&rsquo; and &#8216;honky&rsquo; are not recognised as racial insults in UK and, in any case, blacks here are from the Caribbean or Africa and don&rsquo;t usually use Afro-American terminology unless it is gleaned from rap lyrics. &#8216;The Wire&rsquo; is an excellent programme from which to learn black street language and the average 100 word vocabulary requisite to follow the plot. The racist slurs used by blacks to other blacks in this programme is astounding but explains why they are so violent and uncivilised. The recent formation of the Nigerian Natural Gas Company and given the acronym NIGAS by the government there raised no protest at all as the word means nothing in africa. As far as I am aware, repair facilities in UK still fit Master and Slave hydraulic brake devices to vehicles and Black Monday refers to a financial disaster although to have a bank account in the &#8216;black&rsquo; is considered good! </p>

		<p>In my linguistics classes in college, one text gave an illustration of how meanings could be sanitized by substituting words and phrases. During the Spanish civil war of the 1930&rsquo;s, the German Nazi party ordered the news media to refer to Franco&rsquo;s regime as &#8220;the Spanish national government&rsquo;, and the opposition as &#8220;Bolshevik forces&#8221;.</p>
<p>Who knew that Britain would one day be aping the Nazis, in the end? Is this what so many in the RAF were owed?</p>
