			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner, August 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About a week ago, the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee defeated an amendment which would have excluded illegal aliens from Obama&rsquo;s massive healthcare bill. In addition to replacing our private healthcare system with a government-run program, many have argued that this bill is in fact, a &#8216;backdoor&rsquo; amnesty.</p>
<p>The Democratically-controlled committee voted 23-18 to defeat the measure introduced by Rep. Dean Heller (R-NV), which would have required the use of the existing Income and Eligibility Verification System and the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements System, before any care is given. This move would have ensured that only U.S. citizens would receive the taxpayer funded care.</p>
<p>While Obama has made claims that illegal aliens will not be covered by his plan, the following line can be found among the 1018 page bill: Sec. 59B, Pg. 170, Line 1  &mdash;  &#8220;Any NONRESIDENT alien is exempt from individual taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Judicial Watch&rsquo;s president Tom Fitton recently reported that Mexico directs their citizens who live in the U.S. illegally, to use taxpayer funded clinics in a dozen cities. The program is called Ventanillas de Salud (Health Windows), and is implemented in American cities which have Mexican consulates.</p>
<p>The government of Mexico has operated the program for some time. In 2007, Fitton wrote the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego and Indiana are among the cities where Mexican consulates operate the health referral system which annually costs U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars. In Los Angeles County alone, illegal immigrants cost taxpayers nearly $440 million in health services annually and a whopping $1.1 billion statewide.</p>
<p>The Mexican consul in Los Angeles proudly announced that nearly 300,000 Mexicans in the area have benefited from his government&rsquo;s health referral program, which he says actually saves the county money by encouraging immigrants to seek preventive care rather than waiting for more expensive emergency treatment.</p>
<p>The Southern California operation promises to assess &#8220;consulate clients&#8221; for eligibility to government-funded health insurance and other primary care services and offers free legal assistance to those who are denied coverage. Its goal is to improve access to health services for immigrants of Mexican origin by formalizing a health education, medical home referral and insurance enrollment program.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is what broke California, regardless of Schwartzenegger&rsquo;s &#8220;he doth protest too much&#8221; denial.  In 1989, the California voters passed a law that would have denied free health care and education to illegals.  The Hispanic lobby, i.e., La Raza, etc., filed lawsuits and got that law overturned as unconstitutional.  The result has been a continued flight of middle class Whites from California and the dire financial situation that afflicts California today.  I recall how La Raza promised - very publicly - in the late &rsquo;70s that they would take over California - make it a part of Mexico.  While annexation is unlikely, they certainly have made California nearly as destitute as Mexico, and nearly as crime-ridden.</p>

		<p>Wow!  Great idea, Comrade Obama.  Let&rsquo;s give taxpayer-funded programs to people who one, have no business being in this country in the first place, two, refuse to follow our laws, and, three, refuse to speak our language.  </p>

		<p>The health insurance companies hate this bill. I would agree with them. Some of you disagree. But contact the Washington coalition of health insurance companies. This is an excellent way for the private sector to kill this awful bill. It&rsquo;s awful because of the alien benefits, and for other reasons upon which many of you may disagree with me. But even if you like national health insurance, you don&rsquo;t want the aliens part of it. They will bankrupt the system, which will be under great stress anyway since Obama wants to insure everybody.</p>

		<p>I keep hearing about the destruction of California due to the massive flow of cultural enrichment into the state.  Is it really that bad?  What percentage of whites have left in the last 10 to 20 years?  Can anyone recommend a blog site where I can read about this? (for example, South Africa has the blog spot www.zasucks.com)  Hey Jared, could you please write a book about this?  Because this is a nation of cowards, and I can&rsquo;t think of anybody else who is up to the task.</p>

		<p>This health care bill is about the biggest con I&rsquo;ve ever witnessed in my lifetime, with cap and trade almost as bad.</p>
<p>More than anything else, the attempts to get so-called universal healthcare has revealed who the worst demagogues in Congress are.  They&rsquo;re shameless.</p>
<p>It will pass, but it looks like it won&rsquo;t take effect until 2013.  If that&rsquo;s the case, there won&rsquo;t be enough money in the treasury to pay for an aspirin, let alone a trillion or so for universal coverage.</p>
<p>2013 is about the time the balloon goes up, after three years of sparing in preparation for the final skirmish.  I&rsquo;m looking for the country to be in the throes of break up about that time.</p>
<p>All  Obama&rsquo;s efforts to create a pro-black, fascist country will be for naught.</p>

		<p>THis is why &#8220;health care reform&#8221; is really just a naked power grab by the Federal government.</p>
<p>THe penalty for illegal immigration is deportation. Federal officials are obligated to deport illegals. Now, we know that the 20-30 million illegals here are a huge factor in the so called &#8220;health care crisis&#8221;. They are causing a large part of it. Now, if Federal government officials really wanted to help the quality and cost of health care in our country, they would do their sworn jobs and deport the illegals. But, in fact, they are doing just the opposite. Not only illegally keeping them here, but also making them entitled to taxpayer provided benefits.</p>

<p>After all they will soon be given amnesty.</p>

		<p>Uninsured working white people will forego the healthcare they need because they don&rsquo;t have the funds to pay, while the illegals and welfare parasites get every last thing they need on the money they take in taxes from the same people who go without.<br>
Maybe if I didn&rsquo;t have to pay a hefty state income tax on top of the already dreadful federal income tax, and then tax on everything else except the air I breathe,.. maybe I could afford health insurance too.  Don&rsquo;t ever move to the state of North Carolina, the governor is a total idiot.</p>

<p>I would also add printing massive amounts of money, baked by nothing, in the name of a &#8216;stimulus.&rsquo;  There will be a hefty price to pay when the real shake-out starts.</p>
<p>Economist Arthur Laffer reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A huge inflationary crises is on the way.  The unprecedented expansion of the money supply is outside the realm of our prior experiential base, we haven&rsquo;t ever seen anything like this in the US.  To find a similar increase in money supply during this century, you need to look to Zimbabwe&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>Claims that free health care for illegal immigrants is in the healthcare bill are bogus;</p>
<p>House Bill: &#8220;No Federal Payment for Undocumented Aliens.&#8221; According to America&rsquo;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, Page 143, Line 3, Section 246: &#8220;No Federal Payment for Undocumented Aliens.

		<p>While I posted against the coverage of illegals and other marginal citizens, I recognize as one who practiced in health care delivery for 25 years that we will never have a good system as long as it is run by private insurers whose main concern is satisfying their investor&rsquo;s desire for profits and the company stock market ratings.  The basic truth is that profiting from sickness and disease is unethical and immoral.  If we had a 100% white population, I would be even more for a socialized healthcare system.  Medicare has an overhead of 3% while private insurance companies (that pay for health care) have 35%.  The industry (industry, ha, what do they produce?) - is spending millions to make sure that social conservatives like us continue to believe that they are the rights ones to deliver care by pushing that old &#8220;commie, socialist&#8221; button so many inadvertantly have impressed on their brains.  This is a ridiculous debate as it is so blantantly clear that greed is behind the &#8220;social medicine&#8221; scare.  Your care is doled out to you now by careless, greed motivated private, for profit regulators.  I guess most Amren posters are wealthy and have plenty of money for expensive insurance policies and cash reserves besides?  Some of you need to get out of the U.S. and find out how the rest of the white world is getting along instead of relying on your lying, bought, conservative politicians.  While I am not with Obama or the Dems on social and most legislative issues, healthcare is a different story.  Walking lockstep based on imprinted and erroneous impressions is not evidence of high intelligence, but gut level, reptilian nervous responses.</p>

		<p>Take a look at YouTube&hellip; &#8220;Arab Festival 2009: Sharia in the US&#8221;<br>
You tell me, do you think Mexicans, well dressed and presumably not criminal, would behave like these &#8220;Arab Americans&#8221; behave?<br>
Honestly, don&rsquo;t you feel a little threatened by these Muslim types? Would you rather have Mexican Christians in your neighborhood or some of these Muslim creeps? The American white population can reach out to the Mexican nation, and progress can be made, but I don&rsquo;t think anything will ever come of Arab Muslims in this country but trouble. They really, really want to remain separate and to gain power here. They really have contempt for our country, Americans. <br>
We are unused to dealing with such a threat as these thugs represent. I can handle &#8220;habla Espanol&#8221; used car lots and Spanish spoken in McDonalds kitchens for years and years but the kind of hostility to our people that Muslim extremists represent is totally intolerable.</p>

		<p>Anonymous troll that posted URLs from a certain George Soros astroturfing organization:</p>
<p>That is merely the language in one of several health care reform proposals, meant to placate the masses.  There is no way the Democrats will pass a health care bill with that language in it.</p>
<p>But even if that language does become part of the reforms that are passed and the President signs, it is irrelevant, for three reasons:</p>
<p>(1)  There is no enforcement mechanism.  It would be like posting speed limits and then not allowing cops to write speeding tickets.</p>
<p>(2)  Even if there is an enforcement mechanism, there are always fake citizenship documents.  And since the news of illegal aliens being busted for phony SSNs, etc. is a frequent occurrence, why wouldn&rsquo;t they get fake docs to get health care?</p>
<p>(3)  Beyond that, if the illegals have no fake documents, do you honestly think that the Federal bureaucrats, mainly black, Hispanic, white liberal, or other assorted liberal and pandering type, will turn away illegal alien applicants from health care even if the law reads that they should?  Don&rsquo;t forget, the law is interpreted by judges, and by the time President Obama is done, the Federal judiciary will be full of Sonia Sotomayors, who will eventually rule that the (useless) ban on illegal aliens is unconstitutional.  And Obama&rsquo;s Just-Us Department is run by Eric Holder, who won&rsquo;t lift a finger to enforce such a law that your George Soros URLs brag about.</p>
<p>I have two words for you:  Get, and real.  </p>
<p>Mark:  It was found out that some Hispanics were helping the 9/11 terrorists.  As it is, they can easily pass for Hispanic in Mexico and sneak across the U.S. Border.  That was told to us by none other than Geraldo Rivera, in a short-lived Bill O&rsquo;Reilly hosted weekly news mag on the Fox broadcast network (not Fox News Channel) called &#8220;The Pulse,&#8221; not long after 9/11.</p>

		<p>Look, I support the idea of a sovereign America. I don&rsquo;t like illegal immigration at all. I take Michael Scheuer seriously; we have to control our borders, we have to have energy independence. However, I do think in these dangerous times we should prioritize. The Mexican America War was fought in the 1840&rsquo;s. The last incursion by Pancho Villa occurred in 1916. The war against Islamic extremists is going on now, and it looks like we may even lose. We might be facing a catastrophic nuclear attack inside our borders. Scheuer absolutely thinks it will happen.<br>
What I found particularly disturbing about the Youtube piece ( and I urge people to see it) is this: Mexican-American relations are contentious because the Mexican government is abandoning its peasantry to us. Since these people are peasants, we don&rsquo;t have to do anything for them but the minimum. Sounds inhumane but even minimal education and health care is much better than what they receive in Mexico. We can and should do this as part of a realpolitik move to counter troubles with that country.<br>
The Arab insurrection viewed here, while smaller than many immigration rallies, shows something we haven&rsquo;t seen in this country in a long long time, and that is total cultural antipathy. This is what we see in wartime. If you were a Jew and you parachuted into a Nazi rally, you would be treated in the same manner as those Christian preachers were, and that is with complete hatred. I have said before the Mexicans have a  territorial complaint; the Blacks and the Muslims have an ideological antipathy. It is much harder to tolerate the latter. There is no boundary involved, no historical dimension, just a floating miasma of hatred toward us. We have  no commonality with Arabs who want Sharia; at least we can converse with many Mexicans and other Latins using the language of religion.<br>
A thought experiment: if you were a Marine in a foxhole in Afghanistan, would you trust a fellow soldier named Diaz who had a cross hanging on his chest or a soldier, lets say a black,<br>
named Muhammed?<br>
When was the last time you heard of a Mexican Christian sniping at Americans in the manner of John Muhammed and his 17 year old sidekick?<br>
We can leave the Muslim lands, and I urge our country to do so, but we cannot leave Mexico. We have to deal with them somehow, even if it means building a wall and creating a second class citizenship for them. We have to control their criminal subculture.<br>
 It is obvious these Muslims are acting out a grievance against our culture that is extremely sharp and aggressive, and which has no corrolary in the Mexican segment of our population, that I have experienced anyway. I recall receiving a glare of pure hatred from an Iranian Muslim schoolgirl when I inquired if she felt she was an American. She said &#8220;No, I am a Muslim.&#8221; This in a school where you will see Mexican girls named America, or wearing tee shirts saying &#8220;Born in the Beautiful USA&#8221;.<br>
Think about it.</p>

		<p>Coverage in the impending Obama health care bill of illegal aliens means that the American taxpayer will be made finacially responsible for paying the health care bills of any and all human beings who are able to, now and in the future, illegally wander over our deliberately unprotected borders.</p>
<p>Passage of any bill with this provision in it is grounds for impeachment of every Member of Congress who voted for it.</p>
