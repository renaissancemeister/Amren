<h1>Microsoft Apologizes for Changing Race in Photo</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, August 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A photo on the Seattle-based company&rsquo;s [Microsoft] U.S. Web site shows two men, one Asian and one black, and a white woman seated at a conference room table. But on the Web site of Microsoft&rsquo;s Polish business unit, the black man&rsquo;s head has been replaced with that of a white man. The color of his hand remains unchanged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking into the details of this situation,&#8221; Microsoft spokesperson Lou Gellos said in a statement Tuesday. &#8220;We apologize and are in the process of pulling down the image.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The only thing bad about this is the photoshopped head is about 2/3 the size of what it should be.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t part of the rationalization for diversity is that customers want to see people who look like them? Guess what? Poles aren&rsquo;t black. So big deal.</p>
<p>Fire the guy who did this for his technical incompetence - not for offending blacks who have know business telling companies how to market themselves in white countries.</p>
<p>Besides, you don&rsquo;t hear whites complaining about Microsoft overrepresenting minorities in photographs such as these.</p>

		<p>Odd. Usually big business tries to do exactly the opposite  &mdash;  to show diversity in its advertisements where none exists rather than to try to conceal it. I wonder if the black man was deemed to be too old looking? In which case, it&rsquo;s actually a case of &#8220;ageism&#8221; rather than &#8220;racism,&#8221; so that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

		<p>The White man&rsquo;s head doesn&rsquo;t belong on the Black man&rsquo;s body, but the Black man doesn&rsquo;t really belong in the picture at all.  Will Microsoft apologize to Americans for the dishonest premise of the original photo?</p>

		<p>The only thing that Microsoft did wrong was to take the lazy way out by doctoring the photo, rather than reshooting the image with a different model. </p>
<p>And even the doctoring doesn&rsquo;t bother me particularly for one reason: THESE ARE NOT REAL PEOPLE. Sure, the models were real, but the piece is using them as generic characters to represent a larger whole, in this case a customer base.</p>
<p>Pegging models to create an image of diversity happens all the time. The only difference is that it&rsquo;s usually the minority that is overrepresented. </p>

		<p>I think the &#8220;original&#8221; is also altered, because the black guy&rsquo;s head is too big for the suit.</p>
<p>Usually, these alterations are done to insert blacks in to create a sense of diversity.  There was the Toronto travel mag here on AR a few months ago, and several years ago, a black man was inserted into a University of Wisconsin booklet.</p>

		<p>Why does Microsoft have to &#8220;apologize&#8221;???? They can market their products however they choose. </p>
<p>Have we come to such a level of insanity that we now have to &#8220;apologize&#8221; for putting white people in advertisements? This is so insane!!! </p>

		<p>	It appears (Microsoft) is proactively addressing discrimination lawsuits before they happen: successful businesses are often targeted by the NAACP and other organizations who seek to shake down big corporations with frivolous lawsuits, unfortunately this is the price of doing business in the United States, and one of the main reasons we are faltering as a nation.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal? Adds in predominately Black areas have more Blacks, like wise with Latinos. That what all marketing people do. So they put a Polish looking guy in a Polish add who cares? Companies just want their adds to blend into the local culture so the message of &ldquo;buy my product&rdquo; is viewer friendly. Microsoft owes no one apologies for being targeted by race baiters.</p>

		<p>Damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Had the photo been of one Asian and two whites and distributed here in the US, blacks would have complained that they aren&rsquo;t appealing to the black demographic. </p>
<p>Well, there aren&rsquo;t exactly many blacks in Poland, so Microsoft was appealing to THAT demographic: white people. </p>

		<p>Advertising is aimed at your desired audience.  Why would an Asian be in a Polish web site picture?  Or a black?  Why didn&rsquo;t they photograph some Polish people?  This is a non issue.  Make up is advertised for women - I don&rsquo;t care that they don&rsquo;t show men.  The Gap is for young people, should I be angry they don&rsquo;t show us middle aged folks?  I should be offended that Microsoft  doesn&rsquo;t show white men.  But then they do actively discriminate against white men in employment practices.  And Bill and Mil Gates do have a scholarship fund that mentions every ethnic group BUT whites,  Bill Gates is rotten and anti-America.</p>

		<p>If you travel to most websites these days you&rsquo;ll see a multicultural rainbow, usually with Whites - and especially White men either absent from the photo altogether or in the background someplace.  White women are usually positioned near a Tall Black man.  It&rsquo;s everywhere and the controlled media, the Z media, is stepping up the pace of multiculturalism.  </p>
<p>I was watching a Shania Twain video on youtube recently and there must have been thousands of people in the audience yet the camera kept moving to one particular Black guy near 2 White women.  FOUR times the camera showed this one particular Black with White women when there was literally thousands of other people that could have been shown.  When you see enough of these things you begin to understand what the media is doing.  During the song the camera also displayed 2 White males who appeared to be together and gave the impression of not being very manly.  The subliminal message is </p>
<p>White girls - Go and date Blacks<br>
White men - no masculinity</p>
<p>As a matter of fact here&rsquo;s the link to the video:</p>

<p>Good grief! That is pathetic and hilarious at the same time. Not only do they try to imply the two females on his left are with him they pan the camera for a different shot to make it look like the one female on his right is also with him!! The BBC is trying to create the impression that this black goofball is there with three attractive white women. Simply pathetic. The kicker is you can tell by their lack of interaction, expressions and body distance they are NOT there together. </p>
<p>Since this is Shania Twain, I would not doubt at all that this black guy is the ONLY black in the audience and he was brought up front by producers specifically to be put on camera. OR, even more likely, he is an employee of the BBC crew putting on the show and was given a black headband and told to get in front of the camera between the white girls and pretend he was enjoying the show.</p>
<p>This scenario sounds absurd but NOTHING can be put past the media when they are contriving diversity. My wife&rsquo;s friend was in media and I know for a fact they will rearrange audience members to get blacks on camera.</p>

		<p>It don&rsquo;t get no sillier than this&hellip; MS pandering to the minoritie. I mean, we all believe implicitly, Blacks are simply genius level people in general. That have to mentor and guide us Whites. Never mind that if there were any TRUTH to the racial equality myth, all races would have progressed at roughly the same rate. But as history shows us, the Industrial Revolution DID NOT start in the Congo or in Asia. It started in 19th Century WHITE EUROPE (England).</p>

		<p>A few years ago, about 1995, Ford (I think) got into a similar row.  An advert aimed at the British market featured mainly White people with a couple of non-Whites as well.  The same photo was altered for the Polish market, so that all the people featured were White.  Are people so thin-skinned nowadays that something as trivial as this upsets them?  </p>

<p>You are so right about &#8216;Nam protests.  I used to believe the sucker bait that anti-war street theater was huge, until an amateur historian I know who lived during that time told me the truth   &mdash;   the large protests were only media illusions, and the (relatively) few that did protest were egged on by Marxist college professors who wanted an American defeat in &#8216;Nam to give the Soviet Union moral energy.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a photograph of Trotsky standing at the side of Lenin giving a speech. A later updated version of the picture shows Trotsky totally erased. That was, of course, after Stalin made him a non-person. </p>
<p>Now, with so much of what we do videoed, or at least the assumption that we may have been videoed(hidden cameras?), the feeling has begun to hang over us that we better count on being videoed.</p>
<p>What we see is Rodney King being beaten by the Cops, not the actions that provoked him. How can we experience it as real if we don&rsquo;t see it over and over again on television. The choice of reality can be selective and manipulated.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
And it&rsquo;s a step from that to have the feeling that if there&rsquo;s no tape or photo(doctored or not), for all practical purposes, it didn&rsquo;t happen. Appearance become reality. Isn&rsquo;t everything important caught on camera?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the elite have pulled the racial coup in the modern World in the last hundred years, by exploiting the power of technology to confuse appearance and reality. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just marketing people. You know like when Microsoft was accused of passing on siding with humans in China in favor of the PRC allowing the PRC access to all of their operating systems sold in China via a back door and Microsoft&rsquo;s continuing efforts to help Chinese censors remove &#8220;freedom&#8221; and &#8220;democracy&#8221; from the net in China with a software package that prevents bloggers from using these and other politically sensitive words on their websites. </p>

		<p>To Patrick 2:</p>
<p>Did you happen to see the &#8220;report&#8221; put out by MSNBC with Contessa Brewer about the people with firearms being openly carried when Obama was in Arizona? Brewer cautioned how white &#8220;racists&#8221; were carrying &#8220;assault weapons&#8221; and so constituted a threat to Obama. Their cameras showed an AR-15 rifle being carried around the shoulder of one individual. All the while, Brewer is whabbling on and on about white &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Turns out, the AR-15 was being carried by a Bantu, who said he was there to exercise his Second Amendment rights. But MSNBC wanted you to think whitey was carrying that gun. MSNBC did this, by showing a close-up of the gun, but never the person, so one would think it was a Caucasian carrying that gun.</p>
<p>Gunowners really called MSNBC onto the carpet for that one. <br>
