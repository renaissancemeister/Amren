<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8199951.stm">Facial Expressions &#8216;Not Global&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Judith Burns, BBC News, August 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new study suggests that people from different cultures read facial expressions differently.</p>
<p>East Asian participants in the study focused mostly on the eyes, but those from the West scanned the whole face.</p>
<p>In the research carried out by a team from Glasgow University, East Asian observers found it more difficult to distinguish some facial expressions.</p>
<p>The work published in Current Biology journal challenges the idea facial expressions are universally understood.</p>
<p>In the study, East Asians were more likely than Westerners to read the expression for &#8220;fear&#8221; as &#8220;surprise&#8221;, and &#8220;disgust&#8221; as &#8220;anger&#8221;.</p>
<p>The researchers say the confusion arises because people from different cultural groups observe different parts of the face when interpreting expression.</p>
<p>East Asians participants tended to focus on the eyes of the other person, while Western subjects took in the whole face, including the eyes and the mouth.</p>
<p>Co-author, Dr Rachael Jack, from the University of Glasgow, said: &#8220;Interestingly, although the eye region is ambiguous, subjects tended to bias their judgements towards less socially-threatening emotions  &mdash;  surprise rather than fear, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;This perhaps highlights cultural differences when it comes to the social acceptability of emotions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team showed 13 Western Caucasians and 13 East Asians a set of standardised images depicting the seven main facial expressions: happy, sad, neutral, angry, disgusted, fearful and surprised.</p>
<p>They used eye movement trackers to monitor where the participants were looking when interpreting the expressions.</p>
<p>A computer programme given the same information from the eyes as the East Asian observers was similarly unable to distinguish between the emotions of disgust and anger, and fear and surprise.</p>
<p>The paper states that the Eastern participants used a culturally specific decoding strategy that was inadequate to reliably distinguish the universal facial expressions of fear and disgust.</p>
<p>It concluded that information from the eyes is often ambiguous and confusing in these expressions, with consequences for cross-cultural communication and globalisation.</p>
<p>The researchers also point out that this difference in perception is reflected in the differences between Eastern and Western emoticons  &mdash;  the typographical characters used to convey emotions in e-mails.</p>
<p>The Eastern emoticons are not only the right way up but focus on the eyes, whilst in the West the mouth is important.<div class="text-center"><table cellpadding="10">  <tr>    <th align="center" valign="bottom">East West Differences<br>in Emoticons Emotion</th>    <th align="center" valign="bottom">West</th>    <th align="center" valign="bottom">East</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="left">&#8216;Happy&rsquo;</td>    <td align="center">:-)</td>    <td align="center">(^_^)</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <tr>    <td align="left">&#8216;Sad&rsquo;</td>    <td align="center">:-(</td>    <td align="center">(;_;) or (T_T)</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="left">&#8216;Surprise&rsquo;</td>    <td align="center">:-o</td>    <td align="center">(o.o)</td>  </tr></table></div><br>

<p>Definitely. What I recall about the Chinese from my time spent in China, carefully controlling your emotions is considered polite. Although it is probably changing in many places now, Chinese generally don&rsquo;t smile for photographs. There were cultural differences, too. When a Chinese referred to himself, he pointed at his nose, while Americans point to their heart. Sticking the tongue out is not offensive like it is in the United States. It&rsquo;s hard to explain, but it&rsquo;s playful or sly. </p>
<p>I found that Chinese would misinterpret my verbal cues as arguing. Americans like a good discussion, but the Chinese would often think I was arguing with my friend when I was just having a good discussion.   </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a reason some ethnic groups are called &#8220;inscrutable.&#8221; The human face is the most subtle  &mdash;  and most sophisticated  &mdash;  means of conveying emotion ever devised. Consider the art created by the many cultures around the world  &mdash;  where has that subtilty, that sophistication, been depicted with more accuracy, with more artistry? Look for the media to spin this in some anti-Western direction, if they pay attention to it at all.  </p>

		<p>I have long had a theory as to why Asians developed slit eyes. I don&rsquo;t think it has anything to do with protection from the wind or sun (there are sunnier and windier places than China and no one else has such eyes). I believe the reason is social. East Asia has long been a fuel society where commoners could instantly lose their head if they looked at a superior the &#8220;wrong&#8221; way. Hence, evolution favored those who&rsquo;s eyes were hidden.</p>

<p>I found this article to be one of the more interesting ones, that AR has put up in the last few weeks. Which means of course, that it provokes several questions:</p>
<p>1.) Why is a publication titled &ldquo;Current Biology,&rdquo; only looking at &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; differences between these two racial groups and not the influences of biology within the same context;</p>
<p>2.) In relation to my first question, how does the racial influences upon cultural differences found in this study, reflect upon even more broad differences between European based and Asian based societies/peoples;</p>
<p>3.) And finally, how do these biological/cultural interactions influence facial mobility/fluidity and emotional recognition between Caucasians and Asians?</p>
<p>In short, a lot of interesting topics that will never be tackled by this so-called  &ldquo;journal&rdquo; that is misnamed &ldquo;Current Biology,&rdquo; and should be titled &ldquo;Fashionable Multicultural Dogma.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with two Chinese dentists, and I can say that they were definitely not &#8220;people persons&#8221;. Absolutely no good in the &#8220;bedside manner&#8221; department. They acted almost autistic in the way they related to patients. No jovial give-and-take. No sympathy, either. They couldn&rsquo;t care less if they hurt you. Every dental assistant I&rsquo;ve known hated working with Chinese (and Korean) dentists. Maybe their behavior has something to do with not being able to &#8220;read&#8221; their American patients. Now, these were foreign-born dentists I&rsquo;m talking about. They don&rsquo;t display emotions at all, until they go insane and cut your head off. They value being stoic above all else. Maybe that&rsquo;s why they have to look into someone&rsquo;s eyes to gauge emotion, because they&rsquo;ll never give a clue from their mouths or hands or posture. This wasn&rsquo;t necessarily true of American-born Chinese dentists, who were a lot more personable. But as I&rsquo;ve always said, if we ever have a war with the Orient again, don&rsquo;t let yourself be taken prisoner. You&rsquo;ll never get any kindness from them. </p>

		<p>I wonder if there is a connection here regarding circus clowns with highly exaggerated facial expressions painted on humans and acting in humorous parody only being found in western nations? Many of the deity god figures in India and Indonesia have really fearsome features and the Chinese &#8216;opera&rsquo; shows which can last many hours likewise express comedy in dress and stance whereas the &#8216;baddies&rsquo; have awesome painted facial characteristics. There aren&rsquo;t any women in these shows with female parts being played by boys, exactly as in Shakespearean theatre in England. Amazing that this custom has prevailed in the East but would be considered most offensive these days in the West. Food for thought perhaps, and there is a good old Yorkshire saying &#8216;There&rsquo;s nowt so queer as folk&rsquo;</p>

		<p>This whole piece is a crock.   I&rsquo;ve lived among East Asians for a time and had no trouble whatever discerning their emotional state or intentions.  Nor they mine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly true that they are generally more reticent about communicating strong emotional reactions, and that strong and direct eye contact is considered rude in many cases.  And it&rsquo;s certainly true their cultures often have different and sometimes highly ritualistic approaches to reaching agreement, especially in business transactions, but once understood and appreciated<br>
these approaches are no obstacle to forging lasting and satisfactory arrangements.</p>

<p>Jeez, what an IDIOT! So the riots started as a result of people of one race not looking at people of another race in the eye? A stretch if there ever was one.</p>

<p>Funnily if you do point out any &#8216;cultural differences&rsquo;, no matter how even handed.<br>
If any offense is taken by said group or our own traitorous (we&rsquo;ll buy your gratitude) liberals. <br>
I promise you that they won&rsquo;t be accusing you of being a &#8216;culturist&rsquo; or of engaging in &#8216;culturism.&rsquo;<br>
We&rsquo;d get the dreaded &#8216;R&rsquo; word with all the biological ramifications attached, though &#8220;race is a social&hellip;.blah,blah.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
So when we act as &#8220;culturists&#8221; we are called &#8220;racists,&#8221; and then when we say that differences are clearly biological we&rsquo;re told that &#8220;no, all differences are cultural only&#8221; (oh and by the way you&rsquo;re a racist.) <br>
It&rsquo;s a circular argument, where the rules keep contradicting<br>
but the accusation is that you&rsquo;re always focused on the biological.<br>
Possibly I&rsquo;m just picking on the semantics of the &#8216;racism&rsquo; word but the nature/nurture, biological/cultural extremes are getting too confused by the average person.<br>
To the point where most people I know are either scared silent or they start talking then stop themselves because they hear how &#8216;classically racist&rsquo; they sound (then go back to silence.)</p>
<p>There are so many fallacies and double standards in the racial argument that really need to be updated.<br>
Because WW2 is over and slavery is long gone, the civil rights movement was in the sixties and we have new problems today such as.<br>
-With all this talk of the importance of preserving &#8216;culture&rsquo; we&rsquo;re not doing much to preserve our own.<br>
-We say we don&rsquo;t exist as a group while protecting the rights of other groups (who apparently do exist.)<br>
-We&rsquo;ll happily change or give up our traditions while accommodating those who can&rsquo;t even be bothered to learn our language or who think we&rsquo;re Satanic infidels.<br>
-Discriminating against one group to raise another is wrong <br>
-Saying that we are all equal does nothing but create false expectations and frustration in those who are not meeting the standards while &#8216;our betters&rsquo; are plowing on ahead.<br>
-Global population growth rates are everyone&rsquo;s problem and we can&rsquo;t go from one to six billion people in 100 years without some problems, especially when White peoples birth rates can&rsquo;t seem to go above 1.8 babies per woman.<br>
Yet recently we hear that Western birth rates are going up because richer educated woman are deciding to have more babies (yeah right.) http://tinyurl.com/pfa3b3<br>
-Right wingers are evil and stupid and left wingers are the enlightened intelligent ones (just because.)<br>
Maybe this was true from a sixties POV of view but I feel the Right wing has become the &#8216;new protectors&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before more and more people &#8216;wake up&rsquo; and see where we&rsquo;re at and where we are heading.</p>
<p>&hellip;. of course there&rsquo;s lots more.<br>
I can&rsquo;t help but think that the things that made us great such as our ideas on equality and our academic and technological developments are also our undoing.<br>
I think as a people we not need only more cohesion and but some more hunger too (the latter being about the only benefit I can see that &#8216;diversity&rsquo; brings.)</p>

		<p>GOaway, has it correctly, there is more to it than just the expression, subtle or not. MY most frightening experience ever was with a Chinese doctor in Chicago. His hatred of Causcasians or perhaps all people not Oriental was clear in his slap, kick force and punch exam, including a very painful prostate exam. Guy damn near finished me off. The physical by the way was required by uncle Sam to allow me, a Brit . to get a green card back in the seventies. Non Western societies do not understand empathy nor sympathy.</p>

		<p>The statement that Western emoticons focus entirely on the mouth is not quite correct  &mdash;  it is also common to use 8-) for a pleasant surprise, 8-( for a not-pleasant surprise, and 8-O for a state of total shock.</p>
<p>The general rule is that any emoticon can represent surprise simply by replacing the &#8216;:&rsquo; that stands for the eyes with &#8216;8&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Also, ^_^ can also be a tiny picture of a cat.</p>

		<p>My wife has worked for many years training social workers on a master&rsquo;s degree level. Her University has a cooperative degree program with a Chinese College in Hong Kong, so she has trained many Chinese students as well as American students. </p>
<p>She has encountered some startling cultural differences that she discusses in her classes. For example she always asks her students about a hypothetical situation where the student is in a terrible disaster and has the split second decision of saving the life of their own child or the life of their elderly parent or grandparent. There are no other options, only one life can be saved and the other will be lost. 100% of the Chinese students would save the elderly person, while 100% of the Western students would save the baby.</p>
<p>When these students are asked why, the Western students reply that the elderly person had already lived most of their life and would want to save the baby anyway. The Chinese students reply that in their society, the elderly are due great respect because of their life experience and wisdom and besides you could always have or adopt another baby.</p>

<p>Notice that the Eastern emoticon expressing &#8220;happy&#8221; shows an expressionless mouth. That Asians do not see it necessary to draw a smiling mouth suggests that they do feel the mouth a necessary component in expressing happiness. In fact, the mouth is expressionless in &#8220;sad&#8221; and non-existent in &#8220;surprise.&#8221; In each of the 3 emoticons, the eyes are the central feature. </p>

		<p>Now, when did 13 become a statistically-valid sample?  And doesn&rsquo;t this East-Asians-can&rsquo;t-read-emotions guff conflict with the rather widely-held and AmRen-endorsed view that East Asians are more community- and consensus-valuing than Westerners?  So a few people here have had a bad experience with a Chinese doctor or dentist.  Could it be that medicine and dentistry attract nerdy, intellect-over-emotion types?  That&rsquo;s the stereotype here in the UK, and it&rsquo;s certainly borne out by my personal experience.  Only recently have doctors been trained to show empathy.  They&rsquo;ll soon catch up in the East, and a short time later they will also have social workers in police uniforms.</p>
