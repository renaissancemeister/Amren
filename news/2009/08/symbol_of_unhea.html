<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/world/africa/05congo.html">Symbol of Unhealed Congo: Male Rape Victims</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey Gettleman, New York Times, Aug. 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For years, the thickly forested hills and clear, deep lakes of eastern Congo have been a reservoir of atrocities. Now, it seems, there is another growing problem: men raping men.</p>
<p>According to Oxfam, Human Rights Watch, United Nations officials and several Congolese aid organizations, the number of men who have been raped has risen sharply in recent months, a consequence of joint Congo-Rwanda military operations against rebels that have uncapped an appalling level of violence against civilians. </p>
<p>Aid workers struggle to explain the sudden spike in male rape cases. The best answer, they say, is that the sexual violence against men is yet another way for armed groups to humiliate and demoralize Congolese communities into submission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[N]obody knows the exact number. Men here, like anywhere, are reluctant to come forward. Several who did said they instantly became castaways in their villages, lonely, ridiculed figures, derisively referred to as &#8220;bush wives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, here again is a sign of greater intelligence, a wonderful, sacred mantra of cultural diversity that we are compelled to bow a knee. Like Muslim girls, women who are raped, &#8220;the victim is the culprit and must pay the price too&#8221;.</p>

		<p>More news from Africa via the BBC Maybe Chelsea and Godwin Kipkemoi Chepkurgor will produce another Obama.</p>
<p> <br>
Kenyan renews Chelsea goat offer  <br>
 <br>
The offer of 40 goats and 20 cows is generous in Kenyan terms <br>
A Kenyan man has told the BBC how happy he is that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has agreed to renew his marriage offer to her daughter.</p>
<p>In 2000, Godwin Kipkemoi Chepkurgor wrote to her husband Bill Clinton, the then-US president, offering 40 goats and 20 cows for Chelsea Clinton&rsquo;s hand. </p>
<p>In Kenya on the first leg of her African tour, Mrs Clinton was informed by a journalist of the proposal. </p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter is her own person. I will convey this very kind offer,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>If Ms Clinton, 29, accepted she would become Mr Chepkurgor&rsquo;s second wife, as he has married since his initial proposal. <br>
 <br>
If Ms Clinton accepted the offer, she would be Mr Chepkurgor&rsquo;s second wife <br>
Mr Chepkurgor, 40, a councillor in Nakuru in Kenya&rsquo;s Rift Valley, said his first wife knew about the renewal of his affections and &#8220;did not object&#8221;. </p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Muliro Telewa in Nakuru says the offer of 40 goats and 20 cows for the bride price is very generous in Kenyan terms. </p>
<p>&#8220;I feel very good for her [Mrs Clinton] to have answered - almost in the affirmative,&#8221; Mr Chepkurgor told the BBC&rsquo;s Network Africa programme. </p>
<p>&#8220;She promised that she will take the proposal to the daughter and I am now waiting,&#8221; he said. <br>

		<p>I wonder if this diverse cultural tradition has anything to do with the unrivaled HIV rates among Africans (wherever they are found). Many studies have shown a higher prevalence of homosexual activity among Black men even if they identify themselves as heterosexuals. Widespread bisexuality, polygamy, rape on the mega-scale, how can anyone be surprised at the state of the African people?</p>

		<p>Just another typical black run country. Haiti, Jamaica, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Detroit&hellip;.. its always the same picture with blacks. And always will be. Ironically the Congo region is one of the richest areas in the world for natural resources. If the land was populated by intelligent and industrious people like Japanese or Chinese or any of a number of European ethnicities it would probably be an economic powerhouse.</p>

		<p>The newspapers always use incorrect terminology very often.</p>
<p>These men weren&rsquo;t raped, they were &#8220;sodomized.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the radical feminists who insisted on renaming the pervision in order to hopefully make people feel as if there is no difference between rape and sodomy. </p>
<p>Like every other radical leftist terminology, it is used to promote a false idea in the mind of the public. </p>
<p>Too, aren&rsquo;t these incidents similar to the ones described by AR in an article about black on white male &#8220;rape&#8221; in prison?</p>

<p>&#8216;Al Qaeda Accused of Using Male Rape to Recruit Suicide Bombers<br>

<p>And to &#8220;ice at 9:45 AM&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny you should mention the presses liberal slant on reporting, a couple of days ago I saw a very sympathetic report on the illegals in Calais, France. <br>
Similar to this one. <br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6Pv3uY0RJI&amp;feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6Pv3uY0RJI&feature;=channel_page</a> </p>
<p>Where the illegals run the gauntlet of trucks going to the UK via the &#8216;chunnnel.&rsquo; <br>
To get all the goodies on offer if they make it to land of unlimited milk and honey and claim asylum.<br>
If you listen to the illegals talk, getting to the UK is akin to winning the lottery with free houses, education and health care (and of course once there, time to get the rest of the clan over.)</p>
<p>That Amren byline from a few weeks ago says it all to me &#8220;stop the goodies and illegals don&rsquo;t come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amrener&rsquo;s may remember this area from the story of the naive reporter who got gang raped while trying to conduct an interview in the tent shanty quaintly know as &#8216;the jungle.&rsquo; https://tinyurl.com/lhpt5s</p>
<p>In the report I saw the other night they just referred to this prior incident as a &#8216;serious assault.&rsquo; <br>
We wouldn&rsquo;t want to offend the violent, illegal, gang rapists now would we?<br>
As that would be rude.</p>

<p>This rationalization is VERY common among Hispanics, and Blacks, and Arabs.  Extremely so. They&rsquo;re all in denial. To them, they&rsquo;re just having a little fun on the side.  But consider them gay?  Certainly NOT!!! They just like sex, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s always the OTHER person who&rsquo;s homosexual. </p>

		<p><i>Aid workers struggle to explain the sudden spike in male rape cases. The best answer, they say, is that the sexual violence against men is yet another way for armed groups to humiliate and demoralize Congolese communities into submission.</i></p>
<p><br>
Then again, maybe it&rsquo;s just the hyperactive African libido that&rsquo;s to blame. Their notorious sexual incontinence and their childlike desire for instant gratification. </p>
<p>Let me see if I can explain this in language that&rsquo;s in compliance with AR&rsquo;s commenting guidelines&hellip; </p>
<p>When there are women around, African males will commence having sex with those women almost indiscriminately. Sure, the men prefer the more attractive females, but it&rsquo;s clear from all the overweight babymamas one sees waddling around any US ghetto that an awful lot of black men are having an awful lot of sex with an awful lot of black women who are (by any reasonable standards) <i>decidedly unattractive.</i> </p>
<p>So when black males can&rsquo;t find an appealing female, they&rsquo;ll take an unappealing one. And when they can&rsquo;t find any females at all, they&rsquo;ll take a man. As other posters have noted, it&rsquo;s exactly the same scenario that happens in prison. It&rsquo;s just their old &#8220;anything that moves&#8221; impulse in action yet again. </p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t really represent a new low for sub-Saharan Africa.  They already have a large &#8220;infant rape&#8221; problem, after all.</p>
<p>The list of bleeding-heart organizations concerned of this was interesting, however: Oxfam, Human Rights Watch and the UN.  I can&rsquo;t wait for their eventual claims that white men are somehow responsible for all this.</p>

		<p>I think I speak for the vast majority of white/Asian men when I say that, no matter how horny I might be, I would never consider having sex with another man.  The fact that male rape is so common among Africans (wherever they are found) lends credence to the claim that African men will have sex with just about anything.  And that helps explain why African women, by and large, are unattractive.  There was little evolutionary pressure for them to be attractive.</p>

		<p>How is any of this news, actually?</p>
<p>As previous posters have noted, this occurs with great frequency among Bantus in American prisons.</p>
<p>It is well-documented that African Bantus have taken to raping women, sodomizing infant boys and girls, and even having sex with farm animals, and human corpses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just Bantus being Bantus.</p>
