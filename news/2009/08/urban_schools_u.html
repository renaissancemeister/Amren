<h1>Urban Schools Use Marketing to Woo Residents Back</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Zinie Chen Sampson, AP, August 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Most students try not to think about school during the summer. But a number of them took to the streets on a sweltering August day to talk up public education to people who might normally enroll their children in private or parochial schools.</p>
<p>Clad in T-shirts promoting &#8220;The Choice,&#8221; about 100 students, parents and administrators went door-to-door on a recent Saturday, asking Richmond homeowners to give their neighborhood schools a second look. Joining them was Virginia&rsquo;s first lady Anne Holton, a product of city schools.</p>
<p>The $50,000 campaign by a school system still trying to rebound from a long history of racial segregation and white flight is an example of efforts under way in several cities to retain students. School districts are highlighting improvements to halt declining head counts so they can retain their funding, especially in light of drastic state budget cuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are still stuck with perceptions of yesteryear, and are not really aware of what we have to offer today,&#8221; Richmond Superintendent Yvonne Brandon said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not perfect, but be a part of the solution and become invested now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like other urban school districts, Richmond, where 88 percent of students are black, 7 percent are white, and 71 percent are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, has struggled on many fronts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other urban school systems have undertaken similar recruitment campaigns, including Detroit, Milwaukee and Washington, D.C., all districts that continue to lose students, which translates into less money to maintain educational programs.</p>
<p>Detroit&rsquo;s fiscally troubled system has lost more than 45 percent of its students over the last decade, leading to scores of school closures. The district this month launched a $500,000 &#8220;I&rsquo;m In&#8221; campaign to keep students in the district, enlisting the help of ex-NBA player Derrick Coleman and comedian Bill Cosby and donations from private companies  &mdash;  including pro-bono work from advertising and public-relations agencies, spokesman Steven Wasko said.</p>
<p>The school system gets about $7,560 in state funds for each enrolled student. Its enrollment target is 83,777, and &#8220;any student above that translates into more funding,&#8221; Wasko said.</p>

		<p>Oh I get it now.  If dropouts return to urban school districts, they will become geniuses, and every social problem will be solved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just cynical enough to think that the schools are marginally better (or, less bad) because they&rsquo;re not there to mess things up for everyone else.</p>

		<p>Who are theses ads aimed at?  Any white person who would send their child to an inner-city school is subjecting that child to beatings, rapes and murder.  The hate crimes against white children are horrific.</p>
<p>Any black person who has any sense and has managed to lift himself up, escaped the slums and is trying to raise decent children isn&rsquo;t go for this.  Why would you want your child to be forced into a gang, subjected to sexually transmitted diseases and otherwise sucked into hip-hop culture?</p>
<p>Waste of time and money.</p>

		<p>Public school districts like Richmond may have been wholesome in the past but now are simply daytime <i>kraals</i> for uneducable, undisciplined students of color, thanks to the atrocious Brown v. Board of Education case.  Parents who care about their children and who can afford any kind of alternative education are not going to let them go to school with these government wards, not ever.</p>

		<p>	I implore you good people to not subject your children to the not so tender mercies of a public school system that has in its ranks high percentages of black students; I know what it&rsquo;s like to attend such schools, it hampered my education.<br>
	<br>
	I was the type that would fight back and often found myself out numbered. Others who couldn&rsquo;t fight back were even worst off; white children are often the target of attacks by blacks; some whites fell prey to their rhetoric, other are singled out accosted and tormented, I did everything I could do to avoid blacks, crime was pervasive and omnipresent, there was no escape. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	I&rsquo;ve seen blacks surround young girls cornering them and if the girl rejects their advices she&rsquo;s a racist, and she becomes a target of their collective anger. Fathers and Mothers: Warn your children of the danger in associating with other races particularly Blacks.<br>

		<p>Oh yeah. A white parent is gonna put his kids in a system that is 88% black. That parent should have his kids taken away and put in foster care. Homeschool if you have to if you can&rsquo;t afford a private school. Or move. To the mountains of Virginia if you can&rsquo;t afford the suburbs of Richmond. But don&rsquo;t deny your white kids an education and put them at risk of beatings, rape or murder.</p>

		<p>In San Francisco,whites are complete wusses.They pay the highest property taxes in the state to pay for a school system that caters to minorities, especially blacks, but not whites, so they pay exorbitent rates to send their kids to private schools that are decent to whites, but when it is election time,and the school board is on the ballot, they are completely brain dead, and they vote in white liberal marxists and minority ethnochauvanists. If they had any kind of brains, they could completely reverse the direction of the sad state of the school system.</p>

<p>Uh, bull!!  It isn&rsquo;t yesteryear, it&rsquo;s yesterday, and today, and it&rsquo;s not just a perception, it&rsquo;s reality.  <br>
And all that extra funding just seems to go to waste, because so many kids are just sent to hang out until 3:00 every day.  </p>

		<p>Is it just me, or is the idea of marketing the DETROIT SCHOOL SYSTEM rather amusing? </p>
<p>I am thrilled that public schools now are finding that even at (arguably) free public schools have to deal with market forces. Fortunately there are enough parents who see them for what they are.  Between the liberalized curricula and forced integration, their value is dropping every year. Home schooled students frequently appear at the top of academic competitions. Is it a surprise anymore? </p>
<p>I work for a law enforcement agency, and I can&rsquo;t count how many &#8216;students&rsquo; I have arrested from my local public school for various offenses. Those that werent arrested were pregnant more times than I can recall. Why would I want to send my child to such a place? </p>
<p><br>
I have one son, and he is nearing the end of his HS education, all in private schools.  I remind him almost daily that he is already a very dangerous force in america, an educated, racially aware, independent thinker. </p>

		<p>7 percent white? What in the world are these parents thinking? There is NO WAY on earth I would subject my children to such misery. My kids go to a school that is 90 percent white. When there is trouble, guess who is at the center of it? You got it, it&rsquo;s always a black kid. If they will disrupt class when there are so few of them, I can&rsquo;t begin to imagine what it must be like to have a building full of them.</p>

		<p> Even if the parents send their children to a private school, they still have to pay school taxes. So they are getting the money for the school. Are they so sadistic that now they want the white parents to expose their children to the daily beatings, taunts, threats, thievery and denigration of having to endure that sort of torture?Is it truly so important to the blacks and &#8220;white elite&#8221; that all white students must be constantly provoked and then called racist if they have the unimitigated gall and audacity to actually stand up for themselves? These are not rhetorical questions for the white parent. They demand clear concise honest answers.<br>
 It&rsquo;s a well established fact that black and white administrators will stand with the black students against any white student. When the chips are down, the only thing that counts is political correctness.<br>
 The teacher, vice-principal, principal, associate superintendant, superintendant and the school board will all back the black before ever considering the plight of the white student.A white parent that freely exposes their children to the aforementioned items is an unfit parent!</p>

<p>Peejay, I&rsquo;m from San Francisco too. I don&rsquo;t think there is a choice.  Since around 1970 just about every person who runs for office is either an insane White marxist or a non White racist determined to destroy Whites. That is all there is in San Francisco public life.</p>
<p>Remember District Attorney Terrence Hallinan?  A third generation member of the CPUSA who vowed to never prosecute black common criminals but only White white collar criminals. </p>
<p> What about the civilian employees of the Sheriff&rsquo;s department (the ones who can work for the sheriff with lengthy felony convictions)?  A parolee convicted of first degree murder was &#8220;executive director&#8221; of one of the gang intervention programs.  The rest of the civilian employees of the Sheriff are the usual mix of black muslim and LARAZA criminals and White absolutely insane marxists.</p>

		<p>So let me see if I understand this&hellip;.<br>
I pay income-taxes, as well as property-taxes, to support government-run schools.<br>
The schools, in turn, repeatedly say I&rsquo;m not giving them enough money&hellip;..<br>
As they use the money I give them to buy advertising&hellip; from a private media company&hellip;?<br>
It&rsquo;s the new GOVERNMEDIA!<br>
They&rsquo;re buying ads for all sorts of government services now.  Their &#8220;partnering&#8221; with the 20th century media-companies!  Now there are ads to make sure you know how to get free; <br>
Food stamps<br>
WIC checks<br>
Welfare<br>
health care<br>
Unemployment checks  etc..<br>
All paid for you and me - you know, the 40% of adult Americans, (mainly white), that actually PAY the aforementioned taxes&hellip;<br>
GOVERNMEDIA   &mdash;    Trust them to look out for YOU!<br>

		<p>This goes beyond just &#8220;urban&#8221; public schools marketing efforts. In North Carolina there are millions of dollars worth of interstate highway billboards promoting second and third tier (mostly HBUC) constituent institutes of the University of North Carolina system. Ditto for community colleges.</p>

		<p>Not so long ago I heard a minister that laid it out thus: We can break the backs of the public education system by simply removing 24 million students nationwide. He was speaking in regard to their anti-christian behaviors, but it really is no different for their anti-white behaviors. </p>
