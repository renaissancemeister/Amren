<h1>&#8216;Little Rock 9&rsquo; Member Tells Teens Racism Is Alive</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Parsons, AP, July 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Minnijean Brown Trickey, one of the nine black students who desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957, spoke recently before a group of teenage girls and told them that they still need to guard against racism and what she described as willful ignorance today.</p>
<p>Trickey, 67, said she sees white and black students in the classrooms of the school she fought to attend, choosing to seat themselves in groups of blacks and whites and associate with students of the same race. A lack of diversity in people&rsquo;s personal lives breeds ignorance, she said, and ignorance  &mdash;  especially willful ignorance  &mdash;  breeds racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;We never got integration,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We got a measure of desegregation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said the need for diversity in people&rsquo;s lives has never been stronger, and lamented the relative lack of diversity even today in Little Rock, where blacks and whites socialize separately though they may attend classes and work together, and other minority groups are represented only in tiny numbers. She contrasted that with the advantages enjoyed by her children, raised in northern Ontario, who were able to choose a school with students from a broad range of ethnic and social backgrounds.</p>
<p>She told the youngsters that the principles of nonviolence taught by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mohandas Gandhi, who led the fight for India&rsquo;s independence from Great Britain, are as useful in everyday lives as they are in great causes.</p>

		<p>What she didn&rsquo;t tell you is that the basis of the attempt to integrate Little Rock&rsquo;s schools was totally false.  The black schools in LR pre-integration were getting more money per pupil per year than the white schools.</p>

		<p>I will add to what Question Diversity said in comment #1. I attended a school in the Memphis area that had been the colored school during segregation. After the schools were integrated the white school was shut down because it was old and dilapidated. In fact, that colored school was the first school in the area to have had air conditioning. And most of the teachers were carry-overs from segregation as well. From my experience, there wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong with the building, books or teachers. It was the out of control kids that were the problem!</p>

		<p>I attended the Little Rock public school system years ago. At one of the schools I attended, every clique except the small group of intellectuals was either all white, all black or all Asian. The phenomenon became really pronounced at lunch time and recess, so much so that the school administration (probably with some prompting from the liberal intellectuals on the student council) devised an &#8220;Interracial Day&#8221; (actually, there were several of these) where blacks and whites were forced to engage in silly games together in the gym, just so they would have to associate. Happily, that little exercise in political correctness seems not to have made any lasting impact.</p>
<p>As to the de facto segregation breeding ignorance, and ignorance breeding racism, I would maintain that having blacks and whites together in the same institution actually fostered a great deal of understanding   &mdash;   hence the subsequent segregation.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute.  If racial tension and &#8216;hate&rsquo; is going up because of an increase in diversity&hellip;then wouldn&rsquo;t it stand to reason that the time for <i>segregation</i> has &#8216;never been better&rsquo;?  What is it with liberals?  Each time their social experiments fail, it&rsquo;s always &#8216;throw more money at the problem&rsquo; or &#8216;let&rsquo;s take opposite groups of people with nothing in common and see what happens.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The 1954 Supreme Court school desegregation decision, Brown vs. Board of Education, was a case of &#8220;nationjacking&#8221; if there ever was one.</p>
<p>How the evil deed was done was the subject of a  New York Times editorial on March 24, 1987, entitled:</p>
<p>&#8220;With All Deliberate Impropriety&#8221;.</p>
<p>That editorial discussed the highly improper collaboration between Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter and Justice Dept. attorney Philip Elman, assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General at the time, to find ways to overcome the Court&rsquo;s initial opposition to the claims of Brown.</p>
<p>Their connivance is discussed in an excellent book review at:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/ovzxgw</p>
<p>(From the review, here&rsquo;s Erwin Griswold&rsquo;s reaction to Elman&rsquo;s disclosures at the time):</p>
<p>&#8220;Erwin N. Griswold, a former solicitor general and dean of Harvard Law School, was &#8216;startled&rsquo; at the impropriety, as were many others. Griswold said the behavior of Frankfurter and Elman was &#8216;clearly regarded as improper at the time and would clearly be improper now.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The following account of a reunion of the lawyers for the plaintiff reveals some of their motivation, and other interesting facts:</p>

I file these stories under <b>&#8220;Keep the Hate Alive&#8221;</b>.</p>
<p>You would think that these people who claim to have suffered the alleged horrors of segregation and Jim Crow would acknowledge SOME progress. How can people like this not see &#8216;progress&rsquo;? I see &#8216;progress&rsquo; every day in my neighborhood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s people like this that convince me that segregation and Jim Crow couldn&rsquo;t have been as bad as blacks claim. I listen to black talk radio and between the condemnation of segregation is a longing for what blacks have lost through integration. I know that in their hearts, many blacks would love to have their own communities but they don&rsquo;t want to admit that their &#8216;civil rights leaders&rsquo; of the past sold them a fantasy.<br>

<p>Interesting that people in general and fools like this woman don&rsquo;t have any idea of Gandhi&rsquo;s thoughts about blacks (kafirs as Gandhi would say).</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;d like people to know what he thought of blacks. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d find his ideas about blacks quite enlightening,</p>

		<p>It is really beyond my comprehension that these blacks keep saying that &#8220;we are not there yet&#8221; when all they have to do is look in their own communities and see that it is their own doing that their people are behind the problems that they are having. As far as integration goes what do these people want? To force Whites and others to be friends with them? </p>

		<p>Whites always lose. Every time. It&rsquo;s no surprise blacks call for &#8216;integration&rsquo; and &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. Whites lose, often-times severely, while blacks get to Play the victim all the while the abuse is occurring. It&rsquo;s a wonder integrated whites are sane. Mr Trickey obviously lives in some kind of weird, hollywood-newsmedia alternate universe where blacks are peaceful and restrained and whites are ignorant and violent. </p>
<p>What Trickey proposes here borders on reckless endangerment. In fact it&rsquo;s beyond that. Certainly stronger words are needed to accurately describe what Mr Trickey&rsquo;s advice means for whites. As long as the media or government doesn&rsquo;t recognize the real truth, Mr Trickey couldn&rsquo;t care less either. Whites are less than human for far too many like Mr Trickey. They are always less than human, unless of course you are white and it&rsquo;s you and your kids. Unless of course it&rsquo;s you. You will be quickly silenced if it is you. Whites don&rsquo;t enter his thoughts at all, outside of their role as official oppressors and nothing more. The evil one is Mr Trickey, however. </p>

Spartan24: <i>It is really beyond my comprehension that these blacks keep saying that &ldquo;we are not there yet&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>For blacks, it&rsquo;s all or nothing. When blacks say, &#8216;we&rsquo;re not there yet&rsquo; what they mean is that the black man doesn&rsquo;t have absolute, dictatorial power to claim what is rightfully his.</p>
<p>So even with a black president, a black middle class, black mayors, governess, CEO, CBC etc, blacks still don&rsquo;t control everything. Only when blacks have absolute power will blacks feel they&rsquo;ve made it. Of course, you and I know what the end result of absolute black power is; Uganda, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Haiti, Detroit, etc.</p>

<p>Exactly right. There will never be enough &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; because as soon as there is, these charlatans are out of a job. And race-mongering pays very well indeed, just ask Jackson, Sharpton and Gates.  </p>

		<p>To these race hustlers, no matter how much diversity we get, it&rsquo;s never enough. There&rsquo;s always a need for more diversity and yet it brings nothing but racial tension and animosity.</p>
<p>They just can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t accept the fact that racial realism will always defeat their &#8220;One World&#8221; fantasy.</p>

		<p>I used to feel sorry for these kids when watching those old clips. After being in the military and in units with a lot of blacks, I don&rsquo;t feel so sorry for them any longer.</p>

		<p>What happened at Little Rock was the clearest example of tyranny ever seen in the United States:<br>
A clear majority of the whites who went to that school, and their parents, obviously didn&rsquo;t want blacks living in their neighbourhood, nor going to their school.<br>
Therefore the government decided to FORCE these blacks onto the whites.<br>
And the blacks decided to FORCE themselves onto the majority of whites who didn&rsquo;t want them - who CLEARLY didn&rsquo;t want them.</p>
<p>Yet somehow the white people are bad? When did they FORCE themselves onto any of those blacks? Why don&rsquo;t the blacks want to live around their own people?</p>
<p>I think we all know the answer to that one&hellip;</p>

		<p>The source of black-white animosity goes back to at least the post Civil War era.  This is a quote from a former teacher, R C Murray, who has a book called &#8220;Legally STUPiD&#8221;, about what happened after the war:</p>
<p>&#8220;Southern children were forcibly removed from their homes, separated from their family and Bible and placed in public school classrooms where textbooks would soon be telling them their fathers were all racists who nearly destroyed the nation.  Believing this lie, many white Southerners felt obliged to accommodate that stereotype.  In separate schools, black children were taught to distrust and hate their white neighbors, the source of their continued oppression.  Tension between the races was important in order to distract all Southerners from realizing what was really happening.  Southerners were being systematically brainwashed – conditioned – like Pavlov&rsquo;s dog.  Even those liberty-loving Baptists that dominated the Southern landscape and culture willingly sacrificed their children and set aside their Bible in obedience to the government school god.&#8221;<br>
(from <a href="http://www.voicefromthepews.com/page.cfm?id=100)" rel="nofollow">http://www.voicefromthepews.com/page.cfm?id=100)</a></p>
<p>From all his articles I&rsquo;ve read, the author has no axe to grind, except for the demented school policies that end up denying a real education to black and white alike.</p>

		<p>Who in the hell is this person to tell me or anybody else who I should associate with?  I had some white tour guide tell me one time that there was something terribly wrong if any white person didn&rsquo;t have at least one minority friend.  That it just wasn&rsquo;t right and that white people who don&rsquo;t have minority friends are ignorant.  </p>
<p>Yeah right and in my entire life, I can honestly say that I have never had a minority friend, nor have my children and our lives have been the better for it.</p>

This was a great community in the 50&rsquo;s .Didn&rsquo;t take long for integration to ruin area&rsquo;s like this all over the country.About every year they celebrate how great this event was at Little Rock Central. They just better not venture to far from the campus when they celebrate it.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;A lack of diversity in people&rsquo;s personal lives breeds ignorance, she said, and ignorance &mdash; especially willful ignorance &mdash; breeds racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s just totally backwards.  People with no experience of blacks have no reason to loathe them.   As for ignorance, well, I know as much about blacks as I want to, &amp; for me the lesson is: Avoid them as much as possible.   </p>

		<p>It seems to me that since desegration didn&rsquo;t work out very well, what the Powers that be are trying to do, these days, is to turn as many white kids as possible into what is called wiggers, so they may get along better with Blacks, after having absorbed their particular form of popular culture.</p>

		<p>In order for a race or ethnic group to evolve it has to create its own society unique to its talents and tastes.  Being dependent on another race for economic aid hurts the pride of Blacks, which makes them resent Whites and act out their anger with anti-social behavior, which makes politicians think Blacks need more aid, which hurts the pride of Blacks &hellip;.</p>
