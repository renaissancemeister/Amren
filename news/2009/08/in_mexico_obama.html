			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Branigin, Washington Post, August 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama, attending a North American summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, vowed Monday to pursue comprehensive U.S. immigration reform later this year with a view to enacting legislation in 2010 that would provide a &#8220;pathway to citizenship&#8221; for millions of illegal immigrants in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asked about the prospects for immigration reform in view of the blows to his administration over health care legislation and mid-term elections next year, Obama dismissed the idea that the elections would play a role, saying he would not act &#8220;on short-term political calculations.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he regards immigration reform as being in the long-term interest of the United States. &#8220;We have a broken immigration system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nobody denies it.&#8221; Continuing on the current path means tensions with Mexico, danger for those trying to cross into the United States illegally, unfairness for those trying to immigrate legally, exploitation by unscrupulous employers, the depression of U.S. wages and other ills, Obama said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not fair, and it&rsquo;s not right, and we&rsquo;re going to change it,&#8221; he said. But he said it was &#8220;very important for us to sequence these big initiatives in way where they don&rsquo;t all just crash at the same time.&#8221; He said meetings have begun on immigration reform among House and Senate Democrats and Republicans, with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano coordinating the discussions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would anticipate that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and Senate, who are ready to move this forward,&#8221; Obama said. Then, next year, &#8220;we should be in a position to start acting,&#8221; he said, although he acknowledged that &#8220;this is going to be difficult.&#8221; The overhaul would give illegal immigrants in the United States the opportunity &#8220;to achieve a pathway to citizenship so that they don&rsquo;t have to live in the shadows,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;So I&rsquo;m confident we can get it done.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Our immigration system is broken because we do not enforce our own laws - the current ones.  Our immigration system is broken because we haven&rsquo;t updated our laws in light of current realities (the 1965 act needs to be changed).</p>
<p>After The US goes through Chapter 13 will we become &#8220;America - a division of Mexico&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Can we assume that such immigration reforms will allow any and all white Americans who wish to relocate to Mexico to do so without hassle and paperwork?  I mean, this is going to work both ways, right?</p>

		<p>I think the President is really trying to say that he&rsquo;s waiting for the economy to turn around, because there will be even more opposition to &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; than there would be because of the nonsense of letting more people in during a bad economy.</p>
<p>I have never understood the concept of a &#8220;security and prosperity partnership&#8221; with Mexico.  It&rsquo;s what they call an oxymoron   &mdash;   when you throw in with Mexico, you get neither security nor prosperity.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re damned right it&rsquo;s going to be difficult. I for one won&rsquo;t stand for it. These raucous town hall meetings you&rsquo;re seeing now will pale in comparison&hellip;Now is the time to stand together. If this Reform measure passes it will be the end of us all</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t want the immigrants in the &#8220;shadows&#8221; referred to by Obama either. I want them back in their home country or if they have criminal records, I want them in a harsh prison.</p>
<p>This is important. Obama wants a black/brown majority that will grow and grow as new immigrants from all over Africa and Latin America swamp the land.   </p>
<p>He will be the &#8220;Leader&#8221;, the kind of Castro or Mobutu these savage masses are used to and need. These immigrants can&rsquo;t cope with educated democracy. They seek to be led by a Leader who will feed them and indulge their barbarian desires and their hatred of whites.</p>
<p> That man is Obama.  </p>
<p>Moreover, watch out for Judases like McCain and Graham, Ben Nelson and others who will want &#8220;reasonable&#8221; compromises. </p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;reform&#8221;, we must pass the SAVE act that dozens of members of Congress have already sponsored which will get these freeloaders OUT.</p>

		<p>You know, even in my most cynical of veins, I had hoped that this &ldquo;magic mulatto&rdquo;  and Marxist &ldquo;messiah&rdquo; really was not the absolute idiot that I presumed him to be. After all, the USA is my country and like it or not, he is the General Secretary of it; however, he proves here and now, that he not only meets my beneath pessimistic expectations for him and his administration, but actually exceeds them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continuing on the current path means tensions with Mexico, danger for those trying to cross into the United States illegally, unfairness for those trying to immigrate legally, exploitation by unscrupulous employers, the depression of U.S. wages and other ills, Obama said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the answer to all this, is a &ldquo;pathway to citizenship&rdquo; for the 20 to 30 million alien invaders?</p>
<p>Somehow, I am comforted by the fact that this abject mockery of our political system is in the White House, since it proves everything I have ever believed about his race a whole in general and his utterly worthless comrades (regardless of race) in particular. If they were charged with putting out a fire, they would attach their hoses to gasoline tanks!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that this mentally challenged president doesn&rsquo;t understand that amnesty will be devestating to blacks.  Too, I think he stupidly believes this malarkey about blacks and browns being under the same umbrella, or at least that he can put them there.</p>
<p>But his biggest, latest blunder is something nobody caught when he said it, talking about the town hall meeting protestors.</p>
<p>He said something to the effect that it was &#8220;they&#8221; who had made the healthcare mess, and it was him who had to clean up after &#8220;them.&#8221;  Did the white healthcare protestors create the healthcare mess?  Of course not.  What is he talking about then, when he refers to &#8220;them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously when he speaks of &#8220;them,&#8221; he&rsquo;s talking about whites in general.  Another racist slip when he&rsquo;s under pressure just like the Gates slip.  What he is saying is that whites created the mess, and he&rsquo;s going to have to clean it up, so they have no business complaining about anything.  He said he &#8220;wants them to shut up.&#8221; </p>
<p>I wote Glenn Beck, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, Sean Hannity, and Boortz pointing that out, but I think the only one close to really understanding it is Beck and Hannity, and one of them might point that out on their shows.  I hope so.  It&rsquo;s blatant racism.  There&rsquo;s no equivocation.  This man reveals his hatred for whites constantly, and it should be mentioned very often and known by all.  He is the personification of hate, prejudice and evil.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned just that in businesses like convenience stores, hardwares, feed stores, etc., and have been surprised to see the clerks nod in full approval, with a couple adding their own dissatisfaction with his black bias.  I didn&rsquo;t think others had reached that level of awareness yet.</p>
<p>The tide just might be turning against this lying Reverend Wright, Jr.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it more than once, but it bears repeating:  Wait until this man is frustrated by defeats or insurmountable hurdles and he will crack and reveal very often his hatred of white people and his pro-black agenda and will take on the tone of the ghetto black.</p>

		<p>Mr. Obama is trying to coordinate immigration Amnesty with his health care reform so that all those &#8220;new Americans&#8221; coming to the US for their citizenship will not have to wait in line for their face lifts and Knee replacements. No more waiting in the Emergency rooms for those who have been brave enough to climb over the &#8220;virtual fence&#8221;, thanks to the generous President they can go directly to the Cleveland Clinic to for their tummy tucks and gastric bypasses.</p>

		<p>I am against violence of any type but it&rsquo;s obvious this man is intent on calling out the people that are adamant about objecting to the plans for a NWO. I think this was the plan all along. I think this was the reason he was deliberately put in the office of president. Is there anyone else besides me that can actually see that those that are pushing the NWO need to agitate the populace to separate the doers from the non-doers? That they need to finally &lsquo;force&rsquo; the percentage of the populace that will actually physically &lsquo;do something&rsquo; out into the street? That&rsquo;s what Alinsky advocated. Agitate and identify then isolate. I think it was more than just &lsquo;him&rsquo; that was following the &lsquo;Alinsky playbook&rsquo;. This goes beyond party affiliation.<br>
This situation was orchestrated to well. It&rsquo;s just to smooth to have been just pure &lsquo;happenstance.&rsquo;<br>
This doesn&rsquo;t look good people. I&rsquo;m sorry but I think the goose has been cooked. And now is the time the bird is about to be served on the table. God help us all. <br>

		<p>This will never stop unless WE stop it once and for all. If they legalize these illegals then say goodbye to America and what she stands for. We will never be able to take this country back and it will be permanently changed forever. Our poor children. What have we done to them?</p>

		<p>Obama claims that America has a broken immigration system, yet he plans to embark on providing a &#8216;pathway to citizenship&rsquo; for millions of illegal aliens (aliens, not immigrants!). Isn&rsquo;t that sort of like admitting that your electrical wiring is shot, yet at the same time promising your kids all sorts of plug-in electrical gadgets just so they can feel good about themselves? Or like admitting that your house is infested with cockroaches, yet to avoid tripping on your wife&rsquo;s sensibilities, you inform her that she can continue to leave foodstuffs unsealed and drop crumbs all over the floor? In other words, no logic whatsoever, and you&rsquo;re admitting to the problem, yet the steps you take are only making things worse. Obama certainly has the gift of gab&hellip; it&rsquo;s a shame he can&rsquo;t see the contradictions in his statements.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s in the interest of Obama and his fellow politicos who want to keep their power by getting these illegals to vote and it&rsquo;s in the interest of Big Business who can have an endless supply of cheap labor. It is NOT in the interest of the American people.</p>

		<p>This is insane. Our President goes to a foreign country and apologizes to them for taking in enough of their undesirables? He abases himself and us by describing our immigration system as &#8220;broken&#8221;? </p>
<p>Where oh where is Mexico&rsquo;s culpability in all this? Why are we so terrified of offending our southern neighbors? If Barry wants to describe a &#8220;broken&#8221; system he better start with Mexico.</p>

		<p>I wonder if blacks will ever realize their hero is hurting them most when he tries to bring in and legalize millions of low skill Mexicans. Probably they won&rsquo;t. Obama and most of the politicans are determined to destroy traditional America and I&rsquo;m afrain they&rsquo;re going to get it done. The country is already badly overcrowded with low skill non English speakers but politicans like Obama just don&rsquo;t give a damn. The only hope is a revolution but the country is already too fragmented for that. And the destruction of America will probably be led by a president who is not qualified for the office. So sad. </p>

		<p>Obama said, like all Democrats do, and many Republicans do, that we have an immigration system that&rsquo;s broken. Aha. The hard truth is, every single politician, individual citizen, businesses, chambers of commerce,churches, including the President himself, who argue this way, are all in denial. In fact, existing U.S. immigration law, Title 8 Section 1325, says and I paraphrase, it is against U.S. Immigration law to transport, employ, house, or in any way, facilitate the stay of an illegal foreign national in the U.S. and those who do are violating U.S. immigration law, and will be fined accordingly.</p>
<p>Conclusion: all of the people listed above, including the President, are violating existing U.S. immigration law, and should be punished according. These people have decided they are a law unto themselves.</p>

		<p>The Demcratic party is the party of foriegners. The strategy of the Demoratic party is to import as many foriegners as possible who will in turn vote for more foriegners. In other words, the Demcratic party is so unpopular among Native Born White  American voters that it has to import its voters.</p>
<p>The Democratic party is openly pursuing a policy of race-replacing the majority Native Born White American majority with non-whie foreigners. The Democraic party is openly waging a vicious race war against the majority Native Born White American majority.</p>
<p>Every hindu and sihk you see off the boat can go into the voting booth and vote to make the majority Native Born White American a racial minoirity withn the borders of America. And vote against US they do. Although you would never know this if you listen to Roy Beck and numbersusa.</p>

		<p>Do not be discouraged by the unprecedented number of Mexican illegals and Mexican legals (who support their illegal brethren) attempting to colonize America.  Once a relative handful of these enemy invaders and their fifth column allies have been reunited with their deceased ancestors the rest will return to Mexico in a mass exodus unparralled in human history&hellip;  </p>

		<p>My take on this is that this Obama character will do virtually anything to assure himself a second term because so much more can be accomplished after a few years in the job, learning whose a** to kiss and how much money each country wants to play by your rules. Thus, a second term will ensure much more of his NWO plan being sneaked through. However, I don&rsquo;t think he quite counted on such a raucous opposition quite so early in his administration as the health care issue, coming right on the heels of a critical economic nosedive along with bank failures, mortgage crunch, and unemployment. Perhaps this is the perfect storm to finally wake up the sleeping Right, although it may indeed be too late.</p>
<p>As far as illegals taking jobs from blacks, the big O doesn&rsquo;t care any more about blacks than he does whites - he is working on a much, much larger picture. Being one of the &#8216;Rulers of the World&rsquo; is much more lucrative and powerful than &#8216;The Black Leader&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Obama is on the same path Bush 1, Bush 2, and Clinton were on - to dismantle all the centers of strength in traditional patriotic America, and make this nation internationally economically dependent, culturally diluted, and genetically intermixed with other nationalities. Thus is the method by which popular democratic control of government is being subtly phased out and the population of the United States made ready for a decades-long planned ultimate transition of our country into a new world &#8220;order,&#8221; the dictates over which no single population will have either control or redress.   </p>

		<p>Let me urge ALL our readers and friends to get active on local blogs and the like. We have to, we NEED to get as many American people thinking and involved, as possible. With respect to the criminal illegal immigrants. Too many people are still ambivalent about the illegal immigrants. People who have not experienced them at their worst. People who don&rsquo;t understand the hidden costs of illegal immigration. To whit, supporting these parasites with our tax dollars. Having to put up with their endless crimes and the social problems they create.</p>

		<p> I feel sorry for my people who have to worry about immigration and the effects it will have on their grandchildren. They will never know how beautiful the country was in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s. Our politicians should be looking out for us, instead of having us worry about it. They should have taken care of this problem so the average joe could relax. But our politicians seem to despise white people. </p>

		<p>My view on this is Obama is probably taking the forever backfiring philosophy that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So after black and brown team up in great numbers to destroy western culture the remaining blacks can hang around to destroy Latin culture. Actually this may work. It has every where else. Sad!</p>

<p>We/I have won many immigration battles, learn from White folks who have experience doing what works. Don&rsquo;t just rant or stockpile guns.</p>
<p>Train with local people on the best way to contact, influence decision makers.</p>
<p>I have excellent success networking with Congressional Staff members - when you get to know the staff members by name and approach them in an intelligent manner, you will have influence.</p>
<p>I have the Congressional staff directory for all US Senators/Congressmen. The annual subscription is expensive, so I would like to share it with others here, also share successful techniques.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my email:</p>

<p>Oh, if only this were so.  Unfortunately many politicians who voted for the last amnesty bill a couple of years ago are still with us, included Ted Kennedy, John McCain, Arlen Spector, Nancy Pelosi, etc.  That sad truth is that while most Americans oppose illegal immigration they keep voting for the traitors that favor it.</p>

<p>This is true. It was the rising up of the American people that last defeated the amnesty attempt under Bush. If the people hadn&rsquo;t done this, we&rsquo;d already have amnesty. I glad this health care bill is riling people up, it will make it harder for amnesty to be pushed through.</p>
<p>PS-Read parts of the healthcare bill online. It is shocking. It openly tells the elderly to commit suicide to cut costs as well as well as allowing the government to look into anyone&rsquo;s bank account, dictating to doctors what they can do, it&rsquo;s scary really etc. It&rsquo;s total government control. It goes ways beyond healthcare. The bill is HR 3200.  Read parts of it.</p>

		<p> I believe future historians will look at this era and come to the conclusion that the demise of the white race in America began on Sep. 24, 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas. President Eisenhower ordered fully armed combat troops from Fort Campbell, Kentucky to quell the white protestors attempting to stop forced school intergration.<br>
 I have been in the military and fully understand the truly awesome power that can be brought to bear on people.A well armed, trained infantry platoon can wreak havoc on civilians with a minimum of loss to the unit.<br>
 Eisenhower was a four star General (he was later made a 5 star) when he was the SACEUR( Supreme Allied Commander of the European Theatre of operations) during WW II. So he knew full well what he was doing. In my mind, this act is totally unforgiveable.</p>

<p>A well-armed, trained infantry platoon would be annihilated by a force of well-armed American civilians.  As evidenced by the Vietnam War; the American military was no match for a nation of determined 90-pound rice farmers..  I fought in that war and speak from experience&hellip;<br>
