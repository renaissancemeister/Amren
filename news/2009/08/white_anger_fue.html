			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Swift and Josh Richman, San Jose Mercury News, August 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Many say the tempest over health care has its origin in the new administration&rsquo;s breathtaking pace of change and in the long-term social and demographic trends that helped put the nation&rsquo;s first African-American president in the White House.</p>
<p>But there is also a powerful social catalyst: The recession has savaged whites and middle-aged men to a degree unseen in most people&rsquo;s lifetimes. And that has helped make many in those groups desperately, angrily anxious about change.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Surging emotions</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationwide, there have been other signs of the Angry White Man phenomenon. The numbers of racial hate groups and anti-government citizen militias are surging. Guns sales appear to be climbing. Complaints of racial discrimination in much of the Bay Area and across the country are running higher than they have in at least a decade.</p>
<p>Even the Berkeley-based Sierra Club&rsquo;s Internet comment boards recently erupted in a debate by members, hardly a conservative group, over whether the club was attacking whites, after it posted a member newsletter about its diversity program with the headline: &#8220;Yep, We&rsquo;re Too White.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week in San Jose, near an appearance by Sen. Barbara Boxer, predominantly white &#8220;tea party&#8221; protesters chanting, &#8220;USA, USA!&#8221; held up signs superimposing Obama alongside Adolf Hitler. One sign said Boxer should be bounced from office because she is &#8220;condescending to black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of it is not about health care, let&rsquo;s face it,&#8221; said Richard Czik, former vice president of governmental affairs for the National Association of Evangelicals, a health care reform advocate who is organizing a moderate Christian association called the New Evangelicals. &#8220;Some of it has to be about an obvious rejection of Obama&rsquo;s legitimacy as president. You wouldn&rsquo;t get this anger, represented by the hate-mongering you see. Some of it is directed against the president, with some pretty deep-seated attitudes.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Not about race</b></p>
<p>Some Bay Area opponents of health care reform acknowledge many of their supporters are over 50 and are white, but they argue that their sole concern is preserving quality health care.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not a racial issue,&#8221; said Bridget Melson, a Pleasanton psychotherapist who helped organize a protest Saturday outside the district office of Rep. Jerry McNerney, D-Pleasanton.</p>
<p>Some experts say one reason why so many health care protesters have been white is that, at least until now, Latinos, blacks, American Indians and Asian-Americans have had a much higher risk of being uninsured than whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the people who are probably most concerned about any changes relating to health care reform are moderately satisfied, willing to keep the status quo in place,&#8221; said health economist Stephen Zuckerman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute&rsquo;s Health Policy Center in Washington, D.C. &#8220;And it is the case that minority populations tend to be uninsured, so they have more to gain from reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8220;But we&rsquo;re not.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Still, the economy has given many whites and middle-aged Americans legitimate reason to feel angry, fearful or threatened. This recession has taken a far larger share of jobs from older men, particularly white men, than earlier economic downturns.</p>
<p>During the six decades since World War II, the unemployment rate for men aged 55 and older averaged 3.7 percent, and reached 7 percent in only a single month  &mdash;  February 1950, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>Then came 2009.</p>
<p>So far this year, the monthly unemployment rate for men over 55 has been almost double the historical average.</p>
<p>At 6.7 percent and 6.5 percent during the first two quarters of 2009, the unemployment rate for older white men is higher than it&rsquo;s ever been since the government began tracking that group, in the early 1950s. Unemployment rates for black and Latino men, however, are lower than the peak they hit during the recession of the early 1980s.</p>
<p><b>Tensions are rising</b></p>
<p>Aside from the health care debate, there are numerous signs that racial tension may be on the rise.</p>
<p>The federal government has noted a 25 percent uptick in complaints of racial discrimination since 2006. In the Bay Area, Santa Clara County numbers were down, but Alameda and Contra Costa counties recorded 10-year highs for racial complaints in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a recent column, Buchanan said the recession&rsquo;s unprecedented impact on older men, particularly whites, is helping to fuel the outcry over health care reform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Different nation</b></p>
<p>But America is a very different place demographically than it was at the start of the Clinton administration, when three-quarters of Americans were white. Some say some of the tension in the nation&rsquo;s civic dialogue has something to do with fear about how immigration and time are remaking the nation&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Today, under two-thirds of Americans are white, while California went from being nearly 60 percent white in 1990 to just over 40 percent white today. Even in Orange County, ground zero for California conservatism, whites are no longer a majority of the population, according to U.S. Census estimates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those whites that you see at the health care meetings, that was really Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s America,&#8221; said John Kenneth White, a presidential scholar at the Catholic University of America and author of the newly published &#8220;Barack Obama&rsquo;s America: How New Conceptions of Race, Family and Religion Ended the Reagan Era.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reagan&rsquo;s California exists today only on the commemorative license plate. That California that elected him governor twice and president twice is no more,&#8221; White said. He believes some of the anger behind the health care debate is from &#8220;a sense that power has shifted in the country, and the country they thought they knew doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.&#8221;<br>

<p>If the U.S. goes mulatto like Mexico and central America, it will cease to be.  As the NPI states:</p>
<p>&#8220;America is the unique and irreplaceable product of centuries of specific racial, historical, and cultural identities&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;America and its cultural and political identity will endure only so long as the identities that created it and sustain it endure, and when they die, America will die.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Am I missing something?  The writer argues that this recession is different and now all these white people are losing their jobs and are now more likely than before to be in the same boat as blacks and hispanics, that is to be without health insurance.  This is given as the reason for their anger and their activism.  So, why are they protesting AGAINST Obamacare?  If they are more vulnerable, and now more like the victims of capitalism and conservatives and &#8220;the man,&#8221; then why aren&rsquo;t they acting more like blacks and hispanics and clamoring for more and more government redistribution of wealth?  </p>

<p>How laughable!</p>
<p>I once remember reading that any given socioeconomic/political entity (be it a: city, school, neighborhood, county, hospital, shopping mall, state, television station, or a country) that was once overwhelmingly white dominated, begins to become unstable and undesirable once the 70% mark is passed and that white dominance becomes subjected to growing nonwhite incursions and fancies. The USA is now about only 65% white and has been under 70% white (69.1% to be precise) since the turn of the century. And just look where we are at both politically and economically; we are hardly enjoying the &ldquo;riches&rdquo; of diversity and change, but are instead fast becoming a rainbow retrograde Weimar Republic. </p>
<p>Our elites decided it was best to &ldquo;elect&rdquo; a new population and call it a &ldquo;windfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people they hoped to replace remain 200 million strong and are just beginning to awaken to their treason; while the &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; of their new hodgepodge of Third World wonders, dreams of the day they replace them totally. </p>
<p>Not the best sandwich bun to be the hamburger patty in, Comrades!<br>

		<p> In all the things I read, watch, listen to and discuss; I&rsquo;ve never heard the phrase that the NAACP is &#8220;too black&#8221; or the Hispanics say &#8221; La Raza&#8221; is too Hispanic. Yet I constantly read about people saying that this organization or that group is &#8220;too white.<br>
 The phrase divide and conquoer immediately jumps to my mind every time I hear or read it.</p>

		<p> Typical American journalism of the 21st Century, in that it tries to explain away very legitimate anger and frustration on the part of White Americans by calling it &#8220;racism,&#8221; or at least strongly suggesting that that&rsquo;s what it is. And what&rsquo;s with the part about the 25 percent rise in complaints of racial discrimination since 2006? If that&rsquo;s true, why didn&rsquo;t the writer get specific about who is complaining about &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; and who is allegedly committing it? And while I&rsquo;m on a roll, who anointed the Southern Poverty Law Center as the official &#8220;hate group designator&#8221; for the liberal news media?</p>
<p> One last point: Speaking of things that have negatively impacted us European-Americans since the Mulatto Messiah took over the White House, what about the announcement today that we won&rsquo;t be getting any Social Security cost of living increases next year or the year after? Whites make up a higher percentage of people 65 and over than their overall percentage in the population. Do you suppose there could be more to this than just the alleged &#8220;negative inflation&#8221; which is what the COLAs are supposed to be based on? Hmmm &hellip; </p>

		<p>But the health care debate is about race.</p>
<p>Barack Hussein Obama is trying to shift health care resources from those who have paid into the system for 40-years (white seniors citizens) to 12 - 20 million younger illegal aliens of Indian decent who are freeloading on every social benefit this country has to offer. </p>
<p>In Obama&rsquo;s eyes, this is the great equalization. <br>

<p>Racial tensions are indeed rising, and gun sales not only &#8220;appear to be rising, but mostly white people are buying up arms and ammo at rates that are creating shortages.  If this screwy reporter thinks it&rsquo;s an Angry White Man phenomenen, he&rsquo;s as out of touch with reality as the rest of the leftist fools that walk around in LaLa land.  And he&rsquo;s just as much of a fool for trying to convince anyone that this entire display of anger is just a thing that involves people over 55.</p>
<p>Many of the town hall protestors we see on t.v. seem to be late middle age and retirees, but a very large portion of the dissenters of everything about Obama and his pro-black plans are people of every age, with the exception of the twenties/early thirties crowd.  They&rsquo;re some involved, but I would say at least half of the protestors throughout the country, protesting cap and trade as much as healthcare reform would probably be somewhere in their forties.  Certainly the militias are mostly late thirties to forties people.</p>
<p>There is one important ommision, however, that the reporter made, and that is more mainline pundits and commentators are beginning to use the &#8220;C&#8221; word with greater frequency than ever before.</p>
<p>The bottom line to all this, however, is what a town hall protestor announced just recently, &#8220;You have awakened the sleeping giant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed they have and it is my opinion that we are in the first stages of revolution, and if the arrogant Obama gives them more of his in-your-face, pro-black programs and doesn&rsquo;t back down, our course will continue along the lines of rebellion.</p>
<p>Professor Roubini just declared that indications are that we will be hitting a double dip recession that will resemble a W rather than a V.</p>
<p>This Marxist president may well be the greatest failure in history, and it isn&rsquo;t beyond the pale to consider that he could well be forced to resign.  If so, blacks will rise up all over the country.</p>

Even in Orange County, ground zero for California conservatism, whites are no longer a majority of the population, according to U.S. Census estimates.&#8221;</p>
<p>For well over 40 years, whites in this nation and in every other dominant white nation have been warned repeatedly and loudly by the handful of white men who stuck their necks out, and who took the risks associated with challenging this Communist inspired ideology known as Cultural Marxism - and only a tiny percentage of whites heard those warnings and did their best to help their fellow kinsman and kinswomen wake up to the future that we see now unfolding in America.</p>
<p>The rest of the whites ignored these warnings, shunned the white leaders cited above - and kept watching their Cosby Family TV shows and believing the Cultural Marxist baloney about how blacks and other minorities were just like us and that we shouldn&rsquo;t be concerned with being displaced and then subjugated to rule by non-white minorities - because nothing of significance would change.</p>
<p>You know what?  The whites in the former Rhodesia were sold the very same crock of baloney, and they swallowed it, too.  So, the next time you hear any leftist or AdL or SPLC spokesman vomit out the standard smear words &#8216;white supremacist&rsquo; - have a good laugh, fellow AR readers.  Because, just as Sam Dickson has said on numerous occasions, there is nothing at all &#8216;superior&rsquo; or &#8216;supreme&rsquo; about a race of idiots who are too dumb to face the truth about racial reality.</p>
<p>Only the white race could be convinced that it is somehow &#8216;immoral&rsquo; to be concerned about their ethnic survival.</p>

		<p>If there are &#8216;angry white males&#8221; it is way overdue.  Never before in history has a country been demographically savaged like the US has without a declared war.  We are told we must become multicultural when in reality the elites want whites removed from the scene.  The western hemisphere is overwhelming Hispanic.  From Mexico to Chile.  If anyone REALLY believed in multicuralism the US would stay majority white and English speaking (as would Canada outside of Quebec which would stay French).  Why in heavens name white men keep joining the military I don&rsquo;t know.  To keep America safe for Mexicans?  To be discriminated against in the work place when they come home?  To be politically powerless?  Even VA medical care is on the chopping block.  And white men are put on the front lines while blacks get support roles.  Anger is way overdue.</p>

		<p>Typical leftist smokescreen. </p>
<p>President Obama proposes a ridiculous health care plan that wreaks to its very core of socialism. He gets called on it by the people who will most likely suffer the greatest consequences from its imposition. </p>
<p>Not only that, but that same group is quite different from the blindly obedient, robotic sycophants that he&rsquo;s accustomed to surrounding himself with. </p>
<p>All of a sudden, town halls are full of people for whom the &#8220;messianic rock star&#8221; effect means little. These folks want hard facts, a concept that Barack &#8220;I vote present&#8221; Obama has little familiarity with. </p>
<p>Enter stage left: A zombie-like horde of hapless liberal wordsmiths, quickly deflecting any fact-based analysis of the president&rsquo;s plan with accusations of &#8220;angry white men&#8221; and &#8220;a fear of shifting power.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see a way through any of this. What&rsquo;s the right path out of this headlong rush to marginalize - and eliminate - all concern for white people&rsquo;s rightful place as an equal at the table? </p>

		<p>This article, of course, is written by people who like these trends and wish to sow despair amongst us. While the demographic trends are real, they are not irreversible. There are methods that Whites can use even as a minority. Home schooling, fighting anti-American and anti-Western peopaganda and hirings in colleges, universities and media, boycots, and various forms of &#8216;strike&rsquo; (since a lot of the abilities that power the infrastructure, technology and social structures inhere in the European-American population). Given sufficient determination, it is possible to regain cultural and political control, at which point more steps can be taken. California, and other states, can be reclaimed. But all this requires much effort and sacrifice of short-term gratification. Perhaps the Obama regime&rsquo;s yoke is odious enough for true Americans to spark the requisite motivation levels among them.</p>

		<p>Cut the psychoanalysis out. The Obama health plan stinks. Wrecks the overall excellent private health insurance system we have; adds over a trillion in cost to insure a relatively small number of uninsured people, including illegal aliens.  It&rsquo;s not racial stupid. Count your pennies. Obama&rsquo;s love of govt bureaucracy smothers anything that is good, whether it&rsquo;s for blacks or whites.</p>

		<p>I am sure white anger is fueling the health care debate, but it is wasted energy.  They are missing the opportunity to get some really good changes made - or else they like having a set of private corporations reamin beyond that law, living big, while cutting their coverage and charging them more.  Perhaps they enjoy seeing their doctors drive up in a mercedes or porche and hear about their second home or their travels to Europe and the golf weekend at Cabo while they struggle to make their co-pay and insurance premiums.  </p>
<p>Instead of parroting the nonsensical arguments that Obama (or anyone) could easily expose as nonsense, they could be focusing on how he will likely use immigration reform to cover the illegals in the country now.  Or they could confront him on the method of awarding grants to medical schools based on minority recruitment.  Instead, they are painting posters with toothbrush moustaches and shouting silly, meaningless slogans that only illustrate how misinformed they are, like a buch of Cold War McCarthyist holdovers - wild-eyed and paranoid.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t doing anything to help the white survival cause, and it isn&rsquo;t even helping whites.  </p>

		<p>Having written my comments about the wasted engergy of the health care debate, I would like to present the idea that it would be helpful if the whites who are so angry would do some introspection, identify what they are really angry about, and realize that they are angry about race issues, including the usurpation of the government and the duplicity of the media in favor of &#8220;minorities,&#8221; etc., by special interest groups that for decades have eroded government function to the point that it has allowed the majority to be disenfranchised.  They could be complaining about not being represented at all, even though they are still the majority.  </p>
<p>But it would require that big leap into the arena of race.  As long as everyone (nearly) is fearful of confronting the issue of race and usurpation of a majority white nation by minorities and their politicos, it will not happen.  Moronic scenes such as those at the town hall meetings, will continue.  At some point, that will no longer do.  Then, we may get down to business.</p>

		<p>Can anyone say with a straight face that California is a better place to live now that whites are a minority? No they can&rsquo;t and as the saying goes &#8220;as goes California, so goes the nation&#8221; so is there any wonder there is anger out there about this situation. I live next door in Nevada and see the same things that ruined that state now ruining this one. It&rsquo;s like a cancer and I blame the US government for introducing it and allowing it to spread. As far as I am concerned this government has given up any rights to legitimacy.</p>

The MSM will just have get use to it. Even Mort Zuckerman, on the McLaughlin report, obliquely referred to the racial extortion apect in Obama&rsquo;s health care reform.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Reagan&rsquo;s California exists today only on the commemorative license plate. That California that elected him governor twice and president twice is no more,&rdquo; White said.

<p>No kidding Sherlock! Could that also be due to the fact that several million Whites have LEFT Mexifornia leaving it to the Mexican invaders?  Could the million or so Whites leaving and taking their incomes have anything to do with the $27 billion dollar deficit?

		<p>The demographic face of America has changed so rapidly in only 30 years, since the 1965 Immigration Act (sponsored by Ted Kennedy and the later apologetic Eugene McCarthy) that the change qualifies under the UN&rsquo;s definition of genocide. Demographers say that the percentages remained constant for nearly 300 years on the North American continent, being: 85-90% whites (of Eureopean descent) and the remaining ~15% being split between Native Americans and black slaves, BUT in only ~30 years, the ratios drastically changed. Kennedy and McCarthy promised that their Immig.Act would not change America. (And Europe is rapidly changing too  &mdash;  -where will OUR &#8220;homeland&#8221; be?)</p>

<p>Yup, the Republicans committed suicide for the benefit of their cheap labor loving corporate masters.  Reagan signed on to the first illegal alien amnesty and Bush was as much in favor of another amnesty as any Democrat.  (In Reagan&rsquo;s defense, he did later say that the amnesty was the biggest mistake he made.  But that realization came a little late.)

		<p>North America, whose population consists in by far the largest part of Germanic elements who mixed but little with the lower colored peoples, shows a different humanity and culture from Central and South America, where the predominantly Latin immigrants often mixed with the aborigines on a large scale. By this one example, we can clearly and distinctly recognize the effect of racial mixture. The Germanic inhabitant of the American continent, who has remained racially pure and unmixed, rose to be master of the continent; he will remain the master as long as he does not fall a victim to defilement of the blood&hellip;.<br>

		<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s health care plan is not exactly socialism. In fact it is a highly privatized health care system and there are many horror stories about the US privatized helath system. And I should also point out that the polls show consistently a lot of support for a single payer system.  The foremost authority on the single payer health care system is David Himmlestien of Harvard med school. Himmlestien argues that Obama&rsquo;s health care system does even come close to the single payer system of Euorope.</p>
<p>A single payer system is a medicare system. How many of you here are willing to boot your parents and people who are physically disabled-quadraplegics for example -off of medicare?</p>
<p>My late brother was quadraplegic and medicare took very good care off him.</p>
<p>Larger issue:The immigration enthusaists were lying all along. Thereis no economic benefit to mass immigtration of non-whites. Now they show their true intent:the main goal of post-1965 immigration policy is the race replacement of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Privatized health care is a disaster. </p>
<p>Go to Dr. Himmlestiens web site where all the lies about socialized medicine are disseceted and exposed.</p>

		<p>Most whites don&rsquo;t see the health care problems as a racial issue but the fact is that Obama basically is trying to spread out health care to everyone which can&rsquo;t be done without weakening it for a great many whites who can get relatively better care now.</p>
<p>Because of the average racial IQ gap, the root cause of the low social-economic status of blacks, non-blacks and blacks are essentially social &amp; political adversaries competing with each other for whats best for their group. There is no  way out of this competition and non-blacks (whites especially) need to face it and fight for their families whether it&rsquo;s health care, affirmative action, welfare, crime fighting, or whatever issue that is at bottom involves our unavoidable racial-group adversarial situation.</p>

		<p>There are so many excellent responses on this article that it would be impossible to list them all. Kudos Amren&rsquo;ers!</p>
<p>One thing that really bothers me is that number 65% or even 50% of this nation is White. I don&rsquo;t buy it for a second. That is only to pacify the Whites making them think they are still the majority. Since we know the census is rigged and many NON-whites classify themselves as &#8220;White&#8221; we should not buy into this lie any longer. If anything we are more like 45% of the population.</p>
<p> We have been FLOODED since 1965 with 3rd worlders and their birthrates far exceed ours. So how can we sit and repeat this lie over and again?  It is like saying there are still 12 million illegals (another lie) in this country. How long have they been saying this lie? That phoney 12 million lie has been put out there for YEARS and I suppose not ONE illegal has crossed over since then?  Let us stop repeating their lies.</p>

		<p>The following point can not be overemphasized:in a public debate on national tv and radio the terms of the debate must be comletetly defined in terms of the racial interests of Native Born White Americans. And the fundamental issue in this framework is this:Why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of the race-replacement at the hand of post-1965 asians,hispanics,muslims and africans? How is it in the interest of Native Born White Americans to be reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America? Then you can throw in all the other stuff of economic benefit and the ecosystion&hellip;integrated into this particular framing of the &#8220;debate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Post-1965 asians,muslims,africans and hispanics insiste that Native Born White Americans be morally even-handed in their approach to immigration..while at the same time post-1965 asians,hispanics,musllims and africans expect us to tolerate the very non-liberal non- even -handed debating position of post-1965 non-whites. Or, to put it in starker term,post-1965 asians,hispanics,muslims and africans are demanding that Native Born White Amerians commit racial suicide in the nation they founded and created. Native Born White Americans are under no obligation to commit racial sicide within the borders of America to make post-1965 asians,muslims,africans and hispancs happy.</p>

		<p>Great comments, mostly. The root cuase of 90% of American ills is immigration. Pure and simple. The 1965 immigriaotn act, if not repealed soon, will be the death knell for the US and the white US population.</p>
<p>Liberals, like this author, always start saying &#8220;fear&#8221; is the root cause of the upheaval by whites. This implies underlying racism and elicits a response of &#8220;I aint a scared&rsquo; by whites in an attepmt to kowtow whites into submission. Why else would a race that dominated a nation for so long willingly hand over their birthright and spoils to a bunch of invaders of differing races? Until we cure the root cause of our illness, immigration of non whites, we will continue down the path of destruction. And if we wait to long to act, our aging and apathetic white population will not be able to reverse the course.</p>

<p>Yes, Ronald Reagan, thank you not only for your one-time-only amnesty; but for your elimination of a federal civil service exam that required college graduates to read and write at a 12th grade level, because blacks with their affirmative action college degrees could not pass it, your enhanced enforcement of Nixon&rsquo;s &#8220;Philadelphia Plan&#8221; that served to eliminate whites from construction unions, and the slap in the face and kick in the rear you gave to the Whites who made you President.<br>

		<p>The protesters see the big push for changes in health care for what it is: a transfer of wealth and power from whites to non-whites.</p>
<p>I believe the protesters are basically tired of paying for everyone else. It is no longer enough to do one&rsquo;s best for his family, he now, must support everyone else&rsquo;s too. Paying taxes without a salary is pretty tough. Hopefully, the people who don&rsquo;t pay them now, but benefit enormously from them will find that out when Bad Whitey &#8216;ain&rsquo;t got no mo bread&rsquo; to share with him.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The whites in the former Rhodesia were sold the very same crock of baloney, and they swallowed it, too. So, the next time you hear any leftist or AdL or SPLC spokesman vomit out the standard smear words &lsquo;white supremacist&rsquo; - have a good laugh, fellow AR readers.&#8221;</p>
<p>How well I remember the crock of baloney known as the &#8220;quota system&#8221; when it first came out of the devil&rsquo;s cave known as the Federal Judiciary and US Senate led by the unspeakable Hubert Humphry and Ted Kennedy.  How could it hurt any Whites? Blacks are 12 percent of the population, let them have 12 percent of the jobs.  All it would mean is that Whites might have to apply for 10 jobs instead of 5.</p>
<p>I also very well remember October 1972.  My county agency planned to hold a promotional exam.  A meeting was held to explain things to those of us who planned to take the exam.</p>
<p>This was almost 4 years into Nixon&rsquo;s first term and his administration had been pushing affirmative action even worse than Democrats Johnson and later Carter did.  So several of us Whites asked what about affirmative action, how will that affect the exam?</p>
<p>We were actually told that since according to the 1970 census our county had only 9 percent blacks and our profession already had something like 22 percent blacks the quota system would not apply.  The blacks were over represented and that should keep Nixon&rsquo;s EEOC and the Federal Judges away.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t happen that way.  The test results were thrown out by a Nixon appointed Judge on the grounds of discrimination against the blacks who failed.  </p>
<p>In 1972 blacks were the only affirmative action group.  The Ford Foundation had not yet invented the hispanic race privileged to steal jobs from Whites on the grounds of racial preferences.</p>
<p>The agency is now about 90 percent minority.  The only whites are young gays, radicals and communists. About 1990 the agency stopped hiring blacks and began hiring  mostly hispanics with a few asians, middle easterners and pacific islanders thrown in.</p>
<p>The federal government began to eliminate Whites from the agency in the 1970&rsquo;s.  The federal government began to eliminate blacks from that agency in the 1990&rsquo;s. </p>

<p>Conservative Talk radio needs to be destroyed. </p>
<p>White Amerika needs to go back to when they were told what to think by Liberal newspapers and liberal TV.<br>
Liberal Prograssive ideas is what is best for Amerika.</p>
<p> We need more immigration, we can never have enough non assimilating people with less education than high a school dropout. When Obama gives the next Amnesty to 20 million illegal aliens ( undocumented nation Builders) that are already here they can bring in 80 million poor sick relatives, this will make us a wealthy country, anyone that disagrees is a racist.</p>
<p>We need to keep white people paying trillions for social programs to promote social justice. They should continue to pay trillions for a hundred more generations or until there are no more white people. Anyone that disagrees is a racist.</p>
<p>we need to never let white people forget only they can be racist. Anyone that disagrees is a racist.</p>

<p>We need to shut down the Internet as too may white people are starting to think that multiculturalism and Diversity and affirmative action tastes like Jim Jones kool aid. anyone that disagrees is a racist.</p>
<p>We need to only elect presidents in the future that go to churches where everyone there thinks white people are blue eyed devils and has a pastor and minister that spends his life promoting hate against white people but when the minister decides to move he moves his family into a 95 percent wealthy white community instead of the hood. Anyone that disagrees is a racist.</p>
<p>We need to stop the FBI from releasing crime statistics that show year after year that white people get killed by blacks  at a 100 to one ratio compared to blacks killed by whites, and white women are raped about a thousand times more often by blacks than blacks are raped by whites, These statistics are racist and ignore the structural societal nature of the problem and should be dismissed and never revealed as they are racist and imply whites are being targeted by blacks. Have we forgotten already only whites can be guilty of a hate crime?<br>
Anyone that disagrees is a racist.</p>
<p>We need to never let whitey off the hook for things white people did like buy slaves 300 years ago in an era when everybody else was buying slaves, while never mentioning black ancestors that sold black people to whitey 300 years ago or how whitey killed 600,000 other whiteys in a civil war to end slavery in Amerika yet slavery still exists in black Afrika. Anyone that disagrees is a racist.</p>
<p>We need to keep affirmative action going even though it no longer gives to ancestors of slaves in Amerika but now provides funding to any person of color that steps off a plane so in effect we are giving affirmative action to the world as any prograssive will tell you all the worlds problems are caused by whitey and he needs to keep paying, anyone that disagrees is a racist.</p>
<p>Finally, people that complain about Glenn Beck need to remember Beck looks an awful lot like frosty the Snowman. Everyone knows from attending college and being taught by progressives that even frosty the Snowman is a racist. anyone that disagrees is a racist.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Darn right that country is gone. Good job, Baby Boomers. Look what you&rsquo;ve wrought upon yourselves  &mdash;  and those of us that get to reap your harvest.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a word for this tactic of creating friction between age groups or generations. Remember &#8220;Rules for Radicals&#8221; polarize divide agitate. The agent provocateur posts a comment seemingly in agreement but cleverly creates division and in-fighting.</p>
<p>I have watched with stunned disbelief as if in a bad dream as my boomer contemporaries have embraced a suicidal radical indoctrination. It blows the mind, the plasticity of the human psychology and social behavior. It is frustrating to watch. In the 70&rsquo;s I was considered to be on the left (there were lots of propaganda directed towards young people), now the left has swung into such a bizarre extreme that I am relatively on a different political spectrum.</p>
<p>But know ye It is not only the boomers! Each new generation sees the hipsters, posers, glorifying in anarchism, communism, perversion, self mutilation as a fashion, the destruction of their heritage. </p>
<p>It is also the older ones that have passed this along to the boomers. It is a mistake to focus only on the boomers. This crosses generational lines and inciting inter-generational friction should be recognized for what it is:a method to divide and conquer.</p>
<p>THere are a wide variety of opinions from people young or old and cannot be blamed upon one age group. Beware the agent provocateur!</p>
<p>Beware the social brainwashing by experts in mind control and hypnosis employed by the media (tv, print, radio, advertising and yes even the entertainment industry). People are walking around in trances guided by experts in mass brainwashing.</p>
<p>The only defense is to think critically and beware being baited into agitation that creates ultimate self destruction.    </p>

		<p>Since we have our first black president, EVERYTHING is taking on racial overtones. Anything at all to do with the Presidency is now about race. What used to be about issues is now about the racial aspect of those issues. I laugh at all the blather about how now we have &#8216;transcended race&rsquo; because the U.S. has elected its first black president. Hah! On the contrary, having a black president has turned up to &#8216;boil&rsquo; what has for years only been on &#8216;simmer&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s going to get nasty.</p>
<p>This health care fiasco is full of hidden stabs at the people who are now paying for it. I have downloaded a copy of the plan, and at 1200 pages is a nightmare to read. However, I have noted that  paid health care for veterans will cease when they turn 65. This totalitarian garbage MUST be defeated. </p>

		<p>&#8220;But America is a very different place demographically than it was at the start of the Clinton administration, when three-quarters of Americans were white. Some say some of the tension in the nation&rsquo;s civic dialogue has something to do with fear about how immigration and time are remaking the nation&rsquo;s population&#8221;</p>
<p>WHEN DID THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE EVER AGREE TO ALLOW THIS DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSFORMATION TO HAPPEN?! The Answer: NEVER!!!!! If in 1965 the american public had been told that the Hart-Cellar immigration act would cause the country to go from being 89% white down to only 65% by 2009 and make whites an outright minority by the 2040s the act would have never passed in a million years. Instead, we had Ted Kennedy telling us that our country would NOT be flooded with 1 million immigrants yearly and that the ethnic mix would NOT be altered if the Act became law. So much for the notion that we live in a democracy, and if blacks and post 1965 immigrants ever start rioting like they did in France I hope the now silent and intimidated white majority will get the courage to place the blame where it belongs- the greedy businesses, ethnic lobbies,&rsquo;kumbaya&rsquo; church groups, and our lying, hypocritical rulers. </p>

		<p>The Corporate Liberal Media at least acknowledges that White Americans exist and that they are getting might angry. Roy Beck and numbersusa.com wont even acknowledge that Native Born White Americans exist. What a despicable organization. Everyone should understand that numbersusa.com makes the case for immigration refrom exclusively in terms of the interests of post-1965 asians,muslims,hispanics and africans.</p>
<p>Numbersusa is so eager to sit at the barganing table with the ant-white Kenyan bigot Barack OBama. Well,if he does get the chance to have a pow wow with Obama, their won&rsquo;t be any mention of the fact that Native Born White Americans exist and are being harmed by post-1965 immigration policy. But they have to be truly delusional to think that the probability of have having a meeting with the Kenyan is even infinetesmially above 0. Follow the money trail.</p>
<p>By its silence on the obvious fact that Native Born White Americans exist and are being severely harmed by post-1965 non-whites, numbersusa contributes to creating a hostile climate for Native Born White Americans. Native Born White Americans are a non-people as far as numbersusa.com is concerned(the same can probably be said about FAIR and CIS).</p>
<p>IF you think hispanics want a reduction in immigration,try deporting 12-20 million of the LA RAZA nation in America illegally.</p>

		<p>The thing about the proposed socialized health-care and other items on the Marxist agenda, as they try to accelerate the process of marginalizing or exterminating whites, isn&rsquo;t that the programs are &#8216;pro-black&rsquo; as some say. The programs are simply anti-white, while being good for all non-whites at the same time. Because what whites will be dealing with when they go to the govt. for health care or anything else is some black, brown or yellow govt. flunkie, a puppet for the real haters running the show. However, these puppets will have some decision making power, and they will always put their own before whites, and any non-white before whites, even though whites will be footing the majority of the bill. The collapse is going to hit, whether or not the doubters or whiners ever come around to believing it. That&rsquo;s the only way whites will regain control. More and more of the aware people out there are suddenly realizing that the &#8220;worse is better&#8221; crowd is probably right. Faster is better as well. </p>

		<p>I have no problem with a Universal Healthcare Plan - if it is truly universal.  That means everyone in the country is on it including Congress and the President.  That means everyone gets exactly the same kind of coverage and everything is equal.  That means that if you have to wait in line for a procedure, everyone must wait their turn and no politician or wealthy industrialist can cut in line OR use their influence to help their cronies cut into line.  </p>
<p>If Congress can put in a Healthcare bill without exempting themselves and other federal employees from it, I&rsquo;ll be all for it.  But before they do that, they need to un-exempt themselves and federal employees from Social Security and join the program like everyone else.</p>

		<p>Here are the options for Native Born White Americans:</p>
<p>1)Assuming that amnesty will be passed at some point in time- because of the enormous political clout of a rapidly growing non-white population with a high degree of racial conciousness-the demographic decline  of Native Born White Americans accelerates rapidly. Native Born White Americans retaliate by having larger families. The US population explodes to the one billion mark in 25 years or less and contunes to grow whay beyond a billion mark. Life supporting ecosystems collapse. There is an acute scarcity of resources.Violent racial conflict with 100 percent certainty. With 100 percent certainty, human civilization collapses. A hellish existence. Many Native Born White Americans feel they would be better off dead.</p>
<p>2)To avoid being reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority, Native Born White Americans deport 20 million illegal mostly non-white illegal aliens and deprt millins of muslims,asians and hispanics who have formed a hugh voting block for increased levels LEGAL IMMIGRATION. Implementing either policy will provoke violent racial conflict between Native Born White Americans and asians,muslims,hispanics and africans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why in heavens name white men keep joining the military I don&rsquo;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;ve been wondering for some time now.  Harvard&rsquo;s  Noel Ignatiev succinctly summed up the operating philosophy of our establishment:  &#8220;The key to solving the social problems of our age is to abolish the white race.&rdquo;   Why young white men would go and fight for a system which, regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans are in office,  considers him and his culture to be a disease that must be eradicated is beyond comprehension.     It&rsquo;s like a Pole gleefully running off to join the Wehrmacht in 1943.  Same thing for white cops who work in majority non-white cities.   Eternal suckers who get not so much as the tiniest quid pro quo.   </p>
<p>Republicans support open borders to avoid being savaged as racists,  not because they support cheap labor (with the exception of nannies, maids, and groundskeepers.  They don&rsquo;t want any blacks in or around their houses, just like their rich Liberal friends).    The white-hating racism centered in the media and the universities is the enemy,  Republicans are merely collaborators who only exist in relation to that main enemy.  </p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t Baby Boomers who messed this country up, it was the so-called Greatest Generation, a name tellingly bestowed upon them by a prominent leftist.   The immigration reform act was passed in &#8216;65 when most boomers were still children.  </p>

		<p>To sandstorm (#50), and anyone else with a constructive response to offer:</p>
<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly, but where to start? </p>
<p>By coming to AmRen I at least recognize that other whites share my viewpoint, but when I step out the door every morning it seems like I&rsquo;m completely isolated. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t misunderstand&hellip;I&rsquo;m not questioning anyone else&rsquo;s level of commitment, but how do we begin coalescing? How do we move beyond internet posting? How do we recognize each other? </p>
<p>How do we set aside the ruminations about escaping to the Pacific Northwest, and instead identify each other so that a functional group of whites can begin pursuing white interests, vocally and efficiently?</p>
<p>How do we take back a homeowner&rsquo;s association, or a small municipality, before we conquer taking back the country? </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to sound dramatic, but the time has truly come. With President Obama at the helm, and his liberal, vindictive, white-hating henchmen working furiously to marginalize whites at every turn, the &#8220;momentum of battle&#8221; is now firmly on their side. </p>

<p>I completely agree with. On the one hand I am for a single payer health care system. However, a single payer health care system can only work in a racially homogeneous society. A case can be made that political liberals are actually trying to destroy an possibility of an authentic socialistic health care system.</p>
<p>There should be no doubt that  the Kenyan in the White house is attempting to race-replace Native Born White Americans with his health care program.</p>
<p>The charge of socialism is insane. The insurance companies love the Kenyan&rsquo;s health care program. A national health insurance program would look like medicare before Bush gutted it to pay for his war crimes in Iraq.</p>
<p>If it were up to the anti-socialist-Rev Ted Pike for example-there would be no more medicare for senior citizens and the physcically disdabled such as my late quadraplegic brother.</p>
<p>The Kenyan in the White House health care program is a largely privatized-insurance companies calling the shots-with a impoversihed single payer alternative.</p>
<p>We are in a very dangerous situation in America. The health care alternatives are rotten. The racial balkanization of America would make high quality medicare system unviable. The privatized health care system that some people here are so enhtusiastic has bankrupted thousands of Native Born White families. </p>
<p>There should be a three hour debate on Public Television between Harvard medical sbhool professor David Himmelstien and Senator Bill Frist moderated by Charlie Rose. I very certain about who would win this debate. </p>

		<p>I find the comments that racially conscious whites gathering together and regrouping to a certain region of the U.S. would be anything remotely resembling &#8216;cowardice&rsquo; or &#8216;stupidity.&rsquo;  Haven&rsquo;t any of you ever heard the term strategic retreat?</p>
<p>A well numbered group of us (let&rsquo;s say at least 9,999 of whom are at reproductive age, not including myself) that understand the value of very high white reproductive rates could split off and do our own thing, and it would simply be a matter of time until we regained the country.  When we&rsquo;re comparing the long term planning skills of whites, blacks and hispanics I think everyone here has no doubts who would come out on top.</p>
<p>To those who scoff and say it isn&rsquo;t feasible (utter nonsense) or those who say we should act now - what&rsquo;s the point in trying for an armed revolution when you&rsquo;re vastly outnumbered, outgunned and infiltrated by countless traitors?  It&rsquo;d be a losing battle from the get go.</p>
<p>If we want a viable America for our children and our children&rsquo;s children, then we can only rely on ourselves to create it.  For if we don&rsquo;t - then who will.  Of course this might just be a pointless rant by a frustrated twenty-one year old white anglo-saxon germanic protestant male who sees his country falling apart around him, but hey - we&rsquo;re allowed to rant every now and then when facing seemingly impossible odds with at times depressingly pessimistic allies, aren&rsquo;t we?</p>

<p>Denver Democratic party headquarters was &#8220;vandalized&#8221; by an evil conservative racist White Republican person.  Posters advertizing Obama&rsquo;s health care were torn down and defaced and windown were broken. It was all over the news about us evil anti Obama Whites.</p>

		<p>Bud, while you quote Noel Ignatiev, who wonders why white men still join the military etc, you have to keep in mind he made these remarks after coming under fire. Coming under fire for stating the white race should be eradicated. Mr. Ignatiev made his remarks about the military to try and placate certain quarters. Mr. Ignatiev is apparently similar to Tim Wise, as both preach about white perfidy and guilt, presenting themselves as white, but allegedly not seeing themselves as white at all behind closed doors with their associates.  And it appears to be collapsing, bit by bit. The very tools used against us, the non-whites, will make this happen as more and more are imported and more and more get special treatment from Uncle Sam. </p>

		<p>There definitely HAS been a change in our country, and it isn&rsquo;t just racial.  What has happened is that the liberal whites have embraced the values of the lower classes, and in so doing, have brought our country&rsquo;s values down to the level of the entitlement and victim consciousnesses.  What that has done is to reject the time-honored American values that state that every individual is responsible for his/her every thought, word, and act, AND that if you want things to be better, you work hard to better yourself first and the larger society as a byproduct of your own improvement.  Today, the lower class values demand that improvements be legislated, not worked for, and that the values themselves be legislated (hence all the cries of &#8220;racism&#8221;, when the individuals involved should have been making positive choices for themselves, such as staying in school, getting post high school training/education, not bringing children into the world when a teenager, and staying away from drugs and excesses of alcohol.)  In short, true American values demand that the individual take responsibility for his/her own life; the lower class values demand that others be blamed for their position in life and that legislation produce for them the results of the hard work of others.  It&rsquo;s pathetic.  And while it seems on the surface to be a racial situation, it actually goes much deeper than that.  It is a VALUES conflict, and I believe Americans will fight a whole lot harder for the values they hold dear than for any merely racial conflict.  </p>

		<p>Those who think that Whites can make a strategic retreat to the northwest need to look at who owns the land in that area.</p>
<p>Most of the land in the northwest, northern midwest and mountain states belongs to the federal government and is merely leased to ranchers and state governments.</p>
<p>The feds will kill any Whites who attempt to set up a White homeland on federal land.</p>
<p>The real problem with a federal medical system is that like every other benefit, care will be denied to Whites.  At present, disability, welfare, food stamps, SBA loans, government contracts, other help for businesses, mortgages, and even victims of crimes compensation are routinely denied whites while freely given to non whites including illegal aliens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what will happed with federal health care.</p>
<p>At present the only benefit programs whites have equal access to are unemployment benefits and social security.  That&rsquo;s because those programs are basically bank accounts.  Put so much in, get so much out.</p>
<p>But virtually everything else is dependent on affirmative action white hating government workers who are under orders to deny to whites the benefits our taxes pay for.</p>
<p>I think whites realize this and that is why whites are fighting against federal health care.  It&rsquo;s ok to be denied a SBA loan, a job or food stamps because you are white.  It&rsquo;s another thing when you are denied health care and die because you are white.</p>
<p>This federal health care is just another step in the slow genocide of whites planned by our own government.  </p>
<p>First takeover of the cities by black criminals.  Then a wave of black on white crime.  Then school busing.  Then affirmative action.  More and more government and judicially encouraged and abetted black on white crime.  More and more jobs denied to whites because we are whites.  Anti white propaganda taught in schools from kindergarten to PHD level.</p>
<p>Whites can take care of their own health in many ways by eating right, not smoking or drinking, excercising etc.  But what happens when you are in an auto accident or fall, break your back and need medical care?</p>
<p>It will be denied because you are White. </p>

I have no problem with a Universal Healthcare Plan - if it is truly universal.&#8221;</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be universal.  It will be like every other government program, from food stamps to government jobs, off limits to Whites.<br>
