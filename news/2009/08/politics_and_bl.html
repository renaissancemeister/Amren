<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1940, when blacks were politically impotent, their poverty rate was 87 percent. By 1960, before blacks achieved much political power, it fell to 47 percent. During that interval, in various skilled trades, the incomes of blacks relative to whites more than doubled. Before 1960, there were no anti-poverty programs or affirmative action programs that can explain an economic advance that exceeded any other 20-year interval, though there were Truman and Eisenhower administration attacks on some of the gross forms of racial discrimination. A significant chunk of black progress occurred simply through migration from rural areas in the South to big Northern cities. Between 1960 and 1980, black poverty fell roughly 17 percent and continued falling to today&rsquo;s 24 percent. The decline in black poverty between 1960 and 1980 might have simply been a continuation of a trend starting much earlier and cannot be attributed solely to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, President Johnson&rsquo;s War on Poverty, or Richard Nixon&rsquo;s affirmative action.</p>
<p>Most of the major problems that many black people face are not amendable to political solutions and government anti-poverty programs. Let&rsquo;s look at some. In 1940, 86 percent of black children were born inside marriage, and the illegitimacy rate among blacks was about 15 percent. Today, only 35 percent of black children are born inside marriage, and the illegitimacy rate hovers around 70 percent. Today&rsquo;s breakdown of the black family is unprecedented. It began in the 1960s with the War on Poverty and the harebrained ideas of the welfare state. In the mid-1960s, Daniel Moynihan sounded the alarm about the breakdown in the black family in his book &#8220;The Negro Family: The Case for National Action.&#8221; At that time black illegitimacy was 26 percent. Moynihan said, &#8220;(A)t the heart of the deterioration of the fabric of the Negro society is the deterioration of the Negro family.&#8221; He added, &#8220;The steady expansion of welfare programs can be taken as a measure of the steady disintegration of the Negro family structure over the past generation in the United States.&#8221; Moynihan&rsquo;s observations were greeted with charges of racism and blaming the victim. By the way, the welfare state is an equal opportunity family destroyer. Today&rsquo;s illegitimacy rate among whites, at nearly 30 percent, is higher than it was among blacks in the 1960s when Moynihan sounded the alarm. In Sweden, the mother of the welfare state, illegitimacy is 54 percent.</p>
<p>Blacks hold high offices and dominate the political arena in Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., New Orleans and other cities. Yet these are the very cities with the nation&rsquo;s most rotten schools, highest crime rates, high illegitimacy rates, weak family structure and other forms of social pathology. I am not saying that blacks having political power is the cause of these problems. What I am saying is that the solution to most of the major problems that confront many black people won&rsquo;t be found in the political arena and by electing more blacks to high office. In fact, politicians tend to be hostile to some of the solutions to problems many blacks face such as school choice as a means to strengthen education, the elimination of oppressive licensing restrictions for various occupations, and supportive of job-destroying labor legislation such as minimum wage laws.</p>

		<p>We need to be giving more heed to people like Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell.  Williams has written elsewhere, that regardless of what one might feel about &#8220;racial justice,&#8221; there&rsquo;s not much whites can do to solve black&rsquo;s most important problems   &mdash;   fatherlessness, low education priority and crime.</p>
<p>My new motto is &#8220;I can&rsquo;t give you justice when you make your own prison.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Let coloureds ponder the following questions instead of whining and bleating about their imagined victimhood state as usual.</p>
<p>Does having white officials in power benefit white people 100%?</p>
<p>What race was it that outlawed slavery, introduced and legislated for AA, quotas and all-round preferential treatment for coloureds?</p>
<p>Did this race know that by its more recent traitorous actions, it would be disenfranchising AND dispossessing its own race?</p>
<p>Well!</p>

<p>In this case, all that means is that the parents didn&rsquo;t bother to get married.  It doesn&rsquo;t mean that the fathers deserted their families and got into drugs, crime and fathering many other illegitimate children.</p>

		<p>good stuff. i&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of politically incorrect  writings on race recently, a lot of it from mainstream sources. i guess the wearing away of obama&rsquo;s veneer of &#8220;post racialism&#8221; is finally starting to make even some PC commentators think twice about the messiah.</p>

<p>Okay, then I&rsquo;ll say it.</p>
<p>Black pathologies have grown exponentially since the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; era. Blacks can&rsquo;t seem to handle freedom and personal power. Given their rights and freedom, they destroy themselves, everything they touch, everywhere they are.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t difficult to speak the truth.<br/>

<p>Indeed. It would be much more telling to compare abandonment rates rather than marriage rates.</p>
<p>This is a decent article though. There will always be a genetic component that prevents the races from being equal, but the difference does not have to be such a gaping chasm as it is now. Race matters, but culture matters too. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think any discussion of cultural problems will become widely acceptable  &mdash;  until the future, when egalitarians are desperately looking to divert the public debate away from new discoveries in genetic science. Mark my words, liberals will start sounding like 1990&rsquo;s conservatives once science announces that they have found the &#8220;geek gene&#8221; or the &#8220;sociopath gene&#8221;. </p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s absolutely correct. Most illegitimate children in Sweden are only technically illegitimate. The father lives in the home with the mother and children, and helps support them, but the parents do not get legally married, because there are greater social welfare benefits available to unmarried mothers. </p>

		<p>There was a book published in England called &#8216;the cause and cure of criminality&rsquo;. It also noted that the poverty rate was around 80% for all Americans in 1940. All during the time the poverty was dropping, to a low of around 10% in the late 70s, crime drastically increased. </p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Correct.<br/>
In the swedish welfare state, marriage has become more or less obsolete. There is no tax benefits to marriage in Sweden, nor any other thing, you can still &#8220;divorce&#8221; your partner, if you have lived together and have had a shared economy for a certain time (5 years I believe), without being married.<br/>
Marriage has simply become a ceremony, one that has less and less importance in what is probably the most secularized nation in the world.</p>
<p>My uncle for example, is not married to the woman he lives with, and who is the mother of his children. They have lived together for 15+ years, have two kids, own a house, car and so on together, but they are not married.<br/>
They are discussing marriage, sometime, in the future, when they have the time and the money for a big church wedding, but it just keeps being pushed into the future.</p>
<p>There is simply no reason to get married in Sweden.<br/>
But that is not really the same thing as illegitimacy for the children. They still grow up in a home with both their biological parents, for them, it makes no difference if their mother has a diamond or not on her ring (dunno how it is in USA, but traditionally in Sweden, engaged couples give each other simple golden rings, with the bride getting a fancier diamond ring at the wedding).</p>

		<p>The government can influence behavior through policies. But there are very few problems that can be &#8220;solved&#8221; through more government. The cure to most problems is personal responsibility. And this goes for all problems and all peoples.</p>
