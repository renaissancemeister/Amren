<h1>How African American Is the Net Black Advantage? Differences in College Attendance Among Immigrant Blacks, Native Blacks, and Whites</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pamela R. Bennett and Amy Lutz, Sociology of Education, Volume 82, Number 1, January 2009, pp. 70-99(30)</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that although a smaller proportion of black high school graduates than white high school graduates attend college, black high school graduates are more likely than white high school graduates to attend college net of differences in socioeconomic family background and academic performance. Yet, the overrepresentation of black immigrants in selective colleges and theoretical work on immigrant incorporation raises the question of whether this net black advantage is very African American. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, logistic regression, and propensity score analysis, the authors investigated whether the net black advantage reflects the educational trajectories of immigrant rather than native blacks. They found dual, yet distinct, cases of the net black advantage, such that native blacks are more likely than are comparable whites to attend all types of colleges, whereas immigrant blacks are only more likely than similar whites to attend selective colleges. The theoretical and social stratification implications of the findings are explored.</p>

		<p>I wonder if they have EVER considered performing a study that&rsquo;s not completely useless and worthless?</p>
<p>Such a waste of time.  Hopefully, the universities will have to drop this kind of nonsense, because of a lack of funds.  And, hopefully, the useless departments that are nothing but nonsense will go by the board as well, like black studies, and feminist nonsense.</p>

		<p>Sounds like they&rsquo;ve found a way to get rid of affirmative action. Turns out it harms blacks. </p>

 As hard as it is to wade through all the academic jargon,<br>
this article is still significant. It points up that the<br>
original rationale for racial preferences - as compensation<br>
for slavery - was a complete bait-and-switch. The<br>
beneficiaries of preferences often have no such claim.</p>
<p> The Roberts Supreme Court has what may be a brief window<br>
of opportunity to overturn this insanity.</p>

		<p>It seems that the &#8220;prestigious&#8221; schools are willing to admit a generally more civilized &#8220;immigrant&#8221; black (wonder where they are coming from?) over their less civilized American brothers. This speaks volumes about both the hypocrisy and the weaseling of the schools, along with the lack of adaptation to civilized norms by American blacks.  </p>

		<p>You only need to know one thing: the vast majority of blacks who go to 4 year colleges don&rsquo;t graduate, with the exception of elite Ivies like Brown and Harvard, or top liberal arts schools like Amherst. The latter of course take only the cream, and the blacks there are a tiny percent of the majority who go and flunk out of state schools and the wretched historic black colleges, otherwise known as High school U.</p>

		<p>Since &ldquo;attorney general&rdquo; eric holder has abdicated his &ldquo;oath of office&rdquo; and has openly declared that &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; are for (certain) minorities ONLY, I have taken back my constitutional rights and urge all like-minded whites, asians and other non-protected races to do the same. AN of post #1 is absolutely correct about blacks. In my business, their patronage is NOT welcome. I would rather do with the small loss of potential income than deal with them. &ldquo;Public accommodation&rdquo; laws can be gotten around without too much trouble. Housing laws can be gotten around by developing networks outside the traditional &ldquo;real estate&rdquo; networks.<br>
Non-protected people, the time is NOW. I would like to see businesses advertise discreetly that they serve a white or asian clientele and that blacks are not welcome. This already exists to a limited degree in some asian circles where blacks are not welcome or served; a perceived &ldquo;language barrier&rdquo; can be used to discourage black patronage.<br>

		<p>Also, places for white students are being squeezed relentlessly through racial discrimination practices in the name of politically motivated &#8216;equality and diversity&rsquo; diktat.</p>
<p>No wonder, therefore, there are more blacks and other non-whites blocking study places in the education system than whites, who are still the majority population, should be occupying. </p>
