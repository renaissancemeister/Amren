<h1>Whites a California Minority, but a Voting Majority</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martin Wisckol, OC Register, August 4, 2009, </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White non-Hispanics in California have lost their majority status over the past 30 years (now 43 percent of all residents) but continue to account for the majority of voters (65 percent), according to a report just out from The Field Poll.</p>
<p>Latinos now account for 37 percent of the population but just 21 percent of registered voters here. Asians comprise 14 percent of the population and 8 percent of voters. Blacks are 6 percent of both the population and the voter rolls.</p>
<p>These traditional minorities are a big reason that Democrats dominate the state. White non-Hispanics make up 79 percent of Republicans, but just 55 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of non-partisans.</p>
<p>And while you might not know it from the people they put in office, the California electorate is now older, better educated and includes more homeowners and a smaller proportion of Protestants than 30 years ago.</p>
<p>* 68 percent of voters are 40 or older (58 percent in 1978).</p>
<p>* 46 percent are college graduates (36 percent in 1978).</p>
<p>* 74 percent are homeowners (66 percent in 1978).</p>
<p>* 38 percent are Protestants (50 percent in 1978).</p>

<p>In other words, despite their majority in the electorate, whites in California have finally hit the demographic tipping point. Nothing short of an outright constraint on both nonwhite voting &ldquo;rights&rdquo; and also their allowed candidacy to elective office, will halt the gradual destruction of that state&rsquo;s sociopolitical and economic foundations.  </p>
<p>This is what is called, Diversity in Zenith; end of story!</p>

		<p>It looks as though Democratic voters decreased much faster than Republican ones looking at the chart while the nonpartisan vote tripled over the last 35 years.  The next wave of amnesty legislation should wipe out the White voting majority in the state not that it makes any difference.  It&rsquo;s comprised largely of self hating liberals, homosexuals and radical feminists.  </p>

<p>Huh?  Wow.  So non-hispanic whites are a minority in demographics but a majority in voting power yet they continue to vote in suicidal politicians with suicidal policies?  But, I thought non-hispanic whites were the ones with the higher IQ&rsquo;s?  Obviously, the evidence says otherwise.<br>

		<p>Yes, and every time the Whites in California voted to stem the flow of illegals [cutting off benefits etc.], they&rsquo;ve had their votes tossed out by some liberal WHITE judge. </p>

		<p>Given the profile of voters, California ought to be doing better. How can anyone outside of Berkeley, San Francisco or West LA who is white, vote Democratic or vote for the Boxer/Pelosi types that ruined the state?</p>

		<p>I have a friend who is under the illusion that if we deport all the illegals that America will return to some kind of pre 1960s golden era.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  First of all you have all these hyphenated aliens and their descendants that call themselves &#8220;Americans&#8221;, courtesy of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act.  Second, you have a rapidly growing dysfunctional black population projected to almost double in the next 50 years.  Third, and probably most important, you have a degraded White gene pool with many people having as little as 1/32 nonwhite DNA.  Yes, it does make a difference. Perhaps someone could help me out here but I&rsquo;m not aware of any nation in the history of the world that has declined as dramatically as we have over the past 40 years and then suddenly rejeuvenated itself.  I&rsquo;ve come to grips with the fact that America is terminally ill.   </p>

		<p>Sounds like White-Minority Rule.  This will eventually be used to limit the voting rights of white people.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m surprised the hate-america crowd haven&rsquo;t glommed on to this tactic yet.  </p>

<p>I totally agree with you.  We claim to have the highest IQ&rsquo;s compared to Non-Whites and yet we are voting ourselves out of power and giving our country away.  I guess we are not as intelligent as we think we are, we do this to ourselves and then flee.  That&rsquo;s happening in all the South Western and Western States.  There are a handful of us that are very intelligent, but let&rsquo;s face it, Whites are not the superior race!</p>

		<p>When talking about California, it&rsquo;s always about white-flight? Where aren&rsquo;t whites fleeing? And, sure, there will always be happy Doctor type, professional class, whites moving to California. No one ever discusses breeding patterns when discussing whites whites as a minority in California</p>

		<p>Watch what happens to the California State pension funds when the non-Whites get the upper hand.  Governor Villagarosa will &#8220;borrow&#8221; half of it to spend on welfare and jobs for Mexicans, and the other half will be put into &#8220;socially responsible investments&#8221;.  A lot of retired liberal teachers and social workers will be living in trailer parks.   </p>

		<p>I think we all know how California&rsquo;s exploding non-white population will vote - increased government handouts and subsidies across the board, and at a time when taxpayers are fleeing and the state is already insolvent.  California is a train wreck waiting to happen.  This isn&rsquo;t some kooky conspiracy theory.</p>

		<p>When the acorn (oops, I mean &#8220;census&#8221; worker) comes to the door, ask for identification.  You will need it for the police report that you will file after your house is broken into.  Some of the questions such as &#8220;what time do you leave for work?&#8221; and &#8220;how many hours do you work per day?&#8221; can (and will) be used by acorn census workers to &#8220;case&#8221; your residence and will be seen as an opportunity to take whatever they want to fulfill their sense of &#8220;social justice&#8221;.  I plan on asking for ID, writing everything down, and then telling them to leave (without answering any questions) since I cannot verify their identity.<br>
Another way to &#8220;make things right&#8221; is to &#8220;skew&#8221; the census (if you choose to &#8220;cooperate&#8221; and answer questions).  The only question that is legally required to be answered is the one  concerning &#8220;how many people live at this residence?&#8221;  Be creative.  You should have at least SIX people living with you.<br>
acorn skewed the election with graveyard voters and multiple fraudulent voter registrations.  Let&rsquo;s &#8220;adjust&#8221; the census.</p>
