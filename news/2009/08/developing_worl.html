<h1><a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB125090339313750961.html">Developing World&rsquo;s Parasites, Disease Hit U.S.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephanie Simon and Betsy McKay, Wall Street Journal, August 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Parasitic infections and other diseases usually associated with the developing world are cropping up with alarming frequency among U.S. poor, especially in states along the U.S.-Mexico border, the rural South and in Appalachia, according to researchers.</p>
<p>Government and private researchers are just beginning to assess the toll of the infections, which are a significant cause of heart disease, seizures and congenital birth defects among black and Hispanic populations.</p>
<p>One obstacle is that the diseases, long thought to be an overseas problem, are only briefly discussed in most U.S. medical school classes and textbooks, so many physicians don&rsquo;t recognize them.</p>
<p>Some of the infections are transmitted by bug bites and some by animal feces contaminated with parasite larvae; still others are viral. All spread in conditions of overcrowding, malnutrition, poor sanitation and close contact with animals receiving little veterinary care.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are diseases that we know are ten-fold more important than swine flu,&#8221; said Peter Hotez, a microbiologist at George Washington University and leading researcher in this field. &#8220;They&rsquo;re on no one&rsquo;s radar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The insect-borne diseases  &mdash;  among them, Chagas and dengue fever  &mdash;  thrive in shanty towns along the Mexican border, where many homes have no window screens and where poor drainage allows standing puddles for bugs to breed. Outbreaks of a bacterial infection transmitted in rat urine have cropped up among the urban poor in Baltimore and Detroit.</p>
<p>Such parasites as toxocara  &mdash;  shed in animal feces  &mdash;  thrive in the soil and sandpits where poor children often play. There are an estimated 10,000 toxocara infections a year in the U.S. Symptoms include wheezing, fever and retinal scarring severe enough to blind.</p>
<p>These diseases share a common thread. &#8220;People who live in the suburbs are at very low risk,&#8221; Dr. Hotez said. But for the 37 million people in the U.S. who live below the poverty line, he said, &#8220;There is real suffering.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chagas disease, another troubling infection, begins with the innocent-sounding &#8220;kissing bug,&#8221; an insect endemic in parts of Latin America and also found in across the American South, especially Texas.</p>
<p>The bugs are often infected with a tiny protozoan parasite, which they excrete after snacking on human or animal blood. When a bite victim scratches, he may accidentally rub the parasite into his open wound  &mdash;  and an infection takes hold. Chagas spreads more easily in poor rural communities where homes without window screens get infested.</p>
<p>Many of those ill with Chagas are immigrants or travelers who became infected elsewhere; as many as half develop complications such as cardiac inflammation that can cause heart failure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationally, one in 30,000 potential blood donors tests positive  &mdash;  yet many don&rsquo;t seek treatment even after they are told they have Chagas, said Susan Stramer, executive scientific officer of the American Red Cross. Many are immigrants who don&rsquo;t want to draw attention: &#8220;They&rsquo;re afraid of the consequences of finding out they&rsquo;re infected in the U.S,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Public-health experts say the first step in fighting the infections is to learn more about them. &#8220;We understand the basic biology,&#8221; said Mark Eberhard, who directs the parasitic-diseases division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &#8220;But we don&rsquo;t understand that much about the burden of these diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hoping to raise awareness  &mdash;  and money for research  &mdash;  the CDC is teaming with private foundations to organize a national summit this fall for doctors, nurses, community activists and politicians.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re becoming a third world country, why wouldn&rsquo;t we get third world parasites and diseases?</p>
<p>The degenerative processes are working towards complete destruction of this nation.  It won&rsquo;t be too much longer now.</p>

		<p>I lived in Toronto in 2003 during the great SARS scare. A Chinese immigrant brought the disease to Toronto, where it then infected and killed several white &amp; Asian persons. People were freaked out, nobody wanted to come to Toronto, and the local economy totally tanked until the public panic subsided. And it all had to do with a disease that would probably never have arisen in North America. Granted, the woman who brought it over isn&rsquo;t personally to blame, as I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d rather not have been infected. But those deaths that followed, plus Toronto&rsquo;s collapsing economy, are harbingers of what medical &amp; financial pain we&rsquo;ll feel from massive third world immigration to North America.</p>

		<p>  Part of the legacy of our open borders policy is the rapid spread of pandemics. It took no time for the Mexican flu to travel to El Norte. The authorities were really sweating it that it might be a fatal strain. However, they lucked out as the disease was no more virulent than other strains.  They could stopping worrying that there might be widespread protests against our insane immigration policy.</p>

		<p>I live in Texas and I can tell you that I see disgusting behavior exhibited by illegal aliens on a daily basis. Many of them have almost no concept of hygiene. They will stand near you in a public place and cough without covering their mouths and allow their kids to do the same thing. They will descend into a grocery store en masse and huge families of Mexicans will allow their dirty, nude kids to prowl the entire store. And if you are ever in Texas for a visit and must use a laundromat, never under any circumstances use the folding tables as Mexicans use them to change diapers (which they usually toss onto the floor or into the street.) Given this kind of element is allowed to roam freely in our society, I am just amazed that we aren&rsquo;t all plague victims by now.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re rapidly approaching the year 2010. I was born in 1975. When I was a kid, we looked toward the 2000&rsquo;s as a time when we would be living on the moon, exploring Mars, using robots for housework, etc. Who would have thought that we would actually be going backwards, that American and the world would regress into a Third-World planet?</p>
<p> It is utterly insane that the United States and Europe, the countries that sent men into space, built airplanes and computers and developed the greatest government systems in the history of the world could be brought down by peasants, and not through armed revolution, but through excessive breeding, guilt, and fear of being called racist.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a fatal strain this time around, but what about next time? Several Latin American countries, not imbued by fears of racism and political correctness, simply halted all planes from Mexico. Guess what, these countries had NO swine flu or very little.</p>
