			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), August 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Leading professionals are becoming less intelligent, researchers said yesterday. Lawyers, doctors, accountants and bankers were all cleverer a generation ago, a study found.</p>
<p>The startling conclusion was reached by academics looking into social mobility. They wanted to find out why those born into poor families in the 1970s were much less successful than those born in the 1950s.</p>
<p>The research found that as poor children in the 1970s lost the chance of a good education  &mdash;  often blamed on the abolition of grammar schools  &mdash;  they were not able to reach the top professions.</p>
<p>Instead, the places were filled by those from wealthier families  &mdash;  who were not always as naturally gifted.</p>
<p>The researchers from Bristol University based their findings on IQ tests taken by ten and 11-year-olds as part of two major surveys into the lives of children born in 1958 and 1970.</p>
<p>They found a decline in IQ among those in the best-rewarded and highest-status professions between the two generations. It means professionals now in their 50s are likely to be brighter than those in their late 30s.</p>
<p>Ratings from the tests give someone of exactly average intelligence a score of 100, with broadly average intelligence running from 90 to 109. Between 110 and 140 is regarded as superior intelligence.</p>
<p>It found that lawyers born in 1958 had IQs about 10.5 per cent above the average when tested as children  &mdash;  in the superior bracket. But those born in 1970 had IQs nearer to 7.5 per cent above the norm, putting them into the average bracket.</p>
<p>Similarly, accountants from 1958 were nearly 10 per cent above average, but only 6 per cent above average in 1970.</p>
<p>Bankers&rsquo; IQs fell from 7.5 per cent above average to 6.5 per cent, while university lecturers dropped from 9 to 7.5 per cent above average. Doctors were 12.5 per cent above average in 1958, but 11 per cent above average in 1970.</p>
<p>A handful of professions showed that the 1970 generation were at the same level or more intelligent than their older colleagues.</p>
<p>These tended to be those of lesser status, with less clearly laid out career paths, or with more egalitarian traditions. They included nursing, science, engineering, art and journalism.</p>
<p>However, the researchers  &mdash;  led by Lindsey Macmillan from the Centre for Market and Public Organisation at Bristol University  &mdash;  offered a crumb of comfort to those who worry about whether their GP is up to the job.</p>
<p>&#8216;Somewhat reassuringly,&rsquo; the study said, &#8216;doctors and scientists and other medical professionals exhibit the highest IQ test scores over time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Labour has consistently blamed the fall in social mobility on universities shutting out youngsters from less wealthy backgrounds.</p>
<p>But critics say the problem lies with comprehensive schools that fail to help poor pupils develop and achieve good grades.</p>
<p>They point out that the major difference between the two generations born in 1958 and 1970 is that the former were educated in the era of grammar schools.<br>

<p>The major difference between 1958 and 1970 is the pill. Smarter families consider it fashionable to have 1.2 children and mock families who have more. It&rsquo;s called dysgenics.</p>

		<p>Actually, I think the AR lead-in about affirmative action is off-base this time. If anything, I&rsquo;m reading almost the reverse: that since the intelligent-but-poor cannot get an education commensurate with their potential any more [closing of the &#8216;grammar schools&rsquo;], only those who have the up-front money can break into the professions, and they are the ones who are not as bright.  I am definitely, and defiantly, an Anglophile, so I will leave it to others to stoop to remarks about upper-class half-wit English twits.</p>
<p>Oh  yes, and I don&rsquo;t really read any racial aspect into this story at all.</p>

		<p>It would be more informative had they carried out the politically forbidden step of breaking down the IQs of the various professions and the two generations by race.  That would let us know how much of the decline is due to the racial metamorphosis of Great Britain.  As it is, we can only speculate.</p>

		<p>There are a finite number of spots in college or work for those who come from humble backgrounds (not socially connected).  Call these spots &#8220;walk-on&#8221; positions.  In addition to the walk-on positions, there are &#8220;legacy&#8221; positions.  These are spots at companies and elite schools that are given to the children of the wealthy and/or well-connected.  Getting such a slot has less to do with merit and more to do with birth, and the talent pool from which these candidates are drawn is clearly smaller than the population at large.  The merit-based competition for these spots is less rigorous, due to the smaller field of competitors (e.g. GWB). </p>
<p>Because of affirmative action, many (if not most) of the &ldquo;walk-on&rdquo; positions are given to protected minorities who are more intelligent than the average of their ethnic cohort, but in most cases, less intelligent than a White person of similar standing relative to his cohort.  Again, since we&rsquo;re talking about a competitive field that is far smaller than the general population (limited to minority cohort), the &ldquo;set-aside&rdquo; walk-on positions for minorities are filled who are less intelligent than those who would be selected from a purely merit-based process.  </p>
<p>This leaves a small number of positions that are awarded wholly on merit and open to the population at large, which includes non-affluent or socially unconnected Whites.  What this means is that if you find a White guy who comes from a poor background and has earned his position on merit, he&rsquo;s probably brilliant.  Additionally, the unconnected Whites who are of above-average intelligence but &ldquo;shut out&rdquo; of the walk-on opportunities will either be underemployed and much smarter than they need to be relative to their jobs or have simply gone into business for themselves.  Remember this when you go to a &ldquo;diversity job fair&rdquo; (aren&rsquo;t they all!).<br>

		<p>I recall living in the UK as Britain was about to change its schooling.  The Labourite  government had adverts on the telly extolling the wonders of the new comprehensive schools.  I watched and thought, &#8220;My God, they want to import the American high school!&#8221;  Too bad that Thatcher did not restore the traditional British system that allowed poor, intelligent students to rise.  But in the 70s the American EEOC let its war against testing in particular and intelligence in general.  That way quotas could be filled.  More important, children of well-to-do Blacks could gain admittance to universities and scholarships, etc., above poor whites who scored higher on the exams and who were probably more intelligent and who might have contributed much more to society.  &mdash;    &mdash;  Hugh Murray </p>

		<p>And the author made no connection whatsoever to Affirmative Action and the overall dumbing down of our education system thanks to the huge influx of minorities the past few decades?</p>
<p>Universities are put on a pedestal to go out of their way to accept blacks and Hispanics, their test scores notwithstanding. They commonly jump over much better qualified white students in order to meet their racial quota. </p>
<p>The same can be said for employers, who are basically forced to hire a certain number of minorities to avoid &#8220;civil rights&#8221; lawsuits. These coddled non-whites typically have much lower IQ scores than qualified whites. </p>
<p>By then, the snowball effect is inevitable and your field of professionals has been successfully dumbed down. </p>

		<p>This stinks of Affirmative Action.  A predictable result of placing diversity over excellence.  Standards are lowered so that blacks and other minorities are represented in sufficient enough numbers to perpetuate the myth that somehow we are all &#8216;equal&rsquo;.  Of course every piece of God forsaken evidence speaks to the contrary, but we, as a society, ignore that.</p>
<p>I seem to remember the government threatening the state of New York.  About 15 years ago a watch group discovered that there were not enough blacks who were able to pass the state&rsquo;s Bar Exam.  The consequence would have been limited federal funding if the state did not rectify the situation.  The state responded by lowering the requirements to pass the exam.</p>
<p>The result?  Yes, perhaps some of the Whites in the legal profession are just as smart as those from yesteryear, but the overall &#8216;average&rsquo; IQ of lawyers is lower due to all those folks who are now lawyers that shouldn&rsquo;t be.  This is 100% applicable to other professions that were forced to become more diverse.</p>
<p>As one of those professionals mentioned above, I had to earn my credentials through hard work and proven performance. I cannot help but resent the very idea that we realize &#8216;enrichment&rsquo; through diversity.  An example is the story above, the dumbing down of a profession.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and there are lawyers and judges out there that cannot speak or write in complete sentences.  However, it seems to be poetic justice that the legal profession is experiencing a declining average IQ.  After all, they are the ones most responsible for our current demise.</p>

		<p>Interesting that they didn&rsquo;t think about the effect the introduction of contraceptives in the early 1950&rsquo;s would have had on the 1970&rsquo;s group. When the people in the highest IQ group only have one child the number of available people 20 years later goes decreases dramatically and the medical schools are forced to take on less able people who would normally be excluded by only taking the top 10%.</p>

		<p>Although Britain began importing colored people into the country in the 1950s, their numbers did not climb in significance until the 1990s.  Affirmative action is not the cause of the problem here, at least for the 70s generation but some other factor.  The same can&rsquo;t be said about the US though as their is a direct correlation between desegregation and the decline of public schools.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all &#8220;free&#8221; in Europe.  The money just drops out of the sky.  And, I&rsquo;m sure, they admit just anyone into their top colleges and universities.   Maybe we should tell blacks and Hispanics about that and they might want to move there, en mass.  :P</p>

<p>&gt; That is because there are fewer Jewish immigrants than earlier and Jewish doctors are more welcomed in Europe now and all over the world.  Open up your history book on European history.  Note that in the middle ages, the only medical school (university) in Europe was in Montepeller and was staffed mostly by Jewish physicians.  Jews were Hellenized in the second century BCE and have followed the path of Hippocrates ever since and continually supplied the Western world with its top physicians, despite being so often paid back with persecution.  Jewish physicians carried on the tradition of the Hippocratic Oath like their religion, through unimaginable ages of personal and group demonization, and taugh certain elite whites in Europe and so assisted in this vital way in the rise of Europe (as well as other important roles).  </p>
<p>Being an MD as just as profitable as ever.  It just costs more all around to practice, hence the rising cost of health care.  But I would say that burn-out is now more common among MDs, where previously it used to apply to more exclusively to nurses and other specialties, such as osteopathy, psychiatry, physical therapy and chiropractic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I miss the old America. I miss the America when most of us were the same beautiful shade of pale, we had safe streets, and our highly-quality doctors made house calls.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&gt; My grandfather made housecalls on horseback.  In those days, people died all the time - and young from infectous diseases and relatively simple maladies.</p>
<p>I agree about house-calls however. They seem to be coming back to some regions.  It is interesting that these are ones where everyone tends to be the same race - white and rural.</p>
<p>PS &#8220;highly-quality doctors&#8221; is a gramarical faux pas that one so intelligent and informed as you ought to be able to avoid.<br>

		<p>The facts of this story are correct, namely that the professions today are not nearly a smart as they used to be, and a whole lot dumber than they think they are. And there is plenty of room for criticism on all sides.I can speak only from the standpoint of medicine, and I will confine my remarks to that profession. Education, or the lack of it, is obviously the main cause. It begins in the grammar schools, where teachers are much more concerned with how students feel about themselves than about learning, reasoning, and passing tests. The general dumbing down of the entire country&rsquo;s education system can be traced directly back to school integration and affirmative action. Medical school, intership, and residency are difficult and exhausting, and many students and young physicians are simply unwilling to put themselves through the rigors of training for the relatively meager rewards that await them, and the even fewer rewards after the passage of health care reform. In my surgical specialty, I completed 10 years of study and residency after graduating from college. There are not too many graduates today willing to subject themselves to that kind of grueling training, expecially when they can be equally well rewarded in a much shorter time by choosing specialties such as radiology and pathology, which are largely free of the headaches of nights on call.It should also be noted that some young physicians today are either lazy, or unwilling to work full-out for medicare level reimbursement. They often look to ancillary support staff such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners to ease their patient load while still generating practice income.</p>
<p>Many young practitioners today are either women or minorities. While most of the women are capable, their family responsibilities often dictate specialties which can be better scheduled to allow for family time. These specialties include anesthesiology, radiology, psychiatry, dermatology. This leaves a void in the difficult surgical subspecialties such as orthopedics, neurosurgery, cardiovascular surgery which often demand all night emergency surgical proceedures. </p>
<p>Minorities are simply unable to preform at the level they need to in order to be compared with an earlier generation of smarter, cleverer physicians. Every black physician is created as a direct result of affirmative action, no matter which medical school he comes from. They are just not able to learn and recall what they need to know to be really good physicians. But I suspect that for a number of reasons we will see more and more of these poorly trained physicians loosed on the general public. </p>
<p>The changes Obama is preparing for the health care system will cause any physician who is financially able will retire or quit. He will be replaced by either a foreign medical graduate or minority. Then Obama will not need to worry about pulling the plug on Grandma because the overall level of care will surely go down and life expectancy will decrease, and Grandma will die before she reaches the plug pulling stage.</p>
