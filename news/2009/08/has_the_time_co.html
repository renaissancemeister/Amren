			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner, August 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered General John J. Pershing to lead an invasion into Mexico, against Pancho Villa&rsquo;s forces. Villa&rsquo;s bandits were making constant incursions into the United States and regularly robbing, raping, and killing Americans living in towns along the border. These criminals operated openly due to rampant corruption among Mexican political and military leaders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Units of the Mexican military regularly cross the border into this country. The well-armed units escort drug and human smugglers and even fire upon U.S. Border Patrol agents. It is estimated that Latin drug cartels spend more than $500 million annually paying off high-ranking Mexican military and police officials.</p>
<p>Congressman Tom Tancredo (R-CO) said in a 2002 interview: &#8220;There&rsquo;s no doubt Mexican military units along the border are being controlled by drug cartels, and not by Mexico City. The military units operate freely, with little or no direction, and several of them have made numerous incursions into the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>In January 2008, the Department of Homeland Security reported that since 1996, there had been 278 known incursions by the Mexican military into the United States. They are often seen providing armed escort to drug smugglers. Incredibly, the Mexican military now enters our nation at will, with no response from the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Illegal aliens account for 29 percent of our total prison population. Many more Mexican criminals still roam our streets. The 18th Street Gang, and MS-13 have already taken over the streets of Los Angeles, now they are staking-out territory across the country. One million Mexican criminals is the equivalent to 50 divisions of enemy soldiers within this country.</p>
<p>In 2002, members of Mexico´s Arellano Felix crime organization set up shop in the San Diego area, and began a kidnapping and extortion operation. Fearing reprisals, their victims failed to report the incidents to police, and went undetected for years. During that time, the gang used their profits to purchase weapons, police uniforms, badges, even police lights for their vehicles.</p>
<p>In 2007, Los Palillos were finally busted by local and federal law enforcement.</p>
<p>Police claim that the group, known as Los Palillos (the Toothpicks), murdered at least a dozen people, committed 20 kidnappings and transported huge amounts of methamphetamine to Kansas City, Mo., to help finance their organization´s ongoing war with the Tijuana Cartel in Tijuana, all of course, from San Diego County.</p>
<p>In August 2008, the FBI´s San Diego field office admitted that they were currently investigating the kidnapping of 16 U.S. residents who were held in Tijuana between October 2007 and May 2008, including many of whom were abducted in San Diego.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Houston Chronicle recently reported that the 2006 murder of Houston resident Jose Perez, 27 had been solved, and was actually carried-out by hit men working for one of the cartels.</p>
<p>{snip} His murder was in fact, a case of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The actual target of the assassination was the Houston-based head of a Mexican drug cartel cell, responsible for distributing millions of dollars worth of cocaine into the city. The two spotters working with the shooter, misidentified Perez as the crime boss.</p>
<p>As a glaring example of just how bad the cartel violence has become in the Houston area, a few months after Perez was murdered, the hit man who killed him, was also murdered only two miles from the restaurant.</p>
<p>Houston police have arrested the alleged mastermind behind the murder plot, Jaime Zamora, 38, and charged him with capital murder. In addition to his alleged activities on behalf of the cartel, Zamora worked for Houston&rsquo;s Parks and Recreation Department, and has lived in Houston for many years.</p>
<p>Houston has also been the scene of many kidnappings orchestrated by cells working for the drug cartels. One such harrowing incident took place in 2006, when used-car dealer David DeLeon was kidnapped and held for ransom.</p>
<p>DeLeon was tortured and beaten so severely (once even being thrown across the room), that his face actually became unrecognizable. Fortunately, DeLeon was successfully rescued by Houston police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, the number of kidnappings seen in the Houston area, pale in comparison to those occurring in Phoenix.</p>
<p>According to the Phoenix Police Department, there were 359 kidnappings and more than 300 home invasions during 2008. However, police estimate the actual numbers to be closer to three times as high as the reported figures. Many victims fail to report such crimes, out of fear from further retribution from the notoriously violent cartels.</p>
<p>In November 2008, Phoenix Police Lt. Lori Burgett told CBS News: &#8220;It wasn´t uncommon to have a new kidnapping case coming into our offices on a daily basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>In April 2008, the U.S. Justice Department´s National Drug Intelligence Center released a situation report, illustrating just how widespread the activities of Mexican drug cartels have become throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>The sobering assessment read: &#8220;Mexican DTO´s (Drug Trafficking Organizations) are the most pervasive organizational threat to the United States. They are active in every region of the country and dominate the illicit drug trade in every area except the Northeast. Mexican DTO´s are expanding their operations in the Northeast and have developed cooperative relationships with DTO´s in that area in order to gain a larger share of the Northeastern drug market.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Justice Department&rsquo;s National Drug Intelligence Center, more than one cartel has adopted Atlanta as their principal distribution center for the east coast.</p>
<p>During 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration seized $70 million in cash in Atlanta, which surpassed every other U.S. region. By March, over $30 million had been seized in Atlanta for 2009, as compared to $19 million in Los Angeles, and $18 million in Chicago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the FBI, there are three Mexican cartels (Federation, Gulf Coast, Juarez) are now operating in Atlanta.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2009 Justice Department report identified 231 U.S. cities in which the cartels now operate. The list stretches from Tucson, AZ (Federation, Juarez) to Buffalo, NY (Gulf Coast).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The leadership of the cartels is in Mexico, and despite the strong words coming from Mexican President Calderon, that leadership is largely protected by the very corrupt Mexican government. Just as our police officers are not able to stop the cartels, many of their police officers are not even willing to try.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where there is a Mexican, there is Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Truer words were never spoken.  And where there is Mexico, there are all the niceties of Mexican culture, including pandemic corruption, virtual merging of drug gangs and law enforcement, and kidnappings galore.</p>

		<p>Please, by now, a rational well run nation, that cared about its citizenry, would have closed off Mexico, until that nation gets its act together. Instead, I have noticed on Main Stream Media, a constant reference to how &#8220;kids&#8221; have fun partying in Mexico. </p>

		<p> The difference between then and now is the government mandated religion of political correctness. No matter how many different nations send their people to the United States to run rampant, steal us blind, kill with impunity, drink and drive and laugh at our laws and customs absolutely nothing will be done as long as we are forced by the government to adhere to this government mandated religion.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been known for several years now that the drug cartels buy influence further into the US interior every year.  Some even say the reluctance to put the national guard or a wall up by those in Washington is due in part to the reach of the drug lords into the halls of Congress.</p>
<p>The cartels&rsquo; combined profits are allegedly on a par with the revenue for the Mexican government, making them a de facto political entity that has as much purchasing power for arms and an army as an independent nation.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the only reason the gangs are not presently in overt control of the Mexican government is because they are fighting so much among themselves.  If they ever find common ground and unite, then there&rsquo;s an excellent chance they will topple the present administration.  With all the officials on their payroll, including most of the police and military, they&rsquo;ll have a ready-made administration if and when they make their moves.  </p>
<p>If they decided to unite and work in a covert fashion, they could just quietly assume control.  Would Calderon have the audacity to oppose them, knowing his family would be in jeopardy, and that many on his side were already on the cartels&rsquo; payroll?</p>
<p>The US military has stated recently that of all the nations of the earth Mexico and Pakistan are the two most likely to collapse.</p>
<p>If Mexico goes, say in two years, will the US be strong enough at that time to initiate military action against the new cartel regime?  The US military could nuke them into oblivion, of course, but a long protracted ground war is quite another thing, especially while trying to protect their interests&hellip;and their back side&hellip;. in the US against sympathetic Mexicans already here.  Fighting a war against Mexicans in Mexico and their tribal kin here in the Southwest might be an overwhelming task.</p>

		<p>What we need to do is to deploy mobile artillery along the border. I would suggest good old reliable Katyusha rockets with Honeycomb launch tubes mounted on Humvees which could be unleashed on any Mexican units that are attempting to make incursions.</p>

		<p>We have been invaded. The response is limited defense. These cartels are based in towns and cities in Mexico. The bases should be destroyed. </p>
<p>If nuclear weapons are needed, so be it. The response should be much more violent than anything the cartels could cook up. </p>
<p>If we hit Dresden and Hiroshima in WWII, we can hit Mexican centers of crime that have sent thousands of pushers and killers here. Mexico declares war/ Great. End this terror state once and for all. </p>
<p>Ignore the &#8220;UN&#8221;</p>

		<p>With the murders, kidnappings, beheadings and all sorts of horrible crime that exists in Mexico, we may as well share a border with Iran or any of the terrorists nations. Yet our govenment goes merrily along speaking of our neighbors and trading partners. Might as well invite Jack the Ripper to dinner!</p>

<p>In response: we could not invade Mexico for two reasons - 1) most of our troops are overseas (where they don&rsquo;t belong) and 2)we have a HUGE fifth column right here in the US who would not take kindly to &#8220;gringos&#8221; interfering in internal Mexican problems.  It would take all our limited resolve just to seal the border with Mexico to stop tens of millions of &#8220;refugees&#8221; from pouring into the US.  And certainly Obama would do nothing to prevent the swamping of America.  Mexico&rsquo;s collapse is our collapse.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a conspiracy theorist-type, still&hellip; It could almost seem like the Mexican government has a secret plan of some sort: actually encouraging illegal immigration to the US of some of the less desired elements of their own society, to create a new Mexico, with less criminals, less people hung up on the Mexican equivalent of welfare, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Almost like the States were used like some non-official penal colony or something!</p>
<p>But I guess a huge part of the problem is that neither the Democrats, or the Republicans, are willing to do what is necessary to adress this silent invasion, et have immigration laws be enforced efficiently. I suppose both parties want cheap labor for the big businesses run by good friends of theirs&hellip;<br>

<p>No conspiracy theories.  It&rsquo;s semi-official Mexican government policy:</p>
<p><a href="/features/mexguide/index.html" rel="nofollow">/features/mexguide/index.html</a></p>
<p>And from there it doesn&rsquo;t take a dummy to figure out why.  The (mostly) Caucasian Mexican elite wants to dump its social problems and potential revolutionaries on the United States.  This is why I support the left wing of Mexican politics, because they don&rsquo;t want Mestizos &#8220;moving&#8221; north, they want them in Mexico to bring down the plutocracy.  And I&rsquo;m not about to carry water for the Mexican plutocracy because they certainly won&rsquo;t carry my water.</p>

<p>I also think whiter and whiter Margaret</p>
<p>Exactly what the government of Italy did to solve some of the problems of Sicily 130 years ago.  After their glorious revolution throwing off the Austrian domination of Northern Italy, the Papal domination of Central Italy and the Bourbon Kings of Southern Italy and Sicily, they had to solve the problem of  the ungovernable and destitute people of Sicily.</p>
<p>So the new Italian government under King Victor Emmanuel of the houses of Pidemont and Savoy encouraged the immigration of the most violent and unskilled Sicilians to America.  The money sent home by the immigrants supported Sicily until after WW2.</p>
<p>The English government certainly encouraged the immigration of Irish Catholics to America during the 19th century potato famines.  The English government used their American colonies as a penal colony for the entire colonial period.  In fact Franklin wrote about England dumping its criminal classes on the colonies as a reason for the revolution.  From about 1650 right up to the outbreak of WW1 the city of Hamburg emptied out its jail of moderately non violent and less dangerous prisoners 9lots of pimps and prostitutes) and shipped them all off to America.</p>
<p>The dumping of undesireables on America has a long history, going back to the earliest days.  Anyone know when the first shipment of transported English criminals arrived?  Probably sometime before 1650.</p>

<p>Also to get rid of as many pure Indians as they can to lighten up the population.  Mexico has benefitted a lot from middle eastern, European and Asian immigrants.  With the fall of the Soviet Union there are a lot of eastern europeans who might move to Mexico.  Mexicans are obsessed with eye, hair and skin color and above all height. Ever watched Mexican TV?  You would think you were in Germany or Poland from the looks of the actors.  For instance, no one may enter the Miss Mexico or the state runner up contests who are less than 5ft 7.  That totally eliminates most of the Indian or metizo girls.</p>
<p>Mexico wants clever Chinese and middle eastern entrepeneurs and blueeyed, fair skinned, tall eastern europeans simply for their racial characteristics.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks Americans are evil racists who are prejudiced against Mexicans, should hear what the White Mexicans have to say about short dark people with Indian features.</p>
