			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Hargreaves, CNN, August 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In this recession-racked town, the lack of food is a serious problem. It&rsquo;s a theme that comes up again and again in conversations in Detroit. There isn&rsquo;t a single major non-discount chain supermarket in the city, forcing residents to buy food from corner stores or discount chains. Often less healthy, less varied, or more expensive food.</p>
<p>As the area&rsquo;s economy worsens  &mdash;  unemployment was over 16% in July  &mdash;  food stamp applications and pantry visits have surged.</p>
<p>Detroiters have responded to this crisis. Huge amounts of vacant land has led to a resurgence in urban farming. Volunteers at local food pantries have also increased.</p>
<p>But the food crunch is intensifying, and spreading to people not used to dealing with hunger. As middle class workers lose their jobs, the same folks that used to donate to soup kitchens and pantries have become their fastest growing set of recipients.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Across metro Detroit, social service agencies are reporting a huge spike in demand for food assistance.</p>
<p>Gleaners, an agency that distributes excess food donated from food processors, says their distribution is up 18% from last year. Michigan Department of Human Services, which handles federal food assistance like food stamps, WIC checks and such, has seen a 14% spike in applications since October. Calls to the United Way&rsquo;s help line have tripled in the last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The changing face of hunger</b></p>
<p>There have been plenty of people struggling in Detroit for a long time. What makes this recession different is the type of people coming in. It&rsquo;s no longer just the homeless, or the really poor.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s middle class folks who lost their $60,000-a-year auto job, or home owners who got caught on the wrong side of the real estate bubble.</p>
<p>Many of these people have never navigated the public assistance bureaucracy before, and that makes getting aid to them a challenge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To assist these newly hungry, Wells pointed to the United Way&rsquo;s 211 program, where people can call the hotline and speak to an operator that guides them through a wide range of available social services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Detroit responds</b></p>
<p>Actually running out of food doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a problem, so far. In fact, because more people are being affected the response seems to be greater.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Food stamp allowances were increased 14% nationwide under the stimulus plan.</p>
<p>Detroiters are also helping themselves in smaller ways. Thanks to the dearth of big supermarkets in Detroit proper  &mdash;  a phenomenon largely attributed to lack of people  &mdash;  and plenty of vacant land, community gardening has caught on big.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carmody [Dan Carmody, president of Eastern Market Corp.] is part of a group of people trying to bring healthy food to town. The efforts include setting up mobile produce stands around the city, working with convenience store owns to stock better produce, and trying to set up a program that allows food stamp recipients to spend twice as much money if they buy from a local farmer.</p>
<p>He says the food situation in Detroit is particularly depressing because the surrounding areas are chock full with some of the best eats around: Michigan grows some of the most varied crops in the nation, everything from apples and cantaloupes to peaches and watermelon. Windsor, just across the bridge, is the hydroponics capital of Canada. Artisan Amish farms are also close by in Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Getting this food to Detroit, and getting Detroiters to buy it is the challenge. That&rsquo;s where the urban farms come in.</p>

		<p>The average weight of the people in line at the food banks and food stamp offices is well over 250 lbs. counting both men AND women. Tell me again how &#8220;hungry&#8221; these people are. <br>
   The Detroit supermarkets went out of business from having to hire 4-5 rent-a-cops for each store to prevent massive shop lifting from occuring. Besides any &#8220;middle class&#8221; blacks have already left Detroit for points north and south.<br>

<p>Wrong.  It&rsquo;s attributed to black stealing, &#8220;grazing&#8221; merchandise, i.e. consuming food without paying for it at the checkout, and also not putting meat back in the meat freezer after they decide they don&rsquo;t want it, and then the meat spoils.</p>

<p>**************************</p>
<p>Excuse me, did that really say that the dearth of supermarkets in Detroit is due to the &#8220;lack of people&#8221;?   I can&rsquo;t believe I really read that right.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I wanted to mention was that community gardening is of no help.  I was involved in such a community garden, in a big city.  It was a huge amount of work, and the amount of thievery that went on was phenomenal.  Only a few white people did  all of the work, while the others (mostly blacks &amp; hispanics) did virtually nothing but come in and hang around.  Then when your tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, etc. came just to the perfect stage for harvesting, they would disappear overnight.  Somebody else was obviously watching  and they would get the produce just before you could.  They let you do all the work, and  then they did all the picking!   They would clean you out and would take much more than they could use. </p>
<p>One time, someone  [I found out who] took ALL of my lettuce, more than she could possibly use. I found out (from a neighbor) who it was and that she was selling it to her neighbors!  She was black and a junkie, needless to say.  When I objected to this, she and her whole family were highly indignant and threatened to put me in the hospital.  I narrowly escaped a severe beating. Thinking that lesson over, I decided that all this trouble just wasn&rsquo;t worth it for a few vegetables. It was cheaper just to buy your lettuce in the grocery store and not have a cracked skull and broken ribs. </p>
<p>Once again, this proves that if blacks are around or in an organization, nothing works right.  They jam up the works and make everything impossible.  Thus, community gardens won&rsquo;t work either. They&rsquo;ll just lead to fights, a lot of police work, and and maybe an increase in the homicide rate.</p>

		<p>They wanted the city, and set about getting starting it with the 67 riot. The whites that didn&rsquo;t flee the state, moved to the suburbs. Now that the city is an urban wasteland, blacks are trying to nudge their way into the suburbs demanding section 8 housing, and the cycle continues.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s that bad right now, what will be the situation this time next year?  I mean, this is not a bottoming out of the depression.  The economy is in a brief state of remission, not recovery.</p>
<p>And what will be the situation two years from now, in 2011?</p>
<p>My point is that things are still deteriorating, but at a slower rate.  That will pick up pretty soon, and even the stock market may take a nose dive further down than the first time.</p>
<p>Things are bad in Detroit right now.  It will be VERY interesting to see how they handle REAL hardship over the next couple of years.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt they&rsquo;d kill you for a head of lettuce or a tomato. Just this week there was a story in the news about a [black] girl in Milwaukee who stabbed her grandfather to death  over a glass of milk. <br>
Moral:  getting involved with blacks in ANY way is dangerous. If they&rsquo;d stab their own grandfather, what would they do to YOU?</p>

		<p>How many of those 60k a year auto-workers saved at least ten percent a check for a rainy day? How many had ice fishing campers, rvs, and cabins by some lake?<br>
     I know that the IRA business took a big hit; however what kept folks from not reading the financial pages or watching cnbc and bailing out when it first started dropping?<br>
     Mormons keep a 6 month supply of food, medicine and more importantly ammunition in their homes. Did these new urban poor do the same or did they buy lottery tickets, cigarettes, and liquor instead of creating a larder.<br>
     Detroit is an example of a black run city running pretty well considering the intelligence level of it`s citizens. 350,000 people with IQs under 95 must create  an asphalt, almost by definition.<br>

		<p>As an European I have followed Detroit for a couple of years.  It&rsquo;s like watching Haiti.<br>
Every one is walking on eggshells, and no one is willing to say it like it is:  All af this is happening because the Gauss curve of intelligence, is severly left-shifted in both Africa, Haiti&hellip;&hellip;..and Detroit.<br>
As long as that fact is not recognaised, no do-good interference will ever help.</p>

		<p>Black Africans in Zimbabwe also resorted to planting vegetable gardens all over Harare (Capital City) as there was no other food to be had thanks to Mugabe. They managed quite well in the circumstances although I doubt if the minority Whites, who were also suffering, went around stealing stuff but rather joined in with the others in their efforts. It would appear that the growing of vegetables is well beyond the capabilities of the Detroit blacks and, in any case, there is obviously little difference in their minds between stealing from stores and stealing from gardens as neither involve any legitimate effort in production, only in criminal activity to acquire the goods. I&rsquo;m quite surprised that the Whites didn&rsquo;t foresee what would happen and organise armed patrols even though this would seem to be a little &#8216;over the top&rsquo; in any civilised society. Personally, I would have &#8216;up sticks&rsquo; years ago rather than exist in Detroit which has been described as &#8216;New Orleans on ice&rsquo;.</p>

<p>**************************</p>
<p>The community garden that I was involved in was surrounded by a high fence and was locked at night.  Still, &#8220;neighborhood people&#8221; [it was largely a &#8220;minority&#8221; neighborhood]  would scale the fence during the night and help themselves. As it was owned by a small church, obviously it could not afford to employ anything like a night watchman.   </p>
<p>But there were people (all blacks, as I remember) who stopped outside and stared through the fence, watching us several white people and a few Hispanics toiling inside, digging and carrying pails of water (there was no piped water available).  They would watch us work, but when we invited them to come in and join, they would decline when they understood that work was involved.   Still, many would ask for handouts. (&#8220;Can I have some of those tomatoes?&#8221;)   But they would refuse to join and help with the work. </p>
<p>When we explained that this was a &#8220;community garden&#8221; and everyone was expected to  help with the work  <b><i>and grow your own,  </i></b>they would say,  &#8220;But I live in this neighborhood!   I&rsquo;m part of the community! Isn&rsquo;t this supposed to be for the community?&#8221;     Some of them got pretty indignant at the suggestion that they should have to work to get some food.   I vividly remember one woman saying,  &#8220;What!   You expect ME to get down on the ground and get MY hands in that dirt? You must be crazy!!!&#8221;   </p>
<p>Still, it was alright for you to do it, but not for them.  It was clear that these people expected  free hand-outs and were totally conditioned to that expectation.  After all, everything else in their lives was provided free.  That community garden, though it proved  useless for the vegetables,  turned out to be an amazing learning experience for me.  Very enlightening to say the least!  A real education.  It prepared me for Amren.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Community gardens&rsquo;</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, rough subsistence farming now takes place in what were once the groomed gardens of former colonial habitats.   If not for winter, Detroit would resemble contemporary Africa, with black women in the yards using mortar and pestle to grind maize, while nearby, the men lounge in the shade.</p>

<p>#3, those words sum up the entire problem with blacks.  Thanks for reducing a complex issue to nine words.  On the subject of the futility of community gardens, I heard some people discussing the hopelessness of trying to grow food in New Orleans.  These were folks describing their neighbors&rsquo; efforts to grow things in their own back yards.  Couldn&rsquo;t be done, because of the thieving.  </p>
<p>No wonder blacks are stuck in hopeless situations, all over the globe.  They generate their own hopelessness.</p>
<p>Question Diversity:  I saw something last week that confirms what you said about blacks selecting packages of meat, and then changing their minds; leaving the meat to spoil.  A black was behind me in line at the grocery.  He left a big package of pre-cooked shrimp at the checkout counter, saying to the checker that he&rsquo;d be back.  A minute later, I looked up, and the store manager was asking the checker if that was my shrimp.  But the manager said it in a way that led me to conclude that he&rsquo;d been shadowing the black man.  It&rsquo;s got to be a huge problem, if the manager of a big grocery store has to regularly spend time making sure that customers don&rsquo;t leave their meat selections out to rot.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just stores they ruin.  Now that my gym has black members, the bathroom stalls have become no-go zones.  That&rsquo;s because black males don&rsquo;t put up the seats when they &#8216;go&rsquo;.  In the twenty three years I&rsquo;ve been a member, this is the first time there&rsquo;s been a problem like this.  What is missing from their brains, to make them behave so thoughtlessly?</p>

<p>Oh, don&rsquo;t get me started on gyms.  The second to the last one I belonged to when I was still living in St. Louis was one in Downtown St. Louis, a chain you might have heard of, though I won&rsquo;t mention the name.  It was probably one of the worst decisions of my life.  About a third of the members were black, most of those were men, and It seemed to me that about a third of the black men who used it had no sense of personal hygeine, because one could smell some of them while they were using weights (I hardly ever saw any on treadmills or bikes or nordictracks), and my sense of smell doesn&rsquo;t work too well b/c of allergies, so that was saying a lot.  The aforementioned ones never used the club&rsquo;s showers afterward, which was probably some sort of blessing in disguise.</p>

		<p>The idea of urban farming as a solution to the problem of Detroit food shortages is ridiculous. The first thing that popped into my head when reading the article is that the gardeners would have to camp by their crops to keep them from being stolen and I notice that there are posts from people that have had precisely this experience. Black people are so predictable! Whenever Blacks have managed to take over one of our cities the result is always crime, decay and dependence. The same holds for any Black run country. When will White America wake up and stop embracing &#8220;diversity&#8221;? When will stop pretending that all races were created equal?</p>

		<p>I read many of the posts that accompanied the original article - all I can say is, no wonder Detroit is in deep muck. Many posters blame the UAW, asking why should a person be paid $ 60,000 a year for putting together a car, or tightening some bolts? Here, they&rsquo;re blaming a Democrat -voting labor union for Detroit&rsquo;s ills -do you believe it? I always thought liberals were for the working class. So why are they grousing about high wages paid to semi-skilled laborers? Other people wonder why there are no supermarkets in Detroit, actually saying that Uncle Sam should subsidize the building of them in Detroit. Of course, NO MENTION whatsoever is made of WHY the supermarkets closed in the first place.</p>
<p>However, we here at Amren know the score, don&rsquo;t we? I don&rsquo;t know about anyone else, but I&rsquo;m GLAD to see Detroit go the way of East St. Louis, IL; while its liberals pretend  they don&rsquo;t have a clue as to why it&rsquo;s happening or who is responsible. Many posters complained about the photograph of the guy with the gun protecting a shipment of food being unloaded. They claim that picture doesn&rsquo;t represent the &#8220;real Detroit&#8221;.</p>
<p>Give it another 20 years, Detroit will soon be the U.S.A.&rsquo;s largest ghost town, resembling those ghost towns in the Old West of yore.  </p>

		<p> Detroit, South Africa, Zimbaway and dozens of other places that were thriving and prosperous turned over to blacks and then totally ruined. If history is recorded truthfully, then eventually the world will simply give up on them ; go on with life and never allow it to happen again.<br>

		<p>I am actually thankful that detroit exists as it is.  Both Detroit and New Orleans are near perfect examples of black mismanagement and ignorance, right here in the USA. Someone here frequently says, &#8220;Worse is better.&#8221;  Precisely so!  As this continues to evolve, more and more intelligent people are going to see low class blacks for the feral parasites that they are, and the lame media/academia excuses for black non performance become increasingly difficult to believe. </p>

		<p>I loved that phrase &#8220;getting people to buy.&#8221; The unspoken thought being that supermarkets were DRIVEN out of Detroit, NOT from a lack of potential customers but by the very real daily occurrences of shoplifting, thefts, armed robberies, etc. Of course one must understand vocalizing this idea is politically incorrect so feel free to not believe the truth of my comment.</p>

<p>Another point is that you can&rsquo;t survive on radishes, tomatoes and lettuce. Even if noboby stole the products of your labor, it still wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to live on. And vegetables are the cheapest foods anyway.  Yes, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>

		<p>Hunger in Detroit? Hows it that possible when it annually lands on the list of the top 25 fattest cities? I believe this year, it was #12, and in 2004 they held the title of #1. Only reason it has slipped of late, is because the size of it&rsquo;s population is shrinking as it is gradually turning into a wasteland, as looters torch and destroy houses on Hellnight, and vandalize and pillage the rest on a regular basis. Yes, the numbers have slipped, but only for that reason, those that remain are still obese. </p>
