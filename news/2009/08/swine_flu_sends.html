<h1>Swine Flu Sends More Blacks, Hispanics to Hospital</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Stobbe, Google News, August 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Swine flu was four times more likely to send blacks and Hispanics to the hospital than whites, according to a study in Chicago that offers one of the first looks at how the virus has affected different racial groups.</p>
<p>The report echoes some unpublished information from Boston that found three out of four Bostonians hospitalized from swine flu were black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>The cause for the difference is probably not genetic, health officials said. More likely, it&rsquo;s because blacks and Hispanics suffer disproportionately from asthma, diabetes and other health problems that make people more vulnerable to the flu.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear if a racial or ethnic difference will hold up when more complete national data is available, one federal health official said. The findings are based on fairly small numbers of cases from the early days of the pandemic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Chicago findings, released Thursday, are believed to be the first published study to detail a racial or ethnic breakdown of swine flu&rsquo;s impact.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks with swine flu were hospitalized at a rate of 9 per 100,000, and Hispanics at a rate of 8 per 100,000. For whites, the rate was 2 per 100,000, the study found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;But intuitively it&rsquo;s understandable, because we have tremendous inequities in most areas of health,&#8221; said Ferrer [Barbara Ferrer of the Boston Public Health Commission], the agency&rsquo;s executive director.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This fall, the government will be doing national surveys to better track swine flu trends. That should provide more reliable information about how the virus is affecting different groups of people, he said.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;tremendous inequities in most areas of health&#8221; are created by the minorities who have children with inadequate financial means to support them in addition to other poor behaviors like obesity and smoking. Their poor quality of life is most often created by them, not cast upon them.</p>

		<p>Is there anything, anything at all that does not affect blacks and hispanics adversely and much more than Whites.</p>
<p>I guess &#8220;White privilege&#8221; makes us more healthy, even though blacks with their government jobs and medicaid and free clinics for those on welfare are actually more likely to be insured than Whites.</p>

		<p>Which &#8220;inequitiy&#8221; might we be refering to, please? Blacks and Hispanics have just as much access to healthcare as anyone else - more probably, when you factor in all the Medicare and who knows how mnay other programs created just for them. Among other things, this is just so much baloney to sell the massive &#8220;healthcare reform&#8221; scheme to America. </p>

		<p>Even the swine flu is racist.</p>
<p>First it was Devil&rsquo;s Food cake; then the term, &#8220;black sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if they&rsquo;re going to ask for reparations when the flu season ends?</p>

		<p>Blacks and Hispanics are far more likely to go directly to the emergency room for the most minor ailments than members of other groups.  Any emergency room clerk, nurse, or doctor can confirm this simple fact.  And swine flu symptoms are generally no more severe than those of any number of influenza infections.</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re in emergency rooms for stab wounds, gunshot injuries, and beatings far more frequently than whites and Asians also.  This, of course, is the fault of we whites and Asians who keep them chained in criminal bondage. </p>
<p>They pay nothing for their health care and so use their big freebie at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Only a sociologist could turn this fact into a condemnation of the health care system.</p>

		<p>Or, could it possibly be because whites as a whole tend to be cleaner, more sanitary, and use a little more common sense and common courtesy when around others.</p>
<p>This, however, is a terminal situation, as younger generations of whites are lowering their standards of behavior in accordance with third world levels.</p>

*********************<br>
Intuitively it&rsquo;s understandable, because Blacks (and to a smaller degree Hispanics) will scream &#8220;racism&#8221; if you don&rsquo;t admit them to the hospital for every hangnail and cough. Whites go to the doctor, get a prescription, go home and take the medicine as prescribed. Whites suck it up, deal with the discomfort and get better. Blacks are unable to do this, they lay in the hospital, moan and groan and whine for anywhere from a week to 10 days.</p>

		<p>If there is no cure or treatment for Swine Flu, then how is lack of health care a factor in contracting this disease? I assume an acute case would need support medication equal to what would be obtained in a standard American Emergency room, free access to all. So like AIDS and other diseases (Except Skin Diseases) blacks are more susceptible. Genetic? Yes.</p>

		<p>Whites not only have better sanitation and hygiene, but we tend to take better care of their health in other ways, such as trying to eat right, exercise, and take vitamins. The fact blacks and Hispanics are more likely to become morbidly obese, whereas whites generally do not unless they are very poor, is a huge clue.</p>

		<p>From first hand experience working in a couple of Emergency Departments: Low-class blacks make a visit by one person into a family reunion in the waiting room. They cannot be seen by themselves - there always seem to be a trail of hangers-on (relatives, friends, etc.) that come in and camp out in the waiting room. They will make trips to bring in food and make a big production of everything. </p>
<p>Apparently, they like it in the hospital, since we cater to them there and they don&rsquo;t feel a need to pay for anything much.  </p>
<p>If you think it is bad now, wait until our Kenyan president gets us socialized medicine.</p>

		<p>Their poor reaction probably has a genetic dimension to it. I recall reading that during the 1918 flu pandemic that certain groups were TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY THE DISEASE IN A MANNER THAT WHITEY WAS NOT. Pacific Islanders, Eskimos, etc., all died at a significant rate HIGHER than whitey. For whatever combination of reasons, these non-whitey groups just do not have the biologically based immunity that is needed for the body to recuperate. Think of the way the common cold, flu, chicken pox, measles, etc., devastated the American Indian populations in the years just after the arrival of Columbus!</p>
<p>Most blacks [??] from outward appearance are very physically robust, but &#8220;inside&#8221; there is a basic &#8220;weakness&#8221;??</p>
