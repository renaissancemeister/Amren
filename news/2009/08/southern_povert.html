<h1>Southern Poverty Law Center Has Become a Danger to America!</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Gheen, Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, August 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A once revered civil rights group named the Southern Poverty Law Center has now become a threat to the freedoms and security of American citizens due to their repeated attacks on all First Amendment rights and their utter debasement of the political process.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While in the past the SPLC has targeted &#8220;hate groups&#8221; or groups deemed racist and potentially violent, such as the KKK and Neo Nazi groups, the SPLC has recently used their reputation for fighting these groups to go after moderate and mainstream Americans, journalists, and show hosts and anchors in an attempt to suppress free speech.</p>
<p>The most recent attack from the SPLC on American freedoms has come in the public call for the firing of Lou Dobbs by SPLC President Richard Cohen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lou Dobbs did not take a position on President Obama&rsquo;s Constitutional eligibility to serve as President as a natural born citizens. Lou Dobbs simply said &#8220;President Obama needs to &#8220;produce a birth certificate&#8221;.</p>
<p>American citizens of all walks of life are regularly made to provide a copy of their original birth certificate for jobs, licenses, passports, and other documents. Therefore, it is completely reasonable that President Barrack Hussein Obama should do the same to quell the large cohort of citizens that have serious questions about his eligibility to serve in an arena where there should be no doubts!</p>
<p>God forbid that the Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s call for free speech and freedom of the press to be destroyed in one fell swoop succeed, but is not even their call for the destruction of these rights offense enough?</p>
<p>Surely there will be some far left open borders and amnesty enthusiasts, that represent less than twenty percent of the US Population on the political issues of illegal immigration, that will support the SPLC call for the firing of Dobbs because they feel they will benefit from this abridgment of Constitutional rights in America.</p>
<p>However, Lou Dobbs&rsquo;s political views are more closely aligned with the vast majority of Americans who want America&rsquo;s borders secured and our existing immigration laws enforced. An even larger majority of people will support Dobbs&rsquo;s right to say what he likes and report what he likes as an American citizen and member of the media. Thankfully, many Americans still realize that free speech is a sacrosanct pillar of our nation&rsquo;s political processes and once esteemed place in history.</p>
<p>Today, SPLC President Richard Cohen sent out another release claiming that Lou Dobbs has some association with James von Brunn, the neo-Nazi accused of killing the Holocaust Memorial Museum guard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now things have taken a new turn with the SPLC asking even their left leaning supporters to come along with them on a direct attack on free speech and the freedom of the press in America in a move that is designed to try and limit the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</p>
<p>Most of us could understand and tolerate these groups and their spokespersons having different political views than us. I even fully support their free speech and right to engage in unpopular free speech supporting their positions in support for open borders and amnesty for illegal aliens.</p>
<p>But by targeting moderate groups and commentators, smearing their names with false associations with murderous racists, and attempting to simultaneously interfere with Constitutionally protected freedoms of Americans, the SPLC has gone too far and has become a threat to the American rules, principles, ideals and freedoms necessary to allow peaceful political change and diffuse calls for violence from the extremes.</p>
<p>I personally feel that the actions of the SPLC are increasing the chances of political violence in America as this group is trying to silence free expression of concerns and redress of grievances of tens of millions of Americans. The Americans the SPLC is targeting are not some violent fringe group, they are heartland Americans of every race and political party that believe in the founding principles of the United States!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Let us speak out with one voice against the SPLC and challenge the presence and messages of their spokespeople such as Richard Cohen, Morris Dees, Mark Potok, Heidi Beirich, and others when they are masquerading as a civil rights group before the media and lawmakers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>So it was okay for the SPLC (and others) to target non-existent and illusory groups, but when you munch into my doughnut, then you&rsquo;ve crossed a line.  The reason the SPLC targeted them before and you now is that they need the money, and the well is drying up from the SPLC&rsquo;s traditional targets.  Their only recourse is to dig further down.</p>

		<p>The SPLC is a fringe group.  They like to pass themselves off as a mainstream progressive organization when in reality they are viciously anti-white, anti-american, anti-native born.  They are attemping to put a white face on mass immigration by being the media &#8220;spokespeople&#8221; for hate groups like LaRaza amd MALDEF.  If ethnic based organizations tried to peddle their hate to mid-America it would be instantly recognized for what it is.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, SPLC is quickly spending their good will and political capital they legitimately built up by attacking real hate groups.  That battle having been won, they are now jumping into immigration with a hubris that is sure to destroy whats left of their reputation.  Their credibility is gone and like junkies, they need to keep taking bigger and bigger hits to get the same high.  </p>

		<p>When was the SPLC ever reasonable and fair, as the writer states or a &#8220;revered&#8221; civil rights group? SPLC raises millions and has for years by lying smears on patriotic individuals and organizations like the Council of Conservative Citizens and many others. All of this happened long before the nonsense with Dobbs.</p>
<p>Moreover, does the SPLC ever hire a token Christian in a professional position? If not, where&rsquo;s the EEOC?  I mean if they want to change their name and purpose to the Southern Jewish Legal Center and affiliate with a group of synagogues or Jewish organizations, fine. I could care less. </p>
<p>But they do nothing about &#8220;poverty&#8221;, and represent the worst of ideology of extreme Marxist and liberal Jews. I am sure Orthodox and conservative Jews want nothing to do with SPLC any more than any conservative religious Christian group.</p>

		<p>Nearly all articles even tangent to race produced by mainsteam conservatives are pathetic. This is a prime example. White America will be the Rodney Dangerfield in any racially tinged debate until own our best interests. We MUST start all debates by stating our right to group self-defense and national self-determination.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve spent some time the last few weeks reading through the SPLC&rsquo;s &#8220;Intelligence Reports&#8221; and Gheen&rsquo;s criticism of this group strikes me as spot on. They&rsquo;ll disregard violence committed by those who&rsquo;s views they support. And then list moderate, nonviolent researchers with whom they disagree right along side coldblooded killers. It&rsquo;s obvious to me that it&rsquo;s an intimidation / smear tactic. The only thing that I can come up with is that they&rsquo;re political &#8220;mercs&#8221;. If you want to see what real extremism is check out some of the foundations that are funding the SPLC.</p>

<p>The problem is it should never have been revered.  As with most civil rights group and causes, it was merely out to destroy Christian White America.  They&rsquo;ve alwas been a threat to the freedoms and security of Christian White American citizens.  The SPLC is as dangerous to us as Osama bin Laden.  <br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the SPLC, but I know that the ADL considers the hard right wing of I&rsquo;raeli political life to be haters &#8220;extremists,&#8221; and their organizations &#8220;hate groups,&#8221; due to the decidedly undiverse and unegalitarian way they want to deal with Palestinians, and their Arab and Muslim neighbors.</p>

		<p>Solution: to (hate groups)</p>
<p>	Fight back; the solution is simple, when the (News Media) start calling whites, racist, bigots, and haters: call advertisers placing commercials on nationally broadcasted television station, CBS, NBC, ABC&hellip; and tell them that you saw their product advertised on the 6:00 o&rsquo;clock news, or other programs: inform them you have always been a loyal customer, and find it disturbed that they are taking a poison against whites; tell them you are dismayed by the newscaster portrayal of whites as racist, bigots, and haters: complain every time you hear any derogatory remark about your movement&hellip; anytime you here news casters, even mention a statistic from the NAACP, or SPLC&hellip; Complain, Complain, and Complain.  <br>

		<p>William Gheen is a Republican party operative who like Lou Dobbs has no problem with the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans through LEGAL immigration.</p>
<p>Whether or not Barack Obama was born  in America is irrelevant. He looks like a foriegner, he has the name of a foriegner and was imposed upon millions of Native Born White Americans by millions of high fertility non-white foriegners and their high fertility children. </p>

<p>I agree with the reporter, but I think SPLC is only part of the problem as it relates to a breakdown in law and order and a turn toward violence.</p>
<p>For quite a long time it has been apparent to me that the anarchists are wasting their time by advocating a call to action, because, as I&rsquo;ve often mentioned, this multicultural mish mash of tribal factions and the brainwashing of PC ideology, targeting the most gullible and most naive, is going to implode all on its own. All we have to do is wait.</p>
<p>I first mentioned that four years ago, and, as we can see, it&rsquo;s coming true today.  Today it was reported that 50% of ALL mortgage holders in the US will be paying on underwater properties by the year 2011 that are appraised for less than their outstanding mortgages.  Never mind all the other economic catastrophes that are set to occur in the coming months and years, this one fact is enough for the coup de grace on the US.</p>
<p>And green shoots?  Another Obama smokescreen to think his stimulus is working so he can push cap and trade and healthcare down our throats.</p>
<p>The game is over, and, as expected, the multicults did it all on their own.</p>

<p>According to several articles in the Los Angeles Jewish Journal over the past 6 months, many Jewish donors to various &#8220;charities&#8221; such as SPLC, NAACP, ACLU were involved in the Bernie Madoff investments and lost their money.  That is primarily why SPLC is hurting.  Bernie Madoff stole the money of the SPLC donor base.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad something good came out of the Bernie Madoff mess.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose so. No doubt.  <br>
But in fact, being&hellip;&#8221;viciously anti-white, anti-american, anti-native-born&rdquo; is simply being &#8220;mainstream&#8221; today. That&rsquo;s exactly what we have come to.</p>
