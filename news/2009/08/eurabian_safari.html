<h1>Eurabian Safari</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is hot in Brussels. Ramadan has begun. The faithful in the predominantly Muslim borough of Molenbeek are not allowed to eat or drink from sunrise until sunset. Non-Muslim policemen, patrolling the streets of Molenbeek in their sweltering cars, are not allowed to eat or drink either. As every year during Ramadan, that they have been told by their superior, Philippe Moureaux, the Socialist mayor of Molenbeek, they have to respect Muslim sensitivities and not to &#8220;provoke&#8221; Muslims by violating Islamic Ramadan restrictions in public. In effect, Islamic or Sharia law is already applied  &mdash;  for everyone  &mdash;  in the Muslim areas of Brussels.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some friends in Brussels organize one-hour trips through Molenbeek. They go in an inconspicuous car, driven by a local who knows the escape routes, and with a bodyguard. Otherwise the risk would be too great. These trips are called &#8220;safaris.&#8221; Similar &#8220;Eurabia Safaris&#8221; are organized in other European cities. One of the highlights  &mdash;  though absolutely not the most dangerous one  &mdash;  of the safari in Rosengaard, the Muslim section of the Swedish city of Malmö, is a short stop, to give the visitor the opportunity to take a quick snapshot, in front of Malmö&rsquo;s &#8220;Jihadskörkortsteori&#8221; (Jihad Driving School).</p>
<p>The Sharia areas of Europe are expanding rapidly across Western Europe. While currently still restricted to what the French officially call the ZUS (zones urbaines sensibles  &mdash;  sensitive urban areas) these areas are growing fast. Even today, eight million of the sixty million inhabitants of France already live in one of the country&rsquo;s 751 ZUS.</p>
<p>The month of Ramadan is traditionally the most dangerous time of the year in Europe&rsquo;s sensitive areas. After sunset, the Ramadan ban on eating, drinking and engaging in sexual activities expires until the following sunrise. Ramadan is a period of nightly feasts for Muslims. Young Muslims are extremely touchy. These feasts easily spill over into nightly spasms of mayhem, vandalism, and violence. Europe&rsquo;s Ramadan riots often go on for days or weeks, during which hundreds of cars, shops and public buildings are set on fire.</p>
<p>In Muslim countries, such as Indonesia, the police step up patrols during Ramadan in order to crack down on illegal nightly activities. In Europe, however, the police have been given orders to adopt an extra-low profile not to &#8220;provoke&#8221; Muslim populations. In countries such as Britain, police officers have had to attend &#8220;Ramadan awareness&#8221; courses. They have even been ordered, &#8220;for reasons of religious sensitivity,&#8221; to avoid the execution of arrest warrants for Muslims during the month of Ramadan. During Ramadan, Europe is a tinder box.</p>
<p>The most widely reported Ramadan riots so far, which were even covered by the American press, took place in France in 2005. Since the 2005 riots, the French authorities have asked the media not to report about waves of violent unrest in the ZUS  &mdash;  a request which the media seem to have followed. During the 2005 Ramadan riots, several sociologists suggested that polygamy was one of the reasons for the large-scale rioting in Muslim communities among youths who lack a father figure. This theory seemed to have impressed France&rsquo;s political leaders. Gérard Larcher, then France&rsquo;s employment minister and currently the president of the French Senate, explained to the Financial Times (Nov. 15, 2005) that multiple marriages among immigrants lead to anti-social behavior, such as criminal activity.  Bernard Accoyer, a leading parliamentarian of France&rsquo;s governing UMP and currently the president of the French National Assembly (France&rsquo;s Congress), said that children from large polygamous families have problems integrating into mainstream society.</p>

		<p>&rdquo;&hellip;sociologists suggested that polygamy was one of the reasons for the large-scale rioting in Muslim communities among youths who lack a father figure. &ldquo;  and<br>
  &ldquo;&hellip;multiple marriages among immigrants lead to anti-social behavior, such as criminal activity&hellip;&rdquo;. </p>
<p>This has a certain familiarity to it. Western  society, most notably the broken UK society now unregulated by religion, morality, societal condemnation or God forbid,judgement, has become degraded crime-ridden and anti-social.  How predictable is it that children of polygamous unions/ fatherless of any race or culture brought up in the laissez faire West will also succumb to anti-social behavior,rioting and general lawlessness.   It seems that only in their own environment under the strict Shari&rsquo;a Law where horrific punishments are administered for misbehavior can a polygamous/fatherless child become part of the social fabric. <br>
  Well I think we know whatour politicians will see as the most fitting way to solve this problem; The Introduction of Sharia law in the West.<br>
  It&rsquo;s the only way. <br>

		<p>Reading this, I can only recall with bitterness former Vice President Cheney&rsquo;s repeated platitude that we have to &#8220;fight them [Muslims] over there so we won&rsquo;t have to fight them over here.&#8221;  <p>Well, it&rsquo;s increasingly obvious, isn&rsquo;t it, that we&rsquo;ve let in and are still letting in enough of them -all of them breeding exponentially-, that we&rsquo;re very soon going to have to fight them on our own home territories.  They certainly sound like they&rsquo;re preparing for war with <b>us</b> on those terms, and it goes without saying that our traitorous ruling classes in the West will be on <i>their</i> side in any such future conflict.</p></p>

		<p>Three comments:</p>
<p>1. In an Islamic nation, Indonesia, the cops CRACK DOWN DURING THE PERIOD OF RAMADAN!! In the whitey nation, the cops DURING RAMADAN DO THINGS BACKWARDS AND TURN A BLIND EYE!!</p>
<p>2. And as usual, all sorts of socio-economic reasons are given for the &#8220;behavior&#8221; of the &#8220;youths&#8221;. The &#8220;youths&#8221; are just plain old ordinary bad people behaving in a plain old ordinary bad way!! That is all there is to it.</p>
<p>3. These ZUS are proliferating at an ever alarming rate? NO-GO zones they call them more correctly. Very clearly delineated and the cops know for fear of their lives where to go and not go!</p>
<p>Several decades ago, the French cops were involved in a car chase with bank robbers. The robbers drove into the Muslim &#8220;quarter&#8221; of Marseille. The cops stopped and refused to enter the &#8220;quarter&#8221;. To enter the &#8220;quarter&#8221; would have meant being mobbed and killed within thirty seconds or so. The cops had to gingerly approach the Muslim elders and beg for the help of the elders in apprehending the villains. I never heard what happened after that.</p>

		<p>Why not drop the pretense and prohibit arrest of persons of African, Near Eastern, or South American descent?</p>

		<p>And may I ask, for what reason did Eastern Europe fight the turks (musulman) for centuries? Hungary engaged in 1526 in a more than 150 years long, continous bitter fight against the turks to drive them out of the country and save christianity.</p>
<p>One of the main weapons in this fight was not to mix with them culturally. E.g.: Accepting sharia laws and implementing muslim habits selling christian property to muslims meant death punishment in the royal city of Kassa. </p>
<p>It took 150 years but the time was ripe in 1686. The Holy League which was a joined forces army of christians chrushed the turkes in the sige of Buda taking the greatest victory of christianity over them. In just four (?) years they were driven out of Hungary. <br>
Side note.: the jewish population of Buda deffended the city along with the turks agains the Holy League.</p>

		<p>This article is wrong. Moslems fast during the daytime. In many moslen coutries, the people sleep during the day and little work is done. After the sun sets the feast begins. Since Ramadan is based on a lunar calender, the holiday is movable. During winter, the days are short and fasting is easy. If you ever fasted for a blood test, you probably had a harder time.<br>
   This is a time of siritual renewal for moslens. Since the Jihad is important to the moslem, the number of attacks on non-moslems increases. All the more reason to ban islam from our borders. </p>
