			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol M. Swain, Huffington Post, August 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Whites are people too&#8221; is the title of a YouTube video making the rounds on the Internet. A lot of stuff is happening in the world of race relations and little of it points towards a post-racial society. {snip}</p>
<p>White desperation is manifesting itself in various forms. Last week I received an e-mail from a Jewish woman whom I shall call Hadassah who described herself as being frustrated by racial preferences and racial double standards. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Hers is one of many such e-mails I have received over the years from whites who confess to having been raised in liberal democratic-homes, but who are now flirting with white nationalism. These whites express frustration with immigration, black crime rates, racial preferences, and demographic changes reducing the percentage of non-Hispanic whites in the population. They see themselves as the &#8220;real&#8221; victims of racial discrimination, who have no recourse left other than to organize themselves for self-preservation. Many people believe that these concerns and attitudes belong to a radical fringe. I disagree.</p>
<p>Hadassah wrote:<blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>Because of the many efforts by professional race mongers such as the SPLC, the NAACP, and the like, hatred against your people has heightened to a level I have never before seen in my half-century of life on this earth. {snip}<br>
</blockquote>Hadassah&rsquo;s willingness to write me a letter suggests she is willing to engage in some sort of constructive dialogue. She is not the only Jewish person who identifies as a white nationalist. In the New White Nationalism in America, I quote two Jewish nationalist professors who expressed sentiments quite similar to Hadassah&rsquo;s: Michael Levin and Michael Hart. Hart had even gone as far as to develop a plan for partitioning the United States by race and ethnicity. Both interviews can be read in their entirety in Swain and Nieli&rsquo;s Contemporary Voices of White Nationalism.</p>
<p>More white nationalist sentiments can be found on the rather sanitized website Western Voices World Needs Downloadable flyers on the site tell of the group&rsquo;s concerns about being outnumbered by racial and ethnic minorities. There are no threats or hints of violence against minorities.</p>
<p>Jack Hunter, a conservative commentator from South Carolina, calls himself the Southern Avenger. Through Taki Magazine, Hunter has recently produced the video; Whites are People Too, which condemns racial double-standards by members of the media. {snip}</p>
<p>As I have warned repeatedly, I believe America is headed for unprecedented levels of racial turmoil. The election of President Barack Obama has not been the healing balm anticipated. If anything President Obama&rsquo;s stances have heighten rather than ameliorated existing racial and ethnic tensions. {snip}<br>

		<p>This contrasts with the story yesterday here on AR about the college students and the fact that they aren&rsquo;t as biased against blacks as they used to be.  The reason is obvious   &mdash;   the whites mentioned here by Dr. Swain are older and live in the real world, and have to suffer the consequences of liberalism.  Unlike the college students.</p>

		<p>Only 13 comments there so far, but they&rsquo;re all pretty much in lockstep: whitey, you&rsquo;ve got it coming.</p>
<p>How cute!  They say things like, &#8220;now you&rsquo;re starting to learn what minorities have felt all along!&#8221;  Wow, that&rsquo;s really going to talk whites out of ethnic nationalism, huh?  Sounds like these people are spoiling for a fight.  Now, anyway.  When the ball gets rolling I bet they&rsquo;ll be singing a different tune.  I mean, how psychotic is that, telling people, &#8220;it&rsquo;s your turn now!&#8221;?  Why not just throw a can of gasoline on a house fire?</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t bother registering there, just to have my comments removed; along those lines, the posters there just vomit up the usual leftist pap.  &#8220;Now you know how minorities have felt all along&#8221;; these are the same people who DEMANDED minorities be brought into this country, en masse!  Liberals take ZERO responsibility for the fact that brown people (AKA mestizos, &#8220;hispanics,&#8221; &#8220;latinos,&#8221; etc.) have &#8220;suffered&#8221; at the hands of whites, when it is liberals themselves who (without anything approaching a mandate) invited brown people in to suffer at the hands of evil whites!  Their hypocrisy is breathtaking!  And if you ask these poltroons why we should let in more poor brown victims, only to be tortured by the evil white man, you&rsquo;re castigated for a racist neanderthal!  It doesn&rsquo;t take a math genius put 2 and 2 together here and see damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don&rsquo;t white-hatred (leftism) for what it is.</p>
<p>In these people&rsquo;s echo-chamber cuckoo-bird world, whites are going to just throw themselves under the bus.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on that.  Eventually white Americans are going to remember the terms &#8220;freedom of association&#8221; and &#8220;self-determination.&#8221;  Then a great many of them will walk away from the suicidal project that is the left, leaving this motley of defectives, limousine liberals, champagne socialists, and assorted ethnics to their own devices.  And it&rsquo;s going to have to be something a bit more permanent than so-called &#8220;white flight&#8221; (modern American euphemism for ethnic cleansing), because if we&rsquo;ve seen anything proven for a certainty, it&rsquo;s the fact that, when the chips are down, the aforementioned motley will do ANYTHING short of taking up arms to follow productive white Americans wherever they go.  So we&rsquo;re going to need some good fences to make the left into good neighbors when we set up our own house.</p>
<p>All men have the right to build their own communities, free from marauders, interlopers, freeloaders, and the otherwise unwelcome.</p>

		<p>it does seem that jews are starting to be lumped in with whites. after all, it used to be only whites were capable of committing so called genocide and war crimes. i suspect this is a consequence of of jews falling out of favor with the black community, hell hath no wrath like a race scorned. as someone of white and jewish heritage i am truly heartened to see other jews shaking off liberal thinking. for the most part the jewish community still seems to be on the left on every issue. i&rsquo;m sure that the rational majority of jews will one day wake up and see what importing muslims has done to the jews of europe and what creating class war (the majority of jews are well off) by importing impoverished and ethnocentric mexicans has done to america. i hope to see more good news like this.</p>

		<p>Those who commented on the original article write as if America&rsquo;s ethnic composition has always been largely multi-racial, and that the Whites have lorded over it at the expense of the other races.  The fact is that up until 1965 the country was 90+% White.  Additionally, they can&rsquo;t fathom that for all the non-White &#8220;minorities,&#8221; living in America or Native European lands, there exist other countires in the world where their ethnic cohorts hold complete dominion.  They don&rsquo;t understand that such places are disappearing for Whites.  They see it as a matter of their &#8220;rights,&#8221; and we see it as a matter of our survival.  It&rsquo;s their faces that now pepper our communities, not the other way around.  Whites are faced with becoming a people in exile.  The others will always have Africa, Mexico/South America, Asia, and The Middle East.  Can&rsquo;t we have a place?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think the term &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; is very useful because it can mean anyone from a Jewish race realist to a hard core neo-Nazi in the Aryan Nations.  I prefer &#8220;White Advocate&#8221; and &#8220;Race Realist&#8221; myself.</p>
<p>The Huffington Post is a pro-Obama leftist web site, so naturally the comments there are all from people who favor making whites a minority while preserving the pervasive anti-white discrimination in our institutions.  Those type of people won&rsquo;t wake up until they&rsquo;ve been mugged by a gang of blacks and have been denied adminssion to the university they wanted to attend because lower scoring people of color were given preferences.</p>

		<p>I think the thing that showed me the most clearly what has happened as a direct result of affirmative action legislation and illegal immigration is   &mdash;   the educational standards that I knew, respected, and did well in in the early 1970&rsquo;s have been watered down to levels barely above incompetence, all for the purpose of &#8220;creating a level playing field&#8221; for those who theretofore were not bright enough to handle a college educational experience.  I went to grad school in 1976-7 and the standards were uncompromisingly tough; you had to be one hell of acholar to get past the mandatory &#8220;written&#8221; exams that would let you in to the Ph.D. program.  Later down the path of life, in 1997, I again went to grad school   &mdash;   and what was required for a master&rsquo;s degree in education was laughable.  Read the text, show up for some lectures, and take a comprehensive exam.  That is IT.  Any idiot who could read could do that.  So, yes, the whites have bent over backwards to try and accommodate the incompetent blacks and others of minority race   &mdash;   and they have accomplished nothing but to cheapen the meaning of college graduate degrees as they produce more graduates but decidedly less QUALITY graduates.  I&rsquo;m not in a science field, thank God, but anyone who goes to a &#8220;minority&#8221; doctor who graduated any later than 1977 is asking for big trouble.  Don&rsquo;t be a fool - do your homework and don&rsquo;t patronize the lowquality &#8220;professionals&#8221; who came out of universities with extremely lowered standards.  Your life might depend on it.</p>

		<p>Most White Nationalists would not accept Hadassah into their community and would regard this article as a diversion to play off one race against another.  Blacks would be nothing but a minor annoyance if it weren&rsquo;t for certain groups empowering them.</p>

<p>Duh. Knew that would happen.</p>
<p>I was at a 99% White vacation spot last week, and the thing that most impressed me was how Whites keep to themselves, mind their own business and don&rsquo;t impose themselves on others in any way. In restaurants, streets, stores, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if there are crowds, there&rsquo;s just peace and quiet. </p>
<p>Whites aren&rsquo;t agitators and troublemakers. They&rsquo;re victims.</p>

<p>Please, not &#8216;race realist&rsquo;. If you slur your words, or if the listener is barely paying attention, it sounds like &#8216;racist&rsquo;. Regardless, that&rsquo;s the definition it will be given. And that&rsquo;s a shame because most &#8216;racists&rsquo; are simply whites who have already been exposed to/had their eyes opened to the racism of non-whites and they don&rsquo;t want to experience more. </p>

		<p>I suspect that any increase in white conciousness is due more to a growing realization that blacks simply cannot be assimilated proportionately at all levels in a Euro-centric society.  As a group they lack the intelligence, work ethic, and persistence to be represented in all strata of an advanced and highly technological civilization.</p>
<p>I suspect that even the most blindly ardent liberal knows this, though he likely would deny it, even at the threat of imminent death.  </p>
<p>This is a reality that simply can&rsquo;t be denied much longer, and to the extent that it is, the reckoning likely will be all the more terrible when it comes.</p>
<p>A good start would be the immediate suspension of affirmative action programs for the benefit of any group whatsoever.  Blacks, Hispanics, or whomever simply cannot achieve up to their potential, whatever that might prove to be, while enjoying privileges denied to all others.</p>
<p>Having such set-asides and racial privileges is not only a social abomination.  It&rsquo;s totally and absurdly counter-productive in the bargain, ensuring as nothing else could that underachieving groups will never reach their potential.</p>

<p><br>
I agree with this, I have a picture of a neo-Nazi when I hear the term &#8220;White nationalist&#8221;, I think that anyone else who is new to conservatism and race realism would think the same. I have met Jews and others who were liberal speaking about Blacks in hushed whispers, saying things that they would never even repeat around others of the same beliefs. Whites are tired of being second class citizens at the hands of AA and other preferential programs and are starting to rebel against it.</p>

		<p>I see racial imtimidation of whites everyday :aided by the MSM,and all cultural influentials (especially governments, public schools, movies and employers forced to comply with AFF/EOE.<br>
In an attempt to satisfy black minorities in the 60&rsquo;s government subordinated the heritage of USA to please a few.  With mass poverty immigrations from everywhere the white population is being displaced by rapidly reproducing entitlement minorities.  They can intimidate US and they may eventually out number US and they will also finally pay for the consequences.  I am offended to live under a government that has stolen my heritage, my hard earned money and my safety to please those who merely buy votes from anti American prostitutes.        V</p>

		<p>Really good comments here so far.</p>
<p>From the original article: &#8220;Fox commentator Glenn Beck has been targeted by groups demanding his removal for having had the gall to call President Obama a racist who hates white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>I seem to remember some rap star, after hurricane Katrina, saying &#8220;George Bush hates black people&#8221;, but nothing much came of that, even though Glenn Beck&rsquo;s comment is much more likely to be true.</p>
<p>As for the comment at the HP Svigor mentioned, &ldquo;now you&rsquo;re starting to learn what minorities have felt all along!&rdquo;, it just goes to show that these &#8220;minorities&#8221; just want revenge for their so-called &#8220;injustices&#8221;, not the idea of &#8220;social justice&#8221; that is so frequently spouted (as I&rsquo;m sure most of you here at AmRen have already figured out).  The attitude is &#8220;justice for us&#8221; and &#8220;revenge for whitey&#8221;, which, to them, are one in the same (this seems to be the way it&rsquo;s working in South Africa).</p>
<p>Of course, this begs the question as to WHY they (blacks, mostly, but Hispanics too) want revenge, and the #1 cause of it is that white liberals and Leftists have taught them for decades, up to this very moment, that they are all victims of whitey and thus are entitled to hate him.</p>
<p>I think I am now learning what the term &#8220;race traitor&#8221; means, in a broader and much more potent sense than just, for example, dating or marrying a person outside one&rsquo;s own race.  We (whites) have done it to ourselves, folks, and we need to look to our own ranks first to stop the madness.</p>
<p>All of this is just preaching to the choir, of course, but thanks for letting me rant.  I&rsquo;m relatively new here.  :)</p>

		<p>I am glad to see Jeff&rsquo;s comments above.  I hope that Jews will team up with White Nationalists in defense of Judeo-Christian civilization.  Such a partnership may be our only hope.  Jews have got to get over their fear of Nazism and realize that they will once again be a persecuted minority once all whites are the minority.  Since Jews hold most of the elite positions of American power, European-Americans cannot succeed in a cultural defense without them.  Come on Jews, wake up!  If the U.S. becomes a non-white country,  you <b><i>and</i></b> the Aryans face a potential holocaust!</p>

		<p>&#8220;As I have warned repeatedly, I believe America is headed for unprecedented levels of racial turmoil. The election of President Barack Obama has not been the healing balm anticipated. If anything President Obama&rsquo;s stances have heighten (sic) rather than ameliorated existing racial and ethnic tensions.&#8221;</p>
<p>She has it right on.  Of all the blacks who offer their opinion in writing she&rsquo;s one of the few who think in rational terms, as does Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell, and I&rsquo;m not saying that because they&rsquo;re conservatives, but because it&rsquo;s true.  It&rsquo;s an objective evaluation.  </p>
<p>The writing of so many blacks on the left doesn&rsquo;t stand up to logic and reason, and it&rsquo;s apparent they&rsquo;ve been awarded their positions for the same reason all black positions are awarded:  The elites want to include as many blacks into the mainstream as they can, because they don&rsquo;t want them to be a disaffected minority bent on rebellion.  They&rsquo;ve determined that inclusion is an assurance we have peace and, following that tactic, they believe their money, power and position, are safe. They&rsquo;re wrong, of course.  They&rsquo;ve done no more than create a kind of sub-standard class of writers and other &#8220;professionals&#8221; who do more to foment racism than guarantee the power and financial positions of the out-of-touch, so-called &#8220;elites.&#8221; Look at Michelle Obama.  No white has been generously awarded so much for such a low level of intellect, yet it is those just like her who are the biggest dissenters and hate mongers against the white population.</p>
<p>But Swain and others genuinely are trying to suggest a solution to the racial problem.  However, there are so few of them they can&rsquo;t make any kind of impression on blacks, but a lack of numbers isn&rsquo;t the only problem.  Even if there were more, I doubt that most of the black population could understand anything of what they advocate, so it all goes for naught.</p>
<p>Blacks are determined to &#8220;take over,&#8221; or at least a very large percentage of them think in terms of control and domination.  They&rsquo;re far too arrogant to ever believe this country would look like Zimbabwe, South Africa, Detroit, and New Orleans, if they had control.</p>
<p>Blacks are egged on and given favoritism not only by their corrupt leaders but also by mentally disturbed, programmed white robots, who disingenuously try to push the notion blacks are equal to all other peoples of the earth.  They take that stance out of fear.   Plain and simply they&rsquo;re cowards.  These types believe they are placating blacks with false claims of equality and, in that manner, will keep themselves safe from reprisals by most all blacks who hold mythical beliefs of being held back because of the after effects of slavery, rather than accepting the truth that they just can&rsquo;t compete.</p>
<p>Probably the best example of low black intellect is widespread failure.  No matter how many examples of failed societies there are, and have been, throughout the history of mankind, blacks can&rsquo;t understand that it wasn&rsquo;t slavery or white oppression that prevented them from advancing on the same level as most other peoples of the earth, but their own incompetence. Examples of black run mostly black cities that have degenerated to a third world level here in this country make no impression on them either.  It&rsquo;s much more soothing to their egos to believe that they&rsquo;ve been held down by whitey.</p>
<p>Carol Swain wants to give whites more of a voice in the racial debate, eliminating any barriers for them to speak honestly.  Such dialogue, she believes, will eventually mollify racial tensions.</p>
<p>What she&rsquo;s not understanding is the low intellect of her own people, generally, and their lack of impulse control, along with a propensity for crime and violence, as the real problems in bringing racial tensions to the brink and that the corrections she desires to improve the situation lie not with whites, but with blacks.  And blacks just aren&rsquo;t capable enough to understand just what their role should be in any kind of attempts at reconciliation.  They can&rsquo;t find common ground with anyone on any problem if they&rsquo;re incapable of understanding the reasons the problem exists.</p>
<p>She needs to understand also that it doesn&rsquo;t take two sides to have a war.  Blacks have been engaged in low intensity conflict against whites for generations now, and those like Jeremiah Wright, Louis Farrakhan, plus dozens of similar black &#8220;leaders,&#8221; most especially Barack Obama, egg it all on by claiming  the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; has been created and maintained by the &#8220;outrageous treatment of blacks&#8221; in this society.  </p>
<p>That the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; exists between blacks and ALL other people in the US doesn&rsquo;t seem to resonate with them or they choose to ignore it, hoping that particular fact isn&rsquo;t brought forward by anybody, because it hasn&rsquo;t been so far.  Instead everybody plays a game called &#8220;Let&rsquo;s pretend that blacks are equal with whites,&#8221; during which they follow rules of the game which has as its basis an indisputable premise of white racism and oppression.  And the game continues daily working towards trying to stop whitey from holding them down.  </p>
<p>Obama stupidly is going to try to close this gap by forcing unqualified blacks into the professions, most dangerously, doctors, with a kind of quota system, which is included in his healthcare Obamanation.</p>
<p>That mind-set, plus the black group mind-set in general will be the reason for our next civil war.  Plummeting economic conditions will bring about the conflict much sooner, but, economic plummet or not, no society can exist for very long based on so many oulandish and egregious lies connected with its racial problems.   </p>
<p>Right now the hate-filled black populaton, for the most part, looks for any opportunity it can to right mythical wrongs, and that&rsquo;s not going to change even if they have complete control.  Looking for a way to correct white attitudes and thinking to solve the racial situation ignores the basis of the problem completely, and that&rsquo;s not apt to change&hellip;&hellip;..so IMHO that makes racial conflict a certainty.</p>

<p>This is very true. Prepare yourselves. I am 38 and began training in jiu jitsu three years ago. It seems ridiculous for someone my age to be doing this, but I want to protect my family and myself. I also recommend firearms training. Local ranges will train anyone&hellip;from children to elderly women. There is an appropriate firearm for every age and strength level. If you are an adult, I suggest krav maga. That is Isreali self-defense. It is deadly, and easy-to-learn. Whether your a 100 lb woman or a 300 lb man&hellip;learn it. </p>
<p>I have middle class black and hispanic friends who agree with me and do the same. They are the first to warn about their own people. Their own people are attacked most often due to proximity.</p>
<p>Put down your martinis and get your heads out of the sand. Learn how to fight back. </p>

		<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m in an extra-cranky mood today, but I&rsquo;m sick &amp; tired of all this intellectual  about what to call ourselves and who is/isn&rsquo;t worthy of being in our group!</p>
<p>Non-whites did not reach their current position of total domination over whites by theorizing.  They got organized, got active, and persevered.</p>
<p>In my experience, most whites are happy to complain.  And you can get them to meetings, which they think are like the stage version of a Michael Savage or Rush Limbaugh radio show   &mdash;   show up and get entertained.  But ask them to volunteer for anything, contact their elected reps, donate money, hand out flyers, attend public rallies, support candidates and you get nothing but excuses.  &#8220;It won&rsquo;t do any good.&#8221; &#8220;No money.&#8221; &#8220;Gotta work that day.&#8221; &#8220;Gotta take my kids to school.&#8221;  &#8220;Can&rsquo;t stand up that long with my bad back.&#8221; &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want my neighbors to see me.&#8221; &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to get hurt.&#8221;    </p>
<p>The life-cycle of most white activists is very short.  They come in all excited, spouting stuff they heard on talk radio.  They participate in one or two events.  Then   &mdash;   when they have not changed the world   &mdash;   they get discouraged and drop out.  Marxists struggle their lifetime just to move the ball a few yards forward.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, but it&rsquo;s frustrating that given the current perilous situation for whites, so few are willing to take a risk or suffer an inconvenience.</p>

		<p>Over 50% of all the Jews in the US live in either New York or California with a large chunk of the rest living in south Florida.  These are all areas that are being swamped by mass immigration. Demographically, Jews are in the same boat as whites.  It will be an interesting thing to watch as many Congressional and Senatorial seats that are currently held by Jews become Hispanic or &#8220;minority&#8221; held seats.  The Democratic party coalition between liberal whites, Jews and minorities will eventually turn to infighting as the minorities grow in numbers and decide that they don&rsquo;t need to be led by the elite liberal white that currently hold sway over the left.  </p>

<p>The point of no return has been reached. There will be no happy landing. There is now a lethal mix of explosive peopulation growth-100 percent non-white-and resource scarcity. There is enough to go around to make everyone happy.</p>
<p>California is the future. And the future is  unfolding right before or eyes. To top things off the American West experiencing its worst drought in 500 years. </p>
<p>The most likely scenario is that at some point in time Native Born White Americans will ralize that their children and grand children are going to have a future where their geneline-especially the current generation of young Native Born White Males are going to face massive discrmination and econmic redundancy. If Native Born White Americans found this to be too intolerable, then the US will be on the road for a race war. I will so that at this point in time that this is a high probability event.</p>
<p>Some people think racial partitioning of the US into raced-based microstates will prevent this from happening. As I have argued here on American Renassaince, even if the US is partitioned into race-based micro nation  states, there will still be a race war.</p>

		<p>An excellent post by Svigor. That is it, in a nutshell: non-whites INSIST on moving into white countries, or moving into previously all white areas within those countries, and then have the cheek to complain about white people, who clearly don&rsquo;t want to live around non-whites.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t make it up. It&rsquo;s the same as if somebody barged past you when you opened your front door, sat on your settee and proceeded to eat your food, and then COMPLAINED at you, when you threw them out of the house!</p>
<p>White people are certainly waking up. Ten years ago I was all for &#8216;racial equality&rsquo;, that was, until I moved house and had to live in the middle of &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. Now all I want to do is get out and live among my own people. Who said that was a crime?</p>

		<p>Some of you may be amazed that Professor Swain could have such a different perspective than almost all other blacks. I have a theory. Researching her background, I see she has a background as a Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness, although no longer one (same as me).</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a culture within a culture. They see themselves as no part of this world. So they&rsquo;re trained to see mainstream thought from the outside. This no doubt, in part, made her what she is.</p>

		<p>So in a debate on national TV with an immigration enthusiast it would go something like this:</p>
<p>Jared Taylor:And why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of being reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority? How would this be in their interests.? Can you give Native Born White Americans a reason to be in favor of this?</p>
<p>Post-1965 hindu in a debate with a White Nationalist on national TV:hindu immigration enthusaiast:Without asians white Americans would never be able to produce America&rsquo;s scientists,engineers,medical doctors,nurses and computer preogrammers. The economic health of America requires reducing White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority.<br>
It is our turn now, and there is nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>White Nationalist:Both of your points are bold-face lies. Asians in America are insisting that Native Born White Americans the racial group that founded and created America commit racial suicide within the borders of America. Native Born White Americans are no under obligation to commit racial suicide in the Nation they founded to please asian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS and their offspring. Asians in America are clearly waging-along with Barack Obama- a vicious race war against Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Its no more complicated than this. Do not sidetracks debates with arcane discussions about psychometrics.</p>

		<p>Tim McHugh  &mdash;  Pastor Manning explains in great detail the definition of a long legged mack daddy in another of his Youtube episodes, but it basically breaks down as follows: There are pimps and players and there are macks. Macks pimp pimps. Mack daddys are the upper echelon of pimp pimps. Long leggeed mack daddys are those who acquire international mobilty and access to the highest salons of power. The pimp the pimps of queens, dukes, imans, etc.</p>

		<p> &#8220;think the thing that showed me the most clearly what has happened as a direct result of affirmative action legislation and illegal immigration is  &mdash;  the educational standards that I knew, respected, and did well in in the early 1970&rsquo;s have been watered down to levels barely above incompetence&hellip;&#8221; Clairmont White Lady</p>
<p>  Madame, having worked in academia for over thirty years, I can concur with everything you say. The quality of education, outside of certain of the hard sciences, has fallen off a cliff. I may also add that some of the Third World doctors, who are certified to practice in the United States, are of the same dismal quality. You may be taking a risk by going to them for a serious aliment.</p>

		<p>Anonymous: <i>Please, not &lsquo;race realist&rsquo;. If you slur your words, or if the listener is barely paying attention, it sounds like &lsquo;racist&rsquo;. Regardless, that&rsquo;s the definition it will be given. And that&rsquo;s a shame because most &lsquo;racists&rsquo; are simply whites who have already been exposed to/had their eyes opened to the racism of non-whites and they don&rsquo;t want to experience more.</i></p>
<p>If you are a white advocate you ultimately have to be a race realist as well.  Suppose our government suddenly did a 100% turn and slashed immigration, deported illegal aliens, eliminated all forms of affirmation action and racial preferences, and eliminated all laws telling us whom we must hire and to whom we must sell our property.  What would happen?  Asians on the whole would continue to do just fine.  Whites would do somewhat better than they do now (no more discrimination against them).  Jews would continue to be overrepresented in the &#8220;brain&#8221; professions.  But Hispanics and blacks would do worse, no longer having affirmation action set aside jobs to prop them up.  All this would be the result of a meritocracy, and I and I suspect most people here would have no problem with that.  But blacks and Hispanics would be outraged, and so would their liberal egalitarian white fellow travelers.  Because they accept no explanation for unequal outcomes *other* than &#8220;racism&#8221;, the pressure for reestablishing affirmative action would be unrelenting.  Only if you accept the reality of intrinsic average racial and ethnic differences can you accept the consequences of a meritocracy.<br>

		<p><i>&#8220;Hadassah&rsquo;s willingness to write me a letter suggests she is willing to engage in some sort of constructive dialogue. She is not the only Jewish person who identifies as a white nationalist. In the New White Nationalism in America, I quote two Jewish nationalist professors who expressed sentiments quite similar to Hadassah&rsquo;s: Michael Levin and Michael Hart. Hart had even gone as far as to develop a plan for partitioning the United States by race and ethnicity. Both interviews can be read in their entirety in Swain and Nieli&rsquo;s Contemporary Voices of White Nationalism.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And they can include me in their ethnic origins and concerns for the survival of White America and the White West in general, and the fact that I&rsquo;m already an ethno-Nationalist who, in my case, is also an active member of the UK British National Party too.</p>
<p>The partioning of America is a programme that is now inevitable due to deliberately engineered pernicious global influences created and orchestrated by certain political forces and their renegade allies behind the New World Order. <br>

<p>It involves contradicting and verbally hammering every Leftist Liberal whenever and wherever one encounters them.  Personally, I find doing so, increasingly rewarding and self-satisfying.</p>
