			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Boyer, Philadelphia Inquirer, August 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Bucks County woman who had been robbed and left bleeding outside the Tweeter Center in Camden just didn&rsquo;t behave well as a crime victim, or so police thought.</p>
<p>Camden Detective Maurice Gibson, who alleges that Kimberly Halpin made racial slurs in describing her assailants, decided that she should be handcuffed, arrested, and jailed.</p>
<p>Their he-said, she-said trial landed before U.S. District Judge Renee Bumb this week. And a jury of five women and three men unanimously decided yesterday that the detective fabricated information to justify the June 19, 2004, arrest.</p>
<p>Halpin, 29, who is white and now works as a substance and alcohol abuse counselor, sued Camden police for false arrest after she was charged with disorderly conduct while trying to report that she had been mugged as she left an all-day music festival at the Tweeter Center.</p>
<p>Gibson, who is African American and has been a police officer for 16 years, said he tried to take Halpin&rsquo;s report, but she cried too much, was irate, cursed, and then twice used the &#8220;N-word&#8221; in describing the two assailants who took her backpack, purse, car keys, money, and cell phone.</p>
<p>The slur, which Halpin insists she never said, is why Halpin was locked up, Gibson testified.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gibson, frustrated with Halpin, said she couldn&rsquo;t articulate what happened and twice said she was knocked down by two people, using a racial slur to describe them.</p>
<p>Gibson said he then locked her up, fearing her words might incite others who had come to the station. Halpin, who was then a criminal justice major, said the detective locked her up because she was emotional, and accused her of making racial slurs only after she threatened to sue. At one point, she passed out in the cell, overwhelmed with emotion, she testified.</p>
<p>In instructing the jury before deliberation, Bumb told it that under the law, cursing or uttering racial slurs alone is not justification for a disorderly-conduct arrest. The officer had to believe that the words could lead to a disturbance to justify the arrest, the judge said.</p>
<p>In a questionnaire, the jury members said they believed Halpin used foul language and yelled during her interaction with Gibson, but they did not believe she made racial remarks or had been flailing her arms, as Gibson testified.</p>
<p>The jury decided that there was no basis for arrest and that Gibson acted maliciously. In awarding damages, however, the jury gave only $1 in compensation and $100 in punitive damages. Her attorney told the jury that Halpin was not seeking compensation. More important to her was to recognize that she was falsely arrested.<br>

<p>So, someone who has been brutalized and robbed should be calm and orderly, should never be upset and should never slip and utter a nasty word.  In other words, a white crime victim must be ever so nice or they go to jail.<br>

		<p>One of my eye opening media  moments was when a story about a wilding attack stated in its  text   that the woman assaulted &#8220;may have been using racial language.&#8221; And one of the posters commented, &#8220;Really?!? Do you truly believe that?!?&hellip;I`m a six foot 235 lb man. And frankly, If I`M  not calling a pack of two dozen aggressive 15-18 yr. olds on a bus vile names,  I doubt a woman over fifty with an armful of groceries is&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is twice now, in a short amount of time that a white has won a law suit against a black racist thug(s) and the jury hasn&rsquo;t awarded about a million dollars as it should.</p>
<p>Having to endure jail after being a victim of black thugs, then being a victim again at the hands of another black thug, merits punitive damages at a minimum of a million dollars.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting to get decisions to go our way now, but the juries are still too timid to bring in greater damages. (Or was it comprised of several blacks?)</p>
<p>This black cop does what blacks do constantly in this country, and that is lie, whether they&rsquo;re police, judges, doctors, lawyers, politicians, or just general, run of the mill black thugs.  He also made the mistake of thinking that using the N word is a crime.  It isn&rsquo;t.  He made one more incompetent decision in a long line of incompetent decisions that blacks are infamous for.  </p>
<p>The police aren&rsquo;t going to change their behavior unless it costs them lots of money.</p>
<p>This woman should sue the black individually for acting out of personal vindictiveness and then garnish his paycheck every payday for payments toward the amount she might be awarded. That would be true justice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering how many of these jurers were black bigots.</p>

		<p>We find the one dollar and $100 in punitive damages an outrageous miscarriage of justice.  If the situate were reverse multiply that by ten million.  But the truth is Kimberly Halpin is one lucky American woman.</p>
<p>What really happened is what blacks say happens to them when they falsely claim that white cops mistreat them.  The black officer did not like the fact that blacks assaulted a white woman.  In the black woman&rsquo;s brain the race issue brings on an epileptic fit of white hatred.  So the black officer did everything in her power to irritate the white woman who was already in a bad way after the attack..</p>
<p>Whenever you are confronted with a black person do everything to get out of it.  Here she was lucky that the blacks did not rape and kill her.  From one encounter with blacks she moved to another as she had to deal with a black woman cop.  </p>
<p>As we all know it would be another attack on her.  But she is a brainwashed average American and clueless.  She was lucky that the black woman cop didn&rsquo;t shoot her and claim she was attacker by a deranged white racist.<br>

<p>From the article as found at the provided link: </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;She [Kimberly Halpin, white victim of black crime] could find no officers on the first floor as she wandered before taking the elevator to the second floor, she testified. There, she found a window, but still no police.</p>
<p>She pushed the buzzer, waited, buzzed, waited, and kept buzzing about every 15 seconds, she testified. She was scared and began to hyperventilate, she said, before an agitated Gibson came to the window and demanded to know her problem.</p>
<p>It sounds as if that department is in need of a shakeup. It should begin with the firing of &#8220;African American&#8221; (not &#8220;black,&#8221; not &#8220;colored,&#8221; not &#8220;afro-American,&#8221; and certainly not &#8220;N-word&#8221;) detective Maurice Gibson. </p>

		<p>Incredible. You can now be arrested for saying the N word. I would type it out myself right now if I knew this post would be approved even if I did, just to excerise my right to free speech. I wonder if this black cop would have arrested a black woman if a white person had robbed her, and she started yelling about honkeys, and crackers and rednecks? What a silly question, of course not. He probably would have agreed and had a laugh with her.</p>

		<p>Justice is indeed sweet isn&rsquo;t it? I think that whites are about done taking black&rsquo;s (insert your favorite word here) now that Obama&rsquo;s been elected. All the cries of &#8220;there&rsquo;s still racism&#8221; are starting to fall on more and more deaf ears. </p>

		<p>Ya know, I grew up in a number of small, rural towns around the country and I associated with people who the urban types would probably describe as &#8220;red-necks&#8221;. I can count on one hand the number of times I&rsquo;ve heard &#8220;The N-Word&#8221; used. It was only heard in private settings and never directed at a particular person. To hear the blacks tell it however, most whites can barely get through a day without screaming the vilest of epithets at any minority they see. As if all whites had tourette&rsquo;s syndrome.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that I find it very unlikely that this woman started dropping N-bombs all over a Black cop she was trying to get help from.  </p>

		<p>I look forward to the millions of arrests of blacks that will be made when our police collar each and every brother and sister who uses the n&hellip;.r word. Hell, I&rsquo;ll bet some black cops call each other the dreaded word too! Perhaps whites should insist they be addressed as &#8220;superior&#8221; by blacks. That way we don&rsquo;t have to talk to them at all, unless they let us use their secret code word, n&hellip;.r.</p>

Hhhmmmmmmm, She just got mugged and then is arrested because the black officer obviously sympathzes with the thugs more than the victim. Then proves it by arresting her on the flimsiest of charges..That pretty much means lots of black police officers are reserving the right to arrest white victims. Bantu genes run true to their african brethern&hellip;One wonders if he ever really wanted to &#8220;protect and serve&#8221;.    </p>

<p>I have already read of at least one case like this.  I&rsquo;m sure there are others.  It&rsquo;s pretty much standard now for black criminals who violently assault whites to say theat they were called the N word as an excuse.  </p>

He also made the mistake of thinking that using the &#8216;N&rsquo; word is a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>But make no mistake, in the Reign of Holder &amp; Obama, it soon will be.   (Hate speech, you know.)</p>
<p>Another point:  It&rsquo;s interesting that she was a Criminal Justice major. That means that she would have some good knowledge about crime and police procedures. Thus, he was not dealing with a dummy.  She possibly knew more about crime than this &#8220;detective&#8221; did,  and she was frustrated by his (and the other officers&rsquo;)  lack of professionalism!</p>
<p>Incidentally, that&rsquo;s a fine way to run a police station: that anyone can just walk in, wander all around at midnight, and find no cops anywhere in sight on the first or second floors!   Where were they &hellip; sleeping?   (Probably.)  </p>
<p>Well, Camden is another Chocolate City. What can you expect?</p>
<p> <i>Camden is  now 1/6th white.  Based on statistics reported to the FBI, Camden was the third-most dangerous city in the United States during 2002, and has been ranked the nation&rsquo;s most dangerous city in 2004 and 2005.  &#8220;Most dangerous city&#8221; is based on crime statistics in six categories: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and auto theft.Morgan Quitno Corporation has ranked Camden in the top ten most dangerous cities in America since 1998, when they first included cities with populations below 100,000. It was ranked the most dangerous overall in 2004 and 2005  </i><br>

		<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be stretching the limits of believability to find out that the cop that tossed the crime victim in a cell was related to,or in cahoots with the assailants.</p>
<p>&#8220;In cahoots with&#8221; is a bit of a stretch,granted. </p>
<p>There are other possible explanations,and I can think of a number without even refilling my coffee. But why bother?</p>
<p>The bottom line-and this incident is just another item to reinforce  what is already known by white people in this country-is that blacks cannot be trusted to treat white people in a fair and evenhanded manner. Of course,the black demands for &#8220;fair and equal&#8221; treatment over the past 4 decades are demands for anything but &#8220;fair and equal.&#8221; They got &#8220;fair and &#8220;equal&#8221;,plus a lot extra,a long time ago.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think they really want superiority,like a lot of people here claim. Superiority is a lot of work,and deep down,most blacks have an extreme aversion to work. I think that what they want is to have their cake and eat it too. They want unhindered access to all the good things that western civilization provides. Fast food,electronics,air conditioning,clean water that&rsquo;s available at the turn of a lever,fast cars,you name it. </p>
<p>But for the most part,they aren&rsquo;t willing to pitch in and do their share of work to get this stuff,or to maintain it once they have it. So I say that separation is a very good idea.</p>
