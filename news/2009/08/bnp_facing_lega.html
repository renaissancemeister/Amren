			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, August 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission today began legal action against the British National Party over concerns about ethnic restrictions of its membership.</p>
<p>The Commission issued county court proceedings against the party after voicing concerns in June about the BNP&rsquo;s constitution and membership criteria.</p>
<p>The BNP responded by saying that it intended to clarify the word &#8220;white&#8221; on its website, but the Commission said it believed the party will continue to discriminate against potential or actual members on racial grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The BNP&rsquo;s membership criteria appear to restrict membership to those within what the BNP regards as particular &#8220;ethnic groups&#8221; and those whose skin colour is white. This exclusion is contrary to the Race Relations Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission believes the BNP&rsquo;s constitution and membership criteria are discriminatory and, further, that the continued publication of them on the BNP website is unlawful. It has therefore issued county court proceedings against party leader Nick Griffin and two other officials,&#8221; said the Commission in a statement.</p>
<p>John Wadham, group director, Legal at the Equality and Human Rights Commission said: &#8220;The BNP has said that it is not willing to amend its membership criteria which we believe are discriminatory and unlawful.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission has a statutory duty to use our regulatory powers to enforce compliance with the law, so we have today issued county court proceedings against the BNP. However, the party still has an opportunity to resolve this quickly by giving the undertaking on its membership criteria that the Commission requires.&#8221;</p>

<p>Note: Contrary to popular belief, the BNP is not a &#8216;white&rsquo; party - instead supporting the interests of the <i>indigenous whites</i> of the British Isles.</p>
<p>Anyway, the easiest method to circumvent this attempted-destruction-by-litigation would be to allow non-whites entry to the party, on the grounds that they fully support all BNP policies - especially in regards to those relating to the various &#8216;indigenous British&rsquo; communities.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest: How many U.K. non-whites would be willing to support the BNP entirely on its own merits (the same defence used by the various &#8216;not-exclusive-towards-whites&rsquo; ethnic organisations in the U.K.: &#8220;We aren&rsquo;t discriminatory, whites are free to join the Sikh Lawyers Union/Black Firefighters Association/Chinese Police League but they just don&rsquo;t want to&#8221;) - as opposed to wanting entry in an attempt to reduce it to another raceless clone of the U.K.I.P?</p>

		<p>Americans need to establish a party like the BNP <br>
	</p>
<p>       Politicians and special interests are promoting massive immigration on both sides of the pond. The resulting cultural wars are diluting traditional European values. Under the guise of protecting racial minorities, government laws, programs, and practices discriminate against Europeans in hiring and promotion, in access to loans for business and housing, in college admission and scholarships, and in numerous other ways that affect our lives and livelihoods of Whites everywhere.<br>
	</p>
<p>God bless the common sense efforts of Nick Griffin and company.<br>

Congratulation to the BNP <br>

		<p>I can see why &#8220;white&#8221; would be a source of contention in the context that the BNP uses it. For example, to my knowledge, Eastern Europeans cannot join the BNP, whom many would consider to be &#8220;white&#8221; also.</p>

		<p>The Catholic church excludes Muslims and Mormons. The NBA discriminates against quadrapeligics. I can&rsquo;t join the local synagogue, because my mother wasn&rsquo;t Jewish. There&rsquo;s enough injustice in the world remaining to keep any commission busy. Do the British tax-payers actually pay government functionaries to monitor and restrict their choice of association?<br>

		<p>Why not make statements and have activities which will make non-whites uncomfortable. Talk a lot about black crime and low IQ. Say Nelson Mandella and Martin Luther King Jr. were no big deal. Emphasize traditional British heros, folklore, history, and art which is only white. Point out the incompatibility of Islam for Christian people. Talk a lot about immigration problems. Non-whites will get the message they are not wanted and also will find it unbearable to listen.</p>

<p>YES, YES, YES.  And it would expand the appeal of the BNP, by sending the message that it is different from the National Front or any other neo-nazi type outfit.  </p>
<p>Actually, I think that more than a handful of intelligent minorities would be smart enough not to want to see whites lose too much power, and would be willing to join the only party committed to that imperative.</p>

<p>The point is they would join and cause the party no end of trouble.  It would be mayhem.  There would be violence when &#8220;black&#8221; Brits didn&rsquo;t get their way in determining the parties platforms.  The whole point is the &#8220;Asians&#8221; and Africans&#8221; would join just to disrupt and destroy the party.</p>

		<p>The BNP is a &#8216;Nationalist&rsquo; party.<br>
Nationalism is the reverse to globalism and thus must be eliminated at all cost.</p>
<p>The globalists tend to eliminate opposition by subversion from within, the problem is that you cannot subvert the BNP from within, if you are not allowed to join.</p>
<p>This is why they are being taken to court.<br>
The BNP has become a serious threat. </p>

		<p>The BNP is perfectly legal, they describe the legal exemptions granted to ethnic political parties in several articles on their own website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that this is a politically motivated move that will do nothing but backfire, as it has no legal basis.  Then again, neither does the ban on BNP members being in the police force, but that still holds up somehow.</p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, the indigenous White population of Britain is destined to be reduced to minority tatus in its own homeland wuthin 40 years.<br>
 This is not an opinion but a mathematical fact based upon solid evidence.<br>
 It is the biggest existential threat that the indigenous population have ever faced in over 8000 years.<br>
 There is only one genuine democratic mass-movemen cognizant of this fact and aiming to reverse it by means of public education and dissemination of information and utimately by democratic poltical means.<br>
 Now, the intention of Britain&rsquo;s New Labour government is to destroy this sole effective opposition force.<br>
 The word &#8216;totalitarian&rsquo; springs to mind.</p>

		<p>During the apartheid era in South Africa, there was a legal definition of White, Black (Bantu), Coloured etc etc. I do not believe that there is any legal definition of one&rsquo;s race, including skin colour, in the UK. Even though a person may, to all intents and purposes, appear &#8216;Black&rsquo; to a beholder, there are degrees to this visual perception and the same applies to &#8216;White&rsquo; people. Lacking this legal definition which could be upheld in a court of law, I don&rsquo;t see how anyone can be racially classed by colour. I am a White person, anyone can see that, but if I was to challenge any group, body, political party or organisation to admit me into their ranks because I claim I am &#8216;Black&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t see how they could refute my claim. Therefore the BNP could, for example, state that their rules admitting &#8216;Whites&rsquo; only, could only be challenged by any &#8216;Black&rsquo; person being denied membership having produced some form of legally binding certification stating that they are indeed &#8216;Black&rsquo;. Talk about opening Pandora&rsquo;s Box!!</p>

		<p>I feel like these arguments could be handled so simply. Just say were a party for the indigenous folk of the island only. And the only way you can join if your not indigenous to the island is if you are indistinguishable from the indigenous population. Those will all be biologically European people naturally that can speak English. Cultural differences among whites like white jews and christians are not as acute and potentially hazardous as the cultural paradoxes with non-whites.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s true that some non-whites are perfectly aware of the injustices and persecution being inflicted on indigenous white inhabitants by the political and judicial machinations of their respective races.  However, they&rsquo;re also labouring under the notion that if white people cease to exist in their own ancestral homelands they, the non-white colonisers, are then free to hijack and steal every white homeland they&rsquo;ve been enabled to invade including the ancestral ones and instal their own rulers.</p>
<p>What they overlook is that, a deliberately engineered multiracial society which goes against nature will ensure that such a <i>society</i> will never be a nation.  Instead, it will be a perpetual war zone of competing invader races and sub-groups (tribes) that now occupying another ethnic group or group&rsquo;s once homogeneous territories, resorting to mass rape, slaughter and enslavement of one another on an intermittent but permanent basis.</p>
<p>Since so many races now occupy one living space and who rely on its natural and constructed resources, how many of these will eventually finish up being obliterated and/or enslaved?<br>

<p>The problem with this is that our political system isn&rsquo;t structured like Great Britain&rsquo;s.  They have a parlementary system.  If you reach a certain threashold (say 15%) your party can gain seats.  This leads to many parties, none having a majority of voters. </p>
<p>We have a &#8216;winner take all&rsquo; system.  This has inevitably led to two parties both trying to get to the all important majority of the electorate. </p>
<p>Thus what works in the UK will not work in the USA.  Our best bet remains remaking the GOP in our image.  Already the vast majority of GOP voters are white, and the vast majority of non-whites vote donkey party.   It will take a skilled politician to exploit this without going so far as to bring the media down with howls of &#8220;racist&#8221;.   </p>
<p>Ross Perot was the last big third party guy.  He got ZERO electoral votes despite getting nearly 15% of the popular vote. </p>
<p>The last third party candidate for President to get electoral votes was George Wallace in 1968.  He did run on an explicitly racial platform, but was soundly defeated by both the unpopular democrat incumbent, LBJ and the Republican, who won, Nixon. </p>

<p>You are incorrect here.  I think any church allows other church members to come in.  They hope to convert them to their sect.  I&rsquo;ve done it and in a potentially dangerous place.  I attended a Serbian Orthodox Service in former Yugoslavia during the Kosovo campaign.  I was welcomed by the priest and he allowed me to take photos of the remarkable painting inside the church itself.  He never asked me anything about what I believed.  I could have been a Muslim.  However, everyone knew I was an American.  I got a few curious looks, but no one glarred at me as if I were unwelcomed.  The young Bosnian Serb woman who had brought me, taught me all about their views.  I was simply curious to learn more of Serb views, including their religious culture.  As for Judaism, you are also incorrect.  Anyone can convert to Judaism.  One famous example is Sammy Davis Jr, the black singer and actor and member of the &#8220;notorious&#8221; &#8220;Rat Pack&#8221; that included Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  Judaism claims that if the mother is Jewish, the children are Jewish.  This is not a law, as far as I know, but a general attitude.  I gather that it developed in Europe during the medieval period due to the abuse of Jewish women by non-Jewish European males.  Judaism simply does not seek to convert and it does try to maintain its different ethnic groups in a more scriptual way than say the way a Hispanic heavy Catholic church does.  But the effect is the same. </p>

		<p>This sets up the confrontation that is inevitable in England as the last stand of the Indigenous White Britons seems to loom in the near future.  The government is pushing the issue to the point of combining the symbolic survival if the indigenous population with the actual survival of it.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown should have been arrested for his statement earlier this year regarding White Indiginous Britons, which was bigoted, racist statement and also rather exposed his governments intention to eliminate them through the old imperial method of breeding trouble makers out.  But such tactics went out with the rise of Parlement and democracy in England.  That would make Gordon Brown some sort of criminal, wouldn&rsquo;t it? </p>

So do we in our general elections,which makes it very hard for minor parties like the BNP to gain seats at Westminster.The 15% threshold only applies in the European parliamentary elections which do indeed operate on a system of proportional representation.This perhaps gives a misleading impression of the the BNPs electoral prospects in a UK general election. </p>
