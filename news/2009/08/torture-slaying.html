<h1>Torture-Slaying Trial, Day 8: Cobbins Guilty; Jurors to Consider Death Penalty</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville (Tennessee) News Sentinel, August 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Jurors this morning convicted Letalvis Cobbins of first-degree murder in the torture-slaying of Knox County couple Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom.</p>
<p>The verdicts, after being reviewed by Criminal Court Judge Richard Baumgartner, were announced before a packed courtroom.</p>
<p>Jurors on Wednesday will shift into a penalty phase in which they will consider evidence about whether Cobbins, 26, of Kentucky, should be executed for the January 2007 kidnapping and murders.</p>
<p>The jury concluded that Cobbins had responsibility in all the crimes committed against Christian, however, the same panel acquitted Cobbins of charges involving the rape of Newsom.</p>
<p>Those acquittals don&rsquo;t mean much, however, since jurors found him guilty of the first-degree murder of Christian, 21, and Newsom, 23.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Surprisingly, just before the verdicts were announced, the Knox County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office cleared a bench in the courtroom and escorted some half-dozen women and a baby into the courtroom to fill that bench.</p>
<p>They wept as the verdict was announced, and Cobbins repeatedly looked in their direction. However, it&rsquo;s still not clear what their relationship to Cobbins is as deputies quickly hustled them out of the courtroom and building before the jury had even left.</p>
<p>Cobbins was dry-eyed as the verdicts were read to a silent courtroom.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cobbins has admitted raping Christian inside the house, although he testified Saturday that she offered him the oral sex if he could help ensure her freedom. Christian and Newsom did not know Cobbins, Davidson, 28, or their co-defendants, George Thomas, 26, and Vanessa Coleman, 21, who await trial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the death-penalty phase Wednesday, prosecutors Fitzgerald and Price will try to show Cobbins&rsquo; crimes are so heinous he deserves death, while defense attorneys Green and Parton will try to counter with mitigating facts.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this.  It&rsquo;s more likely that he asked her for oral sex to gain freedom.  Blacks are pathological liars;  murderous blacks more so.</p>

		<p>The acquittal on the rape charges seems absurd. Even if you take his claim that she &#8220;offered&#8221; the sex in exchange for being released, it was still under duress. Saying that she wasn&rsquo;t raped is like saying that the Twin Towers 9/11 victims who jumped to their deaths committed suicide and were not victims of the mass homicide. </p>
<p>Is there a lawyer on this board who knows whether or not the rape acquittal means that the sex can not be considered as an aggravating factor during death penalty consideration?</p>

		<p>It seems to me that no one really expects blacks to take  responsibility for their actions.  No one expects them to behave like other humans.  Many people, including blacks themselves, tend to view black violence as a kind of force of nature, malevolent but random with regards to its victim.  Like lightening or snake bite or disease, it doesn&rsquo;t care who it destroys. Blacks &amp; other races are brutalized more or less equally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that this story got so little press coverage, &amp; that people seem uninterested even when you tell them about it.  Seems it&rsquo;s &#8220;dog bites man&#8221; instead of the other way around.</p>

		<p>I have trouble even imagining the horrors that these two young people went through before they died. As has been stated numerous times before, if the races of the victims and the perpetrators were reversed, can anyone even imagine the degree of national outrage which would result from day and night media coverage? I don&rsquo;t really have anything else to comment since words alone can&rsquo;t do justice to my feelings about this case. I only hope that those of us aware of this will recommit ourselves to the struggle to create a world in which never again will such a horrendous event as this be able to occur.</p>

		<p>Watching the video, what makes me sick is the face of Jamie Satterfield. This is the same fool who tried to downplay this racially motivated torture and murder as a &#8216;fatal carjacking&rsquo; when this story first broke. In an interview with national media, Satterfield only had harsh words for the &#8216;racists&rsquo; who were demanding she call the crime what it actually was. Satterfield was dragged kicking and screaming finally into calling it a torture slaying long after it was obvious to everybody else who got work of it.</p>
<p>Now looking at this dead soul relating the true brutality of the murders on camera, I wonder if she is traumatized by what happened to Christian and Newsome, if she is traumatized by having to relay the sordid details of black savagery to those &#8216;racists&rsquo; who were right all along, or if she is merely traumatized by the fact that the people for whom she is really a staunch advocate - and for whom she will lie through her teeth in her journalism - are headed to prison.</p>
<p>Satterfield and her ilk in the press are enablers for the likes of Letalvis Cobbins.</p>

		<p>The  Christian and Newsome families know what they need to do. The blood of Channon and Christopher cries out for vengeance. The lawyers will make deals and agree to pleas in order to cut down on court time and expense at the expense of true justice. What is happening here in the US is the same thing that&rsquo;s happening in Zimbabwe and South Africa except that in those countries the government sanctions it whereas here the government and justice system just stands by and lets it happen because they have been rendered impotent to deal with it. The jury will either not be able to reach a verdict or they will nullify the charges.<br>
I know that this will never be posted because it somehow violates AMREN&rsquo;s policy not to be offensive or threatening. This is why this Dirty War against White people will go on until there is a conflagration the lieks of which hasn&rsquo;t been seen in this country since 1862. AMREN is fighting with one hand tied behind its back. </p>

		<p> &hellip;&#8221;he testified Saturday that she offered him the oral sex if he could help ensure her freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>To me, this is the equivalent of what Richard Allen Davis said at the time of his verdict in the trial where he was accused of the murder of Polly Klass.  As her father, Mark Klass stood in the gallery, he said that Polly had begged him to go ahead and strangle her, but just not repeat the anal sexual assault that she was used to from her father.  Cobbins want to imply that Channon Christian was secretly attracted to him and would have been a willing sexual partner in a normal situation.  He also makes it appear that Channon Christian had no real feelings for Christopher Newsom, or that her attraction to him superceded it, and that all of this made it easy for her to let him die while she walked away.  He further implies that sexual favors were available to him because Channon Christian was a white trash slut.</p>
<p>What a sad day when gentlemen may no longer take proper action against the maligning of their women!</p>
<p>The death penalty isn&rsquo;t enough for cases like this one.</p>

Yes, you hit the nail on the head. With black violence, particularly black on white violence, it is always &#8220;random&#8221;, like a bolt of lightning from the heavens on a clear blue day or the random onset of cancer in a young person&rsquo;s body.  </p>
<p>Nobody knows why it happens, and nobody is to blame! If you absolutely must probe for an underlying cause, its best to just say &#8220;the system failed&#8221; the little glock packing rapscallion or maybe the victim &#8220;looked at&#8221; him or even &#8220;used the n-word(!)&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>If you try to ascribe ration animus as a motivation it will always be claimed the upstanding fella had &#8220;white friends&#8221; and even dated &#8220;white women!&#8221; and of course it goes without saying anyone trying to make the case for hate crimes against a black youth is infallibly labeled a racist themselves!</p>
<p>Also this refusal to accept the consequence for one&rsquo;s actions does not just apply to violence but a whole panoply of social dysfunctions, the number one being the non stop manufacturing of illegitimate broodlings, but also more mundane matters like becoming massively obese, or the inability balance a checkbook. </p>

<p>He was acquitted only of the rape of NEWSOM, who was the boyfriend, even at a murder trial you got to keep it on the &#8220;down low&#8221; you know? Confessing to a dozen murders is no big deal. Confessing to Sodomy? Not in a bizillion years.</p>

		<p>What does this Knoxville crime &mdash; horrible enough without the unsubstantiated elaborations &mdash; tell us about race and crime in America? As noted above, if the races had been reversed, this would have been a media extravaganza on the scale of Rodney King or James Byrd Jr. Second, the police would have laid all their cards on the table, and the press would have savored every lurid detail. Can we all say double standard? Newspapers still refuse  to publish the  race of  a black perpetrator. </p>

		<p>Cobbins wasn&rsquo;t acquitted for the rape of Channon Christian. He was acquitted for the rape of Christopher Newsom. And since there didn&rsquo;t seen to be any DNA traces that tied him to the rape of that young man,I don&rsquo;t really have a problem with that. </p>
<p>In fact,it&rsquo;s possible (rank speculation here on my part) that the jury went ahead and acquitted him on the Newsom rape charges in order to shut off a possible avenue for appeal. If that&rsquo;s what happened,again,no problem from me. He was convicted on all other counts.</p>

		<p>How DARE this savage beast say Christian &#8220;offered&#8221; him oral sex in exchange for her release, as if that makes it ok. IF it&rsquo;s true, then this poor young woman was no doubt desperately trying to save herself and begging for her life, but to this filthy, twisted piece of trash, it was an &#8220;offer&#8221;.</p>
<p>God Bless her family for having to sit thru the details of this horrific torture of their daughter. I would have lost my mind by now. </p>

		<p>Chris N,<br>
I&rsquo;ve been following this case from the beginning so I wanted to clear this up. He was found guilty of the rape of the girl, Channon Christian, but found not guilty of raping her boyfriend, Chris Newsome. He had denied raping Channon until his DNA was found on her(despite them pouring bleach in her mouth). Thats when he came up with the &#8220;she offered me oral sex&#8221; defense. Chris Newsome was raped with an object therefore there was no DNA found on him and the prosecution had a tough time putting that charge on him. As far as the death penalty is concerned it will be tough because the jury is made up of 6 blacks, 5 whites, and 1 Asian. The defendants brother Lamarcus Davidson will most likely be charged with the rape of Chris Newsome. He is also believed to be the ringleader in this terrible crime and much more likely to get the death penalty. His trial begins this week. </p>

		<p>It was early 2007 when this crime happened.  About this time, broadcaster Don Imus was castigated for the &#8216;crime against blacks&rsquo; of calling the Rutger Womens basketball team an unflattering name.</p>
<p>While all the major news reported on Mr. Imus, most joined a conspiracy of silence about the events in Knoxville.</p>

		<p>Just compare this heinous crime with the original and recent anniversary media fuss over the Manson Family killings. This is about as gruesome as they come, but the MSM about sweeps this under the rug. Seems when Blacks kill anybody, it is no big deal, especially when the victims are White. One day there might be a backlash against this sort of thing, but only by the Whites that have any backbone left, if there are any of them left.</p>

		<p>A year or so ago I was listening to a local talk show host who grew up and is from that region of Tenn. He said that he called old friends in the news buisness around there, and that they were given strict orders not to talk about or print anything about that case.<br>
This is an all out cover up. Outside of that region not one in a hundred people know about it.That is why I try to look at Amren everyday.</p>

		<p>I just happened to catch this on live video yesterday.  Shannon&rsquo;s father was rocking back and forth and you could see the muscles in his neck bulging like he was doing everything he could to stay put.   I also watched some of the video of the coroner&rsquo;s report and it was so hard to hear, even without the forensic photos that she WAS showing in the courtroom.  If it were MY daughter, there would be NO QUARTER.  I would kill every last family member of all the perps,.. every last ONE,.. NO QUARTER.  I would probably save someone else from their criminal behavior.  These &#8220;people&#8221; breed these monsters and then turn them loose on society.  Shannon&rsquo;s father refers to them as &#8220;animals&#8221;.  Animals don&rsquo;t do these things,. monsters do.  This idiot thought he was going to talk his way out of it,. and he let out that he was alone in the house with her for over an hour.   He could have SET HER FREE,.. but he didn&rsquo;t.  And I was happy to see that FINALLY, blacks on the jury didn&rsquo;t vote color.  One down, THREE to go.</p>

		<p>No media coverage of this at all. It doesn&rsquo;t give the media a reason to &#8220;prove&#8221; that all Whites are racist, so it&rsquo;s spiked. It will never be on the local news or on CNN.<br>

		<p>This is a win for Channon and Christopher and their families.  </p>
<p>But as I said, the death penalty in Tennessee is a joke and if these guys get life, they will be welcomed with open arms from all the other lowlife creeps in prison.  These guys will be treated like heroes.  </p>

		<p>This is sad. Very sad.</p>
<p>Today I read an article about 2 white teens who beat a central American immigrant and stole his wallet on Long Island. That is charged as a hate crime even though there was theft, yet this horrible crime which regardless of how it started turned into a hate crime was deemed not a hate crime because of the theft of the car? A car which was abandoned pretty much untouched a few blocks from that house of horrors.</p>
<p>Hate crime legislation is simply a hate crime towards whites. Even more specifically it is a hate crime towards white, heterosexual, Christian men. What happened to Channon was a hate crime but if Christian had not also been a victim the womens rights groups would be all over this as being a hate crime as well. I am sure Christian being there made them ignore Channon&rsquo;s rape and murder.</p>
<p>I have never hated another human being because of race but legislation like the hate crime bill, VAWA, affirmative action and the like pushes me everyday closer to a pro-white mentality. I had always hoped we could all live in a world of fairness and equality but now all I see is a world of focused hate towards white men. Focused, made legal and promoted by every group NOT a white man, even a large portion of white women.</p>
<p>I will remember this case and the double standard it exposes for the rest of my life. It has made my path for the future clear.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Is there a lawyer on this board who knows whether or not the rape acquittal means that the sex can not be considered as an aggravating factor during death penalty consideration?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no clear answer yet.  The SCOTUS implied that proof beyond a reasonable doubt would probably NOT BE REQUIRED for aggravating factors in death penalty cases in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000).  Therefore, if the jury was persuaded at least by a preponderance of the evidence that he was guilty of rape, they could use it as an aggravating factor even though he was acquitted on that count.  </p>
<p>But since the issue was not before the Court, this is just dicta and would not be controlling precedent.  It would definitely be safer to rely on other aggravating factors, like torture.  As of right now, I don&rsquo;t know enough about the case to know what other aggravating factors might apply.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re wrong about that.  Feminism has been coopted by just about every politically correct cause in the world, EXCEPT standing up for women.  Feminist outrage is conspicuously absent when white women are brutalized by non-white men.</p>

		<p>I live in Knoxville tn. and this is a sad day. The sentence for the kidnapping,torture,murder. of these kids was just prison time. Apparently this man had a hard child hood because his aunt raised him instead of his mother. So I can only assume that his brother,having the same mother and being raised by the aunt,had an unhappy child hood as well. We in Knoxville now know what that means.I am referring to channon christian and chris newsom. Satan really does have domain on planet earth. Did notice the joy on ghettobragginrights, as a matter of a fact they state he is crowned.</p>

		<p>I live in Knoxville and have watched this unfold since it happened and I can tell you I have never heard of such savagery that they exhibited toward this young couple.  Yes, we are outraged at the travesty in this crime.  No news channel wanted to touch it but I guarantee you if the shoe had been on the other foot we would have had all the black &#8220;civil rights&#8221; groups crawling like cock roaches!<br>
Matthew Shepard was covered extensively&hellip;the Duke lacrosse team was covered only because a black stripper decided she wanted to accuse the young guys of raping her.  Which turned out to be a lie.  To see Nancy Grace beat her chest and wail about the injustice of what these white guys did to this black person&hellip;I just want to PUKE! I could go on and on but you get the drift. May something like this visit the people who ignored this horrific case and then we can turn them off!<br>
The jury came back with a LWOP verdict instead of the DP in the Cobbins case.  Why, I don&rsquo;t know because if ever the DP was needed it was for these five black people!  The crime was so horrific and sadistic that Cobbins should have received death.  I just don&rsquo;t understand bleeding hearts&hellip;they make me sick.<br>
Pray for the Christian and Newsom families because they desperately need it.</p>

		<p>Cobbins has been sentenced to life in prison without parole&hellip;.a lifetime permit to continue raping whites in prison.</p>
<p>Lefty organization Human Rights Watch&rsquo;s report on rape in prisons finds black on white rape to be the predominant form of prison rape:</p>
<p>&#8220;Past studies have documented the prevalence of black on white sexual aggression in prison.(213) These findings are further confirmed by Human Rights Watch&rsquo;s own research. Overall, our correspondence and interviews with white, black, and Hispanic inmates convince us that white inmates are disproportionately targeted for abuse.(214) Although many whites reported being raped by white inmates, black on white abuse appears to be more common. To a much lesser extent, non-Hispanic whites also reported being victimized by Hispanic inmates&hellip;Other than sexual abuse of white inmates by African Americans, and, less frequently, Hispanics, interracial and interethnic sexual abuse appears to be much less common than sexual abuse committed by persons of one race or ethnicity against members of that same group.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Newspapers still refuse to publish the race of a black perpetrator&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw no coverage of this case here in California.  If it were not for the Internet, very few of us would know about this atrocity directed at Whites. The msm are evil for not covering this case as they would if the situation were reversed.</p>
<p>Here in Los Angeles, a beautiful 17-year old woman named Lily Burk was recently murdered brutally by what was reported as &#8216;a homeless man.&rsquo;  NO picture was ever published, no mention of the murderer&rsquo;s race anywhere  &mdash;  although Lily&rsquo;s photo accompanied every news article.  She was an only child whose parents were about to take her to look at colleges before she started her senior year of high school.  Her parents were so distraught, they couldn&rsquo;t leave their home and spoke only through their attorney.</p>
<p>Finally, after I spent a long time searing the Internet, I found a picture of the murderer who, of course, was black.  Yeah, another vicious black criminal given a pass by the msm.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;This is a win for Channon and Christopher and their families..&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, Gayle, there is no win here. No redress will ever be enough and I doubt the sub-humans who did this feel one iota of remorse.</p>
<p>As the mother of a beautiful 18-year old it pains me deeply when I imagine the agony the families were forced to endure during the trial.  I would probably end up heavily drugged in a psychiatric hospital, probably for life.</p>
<p>There is only justice as described by Buffalogal:</p>
<p>&#8221;..If it were MY daughter, there would be NO QUARTER. I would kill every last family member of all the perps,.. every last ONE,.. NO QUARTER&hellip;. These &#8216;people&rsquo; breed these monsters and then turn them loose on society&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Buffalogal is correct when she writes that every last family member should be eliminated  &mdash;  the only thing these sub-humans understand is immediate, brutal, savage justice administered without mercy, with extreme prejudice.</p>

 I couldn&rsquo;t possibly agree more. And I note that these people are all prolific breeders. They all have children! (just look at that story of the woman in Phoenix who dismembered the man in the wheelchair. She didn&rsquo;t want &#8220;snitches&#8221; around her children, but murderers are OK). They should be extirpated entirely, root and branch, every last one. Otherwise, even with the death penalty given to one of them, there will be more in the next generation to do the same things all over again. Some cultures DO punish the entire family that produced such a monster, and we should do the same.</p>
