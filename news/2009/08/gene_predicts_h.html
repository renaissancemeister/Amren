<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32438430/ns/health-infectious_diseases/">Gene Predicts Hepatitis Treatment Success</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, August 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Scientists say they&rsquo;ve found a big reason why treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection works better for white patients than for African-Americans. It&rsquo;s a tiny variation in a gene.</p>
<p>People with a certain gene variant are far more likely to respond to treatment, and that variant is more common in people with European ancestry than African-Americans, researchers report.</p>
<p>In fact, that probably explains about half the racial disparity in treatment response, the scientists estimate in a study published online Sunday by the journal Nature.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African-Americans who had the gene variant showed a better response rate than whites who didn&rsquo;t have it, indicating that the gene is a better predictor than ethnicity, the researchers said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An estimated 170 million people around the world and perhaps 3.2 million people in the United States alone have a chronic hepatitis C infection. That puts them at risk for developing liver cirrhosis and cancer. The virus is spread by contact with infected blood, such as from using inadequately sterilized needles.<br/>

		<p>Some idiotic blacks nevertheless will claim that hospitals let blacks die because of racist attitudes. Anytime whites come out better than blacks, the racism word is dragged out. Blacks were dealt a bad hand by Mother Nature, starting with IQ and going on with genetic diseases. Being rather ignorant of other races&rsquo; problems, it does not occur to blacks that other races have some genetic diseases as well. One must conclude that this is not only an ignorant race, but a self-absorbed race. Yuck.</p>

<p>Correct, anytime nature works against them, they will always find away to blame whites, or racism. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is a genetic disease, or a natural disaster. Following hurricane Katrina, many accused the Government of tampering with the levees, and even more ridiculously of changing the weather, and directing the storm toward New Orleans. They love their conspiracy theories like no other. Whites engineered AIDS in a lab, then distributed it in Africa, to kill off unsuspecting black people. Of course, they fail to notice that it has been white westerners who have kept half of the continent population from succumbing to famine, droughts, and disease, for decades now. Yes, they will blame racist white scientists for coming up with a treatment which is more effective on whites than blacks. Of course, should these same black patients receive a liver transplant later, few blacks will ever consider the fact that, in all likelihood, it probably was from a white donor, rather than a black one, and they will also have a greater chance of rejecting it. Because whites doctors knowingly gave them the wrong liver? No, only because blacks seldom ever donate their organs.</p>

<p>I suspect, the Afro-Americans who do have the gene, inherited it from a long forgotten white ancestor or two.   Likewise, the whites who haven&rsquo;t got it are probably not even true whites, but of mixed race origin further back in their family trees.</p>
