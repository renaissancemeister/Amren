<h1>Census Count May Alter La. Congressional Districts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Largen, New Star (Monroe, Louisiana), August 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shreveport demographer Elliott Stonecipher is warning that if the U.S. Census Bureau counts non-citizens in the 2010 census for apportionment purposes, Louisiana and the Delta could be big losers.</p>
<p>Stonecipher, who co-wrote an editorial in part dedicated to explaining the Pelican State&rsquo;s plight in Sunday&rsquo;s The Wall Street Journal, said Wednesday that the Census Bureau is set to count illegal residents in the same way as legal residents, and doing so could cost the state one of it&rsquo;s seven congressional seats  &mdash;  most likely in north Louisiana.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stonecipher and LSU constitutional law professor John Baker argued in their editorial that non-citizens should be counted separately according to the Constitution, and states should not get additional House seats that they don&rsquo;t deserve.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau interprets the Constitution differently.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stonecipher warns that the majority-African American 2nd Congressional District could also be altered during the 2011 redistricting, which will be finalized by the Louisiana Legislature next year following the Census.</p>

		<p>Speaking of Louisiana congressional districts, the Stupid Party is making a big deal out of Anh &#8220;Joseph&#8221; Cao, replaced William &#8220;Cold Cash&#8221; Jefferson.  They&rsquo;re babbling on about how he&rsquo;s the future of the Stupid Party, but he&rsquo;s not even the future of his own district.  Cao is the Republican the represents the strongest Democrat district in the Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI), that district has the second highest possible Democrat rating.  The blacks will circle the wagons in 2010.</p>

		<p>When the acorn (oops, I mean &ldquo;census&rdquo; worker) comes to the door, ask for identification. (driver&rsquo;s license, NOT the census ID). You will need it for the police report that you will file after your house is broken into. Some of the questions such as &ldquo;what time do you leave for work?&rdquo; and &ldquo;how many hours do you work per day?&rdquo; can (and will) be used by acorn census workers to &ldquo;case&rdquo; your residence and will be seen as an opportunity to take whatever they want to fulfill their sense of &ldquo;social justice&rdquo;. I plan on asking for ID, writing everything down, and then telling them to leave (without answering any questions) since I cannot verify their identity.<br/>
Another way to &ldquo;make things right&rdquo; is to &ldquo;skew&rdquo; the census (if you choose to &ldquo;cooperate&rdquo; and answer questions). The only question that is legally required to be answered is the one concerning &ldquo;how many people live at this residence?&rdquo; Be creative. You should have at least SIX people living with you.<br/>
acorn skewed the election with graveyard voters and multiple fraudulent voter registrations. Let&rsquo;s &ldquo;adjust&rdquo; the census.<br/>
