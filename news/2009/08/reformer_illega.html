<h1>Reformer: Illegal Immigrants Cost Pa. Taxpayers $728 Million Yearly</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Craig Smith, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, August 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Illegal immigrants are costing Pennsylvania taxpayers about $728 million a year for education, medical care and incarceration, the head of a national immigration reform group said Thursday.</p>
<p>The annual fiscal burden amounts to about $150 per Pennsylvania household headed by a native-born resident, said Dan Stein, president of the Federation of American Immigration Reform, or FAIR.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Costs could go even higher under the Obama administration&rsquo;s massive health care overhaul, Stein said. The plan contains loopholes that will allow illegal immigrants to receive taxpayer-funded benefits, he said.</p>
<p>About 1.1 million legal immigrants enter the United States each year, said John L. Martin, FAIR&rsquo;s director of special projects and author of a new report on the cost to the state of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The report estimated that Pennsylvanians spend about $660 million a year on education for an estimated 48,500 children of illegal aliens, which includes about $150 million for special English instruction to an estimated 34,200 children.</p>
<p>Taxpayer-funded, unreimbursed medical expenses for health care provided to illegal aliens in Pennsylvania are about $50 million a year, and it costs more than $17.5 million a year to incarcerate illegal aliens in state, county and independent city prisons in Pennsylvania, the report said.</p>
<p>The state has a rapidly growing illegal alien population of about 140,000, nearly tripling since 2000, FAIR said. Between 2000 and 2008, the state&rsquo;s foreign-born population grew by 34.5 percent while its native-born population decreased by 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stein said immigration caps will help maintain a stable flow of highly trained, highly skilled workers and allow the country to better manage its growth.<br>

		<p>There must be some mistake here? They Only Come To Work? Surely they wouldn&rsquo;t bleed a system they haven&rsquo;t paid a penny for, or should I say peso ?</p>

		<p>They must have made some sort of mistake.  The media told us over and over again last year that there was no reason to vote for Lou Barletta for Congress, because immigration didn&rsquo;t affect PA that much.</p>

		<p>The reason I think that most Americans can&rsquo;t grasp the significance of illegal immigration in their own lives is because it is an issue with so many tentacles. It affects wages, it affects crime, it affects social services, it affects American culture. In each of these areas it infiltrates, ever so gradually and effects its corrupting influence on Americans traditional way of life. Unfortunately, so many Americans still cannot see this, and might not be able to do a thing about it in a few more years. It would be a big fight taking on the ethnic interest groups, chambers of commerce, corrupt politicians, and various church groups. But as shown by the Town Hall Meetings, Americans could do it, if they really became motivated to do so. </p>

		<p>Note however that corporate scofflaws and their enablers, aptly named the &#8220;Treason Lobby&#8221; by VDare, are really letting the horse manure fly in order to counter stories like this which accord with ordinary Americans&rsquo; perceptions of the costs of immigration.<p>In a report released the other day by the pseudo-&#8220;libertarian&#8221; Cato Institute, the grotesque claim was made that an amnesty of illegals would yield a &#8220;net benefit&#8221; of $180 BILLION whereas enforcement of the law would cost $80 billion. http://tinyurl.com/r8owau Supposedly according to this &#8220;study,&#8221; an amnesty &#8220;would increase the productivity of immigrant workers and create more job openings for American workers in higher-skilled occupations,&#8221; while enforcement will &#8220;shrink the overall economy.&#8221;  It is a moral atrocity that these &#8220;think tanks&#8221; get money to churn out this garbage.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again as I said it before.  Illegal drugs, illegal parking, illegal immigrant.  The key word in all those things is illegal!</p>

		<p>Where is the money going to come from to keep underwriting these illegals?  We are not in an upswing economically.  We are in remission and these periods will briefly occur over the next year or two, but nothing is going to stop the economic plummet in the long run.   </p>
<p>It will be interesting to see each of the states trying to balance their budgets until the collapse comes, and it will be particularly entertaining if we will be able to observe the multicults at each other&rsquo;s throats over their desire for unchecked legal and illegal immigration, when they&rsquo;re facing near-bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s unemployment is now at 11-1/2% (Officially)but there are really millions more not working for one reason or another.  California is another populous state in BIG trouble.  Many will be falling by the way as we get further into this depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get ugly.  Those of us who own property will be hit to the max with property taxes as the states lose more revenue.  More traffic tickets will be written to bring in revenue.  Already many states are increasing taxes on everything that is already taxed and will be creating new ones.  Look for services to be taxed.  Some states will try to get an income tax if they don&rsquo;t already have one, and those who do will force an increase.</p>
<p>The number of jobless citizens will be increased, and, as they do now, the bureaucrats will try accounting tricks to make the economic picture look better than what it really is, but it won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>At some point the tea partiers will control the streets, clashing with Acorn, the SEIU and other unions and Obama supporters, and because the tea party numbers will be tremendously greater the opposition will not fare too well.</p>
<p>It will be at this point that things will go downhill even more rapidly.</p>
<p>And so far as illegal aliens are concerned, I&rsquo;m pretty sure blacks will be fighting with a large portion of Hispanics over jobs and benefits.</p>
<p>The other show will drop in the residential and commercial real estate markets in just a few months.  We might ewven have an October surprise this year that not even the experts have anticipated.  If so, look for things to deteriorate much quicker.</p>

I was watching c-spans&rsquo; Washington Journal. They had a woman from some organization advocating amnesty and increasing the number of immigrants.</p>
<p>She said that even though we&rsquo;re in a recession, we need more immigrants to come and be here when the economy turns around.</p>
<p>These people are desperate to come up with any and every justification for their insanity.</p>
