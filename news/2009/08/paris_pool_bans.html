			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Breitbart, August 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The pool ban came as French lawmakers conduct hearings on whether to ban the burqa after President Nicolas Sarkozy said the head-to-toe veil was &#8220;not welcome&#8221; in secular France.</p>
<p>Officials in the Paris suburb of Emerainville said they let the woman swim in the pool in July wearing the &#8220;burqini,&#8221; designed for Muslim women who want to swim without revealing their bodies.</p>
<p>But when she returned in August they decided to apply hygiene rules and told her she could not swim if she insisted on wearing the garment, which resembles a wetsuit with built-in hood.</p>
<p>Pool staff &#8220;reminded her of the rules that apply in all (public) swimming pools which forbid swimming while clothed,&#8221; said Daniel Guillaume, an official with the pool management.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The newspaper ran a photo of the woman sporting her three-piece &#8220;burqini&#8221; which she said she purchased in Dubai during a recent holiday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Local mayor Alain Kelyor said &#8220;all this has nothing to do with Islam,&#8221; adding that the &#8220;burqini&#8221; was &#8220;not an Islamic swimsuit, that type of suit does not exist in the Koran,&#8221; the Muslim holy book.</p>
<p>France, home to Europe&rsquo;s biggest Muslim minority, has set up a special panel of 32 lawmakers to consider whether a law should be enacted to bar Muslim women from wearing the full veil, known as a burqa or niqab.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The burqa debate in France has drawn chilling warnings from Al-Qaeda that it was ready to &#8220;take revenge for the honour of our daughters and sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Communist MP Andre Gerin, who heads the National Assembly&rsquo;s burqa commission, called the &#8220;burqini&#8221; ridiculous and said pool administrators were right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t allow this. This is proof that there is a political agenda behind such dress,&#8221; Gerin told Le Parisien.</p>

Strange looking indeed, but what does he mean, not an Islamic swimsuit? Full burkas seem better suited for sinking, rather than swimming, one reason I find it so strange so many of them appear at public pools, unless it is just to start a lawsuit.</p>

		<p>The burqini is not &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; to anyone who&rsquo;s had melanoma and still wants to swim outdoors.  (If you think melanoma is an old-man&rsquo;s, John McCain disease, note that the wife of one of our Red Sox ballplayers had almost 30 melanomas removed from her back when she was a fun-in-sun young woman.  It&rsquo;s also a very sneaky disease  &mdash;  will show no signs of existence for decades and then return with a vengeance.  If you don&rsquo;t like black skin, note that terminal melanoma turns you black all over a few days before you die.)</p>
<p>Any knee-jerk anti-diversity people should take note of where diversity turns positive, as economic diversity.  Would the burqini exist (be profitable to be designed and manufactured) if not for Muslim girls/women wanting to swim in public?</p>
<p>The Muslim burqini seems more swim-friendly than the Wholesome Wear Christian suits (how would one do a frog kick in the snapped-up skirt?).  The Wholesome Wear suits could be useful for anyone wanting to get one&rsquo;s feet wet and then rush off to a nice dinner with no time to change clothes.  </p>

		<p>I have personal experience with French laws regarding public bathing places.  While living in Europe in the late 90s, we vacationed in Southern France in 1998.  They have wonderful campgrounds, most of them with swimming facilities.  Men must wear a speedo or not allowed to swim.  I was offered a &#8220;lend out&#8221; speedo in order to comply with the law.  Wearing someone elses speedo, or in this case many other men&rsquo;s speedo is a bit creepy to me.  The reason is that anything more, like the trunks, even minimal ones like I had with me, are considered a non-swimming piece of apparel and since you have lounged in it all day, you cannot use it in a pool.  However, as we all know, women lounge about in bikinis all day and then go swimming.  The law is aimed at reducing communicable diseases, but ends up discriminating against men.  We moved on to a lake campsite and swam in that with my own trunks on.</p>

		<p>Shortly after moving into a house with a pool, I turned into the mean Mr. Carver from my childhood. The old man would spray a garden hose at the feet of neighborhood kids knocking them down  when they  tried to  enter his backyard pool without showering first. <br>
 It was after  I looked at my pool service brochure and it calculated the cost in dollars for chlorine adjustment to compensate for people who jumped in fully clothed or covered in sweat. I`m thinking that neither the garment or the girl underneth has been fully rinsed off before entering the pool. I don`t believe that one of these pool &#8220;pilgrims&#8221; strips naked, showers and then redresses if they are so shy to begin with. </p>

		<p>I would not want to swim with someone who felt that they had to wear such a suit. I would think that it would be impossible to shower before swimming and it would really be unhygenic. I know that there are modest Christian women or Orthodox Jewish women who would wear a longer swimsuit, there are actually companies that make them, but they are nothing like the burkini and they actually look like swimsuits. As long as the suit was made for the pool and would not be a drowning or hygene risk (the burkini is defninately both) there should not be a problem with what the suit looks like. </p>

And still no outrage from the feminist regarding burqas in western nations.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s ok so long as Muslim women cooperate in their own subjugation and it&rsquo;s not imposed on them by White, western, patriarchal mores. That, of course, is wrong.</p>
<p>If I live long enough, I might even get to see the feminists being executed for not wearing burqas. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s b/c on the left, race trumps their pet causes even within organizations that are supposedly devoted to the pet cause in question.  The Sierra Club can&rsquo;t be counted on to pass a resolution against mass immigration, even though its effects on the environment are obvious.  Feminists don&rsquo;t say boo about Muslim misogyny.  And there was an article this weekend in the New York Times, where its chief sports writer echoed Jesse Jackson and said that NFL owners were engaging in a racist cabal in not signing Michael Vick, because not signing him would be like not letting Jackie Robinson into baseball.  It&rsquo;s stupid, yes, but I think it&rsquo;s a full court press on the part of the media and Vick allies to neutralize PETA, and to keep their protests at the stadium where Vick might play to a minimum.  </p>

<p>A two year old could shoot that one down. All you have to do is ask the question, &#8216;Did Mr. Robinson lynch, torture, and hang dogs by the neck as they writhed in pain and terror until they were dead?&rsquo; If they answer no, and one would hope they would answer no, ask them &#8216;which of the two honorably represent their sport?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And yes I understand and agree with your comment on feminists and other liberal groups. I supposed I should preface some of my remarks with *sarcastic disdain*. When it comes to Muslims and feminists, feminists tick me off. That they don&rsquo;t speak up speaks volumes as to their motives.<br>

		<p>At the local pool, they asked people for ideas. I proposed that we mandate co-ed nude swimming to keep the moslems out. They were shocked, but said that enough moslems start using the pool, they would consider this. </p>

<p>Your commentary sounds decidingly subversive in nature. Who is kidding who? These swimsuits are not designed to ward off skin disease. And your rather snide remarks directed and &#8220;wholesome Christian wear&#8221; says it all.</p>

		<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t fashion at the pool. It&rsquo;s how so many intruders swamped France so that stories like this now are common. France had a homogeneous population and customs; a long history of great accomplishments in war, culture and daily living as an elegant exercise. Islam is utterly opposite to Frnnch values-both secular and religious. These strange women should be not only out of the pool, they should be back in North Africa.</p>

<p><br>
There is actually a company called &#8220;Wholesome Wear&#8221; that makes swimsuits designed for women who do not want to wear the styles of swimsuits that are commercially availible. They look somewhat like a body suit with short legs with a jumper or pinafore type dress over the top. The suits have short sleeves and are about knee length so nothing like the burqini.http://www.wholesomewear.com/page-4.html gives a good example of what they look like. </p>
<p>I would not think that the girls and women who would wear a suit like this would be swimming in a public pool but that is just my opinion. Incidentally there are also companies that make swim suits that are designed for sun protection, but again, nothing like the burqini, they seem to be a sort of tight shirt and shorts. </p>

<p>&#8220;Wholesome Wear&#8221; is the name of a company that manufactures a bathing outfit targeted at ultraconservative Christian women in the US.  The outfits are of a slick synthetic material and have an elbow-length fitted top and just-below-knee tights, much like fashionable modern dancewear, with an attached jumper on top.  The jumper skirt snaps between the legs for swimming.  See one of the links at the bottom of the main article  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s a picture.  The word &#8220;wholesome&#8221; was the company&rsquo;s, not my own judgment.  </p>
<p>I live in a coastal city and sometimes go to the beach in street clothes, to cool off sore feet.  Too troublesome to lug along bathing clothes-and changing facilities are almost nonexistent here  &mdash;  or wear them underneath the street clothes for the whole day.  I had seen the &#8220;Wholesome Wear&#8221; website a while back and was actually thinking of ordering one of the outfits for just this purpose.  </p>
<p>As for burqinis preventing melanoma, that&rsquo;s a nice side effect of the design  &mdash;  not saying it was the original intent.  But, here&rsquo;s a reason to focus more on the *substance* of objects and less on their *symbolism*.  </p>
<p>What do you guys think of the Olympic full-body racing swimsuits?  They cover a lot, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not taking issue with your comments.  There certainly are plenty of &#8220;intruders&#8221;.  But it should be pointed out this young woman is not an intruder and has nowhere to go back to.  She is French and is a CONVERT to Islam.  That is another disturbing thing which is becoming common  (in France and elsewhere in Europe)  and which presents a big problem also.</p>
<p>Reading between the lines, I can virtually guarantee that she has an Islamic husband (a North African) whom she seeks to please and who probably demands this.  I also note that they did not give her name in the story.</p>
<p>This whole thing is not really about swimming pools and bathing suits. It is about a subtle, on-going demographic and cultural conquest. The French are right to resist. They should have been doing much more of it all along!</p>

<p>I read with amusement your post about the swim trunks - especially since the French regime wants to &#8220;reduce communicable diseases&#8221;. You were smart to go swimming with your own trunks. Heck, how do you know the trunks for rent didn&rsquo;t have a fungus?</p>
<p>Remember the heat-related deaths in France during summer a few years ago, Whiteplight? I was stunned to find out there is virtually no air conditioning in France - to eliminate the &#8220;risk of communicable diseases&#8221;- according to the French medical community.</p>

<p>Korean Guy,<br>
Either you&rsquo;re playing everyone on this site, you&rsquo;re being sarcastic or you&rsquo;ve eaten some bad Kim Chee laced with Angel Dust.</p>
<p>You don;t maintain a heritage when you intermarry with people who have no desire to maintain that &#8220;HERITAGE&#8221;. They want to destroy it and turn it into a Caliphate. Gradually the ethnic Gallic/ Frankish heritage will be eliminated by the overwhelming number of immigrants who do not come from a culture that is anything like that of the French. <br>
To site a simple example: Ethnic French, as do most Europeans love their pets, oops I meant &#8220;animal companions&rsquo;. Sorry PETA! Dogs are especially favored. Muslims hate dogs! <br>
They also apparently aren&rsquo;t fond of women except to be used as receptacles for their lust.<br>
Europeans enjoy alcoholic beverages. Muslims hate that!<br>
Italians and Spaniards love their &#8220;prosciutto&#8221; and &#8220;jamón&#8221; respectively. That will be totally forbidden under Halal law. By contrast Jews living in predominantly Christian countries don&rsquo;t eat Pork products and Crustaceans but don&rsquo;t attempt to prevent anyone else from enjoying it.<br>
Sarkozy is ethnically a Hun not a Gaul but he&rsquo;s still European although tragically clueless. IF Muslims gain control in France his beautiful First Lady Carla Bruni ( Italiana) would probably be stoned to death for posing nude.</p>
