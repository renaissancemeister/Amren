<h1>A Deck Stacked with Race Cards</h1>

	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, liberal Democrats have to accuse their opponents of racism. Indeed, somewhat to their credit, fighting racism  &mdash;  alas, even where it doesn&rsquo;t exist  &mdash;  is one of the reasons they became liberal Democrats in the first place.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the great irony of the Obama presidency. It was Obama&rsquo;s supporters who hinted, teased, promised, and prophesied that Obama would help America &#8220;transcend race.&#8221; But now, it is they who shrink from their own promised land.</p>
<p>After all, it was not Obama&rsquo;s detractors who immediately fell into the comfortable groove of racial grievance and familiar &#8220;narratives&#8221; when Henry Louis Gates insisted that a police instructor in racial sensitivity had to be a racist. That was Obama and his choir of heralds.</p>
<p>From Day 1, Obama&rsquo;s supporters have tirelessly cultivated the idea that anything inconvenient for the first black president just might be terribly, terribly racist.</p>
<p>This was always the nasty side of Obama&rsquo;s implied hope for unity. Obama gave oxygen to the idea that disagreement with him amounted to obstructing his mission to &#8220;transcend race.&#8221; During the campaign, that meant anyone who got in his way was wittingly or unwittingly abetting racism (just ask Bill Clinton). A writer for Slate insisted journalists must not call attention to the fact that Obama is &#8220;skinny.&#8221; Such observations fuel racism by highlighting his physical appearance, and that in turn might suddenly alert racist American voters to the fact that Obama is {snip} black.</p>
<p>Now that he&rsquo;s president, if you question his tax policies, energy plans, or health-care ambitions, you are &#8220;hoping he will fail&#8221;  &mdash;  and that, with the help of roundabout reasoning, is tantamount to hoping we cannot transcend race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His shock troops make the same argument about race, sometimes with sophistication, sometimes with the kind of lucid clarity only profound stupidity can provide. For instance, actress Janeane Garofalo summed up the tea parties thusly: &#8220;This is about hating a black man in the White House. This is racism straight up.&#8221;</p>
<p>A more sophisticated version comes from Princeton professor Melissa Harris-Lacewell, who finds racism in complaints that socialized medicine would result in fewer Americans &#8220;taking responsibility&#8221; for their own health care. &#8220;What we know over the past 25 years,&#8221; she told NPR, &#8220;is that language of personal responsibility is often a code language used against poor and minority communities.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Suddenly, if conservatives want to transcend race, we have to agree to massive increases in the size of government and socialized medicine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not transcending race, it&rsquo;s using Obama&rsquo;s race to bully the opposition into acquiescence. Actually transcending race would require treating Obama like any other president. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s dismaying is how the press and Democrats are so desperate to obscure this point. The only notable political violence at a town hall was against a black man, roughed up by pro-Obama toughs. The assault weapon lawfully carried to a demonstration was carried by a black man. That supposedly racist poster depicting Obama as the Joker? (An LA Weekly writer fumed, &#8220;The only thing missing is a noose.&#8221;) That was created by a Palestinian-American supporter of left-wing garden gnome Dennis Kucinich. Whoops!</p>

		<p>With all the focus on Obama being the &#8220;first black president&#8221; it&rsquo;s easy to forget that he&rsquo;s merely the team mascot. They might as well have ran a tv newsanchor for the job since the only skill appears to be reading a teleprompter. Does anyone really thing Obama is running anything? Indeed, it&rsquo;s been a long time since any president was really president. </p>
<p>Which brings me to my main point and the reason Obama was chosen to run in the first place - his sponsors thought that the clout coming from being the &#8220;first black president&#8221; might be enough to tip the balance in favor of all the programs they&rsquo;ve been itching for. You see, none of the white presidents could ever quite carry it off because as a white president the <i>issue</i> was always the issue. But with a black president one can make <i>race</i> the issue and thereby distract from the real issue. That&rsquo;s why you have the media screaming that anyone who disagrees with the policies is &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>

<p>Alas Mr. Goldberg, you seem to miss your own point here!</p>
<p>There is no &ldquo;sophistication&rdquo; with these Marxist traitors. It is always the same; be it the: recklessly wallowing imbecilic Garofalo, the screeching NPR Princeton professor and magpie Comrade Harris-Lacewell, or some other feral Red media abominations like Maureen Dowd and Keith Olbermann, they have nothing but contempt for their own people and country. They hate us, they hate what we have (and what our ancestors have) built, but they are content to live off of it and simultaneously attempt to destroy it. This is both profound and lucid stupidity, seen as a clarity of sanctimonious transcendence.</p>
<p>It is the engorged vampirism of an unredeemable and utterly despicable &ldquo;elite,&rdquo; that knows nothing of: the laws of God, love of their own countrymen, or history&rsquo;s twisting retributions. </p>
<p>Thus, if God is with us, and their day of reckoning comes as swiftly as his unstoppable will and the merciless tides of history will allow&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.?????????????????</p>
<p>Enough said!<br>

		<p>Why not?<br>
They have used this tactic with almost complete success for decades.  The McCain campaign gutted itself in an attempt to avoid the smear.  Obama&rsquo;s whole public career and most of his private sector career was race related in the most blatant fashion.</p>
<p>Conservatives are gutless in the face of the accusation and rush to surrender.  So why are we surprised the left is continuing what it has done for 4o years?</p>

		<p>None of this comes as any surprise to AMRENers. It is only surprising to the brainwashed masses. Rather than &#8220;transcending&#8221; race, electing blacks usually only makes the color lines ever more sharply defined.</p>
<p>I discovered this in my own &#8220;hometown&#8221; of Gary, Indiana. The election of the black activist and racial grievance monger Richard G. Hatcher only served to drive white people out, making Gary one of the blackest and most depressed cities in America.</p>

<p>I wonder what makes her draw that conclusion? The truth?</p>
<p><i>Mark Potok of the dismayingly left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center insists Obama has &ldquo;triggered fears among fairly large numbers of white people in this country that they are somehow losing their country.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Again, another truth. Whites are losing their country.</p>
<p>One tactic the left uses is to state the fact but attempt to make it sound like the fact is paranoia.</p>

		<p>The best part was Goldberg&rsquo;s jab at the &#8220;dismayingly left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center.&#8221; Of course, &#8220;virulent, white hating Southern Poverty Law Center&#8221; would have been more descriptive but we all have to start somewhere. Is there hope for the neo-cons? If the racial excesses of the Obama Administration continue to mount there may very well be. In the end it&rsquo;s simply a question of whites defending themselves against the hatred of those dead set against them and the question of spreading democracy overseas will seem as unimportant as reality TV. And I sense things changing very fast in this country. </p>

<p>I have to be honest.  Posts like this read like plants to get us to feel so hopeless we just give up.<br>
One post alone won&rsquo;t do it.  It&rsquo;s the drip, drip, drip of it all that will.  If you let it. <br>
But even if the above post isn&rsquo;t a plant, it might as well be. <br>

		<p>Commentary like that in the original article is extremely damaging to the future of our nation, for the simple reason that it helps normalize the idea that &#8220;transcending race&#8221; is a desirable outcome.</p>
<p>On the contrary, transcending race will be the death of our civilization, our culture, and our people - as demonstrated so eloquently by the contributors to AR.</p>
<p>Every time a White person hears the &#8220;transcend race&#8221; argument, they should immediately counter with the question &#8220;Why do you wish to destroy diversity?&#8221; and put the opponent on the defensive.  Make them explain why they think it is a good idea for their own people to vanish from the pages of time.  If you can make them defend their argument, you may be able to make them THINK about what they are actually embracing - death and destruction on a titanic scale, for everything we know and love.</p>
<p>These terms and concepts that the media bandy about are more than just semantics - they are the future of our race.  Never concede a single inch of ground, and resolutely oppose those who embrace our destruction.  Reason is your shield, and knowledge is your sword.  Use them wisely, and continually.</p>

		<p>This is Example No. 5284 as to why different races should not be forced to live together.  Racial agendas complicate all policy discussions, delaying resolution, and forcing inadequate compromise &#8220;solutions&#8221; that do not remedy the problem, but, instead, address some racial agenda.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism leads to societal conflict, inefficiency, lower productivity, lower standard of living, and ultimately, destruction and Balkinization of society, if not outright war.</p>

		<p>We can&rsquo;t &#8220;transcend&#8221; race when the issue is of one of black and white.  Here the problem is not one of skin color or ancient customs and mores.  The problem is that there&rsquo;s no place for black Africans in a modern, productive, civil society.  They simply cannot contribute in a meaningful way to a Euro-centric civilization, and left to their own devices, set about destroying one as soon as their numbers reach critical mass.  All we can do to preserve what we have created is to separate outselves from them, by whatever means necessary.</p>
<p>I suspect that the means will prove to be the breakup of the US, and probably much sooner than later, with whites staking out their territories and excluding blacks, again by whatever means are necessary.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that the US today, like the former USSR, has become too racially, ethnically, culturally, and morally &#8220;diverse&#8221; to be ruled centrally. Breaking it up will prove the only means of salvaging what made this once-great nation great, a status that cannot continue with blacks and other burgeoning minority groups laying claim to wealth and expanded rights they had no part in creating in the first place.</p>

		<p>I agree with Visine&rsquo;s post. One of the most potent weapons in the arsenal of the intellectuals who, over many decades, have been ridiculing our heritage and detroying this country and the West in general, has been VOCABULARY. Blacks (here and abroad) and other non-Whites are free to transcend race by emulating our culture as best they are able to, but it is not our burden and never should have been (PACE R. Kipling). And certainly not in our own countries.<br>
  If some half-African Chinese would have been crazy enough to seek the premiership in China, he at least would have been sane enough to go by a Han name, and to fervently pass himself off in accordance with his Chinese (not foreign) parentage. But the West has always (since the ancient Greeks) sought universal truths. That is part of its great strength but also (we now see) the root cause of its potential downfall.</p>

<p>This is another popular conservative misconception.  In fact, it is always conservatives like Reagan and Bush who massively increase the size of government, not Democrats or liberals.</p>
<p>Although I do agree that liberals have this tendancy to play the race card or see resistence to anything about Obama as racism, they are right, aren&rsquo;t they?  The first reason we don&rsquo;t like him is simply because a black man can&rsquo;t represent a majority white nation without cohearsive measures that are anti-white by their function and outcome.  Who cares if it is racist!  Everyone is a racist, except liars.</p>
<p>But Republicans and conservatives are picking all the wrong fights and going so far out into the field to find issues that the left is having a field day showing them how uninformed, backward, and UNEDUCATED conservatives tend to be.  A ten year old could write this article.</p>

		<p>&hellip;.&#8221; language of personal responsibility is often a code language used against poor and minority communities.&rdquo; {snip}</p>
<p>I predict that as more whites are abandoned by the corporate lobby and increase in poverty and grow in their self-image as a minority group, they will see the sense of ideas like socialized medicine, or at least the idea that whites need to stick together and assist one another because one&rsquo;s own survival is irrevokably linked to others.  </p>
<p>European whites figured this out some time ago, but are losing control of their systems for the same reason white Americans are losing theirs; lofty Christian-influenced idealism which includes the addiction to appearing virtuous via self-sacrifice.  </p>
<p>Also, both suffer from the usurpation of this misdirected emotion by the corporate state that is only interested in the supply of cheap labor and taxpayers, regardless of race, color, or creed.  Their folly is the belief, as with the co-dependent beaten wife, that they can change the customs of immigrants because of their conceit and belief in their own cultural superiority.</p>

<p> During World War II, the most feared General was George Patton. But even he realised that he was nothing without the full backing of his army.White people aren&rsquo;t afraid of these people, it&rsquo;s the fact that they have the full backing of the federal government behind them. Remove that from the equation and the racial problems in America would all but disappear overnight. I believe the majority of whites want to live in peace and prosperity. I further believe that the majority of other races want the same thing, however they have a few people making vast sums of money by keeping things stirred up.<br>
 One thing is for certain, the status qou cannot go on forever. Whites are being more and more marginalized, discriminated against and murdered by the other races at an alarming rate while the government continues to support them in their activities. Police officers are being trained to have special consideration for the &#8220;protected classes&#8221;,colleges are looking for more ways to keep the white man out and white women are constantly bombarded with white men looking like a fool by all facets of the mainstream media.The pschycological conditioning to look at the white man as something less than human will one day backfire on them and on that day of reckoning all hell will break loose.<br>
