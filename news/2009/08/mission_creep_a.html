			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol M. Swain, Huffington Post, August 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In case you missed the story, last November 4th a polling precinct in Philadelphia, PA was patrolled by an organization called the New Black Panther Party, a Marxist group that in 2000, was listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a racial hate group. Video footage shot in 2008, show Black Panther precinct workers intimidating white voters. This was covered by the news organizations, and resulted in charges being filed by the Bush Department of Justice, whose job it is to defend and protect the voting rights of all Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The SPLC has been mum on the issue, despite the fact that in 2000, it included the New Black Panther Party among its annual list of hate groups. In fact, what is most shocking is that the SPLC has spent far more resources hounding conservative organizations, such as the Center for Immigration Studies, and prominent citizens like CNN&rsquo;s award-winning anchor Lou Dobbs, than it has protecting the civil rights of American voters, which includes white people as well as black. The unrelenting attacks on Mr. Dobbs and others are shameless. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Mission creep occurs when an organization strays beyond its original purpose and engages in actions antithetical to its goals. Rather than monitoring hate groups, the Southern Poverty Law Center has become one.<br>

		<p>   The thing is; the SPLC has never strayed beyond its original mission. It&rsquo;s original mission has always been to subvert freedom. It&rsquo;s original mission was,and remains, to be the destruction of the United States as we know it. Never has the SPLC been in the business of protecting the rights of ALL Americans. Nor American citizens of the white race. Just the opposite, their mission is to destroy the white race.</p>

		<p>The SPLC has included some militant and extremist black groups in its list of hate groups.  But something in my bones told me all along that there was something amiss, and I finally figured it out:  All the black groups on the SPLC&rsquo;s radar explicitly target Jews, the SPLC&rsquo;s traditional human ATM machines.</p>
<p>What the SPLC is too dense to realize is that black anti-Semitism and white right-wing anti-Semitism are not the same thing.  The latter think of Jews as something vastly different, racially so, than most whites.  The former think of Jews as just a whiter variety of whites.  Black anti-Semitism is nothing more than an especially vitriolic hatred of whites.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this article is written by a black liberal, and therefore will be extra cans in the pantry when trying to turn the left against the SPLC.</p>

<p>In many ways, I do respect Mrs. Swain. She holds a good deal of insight into the growing racial problems of this country, and she also takes a remarkably forbearing approach to white nationalism/race realism. However, here she is totally off base; the SPLC has never been, nor will it ever be, anything other than a anti-white and un-American hate/terrorist group.  It has but one goal, the total extermination of the white race, both in the USA and on the planet Earth.</p>
<p>End of story!</p>

		<p>Sorry to disagree with the author, but the SPLC has always been a hate group that smears prowhite and conservative groups or individuals.  It specializes in hysterical mailings to its vast mailing list. SPLC frightens liberals by claiming that Nazis are everywhere and about to seize power. Result? Millions in contributions to SPLC boss Morris Dees and a small number of cronies. SPLC is a racket no better or worse than the Mafia or the Chinese organized crime gangs.</p>

		<p>Cant argue with anything said here, but I do take exception to the last line where the writer states that the splc has BECOME a hate group. The truth is they have BEEN a hate group for quite some time, though they are very selective in whom they hate.  </p>

		<p>The SPLC has NEVER &#8220;creeped&#8221; from ANY &#8220;mission,&#8221; and this shows the ignorance at HUFFPO. The SPLC&rsquo;s &#8220;mission&#8221; is, and has always been, a CON game to garnish money from whining, bleeding-heart Liberals (both rich and poor) in the name of fighting &#8220;Hate,&#8221; something more important to a Liberal than AIR! And sine the SPLC can find very little REAL &#8220;hate&#8221; it will manufacture it if it has to, and which it does most of the time.</p>

		<p>It takes a black woman to say what whites are afraid to say about an organization that is so hateful it defies description and makes one wonder how anybody could support such an organization.</p>
<p>On second thought, though, Lou Dobbs has blasted them frequently on his show, calling them, &#8220;Nothing but a fund-rasing group.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Reading the comments at the Huffington Post made me ill.  The vile, naked hatred of the Global Majorities against Whites (and the self-hating Whites that crave the attention they bestow on such circus freaks) was eye opening.  And I thought my eyes were opened years ago.</p>
<p>There is no arguing with those people.  There is no common ground.  There is no possibility of compromise, not even of White Flight as they now hunt you down like a mad dog.</p>
<p>Well, there is an upside.  When they finally provoke the fight they think is already won, there will be a lot of spare room for the rest of us.  Even the cities will be appealing again.</p>

<p>In the video I saw there was no voter intimidation. It is, however, edging closer to leftist rhetoric being made real: politics Africa style. Where they pretty much don&rsquo;t have free elections.</p>

		<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, and many other so-called &#8220;anti-racism groups&#8221; are, in reality, the real hate groups. They are motivated by their hatred of whites, which is why they remain silent on the many non-white against white crimes throughout America. When these organizations claim they are &#8220;anti-racist,&#8221; what they really mean is &#8220;anti-white.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think what Prof. Swain means by paranoia-industrial complex &#8220;mission creep&#8221; is that the Bernie Madoff scandal has hurt the bottom lines of many SPLC donors.  Therefore, the SPLC has had to &#8220;creep&#8221; from lying about the extreme right, to lying about the far right, to lying about the hard right, now to lying about the right.</p>

		<p>Carol Swaine is a sensible black woman with moderate views.  But look at the comments for her article on the Huffington Post website and you&rsquo;ll see that they&rsquo;re nearly all attacking Swaine, Lou Dobbs, and Republicans generally, while defending illegal immigration.  As we all know, our worst enemies are white.</p>

		<p>Here is the $PLC&rsquo;s main goal:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Dees&rsquo; onetime business partner Millard Fuller once said: &#8216;Morris and I &hellip; shared the overriding purpose of making a pile of money. We were not particular about how we did it; we just wanted to be independently rich&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And their main tactic:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;exaggerating the prevalence and capabilities of racist and extremist rightwing groups operating in the United States in order to frighten supporters into donating money to SPLC&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent years, they have taken up defending illegal aliens in court using their high-powered lawyers and endless funds.  The specious $PLC represented two illegal aliens against Ranch Rescue, eventually winning the case and as a settlement, Ranch Rescue had to turn over its 70-acre property and headquarters to the illegal aliens.</p>
<p>This is their idea of justice and they play hard ball to get it.  Defend Whites?  Even in the face of hard evidence including video that clearly shows White voter intimidation by black thugs?  Never.  Even the so-called justice department won&rsquo;t defend us.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as &#8216;the most blatant form of voter intimidation&rsquo; that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://stuffblackpeopledontlike.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stuffblackpeopledontlike.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>Can you imagine the hell that would ensue if the races were reversed?  I am trying to Spread the Word as much as I can to my liberal family members and a few friends (and it&rsquo;s hard going).  If Whites were to organize as a voting bloc, we could put an end to this overt war against our people.</p>

		<p>I heard Prof. Swain speak at a panel discussion a couple years ago, and found her to be surprisingly evenhanded in talking about the &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; Right, in the sense of trying to understand the movement on its own terms and in its own words.  I got the sense you could actually have an honest discussion with her on racial issues   &mdash;   something virtually unknown in academia.  For all I know, she genuinely sympathizes with the some aspects of the movement from her perspective as an outside observer.  </p>
<p>The fact that there are so many hysterical responses on HuffPo, however, does not surprise me at all.  The foaming-at-the-mouth outrage at Swain&rsquo;s plainly truthful observations is much more typical of what to expect from the modern Left.</p>

		<p>WR:  I agree. Carol Swain is left-wing, and pro black, but reasonable, and is not given to paranoia and fatuous analyses.  A few years ago, she released a book about her views of WN/RR, and devoted a lot of space to AR and the CofCC.  It wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a stretch to think that she was halfway sympathetic.  </p>

		<p>This is real progress.  The Huffington Post is one of those ultra liberal anti White American websites.  In other news, the US Commission on Civil Rights is objecting strongly to the DOJ and Holder&rsquo;s decision to drop the case against the Black Panthers who obstructed the polling site.</p>
<p>As far as I know, this is the very first time the Civil Rights Commission has not been viciously anti White.</p>
