<h1>Asylum-Seekers Facing Destitution</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Setsuko Kamiya, Japan Times, Aug. 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Laurent Kirobi came to Japan from a west African country and is seeking political asylum. Exactly a year has passed since he applied to the Immigration Bureau, but he still hasn&rsquo;t been called for an interview to determine whether he is eligible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know why it takes so long,&#8221; said Kirobi, whose real name is being withheld in light of his delicate situation. His visa already has expired, which is not unusual for asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>After applying for refugee status, Kirobi, who is in his early 30s, sought financial support from the Refugee Assistance Headquarters (RHQ), a Foreign Ministry-affiliated body. As most asylum-seekers are not allowed to work, the humanitarian aid from RHQ is the only means people in his position have to survive.</p>
<p>Kirobi received RHQ support for eight months but his request for a four-month extension was rejected. He was cut off in May.</p>
<p>After April, dozens of asylum-seekers have found themselves in the same situation due to a change in the way the government doles out its limited funds. Priority is given to those considered the neediest.</p>
<p>The triage highlights the jump in asylum-seekers last year, which hit a record high of 1,599, or nearly double the 816 who applied in 2008.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry managed to win an increase in the humanitarian aid budget this year but it is still insufficient. While the bureaucrats say they are doing what they can, nongovernment organizations insist they should be doing more.</p>
<p>To deal with the jump in refugees, the NGOs are running a fundraising campaign to help those cut off from government aid. At the same time, they are pushing the government to consider extending the periods of assistance or allowing asylum-seekers to work so they can survive until their interviews.</p>
<p>Without a working permit or friends, Kirobi nearly went homeless after his aid was cut off. He was saved by the Japan Association for Refugees, which provided him emergency shelter in Chiba Prefecture that was set up in July with donations. There are 11 people at the shelter, but JAR says many more potential candidates are likely to surface.</p>
<p>Desperate for a means to live, some asylum-seekers risk their status and look for jobs to support themselves, but Kirobi said he is afraid of doing that. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to be caught. I just stay and wait,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nearly half of those seeking shelter in Japan are from Myanmar, where the crackdown by the junta in 2007 increased the flow of refugees. Others include Turkish Kurds and Sri Lankans, but more Africans have been visible since the G8 summit in Hokkaido last year, where Japan voiced strong support for mineral-rich Africa, experts said.</p>
<p>Those working closely with the refugee hopefuls estimate that applicant numbers this year will be similar to last year&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Seeking asylum in Japan is daunting. Applicants are basically not permitted to work, do not receive health insurance and are ineligible for public assistance.</p>
<p>Instead, the Foreign Ministry funnels financial support to those in dire need via RHQ. Adults receive ¥1,500 a day and children receive ¥750. If housing is needed, a family can receive a maximum of ¥60,000 a month for rent, while singles can get ¥40,000. This is all less than what a Japanese citizen on welfare would get.</p>
<p>The support lasts four months in principle but was being extended by an average of 9.3 months until last year.</p>
<p>According to the ministry, an average of 95 people received support each month in 2007. But in 2008 that jumped to 211.</p>
<p>In December, the ministry saw its ¥65 million refugee support budget run out, three months before the end of the fiscal year. in an emergency move, the ministry got permission from the Finance Ministry and diverted other funds that were not being used at the time to continue supporting the refugees, said Mitsuko Shino, director of the Human Rights and Humanitarian Division.</p>
<p>Thus, the actual amount of money spent for the refugee support fund totaled ¥147 million in fiscal 2008, she said.</p>
<p>For fiscal 2009 that began in April, the Foreign Ministry managed to raise the refugee aid budget to ¥190 million, up 67 percent from the previous year, said Shino, who admitted it&rsquo;s still not sufficient for the number of asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to prioritize those whose lives would be in serious danger if they didn&rsquo;t receive these funds&#8221; to keep the aid running within the budget, Shino said.</p>
<p>In April, the ministry set up criteria for handing out aid and put priority on those who are seriously ill, pregnant or caring for a child under 12 months old, children under 15 and people older than 60, and those who had visas when they applied for asylum.</p>
<p>In April, before the new criteria were implemented, 263 people got aid. That dropped to 174 in May, Shino said.</p>
<p>JAR estimates the new criteria will force around 100 more asylum-seekers to be cut off and go homeless any day now.</p>
<p>In late June, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations stated that the Justice Ministry should allow asylum-seekers provisional stay permits so they can work. They also called for legislation allowing all asylum-seekers to work.</p>
<p>But a Justice Ministry official said the government would stick firmly to its current rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&rsquo;t change this policy because overstayers may abuse that rule and apply for refugee status with the aim of getting work,&#8221; said the official, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>She admitted the refugee application process takes an average of one to two years, which has often been criticized as unreasonably long.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we must do is speed up the administration process to accept or reject the applications,&#8221; she said, adding that the ministry has added 10 more employees to help out.</p>
<p>Supporters are skeptical this will help.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the government cannot decide whether to give refugee status or not in six months, then that&rsquo;s its responsibility,&#8221; said Hiroaki Ishii, deputy secretary general of JAR. &#8220;They should at least give asylum-seekers working permits.&#8221;</p>
<p>JAR and other groups, including the Catholic Tokyo International Center and Japan Lawyers Network for Refugees, will continue fundraising efforts until the end of September.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all Kirobi can do is wait. Unlike many asylum-seekers who end up in detention centers for overstaying their visas, Kirobi somehow escaped that fate. &#8220;I hear it&rsquo;s really terrible, so I&rsquo;m very lucky. It&rsquo;s like God was with me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But with no money and no job, Kirobi says he feels physical freedom may be the only advantage he has.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if you are outside, when you have nothing, you can&rsquo;t do anything. And you can go crazy,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>  It would seem to me that the Japanese realize what lies ahead by flooding their country with outsiders. On the other hand, the &#8220;west&#8221; has no clue.I know I will take alot of fire for my next statement, however, I truly believe that our &#8220;Judeo-Christian&#8221; belief system is used against us to feel a false sense of guilt for atrocities that may or may not have been committed in the past. And it has worked very, very well. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I believe in God, from the standpoint of the christian belief system. However, I refuse to be guilted into anything. It would seem that we have done so much for the rest of the world, that is now expected. I believe only in my God, my race, and my own. Now, even country comes in way down the list. It is too late to save this country as a whole, there aren&rsquo;t enough of us interested in doing so. My interests lie in saving and promoting my own race. Out of the ashes, a country will arise. So, in closing, I say bravo for the Japanese people, at least they get it. </p>

		<p>I wholeheartedly agree with poster #1&hellip;</p>
<p>The Christian Church has changed (or was it subverted) so much in the last decades and has pushed the &#8220;guilt&#8221; complex onto the White race ONLY. They push the &#8220;Feed The Children&#8221; programs, adoptions of 3rd world kids, etc.  Why is that? The churches are also behind all the refugees coming into America. I will never forgive them for that. I quit going to Church a long time ago and listen off the net to a Church that IMO is the true Christian church.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve lately come to the conclusion that every race should look after its own, exclusively.</p>
<p>If an African seeking political asylum rejects every other country in the African sub-continent, then he should be denied acceptance anywhere else.  </p>
<p>The world must be divided into zones which correspond to racial settlement, and these boundaries must be the limits of altruism.</p>

		<p>Japan is on a steep slippery slope here. Once the NGOs are allowed into the process there&rsquo;ll be continual loosening of the rules. There will be appeals, humanitarian interventions, law suits, church asylums, and Japan born children rights. The people who expel failed refugees will be defunded. Lenient precedents will be established left, right and center. Watch for the amnesty cycle to get started followed by empty government promises. The government bureaucracy will be nickel and dimed into submission. </p>
<p>The Japanese people and government have to understand there is no middle ground here. Either be ultra strict and don&rsquo;t start down this road or else face the fact that there will be an uncontrolled flood of refugees entering Japan. </p>

		<p>They are starting to &#8216;try it on&rsquo; with Japan - a nation as distant as it is possible to get from Africa, and a nation that has no ties with Africa.<br>
 Just another typical display of black shamelessness and brazeness (incidentally two qualities that Japapanese people absolutely despise).<br>
  The Japanes have been strong up until in displaying a zero-tolerance attitude to the &#8216;asylum racket&rsquo;, seeing the racket for what it is and having a certain generalized contempt for the brazen, decitful, mendacious liars that these con-men ultimately are.<br>
 I cling to the forlorn hope that the Japanese remain strong and sensible.<br>
  The consequences of weakness here are dire - just look at England.</p>

		<p>No surprise here&hellip;like many East Asians Japanese are much more<br>
ethnocntric than the West  and are always looking to blame crime and an increase in social problems on an influx of foreigners,no matter if numbers are far smaller per capita than in  West Europe,US,Canada,Australia etc&hellip;Africans unfortunately(for them)  are way down on the scale of those looking for a hearty welcome here. While westerners and skilled workers from  other countries fare better, unskilled low intelligent third worlders with little to contribute to an advanced high tech society  are certainly not going to be given the red carpet.<br>
 Also Japan has been in recession since 1990 and with a rapidly aging population which will need much more help<br>
and support from a declining working base I think the gates for these asylum seekers /refugees will well and truly be shut.<br>
 Also the previous comment concerning ex Japanese PM Nakasone`s remarks about blacks and hispanics in the US is I believe not an anomaly.Japanese have also watched the decline  in US ecnomic power along with the  growing political clout of miniorities and are determined to stay relatively ethnically homogenous and avoid most of the social problems we now face in the West with increased immigration from third world basket cases.            </p>

		<p>It is more than passing strange that a &#8220;political&#8221; refugee from W. Africa would find himself in Japan, roughly half way around the world from his starting point. I wonder why he declined to settle in N.Africa, the Middle East, or India, for example. Gee, I wonder why?    </p>

		<p>Meanwhile, all Kirobi can do is wait. No &#8216;Kirobi&rsquo;, you can go back where you came from and stop expecting other people to support you. Japan needs to go around and pick up all the African trash and put them on any number of aid ships heading to Africa and, once there, just shove them out. If they don&rsquo;t accept their &#8216;refugees&rsquo;, they don&rsquo;t get the aid. Same in this country, round them up, take them to the border, and give them a good shove. It&rsquo;s really not that complicated.</p>
