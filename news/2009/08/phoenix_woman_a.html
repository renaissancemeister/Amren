<h1>Phoenix Woman Admits Torturing, Killing Disabled Man</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KTVK-TV (Phoenix), August 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a jailhouse interview with 3TV&rsquo;s [KTVK-TV&rsquo;s] Marissa Wingate, a Phoenix woman admitted killing a man confined to a motorized wheelchair after torturing him for days because he was a &#8220;snitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela Simpson, 33, told 3TV she promised Terry Neely sex and drugs in order to get him to come to her North Phoenix apartment.</p>
<p>Once there, Simpson said she beat Simpson with a tire iron, hammered a nail into his head, pulled his teeth and strangled him with a television cord.</p>
<p>&#8220;You made him watch it through a mirror?&#8221; Wingate asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; Simpson replied calmly. &#8220;He needed to see what he deserved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wingate describe Simpson as articulate and straightforward. When Wingate asked her why she killed Neely, the answer, to Simpson, seemed simple.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want my children or the people I consider family to be in a place where there are snitches,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Simpson told Wingate she dismembered Neely&rsquo;s body and stuffed it into a trash can, which she then torched. The burning trash bin was found outside a North Phoenix church on Aug. 5. Police arrested Simpson for the murder on Aug. 19.</p>
<p>Simpson, who was already in jail when police caught up with her, told Wingate this is not the first time she&rsquo;s killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe informants and child molesters should be killed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. period,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wingate asked Simpson if she felt guilty about Neely&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guilty? For ridding the world of a snitch? No, I don&rsquo;t feel guilty,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>What if Marissa needed to snitch, in order to bring a child molester to justice? Say, if the guy lived in a remote area, or in a gated community and where there was security. What a dilema!</p>

		<p>He was a lonely cripple who had nothing in this world. Any attention from anyone was all he wanted. A basic human desire.</p>
<p>Whatever you, I or anyone else may think of miscengination, he was attempting to fill a basic human need, and the fact that he had to go to a murderous negress to get it is more of an indictment on the white race as a whole that it is on him as a white man.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances, miscengination aside, he should get a pass and I have all the sympathy in the world for him, that he should have to die a lonely tragic and brutal death at the hands of such an alien being, simply for trying to sample in any way possible what most of us take for granted.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my children or the people I consider family to be in a place where there are snitches,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>If her children and the people she considers family weren&rsquo;t out breaking the law, she wouldn&rsquo;t have to be worried about snitches, now would she? But like most blacks, she doesn&rsquo;t think that deeply into the matter. </p>

<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;   Have a little sympathy for him John.  He was White and he was disabled.  Sometimes in a situation like that you&rsquo;re willing to accept things you wouldn&rsquo;t normally accept.</p>

		<p>This whole story is quite morbid and also incomplete. Snitch? Concerning what? Sex and {drugs} with a black woman,Why? Were his arms also disabled that he couldn&rsquo;t overpower and subdue her? Simpson will be put in a cage with other human/animal deviants where she belongs&hellip; but she does have convictions..!Karma. </p>

		<p>What is it, in the Black psyche, that drives these creatures to such vile acts? It has to be genetic. The tendency of Blacks to gravitate to heineous crimes and savage barbarism is universal. Not just an American phenomenon.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen such a remarkable display of warped values, in which reporting a crime is viewed as far worse than the crime, any crime.  She would rather kill than have her children be around a &#8220;snitch&#8221;.  You couldn&rsquo;t make this stuff up.</p>

		<p>So, two men in Texas drag a black man, James Byrd to his death. A terrible crime, no doubt. I am a race realist, and a White Nationalist, but I certainly don&rsquo;t support unprovoked brutality in any circumstance. The death of that one man was plastered upon every front page, each national newscast followed every detail, the Sunday shows were awash in commentary and coverage of that single death for weeks on end. Where is the media examination of the greater significance of THIS brutal crime?</p>
<p>The phenomenon evidenced by this crime is a complete breakdown of law and order in the black community in America. The &#8220;No Snitches&#8221; campaign is nationwide, and exclusively black. The most violent segment of our society is now en masse refusing to cooperate with police in their investigation of crime. Now, they are terrorizing others who do support law and order. Just when you think they can&rsquo;t be worse&hellip;&hellip;they are!</p>

		<p>DiMaggio:</p>
<p>What the media also didn&rsquo;t say for the most part about the Byrd dragging death is that Byrd and the three white guys were all prison thugs who knew each other and despised each other from a common cohabitation as a guest of the state of Texas.  There was very little race angle involved.  It was a matter of prison thugs behaving like prison thugs.</p>
<p>Within two weeks of the Byrd death, there was a dragging death of a white teenager in Kansas City, a black was the one that did it.  That&rsquo;s also something you didn&rsquo;t hear about from the MSM.</p>

		<p>To DiMaggio, I can only state the obvious. Race crimes can only be committed by Whites. If a Black commits a race crime (against Whites), our screwed up media passes it off as a simple street crime. Like that nightmare in Knoxville, TN where five Black ex-cons tortured, gang-raped, mutilated and murdered that White co-ed couple. Brutal and sordid as it was, it was only treated as a local (Knoxville) news item by the media.</p>
<p>Now you wouldn&rsquo;t call our media BIASED, would you?</p>

		<p>Blacks whine all the time about crime in their neighborhoods, but when it comes to actually dealing with this problem, they&rsquo;re quick to make excuses for the perps and as harsh as possible on the &#8220;snitches&#8221; (read: &#8220;anyone who cooperates with investigators&#8221;.)</p>
<p>This is an indication that blacks actually DO NOT WANT to live in safe neighborhoods.</p>
