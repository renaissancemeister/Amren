<h1>Akaka Bill Clashes With Hawaii Ideals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>H. William Burgess and Thomas Macdonald, Honolulu Advertiser, August 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is widely known that the Akaka bill would enable federal recognition of Native Hawaiians as a political entity. It is not so widely known that the bill defines &#8220;Native Hawaiian&#8221; as anyone, anywhere in the world with at least one ancestor indigenous to Hawai&rsquo;i. And it defines &#8220;indigenous to Hawai&rsquo;i&#8221; to mean anyone who lived in Hawai&rsquo;i before 1778 when Captain Cook and westerners first arrived.</p>
<p>Duke professor Stuart Benjamin, formerly with the Clinton Justice Department, was the only impartial constitutional law expert called on to testify Aug. 6 before the U.S. Senate Indian Affairs Committee. He stated that the above definition of Native Hawaiian was too broad, with members having too little connection to a historic tribe, or to each other, to be considered a tribe. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Souter, concurring in Rice v. Cayetano, said that defining membership this broadly &#8220;created a vast and unknowable body of potential members that goes beyond any reasonable limit &hellip; not like any actual membership classification created by any actual tribe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two justices and Professor Benjamin were not just addressing abstract legal issues. Using the spurious definition of Native Hawaiian, the Akaka bill would allow a vast and unknowable number of persons, many of whom have surely never been to Hawai&rsquo;i, to participate in carving a separate government out of the state of Hawai&rsquo;i while excluding from even participating in the process 80 percent of the citizens who now call Hawai&rsquo;i home.</p>
<p>The Akaka bill does not set any limits on the extent of sovereignty that can be negotiated under Section 8 of the bill. For example, the state Legislature could grant the broad spectrum of powers that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs demanded in 1993, including powers to levy taxes, adopt ordinances, administer justice, share control of national parks and collect market rent for the military&rsquo;s use of ceded lands.</p>
<p>The bill would allow only Native Hawaiians to vote on the organic governing documents that define the powers and limitations of the new government. Implementation of the transfers of public lands, natural resources, governmental power and authority and civil and criminal jurisdiction to the new government only requires the approval of the political branches of the state and federal government.</p>
<p>The bill does not require the prior consent of the people of Hawai&rsquo;i, or even their subsequent ratification of these potentially huge changes to the state and the lives, liberty and property of all its citizens.</p>
<p>Since the avowed purpose of the bill&rsquo;s promoters is to protect existing race-based entitlements from attack under the U.S. Constitution, it is not likely that the new government&rsquo;s charter will include due process or equal protection clauses. Without those, the Native Hawaiian government would be free to discriminate between persons, even its own citizens, as its leaders see fit. Native Hawaiians themselves would be wise to consider the examples of recognized Indian tribes who arbitrarily oust disfavored tribe members and confiscate their properties.</p>
<p>In 1959, after a 94 percent vote in favor of statehood, Congress promised in the Admission Act that the state of Hawai&rsquo;i would consist of all the major islands and that its constitution would always be republican in form and not repugnant to the Constitution of the U.S. and the principles of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>Congress now proposes to break up and give away much of the state, without the consent of the people of Hawai&rsquo;i, and transfer it to a brand new government commissioned as the representative governing body of the Native Hawaiian people, a vast and unknowable body of potential members, without even any effort to obtain their consent. This whole enterprise is repugnant to the founding principles of both the United States and the Kingdom of Hawai&rsquo;i, whose constitution began: &#8220;God hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on Earth in unity and blessedness.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Cut Hawaii loose and regard them as a sovereign nation.</p>
<p>That courtesy should be extended to any other area of the US that wants to secede as an independent nation.</p>
<p>If we do all this in an orderly and peaceful fashion,  violent conflicts can be avoided.  That would be the intelligent thing to do.</p>
<p>But that will never happen.  Have these corrupt power mongers ever did anything intelligently when they could see that by being in the opposition a dollar could be made?  Of course not.  Stupidity, greed, and a quest for power, will continue on as standard operating procedure.  </p>

		<p>The sensible solution: retain Pearl Harbor as a US territory/military installation and let the rest of the island revert back to the Kingdom of Hawaii.  The whites can come to the US.  The Nisei can go to Japan.  It was rather underhanded the way we got Hawaii.  The only way to hold a conquered territory is for the conquerors to vastly out number the natives through settlement OR maintain a military/apartheid presence OR eliminate all the natives.  Nothing else really works.  It is time to say Aloha!<br>

		<p>What else can I add? Why should a group of volcanic islands, thousands of miles away from North America, be part of the United States?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all in favor of complete independence for Hawaii. Remove them from the Union and let them go their own way. It&rsquo;ll set some wonderful precedents for the rest of us.</p>

		<p>Hawaii is a tax sink.  We certainly no longer need it for military purposes.  Let it go.  Within ten years the Japanese all be carrying sidearms and the Hawaiian native-types will be begging for jobs and keeping their heads down.  Within fifty years the nativess will be confined to theme parks.  Also and unfortunately,  within fifty years, the natural heritage of Hawaii will be found in scroungy little museums and there will be wall-to-wall condos.</p>

		<p>I think it is interesting how &#8220;Rightist radicals&#8221; like the posters at AR seems to understand the issue of sovereignty much better than the leftists do. Perhaps the assertion that leftism is really Fascism in disguise is true? Who but a Fascist would oppose a desire to live free of foreign influence and control, as the Hawaiians want? Who but a Fascist would support repression of ethnicity?<br>
It seems the most important of all the freedoms is that of association. Without it freedom of speech amounts to nothing more than freedom to taunt and run. And without the Right, freedom of association would be neutered. What, if not a desire to kill that freedom, is educational &#8220;integration&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; all about? I think now more than at any time in our history we are frightened of the equivalent of the 2 AM &#8220;knock on the door&#8221; emblematic of Stalinism. <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m all for divesting the US of Hawaii.  The only hitch is that Hawaiians are American citizens.  Same problem with Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>A mechanism needs to be created for Hawaiians to irreversibly renounce their US citizenship in exchange for a share of federal property on the islands or some other lump-sum settlement.  Otherwise, it&rsquo;s win-win for them.  They enjoy any benefits of independence and can always bail to the Mainland if things go south.</p>

		<p>Reply to Paul at # 11:</p>
<p>Give Both Hawaii and P.R. its full independence. ANY American citizen living there has a one year &#8220;grace-period&#8221; to relocate to the USA. After that date all people living there have their citizenship status automatically revoked. They become Hawaiians and Peurto Ricans.</p>

		<p>Why is Hawaii even a state? It was, as I understand it, taken in a rather underhanded way. It is not a part of the North American continent. </p>
<p>Could it be that maybe the government and the powers that be understand that as our power as a nation weakens, and petroleum based products become ever scarcer, AND lets not forget the growing power of China, that maybe, just maybe, it is time to gradually let go of a place far from the USA that is not really a part of our country? </p>
<p>Finally, as the USA becomes a nation where whites are a minority, do you really think that non-whites who are replacing us really care if Hawaii is a state? Do you really think they are going to claim Hawaii as a state?</p>

		<p>Let Hawaii and Puerto Rico become sovereign. But THEN, all Hawaiians and Puerto Ricans go back to their homeland. Right? You know that will not happen. About as many Hawaiians live in the 48 contiguous states as live in Hawaii proper! And the U.S. Constitution does guarantee a republican form of government to each state. You would not have that here? It seems that a bunch of the &#8220;natives&#8221; are ready to use force. So far have not but there is a threat. This King long ago that united the islands did so using brute military force and massacre of anyone that opposed him! AND THIS KING WAS NOT ABOVE USING WHITE MANS WEAPONS THAT THE TUTELAGE OF WHICH WAS TAUGHT TO THE &#8220;NATIVES&#8221; BY OTHER WHITE MEN!! </p>
