<h1>Prison Damage Extensive</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Valarie Honeycutt Spears and Karla Ward, Lexington (Kentucky) Herald-Leader, August 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Extensive damage from multiple fires set Friday during rioting at Northpoint Training Center is forcing the transfer of 700 of the prison&rsquo;s 1,200 inmates to other facilities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prison spokeswoman Mendalyn Cochran said the inmates have been compliant since rioting was quelled Friday night at the medium-security prison about 5 miles north of Danville in Boyle County.</p>
<p>Officials declined to discuss the reason behind the incident, saying only that they are investigating it and confirming the prison has been under lockdown since Tuesday, when 10 to 15 Hispanic inmates assaulted a black inmate and white inmate. According to the prison&rsquo;s Web site, 57 percent of its 1,200 inmates are white, 40 percent are black and 3 percent are other races.</p>
<p>During the riot, the inmates set fire to a number of buildings. Cochran said six buildings  &mdash;  the kitchen, multipurpose area, sanitation, visitation area, canteen and medical services  &mdash;  were total losses. The rioting stopped after a Kentucky State Police special response team fired tear gas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The prison is a state-run medium-security facility. It has fences, which minimum-security prisons typically do not. And unlike maximum-security facilities that usually house prisoners in single cells, Northpoint puts more than one inmate in a cell, Cochran said.</p>
<p>The union that represents employees at the prison  &mdash;  the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Kentucky  &mdash;  issued a news release Saturday night attributing some of the blame for the riots to underfunding of equipment and training for staff at the prison. The group said in the release that the employees lacked working radios. State officials could not be reached for comment.</p>

		<p>This article confirms that it was a race riot, but it didn&rsquo;t take that for me to figure it out before hand.  The reason I knew it was racial is because state correctional authorities wouldn&rsquo;t say what caused the rioting, in the initial news reports.  When they don&rsquo;t say, it&rsquo;s race.</p>

		<p>  Ok, so they burned down alot of the facility. Since this prison does have walls to keep them from escaping, house them in tents on the grounds of the prison. Do not give them any means of heating their tents. Feed them once a day at noon. No television, no radio, no gym equipment. Make it another Andersonville prison.</p>

		<p>When I read about this incident in the newspaper, I thought to myself, &#8220;I wonder if there is some racial component to this incident. Guess I&rsquo;ll have to wait to read about it on AMREN.&#8221; And sure enough&hellip;</p>
<p>Expect the media (and even the authorities) to keep the inside story about this hush-hush, as they always do. The real take-away from this will of course be &#8220;underfunding of equipment and training for staff at the prison.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There aught to be some legal redress when a government paid spokesman deliberately distort racial information. </p>

		<p>Back in about the 1820s, there was a prison riot in Washington, DC.  The Commandant of Marines, not willing to miss out on any action I suppose, personally led 30 (Thirty!) Marines, armed with muzzle-loading muskets to the prison and gave the inmates an ultimatum: Back to your cells in five minutes or we fire.  The hundreds of prisoners laughed, knowing that after the first volley, they could easily overrun the handful of men with their empty weapons.  After four minutes of staring at the unflinching Marines, a few of the prisoners got nervous about being in the front row, and tried to wriggle their way deeper into the mob, starting a panicked rush to the cells.  </p>
<p>Of course today, men with M-16s wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about empty weapons.  </p>

<p>Right, exactly, that is what the convicts were thinking about when they rioted. The staff is not trained well enough, under funded, and lacks working radios. That is what the rioters had on their minds as they rioted. NO, they are just bad people acting badly as is their true and basic nature.</p>

		<p>It makes no sense that the prison system does not segregate the inmates by race.  Why can&rsquo;t people stop being so spineless and address this issue?  The number one concern in a prison facility should be for the safety of the staff and the incarcerated.   That this happened should be of no surprise to anyone.  </p>
<p>Segregation promotes peace.</p>
