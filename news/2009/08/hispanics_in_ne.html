<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tulane Medical Center officials note that they serve many Hispanics and, with language interpretation available for years at the downtown ER, don&rsquo;t know how the service breakdown reported by Ramirez could have happened. But the immigrant&rsquo;s experiences sound quite familiar to advocates for Hispanics in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Ramirez is one of large numbers of Hispanics  &mdash;  many of them drawn to the area by rebuilding jobs after Hurricane Katrina  &mdash;  who say they face several hurdles in obtaining medical care.</p>
<p><b>Vulnerable population</b></p>
<p>Like other working-class or low-income people, immigrant Hispanics are troubled by limited public transit options and lack of money for out-of-pocket fees. But they face additional problems that arguably make them the metro area&rsquo;s most vulnerable population, medically speaking: language barriers, exceptionally low rates of medical insurance coverage, and their own anxiety in providing personal information to medical providers  &mdash;  out of fear that it could lead to closer scrutiny of their legal status in America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Jaime Bustamante, medical director of an international services department at Ochsner Foundation Hospital, said emergency rooms are rife with Hispanic patients who, lacking any relationship with a doctor, appear with urgent and nonurgent needs. Some of them are undocumented, and they require a sophisticated response, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As of 2007, about 9 percent of Jefferson Parish residents and 4 percent of Orleans Parish residents identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino, according to sample surveys by the U.S. Census Bureau. But experts say such surveys don&rsquo;t account for many undocumented Hispanic workers and their relatives.</p>
<p><b>Lost in translation</b></p>
<p>The most prevalent obstacle for Spanish speakers seeking medical care is the language barrier. This gap is frequently seen at the front desk of a hospital or on the phone when someone tries to book an appointment  &mdash;  and is cut off immediately because the receptionist doesn&rsquo;t understand them.</p>
<p>Beyond the front desk, access to trained medical interpreters also is a major hurdle as patients try to explain their needs in Spanish. Although many facilities have bilingual staff members, experts say that&rsquo;s not the same as having an interpreter who specializes in conveying the patient&rsquo;s needs to the physician or nurse.</p>
<p>Among seven major hospitals in the metro area with emergency rooms, four offer medical interpreters on site, at least during regular office hours. The remaining three rely on an interpreter phone line. But miscommunication is a risk with such phone lines, and they prevent more nuanced exchanges between patients and doctors, some say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Insurance scarce</b></p>
<p>In addition to the language barrier, a lack of medical insurance poses a challenge, for medical providers as well as patients. It is a national problem: According to an analysis of 2008 census data by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Urban Institute, Hispanics comprise 15 percent of the population but make up 32 percent of the total uninsured population in the United States. And health officials say such numbers ring true in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Also, many Hispanics in New Orleans work in transient construction jobs that typically do not offer medical insurance. Out-of-pocket fees usually charged by clinics, even on a sliding scale, prompt many to avoid preventive care visits.</p>
<p>Even when Hispanic patients find out about free or low-cost clinics that have bilingual staff members  &mdash;  as in the case of Common Ground and Daughters of Charity clinics  &mdash;  transportation is a hurdle. Many immigrants do not have a valid driver&rsquo;s license or a car and must rely on public transit services that remain drastically reduced from pre-Katrina levels.</p>
<p>Many undocumented Hispanics, meanwhile, view health workers as authority figures and fear that their personal information could be reported to immigration officials  &mdash;  perhaps leading to deportations. Health workers say the fear is unjustified; nevertheless, it is common for Hispanics new to the area to provide false identification or incorrect addresses to health care providers. And that gets in the way of communication about follow-up treatment.</p>

		<p>Illegal aliens are invaders. They have no right to anything, including health care. They should be shot on sight. &#8220;they require a sophisticated response, he said.&#8221; This Hispanic doctor imparts this piece of wisdom. I would give them a sophisticated response. First I would shoot them, then I would display their bodies in Hispanic areas with a sign in Spanish that said: &#8221; I am illegal. Therefore I am dead.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I can sympathise fully with their plight.</p>
<p>I mean the hurdles of life are so extreme in this country.</p>
<p>For example I need somewhere to live, but whether I rent or buy I have to come up with money for rent or mortgage every month. seriously EVERY MONTH. Not once in a while or when I feel like it but EVERY SINGLE MONTH.</p>
<p>Then I have to get to that job every day. If it&rsquo;s on a public transport route then i have to come up with fare every time I travel. If it&rsquo;s not I have to go by car, but then I have to get a license, then insurance, then obey the very strict rules of the road. </p>
<p>On top of all that hassle I have to do the job i&rsquo;m paid to do. If I want additional services such as medical coverage I have to pay for that too, then I have to pay extra if I ever want to use it. On top of all that I have to pay taxes on what I earn.</p>
<p>I tell you life in this country is hell. I wish I wasn&rsquo;t an illegal immigrant&hellip; Wait a second i&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Where do I sign up for Mexican citizenship? You know where I can just go to another country and complain that I don&rsquo;t get every little thing, provided to my own personal specifications.. for free. </p>
<p>Do I find it in Charley&rsquo;s chocolate bar along with the golden ticket? Does &#8220;USA&#8221; in Mexican translate to &#8220;shangrila&#8221;?</p>

New Orleans won&rsquo;t be Chocolate City for much longer. The &#8216;home of jazz&rsquo; will quickly become the home of mariachi. </p>
<p>Are people so blind that they don&rsquo;t see the setup? First they pretend all they want to do is get a job. Next thing you know they&rsquo;re DEMANDING privileges not even given to the native born.</p>
<p>How do you fight suicidal stupidity? Telling the truth doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any affect.</p>

		<p>If I lived in Mexico I&rsquo;d have to speak Spanish.  Oh wait, I do speak Spanish!  I had to take 5 years of it to satisfy my high school and college credits.  ¡Hablo español mejor que la mayoría de los Mexicanos!  (I speak Spanish better than most Mexicans!)How come we can&rsquo;t have the same requirement for English?  I wish I had taken French or German instead then I could have taken a trip there and spoke English.</p>

<p>Yeah? Well, caucasians in California and about forty nine other states are hurting for health care to. How about that. You see I could write a story, just like Ambor Sandoval Griffin did, about American citizens that are hurting. Her story is about illegal aliens, because most hispanics in the U.S. ARE ILLEGAL ALIENS. You see, if Americans were informed, they&rsquo;d know that.</p>

		<p>I received this last week via email.  It&rsquo;s part of a &#8220;joke&#8221; but it applies to illegals:</p>
<p>COWS<br>
Is it just me, or does anyone else find it amazing that during the mad cow epidemic our government could track a single cow, born in Canada almost three years ago, right to the stall where she slept in the state of Washington?  And, they tracked her calves to their stalls. But they are unable to locate 11 million illegal aliens wandering around our country. Maybe we should give each of them a cow&hellip;<br>

I don&rsquo;t understand why we don&rsquo;t adopt the policies that Mexico has: if someone needs medical care and they are not citizens, they must pay before they receive care. period. </p>
<p>And even if this country continues to give medical care to illegals, at least triage: if it truly is life threatning, or contagious to the population at large, treat it; if not, adios amigo</p>

		<p>What I have heard from more than one person here in North Carolina is that the rich business owners in town actually have a big billboard south of the boarder telling them to COME HERE, to THIS town for jobs.  They are employed in the chicken plant.  Oh, and now the hospital is about to close, driven into bankruptcy from the non-paying illegals.  The worst of this is that the rich business owners are WHITE.</p>

<p>Yeah, and it couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer group of people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still too busy looking for The Great White Bigot  &mdash;  you know the one that causes all their poverty, indolence, lack of job skills (or even a desire to look for a job), and forces them to live in utter oppression in Section 8 housing and rely on the government for everything.  </p>
<p>This is what the media and academia repeatedly tell them so why should they bother wondering if/when &#8216;their&rsquo; city is being taken over by hispanics (which will happen quickly. as I saw in LA).  Those nice hispanics will continue to support blacks with food stamps, free housing, free medical care won&rsquo;t they?  They do understand blacks&rsquo; historic legacy of slavery and oppression under White rule, do they not?  Blacks will continue to receive favored status from the media and a pass from the government as to their high criminal rates, won&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>No, better to keep an eye out for The Great White Bigot.  After their city  &mdash;  hell, the entire state  &mdash;  is completely taken over, they&rsquo;ll do nothing except blame The Great White Bigot.  Yeah, blame him as hispanics violently cleanse blacks from their midst  &mdash;  as they&rsquo;re doing in LA.</p>

		<p>The major reason health care costs skyrocket every year is the fact that the cost of freeloading illegals is passed on to Americans in the form of increased costs.  </p>
<p>When are we going to remind government that it exists to server us and not the other way around?  The federal law that dictates free medical care for was intended to apply to poor American citizens and not to parasitic illegal aliens.  We must demand that the law be made clear and do it soon&hellip;<br>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanics are more trouble than they&rsquo;re worth&hellip;&#8221; What a novel idea. &#8216;s funny, but most Americans&hellip; at least those with a reasonable degree of intelligence found that truth out for themselves. Years ago. That that so-called cheap labor was far costlier in money and problems&hellip; than it could ever be worth. I know from a professional perspective, how prone the damned illegals are to make phony claims of on-the-job injuries, and to milk every last penny out of insurance companies and employers.</p>

<p>I live in Los Angeles too Bon.  It only took about 12 years, maybe 1985 to 1997.  Of course the Rodney King riots helped too.<br>
After that the real movers and shakers, not the politicians took over and saw to it that blacks were cleansed from their government and other jobs.  It&rsquo;s amazing.  The blacks just disappeared and hispanics took their place in less than 15 years.<br>

<p>I mean the hurdles of life are so extreme in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Etc., etc., blah, blah, blah,&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Think about the irony of your sarcasm.  One hundred years ago, most Americans lived on farms, did not pay rent or even a mortgage, although some were bound by the old share-cropping system.  And they were overwhelmingly white.  It was possible to home-stead and raise a fine family that could both go to school and work on the farm.  One could argue that this was the American Dream and the true high-water-mark in regards to independence and self-determination.  Historian Carrol Quigley once noted that it was in the 19th century, when the population was armed similarly to the military, that America had the most democracy.</p>
<p>But look what happened, some scammers (politicians) usurped the self-righteous feminist Temperance Movement, opened the way for growing organized crime.  Other scammers (politicians)found ways (for their friends) to make money by making end runs around rules government markets to produce the false riches of the 20s and eventually The Crash and resultant Great Depression.  Some politicians, in league with banks and corporations wanted to end the share-cropping and family farm culture, so used the event to grab up land.  Then, a convenient war came along to reshuffle the deck once again.  Few now remember what life was like back then, but the stories are out there if you look - as well as a few still-living witnesses.</p>
<p>So now, you are born and it is guaranteed that you will have to pay for the ground you were born on.  There is nowhere you can lay down and sleep without paying for it.  Think about that, you are born on this earth, but someone who got there before you is charging you to exist on it.  And it doesn&rsquo;t stop there, you need a home, and it is set up with forced costs.  The whole thing has progessed to the point that you need all sorts of things, a car, insurance, life insurance, other protection racket provisions and you can&rsquo;t even afford to die.  I mean you must pay funeral expenses.  In the U.S., it costs more for you to die than anywhere in the world.  Even dying has long been a mercenary enterprise in this, the supposedly greatest country in the world.  It has all progressed to the point that most &#8220;industry&#8221; in the U.S. is about how to entrap people with irresistable costs.  It is a ruthless game aimed at making you and me a sort of slave from cradle to grave.  I don&rsquo;t think posters like you can see this or that there is something alien to actual human existence to it.  It makes us all nothing more than cogs in a wheel, or perhaps just the oil.</p>
<p>I just watched a great old movie called, &#8220;Lonely are the Brave.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s Kirk Douglas&rsquo; favorite movie.  It is about the death of the individual in America, using the Closing of the West as it&rsquo;s theme.</p>
<p>I feel good when I pay my bills and I think we ought to pay for what we use, or replace it.  But I am not sure how proud I am of the system of civilization we have today, as you seem to be.</p>
<p>This is why I often write on Amren that whites need to learn to farm again, starting with home gardens, etc.  Because when this house of cards falls apart and the scramble begins, it will be these non-whites who will prevail.  They will prevail because they are still close to the land and understand basic survival, while most whites are pumped up on their personal ideology of their rights and surety of their continuing wealth and dominance.</p>
<p>Better think twice - and change.<br>
