<h1>Harlem Business Owner Charles (Gus) Augusto Opens Shop Day After Fatally Shooting Two Robbers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barry Paddock, Alison Gendar and Corky Siemaszko, New York Daily News, August 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Harlem businessman who blasted a gang of robbers with a shotgun as they terrorized his staff said Friday, &#8220;I had no choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were probably going to work us all over,&#8221; Charles (Gus) Augusto told the Daily News. &#8220;You know me  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m not going to take anything lying down.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Augusto, 72, insisted he told the gunman who&rsquo;d just pistol-whipped his clerk to clear out, but the bandit just wouldn&rsquo;t listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sad I couldn&rsquo;t talk him out of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m sad there&rsquo;s mothers and fathers with no sons today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Augusto said he has some idea what they must be feeling because his son, Charles, killed himself with a gun a dozen years ago, and &#8220;the pain never goes away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t feel like a hero,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I would have felt like a hero if I could have talked that kid into going home.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The tragedy began at 3 p.m. Thursday when four thieves burst into the Blue Flame, a restaurant-supply business on W.125th St. near Amsterdam Ave.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sitting here minding my own business and they come in,&#8221; [Augusto] said. &#8220;Next thing I look, and there&rsquo;s a kid standing there with a gun pointed at [secretary Dorothy Hunt] wanting to know where the cash was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police identified the gunman as James Morgan, 29, of Manhattan, a convicted drug dealer. The other robbers  &mdash;  all of them 21 years old  &mdash;  were unarmed.</p>
<p>While one suspect beat Hall, Morgan waved his gun at Augusto and Hunt and demanded, &#8220;Where&rsquo;s the cash?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked him, &#8216;Why don&rsquo;t you just put your gun down and go home, and we&rsquo;ll forget about this thing? Someone&rsquo;s gonna get hurt. There&rsquo;s no money  &mdash;  you&rsquo;re gonna get in trouble. You&rsquo;re wasting your time.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Augusto said for a second he thought he&rsquo;d gotten through to him. But then another robber told Morgan to ignore Augusto and resumed pounding Hall.</p>
<p>It was then that Augusto reached for the shotgun he had bought two decades ago  &mdash;  and hoped he&rsquo;d never have to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were beating up on JB, so I shot them,&#8221; Augusto said.</p>
<p>Morgan and Raylin Footmon of Manhattan were killed, police said.</p>
<p>Bernard Witherspoon of Manhattan and Shamel McCloud of Queens staggered outside the store and were nabbed by cops. They were treated at St.Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and have been charged with robbery.</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s mother insisted Friday, &#8220;He was a good man and a wonderful son&#8221; who worked as a construction worker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The brother of the other dead man said Footmon was &#8220;a decent man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a good man. He was loved and he loved a lot of people,&#8221; said the man who refused to give his name.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the Blue Flame, Hall, 35, said the foursome got what they deserved  &mdash;  and had nothing but praise for his brave boss.</p>

		<p>The news is a never ending string of stories about blacks with guns committing crimes. All these crimes lead to a new round of calls for gun control. Would there really be any movement for gun control if it weren&rsquo;t for black criminality? I&rsquo;m aware of the Columbine style crimes, but they are an anomoly. The gun crimes highlight racial differences in criminality.</p>

		<p>So typical.  Gun waving thug shot down.  Thugs mother crys &#8220;murder&#8221;.  You know what?  His mothers attitude scares me more than his gun waving and when you get right down to it, his behavior is probably a relfection of her values and the  atitutdes that she imparted to him.  By rights she should have been the one kissing the floor.</p>

		<p>In the article:<br>
&#8220;He didn&rsquo;t have to shoot him in the back,&#8221; said the mom, who declined to give her name. &#8220;It was a homicide. It was murder. It&rsquo;s on his conscience.&#8221; </p>
<p>No, thug-spawner, it is on YOUR conscience for bringing so a low life nothing into this world.  Thankfully he is out of it now and can&rsquo;t harm anyone else.  </p>

		<p>Augusto is a hero in my book. The dead thugs got what they deserved. The mother of the dead gunman practically bestowed divinity on her thug son. I&rsquo;m surprised she didn&rsquo;t say Morgan raised Michael Jackson from the dead, fed five thousand starving Ethiopians on two catfish and five loaves of pita bread and turned water into muscatel. It always sickens me how Bantus will speak in glowing terms about Bantu criminals and low-lifes like they were saints.  I don&rsquo;t think any other race on planet Earth mollycoddles and worships its criminals like Bantus do.  </p>

		<p>     The perps were candidates for sainthood. The Dems want to take away your guns. I heard a rumor that Senators Boxer and Feinstein have concealed-carry permits. Can anyone substantiate this for me ? What is good for the goose is NOT good for the gander. What I can&rsquo;t understand is why so many Jews are for gun control. See Chuck Schumer. If the Jews in Germany were armed to the teeth maybe there wouldn&rsquo;t have been a Holocaust. They think it can&rsquo;t happen here. Wait until the Moslems take over.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how when a white guy commits a crime most people say he was a little strange, or messed up.  When a black guy beats the snot out of someone, robs them, rapes them, and/or kills them, they are always good people, who loved everyone, who would never hurt a fly.  The only good people involved in this story are the ones who defended themselves against the animals who attacked them.  I feel a little safer knowing two of them are off the street and in the ground.</p>

		<p>Irrespective of the racial/ethnic identity of either the robber or the intended victim, when a declared would-be armed robber lies dead on the floor of his intended victim&rsquo;s shop, just where is the wrong? For that matter, if a declared would-be rapist lies dead at his intended victimn&rsquo;s feet, once again, just where is the wrong? The salient fact, beside which considerations of racial/ethnic identity are completely irrelevant, is the character of the intended criminal act.</p>

		<p>Well at least if the robbers caused any damage to the shop, the owner can sleep soundly knowing that if he needs to borrow any funds to facilitate repairs, he can safely borrow from a black owned bank without getting overcharged or otherwise taken advantage of like he would at a crooked white owned bank.</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m with the clerk   &mdash;   these thugs deserve no sympathy   &mdash;   none. If they were such great guys, why were they robbing a business, and beating up someone who had done them no harm? Thanks, Mr. Augusto, for doing what many other owners and clerks have not had the nerve, or maybe the gun at hand, to do to those who come in as bold as brass to pull a robbery, armed, and with no concern whatever about innocent people getting hurt or killed.</p>
<p> That Mr. Augusto is just as decent a guy as his clerk said he was is proved by his obvious deep regret at having to pull the trigger of that shotgun. But he did the right thing. If someone invades your business or your home with evil intent, you have the right to do whatever it takes to eliminate that threat. </p>

		<p>This is yet another example of inner-city blacks driven to criminal acts by lack of opportunity.  It is clear that the perpetrators were kindly youths, possessed of sunny dispositions and full of noble intentions.</p>
<p>What appeared to be an armed robbery and a violent assault was clearly a cry for help from these emotionally scarred and tortured young men, who doubtless were trying only to provide for their families by beating Ms. Hall and threatening to kill her and the brutal shotgun-wielding shopkeeper.</p>

		<p>As &#8220;wild west&#8221; as this incident played out, it was the right course of action to take. Mr. Augusto gave them a chance to leave, even after they had beaten one man and threatened the other employees with a weapon. We in fact ARE living in a &#8220;wild west&#8221; of sorts, and the only way to have a chance at survival is to meet force with force. I think the standard advisement to just quietly hand over the goods and do what ever the nice robber says has in fact emboldened criminals to rob more as they know most will offer no resistance. And unfortunately for some, total compliance will mean the robber may take extra liberties, i.e.: rape and/or murder, or a brutal beating. We must show the criminal element that it&rsquo;s just not worth trying to rob someone as they could die in the attempt. I bet the crime rate would drastically drop if people would only follow the most basic of instincts, survival. Seems the majority, through social constructs and brainwashing through media/schools, have turned into sheep awaiting the random act of violence upon their person. The police are an after the fact service, meaning they arrive after you&rsquo;re robbed/killed. They cannot protect you on a personal level unless they were to walk around with you everywhere you go, impossible. Thats the only thing a murderous attacking animal will respect, total and swift brute force. It&rsquo;s a shame but that&rsquo;s the society we all have to live, and try to survive in. </p>

<p><i> If someone invades your business or your home with evil intent, you have the right to do whatever it takes to eliminate that threat.</i> -W Engle</p>
<p>Here we run into a contradiction.  Do blacks have the same right as we do &#8220;to eliminate that threat&#8221;?  The modern movement by blacks to disarm blacks is just a continuation of a much older movement by whites to disarm blacks (even to the point of using the same political party), so for a long time in this country, the answer was &#8220;no, they don&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can think of only one case where a black homeowner used force on a white intruder, but it was a doozy: when Carl Rowan used Carl Jr&rsquo;s police pistol on some white teenage trespassers.  (This was more comic than tragic, as they&rsquo;d only come to &#8216;borrow&rsquo; the pool, and he merely grazed them.)  Hypocrisy aside (hypocrisy is legal), was Rowan in the right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be seeing a lot more &#8220;white-on-black&#8221; violent crime in the coming years, what with all those &#8220;white&#8221; Mexican and Central American changing ghettos into barrios.</p>

<p>I tell you people, if a couple of friends and myself burst into someone&rsquo;s business in such a violent manner in order to rob them, my mother would consider me an atrocious individual worthy of no respect or defence. I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d bother to go to the correctional facility to visit me either.</p>

<p>You can bet your bottom Pound Sterling that Mr. Augusto would be facing a long prison sentence if he defended himself with deadly force in formerly Great Britain. The British elites identify with the same &#8220;socially friendly elements&#8221; (criminals) that the NKVD/Cheka thugs let terrorize the political prisoners in the Gulag. </p>

		<p>gee vee,.. yes I heard the same thing about boxer and feinstein when I was in California, and you said exactly what I said,. THEY have the right to carry, but don&rsquo;t let anyone ELSE carry.</p>
<p>I read the comments attached the original article and they are overwhelmingly in favor of the man defending himself and his people.  This just goes to show me that just a small number of very vocal liberals are anti-gun.  And this article reminds me of the story of that woman who got snatched while walking in an isolated but considered &#8220;safe&#8221; area, AND she was talking on her cell phone.  Call me paranoid, but I would never walk alone and not be carrying and not be totally aware of what was around me.<br>
I always felt that I didn&rsquo;t want to be a statistic.  I would bet that woman is probably, unfortunately already murdered.</p>

		<p>I had a black mother bring her son over for a consult. He had been nabbed for having heroin, 11 packets full,in his school locker. I listened to the events and told her that my fee was 5 grand and all I would promise was that I would show up. She said I had the wrong idea. They had a public defender for him. She wanted me to sue the school for violating his rights by searching his locker without a warrant and tazing him as he tried to make a run for it.   <br>
     When I mentioned that maybe a 16 year old kid, 8th grader by the way,caught trafficking in smack might need some counseling or help; she said,&#8221; he doesn`t need any help. He`s a good boy.&#8221; Three years later he killed a 15 year old in a drive by and is now rotting away for the next 60 years. After he was sentenced she told the tv that he was a good boy who was always picked on by the cops.<br>
     The saddest part of this modern Gothic horror story is that she needed him so badly. He supported her and her three other children and 5 grand children by dealing. None of her children`s or grand children`s fathers ever paid a dime in child support, by being gone, dead, or in prison. I retired 6 months after he went to prison. That was the straw that broke the jack asses`s back, mine.<br>

<p>True, which is precisely why <a href="http://www.jpfo.org/" rel="nofollow">this Jewish pro-gun group</a> exists. In fact, nearly all the anti-gun laws on the books here are virtual clones of the Nazi anti-gun laws. (Note that I don&rsquo;t say &#8220;gun control,&#8221; because IMO the only valid definition of that phrase is &#8220;the ability to hit what you shoot at.&#8221;)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just glad that the NYPD has refused to charge him with anything. Although, some liberal DA will likely try to get him on not having the shotgun registered or something like that.</p>

		<p>THis article appeared in the latest issue of the NRA magazine. It&rsquo;s the proverbial happy ending except for the fact that only one perpetrator met his deserved fate.</p>
<p><br>
Ten college students were enjoying a birthday party at an off-campus apartment when two armed men burst through the door. Police say the intruders separated the men from the women and demanded their cell phones and money. That&rsquo;s when one of the male students took action, drawing his gun from a backpack and shooting at the suspect guarding the men. That suspect fled the apartment. The student then hurried to the women, where he found the second suspect about to commit a rape. He yelled for the girls to get down and fired several shots at the suspect, who jumped out the window and died nearby. &#8220;Apparently, [the dead suspect&rsquo;s] intent was to rape and murder us all,&#8221; said student Charles Bailey, &#8220;I think all of us are really cognizant of the fact that we could have all been killed.&#8221; (WSB-TV, Atlanta, GA, 05/04/09)</p>

		<p>&#8220;What I can&rsquo;t understand is why so many Jews are for gun control. See Chuck Schumer. If the Jews in Germany were armed to the teeth maybe there wouldn&rsquo;t have been a Holocaust. They think it can&rsquo;t happen here. Wait until the Moslems take over.&#8221;</p>
<p>The residents of the Warsaw Ghetto gave those Nazi bastards a pretty good going over until they were overwhelmed. </p>
<p>THe best home defense weapon is a shotgun. THe gauge doesn&rsquo;t matter. Anything from .410 to .12 gauge is fine. THe pump action is easy to use and doesn&rsquo;t jam as sometimes occurs with autoloaders. Sometimes the mere sound of a round being racked into the firing chamber is enough to scare off the less bold intruder.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sad I couldn&rsquo;t talk him out of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad there&rsquo;s mothers and fathers with no sons today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compare Augusto, <br>
 Con tutto rispetto, You did what you had to do. They sowed the wind and reaped the Whirlwind. As for the &#8220;fathers&#8221;? I&rsquo;d wager that they aren&rsquo;t around to mourn. IF there had been perahps they wouldn&rsquo;t have been trying to rob you.</p>

		<p>I know it happened in Harlem, but notice that the description of the robbers once again avoids any mention of race.</p>
<p>Any bets that would happen if the robbers were white?</p>

		<p>The only thing he might have done wrong is open shop next day, or even open up again at all. Of course his courage is to be commended, but that sort of notoriety might come back to visit him in the form of vengeance by the deceaseds&rsquo; lowlife gangsta homeboys coming &#8216;round to even up the score. After all, the dead man was such a good person, to hear his Momma tell it. I guess in Harlem pistol whipping innocent people is only a bad thing if you do it to White people.</p>

		<p><b>The brother of the other dead man said Footmon was &ldquo;a decent man.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>No, decent men don&rsquo;t rob people and physically assault them.  Decent men aren&rsquo;t drugdealers either. Sorry, lady.  Nice try.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a good man. He was loved and he loved a lot of people,&rdquo; said the man who refused to give his name.</p>
<p>Yes.  He was such a good man that he had a criminal record and chose to steal from hardworking, honest people.</p>
<p>Why in the black community can&rsquo;t they just say &#8220;he&rsquo;s a thug&#8221; or &#8220;he&rsquo;s a lowlife, he should have known better&#8221;?  Trust me, I have some people related to me that are criminals and have gotten in trouble with the law.  I feel sorry that they chose to dishonor themselves and to do something other than noble, honest, and legal ways to earn money.  Oh, I&rsquo;m white, too.</p>

		<p>Why is it that EVERY SINGLE TIME a black thug, gangbanger or criminal gets killed in the course of committing some violent or heinous crime the black community just falls all over themselves exalting how &#8220;wonderful&#8221; and &#8220;fine&#8221; a person he was? (Makes me wonder what a person must be like that blacks consider &#8220;bad&#8221;)? If a bunch of White thugs invaded and terrorized a White, Oriental or Black place and they get theirs&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t defend them. I would say they deserevd it and were bad guys. So would most other Whites I believe. Blacks just will not abandon their racial solidarity no matter what. </p>

The perps were candidates for sainthood. The Dems want to take away your guns. I heard a rumor that Senators Boxer and Feinstein have concealed-carry permits. Can anyone substantiate this for me ?</p>
<p>Absolutely true. I have known them both for more than 40 years.  Feinstein has been carrying since around 1965. They don&rsquo;t carry into the DC government buildings of course because of the metal detectors.  But Feinstein carries everywhere else even though her multi billionaire husband houses her in the very best neighborhoods.<br>

		<p>What amazed me about the story is what the store sold, commerical stoves, ovens, fryers, freezers etc.  It is not one of those restaurant supply stores that sell pots and pans, knives, dishes etc where people buy things for cash.</p>
<p>It sells  nothing but big ticket items, $5,000 and up stoves and bakery ovens.  What did the robbers think, that bakery owners walked in with $4,000 in 20 dollar bills to buy a new oven?</p>
<p>It would be like going into a Mercedes dealership and expecting to find cash in the cash register as though the restaurant stove store was a 7-11.</p>

		<p>gee vee, when Frisco passed a law against handgun ownership, Mayor Dianne Feinstein turned in a .38 Special revolver, to appease those who pointed out her hypocrisy.  No doubt she kept her more expensive weapons.</p>
