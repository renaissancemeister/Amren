<h1>Illegal Immigrants Total 3 Percent of Serious-Crime Arrests in Prince William County</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Sherfinski, Washington Examiner, August 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 3 percent of individuals arrested for violent crimes in Prince William County last year were illegal immigrants, according to data released Tuesday.</p>
<p>Of nearly 2,000 people arrested for the most violent crimes  &mdash;  which include murder, rape and aggravated assault  &mdash;  from March to December 2008, 3.4 percent were in the country illegally, according to an interim report on the county police department&rsquo;s policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The county&rsquo;s highly publicized crackdown on illegal immigrants was implemented smoothly by the county&rsquo;s police department but has had a mixed effect on crime and the community&rsquo;s perception of the department, according to the report presented to the county Board of Supervisors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Thomas Guterbock, director of the Center for Survey Research, estimated that several thousand illegal immigrants left when the policy was enacted, but added that the reasons for the exodus were not clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unclear if the modest outflow was attributable to the immigration enforcement policy (that is, people getting arrested and turned over to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]), fear of the policy or the highly publicized anti-immigration sentiment voiced in the controversy, the economic downturn or all four,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Prince William Police Chief Charlie Deane said his department was committed to carrying out the policy in a fair and lawful manner, but added he was concerned with findings from the study that showed a drop in police satisfaction and trust from the county&rsquo;s African-American and Hispanic communities.</p>
<p>Ninety-five percent of Asians and 93 percent of whites were satisfied with overall police performance, compared with 84 percent for African-Americans and 73 percent for Hispanics, the report said, based on a 2008 survey. Eight-three percent of whites were satisfied that the police department treats everyone fairly by ethnic and racial group, compared with 80 percent of Asians, 62 percent of African-Americans and 49 percent of Hispanics.<br/>

<p>They left out the fifth and most likely option. Businesses employing illegals got scared and laid them off. Without jobs, they left on their own.</p>

<p>The black and Hispanic percentages would have been more favorable if the police would agree to stop arresting them for committing crimes. </p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the big rub.  &#8220;How can we be satisfied with the police when they don&rsquo;t believe us when we say we&rsquo;re innocent?&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think one of the biggest issues with illegal immigrants, and one that seems to be sequestered in the media, is the alarming amount of drunk drivers. The US has worked for years, constantly drumming into our heads about the hazards of drinking and driving, and rightly so. However, south of the border must not have been as public-service oriented as illegals are getting drunk, often receiving several arrests for same, and continue to drive. The upshot is that many drunk driving illegals keep driving until they kill someone then promptly run back home to avoid prosecution. This is a travesty to law abiding citizens and has destroyed the modicum of safety the public driver has enjoyed, after a long fought, and ongoing psa campaign. I&rsquo;ve also noticed many of our Mexican neighbors do not know their right from their left in regard to using turn signals. This is also a potential for disaster when piloting a two ton hunk of  steel. Well, at least they tried to use the turn signal as opposed to many of our own inconsiderate drivers.</p>

		<p>We must remember that our police forces are seldom able to actually determine the legal status of immigrant. Thus, the 3% figure given above is surely a gross underestimate. Unfortunately, here in Arizona, where I live, the figure is probably closer to 75%. </p>
