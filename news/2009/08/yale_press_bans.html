<p>{snip} The book, &#8220;The Cartoons That Shook the World,&#8221; [by Jytte Klausen, published by Yale University Press] should not include the 12 Danish drawings that originally appeared in September 2005. What&rsquo;s more, they suggested that the Yale press also refrain from publishing any other illustrations of the prophet that were to be included, specifically, a drawing for a children&rsquo;s book; an Ottoman print; and a sketch by the 19th-century artist Gustave Doré of Muhammad being tormented in Hell, an episode from Dante&rsquo;s &#8220;Inferno&#8221; that has been depicted by Botticelli, Blake, Rodin and Dalí.</p>

		<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for liberal Yale to turn chicken when being confronted by Muslim outrage. For so long, Yale and other schools kept trumpeting how Islam was the religion of peace, and anyone who questioned its tenets was racist, and intolerant. Now the Ivy League and other schools have gotten a dose of their own medicine.</p>
<p>Just like Harvard, who invited Iran&rsquo;s Ahmedinjad to speak, only to see his police force bust open the heads of Iranian dissidents, a few months later.  </p>

		<p>  Hardly surprising. Like most liberals, they disparage the police until they need them, and the military as long as they feel safe. Freedom of the press means nothing if Islamic terror tactics make people self-censor. The left is, as usual, full of fecal matter. Leftists love to trumpet their collective cowardice as  &#8220;tolerance&#8221;, or &#8220;respect for others&rsquo; feelings&#8221;. Publish and be damned! Show the world how the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; plans to deal with dissent. When enough liberals get their head cut off, they will begin to re-assess their positions.</p>

		<p>Ivy League PC censorship makes a joke out of the boasting about academic freedom we hear at commencements and publications by colleges.  Muslims have no concept of freedom. We are diametrically opposed to them. We are not at war with &#8220;radical&#8221; Islam. We are at war with Islam and its fellow travellers, some of whom aren&rsquo;t even Muslim. The war is and will be unpleasant. </p>
<p>And our education system teaches falsely that everyone and every religion is &#8220;equal&#8221;. This is a determined and ruthless enemy. We are weak and vacillating. </p>
<p>The prospect of Western victory over this awful &#8220;religion&#8221; is minimal.</p>

		<p>If Islam truly is a &#8220;religion of peace,&#8221; what is there to fear? The United States is the world&rsquo;s foremost authority on freedom, and yet an American publisher chooses to self-censor? </p>
<p>The left is quick to scorn and ridicule anyone who dares run counter to the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; mantra&hellip;until the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; seems poised to cut their heads off on YouTube. </p>
<p>Reality is the most accurate arbiter of liberal ideology. No doubt Mr. Donatich felt the cold shiver of an Islamic target on his back rather than the open arms of a peaceful religion. </p>

		<p>It should be fully understood that this is a race issue and not a religious issue.  The whole bizarre spectacle of leftists championing the mass immigration of fundamentally illiberal Muslims shows just how psychotic their hatred of white people and the West are: they favor anything that will help exterminate the West and its people even if it means a Gotterdammerung for themselves and their beliefs.   They literally are insane genocidal racists, nuttier than the Nazis (who after all only attempted genocide against other peoples, not their own) and just as obsessed with eliminating their target group.   Conservatism is a failure, and will always be a failure,   because it persists in pretending that the proper way to confront genocidal racism is with a revision of the tax-code.    And make no mistake,  the creatures at the top of the Republican Party and the Conservative movement fully understand that we&rsquo;re witnessing the demise of Western civilization, they believe pretty much what the readers of this site believe because reality is what it is and there is no proof that the mass invasion is advancing conservatism or making life better in any way (quite the opposite).    They are upper class collaborationist crooks, in it for the buck,   who believe their money and specialness will protect them in the coming Brazilianization of the country - to hell with the nation or their constituents,  what&rsquo;s in it for them.  </p>

<p>Interesting how modern conservatism has adopted a form of vulgar Marxism in which economic issues determine all. Thus, as long as the conservatives can get their tax cut, and put a <i>Real republican</i>  in the White house, they can care less about the cultural and demographic issues which are causing the disintegration of America.<br>

		<p>To Californian:</p>
<p>Your opinion is a sound one. The same Republicans who denounced cotton-pickin&rsquo; slavery in the 19th century, and planted the seeds for the Civil War in order to save the Union, have no problems with inviting Mexicans to pick the crops of their agribusiness friends in the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>
<p>In the link, &#8220;The Ruins of Detroit&#8221;, a writer castigates Republican politicians for not addressing the damage done to our cities by Bantus and mestizos, while raging about communism in some rice-paddy republic in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>And it was Bush, who not only sogned McCain-Feingold into law, but also said &#8220;Muslims salute the American flag&#8221;, right after the 9-11-01 bombings.</p>
