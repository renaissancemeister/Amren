<h1>Race Riot &#8216;Cover-Up&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Sun (London), August 17, 2009, page 25</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A police force slammed for being politically correct tried to COVER UP a weekend race riot.</p>
<p>More than 60 Asians were said to have stormed The White House pub where families gathered after a football game.</p>
<p>Steve Dann, 26, who was hit by a bottle in the incident, said: &#8220;There was blood everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several people were beaten up as terrified women and kids fled.</p>
<p>But Bedfordshire police, who sent in 100 officers, said the Luton attack &#8220;did not warrant comment.&#8221;</p>

<p>How can they possibly think they can get away with such a blatant cover-up. </p>
<p>Thank god for the internet. Without it we would be subject to the daily diet of spoonfed news that these so called journalists rate a &#8220;suitable&#8221; for us mere mortals. No wonder newspapers are all going down the toilet. Not worth the paper they&rsquo;re printed on.</p>

		<p>It gives me a very uneasy feeling that the editorial gate-keepers are routinely choosing to withold reporting of the latest racial riots in France, Sweden, and Britain. </p>
<p>It is transparently obvious that they are willfully trying to create a false reality, with baseless reports of alleged &#8216;right-wing extremism&rsquo; on the rise, and actual race disturbances with injuries and property damage played down.   </p>

<p>Look at UK sports teams, all non white.</p>

<p>The same is being done in Hungary. The PC media with very few exceptions does not report race riots that are going on in the country .: <br>
the gipsy (the so called roma) population is in a state of nearly revolting, in some areas the gipsies even organised gipsy patrols agains alleged racially motivated murders. In some villages 20-30 gipsy males are patroling the streats, armed with axe and hatchet and stopping every car passing. The police did nothing so far to stop this racial agression against the white population. </p>
<p>The media does not report the riots, instead they write and talk about fake race crimes against the gipsy population. (all of that commited by gipsy against gipsy or set up but being reported as white on gipsy crime) </p>

		<p>I think this is a good article, but it does something that the diehard politically collect British press ALWAYS does (that, frankly, annoys the heck out of me): they use the word &#8220;Asian&#8221; all the time.  Just to let you guys know, when the British use the word &#8220;Asian&#8221; to describe a racial group when something goes wrong (drugs, criminality, dysfunctionality, terrorism, race riots, etc.)-they really mean PAKISTANI/BANGLADESHI MUSLIM-the people who, along with the Blacks, cause (I would estimate) &gt;95% of the crime in the UK!  </p>
<p>Just thought you guys should know that-so American readers don&rsquo;t think that the Japanese Yakuza, horny Korean college students, Hong Kong laundry cleaners, or for that matter Sikhs/Hindus are the &#8220;Asians&#8221; behind the social problems besetting the UK.</p>

		<p>I saw this story, along with video footage, which appeared briefly on UK TV but was not repeated or commented on again. Trying to find further news or updates has proved impossible within UK and this AMREN story is the first I have heard of since. There is no doubt whatsoever that the mainstream media simply censor such reports especially when muslims are involved in attacking White English people. This is certainly only one of many similar reports that become buried, presumably following government diktats. Only during the past few weeks have official comments on British troop deaths in Afghanistan consistently state that the UK is helping to &#8216;keep the streets of Britain safe from terror&rsquo; as well as ensuring that the current presidential election is able to proceed without taliban interference. Well, that is proving just as futile as witnessing that mugabe was elected fairly! No-one in UK is fooled into thinking that the taliban in afghanistan is operating without the military support of many pakistanis pouring across the leaky border, many of them born in the northern towns of Britain and dedicated to the islamification of UK. Meanwhile our wonderful labour government challenge nearly all claims for compensation for horrific injuries sustained by our soldiers saying they must choose which three of multiple injuries they may claim for, and only one is compensated 100%, the next is paid at a discounted rate as is the third. Further injuries are ignored. Of course, we are now instructed that our Christian English women must dress in islamic swimming garb to preserve the modesty of muslim women. Somehow, things simply do not make sense, especially our labour government which is destined to certain doom, perhaps, and thankfully, forever. Unless they fix the next general election, which is not impossible.</p>

		<p>The Murdoch owned Sun is the worst paper. The far left always attacks it for criticisng immigration and for being &#8216;nationalistic&rsquo; but this is far from the truth. They sanitise these positions for the elite by criticisng elements of immigration and multiculturalism whilst maintaning a final editorial position that these are good things and that we just need more assimilation. Also big time neo-con when it comes to foreign policy too.<br>
At least we know where the BBC and Gaurdian are coming from, the Murdoch press (Times, Sun) are wolfs in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.</p>

<p>Yes, with the nauseating developments that have happened in the last few decades, the British soldiers that helped the allies (and the wonderful Soviet Union) defeat Nazi Germany probably wondered why they bothered.</p>
<p>Regarding this article;<br>
1.Am I correct in assuming that in this context, &#8216;Asian&rsquo; means &#8216;Muslim?&rsquo;<br>
2. Does anyone out there know why this pub was targeted for such an attack? </p>
<p>As usual, this is completely insane, and as usual I&rsquo;m not suprised. I&rsquo;m not from the UK or the USA, but I read my news here on AmRen everyday. Everyone should know what we read here.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Asian&#8221; is a very convenient word for the left. It is overly broad, including people from many very different countries that have nothing in common.</p>
<p>When they want to hide the exact ethnicity, they say &#8220;asian.&#8221; When they want to band them all together for added political clout, they say &#8220;asian.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fed up with classifying people by race or ethnicity for political motives.<br>

		<p>I live less than thirty miles from where this incident took place,yet it is only through AMREN that I heard anything about it.The suppression of this news is merely the latest attempt by the metropolitan media elites to stifle the truth about the murderous assault on English and European civilisation by their imported brigands .The term&#8221;Asian&#8221;(for the benefit of Americans)<br>
applies to all people(s)from the Indian sub-continent,but as most of the trouble is caused by followers of the religion of &#8220;peace&#8221;it is now largely a synonym for Pakistani or Bengali.</p>

		<p>I well remember decades ago that in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc states, westerners used to point out the fact that all instances of popular uprisings and discontent against the regime (apparently this was quite common)were never ever reported in the official news media - which had a total monopoly of the news distribution, and hence thse events were never even suspected by the vast majority of people in those nations.<br>
  This was always held as a great failing of the former communist bloc - &#8221; if the system is so perfect, why doesn&rsquo;t it even have the self-confidence to look itself in the face&#8221;.<br>
 - Of course exactly the same criticism can evidently be levelled at multi-racialism in the UK and the government suppression of any news that seeks to undermine the monument of deceit.<br>
  It is inconceivable that a news editor would &#8216;choose&rsquo; to supress a worthy story unless instructions were received from &#8216;on high&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The silence of the Crown on these issues continues to baffle me, but only to a point.  I think that the Queen, and for that matter Prince Charles is just waiting for a groundswell that they can come out and support.  After all, Queen Elizabeth ll certainly did not shun the new BNP members of Parelment.  I think we may see some real action in England very soon.  It really seems about to bust.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight,writing at4.08PM is being over-optimistic in his hope that the Royal Family will eventually break their silence over the Dhimmification of the Dis-United Kingdom anytime soon.<br>
Since 1066 the royals have at best shown disinterest,and more often than not outright contempt towards their native&#8221;subjects&#8221;<br>
The present shower are no exception,in fact Prince Charles goes <br>
out of his way to describe himself as a Defender of &#8220;Faith&#8221; <br>
rather than &#8220;of The Faith&#8221;.Furthermore much of his working itinery is taken up by prostating himself before one or another<br>
of England&rsquo;s myriad ethnic groups.He is particularly forthcoming<br>
in his praise of Islam,leading some conspiracy theorists to speculate as to whether he might be a secret convert. <br>

		<p>  The &#8220;controlled media&#8221; is just that  &mdash;   controlled. The Fourth Estate will try to post to the back page or ignore any story that illustrates the negative consequences of multiculturalism. Political correctness and ethnic identity politics will always trump unpleasant truths.</p>
