			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Age (Melbourne), August 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The anti-immigration mayor of a northern Italian city has barred Muslim women from wearing the controversial body-concealing swimsuit known as a burqini, an Italian newsagency has reported.</p>
<p>Women wearing the garment made up of a veil, a tunic and loose leggings face a fine of 500 euros ($850) if spotted at swimming pools or riversides in the northern Piedmont town of Varallo Sesia, the ANSA news agency said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sight of a &#8216;masked woman&rsquo; could disturb small children, not to mention problems of hygiene,&#8221; mayor Gianluca Buonanno was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Aussie burqini inventor says she was not surprised that a French woman was banned from her local swimming pool for wearing a full-cover swimsuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t have to be tolerant all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justifying the move, Buonanno added: &#8220;Imagine a Western woman bathing in a bikini in a Muslim country. The consequences could be decapitation, prison or deportation. We are merely prohibiting the use of the burqini&#8221;.</p>
<p>Last week, a swimming pool in Paris refused entry to a burqini-clad Muslim on similar grounds, adding to tensions over Muslim dress in France.</p>
<p>The incident came as French MPs conducted hearings on whether to ban the burqa after President Nicolas Sarkozy said the head-to-toe body covering and veil was &#8220;not welcome&#8221; in France, home to Europe&rsquo;s biggest Muslim minority.</p>
<p>Buonanno belongs to Italy&rsquo;s Northern League, a party allied with the centre-right People of Freedom led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.</p>
<p>It has backed several initiatives hostile to Muslims.<br>

<p>I find this phrasing to be hostile to native Italians. How about &#8220;it has backed several initiatives to protect the Italian people and culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahh, much better. See what a difference positive phrasing can do for one&rsquo;s outlook?<br>

		<p>Victory in domestic warfare requires the ability to accurately identify ones enemies and then destroy them.  Muslim bearded faces and bizarre attire stands out in a crowd; hence targeting them will be child&rsquo;s play&hellip; </p>
