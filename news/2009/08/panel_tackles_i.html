			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Seccombe, MVGazette (Edgartown, Massachusetts), August 14. 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The myth that America has somehow become post-racial with the election of Barack Obama to the presidency was most succinctly nailed by the Rev. Eugene Rivers, in a fire and brimstone address at the regional high school on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one black man in the White House and a million black men in prison,&#8221; he thundered.</p>
<p>The big question, though, for Reverend Rivers, along with 30-odd other speakers  &mdash;  judges, lawyers, academics, media personalities, a couple of actors and a Congressman  &mdash;  was who bears the responsibility for that, and all the other manifestations of continuing black disadvantage in America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The consensus was that the cause of the problems of continuing black disadvantage were a mix of personal and structural, with the emphasis on the structural. But the solution would depend most heavily on individuals, particularly those members of the black community described by Reverend Rivers as &#8220;high and lifted up.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He attacked  &mdash;  there is no other word for it  &mdash;  the black elite &#8220;who celebrate themselves&#8221; while ignoring the plight of &#8220;the wretched of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>As evidence of the black elite&rsquo;s self-concern, he cited its focus on the recent arrest of Harvard Prof. Henry Louis (Skip) Gates in Cambridge.</p>
<p>Yet just five days after that, a young black girl was shot in her home when &#8220;an AK 47 was used by a 17-year-old terrorist&#8221; to spray a city building with bullets. One of them passed through three walls before hitting the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was not one word said. There were no invitations to the White House,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All across this country, the black underclass is suffering. There&rsquo;s been no discourse or conversation about our moral responsibility to those whom we left behind. Shame on us, after we&rsquo;ve achieved everything we&rsquo;ve achieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great moral challenge for black America is not about a black in the White House, but we reconcile with the fact that there are now two separate black nations: those who live and die in the ghetto and those of us who celebrate our beauty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He warned that within a decade those ghettos could produce unimaginable problems. He suggested home-grown terrorism. Saudi Arabian money was financing Wahabist Islam chaplaincies in inner cities and jails, to politicize alienated young black men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reggie Walton, a judge of the U.S. District Court, said Reverend Rivers had his numbers wrong: in reality there were probably two million black men locked up on any given day in one penal institution or another.</p>
<p>As evidence of the structural unfairness of the justice system, he noted the disparity between the sentences imposed for possession of crack cocaine  &mdash;  mostly used by people of color  &mdash;  and powder cocaine  &mdash;  mostly used by whites.</p>
<p>He admitted to being a tough-sentencing judge, but said he also was troubled by such unfairnesses in the system.</p>
<p>Another federal judge, Nancy Gertner, noted such unfairness was inseparable from politics.</p>
<p>What she called &#8220;the greatest incarceration of African-Americans since reconstruction&#8221; had served to &#8220;de-racialize the race debate&#8221; by redefining imprisonment  &mdash;  which results in most cases with a denial of voting rights  &mdash;  not as an issue of civil rights anymore, but simply as a matter of &#8220;these people are bad,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>And Democratic Cong. Barney Frank pushed the political aspect one step further, arguing political conservatives used race as a weapon in their efforts to maintain inequities which affect not only black Americans, but all Americans.</p>

		<p>Trouble is brewing.  Knowing the capabilities of Blacks for violence, this is going to spill into the street, and I&rsquo;m afraid we (White people) are by and large going to be the victims of it.</p>
<p>Obama has been President for 7 months already and every Black person is not King of the World yet.  This will never do.  Time for Blacks to go out and get the White man because as we all know it&rsquo;s ALWAYS the White Man&rsquo;s fault.</p>

		<p>The cocaine issue is a major laugh because it illustrates just how short the time period is for Black Americans.  In the 80s crack was destroying Black communities at an alarming and even amazing rate.  Powder was not having the same effect on White communities (even though to even admit there is a white community is considered to be racism).<br>
 <br>
It was the Black &#8220;Leaders&#8221; who demanded action in the form of laws they hoped would put the evil crack dealers away for a LONG time.  It has been around 20 years now.  The people who demanded the crack dealers receive special laws have forgotten all about it.  People interpreting those events through today&rsquo;s lens are getting a skewed perspective.<br>
 <br>
The cocaine disparity was caused by Black leaders BEGGING for it, not institutional racism.  The issue fits neatly on the surface, so they run with the distorted view instead of the facts.  Why?  </p>

(B)   0%</p>
<p>Whenever I read these remarks, I&rsquo;m reminded of the satire of Monty Python when a criminal is caught and he says, &#8220;It&rsquo;s a fair cop but society is to blame&#8221;. To which the policeman replies, &#8220;Agreed. We&rsquo;ll be charging them too&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This minister complains on the one hand about so many black men in prison, and then on the other hand about how nobody paid attention to a black girl being shot in the back because of a &#8220;17-year old terrorist.&#8221;  By &#8220;terrorist,&#8221; they mean friendly local thug.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t have it both ways.  </p>
<p>Also, the disparate sentences for crack compared to powder cocaine were asked for and received by black civil rights preachers way back in the 1980s, because of the impact crack was having on black communities.  As if the crack has the power all by itself to impact people.</p>

<p>The Blacks who succeed in America are the ones that speak proper English, go to school, don&rsquo;t get pregnant at 14, don&rsquo;t rob or hurt innocent people, and otherwise act like a civilized HUMAN BEING. </p>
<p>When are Blacks going to take responsibility for their OWN lives and their OWN communities? Quit blaming Whitey and take care of your own &#8216;structural problems&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>On the subject of race, the headlines today was about yet another of the innumerable cases of black US soldiers stationed overseas raping and murdering the local women: This is the case of a black by the name of Robert Brown or Baltimore who, as a 43 year old, raped and murdered a German teenager by the name of Nicola Stiel in 1984 in Germany. (And while there he also fathered illegitimate child with another German woman that, in typical fashion, he abandoned.) He is just now being extradited to Germany from a US prison (where he is serving time for some other crime). DNA technology not available in 1984 is now able to prove the semen found on the victim was his. He was a suspect at the time and fled Germany.<br>
What a wake of destruction left by this black brought by the US into the midst of an otherwise almost crime-free oversees society. </p>

<p>&#8220;Despite a clear propensity towards crime demonstrated by the presence of a million black men in prison, America, a majority White nation was fair enough to elect a black man to the highest office in the country&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Aside from being virtually the same tired nonsense to a word that we&rsquo;ve all heard a million times before, I cannot believe they continue to trot out the old crack vs. powder cocaine cannard! Crackheads receive different prison sentences because, unlike the foolish white powder user, they almost invariably have a record as long as the Hudson River and a violent and terrifying one at that. American Blacks have become as delusional as they are predictable.</p>

		<p>There they go again. This Judge Walton who is black and Judge Gertner who might be, making excuses why there are so many useless wretched black bum&rsquo;s in jail. This is so typical of the so called Black Elite. While saying that he is a tough sentencer he ties himself in knots railing about the unfairness of the system. Just one more example of the Black Elite circling the wagons to defend the bruthas.</p>

		<p>Interesting how a million black men in prison is characterized as a &#8220;tragedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that black men commit crimes at eight times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined, one would think that having a million of them behind bars, as opposed to running around loose, would be considered a social benefit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not as though their criminal conduct in this country represents some inexplicable abberation in black African behavior.  In fact it is the immutable behavioral pattern of black Africans throughout the entire world, wherever they&rsquo;re found in significant numbers.  There are no exceptions to their anti-social criminality and destructiveness.</p>
<p>The real tragedy is not that so many of them are incarcerated but rather that we are afflicted with so many of them in the first place.</p>
<p>As Abraham Lincoln once observed, &#8220;They are the rock upon which this country is breaking apart.&#8221;  If only John Wilkes Booth had known of Lincoln&rsquo;s firm intent to remove them from our country perhaps America would be a very different place today.</p>

<p>Exactly.  Please, let&rsquo;s stop treating the good and the bad as the same kind of people.  Enough of bashing blacks as a group, while forgetting the good ones.  Let&rsquo;s remember that blacks (or Hispanics or Asian or whoever) in general are not our real problem.  Our real problem is our traitorious politicians of every color, mostly WHITE.</p>
<p>However, if we have to or could separate along racial lines, the absence of black (and Hispanic) criminals and welfare queens would be worth the absence of the rest, however unfair that might be.</p>
