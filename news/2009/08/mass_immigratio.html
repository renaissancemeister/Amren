<h1><a href="https://www.newswithviews.com/Wooldridge/frosty489.htm">Mass Immigration Destroying Black American Communities</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frosty Wooldridge, News With Views, August 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Detroit, Michigan, a city where I worked for 15 years, presents a mirror of Black communities around America. African-Americans in 1990 made up 67 percent of the total population. In the past 15 years, 300,000 Muslim immigrants moved into the Detroit area with tens of thousands being illegal. In the process, they pushed African-Americans out of their communities.</p>
<p>At the same time, immigrants took jobs from American Blacks at alarming rates of speed. Immigrants undercut Blacks in auto work, janitorial, fast food, construction, taxi cab service, grounds keeping and just about every job in Detroit formerly worked by American Blacks.</p>
<p>Last year, NBC anchor Brian Williams reported a 76 percent dropout rate for Detroit high schools. At first, that number seems impossible, but educational disintegration began with adding a dozen languages to Detroit&rsquo;s classrooms, i.e., Arabic, Spanish, and many more dialects alien to America. With the linguistic chaos came ethnic tension. Without a single language and small classroom size, American Blacks in Detroit and across the nation suffered increasing academic failure.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, unlawful immigrants&rsquo; kids commandeered classrooms into learning centers for Spanish speaking only at the gross neglect of American Blacks. Numerous &#8216;race riots&rsquo; resulted, but the main stream media neglected to cover them or named them &#8216;incidents&rsquo;. Today, LA high schools see cops on every corridor of high schools and most Americans that can afford it, send their kids to private schools.</p>
<p>Listen to my friend TerryAnderson on Sundays. He chronicles the events as they happen to Black Americans in LA. He roars, &#8220;If you ain&rsquo;t mad, you ain&rsquo;t payin&rsquo; attention!&#8221; He exposes how Mexicans kill Blacks, take over the schools, take the jobs, trash the neighborhoods and run Blacks out of LA. Pretty scary stuff but happening today!</p>
<p>What happens when kids do not receive an education at the most basic high school level? How do they function at a functionally illiterate level?</p>
<p>Black women have the highest teen pregnancy rate (134 per 1,000 women aged 15-19) in America. I think latest statistics show unwed Black mothers outnumber married Black mothers.</p>
<p>They immediately become welfare queens with 1,2,3,4, 5 and more babies. In Detroit, I watched them step through the Kroger doors with five kids lined up hand in hand with one on the way. After I had worked a 14 hour day, they used my money via food stamps to feed their broods. Didn&rsquo;t make me happy!</p>
<p>As for Black Americans:</p>
<p>Dwight Kirk of Coalition of Black Trade Unionists said, &#8220;The black unemployment rate jumped or leaped or bounced  &mdash;  whatever verb fits  &mdash;  from 10.8 percent in May to 11.8 percent in June  &mdash;  more than 3 times the increase in the national rate. Bottom line: as the jobless crisis has gotten worse for all workers, the heaviest toll has been on black workers, millions who are becoming nomads in a globalized job market. The June unemployment report contained even more eye-opening &#8220;news&#8221;:</p>
<p>Nearly half of the 360,000 people who lost their jobs in June were African Americans, even though black workers are only 11 percent of the civilian workforce.</p>
<p>Black workers suffered the highest job loss (172,000) of all races or ethnic groups in June.</p>
<p>While white unemployment inched up from 5.4 percent in May to 5.5 percent in June, black unemployment, already in double digits, soared from 10.8 percent to 11.8 percent in the same month (i.e., 10 times the increase in the white unemployment rate).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 40 percent of black teenagers were unemployed in June, nearly 2 times the rate for white teens.</p>
<p>The long-term trends are even more daunting. In the year since June 2002:</p>
<p>The number of unemployed black workers has increased by nearly a quarter of a million (214,000).</p>
<p>The black unemployment rate has increased four times faster than the rate for white workers (1.2 percent versus .3 percent, respectively).</p>
<p>Black teenage unemployment has risen from 30 percent to 40 percent in just one year (in what economists call a jobless economic recovery).</p>
<p>Dirk said, &#8220;This statistical snapshot is a timely wake-up call about several important trends:</p>
<p>(1) The current unemployment crisis is having a profoundly unequal impact on different segments of the workforce.</p>
<p>(2) The job crisis is accelerating in the African American community.</p>
<p>(3) Because of the sharp and substantial increase in black unemployment, the jobless disparity between black and white workers is growing significantly.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, our U.S. Congress pumps an added 138,000 new immigrants into this country every month. Again, it allows another 100,000 to enter the job market unlawfully as illegal aliens each month. Those immigrants cost, according to the Edwin Rubenstein report: $346 billion annually across 15 federal agencies every year.</p>
<p>Imagine what that money could do for Black America!</p>
<p>I find it peculiar that our new Black President Obama rolls along like our former White presidents with his ignoring our borders, our jobs and our communities being overrun by illegal alien migrants. While Black America suffers in the unemployment lines, White America finds itself in similar circumstances. In excess of 15 million Americans cannot find a job and 32.2 million Americans subsist on food stamps! That&rsquo;s horrifically crazy to be happening in America!</p>
<p>At what point will Obama and Congress turn off the flood spigot? At what point will they enforce our laws and represent Black and White American citizens rather than wholesale corruption being carried on by every employer of illegal aliens  &mdash;  all 20 million of them and more?!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on right now is downright sickening to all Americans!<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m supposed to cry over this?  Hispanics displacing blacks is only a matter of what goes around comes around   &mdash;   the blacks displaced whites in these very same neighborhoods only decades ago.</p>
<p>As big of victims they are of displacement at the hands of cheap Hispanic labor are blacks, their elected leaders don&rsquo;t seem to notice.  In fact, they only encourage more of the same.</p>

		<p><i>In the process, they [Muslims] pushed African-Americans out of their communities.</i></p>
<p>Any thought about the blacks who &#8220;pushed&#8221; out Detroit whites?  Detroit was not always a &#8220;black&#8221; city.</p>
<p><i>At the same time, immigrants took jobs from American Blacks at alarming rates of speed.</i></p>
<p>I doubt that anyone &#8220;took&#8221; the black man&rsquo;s job.  At the same time, there is no doubt that a lack of employability is an indigenous black trait.</p>
<p><i>Last year, NBC anchor Brian Williams reported a 76 percent dropout rate for Detroit high schools. At first, that number seems impossible, but educational disintegration began with adding a dozen languages to Detroit&rsquo;s classrooms&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Educational disintegration was certainly sped up by this sort of multi-cultural language instruction, however it is doubtful that this fact, alone, is responsible for <i>black</i> academic problems.  Academic problems are an indigenous black trait.</p>
<p><i>In Los Angeles, unlawful immigrants&rsquo; kids commandeered classrooms into learning centers for Spanish speaking only at the gross neglect of American Blacks. Numerous &lsquo;race riots&rsquo; resulted&hellip;</i></p>
<p>This is an interesting analysis.  For the first time I can recall, indigenous whites are not being blamed for black problems.  However, black violence cannot rightly be attributed to immigrant kids, no matter how degenerate they are, since violence is an intrinsic black trait.</p>
<p><i>&hellip;Mexicans kill Blacks, take over the schools, take the jobs, trash the neighborhoods and run Blacks out&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Swap black for Mexican and white for black and the sentence remains true  &mdash;  with the exception of taking the jobs as many blacks are simply not employable (unless we are talking about black affirmative action for the top 20% or so; then the sentence is actually completely true using the word substitutions).</p>
<p><i>Black women have the highest teen pregnancy rate (134 per 1,000 women aged 15-19) in America. I think latest statistics show unwed Black mothers outnumber married Black mothers.</i></p>
<p>This fact may be true, to blame Muslims is a non-sequitur.  </p>
<p><i>&hellip;immigrants cost&hellip;346 billion annually across 15 federal agencies every year.  Imagine what that money could do for Black America!</i></p>
<p>Imagine what the mostly white taxpayers could do with their money back, instead.</p>
<p><i>I find it peculiar that our new Black President Obama rolls along like our former White presidents with his ignoring our borders&hellip;</i></p>
<p>This is a question all blacks should be asking themselves.  The reason: most whites have been beaten down and are obsequious to blacks.  Whites are the best thing blacks have ever found.  However, in most respects, Mexican &#8220;immigrants&#8221; and Muslims are very like blacks.  That is, hostile to civilization, and in their group behaviors.  These 3rd World immigrants will not turn aside and allow blacks to either mistreat or take advantage of them.  I think blacks will rue the day of open borders.  </p>

		<p> I find it interesting that despite Obama&rsquo;s non effort to enforce our immigration laws, and blacks KNOW their jobs are being taken by illegals, they continue to support him. It just goes to show they care more for the color of his skin than his policies. OR, it could be they just don&rsquo;t care about jobs and are hoping Obama will provide them with more welfare and free healthcare. I tend to lean toward the latter.</p>

		<p>Thinking strategically, race realists need to find a way to get some minority groups (besides Asians and Jews) on our side.  We need to decide if our &#8220;conservatism&#8221; ought to extend to the pro-business importation of cheap labor; or if we&rsquo;d rather align with many blacks&rsquo; support for cultural conservatism.  </p>
<p>If we can&rsquo;t split women&rsquo;s, blacks&rsquo;, Hispanics&rsquo; and Asian religions&rsquo; interests into separate and mutually exclusive issues, they&rsquo;ll maintain a &#8220;diversity coalition&#8221; of everyone else against white males.<br>

		<p>&#8220;With the linguistic chaos came ethnic tension. Without a single language and small classroom size, American Blacks in Detroit and across the nation suffered increasing academic failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The writer makes a good point in making the latest attempt to justify &#8220;Black&#8221; scholastic failure. The persistency of the American &#8220;Black&#8221; playing the cool-fool by his use of Ebonic based speech -  along with other behavioral problems - does result in lots of &#8220;ethnic&#8221; tension whenever he is schooled among English speaking White, Latino, and Asian students.</p>
<p>The fact is, though, the typical American &#8220;Black&#8221; just does not hustle. This is so both during his school years, and afterward. This is because of the inflated ego of the American &#8220;Black&#8221;. He has been taught to believe such behavior to be beneath his dignity, and therefore, he has the right to be &#8220;kicked upstairs&#8221;. </p>
<p>As the world becomes more and more competitive, this cannot work in the long run.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks pushed aside by Muslim and Hispanic immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The main reason they&rsquo;re pushed aside is because blacks can&rsquo;t compete with either group, Muslims or Hispanics.  It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>The MSM radicals love to constantly compare blacks to whites, citing something to do with the achievement gap as if this is some mysterious unknown that stupifies research academics who are confounded by the disparity.</p>
<p>But it appears as if they aren&rsquo;t really confounded at all, because if they were they would also cite the disparity of blacks and every other group in the US, because blacks are behind everybody.</p>
<p>That FACT has NEVER EVER been reported by the leftist MSM goons, nor the academics themselves who do the research.</p>
<p>And we all know that &#8220;research&#8221; when in concerns blacks is a code word for &#8220;coverup.&#8221; </p>

		<p>&#8220;Thinking strategically, race realists need to find a way to get some minority groups (besides Asians and Jews) on our side. We need to decide if our &ldquo;conservatism&rdquo; ought to extend to the pro-business importation of cheap labor; or if we&rsquo;d rather align with many blacks&rsquo; support for cultural conservatism. &#8220;</p>
<p>Since when are Jews on our side?  Virtually every school busing, enhanced rights for black criminals, affirmative action, and anti White lawsuit is filed by attorneys with Jewish names.</p>
<p>I well remember reading the list of more than 90 attorneys who filed the lawsuit against the California anti affirmative action proposition, Prop 209.  More than 70 of the 90 attorneys had Jewish names.</p>
<p>Asians have the best of both the merit system and affirmative action.  As intelligent, skilled hardworking people (some of them) they succeed by merit.  As non Whites they are as much affirmative action aristocrats as blacks and hispanics.  </p>
<p>The combination of high test scores and affirmative action has served to replace Whites with Asians in many of our most prestigious universities, including the entire California system.</p>
<p>As for cultural conservatism, who cares?  We are not going to win back equal rights for Whites by joining with the anti abortion anti gay minorities.  The anti abortion anti gay groups have faithfully voted Republican for 40 years and the REpublicans have not helped them at all.</p>
<p>We are on our own, and anyone who thinks Asians and Jews are not as anti White as the blacks and Obama is totally wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>
<p>I am sure there must be a few Jews out there who realize that they are White and therefore under the gun of affirmative action and black on White crime, but 90 percent of Jews, and every Jewish organization is firmly in the anti White, pro school busing, pro affirmative action, pro destruction of White neighborhoods in the name of fair housing for blacks, and pro anti White immigrants camp.</p>
<p>The cultural conservatives ought to look at the facts behind the black and hispanic so called conservative family values.  Blacks and hispanics have the highest rates of both abortion and illegitimate children and are responsible for approxiamately 85 percent of the rapes in this country.</p>
<p>Some conservative family values.</p>

<p>Eternal question that&rsquo;s never answered: where in America is a region that&rsquo;s changed from White to black and educational achievement has gone up, crime down, and also illegitimacies down?</p>
<p>In my experience, NEVER!</p>

The point is that the modern Democratic Party is simply an anti-White male alliance (not that the Republicans are pro-White male).<br>
 The alliance serves its purpose an marginilized White men.But blacks must awake to realise that the alliance they formed is, in fact, worse for them than the old-time White male ascendancy.<br>
     All it&rsquo;s done is to give women, Mexicans and other assorted non-White immigrants to push themselves in front of the &#8216;victimhood&rsquo; stakes and to scoop up all the goodies. <br>

		<p>The only behavior destroying black &#8220;communities&#8221; is the behavior of the blacks living there. The unemployment rate disparity has to do with the inability of blacks to as effectively compete for jobs as other groups. A system based upon competition will always have winners and losers. The stats in this article are just more glaring evidence of the racial equality myth.</p>

		<p>Illegal immigration is Economic Genocide of African-Americans.  </p>
<p>This is because illegals will work for lower salaries than African-Americans.  To a certain extent, each illegal immigrant that enters the USA displaces one African-American from a job.  The overabundance of cheap labor forces wages lower, making it impossible for inner-city kids to survive at those low wages.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration destroys the Black community by forcing low-skilled Blacks to choose between slave-wages or unemployment.  Without millions of desperate illegals flooding our nation, salaries would rise and low skilled Blacks could find good employment.</p>

		<p>Blacks thought they had it bad when Whitey was the majority!  Well, just wait until all of the judges, cops, politicians, and government workers are illegals and anchor babies!  Right now, many blacks are siding with the illegals because &#8220;anything that hurts whites is good.&#8221;  They love seeing whites become a minority.  They figure the Hispanics will join with them (the blacks) against whitey.  Well, guess again.  Latinos hate blacks and cannot be made to feel guilty the way whites do.  Latinos couldn&rsquo;t care less about slavery or Jim Crow or segregation.  Most of them weren&rsquo;t even in this country when those things were going on.  </p>
<p>I admit to feeling a certain sympathy for the blacks, because at least they were born here, are citizens, and speak English, (sort of.)  They didn&rsquo;t sneak across the border like thieves in the night.  And the blacks who kicked whites out of their neighborhoods are mostly really old now, or dead.  It&rsquo;s younger blacks who are suffering from the Mexican invasion these days.  But they&rsquo;d better wake up and start joining whites in the fight to 1. get illegals deported, 2. stop the anchor baby provision, 3. get employers of illegals fined and jailed, 4. a moratorium on even legal immigration, 5. shut the borders tight.  If we don&rsquo;t do all of the above, we are all doomed, black and white alike.</p>

These are the blacks we are supposed to count as allies? No thanks, Frosty. If I have to choose then I&rsquo;ll take my chances with the newcomers.

<p>That is a hard and somewhat important question.</p>
<p>Whites actually have much in common with blacks. Their communities were more livable before civil rights, affirmative action, and the welfare state. BOTH white communities and theirs are the worse for them.</p>
<p>One of the purposes of integration and civil rights was to suborn the talented black tenth and wed them to the system, rather than see them lead a black separatist revolution. Poorer blacks were deprived of the direct care and direct discipline of elite blacks   &mdash;  - the people with the most natural interest in caring about them   &mdash;   and were instead given the care and discipline of the state, which tends to destroy whatever it touches.</p>
<p>Malcolm X was a guy we could have done business with.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no more dysgenic policy for blacks than welfare, and I think enough time has passed now for it to have made a difference. We are in similar boats, but they are perhaps less useful to whites today than they might have been in the past.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think whites actually NEED anybody else. First things first, get our own house in order   &mdash;   and that starts with our literal households. Allies will appear.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true, some whites do continue to support Obama despite the immigration issue, but no where near as high as blacks do.<br>

		<p>I agree with the posters about getting more minorities to join the immigration reduction cause. It&rsquo;s not just about numbers (though that helps). It&rsquo;s about shedding the image that anyone opposed to high immigration levels is racist. Which I don&rsquo;t believe. To me its more about obtaining sustainable population levels for our future (especially my children&rsquo;s). We can&rsquo;t reverse what has happened but we can stop more of this madness. Once we can at least reduce the stigma of the racism associaton with immigration reduction advocates, other like minded folks will join.</p>
<p>The author, Frosty Woolridge, is a very ardent supporter of immigration reductions. He is no fan of Affirmative Action. And he is certainly not a liberal, for those posters who intimated he is a liberal standing up for blacks. He sees the need to draw minorities into the movement who want to have a sustainable future in the US. Think about this. If 90% of blacks supported reductions today, we would not have illegal immigration right now. And most assuredly, the legal immigration levels would be much lower. The politicans fear of being called racist has stymied attempts to reduce levels. Let&rsquo;s give them cover to do the right thing. So why not use that fear to our advantage by getting more minorities to see the negative impact immigrants have on them and their children&rsquo;s future? Immigration is the gravest threat to our country today. For every US citizen.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Though I feel like many of you that blacks have only themselves to blame, ultimately, for the immigration disaster that is now unfolding in our communities, I&rsquo;d like to remind whites here to think about what will happen after the Hispanics are finished wiping blacks out. Here&rsquo;s a hint: they won&rsquo;t leave America peacefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are under 40, just change your last name to an hispanic one.  If you have children change their names before they enter high school.  With an average white IQ and a Spanish last name, the most mediocore white will get full scholarships to the best colleges and offered the best paid, easiest make work jobs going.</p>
<p>Look at Sotomayer.  She is smart for a Puerto Rican, probably an IQ of 110.  Look what happened to her. Had she been white she would have attended a 4th level law school and now be practicing hardscrabble law out of some shared office space in a shabby mini mall; no assistants, just voice mail, probably doing her own typing. </p>
<p>Sotomayer&rsquo;s last name took her to Harvard, the best law firms and Judgeship to Judgeship. </p>
<p>Reminds me of medieval times when the King&rsquo;s nieces and nephews were appointed Abbesses of the wealthiest convents and Bishops at age 20. But we are now a society committed to &#8220;equality&#8221; and &#8220;equal rights&#8221; no favoritism in America (gag gag gag gag)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget my friend Janet Mendez, nee Beherend, a German name.  She has blue eyes, very fair skin and light brown hair.  She married a man with a Spanish last name.  </p>
<p>She kept failing civil service exams (back when they still existed) then she became Mrs. Mendez and suddenly she passed with a high score.  She got a civil service job.  Then she seemed to get a promotion about every 2 years until she was an assistant Chief Probation Officer. Then she was recruited by another County and became Chief Probation Officer.  She had 20 years in at the first County, so she will get social security and pensions from 2 counties when she retires.</p>
<p>The joke is, her Mr. Mendez husband is of German heritage.  He was actually born in East Germany when it was under Russian occupation.  His parents escaped when he was a baby and settled in Nicarauga, changed their name and learned Spanish.  They came to the United States when he was about 12. They kept the name Mendez.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what a Spanish last name can do for a career.  Face reality.  Our own elites want us dead and gone.</p>
<p>Then there was my friend Carl with a Spanish last name.  Beginning fall of his junior in college he began getting letters from every civil service job in the country begging him to come to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sauve qui peut&#8221;  save yourself if you can is the literal translation.  The implication is that your army is totally defeated, disorganized, the officers have lost control and or are dead and it&rsquo;s every man for himself.  There is no coherent army left to help you.</p>
<p>Whites are weaklings who have surrendered to the liberals and minorities without a bit of protest.  Join the group that can help you.<br>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Stacy Burdett of the Anti Defamation League&hellip; said that her organization would stand with Latinos on the immigration issue. &hellip;She said that the ADL would continue its fight for &#8216;comprehensive immigration reform&rsquo; and that &#8216;this issue is at the top of our domestic agenda.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The ADL&rsquo;s Burdett said it had been working on trying to get newspapers to stop allowing anonymous posting as a way to change the tone of online discussion on immigration&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/lmfwx3</p>
<p>To silence any opposition, of course.  The ADL and SPLC are masters of this tactic but any criticism of them is immediately branded as hate speech and/or anti-semitism.</p>

		<p>Before the end of his term, Mexican President Vicente Fox made a comment about how &#8220;Mexican immigrants do jobs that even the blacks wont do.&#8221; Of course Al Sharpton and the usual suspects started whining and complaining but he&rsquo;s right. Of course for the right pay, whites could do the jobs now taken by immigrants, but that just wouldn&rsquo;t be profitable enough for our corporate class. This is in contrast to Blacks, for whom no amount of pay would ever make them into productive workers.</p>

<p>Your comments amount not only to treason but to a betrayal. Men like Will Travis and Crockett gave their lives at the Alamo and fought to death and to the last man. Like the scenario you describe today, they had no reinforcements on the way. They knew they would die anyway yet they fought to the last man against the invading Mexican forces. They did this to serve as a warning to the Hispanic forces that they would face such opposition in the forthcoming war. They fought to the last. Yet here you are already capitulating even while you have larger numbers against a weaker enemy. You are already talking of CHANGING THE NAME OF YOUR FOREFATHERS AND YOUR ANCESTRY just to get cheap benefits THAT ARE YOURS BY RIGHT ANYWAY!. Is this the spirit in which the likes of 26 year old Will Travis fought to the last at the Alamo?. Is your talk and attitude not tantamount to treason and a mockery of the sacrifice of him and others like him?<br>
Those men who fought and died at that battle and many other subequent ones to give the likes of you so many freedoms must be turning in their graves right now and asking themselves &#8216;is this what we died for? These spineless wimps who would sell their heritage and even their progeny for a bowl of porridge?&rsquo;</p>

<p>To QD:</p>
<p>I would never say or write that.  It is akin to saying that ALL Americans represent the American government.  The government and the people are not the same thing.<br>
That is why I refer to those who are trying to turn the US into an all-powerful, suppressive/oppressive  government-controlled state via outlawing Free Speech, The Second Amendment, suspension of Free Markets and other institutions that have marked Western Civilization and made White Civilizations the richest, most prosperous on earth,The Hostile Elite (a term Kevin McDonald uses). </p>
<p>Hostile elites include anyone or anything that undermines limited government and works for the destruction of Whites and White homelands via unlimited non-White immigration, especially from the Third World.   The people who are doing this to our freedom and our homeland deserve to be &#8216;outed&rsquo; and all scorn and contempt heaped upon them and their institutions.  They also must be stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p>We are becoming a minority and losing the country whose Founding Fathers declared it set aside for &#8216;ourselves and our posterity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ADL AND the SPLC certainly have a lot of power and money to threaten those with whom they do not agree  &mdash;  all with the government&rsquo;s blessing.  These organizations work mightily to keep Whites disorganized and atomized and thus unable to form protective groups and fund advocates that work in their interests. They whole-heartedly support the marginalization of Whites, it not their outright destruction.</p>
<p>At least Jews, and every other non-White, have the government-granted privilege of banding together and calling up one of their etho-centric organizations in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>I only ask that Whites be allowed the same privilege without having to risk their careers, pensions and reputations and/or being called Nazis, Klansmen and White Supremacists for doing the exact same thing every other racial and/or ethnic group is allowed.   </p>
<p>But there are a few signs of hope:</p>
<p>Notice the reactions to those angered, ordinary White Americans who DARED to challenged THEIR elected representatives over the past few days during the town hall meetings?  And for doing this they were roughed up, shoved, called Nazis, told they were &#8216;put up by insurance companies.&rsquo;  Even the way they dressed was harshly criticized.  The government was so shocked that the sheeple are finally fighting back that obama (according to Rush) told the dems to &#8216;hit back twice as hard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maybe the Kulaks are finally getting tired of having their freedom taken away?</p>
<p>This is what we are up against.</p>

<p>One of those union thug ambushes was not too far from where I used to live, at the Russ Carnahan town hall in St. Louis.  The only thing I can say about that is when most people think about labor unions and organized labor, they think of middle aged white men working in heavy industry and manufacturing.  The hard truth of the matter is that that kind of work and those kind of unions have been on the decline for decades.  The milieu of union thugs that took out after conservative protesters at the St. Louis town hall event weren&rsquo;t those kind of unions.  They were members or organizers of/with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU)  &mdash;  We know this because they were wearing SEIU blue shirts.  The SEIU mainly represents organized health care, nursing home, janitorial and government workers, the latter sometimes crossing paths with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).  And when you&rsquo;re talking about the kind of industries the SEIU is known for, you&rsquo;re talking mainly black and Hispanic workers.  And any union that represents government workers, regardless of race, has a built-in incentive to lobby for big government.</p>
<p>The SEIU is pro-amnesty.</p>

		<p>I hate to sound uncaring, but I really don&rsquo;t have much sympathy for seeing blacks get displaced by whites.  Blacks have pushed whites out of their neighborhoods, out of jobs, and out of positions of power, while openly making racist comments about whites and even attacking us (physically as well as legally) for the past 50 years.  not to mention that, they only wanted the muslims and hispanics to &#8216;unite with them&rsquo; to gain up against white people.

<p>Yes, and Asians know this and want their share of the racial spoils system.  Why should they sit by while blacks and hispanics get all of the government&rsquo;s largess? Seems they are jumping on the &#8216;poor victim&rsquo; bandwagon as well.</p>

<p>80-20 wants quotas for federal judges and top management in government and private industry. And it is playing hardball to get them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>From QD:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The SEIU mainly represents organized health care&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>They also represent most if not all of the non-teaching jobs in the Los Angeles unified school district. When Roy Romer took over as superintendent, he wanted to privatize those jobs because the union members had negotiated fat salaries and benefits far beyond what their counterparts earned in the private sector  &mdash;  to the detriment of the district&rsquo;s budget.</p>
<p>All hell broke loose and the issue was quickly stomped down.  The school district, as I&rsquo;ve explained before,  is first and foremost an employment agency for non-Whites.</p>
<p>The entire legislature is controlled by the unions here in California.</p>
<p>As for the union thugs at the Town Hall meetings, Bobby Eberle reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.The Service Employees International Union says it&rsquo;s working to turn out its members at town-halls in states where it has a presence, coordinating with members of Congress to orchestrate turnout. The group advises them to coordinate event-day strategy in advance with congressional aides&hellip; to assign individuals to shadow reporters and &#8216;be assertive&rsquo;&hellip;. It provides suggested questions and possible chants to use in drowning out raucous opponents&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember obama&rsquo;s words:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Barack Obama told a crowd of supporters in Philadelphia back in 2008, &#8216;If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.&rsquo; He added, &#8216;That&rsquo;s the Chicago way.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>A few facts about George Soros and SEIU.</p>
<p>If you believe the White House, there are 30 million Americans who support a government health care takeover. But if you look at the funding behind the Obamacare campaign, it&rsquo;s the same few leftist billionaires, union bosses and partisan community organizers pushing the socialized medicine agenda. Let&rsquo;s connect the dots.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a national &#8220;grassroots&#8221; coalition called Health Care for America Now (HCAN) will march on Capitol Hill to demand universal health care. </p>
<p>The ground troops won&rsquo;t have to march very far. HCAN, you see, is no heartland network. It is headquartered at 1825 K Street in Washington, D.C. &mdash; smack dab in the middle of Beltway lobby land. </p>
<p>In fact, 1825 K Street is Ground Zero for a plethora of &#8220;progressive&#8221; groups subsidized by anti-war, anti-Republican, Big Nanny special interests. Around Washington, the office complex is known as &#8220;The Other K Street.&#8221; The Washington Post noted in 2007 that </p>
<p>&#8220;its most prominent tenants form an abbreviated who&rsquo;s who of well-funded allies of the Democratic Party. &hellip; Big money from unions such as the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, as well as the Internet-fueled MoveOn, has provided groups like those at 1825 K Street the wherewithal to mount huge campaigns.&#8221;</p>
<p>MoveOn, of course, is the recreational political vehicle of radical liberal sugar daddy George Soros. The magnate&rsquo;s financial fingerprints are all over the HCAN coalition, which includes MoveOn, the action fund of the Center for American Progress (a Soros think tank) and the Campaign for America&rsquo;s Future (a pro-welfare state lobbying outfit).</p>
<p>HCAN has a $40 million budget, with $10 million pitched in by The Atlantic Philanthropies &mdash; a Bermuda-based organization fronted by Soros acolyte Gara LaMarche. Also in the money mix: notorious Democratic donors Herb and Marion Sandler, the left-wing moguls who made billions selling subprime mortgages and helped Soros fund his vast network of left-wing activist satellites. By their side is billionaire Peter Lewis of Progressive Insurance, whose &#8220;Progressive Future&#8221; youth group has dispatched clueless volunteers armed with clipboards and literature bashing Rush Limbaugh and Fox News to scare up support for Obamacare.</p>
<p>And two more left-wing heavyweights joining the HCAN parade: the corruption-plagued SEIU (which has battled numerous embezzlement scandals among its chapters across the country while crusading for consumer and patients&rsquo; rights) and Obama&rsquo;s old chums at fraud-riddled ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. </p>
<p>ACORN and HCAN are linked by left-wing philanthropist Drummond Pike, who heads the nonprofit Tides Foundation/Tides Center. As the tax disclaimer for HCAN discloses, &#8220;HCAN is related to Health Care for America Education Fund, a project of The Tides Center, a section 501(c)(3) public charity.&#8221; For decades, the Tides Center and its parent organization, the Tides Foundation, have seeded some of the country&rsquo;s most radical activist groups of the left, including the communist-friendly United for Peace and Justice, the jihadist-friendly National Lawyers Guild and the grievance-mongering Council on American-Islamic Relations.</p>
<p>Pike is the same philanthropist who assisted ACORN founder Wade Rathke after his brother, Dale, was caught embezzling nearly $1 million from the group. Wade Rathke sits on the Tides Foundation board of directors. In a conspiracy to cover up Dale Rathke&rsquo;s massive theft of funds, Pike volunteered to buy a promissory note worth $800,000 to cover the debt. These are the populist do-gooders supposedly looking out for you and your health.</p>
<p>Why do they want Obamacare? An internal ACORN memo I obtained from August 2008 makes the motives clear: &#8220;Over our 38 years, health care organizing has never been a major focus either nationally or locally for ACORN,&#8221; wrote ACORN Philadelphia regional director Craig Robbins. &#8220;But increasingly, ACORN offices around the country are doing work on health care.&#8221; The goal: &#8220;Building ACORN Power.&#8221;</p>
<p> The memo outlines the ACORN/HCAN partnership and their strategy of opposing any programs that rely on &#8220;unregulated private insurance&#8221; &mdash; and then parlaying political victory on government-run health care &#8220;to move our ACORN agenda (or at least part of it) with key electeds that we might otherwise not be able to pull off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The objective, in other words, is to piggyback and exploit Obamacare to improve and protect their political health. </p>
<p>The &#8220;grassroots&#8221; movement is not about representing Main Street. It&rsquo;s about peddling influence and power at 1825 K Street.<br>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t speak on Detroit but Los Angeles used to be a nice safe family oriented place where kids played baseball in the street and a good number of people didn&rsquo;t bother to lock their doors at night. Today it is a dangerous place. Same with Chicago. </p>

		<p>In the case of black discontent at the Hispanic invasion and its ill-effects on their race, it&rsquo;s true to say that <i>what goes around comes around.</i> They might as well get accustomed to being walked on and kicked down into the gutter by our Hispanic and Asiatic brethren since what&rsquo;s happening now in relation to their ghettos and job prospects being raided, is only the beginning. </p>
<p>The &#8216;Middle Eastern&rsquo; benefactors and providers of black Affirmative Action and general preferential treatment goodies, will switch their loyalities and thus efforts to all-out Affirmative Action and preferential treatment for Hispanic people as this <i>minority</i> grows more prolific and vociferous, giving rise to greater block-voting power, etc. </p>
<p>Eventually, as I&rsquo;ve stated in a post a couple of months or so ago, blacks will, in the fullness of time, likely become enslaved once again at the hands of Latin Americans and various Asiatic ethnicities.</p>
<p>America will become another Cuba and/or Haiti, but without black social inclusion.</p>
<p>This is why it is imperative that politically aware white people start forming as many powerful lobbying organisations as they can at the present time with the goal of breaking up America and carving out territory for themselves before the sun sets on any chance of eventual liberty and independence for all white Americans.</p>

		<p>I can betcha that blacks, hispanics, gays and all these other &#8220;victim&#8221; groups didn&rsquo;t feel like victims until mostly (white) liberals told them they were.  </p>

		<p>It is astonishing that there is still no recognition of the simple fact that whites take refuge in handing over responsibility to those who complain most, and hope for the best. (example:S-Africa)<br>
Unfortunately, the basic difference in Microcephaline,a gene, regulating brain development,is not considered.(Science Vol.309, 9.September 2005)</p>
