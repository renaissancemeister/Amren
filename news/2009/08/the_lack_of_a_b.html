<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-aubrykaplan1-2009aug01,0,2381307.story">The Lack of a Black Agenda</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erin Aubry Kaplan, Los Angeles Times, August 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And yet, today, the fate of black folk is far from certain and is in some ways less secure than at any time in the last 100 years. Why? Blacks don&rsquo;t have an agenda. They have no lobby.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s empathy [when he addressed the NAACP last month] was heartening, and the crowd&rsquo;s connection with him was moving. But all of that is emotion. It is not a plan of action.</p>
<p>Ironically, one key reason black people don&rsquo;t have an action plan has to do with the middle class that Obama addressed. Growing divisions of class and expectations have stalled blacks in a crisis of inaction for decades, unable or unwilling to fight against the damning statistics  &mdash;  in health, education, incarceration, employment  &mdash;  of a black reality that has wounded us all. It&rsquo;s a reality that Obama articulated very clearly and soberly (and that he first articulated, though less forcefully, in his now-famous &#8220;race&#8221; speech last year). Obama understands that his singular success, far from pointing to a post-racial America, illuminates collective black failure like nothing else.</p>
<p>Most blacks believe that there is still racial inequality, and many of us experience it directly. We just don&rsquo;t agree on what to do about it. Though you wouldn&rsquo;t have known that last year, when blacks formed a rock-solid voting bloc behind Obama in the general election. {snip}</p>
<p>That was candidate Obama; President Obama is a different story. He&rsquo;s potentially part of the problem. It is the strivers, after all, who are in the best position to advocate for poorer blacks who need the most help. Yet they have failed to do so, in part perhaps because they perceive their less-fortunate brethren as having misplaced values that reflect badly on the race. (Obama channeled a bit of Cosby in his NAACP speech when he advised parents to &#8220;turn off the Xbox&#8221; and reclaim the community traditions that sustained us in the past.)</p>
<p>Other groups  &mdash;  Latinos, women, gays  &mdash;  have no problem agitating for the disenfranchised among them. They rightfully want to know where Obama stands on immigration, abortion, civil liberties, gay unions and marriage. Blacks have become uniquely convinced that such groupthink inhibits their success, that they can get a seat at the table only if they drop their interest in the less fortunate and politically problematic. Can Obama, a black man who&rsquo;s now heading the table, change this dynamic?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t count on it. Look what happened recently when Obama criticized the Cambridge, Mass., police for arresting and charging black scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. in what looked like a classic incident of racial profiling. Whites so objected to this critique  &mdash;  that is, to Obama reacting like an average black man instead of an &#8220;exceptional&#8221; one  &mdash;  that the president wound up qualifying his remarks. Of course, the president is also busy, mostly with trying to reverse a historic economic decline that&rsquo;s sinking us all.</p>
<p>And as aware as the president is that blacks have been under siege for decades  &mdash;  the jobless rate among black males nationwide is downright alarming  &mdash;  he hinted that he can&rsquo;t effect change by himself. One of the things the NAACP founders knew, Obama said, was that &#8220;presidents needed to be pressured into action.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>But our president does have an unprecedented opportunity to give racial inequality the prominence he says it still deserves. He could change the conservative paradigm that&rsquo;s gripped this country for too long and talk in racial specifics. He could put some muscle behind his declaration to the NAACP that poor education in the inner cities &#8220;is not a black or brown problem, it&rsquo;s an American problem.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And the music goes on and on and on.  &#8220;Race is a social construct, intelligence can&rsquo;t be defined so it can&rsquo;t be measured, all races are equal (what races?)all cultures are equal, all our problems are due to racist whites!&#8221;  This effort to deny or ignore significantly lower IQ and blame all problems on something (anything) else just never stops.  If anyone had an real idea for improving IQ they would rush to apply the idea to all races immediately! </p>
<p>Denial of IQ limitations also leads to an number of bad attitudes that exacerbate the problem further (to study is to act white, they owe us so why not steal and on and on).  Someone beyond Jared Taylor is going to have to sternly speak truth to the black and Latino communities one of these days, or we are forever caught up in this circular reasoning.</p>

		<p>Well, I knew they would eventually start saying Obama turned their backs on them. But one minute they are boasting about how they now rule the world, and the next minute they are still complaining that white America is still holding them back, and oppressing them. Now they are angry that Obama hasn&rsquo;t rewarded them enough for their votes.</p>
