<h1>Man Offers 40 Goats, 20 Cows for Chelsea Clinton</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, August 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What can 40 goats and 20 cows buy a Kenyan man? Chelsea Clinton&rsquo;s love, if you ask Godwin Kipkemoi Chepkurgor.</p>
<p>The Kenyan man first offered the dowry nine years ago to then-President Bill Clinton in asking for the hand of his only child. He renewed it Thursday after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked about the proposal at a Nairobi town hall session.</p>
<p>CNN&rsquo;s Fareed Zakaria, the session&rsquo;s moderator, commented that given the economic crisis at hand, Chepkurgor&rsquo;s dowry was &#8220;not a bad offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chepkurgor operates a small electronics and computer shop in Nakuru, a major city northwest of Nairobi. He may still be waiting for Chelsea, but he&rsquo;s not exactly single. He married his wife Grace, a college classmate, in 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Polygamy is legal in Kenya, so Chelsea would be Chepkurgor&rsquo;s second wife.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Kenya, a man proposes with dowry for the prospective bride, Chepkurgor explained. He said he stands by his initial livestock offer until someone makes a counteroffer.</p>
<p>Chepkurgor, now 39, first made his intentions known when all three Clintons visited East Africa in 2000. He wrote a letter to the former president, offering himself as his only child&rsquo;s suitor. He said he had not expected the secretary of state to address the issue during her visit to Kenya this week.</p>
<p>However, he admits his chances might be rather slim.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is for real.  I think he&rsquo;s &#8220;proposing&#8221; to Chelsea Clinton in hopes of her or somebody telling him no, so he can then whine about discrimination and racism.  He figures that the President of the United States has ancestral (if not more) links to Kenya, so it&rsquo;s time to re-start the hustle.</p>

		<p>Hey, you got to hand it to the guy, he is persistent. A lot of women like that. Although I am not sure that the Clintons want goats. They want cash. Besides, we know that liberals are all talk about race mixing, Chelsea married herself a good white boy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Love in Kenya, not exactly the stuff of a Bronte novel.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if Chepkurgor asked Chelsea, like Orson Welles did in Bronte&rsquo;s &#8220;Jane Eyre&#8221;, &#8220;do you find me attractive&#8221;?  And did Chelsea answer, &#8220;No Sir&#8221;? This probably isn&rsquo;t a consideration in Kenya.</p>

		<p>Kenya?  Did you say Kenya?  Allright Hillary!  Check you out!  One Kenyan makes you Secretary of State, another wants to make you an honest woman!  You go girl!  Kenya is, after all, THE hottest producer of biracial child stock.  They could totally live with you in newly integrated Westchester. </p>
<p>Man, this is making my sides hurt! </p>

&#8220;Love in Kenya: not exactly the stuff of a BrontÃ« novel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor is it the stuff that dreams are made of.</p>
<p>Courtly love and romance are purely European concepts.  White women must understand that White men are all that stands between them and those that would treat them as livestock.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here&rsquo;s what Chelsea&rsquo;s missing:</p>

		<p>Come on Chelsea, you&rsquo;ll LOVE living in Kenya, living in a shanty town and chasing down your daily meals for you AND your new husband. It&rsquo;s such a - - what would you call it- - &#8220;vibrant&#8221; country with a &#8220;rich cultural history&#8221;. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re the envy of many women in Kenya by having a man of such stature wanting your hand in marrage. I mean, 40 goats AND 20 cows!! What&rsquo;s stopping you! Go for it. You&rsquo;re not a &#8216;racissss&rsquo; now are you?</p>

		<p> Too bad the liberals have no sense of humor about things like this. Hillary could have made a face when reminded of the &#8220;proposal&#8221; during the town hall session and cried, &#8220;Gag me with a SPOON!&#8221; while making the appropriate finger-down-the-throat gesture.</p>
<p> Just what Chelsea Clinton needs   &mdash;   a Kenyan shopkeeper as a husband. Come to think of it, though, the one we&rsquo;ve got in the White House now is the product of a very similar union, when you think about it. Lock her in the closet, Hillary! Tell the Secret Service to be on the lookout for prowling Africans!</p>

		<p>Too bad Clinton didn&rsquo;t accept the deal.  We&rsquo;d have 40 more goats and 20 more cows in this country in exchange for one less Clinton.  Sounds good to me.<br>

		<p>I believe all liberal white men and women should be forcibly married to an African. Choosing one&rsquo;s spouse is so Eurocentric. Forced marriages and bride captures are vibrant and cool. Get with it, liberals!</p>

		<p>I think he&rsquo;s offering too many goats. Based on her father&rsquo;s line, and a quick physical assessment, I think eight goats and a cow is a generous offer.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful proposal, and Chelsea should jump at it.  After all, her parents have been telling us for a long time that diversity is strength.  Surely, they would practice what they preach.  And consider that the high-IQ kids she would have with this prominent Kenyan might someday invent the spacecraft that will explore the furthest reaches of the universe. (Humankind may need another place to live by then).  After all, Mr. Chepkurgor&rsquo;s ancestors gave the world so much&hellip;spoken and written languages, the arts and sciences, the culture of Egypt and by extension Greece and Rome, in short, the Western World, and we mean ole&rsquo; White Folks ran off and claimed it for ourselves.  At last, the bruthas will be coming back into their own.  How thrilling!!!  I just hope the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t slow down their space exploration.</p>

		<p>Not like a Bronte novel, the tagline says? No, at least he has some goats, representing the ability to provide for her.  That puts him a cut above Heathcliff.  You could go to the hood in the US, where the government does a large share of the providing, to find something more like a Bronte novel (where the biggest thug wins the girl&rsquo;s heart).</p>

		<p>I might have suspected Obama put him up to it to embarrass the Clintons but the article says this guy first made his proposal in 2000 long before anyone knew who Obama was.  The Clintons have no intention of letting their daughter marry down.  Liberals are big on talk pushing mixed race marriage and diversity as long as it doesn&rsquo;t affect them.  Liberalism is nothing but a dog and pony show where people put on an act for minorities in exchange for votes.  They&rsquo;re empowering these people to the detriment of their own power and it&rsquo;s coming full circle.  Look how diversity has been beneficial to Hillary&rsquo;s career, stuck in a subservient job to a black President she despises.  Sooner rather than later the whole power structure White liberals have built up will come crashing down. </p>

		<p>I know Bill Clinton is not popular among readers here but there&rsquo;s no way in hell he would allow his own blood to be joined with that of an African. Last I saw in the gossip pages, Chelsea was engaged to a White guy. How unfortunate that the Clinton&rsquo;s wont get to experience the joys of diversity in their own family! </p>
