			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Vanessa Allen, Daily Mail (London), August 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Worried parents are hiring security guards to escort their children home from school.</p>
<p>Mothers in middle-class suburbs have turned to the private patrols over fears that their children could be attacked.</p>
<p>The guards meet children from the school bus and ensure they reach their homes safely.</p>
<p>Abi Mohamed, head of a security firm in Hampstead, North-West London, said his company had been contacted by teenage girls who were too scared to go home alone.</p>
<p>His firm, Hocroft Trading and Security, already offered a &#8216;Meet and Greet&rsquo; service to women who felt vulnerable returning home alone and has now extended it to include their children.</p>
<p>The pupils use their mobile phones to call the security guards if they want an escort.</p>
<p>Mr Mohamed said: &#8216;Three 15-year-old girls started calling every single day. As soon as they come off the bus, we go and meet them and we will follow them home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said his firm received 25 to 30 calls a day. He believed a spate of robberies in Hampstead had increased the fear of crime, with women targeted as they let themselves into their homes.</p>
<p>Fashion designer Nicole Farhi was strangled until she passed out and had to plead with her attackers not to stab her.</p>
<p>Peter Williams, who runs private security firm London Community Services, said his guards also offered the &#8216;Meet and Greet&rsquo; service to women and would extend it to children if their parents wanted.</p>
<p>Mother-of-two Victoria Dennis, 34, said she often used Mr Williams&rsquo;s ex- Gurkha guards when she was returning home alone with her children.</p>
<p>She added: &#8216;When it&rsquo;s dark I call the Meet and Greet service on the school run so they&rsquo;re at my house to meet me. I would definitely use it for my children when they are older.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Private security is a Â£4.3billion industry in Britain, according to British Security Industry Association figures.</p>
<p>Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair has said Britain risks becoming like parts of South Africa where private guards are seen as essential for the middle-class and wealthy.</p>
<p>Detective Constable Reg Pickering, who headed an investigation that led to two brothers being jailed for a series of &#8216;strangulation robberies&rsquo; on wealthy women in London, said he believed the private firms canvassed robbery victims.</p>
<p>&#8216;They are providing a service and it reassures people that someone is going to be at their door when they return home,&rsquo; he added.<br>

		<p>Hampstead is something like the upper west side of New York and Beverly Hills, Malibu, Santa Monica, Brentwood Ca.  It is a very, very rich and ultra liberal section of London.</p>
<p>The wealthy liberals of London have totally detested and despised the White working and middle classes of England for centuries.  Hampstead is their headquarters.  It is also a center of gay activitism, the anti fox hunting movement, the anti not only hunting but anti fishing movement, vegans, global warming freakos and every type of anti White working class liberalism.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t happen to a more deserving neighborhood.  Too bad they can afford meet the school bus guards.  I&rsquo;d like to see them go through what the English working class has gone through beaten  robbed, raped and murdered by first caribbean blacks and now african blacks and muslims.</p>
<p>For decades, the pundits and pontificators defended the caribbean and then muslim murders, rapists, robbers and assaulters of the White working class. Now it has come to their neighborhood.  Good!!!</p>

		<p>Every week, as homework, my forth grade teacher would require us to cut out a news article and answer the following questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how.   As an Adult, I realize there is not enough information to answer all of these questions. That fact shows just how much political correctness has warped the news.</p>

<p>Seems extremely suspicious to me that a member of the same tribe that created the fear and violence is now running the primary business protecting againt it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reminicest of prohibition era Chicago where Mr Luciano would threaten to burn down your business then you&rsquo;d pay Mr Accardo for protection.</p>

		<p>If I were a woman in London, concerned for my safety and my childrens&rsquo; safety, I&rsquo;d consider hiring private security too.</p>
<p>After all, they couldn&rsquo;t possibly be worse than the eunuchs that go around masquerading as British law enforcement personnel.</p>

		<p>The Williams security guards are ex-Gurkhas, it would take a brave criminal to challenge one of these ex-soldiers who fought with us in both World Wars. All Gurkha soldiers are recruited in the Himalayan Kingdom of Nepal. </p>
<p>The Gurkhas have only been eligible for the Victoria Cross since 1911. During this time 26 have been awarded, 13 to British Officers and 13 to Gurkha Soldiers.</p>
<p>Four soldiers from the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles (1 RGR) were each awarded the Military Cross by the Queen in recognition for their individual acts of bravery in Kandahar, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Corporal Agnish Thapa, 27, was awarded his Military Cross for giving Australian troops an opportunity to withdraw from the enemy&rsquo;s killing area and dragging a mortally wounded solider 100 metres under intense enemy fire.</p>
<p>Us Aussies respect them enormously. </p>

		<p>Many American readers here are reporting on the irony of a man with a muslim name being in charge of a security firm.<br>
 However, I can state that muslims are usually not responsible for street robberies and other violent assaults on London&rsquo;s streets.<br>
 Blacks originally from the Carribean or Africa are usually the culprits.<br>

<p>Not only do Brits not have a Second Amendment, paisan, but the UK does not even have a written constitution. Their laws evolved from common law customs.</p>
<p>The Second Amendment is what separates the USA from every other country on Earth.  It is why a person without a gun in another country is a &#8220;subject&#8221;, while we in the USA who have guns, are citizens.</p>

<p>   It&rsquo;s interesting that a BBC &#8220;presenter&#8221; was the one attacked in the robbery. I wonder if this story would have gotten so much attention if the victim had been an ordinary citizen and not a member of the Fourth Estate? Will the BBC think twice about its multicultural propaganda &mdash; &ldquo;As a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to his folly.&rdquo; Bible</p>

		<p>Actually, this has been the norm in the U.S. for years now, except in our case, parents perform the security guard job as part of their daily routine, taking their kids to school and picking them up.  This is because gangs made walking even a block in one Northern California town I know of, too dangerous.</p>

		<p>ER - read my comment again. I said that Australians respect the Gurkha soldiers enormously for their courage. I didn&rsquo;t say that they should all be brought to Australia.</p>
<p>I am not for a multiracial country, neither am I an Anglo/Saxon. I&rsquo;m of Irish/French heritage and a fifth generation Australian.<br>

<p>Not quite.  As one British wit explained, the UK does indeed have a written constitution  &mdash;   just not all in the same place.</p>
<p><i>The Second Amendment is what separates the USA from every other country on Earth.  It is why a person without a gun in another country is a &#8220;subject&rdquo;, while we in the USA who have guns, are citizens.<i></i></i></p>
<p>Mexico has a &#8220;second amendment&#8221; in her constituion, according to David Kopel.  Switzerland does not, but the cantons keep active militias.  In which country are civilian guns safer?</p>
<p>The Second Amendment does not apply to the states, unless one invokes both the Fourteenth Amendment <i>and</i> the incorporation doctrine.  (Good luck with that!)  The 2nd only protects us from <i>federal</i> confiscation, not state confiscation.  However, the latter would violate the militia clauses in the body of the Constitution, which require states to supply a militia.</p>

&hellip;.there are 469 comments on this site, including questions on why it took GMA two days to mention this story, and then asking it was only reported as a &#8220;Cautionary Tale.&#8221; Along with the &#8220;Where are Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton Now?&#8221; and how would this have been reported if the races were reversed or if the victim was gay? type of comments.<br>
The comments on this story actually remind me of the very powerful, recent Amren &#8220;how I saw the light&#8221; thread.</p>

<p>&#8216;Defense attorney: blow didn&rsquo;t kill Crofton boy&rsquo;<br>
https://tinyurl.com/nt4l4t</p>
<p>Basically the Defense attorney is trying to get his client tried as a juvenile or get the case thrown out for problems with the original police report.<br>
Also according to one of the comments, &#8220;this 16 year old is being charged with MANSLAUGHTER, not murder. With a 10 year max manslaughter penalty in Maryland this means that worst case scenario, he&rsquo;ll be out and back on the streets of Crofton by the time he&rsquo;s 26 years old, possibly sooner with parole.&#8221;<br>
The defense lawyer tried to get his client off by saying that the killer blow was from the concrete and not from fists, but thankfully the Judge threw that request out based on a medical examiners report. </p>
