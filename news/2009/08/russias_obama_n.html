<h1>Russia&rsquo;s Obama: No, He Can&rsquo;t, At Least Not Now</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karina Ioffee, AP, August 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An African-born farmer is making an improbable run for office in Russia, inspired by President Barack Obama and undaunted by racial attitudes that have changed little in decades.</p>
<p>Joaquim Crima, a 37-year-old native of Guinea Bissau who settled in southern Russia after earning a degree at a local university, is promising to battle corruption and bring development to his district on the Volga River.</p>
<p>In Russia, a black man running for office is so unusual that Crima is being called &#8220;the Russian Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In truth, Crima&rsquo;s quest to be elected head of the Srednyaya Akhtuba district in October is highly unlikely, not least because he lacks the political capital and connections to make it happen. He faces the reality of being a black man in Russia, a country where racism and racial stereotypes are deeply ingrained.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Crima gets along well with his fellow townspeople, but to play it safe he is accompanied almost everywhere by his muscular brother-in-law.</p>
<p>Last December, a black American exchange student was stabbed and badly wounded in Volgograd, the nearest large city, in what was believed to be a racially motivated attack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Crima wanted to come to the Soviet Union because it supported his West African homeland when it gained independence in 1974. He describes Russia as a &#8220;great power&#8221; and admires Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. He married a local woman, learned to speak fluent Russian and earned his citizenship.</p>
<p>He farms 50 acres (20 hectares) of land, growing watermelons and other melons, which he and his wife sell along the town&rsquo;s main road. He employs about 20 people to help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Privately, however, some laugh at what they see as Crima&rsquo;s naivety. A department store saleswoman who refused to give her name said she would not vote for him because she doesn&rsquo;t want to &#8220;live in Africa.&#8221; Another said she would not vote for a black person.</p>
<p>In Russia, such baldly racist sentiments are common. Crima himself put up billboards that read: &#8220;I will toil like a Negro&#8221;  &mdash;  a phrase Russians use to mean they will work hard.</p>

		<p>Sure, Russia can have a black president, just as soon as there are lots of whites promoted to positions of power all over Africa.  I mean, we have to be fair, right?  That&rsquo;s what diversity of all about.</p>

		<p>This guy is the ultimate useful idiot. He&rsquo;d be better off if he ran for president of Guinea-Bissau. Maybe the fact that some people lack running water reminds him of home.</p>
<p>I fail to see how such statements as refusing to live in Africa, or never voting for a black are &#8220;baldly racist&#8221; statements. The Russian natives speaking them are simply stating their opinions. This goes to show that, for all the sacred pronouncements about a unity of brotherhood, equality, etc., promulgated by the old USSR, the average Ivan and Tatiana know the deal. They have less use for blacks in Russia, than Archie Bunker had for George Jefferson. My own father (who was born in what is now Belarus) would have made Theodore Bilbo look like a Kennedy-type liberal on race matters. </p>

		<p>My husband, who came here, to the United States from Russia 4 years ago saw this article somewhere else, probably in a Russian online newspaper. He about wet himself laughing. <br>
There are 2 ways blacks are thought of in Russia.<br>
They are either hated and reviled or they are looked upon as the Shufflin&rsquo; Rastus Minstrel Show.<br>
My husband also said He better watch his @$$ because young Russians ae very pro-white Russian nationalists that do not look kindly upon blacks in their country. <br>
Most of the blacks there know they are not wanted and even in danger there so they don&rsquo;t much leave their lairs.</p>

		<p>He admires the Russians so much that he decided to migrate over there and participate in the extermination of white people through miscegenation.  I wonder how many Russian men have settled in his African nation, taken local wives and settled down.  Probably NONE.  In short, he is just another foot soldier in the one-way transport of African spores all over the world.  A pawn in the new world order.  If he truly loves Russia, he&rsquo;ll go back to Africa - along with his self-hating wife.</p>

<p>Exactly. If 75+ years of communist propaganda haven&rsquo;t wiped out &#8220;racism&#8221; (or even put a dent in it) what will? What is seventy-five years of propaganda anyway compared to thousands of years of reality? Yet, was it not the communists/socialists that were and still are lecturing us about what racists we are in the West? They can&rsquo;t even end it in their own countries. &#8220;Racism&#8221; is merely the recognition of reality.</p>

		<p>This is hysterical. I have a colleague who just came back from a concert tour in the St. Pete area, arranged by the powers that be OVER THERE, where he was feted, and listened to with rapture.. even singing songs in Russian! While over here in the USA, he is relatively ignored by, the &#8216;artist PTB&rsquo;- where he can&rsquo;t even get a NY audition, all the while slaving at a college in the Midwest.</p>
<p>His comment to me was that every one of the professionals whom he met (who are literate, bi/tri-lingual, conversant with the failed experiment known as Marxism, asked him bluntly, &#8216;How is N***er Presidyent?&rsquo; in that thick slavic accent they all have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not racism, it&rsquo;s awareness that Obama is merely another Marxist in &#8216;white face,&rsquo; that they don&rsquo;t belong in Europe, and how long will it take until we Americans who are like them, drive them and the &#8216;internationalists&rsquo; out of OUR LANDS, just as they did theirs, after seventy-plus years of serfdom.</p>
<p>Gee, reading this column, I&rsquo;d like to ask, how can I emigrate, Tovarish?</p>

		<p>I sincerely hope that this naive fool is not killed while running for office. He seems like a simpleton, utterly unaware of the strong nationalist streak of Russians and their dislike of Africans. </p>
<p>Even during the USSR, the Communists would bring in students from Africa to be indoctrinated and to be used as agents for Soviet interests in the home countries. While in Russia, these dupes were harassed and beaten, despite the classless, universal defender of human rights they were told about the Soviet Union. </p>

		<p>The multiculturalism and open borders tactics are indeed a New World Order agenda designed to destroy EVERY white nation on the planet including all ancestral European white homelands as well.</p>
<p>One can even feel the arrogance and air of cocksuredness emanating from all non-whites from whatever part of the globe when they manage to successfully invade, whether legally or illegally, every white nation on the face of the earth. </p>
<p>The illegals amongst them either conceal their identities and whereabouts or use the corrupt Human Rights Act to stay planted firmly in countries they don&rsquo;t belong in nor have any rights to be in to begin with.</p>
<p>Once established, they then proceed readily aided and abetted by our own traitors, to either set up or join self-interest organisations to further their non-white agendas of territorial, theft, dispossession and disenfranchisement of the native white populations using wholesale racial discrimination, denial of our inalienable human rights as indigenious peoples which is a United Nations listed crime, and every kind of physical violence against us in order to achieve their illegal goals.</p>
<p>The non-whites would not wear it when the boot on the other foot and after recovering their territories, proceeded to unleash a vendetta of racist rape and genocide upon the lingering whites on their territories or in most cases kicked them out. To-date, no cases for mass rape, mass murder and genocide perpetrated by non-whites against whites whether committed in non-white or white homelands, has ever been commenced and it&rsquo;s time they were.</p>
<p>It has got to be stopped and if it takes a nuclear solution to achieve it, so be it. I&rsquo;m willing to perish for such a noble and just cause as the inalienable rights of survival and self-rule, and the preservation of birthright homeland for every race of people on the planet.<br>

		<p>Russia is losing almost a MILLION of its native born a year to emigration because of the economic situation. WHY would they let in immigrants, let alone AFRICAN immigrants? I&rsquo;ve heard of central Asians (from former soviet republics) migrating to Russia for work but I have a feeling that is more because Moscow wants to keep them dependent on remittances more than any NEED for labor. Russians are well known to be &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; (read: proud nationalists) so its very saddening to hear about Blacks that far north. </p>

		<p><i>I&rsquo;ve heard of central Asians (from former soviet republics) migrating to Russia for work but I have a feeling that is more because Moscow wants to keep them dependent on remittances more than any NEED for labor.</i></p>
<p>In this case Russians have not much justification to complain. There are millions of Russians in some of these Central Asian nations - Kazakhstan&rsquo;s population for instance is over 30% Russian. Remember ethnic cleansing could run both ways. In any case I have heard that relations between Russians and Kazakhs is quite good - in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>In any case Russia  today as defined by its political boundaries is not white (the Russians as an ethnic group however are white), - up to 20% of its population are non-white, not recent immigrants, but people who were directly colonized by the Russians, with at least as much right to be in Russia as any white Russian.</p>
<p>As for the Chinese in the Far East - many of these lands were part of China just over a century ago anyway - and Russians in the Far East do depend on the Chinese to stimulate the economy there - in short they love and hate the Chinese at the same time.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day, Vladisvostok, Khabarovsk and all of Outer Manchuria will return to the Chinese family.</p>
<p>Having said that I do like the Russian people I have met- very genuine, tough people - not full of themselves like individualistic Americans (who all seem to yearn to be &#8216;special&rsquo; or famous and act out on this in various obnoxious ways).</p>

<p>Russia has at least as much claim to its territories as China does to Tibet or Xinjiang. You dislike Americans but patronize sites like AmRen. You &#8220;like&#8221; Russians but want their national territory. You probably live in the west too like a hypocrite.</p>

		<p><i>Russia has at least as much claim to its territories as China does to Tibet or Xinjiang.</i></p>
<p>Chinese involvment, influence, and rule over these two regions extends back to over 1000 years ago.</p>
<p>Most importantly Chinese did not ethnically cleanse these two areas of their non-Chinese inhabitants, as the Russians did with the original Manchurian Chinese and Korean inhabitants of the Far East.</p>
<p>Tibetans and Uighurs are still a significant proportion of the territories of Tibet and Xinjiang respectively.</p>
<p><i>You &ldquo;like&rdquo; Russians but want their national territory.</i></p>
<p>There is no inconsistency here. No problem with liking people on a personal day to day interaction basis, but be opposed to their countries policies. One can &#8216;like&rsquo; Americans but still be opposed to their Iraq military adventure.</p>
<p>I love Russian music too - especially the stuff their Red Army choir puts out.</p>
<p><i>You dislike Americans but patronize sites like AmRen.</i></p>
<p>I like to read all views, and love to argue.</p>
<p><i>You probably live in the west too like a hypocrite.</i></p>
<p>I live in Hong Kong. Hypocrisy by the way implies a moral double standard. So even if I did live in the West, criticizing the West from within the West would not necessarily be hypocritical at all - only if my criticisms in themselves applied a double moral standard. </p>
