<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1210129/One-killers-immigrant.html">One out of Every Five Killers Is an Immigrant</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Hickley and Jason Bennetto, Daily Mail (London), August 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Up to a fifth of killers in England and Wales are foreign, police figures suggest. Out of 371 individuals accused or convicted of murder or manslaughter last year, 79 were from abroad  &mdash;  more than 21 per cent.</p>
<p>Foreign immigrants make up only around a tenth of the UK population, meaning they are statistically twice as likely as native Britons to be charged with or found guilty of an illegal killing.</p>
<p>In London, almost 40 per cent of those in such cases in the past year were from overseas, or of unknown origin.</p>
<p>Opposition critics said the findings reflected the Government&rsquo;s failure to deport foreign criminals, and the ease with which offenders from abroad can slip through border controls.</p>
<p>The most common nationality for foreigners involved in murder and manslaughter cases was Polish, followed by Nepalese, Lithuanian, Somalian and Sri Lankan.</p>
<p>Around half the police forces across England and Wales provided data under the Freedom of Information Act, revealing strong regional differences.</p>
<p>The highest figures were in London where in the year to April 2009, 93 of the 233 people accused or convicted of murder and manslaughter were either non-British or from unknown backgrounds.</p>
<p>In West Mercia, five out of 22 were foreigners  &mdash;  23 per cent  &mdash;  from Lithuania, Poland, and the Republic of Ireland. Nottinghamshire showed the same proportion, with three out of 13 cases.</p>
<p>But some forces  &mdash;  including Cheshire, Humberside, Hampshire, and Merseyside  &mdash;  recorded no cases with foreign killers. The figures may be an underestimate as 11 out 30 forces which responded claimed they did not record nationalities of either killers or murder victims, and others had gaps in the information.</p>
<p>As foreign suspects are typically harder to identify and trace, meaning that crimes are less likely to be solved, the real proportion could be significantly higher.</p>
<p>The figures showed foreigners were also more likely to be victims of murder or manslaughter, accounting for 20 per cent of all those killed in England and Wales in 2007-8, and 13 per cent last year.</p>
<p>Concerns about convicted offenders entering Britain were underlined in April by the case of Marek Harcar, 33, who was sentenced to a minimum 25 years in jail for the abduction, rape and murder of businesswoman Moira Jones.</p>
<p>Slovakian Harcar was allowed into Britain despite having 13 convictions, four of them involving violence. He abducted the 40-year-old just yards from her home on May 28 last year. Her semi-naked body was found in Queen&rsquo;s Park in Glasgow the next day.</p>
<p>Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said: &#8216;The Government seem to have completely failed to get to grips with foreign nationals&rsquo; crime in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8216;These figures underline the scale of the problem, but we know the Government are simply failing to deport offenders in the way they should be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Earlier this year Detective Chief Inspector Murray Duffin, of the Scotland Yard Extradition and Intelligence Unit, warned: &#8216;Britain is becoming a magnet for increasing numbers of criminals from the former Eastern bloc countries which are now members of the EU.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>The scary part:<br>
These are just the <i>foreign-born</i> non-Britons - I wonder how high the figures would be if second- and third-generation ones were included too?</p>

		<p>And what proportion of the rest were born here but of foriegn parents/grand parents and so classed as British?</p>
<p>Going by names and pictures when published in the press. Most of them<br>

		<p> I love the statements allowing that the statistics for foreign-born murderers could possibly be higher (basically, because nobody&rsquo;s really counting).</p>
<p>Something that Hickley and Bennetto seem to have omitted is that many (or most) of the murders not committed by the foreign-born may have been committed by the children and grandchildren of the foreign-born.</p>
<p>One has to wonder whether &#8216;criminals from the former Eastern-Bloc countries&rsquo; might be code for &#8216;Roma People&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Keeping statistics by race, ethnicity, or national origin clearly has to go, as it is racist on two grounds:</p>
<p>1) disparate impact<br>
2) hateful toward non-whites and foreigners.</p>

		<p>Tell us something we don&rsquo;t know.We have over here a monthly  TV programme called &#8220;CrimewatchUK&#8221; that features re-enactments of the most heinous recent crimes.It goes without saying that 95%<br>
of the perpetrators are either black or asian in origin.I was<br>
suprised to see that the released information made no mention<br>
of the Albanians,who now enjoy a virtual monopoly of the <br>
prostitution industry and the relatively low position of the <br>
Somalis made me suspect that the survey&rsquo;s methodology might<br>
not have been as rigorous as hoped.</p>

		<p>I would take these figures with a big, big, grain of salt. Non-Whites have been pouring into Great Britain since 1948 when the treasonous Marxist Labour party let them in. You could very easily have huge numbers of Jamacian-blacks born in Britain who the government would place as &#8220;British&#8221; who could be committing an awful lot of crime. A TRUE crime population breakdown would be indigenous British people (obviously Whites), other European Whites (indigenous to at least the continent of Europe if not the British isles) and then ALL the non-Whites (irrespective of whether or not they were born in the U.K.). I would even be willing to have a fourth category for &#8220;muslims&#8221; and put White Albanians into it. Trying to get TRUE BRITISH statistics is now very hard. And the government has every reason to blur the matter anyways.</p>
