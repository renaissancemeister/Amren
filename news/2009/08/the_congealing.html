<h1><a href="https://www.aei.org/article/100860">The Congealing Pot  &mdash;  Today&rsquo;s Immigrants Are Different From Waves Past</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Richwine, National Review, August 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They&rsquo;re not just like the Irish  &mdash;  or the Italians or the Poles, for that matter. The large influx of Hispanic immigrants after 1965 represents a unique assimilation challenge for the United States. Many optimistic observers have assumed  &mdash;  incorrectly, it turns out  &mdash;  that Hispanic immigrants will follow the same economic trajectory European immigrants did in the early part of the last century. Many of those Europeans came to America with no money and few skills, but their status steadily improved. Their children outperformed them, and their children&rsquo;s children were often indistinguishable from the &#8220;founding stock.&#8221; The speed of economic assimilation varied somewhat by ethnic group, but three generations were typically enough to turn &#8220;ethnics&#8221; into plain old Americans.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;People used to say the Irish or the Poles would always be poor, but look at them today!&#8221; For Hispanics, we are led to believe, the same thing will happen.</p>
<p>But that claim isn&rsquo;t true. Though about three-quarters of Hispanics living in the U.S. today are either immigrants or the children of immigrants, a significant number have roots here going back many generations. We have several ways to measure their intergenerational progress, and the results leave little room for optimism about their prospects for assimilation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The children of Hispanic immigrants (the second generation) actually stay in school much longer and earn a considerably higher wage than their parents. In fact, the Hispanic rate of assimilation from the first to the second generation is only slightly lower than the assimilation rate of more successful groups of immigrants. Most second-generation Hispanics make up nearly as much ground as the children of European immigrants would if they grew up in the same disadvantaged situation.</p>
<p>But the good news ends there, and two problems arise. {snip} [Assimilation] appears to stall after the second generation. We see little further ladder-climbing from the grandchildren of Hispanic immigrants. They do not rise out of the lower class.</p>
<p>The most straightforward statistical evidence of this stall in Hispanic assimilation comes from the Current Population Survey (CPS), which asks respondents their ethnicity, where they were born, and where their parents were born. From this information we can construct an account of the first generation (foreign-born), the second generation (born in the U.S. with at least one foreign-born parent), and the &#8220;3+&#8221; generations (born in the U.S. to two U.S.-born parents) among the Hispanic respondents.</p>
<p>This chart shows how Hispanic Americans compare with white natives generation by generation. The annual earnings of second-generation Hispanic men are substantially higher than those of the first generation. However, the 3+ generations have about the same earnings as the second, still well below white natives. No generational progress beyond the second generation is evident.</p>
<p>The educational picture does not look much better. The children of Hispanic immigrants are much better educated than their parents. However, American-born Hispanics still have high dropout and low college-completion rates compared with white natives, and there is little improvement from the second to the 3+ generations. Again, progress stalls.</p>
<p>These results do not depend on the time period considered. {snip}</p>
<p>The studies discussed so far are cross-sectional  &mdash;  statistical snapshots captured at single points in time. Since each of the generations being compared lives in the same era, the second-generation respondents are not the actual children of the first generation, nor are the third-generation respondents the children of the second. But longitudinal studies  &mdash;  taking one cohort of Hispanic immigrants, then examining their children and their children&rsquo;s children over several decades  &mdash;  tell a similarly pessimistic story.</p>
<p>Economist James P. Smith pieced together census and CPS data starting in 1940 and ending in 1997. He was able to compare eight different immigrant birth cohorts with their children and grandchildren in later years. Smith found that, contrary to the cross-sectional studies, the Hispanic educational deficit relative to whites did become smaller between the second and 3+ generations. {snip} Did the educational gains for Hispanics affect their relative earning power?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For Mexicans in particular the picture is even worse. In five of the six most recent birth cohorts, the Mexican 3+ generations earn a marginally lower fraction of the white-native wage than does the second generation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, the research on Hispanic assimilation presents two possible conclusions. Either Hispanic assimilation will be exceedingly slow  &mdash;  taking at least four or five generations, and probably several more  &mdash;  or it will not happen. In either case, Hispanic immigration will have a serious long-term consequence: The grandchildren of today&rsquo;s Hispanic immigrants will lag far behind the grandchildren of today&rsquo;s white natives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That assimilation has stalled even among third-generation Hispanics growing up today is especially sobering. In the early 20th century, the quality of schools varied greatly, high-school graduation was unusual, travel was relatively difficult, and universities and employers were free to discriminate based on ethnicity. Today all but the worst inner-city schools are well funded, high-school graduation is expected, traveling around the country to look for work is much easier, and affirmative-action programs give preferences to Hispanics. Despite these advantages over earlier immigrants, today&rsquo;s Hispanics have not closed the socioeconomic gap with white natives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The consequences of a large ethno-cultural group&rsquo;s lagging behind the majority in education and income are significant. In strictly economic terms, perpetually poor immigrants and their descendants will be a major strain on social spending and infrastructure. Health care, public education, welfare payments, the criminal justice system, and programs for affordable housing will all require more tax dollars. When pro-immigration conservatives declare that these government programs should be scaled back or eliminated entirely, I am sympathetic. But a large public sector is a reality that cannot be wished away  &mdash;  we will not be abolishing Medicaid or public schools anytime soon. Immigration policy needs to take that reality into account.</p>
<p>Even if economics were not a concern, the lack of Hispanic assimilation is likely to create ethnic tensions that threaten our cultural core. Human beings are a tribal species, and this makes ethnicity a natural fault line in any society. Intra-European ethnic divisions have been largely overcome through economic assimilation  &mdash;  Irish and Italian immigrants may have looked a bit different from natives, but by the third generation their socioeconomic profiles were similar. Hispanic Americans do not have that benefit.</p>
<p>Persistent ethnic disparities in socioeconomic status add to a sense of &#8220;otherness&#8221; felt by minorities outside the economic mainstream. {snip} For example, a Pew Hispanic Center Survey in 2002 asked American-born Hispanics &#8220;which terms they would use first to describe themselves.&#8221; Less than half (46 percent) said &#8220;American,&#8221; while the majority said they primarily identified either with their ancestral country or as simply Hispanic or Latino. {snip} It is difficult to see how a unifying national culture can be preserved and extended in that environment.</p>

		<p>Europeans were able to assimilate into Anglo-American society for several very important reasons: 1) common racial stock; 2) a common European civilization; 3) lack of government codling (my grandfather couldn&rsquo;t start school UNTIL he spoke English; 4)discrimination (act like a foreigner and you would not be accepted in the broader society); 5) Immigration breaks (the big wave of early XIX century German immigration, the Chinese exclusion act of the late XIX century and the Eastern/Southern European wave of the early XX century which ended in 1922.  These waves of immigration were stopped when it appeared the US might be swamped); and 6) the desire of European immigrates to become American (no longer desired or encouraged by todays invaders).</p>
<p>The melting pot only worked because the vast bulk of European immigrants were Christian.  They were racially white.  The beauty of America was the ability to get the different European ethnicities (who fought among themselves) to become American.  We have never and will never assimilate blacks - the racial differences are to large.  We will never assimilate Mestizos or Muslims.  Race matters.</p>
<p>I am an AMERICAN.  My family history may be Hungarian but my heart is American.  I am glad my family assimilated.  Washington, Jefferson and Franklin are MY founding fathers.  And yes, I consider Great Britain to be the &#8216;mother&#8221; country.</p>

		<p>The majority of Hipanics in the US are Mexican and the vast majority of Mexicans have at least some Amerindian ancestry. And I&rsquo;m sure most AMREN readers are aware of the fact that Amerindians, including those born and rasied in fully developed countries like our own, have an average IQ of about 89. Simply having Spanish as as your native tongue or ancestors who did and possesing a Spanish surname is NOT the explanation as to why a disproportinate percentage of (3rd generation +) Hispanics have not assimilated into the middle class. Why then do Cubans in Florida, who come from a very similar &#8220;culture&#8221; as Mexicans,  have higher annual incomes, and are better educated than the latter group? Could it be that most are primarily European in ancestory and therefore have IQs not dismilar from &#8220;founding stock&#8221; Americans, as well as the Irish, Italians and Poles, groups which average about 100 on intelligence tests&hellip; </p>

<p>Yes, and they&rsquo;re not doing so because, unlike most of the European immigrants in years past, they are coming from third world hell holes where customs and traditions are on a primitive level.</p>

		<p>Stop with this insanity of &#8220;assimilating&#8221; other races. I am so tired of hearing these talk show hosts thinking that not assimilating is the problem!!  It is NOT. It will not work because it wasn&rsquo;t meant to work.   Only Europeans can assimilate with each other because they are all of the WHITE race. </p>

<p>This is true. And if my Italian immigrant grandparents arrived here in 1965 instead of 1905, I doubt my prospects would be any better. Immigrants from Latin America will never assimilate like my people did for many reasons, one of which is the very close proximity of Mexico. My Grandparents cut off all ties with Italy once they were here. This speeds assimilation. But I think a huge reason for this lack of assimilation of immigrants after 1965 is there are simply not the same level of opportunities now. Let&rsquo;s face it, the job market sucks, and it has sucked for quite a while now. Good paying blue-collar union jobs have gone the way of the dinosaur. These were jobs (and plentiful jobs) that anyone with a limited education could get and make a decent living for their family. This gives their children a definite leg-up in life. My parents were able to pay off a house in a middle class neighborhood, and send me to college because they got in on the good wages and benefits of the 1950&rsquo;s - 1970&rsquo;s. Yeah, the educational opportunities are available for the children of Latino immigrants, but what kind of jobs await them? Washing dishes? Walmart? Picking lettuce? I&rsquo;m making about the same wages now as I did in 1980, even after going back to school repeatedly and upgrading my education, and I know a lot of other white, college educated Americans are in the same boat. Our elected officials have NOT done well by us.  </p>

		<p>I find this hard to believe because we are all the same &hellip;Right? Every non-white has the same IQ and creative abilities as whites&hellip;.Right? I mean thats what our delusional western governments and academics tell us. <br>
There is only one reason these brown hispanic immigrants can&rsquo;t get ahead and that reason is WHITE RACISM!! It&rsquo;s the same reason why mexico is such a currupt sewer&hellip;.WHITE RACISM!!<br>
If blacks and browns where given the same oppurtunities as whites in America we would be exploring the milky way by now.<br>
When I see a black person or brown hispanic I say to myself there goes a future scientist. <br>
Those dam racist whites!</p>

		<p>Immigration, integration, assimilation, numerical domination=invasion!!!</p>
<p>Other than the the 2050 talk (which isn&rsquo;t exactly positive), you don&rsquo;t really here much talk about ratio&rsquo;s, quantifications and most importantly limitations!</p>
<p>Well when the conversation is limited to notions of &#8216;culture&rsquo; only and when all the &#8216;racist witch hunting&rsquo; is only politely conducted internally by Whites (which simply disarms us, making Whites easy target for those who covert our achievements and phenotype to the point of destroying us.)<br>
And when the mainstream, politically motivated point of view is that there&rsquo;s not enough biological differences in us humans to divide us into racial categories, barring if you work in medicine. <br>
The politically polite view means we look at our similarities rather our differences (we share 92-94% DNA with &#8216;fruit&rsquo; and 96-98% DNA with &#8216;Chimps.&rsquo;)<br>
It&rsquo;s a nice inclusive way of looking at the World because everyone can take credit for everything i.e. Pygmy tribesman can say &#8220;we (humans) invited electricity.&#8221; <br>
Of course it also takes away any notions of superiority from one group over another. Instead of &#8216;pigeon holing&rsquo; us all into categories we&rsquo;re all poured into the same one bucket(or &#8216;pot&rsquo;.)</p>
<p>The problem with this is when you mix lots of different objects together, collectively &#8216;the mass&rsquo; gets defined by it&rsquo;s lowest common dominator (the bar gets lowered for us all). And we can all see how sleazy our collective societies are becoming and how selfish we all are.<br>
In 50 years we&rsquo;ve gone from being producers to consumers.   </p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done the same with our culture, we say that the modern 1st World Western society is the all the Worlds culture.<br>
&#8220;Roll up, roll up, come one, come all!&#8221;<br>
We&rsquo;re taking credit away from ourselves and guiltily denying our part in creating our own societies, while inviting ethnically cohesive peoples with higher birth rates and dogmatic beliefs to integrate (where&rsquo;s the need once they establish their own large enclaves?).<br>
All you have to do is stretch out the time line to see what the result will be there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all so idealistic and experimental, yet we&rsquo;re plowing ahead with fingers crossed that&rsquo;ll all work out.<br>
With the ignorant, arrogance of the left who are working (successfully so far) with big business and our greedy tax collecting Governments in silencing all contrary opinions. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very flattering to say we all have the same potential, but what if its not true, then what?<br>
It&rsquo;ll be too late to turn back the clock, well peacefully.<br>
And with all the feminizing brainwashing that our young men are getting and the &#8216;don&rsquo;t be racist&rsquo; and mate with everyone message our young woman are getting, it all sounds pretty dire.</p>
<p>We Whites just need some cohesion too (and self pride), but without the &#8216;hate&rsquo; label attached.<br>
Maybe we need a left-wing type movement (not Democratic political party or tree huggers per se), but a internally focused, positive and introspective rebuild. It&rsquo;s an backwards step in some ways and an admission that control is being lost. But it would be hard to stop, surely.  <br>
Anything to break the: <br>
Hispanic group=Hispanics only,<br>
Black group=Blacks only,<br>
American group=&rsquo;everyone,&rsquo;&hellip;.(we are maybe 5-10yrs behind you)<br>
White group=hate, <br>
dynamic.</p>

		<p>Mexicans don&rsquo;t assimilate because they are encouraged not to assimilate. Our schools are happy to teach them in Spanish. Teachers waste class time celebrating any and every other culture while denigrating U.S. history ( Columbus was a genocidal maniac, the Founding Fathers were all wicked slave owners, etc.) </p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget that every college campus (in California anyway) has its own branch of La Raza and Mecha to remind hispanic students how mexico owned all the land up to the Arctic Circle until cruel Europeans stole the land out from under their feet.</p>
<p>Add all this to their glorification of gang &#8220;culture&#8221; that they pass down from generation to generation and it&rsquo;s pretty easy to understand why these people aren&rsquo;t turning into the model Americans our politicians insist they can be.   </p>

		<p>Assimilation has been the death of America. </p>
<p>Even in 1900 the adverse effects of importing Germans and Scandinavians and Irish were visible in the hollowing out of Anglo-British culture which was by that time observable. <br>
This is an unseen unwinding of social capital in terms of folkways, shared songs, stories and remembrances, and feelings of belonging. In its place comes &#8216;public principles&rsquo; and loyalty to the State, and that great monstrous abstraction, &#8220;America&#8221; - which means a different thing in every person&rsquo;s mouth. Yes, the newly arrived foreigner loves to trump his principles relating to &#8220;America&#8221;, just as our idealists love to have him as a soldier in their crusading army - whatever the cause. What was once merely a territory inhabited by a people becomes a symbolic social touchstone uniting its disparate inhabitants in bonds of abstract loyalty - to some concept, malleable by the latest newspaper editorials: &#8220;America&#8221;. </p>
<p>I know that people of these groups will feel differently, but that is also precisely the point. They view their forefather&rsquo;s prerogatives as being more important than the previous Anglo-British nation in existence before their arrival. They also view their contributions as being of paramount importance, especially if they settled some towns and contributed an inventor or cuisine. With that their admission to the highest legitimacy is secured, in their eyes. Anyone who insinuates otherwise is an enemy, perhaps a traitor (?). Right?</p>
<p>Well, guess what? Every other newly arrived immigrant thinks the exact same way as you do.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Assimilation&#8221; of non-White populations is a dangerous notion and it should not be encouranged or pursued as a goal. The Poles, Irish, Swedes, etc. of yesteryear &#8220;assimilated&#8221; into American culture by intermarrying with the Brits and Germans that comprised the founding stock. Is that really what any White person wants with today&rsquo;s immigrant hordes of Mestizos, Koreans, Chinese, Hmong, Nigerians, and Jamaicans? </p>
<p>Assimilation means certain death for the European stock. Be wary of any &#8220;White&#8221; persons who pushes for assilimation   &mdash;   anyone who does so is a &#8220;useful idiot&#8221; for the puppetmasters.</p>

Our elected officials have NOT done well by us. &#8220;</p>
<p>I certainly agree with the above statement.  Wages have stagnated since the late 1970&rsquo;s. No pundits and pontificators ever mention it, but the working class boom times of 1940 to 1970 had its roots in the anti immigration legislation of the 1920&rsquo;s and the low birthrate during the depression of the 30&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Employers were forced to create decently paid secure jobs because they did not have the vast 19th century oversupply of Europeans eager to work for starvation wages in the promised land.  But since 1965 of course, employers have not just the population of Europe, but of Asian, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East pouring in eager to work for any wages.</p>
<p>And Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras etc are so close.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed is all these college graduates whose only hope for a decent job is typing speed of 50 WPM and expertize on Microsoft Office.  They waste  4 years in college and $100,000 in tuition and living expenses and they get what?</p>
<p>The same job their grandmothers got back in 1950 right out of high school.  The only difference in that their grandmothers were called secretaries and they are called assistants.  Their grandmothers didn&rsquo;t waste 4 years of their young adult life in college and certainly didn&rsquo;t spend a fortune in tuition and living expenses.  And their grandmothers had some job security, unlike the administrative assistants of today who are often laid off every couple years.</p>
<p>It is shocking how many college graduates work for minimum wage in retail.  At my neighborhood Borders Bookstore, the $7.00 per <br>
hour clerks in charge of the computer and technology sections are White American men who graduated in computer programming and engineering but can&rsquo;t get jobs in their field because only Indians and Asians need apply.</p>
<p>Every economist in history has always said, the bigger the supply, the lower the value of a commodity.  We, the workers are a commodity and immigration lowers our value every year.</p>
<p>My sister and are are younger baby boomers.  We finished college in 1975 and 1977.  We both had to get jobs teaching English in Japan as there were no jobs avaliable for our cohort of graduates. Our parents were still working.  The older baby boomers who graduated in the 1960&rsquo;s had the rest of the jobs. There were few opportunities for our age group other than grad school.</p>
<p>My sister once mentioned that it would be easier for our children because our kids would not be baby boomers.  It didn&rsquo;t turn out that way.  Americans lowered our birthrate to provide a better life for the few children we had. The employers just turned to the rest of the world for an over supply of exploited, surplus workers.</p>

		<p>Agree with the previous poster about assimilation not being so wonderful.  When my ancestors arrived on this continent, there was no United States.  And guess what?  They spoke English.  There are still some of us here.</p>

Assimilation has been the death of America. </p>
<p>&#8220;Even in 1900 the adverse effects of importing Germans and Scandinavians and Irish were visible in the hollowing out of Anglo-British culture which was by that time observable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Back in 1910, the police commissioner of New York City, a man named Bingham published statistics that noted that 85 percent of the crime in New York City was committed by immigrants.</p>
<p>And of course there is the great police hero Petrosino, chief of the NYC mafia squad.  The New York and Italian police established a program whereby the Italian, especially Sicilian police would send a list of all Sicilian convicted criminals to Ellis Island. Immigration officialc would then be able to send convicted felons back to Sicily Petrosino was in Sicily compiling the list of convicted criminals when he was shot down by the mafia.</p>
<p><br>
Police corruption was epidemic in many cities right up to 1970 and there is still a lot of it,especially in the big east coast and midwestern cities. That corruption began in the 1840&rsquo;s by the mainly Irish police forces.  Why you might ask were these mainly Irish police forces so corrupt?  The reason is that the Irish police were generally immigrants or the sons of immigrants and grossly under paid.  As late as the 1920&rsquo;s, a New York City police officer with a wife and just 2 children was below the official poverty line.</p>
<p>The Boston police strike reveals some of the working conditions of 19th and early 20th century police officers.  96 hour weeks and only 2 days off per month and wages below the poverty line.  Police officers were paid less than any other government workers including janitors and not just skilled construction workers but the unskilled laborers who did nothing but carry material to the skilled workers and clean up. </p>
<p>The Irish were naturally intelligent enough to pass the police exams.  They spoke English unlike most of the immigrants.  Their potato diet did not harm them, they were much taller and more robust than the English working class of the time.  So they did have the basic qualifications to be police officers.</p>
<p>But, and I cannot emphasize this enough, the main motivation cities hired so many FOB Irish as police officers is that they were cheap, cheap, cheap.  Those 19th and early 20th century Irish American police were as corrupt as Latin American police are today.  And for the same reason; the salary was miniscule but the opportunities for corruption were vast.  The pay was not the official scale, it&rsquo;s what each officer could make through corruption.<br>

		<p>My family background is Catholic and I am part French and part Polish.  We came to this country with the understanding that it was primarily White Anglo Saxon Protestant.  Because that culture was successful, we assimilated its values.  I do think it was easier for us to do, because there was a large ocean separating my ancestors from Europe, but what made it easiest was that we were also White.  </p>
<p>North Asians are intelligent and hard-working easily adapting the Protestant work ethic.  Blacks and mestizos will never assimilate, lacking both the intelligence and the ethic.  </p>
<p>The smartest thing to do would have been to repatriate the blacks back to Africa and severely limit the mestizos to temporary employment, allowing them seasonal migrant work and then making them return home and build their own infrastructure in Mexico during the off season.  But our business elite are too addicted to cheap, illegal laborr and our political elite like a built in electorate who will keep putting them back into power for the welfare benefits they will give them.  </p>

		<p>Assimilation of non-white people into White American gene pool would be the last nail in the coffin. They must be kept as away as possible. Repatriation must be encouraged. Blacks can be replaced by South African whites, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Just compare Argentina (97% white, most developed country in South America) with nearby Bolivia (mostly Mestizo with ruling white elite).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see many differences between the US and Mexico.</p>

		<p>Sonia Sotomayor was born in this country, had twelve years of private education and still, by her own admission, needed affirmative action to get into college.  To me, that says it all.</p>
