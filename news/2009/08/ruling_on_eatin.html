<h1>Ruling on Eating Mermaids</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shaykh Muhammads al-Munajjid, Islam Q&A;, May 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><b>Is there any such thing as a mermaid?</b></p>
<p>Praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p>A mermaid is a creature that lives in water and looks like a human. As to whether it really exists or it is a mythical being, that is subject to further discussion.</p>
<p>It says in a footnote in al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/129): From the modern academic resources that are available to us, it may be understood that the mermaid, which is called Sirène in French, is a mythical creature that is described in fairy tales as having an upper body like a woman and a lower half like a fish.</p>
<p>See the French Larousse encyclopédique on the word Sirène.</p>
<p>The encyclopaedia goes on to say: The widespread notion in ancient times was that the wonders and animals of the sea were more and greater than the wonders of dry land, and that there was no kind of animal in the sea that did not have a counterpart on land. This was confirmed by Prof. Muhammad Fareed Wajdi in his encyclopaedia, quoting from modern academic sources. See: Daa&rsquo;irah Ma&rsquo;aarif al-Qarn al-&#8216;Ishreen: Bahr  &mdash;  Hayawiyan. End quote.</p>
<p>Al-Dumayri said in Hayaat al-Haywaan al-Kubra: Mermaid: it resembles a human but it has a tail. Al-Qazweeni said: Someone brought one of them in our time. End quote.</p>
<p>Many of the fuqaha&rsquo; mentioned mermaids and differed on the ruling concerning them. Some of them said that they are permissible (to eat) because of the general meaning of the evidence which says that whatever is in the sea is permissible. This is the view of the Shaafa&rsquo;is and Hanbalis, and is the view of most of the Maalikis and of Ibn Hazm and others. And some of them regarded it as haraam because it is not a kind of fish. This is the view of the Hanafis and of al-Layth ibn Sa&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Muhalla (6/50): As for that which lives in the water and cannot live anywhere else, it is all halaal no matter what state it is in, whether it is caught alive and then dies, or it dies in the water and then floats or does not float, whether it was killed by a sea creature or a land animal. It is all halaal to eat, whether it is the pig of the sea (i.e., a dolphin), a mermaid, or a dog of the sea (i.e., shark) and so on. It is halaal to eat, whether it was killed by an idol-worshipper, a Muslim, a kitaabi (Jew or Christian) or it was not killed by anyone.  The proof of that is the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  &#8220;And the two seas (kinds of water) are not alike: this is palatable, sweet and pleasant to drink, and that is salt and bitter. And from them both you eat fresh tender meat (fish)&#8221; [Faatir 35:12] and &#8220;Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water game and its use for food  &mdash;  for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel&#8221; [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:64]. Allaah spoke in general terms and did not exclude anything, &#8220;and your Lord is never forgetful&#8221; [Maryam 19:64]. End quote.</p>
<p>Al-Durayr  &mdash;  a Maaliki scholar  &mdash;  said in al-Sharh al-Sagheer (2/182): Sea animals in general are permissible, whether it is dead meat or a &#8216;dog&rsquo; (shark) or a &#8216;pig&rsquo; (dolphin), and they do not need to be slaughtered properly. End quote. </p>
<p>Al-Saawi said in his commentary on that: The words &#8220;or a &#8216;dog&rsquo; or a &#8216;pig&rsquo; also include a &#8216;human&rsquo;, referring thereby to mermaids. End quote.</p>
<p>Al-Nawawi  &mdash;  who was a Shaafa&rsquo;i scholar  &mdash;  said in al-Majmoo&rsquo; (9/33): As for that which does not appear in the well known form of a fish, the correct view according to our companions is that everything (from the sea) is permissible, because the correct view is that the name fish may be applied to all of it, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &#8220;Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water game and its use for food&#8221; [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:64]. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and others said: Its game is that which is hunted and its food is that which the sea throws out. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in the saheeh hadeeth: &#8220;Its water is a means of purification and its dead meat is halaal.&#8221; End quote.</p>
<p>Al-Mardaawi  &mdash;  who was a Hanafi scholar  &mdash;  said in al-Insaaf (10/364): All sea animals are permissible, except frogs, snakes and crocodiles. End quote.</p>
<p>Al-Kaasaani  &mdash;  who was a Hanafi scholar  &mdash;  said in Badaa&rsquo;i&rsquo; al-Sanaa&rsquo;i&rsquo; (5/35): As for that which lives in the sea, there is no animal in the sea that is haraam to eat except in the case of fish, it is permissible to eat it except that which floats. This is the view of our companions (may Allaah be pleased with them). End quote.</p>
<p>Ibn &#8216;Aabideen  &mdash;  who was a Hanafi scholar  &mdash;  said in Radd al-Muhtaar (6/307): Anything other than fish and the like, such as mermaids and dolphins, is impure and remains prohibited.</p>
<p>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, after stating that it is more likely that it is permissible to eat crocodiles and sea snakes: The correct view is that nothing is excluded from that, and that all the sea creatures which can only live in water are halaal, alive or dead, because of the general meaning of the verse  &mdash;  i.e., &#8220;Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water game and its use for food&#8221; [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:64]. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo; (6/327). Fajr edition.</p>
<p>And Allaah knows best.<br>

		<p>Apparently that verse was for those doing a pilgrimage. Those traveling to Mecca cannot hunt along the way because obviously it would deplete the local animal populations when huge numbers of people went.</p>
<p>&#8220;ALLOWED for you is the GAME OF THE SEA AND ITS FOOD, as a provision for you and for the travellers; and FORBIDDEN for you is the GAME OF THE LAND so long as you are in the pilgrim garb; and fear God unto whom you shall be gathered.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is much debate among the various Muslim sects as to whether fish must have scales or not. Some eat lobster, some forbid it. I guess the whole mermaid thing depends on whether they limit their seafood to that with scales, or anything out of the sea.</p>

		<p>I well remember a chic little bistro in Atlantis, just east of the Bermuda Triangle, recommended by all the Nereids as having the best mermaid fricassee this side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.</p>
<p>A bit pricey, at 12 clams, but truly, a dish to die for.</p>

		<p>What a pathetic theology! The worst thing is that we have to take them seriously because they&rsquo;re dangerous sociopathic freaks.<br>
No wonder that Islam is so attractive to Blacks. THey get to believe all this fantastic stuff, play dress up and abuse women with the approval of their so called clerical leadership. <br>
They have to pray so many times per day that it&rsquo;s no wonder that they are living in the THird World because they spend so much time trying to please a self centered, selfish, cruel and mysoginistic Deity that they never accomplish anything.  The only ones who prosper are their self- indulgent, despotic, perverted rulers who live off the oil money suppplied to them by the First World nations whom they hate but without whose help one hundred or so years ago, they never would have been able to harvest the petroleum from the ground.<br>

<p><i>A mermaid is a creature that lives in water and looks like a human. As to whether it really exists or it is a mythical being, that is subject to further discussion.</i></p>
<p><br>
Hey Muslims, we could have that &#8220;further discussion&#8221; right now   &mdash;   I promise it won&rsquo;t take long. Here goes: <i>No, mermaids don&rsquo;t really exist; yes they are mythical beings.</i></p>
<p>Anything else I can enlighten you people about while we&rsquo;re at it? Because I&rsquo;ve got some other newsflashes for the <i>ummah</i>: The sky is blue; water is wet; and gravity makes stuff fall <i>down</i>, not up. </p>
<p>Oh, and Jews and Infidels are <i>not</i> &#8220;the sons of pigs and monkeys,&#8221; I should probably mention that too. </p>

		<p>I see people laughing the fact that some Muslims may believe in Mermaids.</p>
<p>They must laugh even harder at us when they see us elect leader after leader that puts our own interest on the backburner while placing those of Muslim immigrants to the front of the line. They must also laugh when we jail our own people in our own countries because they do not have the proper &#8220;social opinions&#8221;.<br>
They must also laugh at us when we put programs like affirmative action in place which result in the displacement of OUR OWN sons.<br>
They must laugh at the Anglican church when it appoints people only a generation removed from the jungle to lead it.<br>
Yes my friends, say what you want about Islam, but arguably the most backward ideology (possibly in all of human development) in existence is the one that huge numbers of OUR OWN people adhere to.</p>

<p>The news on all fronts is grim, our prospects for success dim as things now stand, but being able to step back and have a laugh at the absurdity of it all is necessary and beneficial.</p>
<p>At least from my perspective&hellip;</p>
<p>Excuse me, I must be off. My local Titanic Sink-&-Save is having a special on Mermaid Helper.</p>

		<p>Yes, I was laughing at moslem foolishness until I read Robert&rsquo;s sobering post.  He&rsquo;s right.  Ridiculous as some Moslem beliefs are, ours are worse. At least they are not against themselves. They may be worried about eating mermaids, but they&rsquo;re not committing mass suicide like lemmings. Who are the REAL idiots in this picture?</p>
