<h1>Holder&rsquo;s Black Panther Stonewall</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Fund, Wall Street Journal, August 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama&rsquo;s Justice Department continues to stonewall inquiries about why it dropped a voter intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party.</p>
<p>The episode  &mdash;  which Bartle Bull, a former civil rights lawyer and publisher of the left-wing Village Voice, calls &#8220;the most blatant form of voter intimidation I&rsquo;ve ever seen&#8221;  &mdash;  began on Election Day 2008. Mr. Bull and others witnessed two Black Panthers in paramilitary garb at a polling place near downtown Philadelphia. {snip}</p>
<p>One of them, they say, brandished a nightstick at the entrance and pointed it at voters and both made racial threats. Mr. Bull says he heard one yell &#8220;You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the first week of January, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party and three of its members, saying they violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act by scaring voters with the weapon, uniforms and racial slurs. In March, Mr. Bull submitted an affidavit at Justice&rsquo;s request to support its lawsuit.</p>
<p>When none of the defendants filed any response to the complaint or appeared in federal district court in Philadelphia to answer the suit, it appeared almost certain Justice would have prevailed by default. Instead, the department in May suddenly allowed the party and two of the three defendants to walk away. Against the third defendant, Minister King Samir Shabazz, it sought only an injunction barring him from displaying a weapon within 100 feet of a Philadelphia polling place for the next three years  &mdash;  action that&rsquo;s already illegal under existing law.</p>
<p>There was outrage over the decision among Congressional Republicans, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and in the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division  &mdash;  especially after it was learned one of the defendants who walked was Jerry Jackson, a member of Philadelphia&rsquo;s 14th Ward Democratic Committee and a credentialed poll watcher for the Democratic Party last Election Day.</p>
<p>Then the Washington Times reported on July 30 that six career lawyers at Justice who had recommended continuing to pursue the case were overruled by Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli  &mdash;  a top administration political appointee. One of the career attorneys, Appellate Chief Diana Flynn, had urged in an internal memo that a judgment be pressed against the defendants to &#8220;prevent the paramilitary style intimidation of voters&#8221; in the future.</p>
<p>{snip} Black Panther Party Chairman Malik Zulu Shabazz, said on Fox News just after the election that his activities at the polling station were part of a nationwide effort. Mr. Shabazz added that the Black Panther activities in Philadelphia were justified due to &#8220;an emergency situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights voted on Aug. 7 to send a letter to Justice expanding its own investigation and demanding more complete answers. &#8220;We believe the Department&rsquo;s defense of its actions thus far undermines respect for rule of law,&#8221; its letter stated. It noted &#8220;the peculiar logic&#8221; of one Justice argument, that defendants&rsquo; failure to show up in court was a reason for dismissing the case: &#8220;Such an argument sends a perverse message to wrongdoers  &mdash;  that attempts at voter suppression will be tolerated so long as the persons who engage in them are careful not to appear in court to answer the government&rsquo;s complaint.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Obama needs to clear the air. As a former law professor who specialized in voting rights, he is aware of how important even-handed application of the law is to election integrity. In 2007, then-Sen. Obama introduced a bill to protect Americans from tactics that intimidate voters. It also increased the criminal penalty for voter intimidation to five years in prison from one year.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;President Obama&rsquo;s Justice Department continues to stonewall inquiries about why it dropped a voter intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed so hard when I read this, I almost soiled myself!</p>
<p>What do you expect of General Secretary BO and his merry pack of: Mau Maus, banditos, house honkies, and otherwise treasonous &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; retrograde hippies and media malcontents? Did you want a &ldquo;fair deal,&rdquo; when all that bunch ever even made pretenses of volleying was an erratically nebulous &ldquo;hope&rdquo; hoopla and a &ldquo;changed&rdquo; deal, printed on crimson tissues?</p>
<p>What better to blot your tear ducts and dripping nostrils with?</p>
<p>The problem is not: Comrade BO, his duplicitous white lickspittles, or his rabid nonwhite entitlement junkies. They are only the symptoms of a political void that has fashioned itself into a &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; process of unscrupulously propagated &ldquo;stability.&rdquo; Or put another way, we may very well have reached the ends of an outmoded multiculturalism, while still enjoying its unbearably torturous means.</p>
<p>That is the precise &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of Obama, our glorious General Secretary and &ldquo;savior;&rdquo; a post-racial construct, that is virulently genocidal toward the white race in the USA in particular, and on this planet as a whole!</p>
<p>Of course, there are solutions to this problem; shockingly similar in nature to the &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; policy of &ldquo;stonewalling&rdquo; by the current administration, they could easily reverse, bloodlessly and politically, the current anti-white wet-daydream. </p>
<p>1.) Apartheid must be introduced as a &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; political answer, to the leftists&rsquo; &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; electoral and incremental incursions. Indeed, over time, even ordinary whites who do not hold a realistic view of race, should have all voting &ldquo;rights&rdquo; stripped from them.</p>
<p>2.) A policy of omnipresent race realism, must be introduced legally to deconstruct the fashionably current multicultural &ldquo;dynamic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.) Both rapidly (such as with illegal &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; and their progeny) and gradually (such as with established &ldquo;American&rdquo; nonwhite minorities,) a policy of reasonably bloodless/politically enforced controlled elimination, should be applied with regard to population management that sees the USA returned to 90% white or greater by 2025.</p>
<p>Enough said!!!</p>

		<p>Jon Voigt just asserted that he believes Obama might cause civil war in this country.  Incidents like the above where armed blacks intimidated whites at a polling place, telling them they were there to make certain a black man gets elected, just add to the overall picture that is forming of Obama the racist.</p>
<p>Included in that overall picture of racism, is the disturbing news that he has appointed so many self-avowed communists, black nationalists, and black racists to his administration he is beginning to emerge to many of those who adored him as someone who just may not be in the best interests of this country.</p>
<p>Did anybody but me see the Glenn Beck show where Glenn said he thought Obama was a racist and had a psychiatrist on who said enough information has evolved to determine that he certainly has some issues with whites?</p>

Glenn Beck says Obama is racist on Fox and Friends</p>
<p>Carol Swain was right about one important thing in her article yesterday, and that was her opinion that, instead of bringing the races together, Obama has driven them apart. </p>
<p>Yes, Jon Voigt, I think you&rsquo;re right. We ARE going to have a civil war.  </p>

		<p> I remember reading somewhere some time back of a high ranking civil rights leader stating that civil rights legislation was for blacks only. It would appear she spoke the truth.<br>
 With this action, the administration is sending a clear message to all black organizations that they have nothing to fear for any actions they take against whites. Contrast that with Obama automatically siding with Professor Gates against the white police officer.<br>
 I&rsquo;ll leave it up to anyone that reads this to draw their own conclusion.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s without doubt better than the usual black AA student, but since he won&rsquo;t release anything he has written, his grades or anything else, the reason has to be that he&rsquo;s not very proud of his endeavors.</p>
<p>As white professionals go, however, he belongs somewhere around low mediocre or maybe less.  It&rsquo;s hard to tell, because he&rsquo;s been fixated so much on the subjects he works on now, better known as community organizing, it&rsquo;s difficult to evaluate his intelligence.</p>
<p>He HAS commited some really dumb things and has said things that make me wonder if he&rsquo;s not the usual blacks, like, &#8220;There&rsquo;s no use in restricting travel into the US because of the Swine Flu.  It won&rsquo;t do any good to shut the barn door; the horse is already out.&#8221; That&rsquo;s really dumb.  Common white logic would tell us it is never too late to restrict movement and take other precautions in the midst of a raging epidemic.  There will be heaths, but far fewer.  </p>
<p>And I won&rsquo;t go into other similar indications that reveal he displays the usual black inability to logic.  Suffice it to say, the Gates debacle was a real winner.  How about trying to sell his Healthcare bill by saying FedX and UPS does far better than the post office? </p>
<p>Before he&rsquo;s out of there, however, we will know a LOT more about him.  Maybe somebody will pay somebody and we might get to see his records revealing a not so bright student. </p>

		<p>Since JFK the federal government has been the literal enemy of decent White citizens. Every administration has been more hostile than the one before with the partial exception of Reagan (Don&rsquo;t forget that Reagan signed a huge illegal alien amnesty and allowed the left-wing neocons to dominate him.)</p>
<p>With Obama we have reached the very bottom. He is a deeply stupid, corrupt, affirmative-action parasite who has nothing but contempt for Whites. Obama is a left-wing fascist who has already defined his domestic opponents as potential terrorists. Like Lenin and Stalin before him he elevates criminals like the Black Panthers, La Raza and ACORN to positions of respect and authority.</p>
<p>We are in the hands of an angry, overgrown adolescent who believes his every act of corruption and illegal abuse of power is an act of moral superiority. Obama is a traitor and the logical conclusion of the last 50 years of left-wing policies. When he lies, when he fails, when he destroys this country utterly he will blame us. He doesn&rsquo;t even have the sense to hide his malignant, hostile intentions.</p>

<p>Obama is the perfect front man for the hostile elites.  Any criticism of him or what his handlers feed into his teleprompter elicits instant loud screams of &#8216;racism&rsquo; throughout the government-controlled media.  He, unlike anyone else, has been given a pass.</p>
<p>Whoever believed that obama was &#8216;brilliant&rsquo;?  He is a creation of the government-controlled media and the hostile elites behind it, nothing more.</p>
