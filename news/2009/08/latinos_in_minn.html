<h1><a href="http://www.twincities.com/minnesota/ci_13001718?nclick_check=1">Latinos in Minnesota, Wisconsin Urged to Take Part in 2010 Census</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sophia Tareen, AP, Aug. 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A legal advocacy group launched an education and awareness campaign Wednesday encouraging Latinos in 11 Midwest states, including Minnesota and Wisconsin, to participate in the 2010 U.S. census. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the most important civil rights issues,&#8221; said Elisa Alfonso, a director of the group&rsquo;s Midwest office in Chicago. &#8220;This is what gives you access to voting and funding.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The census, mandated by the U.S. Constitution every 10 years, asks questions about race, age, gender and the number of people living in each household. It is used to decide how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are distributed and how congressional districts are drawn. </p>
<p>Still, challenges exist in reaching out to Latinos, Alfonso said. Some immigrants are wary of providing detailed personal information to the government because they fear doing so could lead to inquiries on immigration status for themselves or family members. </p>
<p>The census does not ask about immigration status or citizenship. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its campaign, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund is stressing the confidentiality of the data and encouraging people to mail back completed forms early. Their slogan for the effort is &#8220;Hagase Contar,&#8221; or &#8220;Make Yourself Count.&#8221; </p>
<p>A bright yellow flier from the group reads, &#8220;by law, the Census Bureau cannot share your answers with anyone, including federal, state and local agencies. This includes immigration agencies.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Census officials insist they&rsquo;re making efforts. For the first time with the 2010 census, the agency is sending out Spanish-language questionnaires to about 13 million households.<br>

		<p>An illegal alien can NEVER be an American, and Minnesota was NEVER part of &#8216;Aztlan&rsquo;, no matter how much they lie about it.</p>
<p>I like what the Scottish Nationalists so succinctly put: &#8220;An African can no more be a Scot by donning a kilt, than a Scotsman can become an African by donning a grass skirt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The era of &#8216;proposition nation&rsquo; is over. With Obama&rsquo;s clearly racist remarks in the Gatesgate case,  it is clear that even a &#8216;post-racial&rsquo; president is still, in essance, a bigot. Oh, wait- wasn&rsquo;t twenty years under Jeremiah &#8216;Wrong&rsquo; a clue?</p>
<p>James Edwards is right- it&rsquo;s time for the rise of &#8216;ethnopolitics.&rsquo;<br>
How do I become a census taker, so I can ask for a green card at the same time I am counting the &#8216;anchor babies&rsquo; mamacita is procreating in her Section 8 housing, all of it off my tax dollars?</p>
<p>(And I left Californication for this very reason, twenty years ago!)</p>

		<p>I am definitely for illegal mexicans identifying themselves in the census whether or not their illegal status is discussed.</p>
<p>We need to know exactly how many mexicans we&rsquo;re going to have to deport in the long run, after all.  Besides, knowledge is power.</p>

		<p>When the acorn (oops, I mean &#8220;census&#8221; worker) comes to the door, ask for identification.  You will need it for the police report that you will file after your house is broken into.  Some of the questions such as &#8220;what time do you leave for work?&#8221; and &#8220;how many hours do you work per day?&#8221; can (and will) be used by acorn census workers to &#8220;case&#8221; your residence and will be seen as an opportunity to take whatever they want to fulfill their sense of &#8220;social justice&#8221;.  I plan on asking for ID, writing everything down, and then telling them to leave (without answering any questions) since I cannot verify their identity.<br>
Another way to &#8220;make things right&#8221; is to &#8220;skew&#8221; the census (if you choose to &#8220;cooperate&#8221; and answer questions).  The only question that is legally required to be answered is the one  concerning &#8220;how many people live at this residence?&#8221;  Be creative.  You should have at least SIX people living with you.<br>
acorn skewed the election with graveyard voters and multiple fraudulent voter registrations.  Let&rsquo;s &#8220;adjust&#8221; the census.Another way to &#8220;make things right&#8221; is to &#8220;skew&#8221; the census (if you choose to &#8220;cooperate&#8221; and answer questions).

		<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering how many will declare themselves white on the census and get rolled into the white demographic for census and statistical purposes.</p>
<p>Everytime I see situations like Southgate, CA a city that is officially over 40% white even though non-latino whites there only comprise 0.78% of the city&rsquo;s population it makes me wonder what the true demographics in this country really are. It seems they are so misconstrued, and subsequently misrepresented/misreported, as to constitute grevious error. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we just get to the facts?</p>

<p>Letting them into the country in the first place opened ourselves up to their constant attempts to try to take over.</p>
<p>They want to take the census, just as Acorn does, to distort the figures to reflect false figures showing there are more of their tribal kin here than what there actually is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to go on record saying I hope the bottom falls out of this economy so that we can break up into our own white territory, without the disgusting white PC fools and non-whites.  Let them all live together, then pick up the pieces after they self-destruct.  Any leftist whites afterwards who wants to come back, because they can&rsquo;t stand the multicultural utopia they worked so hard for, can be greeted with a fist.</p>

		<p>There will be at least 6 white people living in my home during the census. I suggest all whites suddenly &#8216;take in&rsquo; a large number of family around that time.</p>
