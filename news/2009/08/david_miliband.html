<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1206833/David-Miliband-There-circumstances-terrorism-justifiable.html">David Miliband: There Are Circumstances in Which Terrorism Can Be Justifiable</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Glen Owen, Daily Mail (London), August 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Foreign Secretary David Miliband was accused last night of condoning terrorism after declaring that there were circumstances in which it was &#8216;justifiable&rsquo;.</p>
<p>His remarks  &mdash;  made in support of the ANC&rsquo;s armed struggle against apartheid in South Africa  &mdash;  were swiftly condemned by the Conservatives, who accused him of giving succour to the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The military wing of the ANC carried out a number of terrorist attacks during its campaign, including the Church Street bombing in Pretoria in 1983 in which 19 people were killed and more than 200 wounded. Many of the victims were civilians.</p>
<p>Mr Miliband was speaking on BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Great Lives programme, in which he chose to pay tribute to the South African anti-apartheid activist Joe Slovo  &mdash;  a friend of Mr Miliband&rsquo;s father, the academic Ralph Miliband.</p>
<p>Mr Slovo, who shared Miliband senior&rsquo;s belief in Marxist ideology, was one of the leaders of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the armed military wing of the ANC.</p>
<p>Asked by presenter Matthew Parris whether there were any circumstances in which terrorism was justified, Mr Miliband said: &#8216;Yes, there are circumstances in which it is justifiable, and yes, there are circumstances in which it is effective.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;The importance for me is that the South African example proved something remarkable: the apartheid regime looked like a regime that would last forever, and it was blown down.</p>
<p>It is hard to argue that, on its own, a political struggle would have delivered. The striking at the heart of a regime&rsquo;s claim on a monopoly of power, which the ANC&rsquo;s armed wing represented, was very significant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last night, Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague said the remarks were ill-judged. He said: &#8216;Ministers must be very careful before advancing any argument that seems to legitimise terrorism in some circumstances.</p>
<p>When so much of the efforts of our security services, and the sacrifices of our troops in Afghanistan, are devoted to defeating terrorists, this is hardly the time to argue that terrorism is sometimes acceptable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Miliband, who appeared on the programme with Mr Slovo&rsquo;s daughter Gillian, described fondly how, as an 18-year-old, he opened the door to Mr Slovo, who had turned up unannounced at the Miliband family home to discuss politics with his parents.</p>
<p>Mr Slovo, who died in 1995, aged 69, once wrote about his experience of bomb-making, describing how he and his fellow militants would experiment with different explosive materials and timer technology.</p>
<p>Umkhonto we Sizwe was formed in alliance with the South African Communist Party (SACP), which Mr Slovo led for six years from 1984. The SACP backed the Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, and was regarded as the most Stalinist branch of the communist party outside the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Church Street attack involved a car bomb set off outside the Nedbank Square building at 4.30pm on a Friday. The target was the South African Air Force headquarters, but as the bomb was set to go off at the height of rush hour, those killed and wounded included civilians.</p>
<p>Other ANC-linked atrocities included the 1986 car-bombing of Magoo&rsquo;s Bar in Durban, in which three people were killed.</p>
<p>At one point in the programme, Gillian Slovo suggested that if her father was to be termed a &#8216;terrorist&rsquo;, then so should &#8216;the Bush administration for going into Iraq&rsquo; because it was using &#8216;terror to pursue political ends&rsquo;. Mr Miliband did not contest her assertion  &mdash;  despite the Blair Government&rsquo;s role in the invasion.<br>

		<p>By his logic muslim terrorism against the British in the future UK, will be justifiable.</p>
<p>Terrorism against white people anywhere, anytime is justifiable, no wonder UK is where it is now.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised that a muslim UK will ally with a muslim France to attack white Eastern Europe and Russia.<br>

		<p>Thank you, Mr. Milibrand.  May your words be prophetic and come back to haunt you.</p>
<p>As for Gillian Slovo, her terrorist-supporting mother died opening an assassin&rsquo;s letter bomb, which is a prime example of poetic justice.</p>

		<p>Joe Slovo was a national of some Eastern European Soviet client state, but he worked for the Soviet secret police, the KGB. He spent his lifetime turning all of southern Africa, but most especially prosperous Rhodesia and South Africa, into a place so unstable that, in the presence of British and American governments like those that rule those nations today, the Soviet Union could waltz in and take charge when African matters turned chaotic, even by African standards. But there was no Soviet Union when South Africa fell, and there has been no western leader with guts enough to speak the truth and send in the Marines.</p>
<p>As for the terrorism, Joe Slovo was a terrorist, and the Brit who apologizes for him seems to be one of those who has no strength of his own, a man who makes his living by running his mouth, and therefore he revels in the -usually sinister - strength of others, so long as they can cause him to feel that adolescent rebellion is heroic. It is people like him that lead me to conclude that there is no hope.</p>

		<p>The fact is that the indigenous population of Britain (which genetic evidence tells us has a continuity of at least 8000 years in Britain), will be racially replaced and displaced to the point of minority status some time this century.<br>
 This is purely a result of political policies pursued by people of the likes of David Milliband.He could stop it tomorrow if he wished, but he doesn&rsquo;t he WANTS it to happen.<br>
 The only democratic mass movement aiming to fight this existential threat to the British people (by far the gravest threat they have ever faced in 8000 years) is the BNP.<br>
The policy of the British Govenment is to destroy the BNP by various judicial and extra judicial means.<br>
 Some might argue that under these circumstances, as all democratic means are denied by the government, that &#8216;extra-parliamentary activity&rsquo; is the only means left to British nationalists.<br>
 - I wonder what Mr. Millibands reply to that is?</p>

		<p>As someone who lived throughout the terror of the ANC and other terrorist groups that used Apartheid to grab power with the help of the Soviet and other communist blocks including Cuba, (a country whose army was slaughtered by a lesser SA white army in Angola to the extent that the Cuban general in charge, Roca, was soon court martialled and shot for failure on his return to Cuba, I can tell much more than the propganda that was broadcast to the world at that time.  The swamping of the whites by the black populations (11 different languages) and evidence of the ruined countries in Africa after they had been given their freedom, so Apartheid was intended so that each tribe would have its own homeland (Most bigger than the biggest US States), to live and to vote for their own leaders and develope at their own rates and the whites would act as a catalyst ensuring that none would descend to the savage level again as they have elsewhere in Africa.  I must keep stressing this for the racist liberals keep ignoring the facts.   Liberals who have never lived in that environment always think that all blacks are intelligent human beings who have the same values as we do, but history has proven this totally wrong and still it is except for far too few of them.   But it was not to be for the West thought that they knew beter and destroyed the plans that would have lessened the time taken to develope the black peoples to the best they can be.  Now it will tak 100 years or never.  </p>
<p>Forget about all the positive propaganda news pumped out by the African leaders now, read the facts.  You are 12 times more likely to be unlawfully killed in South Africa than in and look through te gloss.  Read te cards in hotel rooms advising you to not go for a walk in te cities on yoiur own.  Reception will supply a guard to go with you, and much more.</p>
<p>Under Apartheid, the black South Africanow they have it.  Over 3.000 white farmers brutally murdered in SA in recent years (3) and so on.  Blacks being killed in greater numbers by savage criminals than in the Apartheid days, so when you read of Joe Slovo, te communist &#8220;hero&#8221; he was just another murdering terrorist.</p>
<p>We must not allow the same to happen in the West. Argue at every opportunity against te liberals who 99% of them have never even lived in these countries but just have an impossible dream in their heads and they hate anyone who does not agree 100% with them.  They do not want to listen to reason based on facts and experiences, so stantd and up an be counted against these fools.<br>
I am a thorn in the side of some of the few I have met here i Spain (all British expats for the average Spanish person agrees with me).  IF THE FEW CALL ME A RACIST, I TELL THEM THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PRONOUNCE THE WORD SPELT &#8220;REALIST&#8221;.</p>
<p>The latest in the British Press is, as I forecast six months ago even on thsi site, the Africns are demanding $67 billion each year because the continent is being damaged by the West causing global warming, causing droughts and famines, something they had always suffered from until the Europeans settled and farmed properly.  Now the white are still being ejected from the continent, but they must still pay.  Only someone who has lived there can believe these illogical thoughts. It is now up to the voters in the West to stop the aid, force them to look after themselves as the white Africans have already proven can be easily done.<br>

		<p>  The Labour party has got to go. David Miliband is a total P.O.S. How could anybody look at South Africa, and say it was worth being a terrorist. That country has been destroyed. Is that what Miliband wants for the U.K.? Liberalism is not only a mental disease, it is pure evil. I would wager that he would change his mind if it were his family being butchered by these animals.</p>

When his colored marxist friends are cutting his throat because they have no more use for him, even then he will not realize he was wrong, but that the Color People are making a mistake. The elite are incapable of self examination, must come from spending every moment stupidly judging your own culture and people.     </p>

		<p>Miliband is a senior member of our present corrupt pro-communist government who are hell-bent on destroying England and Englishness. Encouraging totally unrestricted, uncontrolled immigration of unskilled illiterate people from eastern europe, africa, pakistan and bangladesh at a time when unemployment levels of our indigenous population have reached unmanageable levels is absolutely unforgivable. We have no more jobs, housing, schools or medical provision available to cater for these incomers who, by their very nature, demand far more of these essential services as many are sick, none have any assets and very few speak or understand even basic English. The next general election will see the back of nu-labour but the entire government has already feathered it&rsquo;s nest, provided itself with massive pensions and consultancy jobs. They care nothing for England and are all traitors to our country, being pro-muslim to the core.   </p>

<p>Good for you, Yorkshireman!  I hope there are enough like you still in England.  It does seem that the situation is soon to come to a test.  I wonder just how far this will go before there is a general strike?</p>
<p>Once it happens in England, it may start in other British Commonwealth nations and even in the U.S.  The notion of POLITICAL GENOCIDE ought to be a prominent complaint, IMHO.  And it is a valid one.</p>

		<p>Milliband and all the rest of them are products of the University system of the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s.  They were weaned on a diet of Marxism Today, Rock Against Racism, the Socialist Workers Party, The AntiNazi League, the &#8220;Struggle Against Apartheid&#8221;.  They are all Marxists in suits, with good PR.  These idiots infest all the higher levels of local government, the Police, the Civil Service.  They have made their minds up as to how the world will be, and NOTHING will stop them.  Not facts, not statistics, not common sense, not logic.  They may have twigged that what they want is impossible, but they have gone too far to back down now.  They will not stop until they achieve their impossible goal (ie, they will not stop. Ever), or they are stopped by someone else. I fear that the people of Formerly Great Britain, simply, do not give a monkey&rsquo;s, and wont give a monkey&rsquo;s, until it is too late for them to do anything.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous wrote at 6:42 PM on August 25&hellip;.&#8221;This is a bit bizarre, in that Nelson Mandela is a convicted terrorist, is he not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes. Mandela was convicted in 1964, for being the head of a terrorist organization called Umkonto, the armed wing of the ANC.</p>
<p>But are you aware that the Republican Congress, headed by Newt Gingrich, awarded Mandela the US Congressional Gold Medal in 1998? Are you also aware that George W. Bush awarded Mandela with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2003, a few months after Mandela had viciously denounced Bush for the Iraq War. </p>
<p>Did you also know that economic sanctions against South Africa in 1986, were pushed by Republicans such as Richard Lugar, Newt Gingrich, and Jack Kemp, who worked closely with Democrats?</p>
<p>Yet, the leftist human rights organization, Amnesty International, refused to recognize Mandela as a political prisoner in the 1970s and 1980s, because they felt that Mandela&rsquo;s conviction for terrorism in 1964 was valid and legitimate.    <br>

<p>Rebelcelt, what do you mean &#8220;his own forbears&#8221;?    You are missing something here.  aND What do you mean about judging   <b>his &#8220;own culture and people&#8221;? </b>Do you think he cares about them?  The naivety often found on this site amazes me.</p>
<p>Yorkshireman did much better, saying  that:  <i>&#8220;Miliband is a senior member of our present corrupt pro-communist government who are hell-bent on destroying England and Englishness. &hellip;They care nothing for England and are all traitors, being pro-muslim to the core.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>He got that right, up until almost the end where he said they are pro-Muslim.  I would have said, rather, that they are pro-OTHER.  That hits the mark more precisely. Miliband et al are not so interested in helping the Muslims as in harming the English.  To those like Milliband, the question of Muslims, Hindus, or whatever is at bottom irrelevant   &mdash;   just so long as the invaders/displacers  are  anti-English, anti-Christian, anti-European. Anything that is &#8216;other&rsquo; will do.</p>
<p>Whiteplight says, &#8220;The notion of POLITICAL GENOCIDE ought to be a prominent complaint and is a valid one.&#8221;  That is an excellent idea!  And a devastatingly good term to use, hard for them to deny.  It should highlighted by us and used often.</p>
<p>Jason says:  &#8220;The present Labour govt in England is on the whole made up of former members of the Communist Party &hellip; 20 years ago this bunch were called the loony left for their silly ideas;  sadly they were elected to high office.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing here.  Just look who&rsquo;s running the White House now   &mdash;  - the Bernadine Dorn/Bill Ayres  club.</p>
<p>Also excellent comments from  RM Parker about Republicans and Mandela.  And I have to sympathize with  EastR who wrote, &#8220;You are not a white country for many years. When the time comes, please don&rsquo;t come to Eastern Europe.&#8221;   Sad to say, he is absolutely right!</p>

		<p>Culturally alienated individuals (such as Miliband and Slovo) are fundamentally sick.  They are motivated by a gnawing hatred of those around them, a desire to get back at those they feel have rejected them and whom they reject in turn and wish to punish. They are more interested in harming whites than they are in helping non-whites.  Whatever group they are ostensibly championing   &mdash;  whether it is Patagonians, Hottentots, Eskimos, or Fiji Islanders   &mdash;   is essentially irrelevant. </p>
<p>For one topical example, just look at Ted Kennedy (indeed, the whole Kennday clan!) -  he spent his entire life working at it. For this subversion of white interests, he is adulated by the media!  Unfortunately, we have too many people like this   &mdash;   held up before us as saints, when actually they hate us and are anything but.</p>

<p>Not unusual.  Like so many others of those &#8220;culturally alienated individuals&#8221;  who hate the greater society around them, he spent his life re-paying with contempt the very society that gave him great wealth, power, comfort and privilege.   As a gesture of supreme ingratitude, he/they gave it contempt and subversion in return.   Nice!</p>
