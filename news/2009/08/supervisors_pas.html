<h1><a href="http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&amp;article_id=11239">Supervisors Pass Resolution Urging FCC Investigate Media Hate Speech</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dennis McMillan, San Francisco Bay Times, August 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution, 11-0, on Aug. 11 sponsored by Supervisor David Campos and co-sponsored by Supervisors John Avalos, David Chiu, Chris Daly, Bevan Dufty, Eric Mar, Sophie Maxwell and Ross Mirkarimi, &#8220;urging the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to conduct a comprehensive investigation on hate speech in the media, allowing public participation via public hearings, and asking the NTIA to update its 1993 report on &#8216;The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An investigation on hate speech in the media has the potential of serving the highest interest of free speech, the First Amendment, and the security of individuals and groups in their persons and in their living environments,&#8221; said Aurora Grajeda of National Hispanic Media Coalition. &#8220;The Hispanic/Latino Anti-Defamation Coalition SF applauds the San Francisco Board of Supervisors for standing up to hate media,&#8221; she said. Grajeda added, &#8220;Tolerance is the presumption of superiority; acceptance is a manifestation of love.&#8221;</p>
<p>A recent study from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has shown a correlation between hate radio and other media and hate crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is hopefully the first of many [such resolutions] throughout the country,&#8221; said Inez Gonzalez, vice president of NHMC. &#8220;We have seen the anger and hatred that the proliferation of misinformation about health care reform has caused in recent weeks.&#8221; She continued, &#8220;As President Obama sets out to reform immigration in 2010, let us build media literacy and awareness before Latinos and other immigrants are once again at the forefront of media attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Supervisors responded to grassroots activists in the Bay Area who have organized to call attention to the alarming increase of patently false and hateful language in media. For the last three years, the Hispanic/Latino Anti-Defamation Coalition SF has organized annual protests held at Clear Channel Communications. Clear Channel was selected as the protest site due to the Corporation&rsquo;s record of promoting some of the vilest purveyors of hate and intolerance, including Michael Savage and Glenn Beck, who denigrate communities, groups, and individuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate Speech in media is not only targeted to the Latino community but also to other communities of color, women, the disabled, and gay/ lesbian/ bisexual, and transgender people,&#8221; said Gonzalez. &#8220;It is a cancer in our society, and it needs to be addressed.&#8221; She said government needs to recognize, not ignore, the plight of the people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is the first elected body to take a stand against hate speech in media. &#8220;We are hopeful that more courageous elected leaders will also take a stand,&#8221; said Gonzalez.<br>

		<p>Will the &#8220;outpatient clinic&#8221; as us old San Franciscans call the Board of Supervisors ask the FCC to investigate black talk radio and some of its vicious hateful kill whitey diatribes?</p>
<p>Certainly not, black hate speech is protected under the first amendment, while anything Whites say that is not cleared by the ADL $PLC censorship board is deemed hate speech.</p>
<p>Lenin and Stalin executed persons found guilty of being &#8220;enemies of the people.&#8221;  Now under the control of the ADL #PLC NOW ACLU<br>
LaRaza NAACP crowd, whites can now be found guilty of thought crime.</p>
<p>I assume the hispanic ADL is funded by the Jewish ADL to prevent any discussion of the consequences of unchecked hispanic immigration and its effects.</p>

		<p>Most of the hate speech that there is in the media is directed against whites.There are always fictional depictions of Whitey doing bad things to Blackey, and this is by far  the biggest factor fueling black on white hate crimes, which are usually done by young blacks. By the time they reach middle age, they are able to figure out that what they have seen on television all those years is pure fantasy.</p>

		<p>Now we can add the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to the Enemies of Free Speech Hall of Fame, (as if their stance is any surprise). And an honorary mention to NHMC.</p>
<p>Obviously they call the truth hate speech, because they hate (and can&rsquo;t handle) the truth. </p>

		<p>One more day in San Fran&hellip;obviously an attempt to shut down Savage.</p>
<p><i>Grajeda added, &ldquo;Tolerance is the presumption of superiority; acceptance is a manifestation of love.&rdquo;</i>  </p>
<p>This bizarre statement would almost be funny in a self parodying sort of way, if these racial totalitarians were not out to destroy any semblance of free political speech among whites.</p>

	David Irving has done exhaustive work on the subject of (World War-II) and those who seek to discredit the research done by him and other historians are the same people who have no qualms of throwing you, or yours in prison for saying, thinking, or even questioning their version of history. David Irving was imprisoned for committed a thought crime. You might be next.<br>

		<p>Any comment about the illegality of millions of Latinos&rsquo; residence in the US and the cost imposed on the USA(true) is denigrated as hate speech. </p>
<p>This is nothing but blackmail and extortion against those speakers in the media who oppose illegal immigration. How being against law breaking is itself lawbreaking is nothing but absurd. Clear Channel is going nowhere. </p>
<p>We need a govt with guts to see that illegal immigrants go somewhere.</p>

<p>What does criticism of the healthcare plan have to do with hate<br>
speech? I never thought that I would see the media get bashed for being too right-wing.  I guess that Obama&rsquo;s disatisfaction with a media that dares to criticize is being shared by those who want to ride on the gravy train that he keeps trying to bring into the station! All aboard!</p>

<p>The left is shameless.  Somehow a clear cut and open attack on free speech is supposed to serve the &#8220;highest interest of free speech and the First Amendment&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that MEChA and La Raza aren&rsquo;t going to appear on their list of haters.</p>
<p>The most pervasive hate in the media comes from the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; sources, which invariably depicts white men as fools or criminals, who are opposed and defeated by strong white women and their black male lovers.</p>

<p>Well that is at the root of their concern.  Whites finally showed some opposition to a bill that they know they will have to pay for.   So vigorously voicing opposition is now considered hate speech.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s true that there is a lot of hate speech in the media - almost all of it directed toward whites.  The only &#8220;hate speech&#8221; directed against their cherished &#8220;people of color&#8221; are those hate facts that they are unsuccessful in suppressing.</p>

		<p>Once again, you can have multiculturalism and multi-racialism or you can have freedom,  you can&rsquo;t have both.   Empires require an imperial government. </p>
<p>While I was flipping the channels a while back I saw Dianne Feinstein moaning during the latest &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; debate about how we need such laws because poor immigrants are being assaulted.  She never mentioned the far more numerous victims of these immigrants or the criminality of these immigrant groups in general,  and of course no Conservative or Republican stood up to correct the record.   That&rsquo;s what passes for debate in what passes for a democracy.</p>
<p>What is it that these Hispanics want?  They want open borders forever in order to boost their numbers and power at our social and political expense.  Whites who ask for even the most reasonable  immigration controls are routinely called racists but these people never are.  The whole &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; campaign is a moral fraud,  and participating in that fraud and history&rsquo;s greatest crime - the destruction of Western Civilization - is the reason that Conservatism is a failure.  </p>

		<p>Remarkable that this &#8220;Hate Speech&#8221; only impacts non-Whites, homosexuals and such&hellip;while heterosexual, traditional Whites are NEVER, EVER the target of any hateful dialouge on any kind from any quarter.

		<p>When the National Hispanic Media Coalition were asked for an example of &#8220;hate speech&#8221; emanating from conservative talk radio hosts they cited the criticism of Obama&rsquo;s gov&rsquo;t-run health care plan. </p>
<p>Since most people hate tax increases and socialism that makes anyone who critiques Obamacare guilty of &#8220;hate speech&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It boggles the mind as to how apathetic, uncaring, and in general, just plain LOW, the supervisors of Frisco and the idiot Mayor can go. They are worried about hate speech issues, but not about illegal alien gang members running around killing innocent citizens like the three Bologna family members. Vile, useless to the citizenry and cowardly to boot is what these supervisors are by any standards. It doesn&rsquo;t say much for the citizens that keep putting them in power over them either.</p>

<p><br>
These are NOT courageous leaders taking a stand, they are wimps, conforming to what the rest of the &#8220;politically correct&#8221; crowd wants them to do.  If one of them was truly courageous, he or she would stand up and say that whatever their personal feelings about what Glenn Beck or Michael Savage says, they have the RIGHT to say it.  A guaranteed right to say it, at least according to the CONSTITUTION before these stupid people started taking their big bottle of white-out to it!!<br>

<p>Pretty Orwellian, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>As far as I know, Savage isn&rsquo;t syndicated by Clear Channel.  </p>
<p>Clear Channel is a supporter of La Raza (listed on www.nclr.org).  You can see what that has got them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never heard Glenn Beck &#8220;denigrate communities, groups, and individuals&#8221;, except the traitors in the White House and Congress, past and present, including some of those good old &#8220;progressives&#8221;.</p>
<p>Funny how we are supposed to not just &#8220;tolerate&#8221;, but &#8220;love&#8221; these tens of millions of criminal invaders, just like they were our long-term, dependable neighbors and friends.  Has anyone asked THEM how they are practising &#8220;love&#8221; by invading our country and taking (stealing) our benefits and jobs, meant for citizens and legal immigrants only?</p>

		<p>Our constitution is enough.. we don&rsquo;t need special laws concerning the governing of thoughts/speech. There are laws in place for slander (bearing false witness), this should be enough to protect individuals from untrue accusations. {Anger unvented becomes hatred} America was not designed for the perpetual victimhood class and in my mind should not become such. Castrating freedom of thought and speech in the media is not a healthy developement! If people will be allowed to love they must be allowed to hate as these two are opposite sides of the same coin. This is the land of the free and the home of the brave! It should not be highjacked by pity ethics!</p>
