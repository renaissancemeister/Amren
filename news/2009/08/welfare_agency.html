			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer 8. Lee, New York Times, August 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An advocacy group sued New York City&rsquo;s welfare agency Tuesday morning, seeking to force it to comply with laws and policies that require translation and interpretation services for its clients.</p>
<p>A 2003 city law, the Equal Access to Human Services Act [pdf], passed after initial resistance from the Bloomberg administration,, gave city agencies five years to phase in comprehensive translation services, supplied by phone or in person. In addition, it required that city forms had to be made available in six main languages: Arabic, Chinese, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian and Spanish. The deadline was February 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The advocacy group, Legal Services NYC, filed the lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on behalf of six clients whose primary language is other than English. Because of language barriers, the suit contends, they either lost benefits, were delayed in getting benefits, or were unable to appeal benefits determinations effectively.</p>

		<p>They need to subtract the cost of the services from the payouts to the people who receive them. It should be on welfare recipients to cover the cost if they come over here and make little or no effort to learn the language of the country.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let this slight uptick in the stock market fool you.  It&rsquo;s not the beginning of a recovery it&rsquo;s a slight remission.  The corporations are showing a slight profit due to cutting their staff.  Soon it will take another nose dive.</p>
<p>When it does, New York is going to be cutting a lot of welfare payments.  They&rsquo;re almost broke right now.</p>
<p>This next wave of plummets is going to send even more of the third world opportunist who live filing lawsuits fleeing for greener pastures.<br>

		<p>I agree with legal services.  They must be taught how to properly access their TANF and SNAP benefits when they go shopping or while at an ATM.  Remember, these cash and fs benefits are now issued via an EFT card.</p>
<p>Also, if you do not provide all services, applications, brochures, advertisements in the primary languages how can the immigrants make sure the are getting every public benefits due them?</p>

		<p>To anonymous #2.  No, you cannot sue the government.  You can only sue taxpayers.  However, those taxpayers do not get to defend themselves.</p>

		<p>The United States of America is an english speaking nation! Learn it or leave it. That&rsquo;s it. Especially when asking for handouts from the taxpayer pot that you obviously have never contributed to. <br>
And to Topper, I believe you are right, my friend. The tide is turning. I must admit something to my (white) brothers and sisters who are avid AMREN readers, I was literally sick to my stomach the night that obama won the election, but now I think that he is doing more to wake up the general public to ideas we have been saying for years, than most of the leaders of our movement. This is an exciting time and although we face a well entrenched enemy, I know that our smarts and morals will eventually win out against these beasts. How ironic that obama and his cronies did exactly what they said in my case, they have given me &#8220;Hope&#8221; for &#8220;Change&#8221;! I bet it wasn&rsquo;t what the good ole Kenyan-in-chief had in mind.</p>

		<p>Something smells. Except for kids born in the US, usually people who don&rsquo;t speak English aren&rsquo;t citizens. Is NY paying welfare to thousands of illegals? Is this contrary to NY law? Maybe someone can read the law to NY&rsquo;s rather slow black and blind Governor Patterson?</p>

		<p>This kind of lawsuit happens all the time.</p>
<p>Many state &amp; federal welfare programs mandate   &mdash;   in their own regulations   &mdash;   that the agency survey the community it serves to determine what languages are used, and develop a written plan for how to accomodate people who speak these languages.  (It is considered unethical to have a family member or friend translate, since you may need to discuss sensitive matters, and/or the translator may have a personal interest in the outcome.)</p>
<p>English as Official Language laws may sound merely &#8220;symbolic&#8221; at first, but the more you know about the financial costs and harm to national unity caused by catering to foreigners who refuse to learn our language, the more you come to appreciate their importance.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Main 6 languages?&#8221; how is &#8220;main&#8221; defined? Any group who joined the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Immigration to the U.S has a rule that says &#8220;all immigrants to the U.S must be proficient in the ENGLISH language&#8221;</p>
<p>The only exception to this rule is in the case of refugees from certain designated nations - in which case the charity which brought them over is responsible for translation services.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite certain that none of the languages listed is relevant to any of these refugees.</p>
<p>And Haitian Creole is a &#8220;main language?&#8221; - To who? Creole Haitians???. All 78 of them? </p>
<p>Is the language of Liberal Gibberish on the list? If not it should be.</p>

		<p>The LDS church can teach a mono lingual 19 year old missionary Utah farm boy during a three month class any foreign language they desire to spread their gospel worldwide. </p>
<p>Put the LDS church should in charge to teach foreigners (at their expense) the English language, as the only administrative language of the USA.<br>
No English? no benefits, no residency,no papers, no nothing! <br>
The multi lingual idiocy on cost of the tax payer has to stop!</p>
