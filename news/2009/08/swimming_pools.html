<h1>Swimming Pool&rsquo;s Dress Code for Non-Muslims Is Scrapped</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Neil Millard, This Is London, August 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A London council has backtracked on rules forcing swimmers to cover up at a public pool to avoid offending Muslims.</p>
<p>Croydon council has removed the guidelines from its website after being criticised for barring non-Muslims if they refused to comply with the dress code.</p>
<p>They were put in place for weekend swimming sessions for Muslims at Thornton Heath Leisure Centre despite a general ban on wearing T-shirts in the pool.</p>
<p>The council&rsquo;s online statement read: &#8220;During special Muslim sessions, male costumes must cover the body from the navel to the knee and females must be covered from the neck to the ankles and wrists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croydon Mosque and Islamic Centre praised the rules but said it would never have asked for them.</p>
<p>Trustee Shuaib Yusaf said: &#8220;If it was designated as a Muslim session to encourage Muslim women to come along, to that extent I could see a degree of merit in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malcolm Wicks, Labour MP for Croydon North, said asking non-Muslims to dress up to swim was not fair: &#8220;I just hope some common sense can prevail here.&#8221;</p>

		<p>  A beginning of sense in England. <br>
  Now it is time for Christians to begin objecting to Muslim dress and symbols everywhere as offensive and not English because they seek to force English Christians to stop wearing crosses or displaying Christian symbols in public, schools or on the jobs. Muslim and Sikh dress is permited but crosses and Christian symbols are not permited. <br>
  Time to claim discrimination by Muslims against Christains and Europeans in general.<br>
  Muslim, Black and other areas are  &#8220;no go zones&#8221; for whites but whites are forced to permit Muslims, Blacks and others in their areas. All can go everywhere or none can - demand it and the political correctness will start to crumble.</p>

This is an old political trick.</p>
<p>You make a proposition that is extreme. So extreme that it can&rsquo;t pass. But then you make a compromise and you come out ahead. The opposition believes they&rsquo;ve won when they&rsquo;ve actually lost.</p>
<p>I believe these people were duped into accepting separate swimming rules for Muslim swimmers.</p>

		<p>I say on Muslim day all fat and old people should go to the pool in bikinis - men and women - leave the muscle men and pretty girls home.  Then the Muslims can look at lots and lots of naked, wrinkled flesh.  Heck I&rsquo;d volunteer to gross &#8216;em out!</p>

<p>I love that idea! Why should we allow third-worlders to oggle our women and at the same time they are allowed to be obsessively overprotective of their own?</p>
