<h1>Lawsuit Filed Against Dearborn Schools and Muslim Principal Over Firing of Christian Wrestling Coach</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas More Law Center, July 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Thomas More Law Center, a national public interest law firm based in Ann Arbor, Michigan announced today that a federal lawsuit has been filed against a Dearborn, Michigan high school, Fordson High School, and its Muslim principal, Imad Fadlallah, over the firing of Gerald Marszalek because of Marszalek&rsquo;s connection to a Christian volunteer coach.</p>
<p>Marszalek, who had coached wrestling for 35 years, had achieved a legendary status in the wrestling community. {snip} Marszalek&rsquo;s contract was not renewed because of his association with a Christian volunteer coach, Trey Hancock, who the principal accused of converting a Muslim student to Christianity during a summer camp not connected with the school or Coach Marszalek.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Richard Thompson, President and Chief Counsel of the Thomas More Law Center commented, &#8220;We are getting a glimpse of what happens when Muslims who refuse to accept American values and principles gain political power in an American community. Failure to renew coach Marszalek&rsquo;s contract had nothing to do with wrestling and everything to do with religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The city of Dearborn is one of the most densely populated Muslim communities in the United States. An estimated 30,000 of its 98,000 residents are Muslims. It is estimated that 80% of the student population of Fordson High School is Arabic and most of those are Muslims. According to the lawsuit, Fadlallah has publically stated that he sees Fordson High School as a Muslim school.</p>
<p>Trouble started between Fadlallah and Marszalek when one of Coach Marszalek&rsquo;s assistant coaches, Trey Hancock, held a summer wrestling camp in which a Muslim camper converted to Christianity. Principal Fadlallah was so upset by the conversion that he punched the student and informed him he had disgraced his family. Fadlallah also ordered Coach Marszalek to ban the assistant coach from the high school and all wrestling events. {snip} Unfortunately for Coach Marszalek, his teacher&rsquo;s Union did not help him in his hour of need.</p>

		<p>I wrestled in high school and still follow the sport and reading this article is amazing. I mean, wrestling has got to be one of the Whitest activities in America. Every guy on my multi-racial wrestling team in high school was a Christian most were Catholic. I guess Muslims have to ruin one of the sports Whites dominate.</p>

		<p>Actually, the person who should really be worried is the student that converted to Christianity.  Stories about the stoning or beheading of Muslims in the Muslim world that turn &#8220;traitor&#8221; are about a weekly occurrence on Jihad Watch and Dhimmi Watch websites.</p>

		<p>Principal Fadlallah should be fired.  If this is indeed a Muslim school, then all public money(federal, state and local)should be withdrawn.  It&rsquo;s becoming clear that Islam is incompatible with any other religion or belief system.</p>

		<p>Why does this principal still have his job after punching a student? Assaulting a minor is a serious crime and he should have been held to account for that. </p>
<p>Of course, being a Muslim school, nobody cares I guess, as long as it is not a Christian punching out a Muslim, then the screams of outrage could be heard well beyond the Dearborn city limits!</p>

<p>Yes, and they act EXACTLY as all the other tribes do.  They have their hats in their hands, assuming the poor but grateful, noble immigrant when they want in and as soon as their numbers reach a certain point they begin the process of trying to take control and convert the country to something more to their liking.  And, invariably, all of them whine about what we teach in our schools, our traditional values, and our high profile figures we have been celebrating long before they came and we were the only ones here. &#8220;Hey, hey, ho, ho, Western Culture has got to go.&#8221;   </p>
<p>The amazing thing about the entire debacle is that there are actually white oddballs who agree with these ingrates, venting their hatred for Sarah Palin types who want the old America back, before this mess of multicultural rabble fled to our shores.</p>
<p>But, as long as the spineless white politicians and other elitists, especially the cowardly academics, insist on catering to them and there are no loud cries of protests from any but a scant few of us, we deserve what we are getting.</p>
<p>The country is dysfunctional.  Economic collapse or not, this empire is on the way out, and thank God for that.</p>

		<p>The United States of America is bankrupt.</p>
<p>There has been a downturn and correction in the stock market.</p>
<p>Recent spending by Obama is only increasing the deficit and allowing more people to get into further debt.</p>
<p>It will not be long before the whole US is in the same position as many counties and states&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;bankrupt.</p>
<p>We will see a collapse much like the great depression.</p>
<p>But there will not be peace amongst men during this crisis.  It will be each man for himself and not sufficient police to keep things in order.</p>
<p>I believe what we have seen is a dire warning to put your affairs in order to prepare for the really big one.</p>

		<p>Muslims should attend their own schools where they can indulge their stupid superstitions. Of course the schools should be under surveillance by the FBI. Their schools are breeding grouds for terrorism.</p>

		<p>This is a bit off-topic, but to echo what the first poster said  &mdash;  Get you children involved with wrestling. Whites dominate wrestling. Not only is it a great sport, it is great for self-defense. I can assure you, a White male with a strong wrestling background can defend himself against most blacks in a fight. </p>
<p>Forget basketball, football, and the other sports that encourage thug worshipping. Get your kids involved in wrestling.</p>

		<p>Solution:mass deportation of muslims in America. Implement a national origins policy that completetly excludes muslims. This is basically the type of immigration policy that was in place before the passage of the 1965 immigration reform act.</p>
<p>If the 1965 Immigration Reform Act had not been passed, the probability of 9/11 occuring would have been 0.</p>
<p>George Bush lied through his teeth when he told the American peole that We have to send the US military to occupy Iraq and Afghanistan or otherwise Al-Queda would come here to kill Americans. This is a bold-face lie. Al-Queda was able to murder Americans because George Bush and the US congress allowed millions of muslims to come to America. </p>
<p>Deport all muslims and have a national origins policy that completetly excludes muslims and you will never have to worry about another Al-Queda attack on American soil again.</p>

		<p>     According to liberal orthodoxy the principal should have been prosecuted and fired when he first punched the convert.There is no law in this country. It&rsquo;s whatever the whim of the NY Times is.</p>

		<p>Jupiter- George Bush is a true believer in the religion of deversity. I think it was the Japanese Prime Minister that he told &#8220;Diversity is our greatest strength&#8221; when questioned about the US&rsquo; increasing diversity. After 9/11 Bush had two choices that were discussed in his cabinet-1. Seal the borders and throw out the illegals  2.Take the fight to the Muslims. Bush choose option 2.</p>
<p>I often wonder what it would be like if he had choosen the first option. After 9/11 he could have done almost anything and been supported. Instead he foolishly believed that Islam is a religion of peace and that we somehow owed them a functioning,  government. People have used the example of WW2 as to how the US can install an open,democratic government. The difference is that in Germany and Japan the belief systems that brought about their dictatorships were outlawed. Nazism and the belief that the emperor was a God were outlawd. Yet in Iraq we somehow think we can leave the value system in place that teaches  hatred and intolerance and end up with a Western society.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how we can possibly succed in either Iraq or Afghanistan, long term. The basic value system of the people preaches a religous dictatorship. Eventually someone gets around to actually reading the Koran and the fact that it preaches death to the infidel.</p>
<p>And can you imagine if a Christian Principal hit a student that converted to Islam?</p>
<p>We are not descending into a multi-cultural hell, we are there. There are a few suburban and rural pockets of resistance, but you better believe Obama and gang are out to diversify every hill and dale. </p>
