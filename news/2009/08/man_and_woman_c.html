<h1><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/two-charged-with-leaking-bnp-membership-list-1775491.html">Man and Woman Charged With BNP Membership Leak</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Davies, Independent (London), August 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man and a woman have been charged under the Data Protection Act after a British National Party membership list was leaked onto the internet, police said today.</p>
<p>Dyfed-Powys Police said the man, aged 27, and woman, aged 30, were due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates Court on 1 September.</p>
<p>The woman is understood to be Sadie Graham, who was expelled from the far-right party in late 2007 after falling out with its leadership.</p>
<p>The BNP called for a police investigation last November after the names, addresses and contact details of some 10,000 of its members were published online.</p>
<p>Party leader Nick Griffin lodged a complaint with Dyfed-Powys, his local force, on the grounds that publishing the list breached human rights and data protection laws.</p>
<p>He described the publication as &#8220;a disgraceful act of treachery&#8221; by former BNP staff members who were subsequently sacked.</p>
<p>At the time the BNP said the leak was based on its 2007 membership list, although a number of names of people who were not members had been added.</p>
<p>The list, which included details of some members&rsquo; jobs, was reported to include serving and former police officers as well as members of the armed forces.</p>
<p>In a statement, Dyfed-Powys Police said: &#8220;We can confirm that the two people arrested as part of a joint investigation with Dyfed-Powys Police and the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office in relation to alleged criminal offences under the Data Protection Act have been charged with Section 55 Data Protection Act offences.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will appear in Nottingham Magistrates Court on 1 September.</p>
<p>&#8220;The arrests followed an investigation into a complaint received about the unauthorised release of the BNP party membership list.&#8221;</p>

		<p>You have to wonder if all the hoopla is simply about reminding people they should be ashamed to be in the BNP. It&rsquo;s all about the spin. </p>

		<p>I would venture they both just get what they call a &#8220;conditional discharge&#8221; over there. Means a slap on the wrist, with an understood slap on the back for a job well done as the liberal establishent over there would see it.</p>

		<p>The unstated implication is that by revealing one is a member of the BNP one will be stigmatized and ashamed. Like &#8220;outing&#8221; a gay person or publishing the names of arrested &#8220;Johns&#8221; in newspapers. The devil with that I say. If I were British I wouldn&rsquo;t let them make me feel bad about being a member of the BNP.</p>

		<p>Was this woman some sort of plant to begin with?  I cannot imagine anyone who was ever supportive of the BNP doing something so malicious. I would not be surprised that if she and the man mentioned were in fact guilty of leaking the  names and information that she and her accomplice were never anything but some sort of plants in the BNP put there to information gather and sabotage the organization.  </p>

		<p>If the two individuals concerned weren&rsquo;t double agents controlled by MI5 handlers for a long time, or else weren&rsquo;t PAID very handsomely for the treachery, I would be very surprised.<br>
  The &#8216;grudge&rsquo; explanation simply doesn&rsquo;t stand up.</p>

		<p>  It is interesting that the British MI 5 television series currently on PBS seems to go out of its way to show the black star of the series in hot romantic action with his white female co-stars. I wouldn&rsquo;t say this necessarily represents reality, but it certainly indicates the feelings of the series writers, if not MI5 itself.</p>

		<p>It is time for the BNP membership to declare themselves and call on the remainder of white Britain to join them in defiance.  If not near it, the time is pretty much here when the issue will be meaningful.  If they continue to hide in the face of this and the growing load of evidence of a quickly collapsing white Britain, the chance to affect it in a positive way will be lost.  The end will come to every white Briton, one by one as they either flee the island or are somehow willowed out through nearly forced interracial marriage (since all white couples will not be able to find employment) or imprisonment on a one by one, individual basis.</p>
