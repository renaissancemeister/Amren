<h1>Green Bay Hires First Black Police Officer</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Buffalo News, August 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Green Bay has a black police officer for the first time in the 152-year history of its Police Department.</p>
<p>Solomon Ayres {snip} thinks his life experiences will help defuse difficult situations and make him open to different points of view.</p>
<p>Fran Jonet, president of Green Bay&rsquo;s Police and Fire Commission, says hiring a black recruit is a long-awaited step in the right direction.</p>

		<p>Pray tell, how do his &#8220;life experiences&#8221; (read: being blacks) help him to be able to diffuse difficult situations?  I guess he means that blacks will behave around black cops, which hasn&rsquo;t worked out so well in so many bigger cities.</p>

		<p>I dare say it is a step in the WRONG direction.</p>
<p> Why do they always claim their experience will help diffuse difficult situations? How? They only make it worse and they will always defend the black against the White and that is a fact. They are so anti-White and it is showing up more and more everyday.</p>

		<p>Other than some of the Green Bay Packers I don&rsquo;t think there are any blacks in Green Bay.</p>

		<p>Anybody know anyone from Green Bay?  What are they like?  Wisconsin has a LOT of descendants of German immigrants, which definitely drew much suspicion during the two World Wars.  Are they just plain American types, or were the historic suspicions correct, and half of them have, or have friends who have, portraits of the Kaiser or the Fuhrer gathering dust on the basements?  Sad legacy of WWII, by the way, that to welcome racial integration in every single American community, you get to avoid the title of Nazi.  Thanks, Germans.           </p>

		<p>Just goes to show that the great liberal north is for AA as long as it is the Old South where they deserve it. But, the northern Whites are the good Whites and should not be bothered with such baggage. </p>

		<p>The Native Born White Men of Greenbay Wisconsin ought to find some other way to spend their Sundays than sitting in a freezing cold stadium wathching young black multimillionaires running around in tight spandex. </p>

		<p>And soon, coming to Green Bay, another round of the lawsuit lottery!  </p>
<p>The new officer will soon sue the city and easily win millions because he or she wasn&rsquo;t respected enough, promoted soon enough, or someone looked at them funny.  </p>
<p>Get out the check book, Green Bay, and thank you for playing!</p>
