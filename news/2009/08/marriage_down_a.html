			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>UPI, August 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yale University sociology Professor Hannah Brueckner, who co-wrote a study regarding highly educated black women, said a growing number of them have been focusing on education rather than families and marriage during the last 40 years, the American Sociology Association reported Saturday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study on family formation and marriage longitudinal trends in the specified demographic found the marriage gap between highly educated black and white women increased dramatically between the 1970s and recent years.</p>
<p>In the 1970s the gap was 9 percent, while that gap rose to 21 percent in 2000-2007.</p>
<p>Brueckner said the growing divide may be due to a lack of acceptable partners for highly educated black women.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are less likely than black men to marry outside their race, and, compared to whites and black men, they are least likely to marry a college-educated spouse,&#8221; he suggested.<br>

		<p>Articles like this always talk about how these women are able to find &#8220;acceptable&#8221; partners.</p>
<p>It is never suggested that men (especially of other races) are less likely to desire a black woman in the first place - even the &#8220;Halle Barry&#8221; types that are 80% white.</p>

<p>  &mdash;   White men usually don&rsquo;t want Black women.  However Black men - men being the aggressor - DO want White women.  White women are more easily swayed by the media masters too.  Highly educated Black women have the &#8220;advantage&#8221; of being able to bleed the system not only because they&rsquo;re Black, but also because they&rsquo;re women.   Not even Black men can claim that.  A double whammy for White people. It is no wonder they can&rsquo;t find spouses.  They&rsquo;d have to marry Ternell the street-corner wheeler and dealer.</p>

<p>How about just telling the simple truth and admitting that black women are the least attractive of all the females of other races and that&rsquo;s why so many of them are single.</p>
<p>The fact that black men usually pursue women of other races before their own is probably the worst insult they could give their own women.</p>

		<p>As obnoxious as American white females have become, nothing is worse, in my experience, than a black female who got a degree and a nice, safe government job.  They usually become bullies and goof-offs - and drive a Mercedes.  They also seem to think they are Ophra, Aretha Franklin, and Vanessa Williams, at once, but without any real class, compassion or beauty.</p>

		<p>What exactly is their definition of a highly educated black woman?  I know a black woman who claims to have a doctorate but still speaks that ethnic slang with a &#8220;sista twang&#8221;.  No matter.  Educated, uneducated, they still can&rsquo;t land a man.  It&rsquo;s not like education would be a big turn on for a black man anyhow.  </p>

		<p>Even more interesting is the quietly inserted line &#8220;starting a family&#8221;. Intelligent blacks have never reproduced at replacement rate, and based on the statistics I have seen (NYLS), are fast becoming extinct. </p>
<p>The highest demographic for I.Q. has near a zero fecundity rate. The next standard deviation is close to one per couple (1.1). The next two S.D.&rsquo;s are at 1.8 per couple (declining over time) with only the last (Lowest I.Q.) reproducing like crazy (2.2+). In effect, the entire line of Africans here in the U.S. is rapidly reducing in I.Q., with only the very lowest I.Q. Africans breeding out those with a high I.Q. This report confirms that the female African upper I.Q. segment is not reproducing AND is selecting genetic material that is below their level even when they do reproduce.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think blacks are crazy for white girls because of their attractiveness. Many black men would prefer an unattractive white woman over a slim black one. For them, a white girl is an status symbol.</p>
<p>And interestingly, most of black women want to date white men, it&rsquo;s more visible in the upper class.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve also known many black men who never dated white women and never will be (those ones are ironically not crime prone).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whites seem to be the least racially conscious race in the world. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Highly Educated black women&#8221; may have pieces of paper that say BA, MA, PHD, JD, MD whatever, but their actual intellectual achievement is about level with a 7th grade White or Asian girl. In math it is even lower, 3rd grade.</p>
<p>Always remember that those great conservative heroes Ronald Reagan and Clarence Thomas as head of the EEOC eliminated the federal PACE exam, a simple test that required 12th grade reading and writing and 10th grade math because all those &#8220;highly educated black women&#8221; with their BAs, MAs, PHDs, JDs and MDs could not read as well as the average 12th grader or do math as well as the average 10th grader.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that the taxes of Whites provided the scholarships by which these women obtained their bogus affirmative action degrees and it is our taxes that support them in idleness in their $60,000 to $100,000 per year government, education, and federally funded not profit jobs.</p>

		<p>This is highly interesting! I mean, for several years now, the media have been forcing down our throats this fabricated idea that to White women, black males should be very attractive&hellip;<br>
I can think of examples of movies and t.v. shows in which you see a gorgeous white female going out with a Mister Yo-Yo-Yo type&hellip; Or, there was this television advertisement with Mihael Jordan in his underwear and two white women blushing&hellip; </p>
<p>But suddenly, oh!, we learn that marriage is really down, among educated Black women, and those same women say it&rsquo;s because they can&rsquo;t find partners (among black men) who would measure up to their standards.</p>
<p>Now, if educated Black women don&rsquo;t necessarily want to be with black men (especially of the hip-hop, gangsta or «&rsquo;hood» type) then what does that say about this media cliché about the educated, beautiful blue-eyed blonde White girl dating a ghetto-type Black?</p>

		<p>I am an attorney and I work with lots of these educated black women who can&rsquo;t find a good man.  And yes lots of them are smart and attractive in their own way, especially when they can afford to get their hair professionally braided.  Many 50 year old black women could pass for 30.  They hardly age at all.</p>
<p>This is a very sad situation and does not bode well for the future of the black race.  It is very peculiar that among blacks the women seem to be smarter than the men.  Women, I find, usually want men who are just a little bit smarter than they are.  Rampant homosexuality and faithlessness don&rsquo;t help either.  The demise of religion in this country has devastated blacks even more than whites.</p>

		<p>My wife and I (both of us are White) were in a restaraunt in Washington D.C. last winter. It was an upscale one. During our dinner we noticed how many more Black women there appeared to be as opposed to virtually no Black men. In fact, the only two Black men outside of the waiters we saw were a father and young boy. </p>
<p>Moreover, many of these women were with other female friends, White men or other non-Black men. To have so many professioanal Black women outnumber Black men is certainly not good for Blacks as far as the future is concerned. </p>
<p>My wife commented that it must be frustrating for professional Black women as far as finding a suitable Black men. This experience confirms it.</p>

<p>  &mdash;   Wake up Deniz.  They certainly do want to date White girls for their attractiveness.  I agree though that a white girl is a status symbol.  There is no way that &#8220;most of black women want to date white men&#8221;.  A few upper class Black women might want to do that but nearly every upper class Black woman already has a good deal of White in her.  They&rsquo;re mostly mulattoes and if some of them do want White men, it&rsquo;s the White part of them that does, not the Black part.</p>

<p>Black women age well but it comes at a price: low levels of vitamin D.  They don&rsquo;t spend enough time outdoors (for fear the sun will turn them pitch black) and that places them at risk for disease.  On the other hand, whites who spend alot of time outdoors put themselves at risk for skin cancer.  <br>

<p>I am not too sure. There are many black men with unattractive white women (and of course with many strange looking children) but few white men with unattractive black women. </p>
<p>But the opposite, white man/educated black woman is becoming more common.</p>
<p>A white girl whether she&rsquo;s beautiful or not, is a victory for a black man even if more attractive black ones are available. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t approve mixed marriages or couples but if I was an educated black woman I wouldn&rsquo;t go for a black one, too.</p>

<p><i>However, I&rsquo;ve also known many black men who never dated <b>white</b> women and never will be (those ones are ironically not crime prone).</i></p>
<p>Those who are crazy for white girls tend to be thugs, &#8220;killaz&#8221;, gang members, etc&hellip;  For example, many people find southern blacks friendlier.</p>

		<p>I believe I have read a similar article to this before. As a Black woman who is often told that I am very attractive, it gets on my nerves when people say Black women are not married because people think they are ugly. I know alot of beautiful Black women (educated and not-so educated)Many people fail to understand is that educated Black women are asked out, hit on, etc by Black men, but many of these Black men do not measure up to the women&rsquo;s standards. For example, alot of women do not want a Black man with a criminal record or one that is not employed or under-employed.</p>
<p>I find that when I date Black men alot of times I have to dumb myself down. I do not want to offend anyone. When I go out with White men they like to discuss books, art, politics etc in an intelligent way, but I can only count three Black men I dated that liked to read and liked art. I only have a Bachelors degree, but imagine how a woman with a PHd would feel having to go through that. All people deserve someone who will like them for themselves. They should not have to put on an act.</p>
<p>I also have a question for some White readers. Do you feel that too many Whites have gotten too promiscuous these days? And if so are you trying to help your daughters not become this way? I see too many White women who are very eager to open their legs for any Black man who tells them they are cute. I bring this up because last weekend I went out to a nightclub with 4 other female acquaintances (me-Black, 2-White,1-Black, and the other was 1/2 Mexican 1/2 Black) I just wanted to dance and have a few drinks. I was not interested in hooking up with anyone.  We were hit on all night by men of various races, but one Black guy would not leave me alone.  To make a long story short he finally asked me to go to the restroom with him to provide oral sex. I refused and one of the White ladies I was with thought I was crazy for turning him down!!! She then tried to look for him and later on that night she disappeared. She rejoined us right before we left and we all went to IHOP along with some other guys we met. While we were dining she told be she found that guy and hooked up with him in the restroom! My other friends thought it was nasty but she said he was too cute to resist, but TRUST ME he was not all that. I do not know if she was lying or not and I do not mean to judge people, but there are too many crazy people to just go around having random sex like that.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not at all surprised Primavera told a disgusting story about a promiscuous white woman.  I have heard similar stories from other black women.  Almost all of my friends have been white women and none of them would have been desperate to degrade themselves with a black man in the manner she described.  I doubt black women and their stories because black women are known for being very bitter toward white women in general and I can confirm that based on my own interactions with them.  Also they are known, as in the case of the Duke stripper and Tawana Brawley for telling tall tales about white men.  I do agree that American culture is ridiculously sexed up but that&rsquo;s another story.   Some even say we can thank blacks for that because we have been &#8220;africanized.&#8221;  </p>

<p>I for one, do believe Primavera&rsquo;s Story. Black female jealousy of White women aside. Just because you have a racially conscious group of White female friends (and that&rsquo;s good), there is enough evidence to prove that more than a few young White women(and young men as Anoynomous at 12:25  and a number of other posters have mentioned) who have no problem engaging in any sort of miscegenation.</p>

		<p>Mark I know many white women from all classes and backgrounds.  Some of them are attracted to black men but not enough to go into the bathroom of a nightclub and perform oral sex on a strange black man.  Women of any race that engage in that behavior are diseased.  White women do not have high numbers of STDs.  Blacks on the other hand do have higher rates of STDs.  </p>
