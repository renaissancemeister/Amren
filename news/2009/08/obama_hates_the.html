<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=105910">Obama Hates the White Man</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rev. Jesse Lee Patterson, WorldNetDaily, August 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>Barack Obama hates white people  &mdash;  especially white men. Sorry folks, but the truth will set you free!</p>
<p>Why else would Obama falsely accuse Sgt. James Crowley and other Cambridge Police officers of &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; and claim they &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221;  &mdash;  creating a national racial controversy?</p>
<p>For months, I have said that Barack Obama was elected as a result of white fear (guilt) and black racism. Whites voted for him because of guilt and the fear of being called &#8220;racist.&#8221; And the 96 percent of blacks who voted for the &#8220;Messiah&#8221; did so because of his race and his &#8220;spread the wealth&#8221; notions.</p>
<p>Despite the stark reality of Obama&rsquo;s close association with black racists like the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr., many white Americans hoped for the best and cast their ballot for the &#8220;post-racial&#8221; candidate, Obama.</p>
<p>The new president assembled his left-wing policy wonks and Chicago henchmen, and within six months into his presidency he has tried to radically alter and fundamentally socialize every major American industry from banking to health care.</p>
<p>What can we learn about our new president by analyzing his personality quirks? Find out what the experts say in Whistleblower magazine&rsquo;s &#8220;Narcissist in Chief&#8221; edition</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that he nominated the &#8220;wise Latina&#8221; Sonia Sotomayor and appointed Eric Holder attorney general. Holder, best-known for signing off on Bill Clinton&rsquo;s pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich, also stirred controversy when he referred to America as a &#8220;nation of cowards.&#8221; Obama wants to transform the judicial system and rule of law into &#8220;social justice&#8221; to address &#8220;racial inequalities&#8221;  &mdash;  and he has a committed comrade in Eric Holder.</p>
<p>For instance, note the Holder Justice Department&rsquo;s order to dismiss the charges against the New Black Panther Party members (including one who wielded a nightstick) who had been charged with voter intimidation in Philadelphia during November&rsquo;s election. This was considered to be one of the most blatant cases of voter intimidation since the &rsquo;60s, yet Obama&rsquo;s chief law enforcement officer once again let the criminals walk.</p>
<p>Barack Obama is dividing the races like no other president in history  &mdash;  and his polls numbers reflect that. A poll by the Pew Research Center found that Obama&rsquo;s popularity slipped among whites after the Gates controversy from 53 percent to 46 percent. Among blacks and Hispanics, his numbers went up from 63 percent to 74 percent. Overall job approval was 54 percent, down from 61 percent in a mid-June Pew poll.</p>
<p>Both Obama and his friend Henry Louis Gates are racist. Keep in mind also that Gates&rsquo; attorney, Charles Ogletree, was Barack Obama&rsquo;s law professor at Harvard. We&rsquo;re dealing with liberal-elite, cunning black intellectuals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I realize that Crowley was under a great deal of pressure to get along, but he should have had the courage to demand an apology and tell the president and Gates: 1) They were wrong, and 2) Their phony photo op and &#8220;beer summit&#8221; at the White House won&rsquo;t cleanse their racist hearts.</p>
<p>President Obama spoke of this being a teachable moment, and it certainly is for white Americans. The lesson is that they need to speak up or lose their country! All accounts indicate that in this instance, the moment was missed and Sgt. Crowley was conned. The focus has subtly shifted from the false accusations of a racist black man to racial profiling from the dreaded white man.</p>

		<p>Jessie L. Peterson, unlike so many black preachers, has been working his a  &mdash;   off in South Central Los Angeles for years. His message isn&rsquo;t very popular with many African Americans, because it directly goes against the tenants of the Great Society Programs of welfare food stamps, and having the Central Government as your parents. Two generations of black people have been ruined by these programs. Peterson understands, that these so-called progressive policies cannot and will not give blacks the sense of dignity that only self reliance and hard work will. The Rev. Peterson has been threatened in the past by Jacksons goons, and other race hustlers, and I can&rsquo;t help but give the man credit for what he&rsquo;s been trying to do against such overwhelming odds.</p>
<p>Question: Where are all the progressives with money, the West Coast liberals, the Hollywood crowd,,etc.,that have been trying to help Rev.Peterson? Their quiet as church mice, and that says it all, when it comes to their progressiveness.</p>

		<p>The few blacks who will admit to what&rsquo;s to really going on and who see the big picture are simply ignored. If they can&rsquo;t smear them as &#8216;racist&rsquo; or &#8216;self-hating&rsquo; the MSM simply pretends they don&rsquo;t exist. That&rsquo;s the case with Rev. Peterson and others. </p>

		<p>Obama doesn&rsquo;t hate whites nearly as much as he hates the debased white blood running through his black veins&hellip;</p>
