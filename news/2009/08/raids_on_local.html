<h1>Raids on Local Somalis Over Khat Smuggling Results in Fallout</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Carter, Seattle Times, August 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The raids were part of &#8220;Operation Somalia Express,&#8221; a national crackdown on the smuggling of &#8220;khat,&#8221; a leafy herb that is illegal is the United States but as commonplace as a cup of coffee in the Horn of Africa, where it has been chewed for centuries for its effect as a mildly euphoric stimulant.</p>
<p>Agents conducted 17 searches in Seattle alone, along with dozens of other raids in New York, Minnesota and Ohio. In all, 44 people were indicted on charges of conspiracy, money laundering and other federal drug-related felonies, many carrying prison sentences of 20 years. In Seattle, 19 men were indicted, including Ali Dualeh and Abdigafar Ali Hassan, Habibo Jama&rsquo;s uncle.</p>
<p><b>A failure</b></p>
<p>By almost any measure, however, Operation Somalia Express was a failure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors in New York obtained 10-year prison sentences against two ringleaders of the operation, but most of the defendants there went free, as well. Jama and Dualeh are now suing the DEA and several local police agencies, including the Seattle and Tukwila departments, that helped in the raids. The suits allege the violent entries into the Dualeh and Jama homes by armed SWAT teams were unnecessary and violated their Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>
<p>Some law-enforcement officials and Somali community leaders are saying the fallout from the operation has poisoned relations between law enforcement and the communities at a time when federal agents are looking for help.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, as many as 20 Somali men have disappeared from Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., apparently recruited in area mosques to wage jihad in their own country.</p>
<p>Some have turned up fighting for a radical Islamic group in Somalia called Al-Shabaab, which U.S. intelligence sources have tied to al-Qaida. One American youth blew himself up at a U.N. checkpoint last October, according to federal investigators.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice recently revealed that a 25-year-old Somali refugee from Seattle, Abdifatah Yusuf Isse, has pleaded guilty to providing support to terrorists in connection with U.S. recruitment efforts by Al-Shabaab.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very difficult community to walk into,&#8221; said one law-enforcement official assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Seattle who spoke on condition of anonymity because he does not have permission to talk to the media. &#8220;There is a lot of mistrust there and part of it is because of these raids.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Strained relations</b></p>
<p>Omar Jamal, who operates the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in St. Paul, said the khat arrests damaged a relationship that already had been strained by Treasury Department raids on small, informal Somali money exchanges, called &#8220;halawas,&#8221; in the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Fears that the halawas were being used to finance terrorism proved unfounded, and no criminal charges were ever filed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that the only relationship we have with law enforcement is when they come to arrest us,&#8221; Jamal said. &#8220;There is very little outreach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jama, who is now 31, is also seeking damages against Tukwila police for seizing her life savings  &mdash;  $5,700 in cash scrimped from her job cleaning hotel rooms. The city moved to forfeit the cash as the proceeds of drug crimes, even though no drugs were found in the home.</p>
<p>Jama got her money back 10 months later, but only after a federal judge said he was &#8220;troubled&#8221; by the runaround and wondered why a local police department was forfeiting property seized as part of a federal investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Jama also alleges that officers took gold jewelry from her bedroom and never returned it.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca Cohen, who is defending the government in the lawsuit, said there is no evidence jewelry was seized and the agents question &#8220;whether there was ever any jewelry in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jama and Dualeh&rsquo;s wife, Jawaher Shreh, are both devout Muslims and say they were humiliated by officers who refused to let them cover their heads in accordance with religious tenets that require women to wear a hijab  &mdash;  or head scarf  &mdash;  outside the home and in the presence of men they do not know.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges Jama repeatedly asked for clothes, but was photographed by officers wearing only a sheer nightdress and forced to sit, handcuffed, on a curb for more than five hours in front of her neighbors and passers-by.</p>
<p><b>Forced entry challenged</b></p>
<p>The Jama lawsuit also seeks a court finding that the Seattle Police Department&rsquo;s (SPD) policy for using forced entry during a raid is unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that police must &#8220;knock and announce&#8221; unless there is a real threat to officer safety or that evidence might be destroyed.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed by Seattle lawyers Tim Ford and David Whedbee, alleges SPD has a &#8220;dynamic entry&#8221; protocol to use force in all narcotics searches, with not more than a 10-second delay between announcing themselves and breaking in.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SPD maintains an unconstitutional practice &hellip; where officers automatically use force in every instance, including violent restraint and threat of deadly force, without having to balance the need for force&#8221; with the particular circumstances of the search, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>The city, in a response to the lawsuit, denies its practice is unconstitutional and said its officers were acting under the direction of the DEA. {snip}<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have important relations with community leaders, police, the mayor, or even the local garbage collector. Perhaps I just haven&rsquo;t been in the country long enough.  </p>

		<p>While it is true that gat is a blight upon Northeast African/Yemeni societies.  This is only true because it is a national obsession.  Men sit around for hours chewing gat instead of being productive.  However, as far as drugs go, gat is very mild indeed.  You have to chew a lot, and for a long time, to get any results.  I&rsquo;ve tried it (not in this country)and I guess it&rsquo;s an acquired taste.</p>

		<p>Somalia, unlike Europe and America, is not suited for the industrialized lifestyle.</p>
<p>It is in the people&rsquo;s best interest to find ways to pass the long, hot afternoons in the horn of Africa.  Chewing khat is an acceptable norm in that laid-back region of the world.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t transport well to the West, where the norms are caffiene and nicotine.  These legal drugs compliment the busy work-a-day lifestyle of the West.</p>

		<p>ALL nonwhite communities do this. They protect their own no matter what the crime. Look at the OJ trial. Illegals are well known to protect their criminals and gang members also.</p>

<p>Yeah, cops come by my place all the time just to chat.  I think we have some cultural differences, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>
<p>Other than that, I side with the Somalis.  This &#8220;drug war&#8221; is nothing more that an attack on Constitutional Rights, with unconstitutional forfeiture of money and property, totally <br>
innocent people having their houses raided and being killed in the process, grandma losing her house because her grandson is dealing weed from the house without her knowledge, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Is anyone aware that civil forfeiture is at least a $2 billion/yr racket here in America, and has been for some time?  &#8220;Law Enforcement&#8221; charges money and/or property with a &#8220;crime&#8221; (which is ludicrous) and YOU have to prove it innocent to get your money and/or property back!  What a deal!  And I thought we had a Fourth Amendment (due process and all that archaic, dead white European racist slave-owning male patriarchal oppressive nonsense).</p>
<p>Finally, if &#8220;khat&#8221; is what it is as described in the article, this is just more goverment lunacy, enforcing stupid laws that only hurt people and protect no one.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because they consider whites to be criminal: whites and white society. Everyone gets the message that&rsquo;s who the real criminals are.  </p>

		<p>i&rsquo;ve known some hard working and straight edged somalis, so i don&rsquo;t want to generalize. but i must say it pissed me off when i read how they whined and cried about their rights being violated, especially when they were treated like any other suspect. what the somalis are not telling anyone is that in their home country, their doors would simply be kicked in at 3am, the whoe family ruffed up and the suspects hauled off to a hell hole. the state (there really is no such thing there, but&hellip;.)would not have to prove their gulit. the suspects would have to prove their innocence and should they wind up incarcerated, family members would be responsible for feeding them, not the authorities. i don&rsquo;t buy their act for one minute. nor do i feel much sympathy for them. </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s needed is a pan-Western police conference to discuss and identify common concerns with Somalis.  The police forces of Canada, Sweden, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, United States, Germany, the Netherlands - each is discovering the joys of  Somalis in their midst.</p>
<p>They are compelled to recruit Somalis into their police forces in order to penetrate their communities. These Somalis in uniform are then shunned or targetted for beatings. </p>
<p>A combined forces police report on Somalis would only draw one conclusion: Somali immigration means a crimewave for the host country.    </p>

		<p>Have I got it right?  Somali community leaders are saying that if U.S. officials enforce U.S. laws in Somali communities, it sours relations between law enforcement and the communities.  So, the solution must be to not enforce U.S. laws in Somali communities.  Yeah, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>

		<p>Why is khat illegal? Is it any worse than tobacco?  Who cares?  I know, the government agencies that want to employ more non Whites for their alternative to welfare affirmative action jobs.</p>
<p>A guy from Yemen told me about khat.  He says that in Yemen and other Arab and African countries the weather is so hot and  humid that the only way to get through the 120 degree days is to get up around 4/am, do some work, cook the main meal of the day, eat and them spend the time from about 11am to 6pm lying around comatose from the khat.  It&rsquo;s like a painkiller to get one through the heat of the day.</p>
<p>Around 6pm everyone gets up and does some more work, plays with the kids, fixes supper, eats, socializes.</p>
