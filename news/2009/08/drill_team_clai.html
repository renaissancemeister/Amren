<h1>Drill Team Claims Racial Discrimination</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WTNH-TV (New Haven, Connecticut), August 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The National Drill Squad and Drum Corps was in Kansas City earlier this week for a national competition. But the team leader says his group was scared and felt intimidated when the hotel they were staying in ordered them to leave at 1:30 a.m.</p>
<p>The hotel strongly denies that charge, saying it was the group&rsquo;s behavior that led to the them being ordered off the premises.</p>
<p>Douglas Bethea described how several police officers carrying Tasers banged on their hotel rooms and ordered all 48 people in the group to leave the Sheraton Kansas City Sports Complex early Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The team, which features 32 kids ages 4 to 18, had checked in on Sunday and Bethea described the eviction as the breaking point of three days of discriminatory treatment at the hotel. The group alleges that hotel staff referred to members of the all black group with racial innuendos.</p>
<p>But the hotel says it received more than a dozen noise complaints from other guests. Kansas City police tell News Channel 8 that they also received complaints from hotel guests over the three day period. The Sheraton&rsquo;s manager says the drill team was warned multiple times to quiet down or the hotel would have no choice but to have them removed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They referred to us as &#8216;you people&rsquo; and &#8216;we don&rsquo;t deal with people like you,&rsquo; so I mean you explain to me &#8216;you people,&rsquo; what does that mean?&#8221; Bethea questioned. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t deal with &#8216;you loud people,&rsquo; they didn&rsquo;t say they, we don&rsquo;t deal with &#8216;you people.&rsquo; To me, yes, that&rsquo;s a racial comment. If it wasn&rsquo;t about race, how do you put 48 people out of a hotel, give them 15 minutes or say you will be removed by force.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [the hotel&rsquo;s manager] went on to say &#8220;it&rsquo;s an unfortunate situation, but it&rsquo;s the hotel&rsquo;s responsibility to maintain a quiet and restful environment for all our guests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bethea admits his team has been loud in the past, going so far as to say that that the team should have been kicked out of other hotels. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bethea is also speaking with local members of the NAACP in New Haven who are talking with their counterparts in Kansas City about a possible lawsuit against the Sheraton and its parent company.</p>
<p>For Betha, he says pursuing legal action is not about money but respect.<br>

<p>In what staff called a &#8220;highly unusual&#8221; move, the Sheraton Kansas City Sports Complex Hotel evicted the 35 kids and 13 chaperons from their hotel rooms at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, citing repeated noise complaints from people who were trying to sleep nearby.</p>
<p>The hotel called in police officers to kick the group out. No arrests were made.</p>
<p>Doug Bethea, leader of the Nation Drill Team, called the eviction a &#8220;horrible&#8221; end to an otherwise successful trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve never in my life experienced something like this,&#8221; Bethea said. He accused the hotel of racial discrimination and vowed to litigate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all boils down to, they had 48 black people in their hotel and they did not like it,&#8221; Bethea said. The hotel denied that charge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Get Out Of Here Now&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Ten police officers banged on his hotel door wielding Taser stun guns at about 1:30 a.m., he said. Hotel staff was there, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want you guys out of here now,&#8221; they told the drill team, according to Bethea. The cops didn&rsquo;t use the Tasers, but their presence scared the kids, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He asked why the police needed to wake up all the children, including three babies, in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no justification&#8221; for that, he said. He asked the hotel to let these kids stay; he would get them out in the morning.</p>
<p>The hotel refused.</p>
<p>According to the hotel&rsquo;s general manager, Ted Frerking, Bethea had already been warned that the group was on the verge of eviction. Staff had received repeated complaints about the group being noisy ever since the drill team checked in Sunday night, he said. On Tuesday at 10:30 p.m., they got two more noise complaints from guests.</p>
<p>Hotel staff gave the drill team a &#8220;final warning,&#8221; Frerking said. Then, at 1:20 a.m., they got two more guest complaints. They made the decision to kick the group out. Since it was such a large group, they called police for help with the eviction, Frerking said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The eviction was carried through without incident, according to Sgt. Stacey Graves, a public information officer for the Kansas City police. She confirmed that a staff person at the hotel called police at 1:20 a.m. Wednesday. The caller said a large group was refusing to leave the hotel. They were &#8220;arguing about payment, and arguing with security,&#8221; she said. Police showed up at the hotel and resolved the issue, she said. She said the police did carry Tasers, which are standard issue on police uniforms. No arrests were made and no police report was written, she said.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;A Reality Call&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Reached by phone Wednesday, Bethea and two members of the trip said they had been discriminated against by the hotel all week. Bethea said the New Haveners were among the few black people at the largely white hotel.</p>
<p>Racial tension first materialized Monday night, when about five teenagers went down to the hotel bar to get something to eat. An intoxicated patron at the bar made a remark to the effect of &#8220;wow, look at the black people,&#8221; according to Bethea. Heated words flew.</p>
<p>Bethea was called downstairs to resolve the situation. There was no fight, but the kids were on the verge. &#8220;These kids were ready to do whatever they had to do to survive,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Frerking said the New Haven kids misconstrued a statement made by a bar patron. He said they thought the remark was about them, but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Diane Wilson, a chaperon and the grandmother of a 11-year-old on the trip, said racial profiling took other forms, too: The group wasn&rsquo;t given room service for two days, was denied new rolls of toilet paper, and was subjected to racially charged remarks by hotel staff, she asserted.</p>
<p>As one hotel staffer got off an elevator, she was overheard saying &#8220;there&rsquo;s a bunch of them running around here,&#8221; Wilson said. Wilson took the remark to have a racial connotation.</p>
<p>Ronald Huggins said he heard a female staffer say the New Haven kids were &#8220;all over the place like roaches.&#8221; Huggins, Bethea&rsquo;s nephew, drums on the drill team and helps manage the team.</p>
<p>Frerking said he didn&rsquo;t know anything about those allegations. He denied the group was mistreated on account of race.</p>
<p>&#8220;We treat all our guests fairly. It had nothing to do with the group other than the noise,&#8221; said Frerking. &#8220;Like any room, if they&rsquo;re noisy, we would ask them to depart.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The disruption was starting to be costly, he added: Frerking said the hotel has had to compensate seven guests with free nights&rsquo; stays on account of the drill team&rsquo;s noise.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reached on the 22-hour bus ride back to New Haven, Bethea vowed to file a racial discrimination lawsuit.</p>
<p>To top off their trip, Bethea and Huggins said the group was called &#8220;monkeys&#8221; by a client at the second hotel. The person told them to &#8220;go back to Africa,&#8221; according to Huggins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m upset and appalled,&#8221; said Huggins. He said the trip served as &#8220;a reality call&#8221; for the kids on the team, many of whom don&rsquo;t otherwise get to leave New Haven. He said the trip showed him that in America, &#8220;certain parts have progressed, and other parts are still behind.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think that this whole case boils down to a loud, obnoxious group of blacks who tend to have very thin skin to begin with. I did not see where anyone called the group the &#8220;n-word&#8221; or anything even closely related. Pretty soon just about anything a White person says to a black person will be construed as &#8220;a racist remark&#8221; since when are the phrases &#8220;you people&#8221; or &#8220;there are a bunch of them running around&#8221; applied to a single race. Since when is a hotel responsible for the behavior of a couple of boorish guests.Like the swimming pool incident from earlier this summer, this is just a case of playing the &#8220;ghetto lottery&#8221; Not wanting to appear &#8220;raciss&#8221; the hotel will knuckle under and pay up. Unfortunately the next time such an obnoxious group shows up and disrupts the entire hotel the management will be loathe to throw them out and will more than likely lose business. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Ordered to leave at 1:30am&hellip;.&#8221; Speaking as a guy that rolls over in bed at 10:03 pm., all I can say is Thank God! And from the article. &#8220;They were all over the hotel like roaches&hellip;&#8221; Uhh-no. Roaches are silent&hellip; And&hellip; They were called &#8220;monkeys&#8221; by a client at the second hotel. The client I assume is a guest. And therefore the hotel is not gonna be found liable for what HE says. And finally, I`ve met a lot of hotel &#8220;clients.&#8221;  Most of em are good hearted guys  on the road who been treating the busboys and the barbacks  like princes soo long, that you just love to treat em like Kings in return. Must have been something to realy, really rile the guy. </p>

		<p>I used to know a guy who made a life out of &#8220;partying&#8221; in hotels. One of his maxims was that another guest will &#8220;Think&#8221; he smelled something in the hallway, but will &#8220;Know&#8221; he heard something. He used to say, &#8220;In Hotel town, drugs won`t get ya busted, but the rock-n-roll will.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What did these people expect the hotel to do after being warned many times? and then to claim racism as an excuse for their poor behavior? It&rsquo;s no wonder they are not wanted in any place that is civilized.</p>

		<p>Well, I guess if groups of blacks acted civilized in public places, then none of this would have happened. Their reputations precede them&hellip;.LOUD and OBNOXIOUS!!!! But, it&rsquo;s ALWAYS racism if they are reprimanded for their horrible behavior because, in their minds, they should get an eternal pass for the grave injustices committed against them. I am at the point now that if I go any place where large numbers of blacks are congregating, I immediately leave and my wife doesn&rsquo;t question me either.</p>

		<p>What I notice about this is the weak attempts to equate and excuse their boorish behaviour with allegations that certain whites made remarks about them.  </p>
<p>They seem supremely confident the racism card will work, no matter how flimsy, transparent, and self-servingly played.</p>

		<p>What nightmare scenario for the hotel managers: a bunch of poorly supervised ghetto youths, all outfitted with drums. Ask the blacks to be respectful (ha,ha) and quiet down and you get smacked with a lawsuit; ignore the complaints of the other, civilized guests and you have to comp rooms and lose money. No matter what action you take, your hotel gets a bad reputation.</p>
<p>BTW I notice that referring to people as &#8220;people&#8221; is now a racist act.   </p>

		<p>I never had a &#8220;Drill Team&#8221; in my high school, is it like Band for people too unfocused and undicsiplined to read sheet music and play instruments?</p>
<p>On the video I can&rsquo;t figure out what is supposed to going on, a few adults pounding on drums while a few teenage girls, many of them fat, and at least one appearing pregnant, gyrate their posteriors spastically, and then do a few spins and stomps in attempted synchronized manner but totally lacking any precision.</p>
<p>So is it like rap video training camp or some kind of mating ritual? Can&rsquo;t figure it out. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Bethea was called downstairs to resolve the situation. There was no fight, but the kids were on the verge. &ldquo;These kids were ready to do whatever they had to do to survive,&rdquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had to get into a fight to survive?  And, of course, they were blameless.</p>
<p>I mean this is black inability to logic, straight up, as well as more uncontrolled crybaby whining.  This is just another instance that vividly reveals that blacks have no place in a civilized nation.</p>
<p>The hotel should have made some excuse about no vacancies when the reservations were made.  Any white aware person in the country knows that it&rsquo;s asking for trouble if he were to accept blacks, especially as tenants.  Loud out-of-control scenarios are not the worst these types create.  Assaults and murders occur as well.</p>

		<p>No surprise here. Among the many other things we know about Blacks, we also know they are LOUD&hellip;unbelievably loud, incomprehensibly and obnoxiously loud. And they are almost always loud - they have no volume knob - it is max volume 24/7. Needless to say, most of polite society is less than thrilled to have people like that in their midst, whatever their race happens to be!</p>

		<p>I was hoping you would post this story, because, when I read it in my newspaper, I knew exactly what went on, without even being there.</p>
<p>When I lived in Memphis, the Memphis Symphony Orchestra was performing a symphony at, as I recall, the Memphis auditorium.<br>
A black group was also having a meeting in the same building. They were SO LOUD that the symphony conductor actually stopped the performance and went over and asked the blacks to keep it down. </p>
<p>Blacks are simply loud. Period. They LIKE it that way.</p>
<p>Whites like introspection, solitude, and thinking  &mdash;  from which comes our creativity and inventiveness.  Blacks can, and do,  degrade this so very quickly.</p>
<p>Wherever are blacks, is also chaos.  <br>

		<p>Bethea states they have been loud and were kicked out of other hotels? Yet now he is claiming racism and pursuing legal action???  Well, we all know what that&rsquo;s about don&rsquo;t we&hellip;$$$$$$$$</p>
<p>BTW, does ANYONE believe what these kids say were racial remarks really true?  I don&rsquo;t. Of course they are going to claim all kinds of racial innuendos directed at them. That is a given in all these cases, isn&rsquo;t it?  How else are they going to get their $$$ and legal counsel? They need to be made an example of and proven to be nothing but liars.</p>

		<p>Even if you had a video of a sound level meter constantly getting pegged, and recorded the noise on an audio program and could later analyze the volume peaks etc, recorded all the voices of the phone calls coming in to the hotel switchboard to compain, it would still be &#8216;racist&rsquo; when the MSM got done with it. </p>
<p>There is no reasoning with minds firmly entrenched in the victim mentality, even if confronted with absolute scientific proof they were making a ruckus. </p>
<p>Anybody on either side of their room(s) that complained would be a racist, or in the case of Black neighbors, Uncle Tom would suffice nicely.</p>

		<p>The only good thing I can see happening in a few decades is that all the coddling and pampering of blacks in this country will end.  They will have to make it on their own merits or fail, period.  Blacks will not be artificially propped up beyond their contributions to society by the ruling Chinese overlords nor the majority Mexican population nor any of the other non-white minorities who collectively will make up 80% of America.</p>
<p>Blacks will remember wistfully how fun their lives used to be in the decades when they socially bullied whites and whites timidly handed them money, power and special privileges.</p>

<p>hmmmm not racial slurs, but racial innuendos! What exactly does that mean? That they somehow implied race? Either way, I am not surprised at their allegations. These days, no matter how badly blacks behave, if someone calls them out on their behavior, they will be sure to cry racism. It&rsquo;s much too convenient a crutch for them, even with a black man in the White house. This aspect of their character will never change.</p>

		<p>This is just one more example why you DON&rsquo;T want blacks&rsquo; business if you own a store, restaurant, hotel etc. Blacks are simply more trouble then they are worth. It isn&rsquo;t worth your while to do business with them.</p>

<p>Uh-huh.  Just like the respect for the other hotel tenants who were trying to sleep.  At 1:30 AM, why weren&rsquo;t these so called chaperones making sure these kids were in bed?</p>
<p>Anyone here can easily imagine the scene as these kids ran un and down the halls, yelling and pounding on doors.  I am positive alchohol was snuck up to some of the rooms, and the chaperones partook.  </p>
<p>Sadly, we all know what will happen.  Sheraton will cave, appologize, give money to these blacks, and agree to diversity training.</p>

		<p>it may well be the hispanic population will deal with black&rsquo;s in a more honest way. Whites want to tiptoe around them for fear of slighting or pissing them off no matter how badly they act. In fact they are rewarded for it whereas hispanics are not afraid to call them on it. Whatever incident happens you can be sure it will be turned into a racial incident with the usual people getting involved. The term &#8220;you people&#8221; is oblique at best. </p>

		<p>I attended am army school for six months in 1955.  We had affirmative action then and as a result here was a quota system that allowed blacks to attend.  I was lucky to be assigned to the lower floor of the barracks which was all white.  The upper floor was heavily black and the poor whites there did not get much sleep.  One white soldier tried to get a pass every weekend so that he could go to town and get one night&rsquo;s sleep in a hotel.  The prize for doing well in school was to chosen to be an instructor at the army school.  The prize was given to a black who failed the course.  Bill Bennett likes to use the military as an example of how well integration can work.  Of course, he is speaking as a draft dodger. </p>

		<p>Somehow if I was trying to use racism as a sole reason for being kicked out of a hotel, I would probably NOT want to mention that I should have been kicked out of several hotels previously for being too noisy. But that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>I have been in hotels where large groups of blacks came in after us and to a person they were loud, rowdy and uncontrollable and were so most of the night; much of it including foul and filthy ghettospeak. I have also left those hotels with my money back, explaining why.</p>

What these &#8216;drill teams&rsquo; and black school bands call performing is nothing more than fully dressed porn, with lewd and disgusting mating gyrations and reminds one of a stray dog in heat. Nothing whatsoever to do with their so-called &#8216;African culture&rsquo;, just pushing the envelope with their trashy behavior that can be defended by cries of the ever popular &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I have no doubt this group behaved obnoxiously and without one thought of discourtesy or disrespect to the other patrons of the hotel.  I have some black neighbors across the street from me (who more than likely got into the 3000+ square foot house by way of sub prime lending) who were the same way.</p>
<p>When one of them (there are several different ones in the house - I&rsquo;m not sure how many of them live there) goes outside to talk on her cell phone, I can literally hear her inside my house!  I&rsquo;ll look outside and she&rsquo;s shouting on the phone and flailing her arms while walking up and down the sidewalk.  God forbid when several of them started going outside with lawn chairs and sitting out on the lawn, and cranking up the booming bass r&b; and hip hop.  Next would come the vulgar dancing, and hooting and hollering.</p>
<p>I have no fear of blacks because I&rsquo;ve learned that most of them will blink first if you stand up to them.  At first, I tried being neighborly and asked politely for them to turn down the music.  When I got met with an attitude, I started calling the sheriff department.  Guess what?  I have no more problem and a few of the residents of this house actually wave to me and my spouse occasionally. Even when they KNOW they are wrong, they still try to play the race card.  Whites should stop backing down and start pushing back.  That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learned to do.</p>

I never had a &ldquo;Drill Team&rdquo; in my high school, is it like Band for people too unfocused and undicsiplined to read sheet music and play instruments?</p>
<p>On the video I can&rsquo;t figure out what is supposed to going on, a few adults pounding on drums while a few teenage girls, many of them fat, and at least one appearing pregnant, gyrate their posteriors spastically, and then do a few spins and stomps in attempted synchronized manner but totally lacking any precision.</p>
<p>So is it like rap video training camp or some kind of mating ritual? Can&rsquo;t figure it out. <br>
*********************</p>
<p>My sister was on a drill team in the 1970&rsquo;s, and it wasn&rsquo;t connected to the high school, but to her dance school.  There were certainly no adults in it either!<br>
Everything was very precise and HOURS of practice were involved.  They went on to national competitions several years in a row.<br>
I don&rsquo;t remember any &#8216;gyrating&rsquo; in those days, or anything resembling a mating ritual (lol!), but then it was small-town Midwest and they were all white.<br>

		<p>I was driving to get my car washed around 3/pm one day.  I heard a lot of screeching and hollering.  I drove about 5 blocks before I discoverd the source of the noise.  The high school was just getting out and the bus stop and sidewalks were covered with black yout screeching and hollering.</p>
<p>My son is definitely not an academic type.  But he quickly transferred to the magnet school on his high school campus to get away from the incredible noise level of the black kids.  I think there were only about 20 percent black kids in that high school, but they kept the non magnet school so noisy no one else could stand it.</p>

<p>Oh, boy!  Staying at the Sheraton!  No cheap motel for these kids.  Teenagers eating at the hotel bar?   Ordering up meals from room service?   Not eating at the McDonald&rsquo;s down the street? Oh, no   &mdash;    only the best for them!  How do they afford this?  Who pays?  </p>
<p>Btw, I wonder about the condition of those rooms after three days of juvenile occupancy!  It&rsquo;s not hard to guess.  Probably the rugs had to be shampooed and the rooms totally cleaned, if not repainted and refurbished.</p>
<p>I stayed in the Embassy Suites, in Virginia outside Washington, and there was a black family down the hall who had just checked out. I passed their suite  as the maid was in there cleaning and the door was open.  I paused and just had a good look. It looked like a hurricane had hit the place!  There was popcorn and food all over the floor, ground into the rug, the sink was full of bottles, and garbage was strewn everywhere. I pity the poor maid who had to clean up that mess.  How can anybody be so shameless to leave a place in that condition?</p>
<p>And again, I ask:  How do people like that afford it?  No mere room for them,  a suite no less!  (Hint: Isn&rsquo;t Affirmative Action wonderful?)</p>

		<p><b>&ldquo;Get Out Of Here Now&rdquo; </b><br>
Ten police officers banged on his hotel door wielding Taser stun guns at about 1:30 a.m., he said. Hotel staff was there, too.  &ldquo;We want you guys out of here now,&rdquo; they told the drill team, according to Bethea. The cops didn&rsquo;t use the Tasers, but their presence scared the kids, he said.</p>
<p>He asked why the police needed to wake up all the children, including three babies, in the middle of the night. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no justification&rdquo; for that, he said. He asked the hotel to let these kids stay; he would get them out in the morning.  The hotel refused.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Of course the hotel refused.  I don&rsquo;t blame the manager for refusing to let them stay until morning.  That would mean they would have had time to wreck the rooms  (and clean them out too), before leaving. Who knows what damage they could have done?  Management wasn&rsquo;t stupid. They knew that the hotel&rsquo;s only option, upon ordering someone to leave as a last resort (and after giving them  repeated warnings) was to get them out N-O-W. </p>

<p>How true!  As an American tourist currently visiting Sweden, I am impressed at how much the Scandinavians cherish their peace and quiet. Unlike the Latin countries, there is very low tolerance here for noise.   The doors on every hotel that I have been in are thick and massive   &mdash;   more like bank vaults!   And  are very well sound-proofed. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like them in the US.  And the windows are all double-paned and sound-proofed too.  Here you can enjoy heavenly, undisturbed peace.</p>
<p>I wonder how the management in a Swedish hotel would respond to such outrageous, inconsiderate behavior from am unruly group of guests.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s unimaginable here. I&rsquo;m sure they would have very little tolerance for any racket.  But on the other hand, they do have enormous, exaggerated  tolerance for blacks  (who can do no wrong),  so in that case maybe a black group could get away with it.  Swedes would rather die than be accused of &#8220;racism&#8221; (a serious accusation here).   It&rsquo;s an intriguing thought.</p>

		<p>Speaking as one who spent-literally-years living in motels and hotels,I have an observation.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t uncommon for a hotel to offer less frequent housekeeping services to those paying by the week. I&rsquo;ve been in motels for extended periods of time when working away from home,and if I was getting the weekly rate,I almost always got a lower level of housekeeping than would have been the case had I been paying by the day. (Weekly rates,if offered are almost always a lot cheaper than daily rates,but there&rsquo;s almost always a reduced level of housekeeping)</p>
<p>Usually,the weekly rate is about 3 or 4 days of the daily rate. What might-and I emphasize &#8220;might&#8221;-have happened here is that the Sheraton offered this drill team weekly rates,which would make a lot of sense,especially if &#8220;THESE PEOPLE&#8221; were in a competition,and their departure date wasn&rsquo;t set in stone,but was dependent on their scores,and how long they got to keep competing.</p>
<p>Or,the Sheraton,as a goodwill gesture,offered to put &#8220;THESE PEOPLE&#8221; up at the weekly rate,instead of the daily rate. If so,it was a goodwill gesture that was very sadly misguided,but I digress.</p>
<p>So,if some supervisor saw that THESE PEOPLE ( in case anyone hasn&rsquo;t guessed it by now,I&rsquo;m being racist :) ) were being housed at the weekly rate,it&rsquo;s quite possible that it was taken for granted that a reduced level of housekeeping was expected,and acted accordingly.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s what happened,it was-again-a sadly misguided judgment call,because &#8220;THESE PEOPLE&#8221; are never going to be satisfied with anything less than the absolute best,and that best needs to be served up on a silver platter with all the appropriate groveling. And with apologies that it isn&rsquo;t even better.</p>
<p>Might have happened that way,might not have.</p>

		<p>* I find it rather damning that the newscaster in that video mentioned that Mr. Drill Team Instructor admitted that his kids were rowdy and should have been kicked out of previous hotels. Whoopsie! But this one, heavens no. They weren&rsquo;t rowdy at all. You&rsquo;ll just have to trust me.</p>
<p>* The great thing about capitalism is, it tends to keep the peace and fosters cooperation among groups that don&rsquo;t particularly care for each other. Most people will hold their noses and do business with the outsider as long as it&rsquo;s a good deal. How astounding is it that Bantus can still get people to refuse to do business  &mdash;  even in a PC era, even in a sour economy, even at a corporate monolith, even when the managers know that a lawsuit is hanging overhead like the sword of Damocles?</p>
<p>* I used to think that blacks just enjoyed being antisocial and ill-mannered boors. But now I&rsquo;m not so sure. Blacks have been infantilized, coddled, and separated from mainstream culture (via the welfare state and housing projects far from whites) for so long, they honestly don&rsquo;t even know that their behavior is boorish. When they are confronted, they are hurt and confused  &mdash;  it simply doesn&rsquo;t calculate for them.</p>
