<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chef Andrews Cheung&rsquo;s workplace looks, sounds and smells like a typical Chinese kitchen  &mdash;  woks sizzle, fryers crackle and counters are piled high with noodles for chow mein.</p>
<p>But Cheung&rsquo;s kitchen is not in a restaurant. It&rsquo;s in a Brooklyn hospital, and the variety of dishes prepared each day are not for ordinary customers  &mdash;  they are made specially for the patients in Lutheran Medical Center&rsquo;s Chinese Unit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Launched in 2004, the Chinese Unit  &mdash;  a 16-bed wing on the fourth floor  &mdash;  is the only one of its kind in Brooklyn catering specifically to the burgeoning Chinese immigrant population in Sunset Park.</p>
<p>Though the unit is open to patients of all ethnic backgrounds, it only takes a quick whiff of the Chinese cuisine and a glance at the Chinese art and signs on the walls to understand that the unit was created with Chinese patients in mind.</p>
<p>With Chinese-speaking bilingual and bicultural staff on hand 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the unit allows patients who speak little or no English to communicate easily with physicians, nurses, social workers and volunteers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For patients like Leong Chu, 72, and her visiting daughter Jean Wu, 46, the Chinese Unit has been a comfort. &#8220;It&rsquo;s no different than home at all,&#8221; said Wu.<br>

		<p>This is part of the &#8220;universal&#8221; healthcare that the American people want.  A nation of suckers like the U.S. deserves to overrun and destroyed. </p>

		<p>I live in NYC.  This is just another insult to White Americans.  In a hospital not too far from this one - Maimonides Hospital - which is in the heart of an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood - Borough Park, the entire hospital is dedicated to giving Jews more assistance than any other racial, ethnic, or religious group.  Jews are not criticized when they express a desire for ONLY a Jewish doctor, and most of the doctors at this hospital are Jewish.  Can anyone imagine a hospital that catered to White Christians?  I couldn&rsquo;t imagine anything like this in my wildest dreams.  Can you imagine a White Christian only wanting to be treated by a White Christian doctor and verbalizing it to the staff?  The news crews would be on hand demonizing the person as a White racist.  How far is this multicultural insanity going to go, until Whites are completely destroyed as a race?  It appears to me that I must answer my own question here. Yes, it is going to go that far if we let it.  Unfortunately it appears that most of us are letting it do just that.  I can&rsquo;t believe that most Whites don&rsquo;t realize these things.  How deluded can most Whites be?</p>

		<p>The wonders of multiculturalism. Shame on the Lutherans for pandering to the Chinese. Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful that non-English speakers feel at home speaking their own language, eating their own food etc&hellip;&hellip;.so why come to America?</p>
<p>Chinese are another minority not interested in assimilation and contributing to the US economy. They are better off back in China where they can do the same as in this hopeless Lutheran Hospital.</p>

		<p>Go to Alhambra and other hospitals in the east of Los Angeles San Gabriel valley suburbs.  Entire hospitals are staffed by Chinese employees and serve mostly Chinese patients.</p>

		<p>Why does Lutheran Medical Center have a &#8220;Chinese unit?&#8221;  Sounds like segration/apartheid to me.</p>

<p>Most of the answer is simple; Whites are pretty much decided on their relgion or non-religion, while needy, third world types are seen as open for conversion and therefore of more importance.  The Catholic Church does it, the Lutherans and even the fundamentalist churches such as the Baptist and Pentecostals with their missions.  The LDS and everyone else.  I even was confronted with two old Slovenian women in 1998, while living in Slovenia who were JWs and eager to tell me all about it.  The liberal churches preach liberal politics and the conservative ones their politics.  It&rsquo;s all about influence, and money, money, money - hardly anything to do with spirituality or even the actual religion.</p>

		<p>Just wondering. Why is there no racial diversity in employment in places like Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin Donut&rsquo;s, Subway Sandwich Shops and the like. Would no one other than a South Asian be willing to work there or do they only hire South Asian&rsquo;s? It would be great to hear an answer to this question.</p>

		<p>To the &#8220;Great White Observer&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.big business loves the minorities &#8216;cause they can treat them like rubbish and pay them third world wages in the first world. Down here, in Australia I remember as a kid fast food chains would hire local kids and students and provide some pocketmoney but not these days. These pathetic food chains survive through cheap thrid world labor. Having these non-white dimwits in our job market reduces wages, conditions and ultimately our standard of living.</p>
