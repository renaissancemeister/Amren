<h1>Report Again Slams Dominican &#8216;Racism&rsquo;, &#8216;Xenophobia&rsquo; Against Haitians</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>DominicanToday (Santo Domingo), August 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A report released today by the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA) slams Dominicans and the Dominican Government for its alleged racism and xenophobia against its population of Haitian immigrants and descendants of parents from the neighboring country, yet another criticism which will prompt quick and virulent reactions from political leaders and official spokespersons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dominican leadership, reflecting the attitude of the general population, continues to see Haitians as a lesser people and they have attempted, usually in contradiction of applicable law, to thwart Haitian efforts to achieve citizenship,&#8221; states the report &#8216;Stateless in the Dominican Republic&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The report also slams the national elite&rsquo;s &#8220;disdainful contempt&#8221; for allegedly treating the mostly undocumented immigrants as &#8220;parasitic vagabonds.&#8221; &#8220;For the most part, the Dominican overclass expresses disdainful contempt for the Haitian immigrants, regarding them as parasitic vagabonds.&#8221;</p>
<p>However the report reveals the use of clich√©s and misconception repeated in previous barrages aimed at unveiling deeply rooted sentiments of mistrust between the peoples of the neighboring countries, by confusing two common terms in the hemisphere; mestizo, which describes a mix between European and Native Americans, instead of the correct mulatto. &#8220;Haiti turned out to be a state mostly of African slave descent and what would become the Dominican Republic was predominantly a country of mestizo blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>And again repeats the misnomer: &#8220;Dominican Republic remains the only country in Latin America with a large African-Latino population that has no laws that effectively challenge racial conflict between them and its scornful majority mestizo population.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also reveals a lack of thorough research regarding the country&rsquo;s Law on the right to citizenship by the offspring of people regarded as &#8220;in transit&#8221; in a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 2008. &#8220;By Dominican law, any child born in the Dominican Republic, with the exception of children of ambassadors, is entitled to citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The government also feeds indications of xenophobia by accusing the Haitians of triggering violence in the country, making them scapegoats for crime issues on the Dominican side of the island,&#8221; concludes the report published by COHA.<br>

		<p>Certainly gives the lie to the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; pipe dream that race miscegenation will inevitably lead to the disappearance of &#8220;racism,&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t it?  The Dominicans are about as mixed race as one gets in this Hemisphere, but since they have more European genes than the Haitians (who made an effort to massacre all the white people on the island two hundred years ago, and succeeded on their part of the island - no one&rsquo;s seeking &#8220;reparations&#8221; for that, are they?), the Dominicans still look down on Haitians - often hating them with an almost murderous rage in fact.  In this country as well, anyone who pays attention to what real blacks actually think and do (which doesn&rsquo;t include most liberals), knows that the &#8220;whiter and brighter&#8221; a black, the more prestige he or she has in that community.</p>

<p>Anyone who pays attention to real blacks?? Black folks are falling all over each other attempting to outdo each other on being more &#8216;black&rsquo;, light skinned ones especially. Even Harvard professors outdo themselves trying to be more &#8216;real&rsquo; to the cause. It&rsquo;s too bad being black doesn&rsquo;t include being polite to the fuzz.

		<p>Let me get this straight.  The Dominicans are partly descended from indigenous peoples who have lived there since time immemorial.  But the powers that be wish to force them to accept colonization (i.e. replacement) by blacks.  Almost the entire Caribbean is black.  Would it really hurt to leave one or two areas that are NOT dominated by blacks?</p>
<p>Also, does it ever even occur to these busybody leftists that, if practically every ethnicity on Earth is fearful and hateful of blacks - perhaps there is actually a REASON for this sentiment?</p>

		<p>If the Haitians in the DR are being treated so badly, then I know a place where they can go to be free of discrimination:</p>
<p>Haiti.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the same island, too!  Not far to go.</p>

<p>The person you take issue with is right. Within the black commnity, &#8220;light skinded&#8221; blacks are held in higher esteem than their darker bretheren. Having said that, they all try to act as black as possible. A paradox to be sure but real nevertheless. </p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;ve known a few upper class Dominicans, and when not gaming whites in the game of political correctness, they are some of the most racist people on the planet. Many won&rsquo;t openly admit it but they despise black Haitians and look on Haiti&rsquo;s occupation of the Dominican Republic as the worst time in their entire history. They are extremely color conscious and talk among themselves about &ldquo;good hair&rdquo;, &ldquo;mellow complexions&rdquo;, &ldquo;attractive (white) features&rdquo;, etc. </p>

		<p>I took a vacation in the Dominican Republic a few years ago and it&rsquo;s true most of the natives there loathe Haitians. They correctly see Haitians as beggars and criminal ne&rsquo;er-do-wells.</p>
<p>I saw a group of scoolkids teasing each other, each accusing the others of having Haitian parents-the ultimate putdown. I also rode in a cab where every time the Dominican driver saw a street beggar or a reckless driver he would shake his head and mutter &#8220;Haitiano!&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I think virtually all other blacks despise Haitians.  .  2 women in one of my college classes were talking in French.  I asked them if they were from Haiti, mostly because most French speaking blacks in my area are Haitian.</p>
<p>They were horrified.  They were from Cameroon and held Haitians in deepest disdain.</p>

		<p>If I remember correctly, in a AR Classic Article about Haiti, it was the Haitian despot Dessalines who hated not only Caucasians, but also Haiti&rsquo;s mulatto population, and did all he could to destroy both.</p>
<p>Now, the Dominican Republic is being branded &#8220;racist&#8221; and Xenophobic by COHA, a liberal think-tank. Haiti, of course, gets a pass on its racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic&rsquo;s Gross Per Capita Income is $ 5,122, while Haiti&rsquo;s is $ 791, according to Wikipedia. That means for every U.S. dollar a Dominican earns, a Haitian earns 15 cents. How can this be, after 205 years of independence; that Haiti has produced a per capita income of $ 791, easily the lowest in the Western Hemisphere? Haiti and the Dominican Republic both share the island of Hispaniola (from which the term &#8220;Hispanic&rsquo; originates). The Haitian portion of the island has around 98% of its forest land destroyed, due to people using the wood for cooking fuel. The Dominican Republic still has much forest land left.</p>
<p>One more thing: The Dominican Republic gave us Juan Marichal, one of the greatest pitchers in the history of baseball. Haitians give us a disease-infected, poverty-infested people who believe in voodoo and shamans, and are as racist as any other people on Earth.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Zorba, one of our most perceptive posters, IMO, does not inhabit any bizarro world. He sees it exactly as it is. In this very real world,  what people SAY and what they DO are often two different things. Talk is cheap. Although blacks may currently find it fashionable to act the blackest and talk the blackest, the end fact remains that if you look at their private lives, they still seek either to marry white or to marry the lightest  so-called &#8220;black&#8221; they can find.  Their actions belie their words.   </p>
<p>Even Harvard Prof. Gates has a white wife and daughters who could pass for Latins. He also boasts (in Wikipedia) of having his DNA tested and finding that he is himself 50% white.  Just look at almost any ad aimed at blacks for any high-end products like cognac, jewelry, etc. You&rsquo;ll rarely see a real black woman  (black men yes), but plenty of high-yellow babes in gowns and jewels -  the lighter the better.  All feeding the black male&rsquo;s fantasy. I assume those ad agencies have studied their market very carefully  and know exactly what cravings they&rsquo;re appealing to.   </p>
<p>Judging by the ads and by whom they marry, black men don&rsquo;t dream of black women. And NEVER blacker than they are.  Dominicans, being entirely free of Political Correctness and White Guilt, prove it.</p>

<p>That name sounded vaguely familiar, so I did a bit of research. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Trujillo" rel="nofollow">This page</a> tells you all you need to know about Trujillo. Note especially his regime&rsquo;s immigration policies and the &#8220;Parsley Massacre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a satellite picture of the Haitian-Dominican border, and it speaks a thousand words:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/p2fr9l</p>
<p>The brown area on the left which is totally denuded is Haiti. The greener area on the right is the DR. </p>
<p>Having completely destroyed their own land, Haitians are now illegally squatting in Dominican national parks across the border and destroying them, too.</p>
<p>OT, but this just goes to show that economic development is not necessarily bad for the environment, since the DR is substantially more developed than Haiti according to any indicator one looks at. In fact, economic development is probably good for the environment, since economic development leads to affluence, and the more affluent a society is, the more national parkland it can afford to set aside. So the next time you encounter some eco-freak who claims that we all have to go back to living like aboriginals to save the environment, show him a picture of this.<br>

<p>Thanks for that photo. My great fear is that in a few more decades Haiti may become ecologically uninhabitable. We could then see literally eight or nine million blacks set sail for Florida - a Camp of the Saints scenario. When Haiti was a French colony it was prosperous. Blacks seem incapable of doing anything but running a place into the ground, Haiti, Detroit,etc.</p>

<p>In Spain, Dominicans are treated as badly as the illegal African immigrants, and discover that they are much lower on the totem pole than they had first thought.</p>

		<p>The residents of what is now the Dominican Republic invited white settlers into their territory, unlike the Haitians, who invited them to return (after the first slaughter) and then slaughtered those foolishenough to come back.</p>
<p>As a result, the Africans in the Dominican Republic are marginally smarter and more accomplished.  The white folks who rescued the Dominicans eventually bred with the Dominican Africans, lightened their skin and passed on their intelligence.</p>
<p>What the Dominicans are fighting to preserve is their (fractional) white legacy.</p>

		<p>Haitians are  not what  the  Dominicans spoosedly  describe  them as.  On a  strict  per capita  basis  Haiti  has  produced  so  much  more  literature  and  creative  art  than the  Dominican Republic.  And the  music  in the  DR  &mdash;  mainly  of  Haitian  origin.  And what  have  the  race-obsessed  Dominicans  ever  achieved  except  the  exportation of  mainly  African  baseball  players  &mdash;  all  excellent  because of  their  African  genes.</p>
<p>If Haiti  is  economically  unwell  then  partially blame  the  U.S. econmic  quarantine  after  its independence circa 1806, the  U.S. invasion  early  in the  last  century and  the  economic  hegemony  of the  metis class.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s somewhat refreshing to hear non-whites accused of racism. I think I&rsquo;ve finally figured it out. If you&rsquo;re racist against people with skin darker than yours, its racism; if its against someone with lighter skin, its &#8216;the legacy of slavery&rsquo; or some other nonsense. Blacks are unbelievable insecure about their skin tone and its obvious that lighter skinned Blacks are considered more attractive. A black female acquaintance once told me in the most matter-of-fact manner that &#8220;oh I don&rsquo;t date dark skinned men.&#8221; I was astounded. I wanted to ask her if she realized how unbelievably hypocritical it made her but&hellip; can you blame her? Now, of course, I understand this phenomena, &#8220;colorism,&#8221; as just another facet of Black backwardness. </p>

		<p>I see OCCAM has reared its head again. He/she/it&rsquo;s here to tell us that the only reason Haiti is so destitute is because of the occupation by U.S. Marines that lasted roughly the length of Babe Ruth&rsquo;s active baseball career. Of course, OCCAM conveniently ignores the fact that Haiti has had political instability since independence in 1804. OCCAM also forgets Haitians have destroyed and denuded the forests that once covered Haiti. How is the USA or any other nation Earth responsible for that?</p>
<p>Exactly what literature has Haiti produced OCCAM? It has the highest illiteracy rate of any country in the Caribbean, the lowest percentage of children attending school in the Western hemisphere. Heck, Haiti doesn&rsquo;t even issue written arrest warrants for political prisoners. What literature do you speak of?</p>
<p>Or music? Haiti&rsquo;s music is confined to voodoo chants, and beating drums. Maybe, a few hymnals in the Catholic Church. Or are you going to tell us that Haiti invented rock and roll, predating Buddy Holly; with a band called &#8220;Duvalier and the Tontons Macoute&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s not too far from the truth. Duvalier and his thugs known as the Tontons Macoute, would rock their prisoner&rsquo;s heads into the wall, before rolling them off to prison.</p>
<p>OCCAM, be a good entity and do not try to defend the indefensible. Haiti&rsquo;s record since independence is absolutely indefensible, in all areas and fields. </p>

		<p> I think I&rsquo;ve finally figured it out. If you&rsquo;re racist against people with skin darker than yours, its racism; if its against someone with lighter skin, its &lsquo;the legacy of slavery&rsquo; &hellip;</p>
<p><br>
Somewhere I read a neat explanation of it:  <br>
Dominicans are against prejudice and all for tolerance, UP TO their level of darkness;  but are prejudiced against anyone who is darker them themselves.</p>
<p>Like Mexicans and other Hispanics, Dominicans see nothing hypocritical in adhering to two separate standards at once.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If Haiti is economically unwell then partially blame the U.S. econmic quarantine after its independence circa 1806, the U.S. invasion early in the last century and the economic hegemony of the metis class.&#8221;</p>
<p>First we&rsquo;re responsible for leaving them on their own, then we&rsquo;re responsible because we interfered? Is that how it seems to work to the sensitive, highly trained, discerning African mind?</p>
