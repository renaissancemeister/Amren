			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Christian Institute (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), August 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A comic series depicting superheroes based on characteristics of Allah is reportedly on its way to British screens this year.</p>
<p>The cartoons, named The 99 after the characteristics of Allah, were launched in 2006 as a comic book.</p>
<p>Now an animated series is being produced by Endemol, the Dutch company that made the reality TV show, Big Brother.</p>
<p>The creator of The 99 series is Dr Naif al-Mutawa, a former psychologist who explained he wanted to take Islam away from its militant portrayal after the September 11th attacks.</p>
<p>In a letter to his sons, Dr al-Mutawa wrote: &#8220;Khalid, you were born in New York City, shortly after 9/11. I had already made a decision that I needed to find a way to take back Islam from its hostage takers, but I did not known how.</p>
<p>&#8220;The answer was staring me in the face. It was a simple, and as difficult, as the multiplication of 9 by 11: 99.</p>
<p>&#8220;I uncapped my pen to create a concept that could be popular in the East and the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would go back to the very sources from which others took violent and hateful messages and offer messages of tolerance and peace in their place. I would give my heroes a Trojan horse in the form of The 99.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cast of the comic books include Jabbar, a Saudi Arabian Hulk-type figure and Darr the Afflicter, a paraplegic American who can manipulate nerve endings with his mind to trigger pain.</p>
<p>More characters are being revealed as each comic book is released, but there will never be 99 characters because it is forbidden to depict all of Allah&rsquo;s attributes.</p>
<p>Dr al-Mutawa continued: &#8220;I told the writers of the animation that only when Jewish kids think that The 99 characters are Jewish, and Christian kids think they&rsquo;re Christian, and Muslim kids think they&rsquo;re Muslim, and Hindu kids think they&rsquo;re Hindu, that I will consider my vision as having been fully executed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comic book series is illustrated and scripted by former comic book writers and artists whose credits include X-Men, Spider-Man, Superman and Power Rangers.</p>
<p>In 2008, Forbes named The 99 as one of the top 20 global brands &#8220;sweeping the world&#8221;.</p>

						<p>
							<i>London Telegraph, August 20, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Named the 99, as each possesses one of Allah&rsquo;s 99 attributes, the characters include a burka-clad woman named Batina the Hidden and a Saudi Arabian Hulk-type man named Jabbar the Powerful.</p>
<p>They have proved a hit from Morocco to Indonesia and were recently named as one of the top 20 trends sweeping the world by Forbes magazine.</p>
<p>Now they are being brought to British television by Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, with a mission to instill Islamic values in children across all faiths.</p>
<p>Until now, the superhero market has been dominated by the likes of Batman, Spiderman and Superman who have typically limited their crime-fighting abilities to America and the Western world.</p>
<p>They were created by Dr Naif al-Mutawa, a clinical psychologist from Kuwait, who felt Muslim children needed a new set of heroes to look up to, to counter jihadist role models.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hit me that the stories I was hearing were from men who grew up believing that their leader, Saddam, was a hero, a role model  &mdash;  only to one day be tortured by him,&#8221; he told The Times. &#8220;I decided the Arab world needed better role models.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, despite being called the 99, there will never be a full cast of 99 superheroes since it is forbidden to depict all Allah&rsquo;s attributes</p>
<p>Dr al-Mutawa hopes the cartoons will have a universal appeal.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;It is based on attributes such as generosity and mercy. These are not things that Islam has a monopoly over.&#8221;<br>

		<p>A lot of comic book characters have their origins in some kind of social message. I recently watched an interview with X-Men creator Stan Lee and he said he created mutant heros to counter prejudice against people who were different. It&rsquo;s all good but I doubt it will have much of a social impact except to introduce comic books to moslem countries.</p>

<p>Which one of Allah&rsquo;s 99 attributes covers the whole part where if you violate any one of his infinite arbitrary and pointless laws or his followers will throw acid in your face and cut off your hands?  Maybe we can have an Amed the Vindictive or perhaps a Sahid the Sociopath representing that attribute?</p>

		<p>There will be no &#8216;cat-woman&rsquo; in this series for obvious reasons. The usual super-hero figures are not taken seriously by western children or adults as they all know these are fictional comic-book characters and are open to parody and spoofing. Look-alike costume suits are readily available for parties, hen evenings and stag nights when alcohol is consumed and raucous play is involved. Once the muslims launch this idea, their &#8216;heroes&rsquo; will be revered and any attempt to ridicule them or have fun portraying them will be met with howls of protest and cries of islamophobia and accusations about insulting mo&rsquo;d. Endemol, on channel 4 TV in UK, responsible for the &#8216;big brother&rsquo; series where viewers actually tune in to watch pathetic participants snoring in bed, yelling at one-another or visiting the toilet, will have been persuaded to run the &#8216;99&rsquo; series by the head of programming, a muslim. The head of BBC religious programmes is also muslim. The term &#8216;99&rsquo; if well known in UK as it refers to an ice-cream cone with a chocolate flake bar stuck in the top, not exactly something which would readily spring to mind as an ideal weapon to use when fending off baddies. No doubt we White Christians will be barred from ordering this goody by it&rsquo;s traditional name in case it causes offence by mocking their new &#8216;super-heroes&rsquo; who will not be so thick skinned and powerful enough to shield themselves against any perceived slight. A lethal cocktail of ice-cream and chocolate will be far more potent than kryptonite but as there is the opportunity to create 98 heroes (99 being forbidden) I wonder just how many will self-destruct in the time honoured manner which has become well established as a short-cut to heaven in certain circles. All we need now is a team of Crusader Men, and let battle commence!!</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s more than one way to look at this. Yes, it could be a way to brainwash white kids into liking Arabs who want to take over their country. But the effect will be limited by the medium itself. Those who have followed comic book characters like Batman know that they&rsquo;re based on individualism and justice; Western concepts which are almost entirely absent from the Muslim world. So in order for the cartoons to appeal to whites and be commercially successful &#8220;Allah&#8221; will have to be Westernized to a great degree; hopefully enough to blur or shut out the barbarity of pro-Islam propaganda. </p>

		<p>How about Mohammed the Masochistic Mastermind?  Or maybe they can add a female character named Fahima the Fire-Shooter, or Varisha the Virgin.  No, I guess the only women they would add, would be the ones they have to punish because they let their burkah slip.  But, I don&rsquo;t think they would add any females, they seem to only like the company of men.  </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t they do a cartoon about the life of the &#8216;prophet&rsquo; of Islam himself? You know - showing him being a mass murderer, attacking caravans of innocent people with his bunch of bandits and murdering all the men, then raping the women. And a cartoon about his friend giving him his SIX YEAR OLD daughter to &#8216;marry&rsquo;, and the &#8216;prophet&rsquo; raping her when she was only nine years old, and he was fifty four.</p>
<p>There is no &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; or &#8216;peace&rsquo; in Islam, it is in a state of eternal war with the rest of humanity - i.e. the sane people.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Now they are being brought to British television by <b>Endemol</b>, the production company behind Big Brother, with a mission to instill Islamic values in children across all faiths.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Let me reiterate the focal point of the statement, ie,</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&hellip;.. with a mission to <b>instil</b> Islamic values in children of <b>all</b> faiths&#8221;.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t a crystal-clear Statement of Intent, I don&rsquo;t know what is.  It&rsquo;s not difficult to anticipate what would be the outcome were it a television programme production company backing a Christian cartoonist, issuing such an advance Statement of Intent.</p>
<p>I wonder how much by way of backhanders, Endemol is receiving from the oil-rich Islamic world!!!!!</p>
<p>Sorry, to say, but the wholesale insidious Marxist/Islamo fascist agenda of which this example is yet another tentacle aimed at the annihilation of everything white and Western, has got to be terminated abruptly by <b>any and every means necessary</b>, and that includes the <b>all-out</b> use of nuclear warheads as weapons of last resort.</p>

		<p>Well, you all just had to be so close minded and &#8220;racist&#8221; (religion wise, not nationality wise)</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you just give it a break. <br>
&#8220;More characters are being revealed as each comic book is released, but there will never be 99 characters because it is forbidden to depict all of Allah&rsquo;s attributes&#8221;</p>
<p>Why not depicted? because they say it actually &#8220;Impossible&#8221; to depict them in human kind. The As-Maul Husna is 99 words that depict God&rsquo;s Attributes. And some of them are just Impossible to be in a man. If all &#8220;Attributes or Characteristics&#8221; were in  men, God just wouldn&rsquo;t be (cited)&hellip;God, because no man is perfect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allah-Based Cartoons&#8221;<br>
That is not right, it is not &#8220;based&#8221; on Allah, only the name, which is 99, from the As-Maul Husna. The one who made this (actually, not only him) said that, It will not be religion based. They don&rsquo;t make it clear that these So-called Superheroes do prayer, go to church, carry crosses or anything like that.  One of the things he (Dr Naif al-Mutawa, he&rsquo;s a Psychologist!) is trying to do is to make an super hero idol, for little children, that is not in the west. Because (for instance) kids In the middle east, Indonesia (major muslim countries) have no &#8220;super hero&#8221; idol, and are &#8220;stuck&#8221; with Batman, Superman etc. that heavily resides in west culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;hopefully enough to blur or shut out the barbarity of pro-Islam propaganda. &#8220;<br>
&#8220;barbarity&#8221;? prove it</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder what Jihadman will look like? Or Honor killing man? Or Dissatisfied French Youthman? Or Burka woman? (Will they even have female characters?)&#8221; <br>
&#8220;I guess you&rsquo;ll be able to tell this is a Muslim cartoon attempt by the fact that the heroes are all men and all the women wear head rags (schmatas kopfs) and masks to cover their faces. Even kids will figure that one out.&#8221;<br>
1. No they will NOT have those super heroes, bacause of the reason i&rsquo;ve already explained.<br>
2. Yes, They WILL have female characters, and Probably only 1(ONE) female character will use a burka. And it&rsquo;s symbolic with her name, &#8220;The Hidden&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will Mulsim Man enjoy the company of a young arab boy? I mean, that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s actually done, before marriage, in some parts of the contemporary Muslim World, right?&#8221;<br>
1. No, It&rsquo;s not right, Look them up in History Books<br>
2. There is no &#8220;muslim man&#8221;<br>
3. No, He (Dr Naif al-Mutawa) I think will put little romantism, or anything to do with that. Because he is pointing this out to children.</p>
