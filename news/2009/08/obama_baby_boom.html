<h1>Obama Baby Boom: Predicted Surge in Births Goes Bust</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erika Slife, Chicago Tribune, August 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Nov. 4, the hope and happiness seemed boundless for supporters of President-elect Barack Obama, leading some to speculate, with a wink and a nod, that in nine months there would be a virtual Obama baby boom  &mdash;  a celebratory uptick in the national birthrate.</p>
<p>But now, 40 weeks later  &mdash;  the average human gestation period  &mdash;  MSNBC is reporting the prediction has largely been nothing more than, well, false hope. In reality, experts said, a generation is not borne from one night.</p>
<p>In Chicago, ground zero for Obama&rsquo;s election celebration, area hospitals confirm that they have not seen a noticeable surge in births.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though his election apparently did not spawn a generation of Obama babies, the president may be tickled to know he has inspired a generation of baby names.</p>
<p>In 2008, the name Barack set what&rsquo;s believed to be a record for the Social Security Administration&rsquo;s annual Most Popular Baby Names list by skyrocketing more than 10,000 spots on the list, from No. 12,535 in 2007 to No. 2,409 in 2008. And the Social Security Administration predicts the name will even crack the top 1,000 this year.<br>

<p>How utterly laughable; as is typical of the filthy Red press and other Marxstream media mongrelizers in this country, absurdity is held to be reality until the obvious can no longer be ignored. I wonder what these imbecilic ink-pygmies had really hoped for: every white woman of childbearing years throwing themselves into the middle of our streets nude, waving their legs in the air, and screeching for a black male to come implant an Obama in them?</p>
<p>Or maybe, they had simply hoped for an incalculable increase in black male rapes of white women, as an expression of &ldquo;historic change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p> Why in particular did Obama&rsquo;s fans think there&rsquo;d be a big baby boom just because he was elected president? George Bush supporters could have expected the same thing in 2000   &mdash;   except they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p> Any new president&rsquo;s backers could say, &#8220;This is the dawning of the new millennium!&#8221; but that doesn&rsquo;t make it so. Did the Obamiacs view him as the Second Coming of Mohammed? Were the lion and the lamb going to lie down peacefully together because the Mulatto Messiah had been elected? Foolish, foolish people!</p>

		<p>On a related note - every time I hear someone say &#8220;President Barack Obama&#8221; I die a little inside! I don&rsquo;t think many have even yet considered just the symbolism of a US president with such an alien name! We never had a President Friedrich  Shlappenbach&hellip;or Antonio Benelli&hellip;or Kristian Svenson&hellip;or Phillipe Le Pen&hellip;or Pietor Myruski&hellip;or&hellip;you get the point. </p>
<p>It just speaks volumes about how far America has fallen and how swiftly.  </p>

Why would someone have predicted this particular Obama Effect? Were they making a connection between black men and out of control sexual impulses?</p>

		<p>What!? You mean the birth rate has not magically gone up just because &#8220;the nation&rsquo;s first black president&#8221; has been elected? </p>
<p>I thought women were going to become orgasmic in the streets! Babies would be popping out spontaneously! All the world&rsquo;s economic problems would be solved! Troops would be withdrawn from Iraq immediately! All race problems would be a thing of the past! Blacks would suddenly be achieving on an economic parity exactly consistent with whites! No black student would drop out of school again! Illegal drug use would suddenly come to a halt! Black-on-black crime would plummet overnight!  International relations would enter a new period of harmoniousness as the rest of the world realized what swell people we must be for electing a &#8220;black&#8221; president with a foreign-sounding name! Obama would be working other miracles too, such as raising the dead and walking on water! What about all that &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221; we were hearing about?</p>
<p>In reality, the birth rate has actually gone down due to the recession. None of the other aforementioned miracles have come to pass either&hellip;</p>

		<p>Just wait until October for mulatto babies named Barack&hellip;</p>
<p>Believe me or not but I see every day more and more black/mulatto faces everywhere (TV, streets, workplace).</p>
<p>How long will/can Obamania last?</p>

		<p>At least Barack is much easier for all the gubment employees working at the food stamp and welfare offices to spell than Quarntaevious Rashawan and L&rsquo;tanique L&rsquo;Shae (honest-to-God names recently in our local paper).</p>

		<p>I thought these kinds of mini-baby booms came during a natural disaster when folks had to stay home, or during riots like what happened in New York in 1965 and 1977.</p>
<p>Of course there may have been a lot of frolicking going on last election night, but the collapsing economy may have kept the abortion clinics busy (the growth industry of the Obama presidency?), so there was no net increase. Just a few thoughts.</p>
