<h1>Family Seeks U.S. Asylum After Fleeing Gang</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Miriam Jordan, Wall Street Journal, August 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Threats from a street gang forced Pablo, Rene and Silvia Mira to flee to the U.S. in 2004 from their native El Salvador.</p>
<p>Now, the question is whether the government will consider resistance to joining gangs as grounds for asylum, and let them stay.</p>
<p>The U.S. government generally hasn&rsquo;t viewed people fleeing gang pressure as candidates for asylum. Those granted such status traditionally have been fleeing oppressive political regimes or have been members of religious or ethnic minorities facing persecution.</p>
<p>But after an emergency appeal to block the Miras&rsquo; deportation landed before the Supreme Court last month, the Department of Homeland Security decided to reconsider the case of the Mira family. The Miras could help set a legal precedent that determines whether people fleeing gang violence qualify for asylum.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the Miras argue that youth who resist gang membership for personal, moral and religious principles constitute a &#8220;particular social group&#8221; that faces reprisals.</p>
<p>A DHS spokesman said the government is &#8220;developing regulations to better define grounds for asylum.&#8221; The new guidelines could end up changing how these kinds of cases are decided.</p>
<p>There is no official data on the number of court cases that involve claims for asylum by people who say they came to the U.S. to escape gang recruitment. But asylum scholars estimate that in the past decade thousands of Central American youth have fled gang violence and claimed that returning home would endanger their lives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Heather MacDonald, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, who studies gangs, cautioned that &#8220;creating another category for asylum will increase the number of people coming into the U.S. to seek asylum. It would be hard to adjudicate these factual claims.&#8221;</p>

		<p>So where do Americans whose lives are in danger because they don&rsquo;t join a gang get to go for asylum?</p>
<p>Prediction:  If these three from El Salvador get asylum, they will procreate in America, and their children will be gang bangers.</p>
<p>It should be noted that one-fifth of all El Salvadorians on Earth live in the United States.</p>

		<p>Of course the USA will let them come on in and stay&hellip;we have got to be the dumbest people on earth! There will be gangs saying they are threatened by opposing gangs and they will get into America. They will ALL lie and claim they are victims when in reality they are more than likely liars and frauds. This is just another means to dumb down the asylum status as they have been doing for decades now to allow anyone and everyone into our country.. When will White America wake up? </p>

		<p>El Salvadorians are geniuses when it comes to concocting &#8220;asylum&#8221; reasons to immigrate to the US. Let them clean up their rotten, stinking country. They have imported their violent gang culture to the US. None of them should be allowed in the US. Most of the millions of Salvadorians should be deported as they lack legal papers or came here under false pretenses of &#8220;persectution&#8221;. These people are clannish, are communists, and will never assimilate to Anglo Saxon values. They are destroying the Washington DC suburbs of Maryland and Virginia.</p>

		<p>RHG&hellip;.not only do we have more goodies to hand out, the countries you mentioned will not take them. Only the traitors in D.C. have accepted these foreigners to the detriment of White America and have been doing so for 40 years or longer. They KNOW what they are doing and do so willingly and DELIBERATELY. It is the White sheeple who will not wake up to the fact that they are being replaced and for a reason they cannot fathom.</p>
