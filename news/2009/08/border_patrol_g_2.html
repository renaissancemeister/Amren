<h1>Border Patrol Goes High Tech</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Photonics (Pittsfield, Massachusetts), August 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year, DHS has accelerated plans to build a &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; on the US-Mexico border that will incorporate steel towers equipped with infrared sensors, remotely operated cameras, communications devices and radar. The system is designed to aid border patrol agents in identifying and intercepting 70 to 85 percent of all illegal passages into the US, increasing control over an immense and rugged terrain.</p>
<p>&#8220;US Customs and Border Protection&rsquo;s approach to securing the border relies on an appropriate and effective balance of personnel, technology and tactical infrastructure, which includes border fencing, roads and lighting,&#8221; said Mark Borkowski, executive director of the initiative. &#8220;The integrated SBInet technology allows CBP agents and officers to efficiently detect, identify, classify, track and resolve illegal incursions,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Permanent tower structures standing a few hundred feet apart will be equipped with a Flir Systems Inc. HRC medium-wavelength infrared camera, an Hitachi visible-wavelength electro-optical camera, an advanced radar surveillance system and a laser rangefinder mounted on a high-speed pan/tilt unit. Placed around the towers will be receivers for unattended ground sensors and a microwave system that transmits data back to a command center.</p>
<p>The sophisticated system also will offer enhanced target recognition during day, night and limited-visibility operations, while advanced zoom capabilities will allow detection from hundreds of feet to more than a mile away, Borkowski said.</p>
<p>DHS and its chief contractor, Boeing, are in the beginning stages of modeling the security system along 53 miles of the Arizona border. According to DHS, the fenced area, called block 1, will consist of two sections: Tucson-1, which will cover 23 miles of the border, and Ajo-1, which will cover the other 30 miles.</p>
<p>Once the government approves the setup, the remaining 320 miles also will be equipped with the technology, followed by New Mexico, California and most of Texas  &mdash;  excluding approximately 200 miles that runs along the extremely rugged Big Bend National Park. It is intended that the entire US-Mexico border will be outfitted with the system by 2014.</p>
<p>Over the course of the initiative, Boeing has received $600 million for technology, and as of a year ago, had received an additional $260 million for construction. Total expenditures for the virtual fence are estimated to reach $6.7 billion by 2014.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The microwave systems, along with more compatible cameras and the technology&rsquo;s chief component, called a common operating picture (COP), have made the surveillance system easier for border patrollers to use.</p>

		<p>We can waive to them when they come in.  The whole point of a virtual fence is that it is easily reversable.  Without the manpower to aprehend those crossing it will do nothing.  </p>
<p>If we put up a double row fence with concertina wire like a maximum security prison with anti-car trenches on either side then we would not need a lot of border patrol agents or many fancy sensors.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t our border agents say the problem is not detection but a lack of manpower and the DANGEROUS restraints put on them when they do try to apprehend? Smugglers of illegals and drugs know to send a decoy so the agents have to guess at which one they should go after. Millions of dollars wasted. But I supposed it really is not supposed to work anyway.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; is simply a method to transfer large amounts of tax Dollars to the military-supply companies that are based in the states of congressmen or who donate large amounts of money to certain congressmen.  </p>
<p>If virtual fences actually worked, then they would tear down the physical fences surrounding the White House and the factories of these companies, and replace them with &#8220;virtual fences.&#8221;  The fact that Obama prefers to keep a simple physical fence around his house suggests that even Obama realizes that real fences work and &#8220;virtual fences&#8221; don&rsquo;t.  Note that Obama would never risk the safety of his family to a &#8220;virtual fence,&#8221; but is more than happy to risk your family&rsquo;s safety to one.  Hypocrite!  Elitist! </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s all this for?  To show us that people are sneaking in to the U.S. from Mexico?  Well, duh, I would have never guessed.</p>
<p>All those cameras in London and Chicago are really doing a good job preventing violent crime.</p>

		<p>We have one of these huge water-filled ditches all around Britain which is quite wide, being 21 miles across at it&rsquo;s narrowest. It&rsquo;s also tidal with lots of dangerous currents and fleets of huge ships which would prove hazardous to most amateurish attempts to cross. We don&rsquo;t have any virtual equipment to keep out aliens and illegal immigrants but we do have a virtual government who do virtually nothing to keep out such people. They even issue asylum papers to those still in Europe and who haven&rsquo;t yet reached our shores although this is in breach of the international asylum laws. It is rumoured that those who do manage to enter UK live in a virtual UK world as avatars because they are never seen again and there is no record of them ever leaving. Why they never leave is a bit of a mystery as many hate out guts and even emerge now and again into the real world to march around waving placards threatening us with decapitation and an afterlife in hell. Our laws prevent us from suggesting that since they find us so distasteful they should simply return from whence they came and although they can run around saying they are going to kill us, our virtual government says this behaviour is only traditional and a harmless part of their culture so we must not object under pain of imprisonment for racism. So our big ditch which stopped the King of Spain, Napoleon and the Nazis who all wanted to subjugate us has been rendered virtually useless by the diktats of our own government. When I see the astronomical sums of money the USA is proposing to spend to seal your southern border, I cannot help but compare it to the cost we already pay in UK to provide housing, health care, schooling and cash benefits to our own immigrants. At least you have lots of spare space for yours compared to the UK which is actually full but virtually empty if our government is to be believed. Good luck with the razor wire, we are not allowed to use it because of Health &amp; Safety regulations, most of which originate from Europe, but that&rsquo;s another story!     </p>

		<p>In the 40 years that East Germany existed, only a handful of people managed to cross their borders. They did not have the technology, the night vision equipment and all the fancy gadgets we have today, all the had was the will. Without the will to stop illegal immigration - at the very top of the chain of command - the border will remain as porous as a sieve.</p>

		<p>I was on the Arizona border last year with the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps.</p>
<p>We were, in essence, a &#8220;virtural fence.&#8221;  We sat in lawn chairs approximately 1/10th mile apart with radios, night vision &amp; sound detection gear.  We called MM Base which called BP every time we had a contact.</p>
<p>BP caught a very, very small portion of those we reported.  The desert is big &amp; dark, and you can miss someone hunkered down in the shadows 25 yds away.  BP has limited equipment and relies mostly on old-fashioned tracking   &mdash;   at one point, they asked to borrow our IF-vision tower to find a group of illegals they had lost.</p>
<p>One night, a group of 7 illegals literally stumbled into our position in the dark.  Despite 2 BP agents being on the line with us, and despite a chopper that arrived in less than 5 minutes, illegals got away.</p>
<p>Virtual fence is a joke.  For $6.7 billion, you could hire hundreds of thousands of Minutemen and the results would be no worse.  <br>

		<p>&#8220;Border Patrol goes &#8220;High Tech&#8221;(quotation marks mine)</p>
<p>The &#8220;high tech&#8221; part made me remember something about the American Space Program and the so-called benefits it created. I relate it to the idea of a simple border fence, to a high tech form of security. </p>
<p>NASA, had companies working to develop a &#8220;high tech&#8221; writing pen to counteract gravity. It was accomplished,finally, after millions of dollars were invested. The Russians had the same problem  &mdash;  and solved it by, using a pencil. CASE CLOSED FOR HIGH TECH BORDER FENCE IDEAS, AT LEAST FOR MY WAY OF THINKING. </p>

&ldquo;The &ldquo;virtual fence&rdquo; is simply a method to transfer large amounts of tax Dollars to the military-supply companies that are based in the states of congressmen or who donate large amounts of money to certain congressmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hey, the virtual fence is the best for all involved.  US citizens will believe that finally something is being done.  The Mexican government, always thin skinned, will not be insulted by a real fence that works.  What&rsquo;s more, the illegals will still come over &ldquo;virtually&rdquo; unencumbered.  <br>
 <br>
To cap it off, the environmental nut jobs will be satisfied that the delicate environment will not be disturbed by a physical fence.  Environmental destruction is a job for illegals.  Last be not least as Anonymous 6:37 wrote, defense contractors and those tied into the cyclopic DHS hierarchy will become fat. <br>
   <br>
With all this done, politicians can clear the way for amnesty since the border problem has been solved.  This will allow DHS to work on the real problem, abolish 2nd amendment because of its interference with peace and tranquility of Mexico.   <br>
