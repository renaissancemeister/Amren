<h1>What Killed Detroit?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Frum, National Post, August 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What killed Detroit?</p>
<p>The collapse of the automobile industry seems the obvious answer. But is it a sufficient answer? The departure of meatpacking did not kill Chicago. Pittsburgh has staggered forward from the demise of steelmaking. New York has lost one industry after another: shipping, garment-manufacture, printing, and how many more?</p>
<p>Two other factors have to be considered.</p>
<p>The first is the especially and maybe uniquely poisonous quality of Detroit&rsquo;s race relations. Like Chicago, Detroit attracted hundreds of thousands of black migrants between 1915 and 1960, mostly very unskilled, hoping to gain well-paying employment in factories and warehouses.</p>
<p>Their arrival jeopardized the ambitions of the white working class to raise its wages through unionization. Henry Ford eagerly hired black workers in order to defeat the unions, and in the violent labor clashes of the 1930s, whites and blacks often confronted each other as strikers and strikebreakers.</p>
<p>After the war, the United Autoworkers union tried to integrate blacks into the industrial workforce. But by then automation had begun, and industry&rsquo;s demand for unskilled labor would first cease to grow, then diminish, then disappear. For many migrants, the promised land soon proved a mirage. Or maybe worse than a mirage. If the promised land did not yield the hoped-for industrial jobs, it offered something else: generous new welfare programs, the ashy false fruit of urban liberalism. The children of the parents who accepted the fruit grew into the criminals who drove first the middle class and then the working class out of the downtown and then altogether out of the city.</p>
<p>As the white working class departed, Detroit became a black-majority city, governed by a deeply aggrieved and flagrantly corrupt political class. Political dysfunction spiraled the city into another cycle of dissolution and abandonment  &mdash;  and the abandonment in turn provided the politicians with fresh grievances.</p>
<p>The second factor in Detroit&rsquo;s decline is the city&rsquo;s defiant rejection of education and the arts. Pittsburgh has Carnegie-Mellon. Cleveland has Case Western Reserve University. Chicago has the University of Chicago, Northwestern, and a campus of the University of Illinois. Detroit has .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wayne State.</p>
<p>A city that celebrated industrial culture spurned high culture. The Detroit Institute of Arts is very nice. But it does not begin to compare to Cleveland&rsquo;s museum, let alone the Art Institute of Chicago. Detroit has a symphony orchestra, but its history has been troubled and unstoried in comparison to Philadelphia&rsquo;s or Cleveland&rsquo;s. On the plaza in front of the Detroit municipal building is a huge bronze replica of Joe Louis&rsquo; fist and arm, as if to say: &#8220;Here is a city ruled by brawn.&#8221; Brawn counts for very little in the modern world. The earnest redevelopers who hoped to renew Detroit by razing its history instead destroyed the raw materials out of which urban renaissance has come to so so many other American downtowns. {snip}</p>
<p>Detroit confirms the lessons taught by Jane Jacobs and Russell Kirk. Preservation is as vital to urban health as renovation. Indeed, they are inseparable. The preservation of the old incubates the new.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The second factor in Detroit&rsquo;s decline is the city&rsquo;s defiant rejection of education and the arts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or as a less &ldquo;thoughtful&rdquo; individual might put it Comrade Frum, this city occupied by wretchedly feral African hybrids, has deteriorated into one where even the cornerstones of an acceptably marginal civilization are totally nonexistent. Truculent ignorance is what has replaced education, and art is only to be found in a postmodern context of the most lethal and depraved sort. </p>
<p>However, with all that considered, it is really the contemptibly pitiful weakness and cowardice of whites, that is the real problem in this black urban nightmare of the daylight. Since 1967, there has been an endlessly sanctimonious chatter about &ldquo;reconciliation,&rdquo; while suburbanization has kept reality surreptitiously behind 8-Mile. It is an essay in surrealism, that cannot fully be explained to an outsider; only living there, can fully elucidate the problem.</p>
<p>That problem should have been solved in 1967 with merciless resolve by the decent white population of the city. Every year that has passed since that date, continuously demonstrates that the same still holds true, but with only ever more urgency!</p>
<p>What more to say, other than, God help us all!!! </p>

<p>Amazingly, there was not one mention of the 1967 riots as a possible factor of what killed off Detroit!</p>
<p>Whites didn&rsquo;t move out because they didn&rsquo;t like or didn&rsquo;t appreciate new black neighbors moving into their previously safe and comfortable neighborhoods.  There wasn&rsquo;t any white flight. There never has been any white flight anywhere.  The truth is ethnic cleansing, in this case more like racial cleansing.  Whites were driven out.  The Detroit 1967 riots, which blacks actually celebrate as a &#8220;rebellion,&#8221; were the last straw for the remaining large numbers of whites in the city.  They salvaged what they could of their property, grabbed their kids, and left   &mdash;   driven out, not peacefully fleeing by any stretch of the imagination.  After the riots, it just got worse,  and the situation spiraled downward.</p>
<p>The idea that the city declined because it didn&rsquo;t invest in the arts is simply laughable. If I ever encounter the authors of that bilge, I&rsquo;ll laugh at them, in their face, because that&rsquo;s all they deserve. They do not deserve to be taken seriously.<br/>

		<p>I love the way the PC media bends over backwards to find &#8220;reasons&#8221; why cities like Detroit failed. The collapse of the automobile industry. The lack of a good museum. Blah blah blah. Detroit failed because it&rsquo;s populated by and controlled by blacks. That&rsquo;s the reason and that&rsquo;s all you need to know about it.</p>

		<p>I grew up in Detroit, being a observant teenager during the late 1950&rsquo;s and early 1960&rsquo;s, I saw the seeds of Detroit&rsquo;s destruction being sown.<br/>
First, the racial &#8220;blockbusting&#8221; that was prevalent in stable all-white neighborhoods by greedy real estate agents was a factor.  They would &#8220;help&#8221; a black family move in and then send postcards to all the neighbors stating &#8220;a new family has moved into your neighborhood.  If you wish to sell your house, please contact me at xxx-xxxx&#8221;.<br/>
Second, the 1967 &#8220;riots&#8221; destroyed much of the neighborhood businesses and accelerated &#8220;white flight&#8221; to the suburbs.<br/>
Third, the election of &#8220;mayor&#8221; coleman a. young alienated EVERY remaining white resident.  His racism poisoned &#8220;race relations&#8221; to this day.<br/>
Fourth, the collusion between real estate speculators and HUD (federal Housing and Urban Development) with the &#8220;urban renewal&#8221; programs destroyed most of the good housing stock in Detroit.  HUD would buy up the best houses on each block and raze them while ignoring the substandard housing.  Property values were depressed (which was the idea) which continues to this day.<br/>
In Detroit, it is possible to buy a house for $300.00 (yes $300 dollars).</p>

<p>Maybe the car plants in Detroit closed because of black crime, not the other way around.  GM&rsquo;s Corvette plant was in north St. Louis City until the early 1970s.  They closed it b/c of black crime.  GM moved Corvette mfg. to Bowling Green, Ky., and they also built a new plant for GM vans in Wentzville, Mo. in the St. Louis area for the GM workers.  Wentzville was exurban at the time, it&rsquo;s a solid suburb now.  Unfortunately, some of the black workers at GM in north St. Louis were transferred to Wentzville, and that has left Wentzville with a mini-ghetto.  Just about all serious crimes in Wentzville are done by blacks.</p>

		<p>Liberals always blame the &#8220;collapse of the auto industry&#8221; as the reason Detroit went under. The truth is that the auto industry wasn&rsquo;t doing badly until just the last several years, Detroit has been a dump for at least the last 30 years. Blacks and their &#8220;culture&#8221; caused the decline of that once grand city and many more since then. Everyone knows that but are too afraid of being called a &#8216;racissss&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>You omitted an interesting passage from the original:</p>
<p>&#8216;A couple of days after I returned from Detroit, I telephoned a friend who had lived and worked in the city for many years. My friend, it&rsquo;s relevant to mention, is the son of an Irish cop, ardently Catholic and defiantly conservative. Why did Chicago recover and Detroit fail, I asked. What doomed the city? He thought for a moment. &ldquo;Not enough gays.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>For culture to survive, it needs white people. For culture to thrive, it needs gay white people.</p>
<p>I wonder what AmRen readers think of that?</p>

		<p>&#8220;What killed Detroit?&#8221;,,,,,,</p>
<p>The exact same thing that killed Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Kingston, Jamaica, the rest of the Caribbean and every sub-Saharan city in Africa - a majority black population. Is there ANY black city (or country) in the world that is peaceful, prosperous, culturally dynamic, with arts, museums, low crime rates and a high quality of life? I think not! Why would this Port-au-Prince on the Great lakes be any different from any other black place? Think of all the truly great cities of the world; Paris, Vienna, Rome, Tokyo, etc.. Do any majority black cities come to mind? Look how ruined cities like Berlin or Tokyo or Hiroshima were rebuilt and are fine places today. The key fact is that the people who inhabited those cities were Germans and Japanese and not Africans. Detroit is simply more proof that the wealth of cities lies in the people who inhabit them and the social and human capital they possess (or not). </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s almost laughable how the author dances around the real reason for Detroit&rsquo;s demise, but still misses it. There are none so blind as those who will not see.</p>
<p><i>The collapse of the automobile industry seems the obvious answer. But is it a sufficient answer?</i></p>
<p>And just how many industries do blacks create, besides crime and drugs?</p>
<p><i>The children of the parents who accepted the fruit grew into the criminals</i></p>
<p>And what percentage of the criminals were white?</p>
<p><i>The second factor in Detroit&rsquo;s decline is the city&rsquo;s defiant rejection of education and the arts.</i></p>
<p>And what all-black area does not reject the arts? As far as the black mentality goes, the highest of the fine arts is rap and the output of Michael Jackson.</p>
<p><i>A city that celebrated industrial culture spurned high culture.</i></p>
<p>Read the above.</p>
<p><i>On the plaza in front of the Detroit municipal building is a huge bronze replica of Joe Louis&rsquo; fist and arm, as if to say: &ldquo;Here is a city ruled by brawn.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>No!! Don&rsquo;t you see it?! It says, &#8220;Here is a city ruled by blacks!&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the whole problem. But a mind in chains will never see it.</p>

		<p>This was an intelligent and thoughtful article, but i take issue with the last point the author brings up. I don&rsquo;t think that the lack of museums and high culture was the final nail in Detroit&rsquo;s coffin. Detroit&rsquo;s problem is Detroit&rsquo;s population. If they wanted business, tourism and culture they would have them. What they have is what they have created for themselves. </p>

		<p>While the author only gently touched on Detroit&rsquo;s racial problems, he did so in the context that it was insufficient unionization of the Bantu autoworkers. As prior posters have mentioned, no word on the 1967 and 1968 riots. Nothing about Coleman Young&rsquo;s racism. He does say the city rejected education, but never says who or why. We at Amren know the answer, don&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>What killed East St. Louis, IL?</p>
<p>What killed Camden, NJ?</p>
<p>What killed Johannesburg, New South Africa?</p>
<p>What killed Timbuktu, Mali?</p>
<p>What killed Port au Prince, Haiti?</p>
<p>What killed Gary, IN</p>
<p>Or maybe, it should be WHO killed Detroit, and the other aforementioned cities.? We know the answer to that one too.</p>

Perhaps there is an analogy to canaries or budgies in mines, they are very susceptible to CO and pass out when the concentration rises to a dangerous level. Black thugs often target effeminate homosexuals, the ones that &#8220;adore preservation&#8221;. These will leave when the area becomes too dangerous for them They probably abandoned Detroit decades ago; while Chicago is still sage enough for them. <br/>
This may be an example of confusing correlation with cause, a common phenomenon in Liberal and NeoCon intellectual bloviators. </p>

<p>If this is as good as your arithmetic gets, you can blame them for destroying your education.  </p>
<p>Except in four mostly small states, the oldest &#8220;boomers&#8221; did not get the vote until 1967. Therefore the greatest damage had already been done by earlier generations  &mdash;   those &#8220;greatest&#8221; ones!</p>

		<p>Maybe I have missed it, but as an ex Detroiter, I have never seen in print what the devisive first black Mayor of Detroit, Coleman Young said when he took office.  He said to whites, &#8220;This is a black run town now, if you don&rsquo;t like it move north of 8 mile.&#8221;, 8 mile being the road that divides Detroit from the northern suburbs. Just how is this any  less offensive than the old stories about signs that supposedly said &#8220;Black man get out of town by sunset&#8221;</p>

		<p>This comment is for A.Deck. You have it backwards. I am a boomer. I grew up in an all white neighborhood. The first time I went to school with blacks was in high school. None were in my classes but that&rsquo;s because there were 4 of them. Out of 1200. And 2 in my graduating class of 350. I don&rsquo;t associate with blacks, don&rsquo;t have any black friends, and have no reservations about confronting blacks over inappropriate behavior. The problem you want to pin on &#8220;boomers&#8221; is really the fault of your generation and your children&rsquo;s. GenXers are the &#8220;enlightened&#8221; people that mix with blacks, emulate the rappers, and embrace the &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; lifestyle. Your generation produced the &#8220;whiggers&#8221;. When I was a child and young adult emulating blacks would bring scorn and rejection. You wouldn&rsquo;t be seen as hip, but a fool. It is your generation that glorifies black &#8220;gangstas&#8221; My children were always insulated from blacks. My youngest son was home schooled when the final deterioration of our public schools took place through integrating blacks by forced busing. It is the youth vote, the white youth vote, as well as young urban liberal whites that put the Joker in the White House. It wasn&rsquo;t my generation. I would agree that the blame for Detroit and the rest of America heading for third world status is partly the baby boomer generation&rsquo;s fault. But a significant share of the blame goes to your generation. Is your comment a case of the pot calling the kettle black?  </p>

<p>Your argument is based on the assumption that the boomers could have stopped all this if they&rsquo;d wanted to  &mdash;  that they somehow &#8220;let&#8221; the politicians wreck your children&rsquo;s futures. Personally, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case. Most of these changes were rammed down our throats at bayonet point by the Federal government. Bussing, for instance. There was widespread and sometimes violent opposition to integration at the time and it didn&rsquo;t make a bit of difference in the long run.<br/>

		<p>To Archibald who writes:</p>
<p>&gt;&#8221;For culture to survive, it needs white people. For culture to thrive, it needs gay white &gt;people.</p>
<p>&gt;I wonder what AmRen readers think of that?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think:</p>
<p>I support American Renaissance&rsquo;s policy not to bash gays and to encourage responsible gay people to work for the legitimate rights of our people/culture in their own way - different strokes for different folks, let&rsquo;s hope some White gays are going to emerge and go a different way and help our people.</p>
<p>I note that the greatest Dutch leader in modern times was Pym Fortuyn - the gay/bi political leader who took the brave and true stance that Dutch/European freedoms, including freedoms for homosexuals were greatly threatened by Mass Muslim immigration - who&rsquo;s culture was not &#8220;tolerant&#8221; to say the least.</p>
<p>I was looking for some American White gays to emerge and fight the horrible anti White, Cultural Marxist Federal Hate Crime Bill - that makes Blacks, Latinos, Muslims and Gays as official PC victim groups entitled to special prosecutors, special programs, endless entitlements to advance the interests of these victim groups at the expense of regular White Americans.</p>
<p>CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG, BUT I SAW NO OPPOSITION TO THIS HORRIBLE ANTI WHITE CULTURAL MARXIST HATE CRIMES BILL FROM ANY WHITE AMERICAN GAY ORGANIZATION OR EVEN ONE GAY PUBLIC FIGURE.</p>
<p>The American homosexual community seems perfectly happy to be part of the anti White PC Lib/Min alliance and put out the lie that American history is the history of oppression by White straight Gentiles against Blacks, Native Americans, women and everyone else and gays will enjoy great happiness as long as their are open borders immigration from the third world and America tolerates, embraces all non Western cultures including radical Islam.</p>
<p>To all White gays who read American Renaissance and post here, I say it is time for you to&hellip;</p>
<p>PUT UP OR SHUT UP!</p>
<p><br/>
Pym Fortuyn definitely &#8220;Put up&#8221; and he fought and and gave his life for our people. That is why he was voted the greatest Dutch leader of all time.  </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t say I see any American homosexuals, gays who are doing much of anything for our side in the good old USA.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always said that our biggest and most powerful enemies look just like us.  I&rsquo;m a baby boomer and I&rsquo;ve never voted liberal in my life; however, I was brainwashed to some degree.  I always had pride in my ethnicity (Irish, Italian) and pride in my race.  Both will never waiver but my race is paramount to anything else in my life, right up there with my immediate family.  But, I&rsquo;ve also come to realize that this governing body cannot be saved as it is.  It is our biggest enemy and it is far too big and too far gone.  The enemy of &#8220;us&#8221; has taken over.  And, it&rsquo;s already starting to implode.</p>
<p>All racially-conscious whites need to start communicating locally amongst themselves.  I strongly believe that the worst is yet to come and the worst is far, far worse than any of us can imagine.  We cannot defend ourselves single-handedly.</p>

		<p>a.deck you certainly aren&rsquo;t very well read ar you. If you want to blame the &#8220;boomers&#8221; then you have to factor in giving birth to and having to care for dysfunctional children like yourself. The current state of events in America today can be traced back to the liberal Kennedy &amp; Johnson administrations. Read a little about these two presidents and become enlightened instead of blaming your parents since they were only kids themselves during that era. And you ain&rsquo;t seen nothing yet since our current president just getting warmed up.</p>

		<p>Well, it was an interesting if misleading article. </p>
<p>I would like to add to the list of lacunae in the article by mentioning <a href="/ar/1991/08.html" rel="nofollow">Devil&rsquo;s Night</a>. Nowhere did the author discuss the delightful local custom of randomly setting fire to buildings and houses on the nights preceding Halloween. I myself would have found this practice unnerving, even if the author of this piece did not.</p>
<p>Also, I have to disagree with the author about Detroit not being capable of undergoing a renaissance. It actually is undergoing a renaissance at present, even if the author is unwilling to recognize it; it is reverting to urban prairie.</p>

&gt; Just to set the record straight, it was the so-called &#8220;Greatest Generation&#8221; that allowed the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 get passed.  It was also they who allowed, radical integration laws to be enacted, etc.  I was 13 in 1965 and the older boys were mostly drafted and serving in and around the Viet Nam conflict.  I recall my U.S. History class in 1968; We were already having Black History Month shoved down our throats, etc.  Similarly, Feminism was a for of brainwashing that came from older, bitter women and injected into young, active minds.  I recall how difficult it was to find a woman who wasn&rsquo;t messed up some way with Feminsism.  But they really had no idea why they were mouthing this stuff, other than it was popular and made some sense on the surface.  The situation today is now hard wired into our society and culture.  </p>
<p>Becasue of these and other factors, IMO, the Boomer Generation got used, abused and then neglected while our parents got piles of rewards, cut taxes for education, and otherwise made sure thatw their retirements would be cushy.  It is the Boomers who are facing a broken Social Security System and other faling programs that our parents - and the politician they elected, cleaned out and managed irresponsibly.  It is THEY who allowed international corporations to benefit from any sort of immigration to fight unions, etc.  It was they who allowed in Affirmative Action.  We had to deal with it.  I have been a victim of reverse racism since I was 19; That&rsquo;s since 1971.</p>
<p>I have picked up on the Gen Xers, Ys, and others blame game on Boomers.  It is ignorant nonsense that bubbles up from a generation of over-protected, over coddled whiners who never faced things like a draft or a meat-grinder like Viet Nam.  The Gen Xers are the ones who have brought us this cyber scam culture we live in and the zero ethics business and political culture of today.  If I were you, I would learn some social history and look at bit closer in the mirror.<br/>

		<p>The black takeover was enough to kill it, of course. But even if Detroit had remained mostly white, the auto industry would have been killed by the UAW, over regulation and &#8220;affirmative action&#8221;. British industry went straight into the toilet following WWII long before they had any appreciable number of non-whites. It reminds me of a line from Python:</p>

		<p>Archibald  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m laughing! I&rsquo;m gay and for all our faults, gay guys really do keep things &#8220;nice.&#8221; I was listening to the John and Ken show out of LA a few months ago, and some woman came on who explained how hard it was to be a landlord in LA. The conversation was noteworthy for two reasons. One, she said her tenants were usually bad news, behaving like &#8220;white trash,&#8221; destroying the place and not paying their bills etc. Then she clarified that her tenants we not white!! I was astonished that she would use what is apparently the last acceptable racial slur to describe behavior when whites weren&rsquo;t even involved! The California brain-washing was complete!</p>
<p>Then John asked this landlord woman what the solution was  &mdash;  you know, how do you find good tenants. She spoke right up, and said, once again to my astonishment, without even giving it a moment&rsquo;s thought  &mdash;  &#8220;Follow the gays.&#8221; She explained that we were clean, took care of the property, and rarely caused her any trouble. She said we were the &#8220;perfect tenants.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see that straight people are starting to see the truth about us. That was about the first time I ever heard anybody say anything good about gay people, unsolicited. I appreciated it.</p>

		<p>Hey, Mike, I was little when Coleman Young got elected mayor of Detroit, and I remember my mother complaining about it.  I remember my parents saying things like &#8220;he needs to worry about his OWN side of Eight Mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember there was a big stink when it was decided that Young&rsquo;s name should be painted on the Detroit Zoo water tower.  The zoo is in Huntington Woods, but when I lived in Ferndale, in the 80s, the zoo was technically part of the City of Detroit.  They went ahead with it and painted &#8220;Coleman A. Young, Mayor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course they had to repaint it when Dennis Archer got in.</p>
<p>In 1992, when that Rodney King thing broke out, we were a bit concerned about possible rioting, as we lived only a few blocks north of Eight Mile.  My dad was saying, &#8220;So long as they keep it on their side of Eight Mile&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

What killed Detroit,or what killed America? My parents are in their late fifties, I love them very dearly. But They are of the generation that let politicians and PC destroy my childrens&rsquo; futures. </p>
<p>Thanks for nothing boomers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the oldest boomers.  I agree with everything A eck wrote.  It was our generation that destroyed America.  But we had a lot of help and indoctrination from our parents, the depression generation.</p>
<p>This is how boomers were raised:  If our parents were lower middle class, working class, Catholics, Jews, Southerners or &#8220;intellectual&#8221;workers or teachers, we were taught to worship at the Cathederal of Saints Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>
<p>American colleges were pretty much taken over by communists in the thirties and they have kept their hold on academia ever since.</p>
<p>The boomers are at fault, but we were pretty much raised by lefty school teachers and professors.<br/>

		<p>I think white homosexuals can be the next great WN/RR demographic.  The reason is that they tend to prefer big cities, which also tend to be heavily black.  And the black hypocrites that engage in &#8220;down low&#8221; behavior will turn right around and assault white homosexuals, using anti-gay slur words in the process.  </p>

		<p>You know,here&rsquo;s a rather hair brained scheme. I haven&rsquo;t thought it all the way out,and I&rsquo;d need some more information before thinking it all the way out is even possible,but I&rsquo;ll throw it out here as food for thought,if nothing else.</p>
<p>Item: Detroit is on the verge of imploding,in the relatively near future. What that future will hold is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p>
<p>Item: The United States as we knew it is long gone,and it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me all that much if what&rsquo;s left of it implodes fairly quickly. (Unthinkable? Maybe. How many middle aged people reading this thought they&rsquo;d ever see the Berlin Wall torn down and scattered?)</p>
<p>Item: You can buy a house in Detroit for next to nothing. Not much of a house,and I have no idea what the taxes and other fees would run,but still-property there right now is cheap.</p>
<p>Item: Detroit wasn&rsquo;t always a hellhole. Once upon a time-and not that long ago,it was a very good place for the likes of us. It had good infrastructure,it had good schools,it had strong neighborhoods,it had jobs that allowed a high standard of living for ordinary people,it had all kinds of the things that make life worth living.</p>
<p>It could be that way again. The place has potential. And if some people like us were to quietly start buying up the vacant lots,it might be a place to start fresh after the dust all clears.</p>
<p>Yes I know it&rsquo;s pure speculation,but those prices just got me to wondering.</p>
<p>Anyone have anything to add?</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve often wondered about what destroys a city or a nation. For America, I think it&rsquo;s guilt. After WW II America was the most powerful country in the world, Japan, China, all of Europe and most of the rest of the world was left in total ruin. Americans looked at this and wondered: My God, what have we done? The guilt was passed down to the next generations and the rest of the world has played to that guilt like a well trained violinist plays the violin. Now, the world is so accustomed to this guilt that it&rsquo;s become a given. This gave rise to political correctness which the government has now mandated be practiced like a religion.<br/>
 As for Detroit, the blacks drove out the whites with the full backing of the Federal Government through the reasoning of political correctness.(The same thing has been happening in South Africa, but I digress).</p>

		<p>I was a child in the 60s and have a vivid memory of the network news one night reporting the passage of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.  The news commentator and camera focused on some Southern Congressmen who were standing and talking amongst themselves.  They looked deeply anguished.  The narrator said they were opposed to the Act. </p>
<p>So, young Amren readers, please know that not everyone in America in the 60s was in favor of changing our country in radical ways.  The Americans then who opposed the Act were told that our country would not be overwhelmed by the Third World, that our country&rsquo;s demographics and culture would remain the same, and that they were being illogical for worrying.</p>

<p>RIGHT! then, as now, our politicians did not and do not care much what we voting American taxpaying slaves want, only their own interests interested them. It is also of note, that those politicians that initiated this immigration mess are STILL IN OFFICE!!! Time to change things and Weapons are our friends. Like Kennedy said &#8216;make peaceful revolution impossible, then they make violent revolution inevitable&rsquo;</p>
