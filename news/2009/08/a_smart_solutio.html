<h1>A Smart Solution to the Diversity Dilemma</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Richwine, The American, August 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Science is telling us that ethnic diversity causes significant problems by diminishing valuable social capital. What then should we do about it?</p>
<p>It was not the kind of message a Harvard seminar expects to hear. Ethnic diversity causes a lot of problems, our guest speaker told us. It reduces interpersonal trust, civic engagement, and charitable giving. It causes us to disengage from society, like turtles shrinking into their shells, reducing our overall quality of life. The more diversity we experience in our lives, the less happy we are.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The guest speaker who came to discuss diversity was political scientist Robert Putnam, who is something of a celebrity in academic circles. With the publication of his 1995 article &#8220;Bowling Alone,&#8221; Putnam helped bring the issues of social trust and civic participation to the forefront of social science. His article became a popular book, also called Bowling Alone, in 2000. Written for a general audience, the book chronicled the rapid decline in civic engagement that had taken place in the United States since 1950, and argued that communities without strong social ties are less happy and less successful. The article and the book garnered Putnam numerous media appearances and spawned reams of response articles in academia.</p>
<p>So how did Putnam come to conclude that ethnic diversity is so problematic? The answer begins with the notion of &#8220;social capital,&#8221; which Putnam defines in simple terms  &mdash;  &#8220;social networks and the associated norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness.&#8221; Social capital turns out to be an exceptionally valuable commodity. Building complex networks of friends and associates, trusting others to keep their word, and maintaining social norms and expectations all grease the wheels of business by enabling cooperation.</p>
<p>But the value of social capital goes well beyond economics. Many of the activities from which people draw the most deep and lasting satisfactions are stronger and more prevalent in areas with high social capital. People living in these places tend to have more friends, care more about their community, and participate more in civic causes. Where social capital is greater, Putnam says, &#8220;children grow up healthier, safer, and better educated; people live longer, happier lives; and democracy and the economy work better.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When he spoke to my class in 2004, Putnam had started to analyze the survey data, but he had not yet published any findings. He began by telling us about one result he encountered that was thoroughly upsetting to him  &mdash;  the more ethnically diverse a community is, the less social capital it possesses. When a person lives in a diverse community, he trusts everyone less, including those of his own ethnic group. In describing the behavior of people in diverse areas, Putnam told us to imagine turtles hiding in their shells.</p>
<p>Putnam walked us through how he came to his conclusion. At first, it was just a simple correlation. Looking at his list of the most trusting places, Putnam found whole states such as New Hampshire and Montana, rural areas in West Virginia and East Tennessee, and cities such as Bismarck, North Dakota and Fremont, Michigan. Among the least trusting places were the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Houston. The most trusting places tended to be homogenously white, while the least trusting places were highly diverse.</p>
<p>Putnam told us he had been fairly certain the correlation would go away once other factors were taken into account. But it didn&rsquo;t. He entered a long list of control variables into regression analyses that predict elements of social capital such as neighborly trust and civic participation. Many factors  &mdash;  especially younger age, less education, and higher poverty and crime rates  &mdash;  seem to damage community relations. But none of these factors could explain the robust, negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social capital. Sounding almost defeated, Putnam told us that ethnic diversity is not merely correlated with certain community problems  &mdash;  it causes them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Putnam {snip} finally publish some of his findings in a 2007 article. Though he began the article with some questionable reassurances that diversity offers long-run benefits, he pulled no punches in regard to its many &#8220;short-run&#8221; costs. He warned in particular that immigration makes the United States and Europe more diverse every year, and that incorporating immigrants into our communities would be one of the central challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Consider how surprising this is. Achieving diversity, especially ethnic diversity, is an explicit goal of virtually all major corporations, universities, and government agencies. The U.S. Supreme Court has declared that diversity is a &#8220;compelling state interest&#8221; that overrides legal prohibitions on race-based school admissions. Top politicians routinely utter some version of the phrase &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; in speeches. Our immigration policy even features a &#8220;diversity lottery&#8221; that randomly offers green cards to foreign nationals whose primary qualification is that they come from exotic countries. Two years after Putnam wrote publicly about diversity&rsquo;s problems, and at least five years since he has been presenting his findings informally, nothing has changed. We still treat diversity as an unqualified good.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} If immigrants could possess certain characteristics that tend to increase social capital, then the impact of ethnic diversity could be at least partially mitigated.</p>
<p>I intend to focus on one such important characteristic  &mdash;  how smart the immigrants are. Intuitively, it is not a stretch to believe that smarter people are better at organizing networks and understanding the long-term benefits of cooperation, and a burgeoning academic literature confirms that intuition. IQ, a construct that psychologists use to estimate general intelligence, has been separately linked to elements of social capital, such as sophisticated ethical thinking, altruism, planning for the future, political awareness, adherence to informal community standards of behavior, and cooperation for the greater good. Despite this research, the direct link between intelligence and social capital has been drawn only in a handful of technical articles. It is time to bring the IQ-social capital link out of the academic journals and into the policy debate. Doing so could help us deal realistically with the problems Putnam has identified.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>The social attitudes of citizens are the building blocks of social capital, and IQ plays a role in shaping many of them. For example, psychologists have developed measures of moral reasoning that overlap substantially with IQ. When confronted with a moral dilemma, a person operating at the lowest level of moral reasoning would consider only his own self-interest. As moral reasoning becomes more sophisticated, people tend to give more consideration to community welfare, and to apply abstract principles to resolve moral dilemmas. Because of the cognitive demands of such reasoning, smarter people are much more likely to transcend simple self-interest in their ethical thinking. People who do so are likely to be better neighbors and better citizens.</p>
<p>Intelligent people are also likely to be more altruistic, which could help form tighter bonds within communities. In one recent study, researchers presented a group of undergraduates with a series of situations in which they get one amount of money and a stranger gets another amount. Then they had the undergraduates rank their order of preference for each situation as the amounts of money change. Altruistic people were defined as those who preferred less money for themselves in order for a stranger to receive a higher amount. The most altruistic people scored nearly 8 points higher on an IQ test than the least altruistic people.</p>
<p>Another trait important for maintaining social networks is the willingness to plan for the future rather than live for the moment. Last year, two Yale psychologists systematically reviewed the best studies of the relationship between IQ and &#8220;delay discounting,&#8221; which means acting impulsively. The typical experiments surveyed by the authors involved a series of hypothetical offers of cash (or some other reward) made to participants with known IQ scores. Each offer would consist of a lesser reward in the present versus a larger reward at some future date. The authors of the survey concluded that higher IQ people are almost always found to be less impulsive.</p>
<p>It makes intuitive sense that smarter people should be able to internalize future rewards more easily. They are probably more future-oriented because they can better manipulate their surroundings, whereas incompetent people exert less control on their future, making it murky and unknown. Whatever the cause, the impulsivity of low-IQ people has serious implications for social capital. People in less intelligent populations will be less willing to set up networks for potential long-term payoffs, make personal investments in the community, and follow basic norms of behavior with the expectation of future reciprocity.</p>
<p>We have seen that smarter people tend to be more ethically sophisticated, altruistic, and future-oriented. All of these traits are theoretically useful for creating social capital, but are smart people actually better citizens and neighbors in practice? For real-world evidence, we should turn first to civic participation, a major component of social capital. Various survey data indicate that IQ is an important and independent predictor of voting, membership in various social organizations, daily newspaper reading, and tolerance of free speech rights. It is clear that smarter people tend to value and participate in the political process more.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the behavioral measures the authors [of <cite>The Bell Curve,</cite> Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray] examined was something they called the middle-class values (MCV) test. People pass the MCV test if they do all of the following  &mdash;  graduate from high school, avoid jail, stay married to a first spouse, maintain employment, and wait until marriage to have children. There are no formal laws against illegitimacy, divorce, or idleness, but there is a stigma against these behaviors among middle-class people. People who pass the MCV test are obeying social norms whose strength depends not on law enforcement but on social capital. They are following an implicit social contract. In Herrnstein and Murray&rsquo;s words, middle-class values reflect &#8220;ways of behaving that produce social cohesion and order.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In summary, higher IQ people appear to be more morally sophisticated, altruistic, and forward-looking. They exhibit higher levels of civic participation, more strongly adhere to middle-class behavioral standards, and cooperate more readily. This evidence, taken as a whole, confirms that intelligence and social capital are strongly related.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Some clear policy implications follow. What we want are immigrants who are most likely to be cooperative, trustworthy, and concerned about the welfare of the community. No one has any simple, reliable way of ascertaining whether an individual possesses these qualities. But we do have a simple, reliable way of measuring another quality that is correlated with them  &mdash;  cognitive ability, as measured by an IQ test or an educational credential. The smarter our immigrants are, the more likely they are to trust and cooperate, and the less likely they are to subtract from our existing stock of social capital. Selecting immigrants for intelligence (or a proxy indicator like education) could lessen the negative impact of ethnic diversity on American society.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Skill selection is a desirable way of addressing the problem of ethnic diversity because it is already a policy option on the table. More intelligent (or educated) immigrants would be more productive workers, and they would also have a much less objectionable social impact on the United States due to their enhanced ability to cooperate. Putnam&rsquo;s concerns about deteriorating social capital form another argument for immigrant skill selection.</p>

<p>Translation:  More white immigrants.  And I agree, except that white countries outside of South Africa and Zimbabwe don&rsquo;t have any whites to give, for the most part.</p>
<p>Incidentally, two rare good uses of the H-1B program have both been white and Scandinavian:  One is Linus Torvalds, who needs no introduction.  The other is &#8220;DVD&#8221; Jon Lech Johanssen, &#8220;DVD Jon,&#8221; who was brought over here from Norway by MP3.com founder and tech businessman Michael Robertson, purportedly to work on the now defunct Linspire Linux distribution, but Robertson admitted that it was more political than anything   &mdash;   he wanted to save DVD Jon from Norway&rsquo;s copywrong extremists and fanatics, the RIAAs and MPAAs who are essentially arguing for horses in a railroad and automobile world.</p>

		<p>These same folks claim that IQ is not genetic or hereditary. Almost everyone claims that. I suppose hesitating too long before agreeing to that/knucking under could raise aspersions to Nazism or evil.</p>
<p>So by their own sensible logic, limiting immigration to high IQ persons will offer no long term benefits. </p>

		<p>I absolutely can&rsquo;t believe what this article is saying! I thought diversity was our greatest strength??!!! That&rsquo;s what I was told in the public schools and later by my college professors and I keep hearing it from the mass media. And this Richwine guy claims that higher IQ people are better citizens and neighbors than those with low IQs?! I thought intelligence was a meaningless social constuct that had no bearing on success in life. And even if it did, I thought IQ tests were culturally biased against certain minority groups and that IQ was influenced soley by the environment?! I thought we weren&rsquo;t suppose to care if low IQ scoring immigrants flooded the country because most of their kids would become college educated proffesionals because Bush&rsquo;s ingenious No child Left Behind program would magically make them into little Einsteins?!</p>

		<p>Svigor: you took the words straight out of my mouth. The problem of low intelligence among ethnic minority populations should be treated as a SYMPTOM of non-white immigration; we should not make intelligence a criterion in deciding who to admit. Those of us who value the common ancestry, beauty and virility of our race - and indeed other races - should view the notion of IQ-based immigration with utmost distrust. As you have said, the more intelligent and culturally assimilable the immigrant population, the greater the genetic threat they pose to us.</p>
<p>I understand that this may strike some as cold language; but I geniunely believe that our people must maintain a certain exclusivity if we are to retain our integrity. If we make IQ the central criterion of our immigration policy, based on perceived social assimilability and optimum &#8216;civic participation&rsquo;, are we not just a nation of &#8216;social scientists&rsquo; and accountants?</p>

		<p>I read Bowling Alone about a year ago and paid particular attention to what Putnam wrote in regards to social capital.</p>
<p>He provided a social capital index map of the United States in one of the chapters which showed which states ranked highest and those which ranked near the bottom.</p>
<p>Results: The New England States and Upper Midwest Great Lake states ranked highest and the Southeast and Southwestern states the lowest. The western states were somewhere in between. Even though each state recieved an individual ranking, the results surely highlighted regional differences.</p>
<p>Conclusion: There is definitely a coorelation between white homogenity, affluentness and high social capital. The map speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Now look whats happening to Westchester County New York that AmRen adressed the other day. </p>
<p>White communities, high in social capital are now being forced to subsidize their own dispossetion by marketing affordable housing to non- whites! Civically engaged, responsibe and productive citizens of these wealthy suburbs must now &#8220;un-do&#8221; all that they tried to preserve.</p>
<p>But the real insanity to this story lies in the fact that certain whites in power like Obama&rsquo;s HUD Secretary, Shaun Donovan are forcing other whites from the same socio-economic backround to destroy their own communities. He has publically stated that he intends to carry out the administrations mission to dismantale white suburbia by forcing them to become inclusive.</p>
<p>This blows my mind. This guy Donovan was born in New York State and educated at Harvard. According to his bio, he&rsquo;s a total by-product of white suburbia and all that high social capital that goes along with it! Where did this twisted form of self- induced white flagillation come from? </p>
<p>God help us all,- please</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons why this movement of white preservation will not work. This all or nothing mentality. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you see that this in-between step is a heck of a lot better than what we currently have? Don&rsquo;t you understand that this simple method of allowing in high IQ peoples will virtually eliminate Mexican/hispanic, Arab, and Black immigration? </p>
<p>Yes, it would allow in Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans, but it&rsquo;s the lesser of two evils. Yes there would be miscengenation, but again it&rsquo;s the lesser of two evils (think black-white baby, mexican-white baby, or japanese-white baby. which would be more crime-prone? which would probably just barely finish high school? which would be more likely to go to and finish graduate school with a masters?) </p>
<p>This screening for IQ thing isn&rsquo;t a perfect solution. But it&rsquo;s pointed in the right direction. </p>
<p>Rejection of this and maintaining that all or nothing thinking amounts to doing nothing. </p>

		<p>This is where liberals run into trouble. Liberalism is not possible without science and objective knowledge. Historically the scientific revolution in Europe preceded liberalism. So here we have a scientific study showing diversity is bad. Liberals have been great champions of diversity so what do they do with this new scientific knowledge? They ignore it and continue forward with their diversity push. How do liberals decided when and when not to change their actions based on science?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The most trusting places tended to be homogenously (sic) white, while the least trusting places were highly diverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is another way to look at it. The most trusting places tend to be homogeneously White, and the least trusting places tend to be the least White. I haven&rsquo;t read Bowling Alone yet (I&rsquo;ll be getting a copy from the library soon), but I&rsquo;d be curious if Putnam surveyed or studied Detroit or any other city or area with a large majority black population. And if he did, what did he find? I&rsquo;d be willing to bet he found that the less White an area is, the less social capital it had. Probably doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with &#8220;diversity&#8221; per se, but the percentage of the population that&rsquo;s White. Of course, he&rsquo;d never admit that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the time up to the early 60&rsquo;s was so idyllic and is looked upon so fondly by many people. It was much more White than today, and had much more social capital nationwide.</p>

		<p>Only admitting people with high IQs would certainly be better than our current immigration policy.  But it would have disparate impact so would be unacceptable.  Our politicians favorite people, Mestizos and blacks, would hardly ever get to immigrate.<br/>

		<p>I think the solution would be to not allow immigrants other than Whites, into the US. No Hispanics, no Asians, no Arabs and definitely no Blacks.</p>
<p>The US need to work against the threat of becoming something that might look like a Third World country. It&rsquo;s not just about IQ, it is also very mucha bout values and the different kinds of civilisation, that different races can create.</p>
<p>I mean, it is possible that the average IQ in Viet-Nam is reasonably high, but for nothig in the world I would want to live there! </p>
<p>The more people from alien cultures are present in the West, the more they seek to reproduce their alien way of life over here&hellip;</p>

		<p>The subtext of the article seems to imply that lack of diversity in ANY ethnic increases social capital. While I may agree that this may apply to white, Chinese, Japanese, and some other ethnic communities, it seems to me that for some other ethnic groups the reverse holds, and I notice that while the tone of the article may imply it holds for all ethnic groups, all the examples seem to be white. </p>

		<p>I agree with him. However I have read Bowling Alone and the biggest lesson I came away with is Diversity in general breeds social isolation, not simply low intelligence. For example, Singapore, home to a population of majority Han Chinese has laws limiting freedom of speech while Hong Kong does not. Why? Because Singapore is also home to  Indians and Muslim Malays.  Can&rsquo;t criticize religion. Secondly, I believe social science is on our side. Studies done on interracial marriage show divorcee is much more likely. </p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the strong heterogamy hypothesis, AB marriages will have a divorce risk that is higher than the maximum divorce risk of AA and BB marriages. For example, we expect that a marriage between a Catholic and an unaffiliated person will have a divorce risk that is higher than the (already) high risk for unaffiliated couples. According to the weak heterogamy hypothesis, AB marriages will have a divorce risk that is higher than the average risk of AA and BB marriages…</p>
<p>Combinations of Dutch and Turkish or Moroccan persons reveal a stronger heterogamy effect than combinations involving Dutch and Western European persons. The effects for combinations involving Southern Europeans are in between the combinations with Turks or Moroccans and the combinations with Western Europeans….</p>
<p>Our analyses confirm the hypothesis for marriages that cross the Protestant-Catholic or the Jewish-Gentile boundary. Heterogamy effects are weaker for marriages involving Protestants or unaffiliated persons. Marriages between Dutch and other nationalities have a higher risk of divorce, the more so the greater the cultural differences between the two groups….&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richwine is correct in arguing that IQ is paramount to predicting dysfunction. I would imagine a white male-Chinese female couple to have a much calmer marriage than that between intercity blacks. Although, Charles Murray in The Bell Curve had written marriages are usually between similar IQ persons. Wouldn&rsquo;t a Catholic and unaffiliated spouse probably be matched for IQ? But again, after reading Bowling Alone I am less convinced of the merits of bringing in more immigration. IQ seems to be getting more head-way-immigration advocates&rsquo; version of damage control I guess. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine, so long as they are smart.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think people are quite ready to admit Diversity is a sham. </p>
<p>//<br/>
I listened to Jared Taylor give a talk at CoCC on what Science tells us about diversity. I suggest to everyone to click on &ldquo;Archives&rdquo; and listen to Taylor &ldquo;June 26: Council of Conservative Citizens Conference.&rdquo; Very illuminating.  </p>

		<p>If the Homeland Security Dept proposed to Congress that IQ be the primary or even a primary standard for immigration, the media, ethnic interest groups, and the liberal network would shoot the idea down within seven days or less. </p>
<p>The TV talk shows would outdo themselves with &#8220;pundits&#8221; sticking their noses down to new depths as they smirk at the idea of IQ based immigration.<br/>
Of course no critic would have read more than a paragraph if that of the evidence in support of this sensible idea. </p>
<p>Indeed, the only reason for immigration at all is to enhance the workforce and/or IQ level of the existing population.</p>

		<p>This is just another attempt to maintain or increase asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION. High IQ LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians have already harmed thousands of Naitive Born White American families.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans will do very well if the post-1965 LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians weren&rsquo;t in America. In fact since the arrival of LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians, the economic status of Native Born White Americans has taken a deep decline. Race-replacement and economic harm go hand in hand. </p>
<p>What this writer is bascially saying is this:We can still have diversity-reace-replacement-it will just be shiftef to towards the asians variety.</p>
<p>How did Native Born White Americans manage to survive when the asians weren&rsquo;t in America? Very well thank you.</p>
<p>Someone should tell Roy Beck that immigrants are in fact responsible for the continuation of post-1965 immigration policy. Blame the immigrants. Send your $$$$ to American Renssaince,not numbersusa.com. White Nationalism is the only game in time for Native Born White Americans.</p>

Our people are our people, and they would still be my people and deserve my loyalty even if they were the biggest failures and the most notorious idiots on Earth.  While it is true that accepting higher IQ non-whites would help the United States in terms of IQ average, the fact still remains that they are not our people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Results: The New England States and Upper Midwest Great Lake states ranked highest and the Southeast and Southwestern states the lowest. The western states were somewhere in between. Even though each state recieved an individual ranking, the results surely highlighted regional differences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing that, GNW.  I am a Southerner who is proud of my heritage but I most certainly don&rsquo;t mind acknowledging these cold facts.  First of all, the South has more minorities than the NE etc&hellip;.  This is the most obvious reason for IQ differences, social standing differences, and many other differences between the regions as well.</p>
<p>Second of all, even when you compare strictly Southern WHITES only to Northern WHITES only, you see the same patterns.  The South was settled by the  Scottish and Irish from the original colonies, while the more stately city-oriented English stayed up North.  And it could even be argued that the Scandinavians and Germans who settled the North later had higher IQs than the white population living in the South at the time.  I don&rsquo;t see this as a slam against my people simply because it is only the truth.</p>
<p>But what gets me and sickens me as a Southerner is how the liberal Northern elites take these facts and run with them and have a grand time abusing the Southern white male based on a distorted and ignorant analysis of why these facts are what they are to begin with.  </p>
<p>When you go on internet forums and chat rooms and discuss these issues with the general American public, the overall consensus seems to be that &#8220;&hellip;blacks, hispanics, and other minorities, when given the chance, can be equal to the white man.  Shame on Southern whites for mistreating them&hellip;.yada yada&hellip;.&#8221;.</p>
<p>When discussing the WHITE Southerner, on the other hand, they talk about us as if God took the mold from the bottom of a swamp and created us out of it.  We are an inferior and helpless species of humans. Anything negative about the South is attributed to us.  Anything positive about the South (good football teams, music, food etc&hellip;) is attributed to blacks.</p>
<p>It disgusts me how Northern liberal whites will happily group themselves in with blacks and minorities and go on and on about how they &#8220;are all equally intelligent and they are all in this fight together&#8221;.  Meanwhile the Southern white male is the exception to the rule.  He is genetically inferior and he is the enemy.  </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that, while different, the Northern white elite has far more in common with the Southern backwoods white redneck than he ever will with any minority group.</p>
<p>Northern liberal whites make me sick! </p>

		<p>Untrustworthy people with high IQ&rsquo;s are still untrustworthy (e.g. Wen Ho Lee).  The sense of community, trust, and civic engagement that&rsquo;s borne of cultural and ethnic cohesion were &#8220;public goods&#8221; in majority White countries pre-1965.  However, since the Quisling politicians, Marxist educational institutions, and money-grubbing media/corporations have virtually erased our borders and nationhood, the aforementioned goods can only be had if you have the money to fork over for your gated community and country club membership. The rest of us plebes have to suffer the slings and arrows of being racist for trying to pursue self-determination by a means other than money.  For White people, community is now a private good for which you must pay, otherwise, you&rsquo;re a racist.</p>

<p>Think Jupiter, THINK. If an attempt like this actually makes some sort of headway, (ie.-we use IQ as the primary qualification for admitting immigrants), yes, legal east-asian immigration would be maintained or would increase, but Black, Hispanic, Arab, south Asian, and Pacific Islander immigration would dramatically decrease, or in some cases disappear. </p>
<p>The Mexican/Hispanic tide would be stopped. The Haitian/African migration would be halted. No more Tongans and Hmong. </p>
<p>I understand that a &#8216;white only&rsquo; policy is in the long run the one that works best for American society. But if we maintain this stubborn &#8216;all or nothing&rsquo; attitude, we&rsquo;ll never get there.</p>
<p>Telling liberal America to let in &#8216;whites only&rsquo; has a far less chance of working than telling the liberals to let in &#8216;high IQs only&rsquo;. The high IQ argument, especially how it relates to economic drain, is very compelling during this age of economic decline. The high IQ argument relates immigration to people&rsquo;s pocketbooks and wallets. That makes sense to them. </p>
<p>The &#8216;whites only&rsquo; argument still reeks of WW2 war crimes and will be stopped before it ever gains any momentum. </p>
<p>We must have priorities. The biggest risks to America today are blacks and hispanics, by far. They cause our streets to burn, our stores to be looted, and our schools to be enstupified. They are our first obstacle. The second would be the Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make first things first. </p>

<p>What you are claiming is that middle-class white Americans will be happy to welcome high IQ Asians, who will compete with them directly for the rapidly declining middle-class jobs in the US. Does the scenario you describe really make sense? Why would middle-class whites support an immigration policy that would deny job opportunities to them and their children? HIB Visas for Asians have turned even middle-class white liberals against white collar immigration.</p>
<p>As for the rich liberals, they are more likely to support low-IQ immigration of hispanics, so that they can pay their nannies and garderners less. It is these rich elitist liberals who are more likely to shout-down advocates of high-IQ immigration as &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>America was a great country before we started to receive Asian immigrants. America does not need Asians. If Asians are so great, why do they need to immigrate here? We did not need Asians in putting a man on the moon, or in splitting the atom. They should stay in India, Phillippines, and China.</p>

<p>Fact is, according to Dr. Richard Lynn in IQ AND THE WEALTH OF NATIONS,<br/>
 <br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations</a> </p>
<p>Ireland has an average IQ of 93. If what you&rsquo;re saying is correct, that the South has much Irish immigration, and the north Germanic immigration, then it pencils out that the northern whites will be intellectually higher to southern whites. </p>
<p>According to Dr. Richard Lynn: </p>
<p>Average IQ of Ireland = 93 (southern whites)<br/>
Average IQ of Germany and Netherlands = 102 (northern whites)</p>
<p>Northern Germanic whites on average, it would appear, are intellectually superior to southern Irish whites. That&rsquo;s a 9 point IQ difference. </p>
<p>To put it into perspective:</p>
<p>American Blacks            = 85 Average IQ<br/>
Southern Whites (Irish)    = 93 Average IQ<br/>
 8 point IQ difference. </p>
<p>Southern whites (Irish)    = 93 Average IQ<br/>
Northern whites (germanic) = 102 Average IQ<br/>
 9 point IQ difference. </p>
<p>Strictly speaking in terms of IQ points, southern whites are closer to American blacks in intelligence (not behavior) than they are to norther whites. <br/>

<p>If you are insufficiently aware of racial reality, let me enlighten you: it&rsquo;s the fact of multiracialism that will lead to white racial extinction, not the IQs of the people whites miscegenate with; a separation formula must be found.  </p>
<p>It is possible you are desperate and clutching at straws, any straws within reach, in order to promote a position you believe the majority of whites will go along with.  High-IQ immigration may succeed in shifting thinking (unlikely, I believe) but it can only be a temporary measure.</p>
<p>It is also possible you are mendacious.  Perhaps you have an Asian girlfriend or &#8220;high IQ&#8221; mixed offspring.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, whatever the case, for people with an interest in racial (and cultural   &mdash;   high IQ immigrants hardly behave like whites culturally) preservation, you are worse than useless.</p>

<p>This might have been true very,very early in America&rsquo;s history, say the 1600&rsquo;s to early 1700&rsquo;s but not later on. Numerous Irish as well as Italian immigrants settled up North, just look at Boston, it&rsquo;s an Irish town. There was a lot of southern European immigration to the North but little in the South. Furthermore, the Germans and Scandinavians mostly settled in the upper Midwest, mainly Minnesota and Wisconsin but not in the Northeast. There were also many English that settled in the old South. <br/>

<p>The Irish have produced great physcisists,mathematicians and engineers. Among the ranks of todays elite physcists the Irish are well represented.</p>
<p>Southern Whie Males have been and continue to be well representd in the space program at all levels.</p>
<p>So we now know that the miscegentor Realist supports asian LEGAL IMMIGRATON beccuase he thinks they are more intelligent than Americans of Celtic ancestry.</p>
<p>Importing asian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS is not better choice than importing hispanic immigrants unless yiou think importing a large population of high fertility asian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS who will be working very hard to destroy centuries of Native Born White Engineering expereince-future experience included. This is in the realm of genocide.</p>
<p>Native Born White Amerians were much better off when the asians when the asians were not in OUR AMERICA.</p>
<p>Quoting Rushton&rsquo;s numbers about Celtic peoples intelligence is obviously worthless information.</p>
<p>Now if you know what the Quaternions are and what is a  Hamiltonian, take a look at the ethnicity of the scientists behind it. And if yo ever heard of BEll&rsquo;s inequality, take a look at the ethnicity of the scientist who came up with it. Then there is Fields Medal-the Nobel prize for mathematics-winner Curtic McMullen,Harvard professor of Mathematics. Believe me, I&rsquo;ve just scratched the surface.</p>
<p>Noble Prize John Nash-&#8220;The beaugifull Mind&#8221;- was born in Appalachia. If he hadn&rsquo;t becme mentally ill he would have won the Fields Medal. Field medalist winner John Milnor said he should have won one anyone.</p>

		<p>What is really needed is a moratorium on ALL immigration for ten years until we get the last batch assimilated. Does our govenment actually think, for instance, with the new Obamacare that we can squeeze millions more people into this country and have the same quality of health care we&rsquo;ve always had? Where will the extra doctors and health providers come from to take care of this overload? Will they then start importing &#8220;doctors&#8221; from India and the Caribbean? If so, God help us all. This is only one of the problems. When Obama waves his magic wand of citizenship over illegals, then they will immidiately be put on the rolls to get health care - not they don&rsquo;t get care already at the expense of the American taxpayer. But, it won&rsquo;t be just that. Translators for the many languages spoken here will be needed. This is a quagmire we&rsquo;ll never recover from.</p>

		<p>I think it might be helpful if we limit our strategies to ideas that have a chance of working in the near future.  Or at least in time for any hope for a measurable impact on our problem. Unfortunately there is no political force to the idea that a significant majority will listen to any idea or restriction on immigration coming from White Nationals, Race Realists, Conservatives, or Republicans.  To a large part of the body politic we have no credibility.  Any suggestions perceived to come from those aforementioned groups will be seen as trying to limit minority immigration and will be deemed racist and thrown aside; or to be blunt a political non-starter. That is not the only way to achieve the end though.</p>
<p>What about a using the issue and our suggested remedy to create a teaching moment and score a hit against one of the open borders propaganda themes to those voters the broad middle of the political spectrum? Use the diversity and melting pot language to justify the white or European increase.  I&rsquo;m not up on the number but last year figures of up to thirty five million illegal immigrant were estimated to have been forced into our melting pot most of Mexican or Hispanic origin.  Logic and fairness would say that such a large influx of one or two groups violate the diversity goal and throws the melting pot analogy out the window.  On the other hand if we limited immigration temporarily (like affirmative action is used against us) to immigrants of European descent until thirty five million is attained it could be argued balance and the melting pot justifies the correction.  While this argument too is not likely to find a majority of support it would be politically possible at least.

<p>Not as much as the &#8220;Kraut belt&#8221; from PA to MO, but a lot of Germans settled in the South.  The Sheanandoah Valley had a lot of them, as spillover after PA filled up.  Winston-Salem, NC was founded by Moravians.  There were enough German farmers at the time of the War Between the States in South Carolina, that had to settle for lesser land because the &#8220;Anglos&#8221; got there first, that Robert E. Lee wrote toward the end of the War to someone he knew in SC that needed people to work his land that he should get Germans in his state to come down from the hills,as they proved their salt with hilly land, so they would do great on flat land.</p>

		<p>The immigration laws of Latin American countries are a <i>de facto</i> example of this in action.  IQ isn&rsquo;t the criterion used, but nonetheless the IQ level of the few immigrants to these countries is probably a good 15, if not 20, points higher than the natives.  In the past, this has included waves of Japanese and Chinese to some countries. (There are more Japanese in São Paulo state than in all of North America.)   However, Latin Americans add a strong <i>cultural</i> component to naturalization procedures, so even Asians and Arabs assimilate better there than they do here.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Pitiful attempt, Realist. If you pull up a REAL Iq chart by the states you&rsquo;ll see the lowest scores are the South. West Virginia at 96. The Northern states, however, lead by only 4-2 pnts.</p>
<p>Tell me, if poor whites are close to Blacks in intelligence than why is it that a white kid that comes from a home earning 10,000 a year does better than a home earning 100,000?&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why. It&rsquo;s his behavior. The richer black child behaves (either through genetics or environment) much differently than the white child and decides his future from that very behavior. </p>
<p>And if you read Dr. Rushton and Dr. Lynn, you will see that indeed Irish average IQ is 93, while American black IQ is 85. German average IQ is 102. Do the math and Irish IQ is one point closer to that of American blacks than that of Germans. </p>
<p>But behaviorally, of course we know that the Irish are much closer to Germans than blacks. I&rsquo;ve been to Ireland, and in the downtown, barring religious fighting, at night, I still feel safe. </p>
<p>I love the Irish. It&rsquo;s just God compensated them elsewhere for the slight bit of intelligence points he took from them, on average. </p>

I think it might be helpful if we limit our strategies to ideas that have a chance of working in the near future. Or at least in time for any hope for a measurable impact on our problem. Unfortunately there is no political force to the idea that a significant majority will listen to any idea or restriction on immigration coming from White Nationals, Race Realists, Conservatives, or Republicans. To a large part of the body politic we have no credibility. Any suggestions perceived to come from those aforementioned groups will be seen as trying to limit minority immigration and will be deemed racist and thrown aside; or to be blunt a political.&#8221;</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly. While I ultimately believe that a white majority America is the best America, I know that we can&rsquo;t be straightforward about our goals. We&rsquo;ll be shot down before we ever get off the ground. We have to be crafty and avoid the wrath of the white liberal American that so dominates our American government today. </p>

<p>&#8220;What about a using the issue and our suggested remedy to create a teaching moment and score a hit against one of the open borders propaganda themes to those voters the broad middle of the political spectrum? Use the diversity and melting pot language to justify the white or European increase. I&rsquo;m not up on the number but last year figures of up to thirty five million illegal immigrant were estimated to have been forced into our melting pot most of Mexican or Hispanic origin. Logic and fairness would say that such a large influx of one or two groups violate the diversity goal and throws the melting pot analogy out the window. On the other hand if we limited immigration temporarily (like affirmative action is used against us) to immigrants of European descent until thirty five million is attained it could be argued balance and the melting pot justifies the correction. While this argument too is not likely to find a majority of support it would be politically possible at least. When the opponents push back with their arguments they have to argue against their own precepts&rsquo; of balance and diversity. In the long run, even if we fail it will have great utility in educating those in the middle who have not thought through race concepts or had enough life experience to challenge the status quo on race realities.

<p>That is quite an interesting suggestion. And it has fairness and reason backing it. Quite original. </p>
<p>&#8216;if we let in 35 million hispanics, in the interest of fairness to preserve the melting pot balance, then we ought to let in 35 million caucasian europeans.&rsquo;</p>

Granted, Asian and Indian non white physicians and engineers do not murder, rape and rob us as the hispanics and africans do, but the draconian facist laws of affirmative action decree that employeers must hire the non white immigrants with high IQs and high level qualifications instead of equally or even much better qualified American Whites.</p>

You are a traitor. You are offering Native Born White Americans a false choice. I come across more and more Native Born White Amerians Male Engineers who have a nothng but contempt- and some of them volcanic rage- towards the hindus and chinese. More asian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS meeans more asians in America to vote for the race-replacement and economic disopossesion-the two obvioulsy go handin-hand-of millions of Native Born White Males.</p>
<p>The chinese,hindus,sihks,koreans and vietnamese are not natural allies of Native Born White Americans. They are the mortal enemy of Native Born White Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>I totally agree with Realist.  I work at a major California University on the engineering and science campus.  I can tell you that the racial discrimination in hiring White male or any kind of American engineer, computer programmer or science graduate is absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>American engineering and computer graduates might as well be Indian untouchables as far as the companies that hire engineering and computer graduates are concerned.</p>
<p>Here is how it goes:  Hired in October to December, student visa non White foreigners due to graduate in June.  Hired January to April, legal non White immigrants.  Hired April 1 to June non White immigrants who are American citizens born to immigrants.</p>
<p>One young Chinese immigrant has a smart Father.  His Dad delayed his son&rsquo;s citizenship until Bob had a job and had worked for several months.  Bob is certain that not being a citizen at the time of hiring gave him a bit of an edge over citizens.</p>
<p>Companies do not want Americans.  That is the bottom line.  Whether it is bowing to the Judicial dictatorship that decrees no White Americans need apply or just corporate racism I do not know.</p>
<p>What most White American engineers, computer programers and scientists do is end up teaching high school math in some horrible ghetto school where they are abused not just by the savage primitive youth, but by the affirmative action non White female teachers and especially administrators.</p>
<p>The other choice is the military which welcomes engineers, computer programmers and scientists of all kinds into the officer corps or the nuclear submarine program.</p>
<p>Of course once in the military, the White American men are at the total bottom of the list as far as promotion goes.</p>

<p>You didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the presidential election last year, then. In case you didn&rsquo;t notice, McCain, the pseudo-conservative, won the White vote, which means the majority of White Americans are not liberal lapdogs. And yes, conservatives do understand &#8220;whites only&#8221; as you put it. The problem is that they can&rsquo;t act on it out of fear of losing their jobs and livelihoods, or being ostracized by friends and family. But I&rsquo;ve heard the whispered comments and jokes, and even my wife, who leans liberal, talks in realistic terms about blacks. Not because of political ideology or scientific facts, as she doesn&rsquo;t study those at all. It&rsquo;s because of personal observation. Of course, a nudge or two from me doesn&rsquo;t hurt, pointing out the obvious when it shows up on TV (think New Orleans after Katrina compared with Iowa after the Mississippi flooded, or the Gates affair).</p>
<p>I think it will be a long, winding road to get people to listen to the facts. And I think we need to work on it, one person at a time, privately, patiently, and persistently. But it will be difficult, if not impossible, in the present political climate to be bold and open about it.</p>

<p>I totally disagree with this. I&rsquo;ve lived all over and there are large numbers of unintelligent Whites in California as well as a large not-so-bright amount of lower class Whites in the Northeast and upper Midwest ie. Michigan. Also, miscegenation is more accepted in California than in the South or  anywhere else.</p>
<p>PS-People judge solely by IQ tests. I don&rsquo;t. Yes there are differing levels of intelligence amongst people buy you can&rsquo;t put a number on it. Many types of intelligence are not measured on IQ tests and neither are different types of stupidity. The Irish and there are many up North too, have made many contributions and anyways, today most Southerners(and Northerners) who have Irish in them are usually  mixed with English, Scots or German.

4) Lazy<br/>
5) Not very bright<br/>
6) Violent</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making value judgements here, but does that remind you of anyone?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the original Irish were so poorly thought of, that pre-colonial southern slaveowners thought nothing of marrying a female Irish immigrant to a black slave just so that they could take advantage of laws that said that anyone who married a slave was a slave, as was his/her children.  I&rsquo;m not making this up.</p>

I don&rsquo;t mean to hurt any Irish-American feelings, but the bottom line is that intelligence/ accomplishment can only be judged on a relative scale.</p>

		<p>The Realist is not only wrong but also assertive.</p>
<p>Richard Lynn&rsquo;s data chart fluctuates. This is why the Irish in 2006 and 2003 outperformed Germany in TIMSS and PISA. TIMSS(trends in mathematical science study)is an international test taken by industrialized countries to gauge achievement. These tests are highly correlated with g. Germany and Austria both performed mediocre. Recent IQ tests given to ethnic Germans in 2006 came up with an average of 99.</p>
<p>I think you have put too much stock into one data set and have not done further research. The best scoring European countries are usually England, Finland, Netherlands, Estonia and Switzerland. </p>
<p>Now if a black African country like Ghana or South Africa(the only two participating) came close to any Caucasian race I might reconsider your point.<br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Now here is why we should not support Richwine. Shutting down Hispanic and Caribbean immigration would require people to build a highly militarized fence. Our immigration quotas don&rsquo;t actually promote heavy Latin immigration but we get it anyway because they are right next door and third world. American security and immigration forces would have to use physical deterrence against illegals. Of course idiotic liberals would pull puppy-dog eyes and the necessary procedures would be abandoned.</p>
<p>Secondly third world immigration outside of central America is cream of the crop as it is. Indians, which Richwine likes to speak fondly of, are almost exclusively here because of tech visas. Africans(from Africa) likewise are cream of their crop and attend college at a higher percentage than white Americans. Obama&rsquo;s father went to Harvard for a PhD and one of Obama&rsquo;s half brother went to Stanford for a degree in physics.</p>
<p>So where is the issue? Richwine probably wants MORE immigration just higher standards. Realist is right that we may be shut down if we argue against solely non-white immigration but if we argue for LESS immigration all together. I believe Americans would support less immigration before higher standards.</p>

		<p>Let us not forget that the clever-clever semantic arguments and logic chopping used to prove black is white and up is down derive from another &#8220;high IQ&#8221; group for whom MENDACITY is how they even interpret their own ALPHABET.  Some could call this group THE OLDEST ENEMY but I couldn&rsquo;t comment.</p>

		<p>This idea will not work unless whites regain control of the government. IQ data can be manipulated. Many people aren&rsquo;t aware that the weight of verbal and visuo-spatial portions of IQ tests were reversed among other things done in testing to alter overall averages etc. The fact is we&rsquo;ve had just over 40 years of 90% non-white legal immigration to the US, never mind the 99.99% non-white illegal immigration to this country during that period, and the eruption in illegal immigration since the early 1980&rsquo;s.  Whites need control, and they need to strap on some, well, you know, and demand that their own receive preference in immigration after decades of the blatantly racist, anti-white immigration policy foisted on us by Emanuel Celler and crew, the authors of the Immigration Act of 1965. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Can&rsquo;t you see that this in-between step is a heck of a lot better than what we currently have? Don&rsquo;t you understand that this simple method of allowing in high IQ peoples will virtually eliminate Mexican/hispanic, Arab, and Black immigration?&#8221;</p>
<p>You are an absolute fool, &#8220;Realist&#8221;. You really think bottom feeder immigration would actually stop?</p>

		<p>&#8220;John Nash&rsquo;s Father was an engineer and his Mother was an Algebra and Trigonometry teacher, both high IQ jobs. He was not the son of degraded coal miners or hardscrabble farmers.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ugly stuff here.  For Margaret&rsquo;s information (wonderful poster though she is otherwise) a lot of us are descendents of those &#8220;degraded coal miners&#8221; and hardscrabble farmers.  Myself included!  </p>
<p>Not all of us were born with a silver spoon in our mouths, but we did the best we could. And we didn&rsquo;t do too badly after all. Not everyone can be the lord of the manor; but we manage, Margaret. Don&rsquo;t judge a person by whatever livlihood is imposed on him in order to survive. All honest labor should be considered decent and respectable. This snobbish class elitism is not helpful here.</p>

<p>It has become a form of sport among some groups to denigrate the people of Appalachia. It is really disgusting. I hate the movie Deliverance. I hate SNL(Appalachian clinic episode). I despise Jeff Foxworthy and other new Southern comics. They are making the $$$$ by denigrating the people of Appalachia. I can tell you from first hand experience  that the hindus have caught on to this. </p>
<p>I hiked up Crowder mountain-just outside Charlotte-one day. Spoke to a fellow hiker who was first generation Greek American an transplant from NY. He had utter contempt for the local population in the area. It was real hatred. He just assumed that I being from the East Coast would share his antipathy for the people of Appalachia. He was in a state of shock when I came to their defense.</p>
<p>Werner Von Braun and his German rocket scientist team down in Huntsville Alabam recruited heavily from the Southern University system of the Deep South for Engineering talent(this was covered on the history Channel). Southern Native Born White Males are heavily represented on the Space Shuttle maintenaince crew(History Channel)</p>
<p>The post-1965 LEGAL asian immigrants and their &#8220;american&#8221; born children want us to accept the big lie that without their presence in America, Native Born White Americans just wouldn&rsquo;t be able to produce the America&rsquo;s Scientists,Engineers,computer programmers and physicians. This is a bold face lie and Jared Taylor must destroy this lie everytime he speaks on radio and National TV.</p>
<p>The post-1965 asian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS and their &#8220;american&#8221; born geneline are insisting that Native Born White Americans commit racial suicide within the borders of America. Native Born White Americans should not oblige them. If Jared Taylor and Peter Brimelow frame the issue the right way in their public appearances they will mobilize a large population of Native Born White Americans to revolt against their race replacement at the hands of post-1965 asians,muslims,hispanics and africans. WE are in a demographically precarous situation at the current time.</p>
<p>Here are some more  &#8220;imbecile&#8221; Irish Americans:John McCarthy created the field of Artificial Intelligence and the LISP programming language;Andrew Gleason-Gleason&rsquo;s theorem-Harvard professor of Mathematics(deceased). One of the deepest and hottest areas of Mathematics is something called Von-Neumann algebras. This came out of the seminal work of Von-Neumann and Murray(Irish ancestry).</p>
<p>Ireland is home to one of the most important theoretical physics research institiutes  in the world at Trinity College.</p>

		<p>A few more Irish, Scittish and Irish-Scott low IQ imbeciles:</p>
<p>Irish physcist George Fitzgerald who bascally figured most of special relativity before Albert Einstien, Contribution to humanity:Fortgerald-Lorentz contractions and deduced the special relativity consequences from Maxwells&rsquo;s Equations.</p>
<p>The low IQ Scotish imbecile James Clerk Maxwell:codified the deep physical insights of the &#8220;imbecile&#8221; fifth grade-or was it fourth grade-working  English working class drop out Michael Farady.</p>
<p>Physicist-Mathematician and Irish-Scott John Stokes(born in Ireland). Contribution to humanity:Navier-Stokes Equation. If you can prove that the 3D solution exists you will win the one million dollar Clay Mathematics Institute prize for solving one of the five one million dollar milenium prizes;Stokes theorem(all the hindus studying in America know about Stokes theorem)</p>
<p>How did European peole-including the Native Born White American and Canadian ones survive all the decades when LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians were not in OUR nations? Quite well thank you.<br/>

		<p>&#8220;As someone who has lived in various parts of the south for the past 10 years, I&rsquo;ve observed that southern whites have a significantly larger low IQ underclass than whites in other parts of the country. Predictably, black/white miscegenation is more common (and accepted) there than in other regions.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with the second part of your post.  White southerners are the most racially conscious whites in the nation.  Where in the world did you come up with what you just wrote?  </p>
<p>This has nothing to do with intelligence.  Southerners may have lower IQs but Northerners have proven to be more ignorant on the race issue simply because they don&rsquo;t live around minorities as much.  </p>
<p>Perhaps you see more miscegination in the South because there are simply more minorities down here?  But I don&rsquo;t even know if that is true.  Most miscegnation that I see has been on trips to Northern cities.  As a Southerner, I am telling you, that your conclusion is wrong.<br/>

		<p>&#8220;People, liberal American people (which is to say the majority of white americans these days) will understand truth and science before they understand &lsquo;whites only&rsquo;. &#8220;</p>
<p>Realist, you really aren&rsquo;t making any sense.  The majority of white Americans are still conservative for the most part.  Poll after poll keeps proving this.  Obama won this last election because of a great deal of minority support and the fact that many whites sat the election out because neither candidate really represented them.  You can&rsquo;t look at the outcome of an election by itself to determine if most whites are liberal or conservative.</p>
<p>And you accuse Jupiter of being unscientific.  And you say liberal whites like scientific arguments. If that is the case, then why do they refuse to acknowledge that blacks, hispanics and many other groups other than Northeast Asians are less intelligent than whites?  </p>
<p>And for him to argue what he is arguing in NO way means he rejects the evidence that SOME Asians are smarter. We shouldn&rsquo;t even have to acknowledge this.  What does this have to do with us wanting to keep our nation ruled from bottom up by white people?  </p>
<p>Just because my next door neighbor is smarter than me does that mean I should invite him to live in my house permanently to do my taxes for me and everything else that requires brain work? Do you realize how silly your argument is?  And I don&rsquo;t fully agree that this nation would be better off with the smartest Asians living here anyways.</p>

		<p>Jupiter, your several postings concerning the subject of Irish intellect was interesting. I had a math professor in College, and elderly gentleman, Dr. Donny Archer. He was one of the most lovable and decent teachers I ever came across. As a math instructor he was crystal clear. Students would pass his classes(math analysis, calculas,I,II,III.)because he was such a great teacher and actually cared if the students learned or not. I was going to drop his class because math was never my strong point. When I came to him with a drop slip, for his signature, he said, &#8220;Ah, come on. Your not going to chicken out are you?  You can get a C by just listening to me in your sleep. This so boosted my moral, that I got a B in his class and believe me, this was at a time that school subjects were not yet dumbed down. He saved me from losing at least a semester. </p>
<p>The same charge you addressed,of the Irish being accused by some of not being too sharp mentally,used to get him going. While at the chalkboard,demonstrating the solution to a problem, he would occasionally turn around and ask the class with a slight smile on his face,&#8221;is that right? Did I get that correct? I&rsquo;m just a stupid Irishman.&#8221; He blamed the English for his attitude. It was at a time that the trouble in Northern Ireland was really peaking, so that might have been some of the motivation for his remarks. </p>

<p>Several years ago, a 16 year Irish  teenager named Sarah Flannigan made front page news for a mathematical breakthrough she made in the field of public key cryptography. She wrote a book about it which can be found in the math section of Borders and Barnes and Noble bookstores.</p>
