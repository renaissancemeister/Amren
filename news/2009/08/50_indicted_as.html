<h1>50 Indicted As Part of National Marriage Fraud Scheme</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, August 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) today began locating and arresting 50 people named in 27 federal indictments charging them with participating in a Cincinnati-based scheme to arrange sham marriages in order to evade U.S. immigration laws. Those indicted include 23 people who are in the United States illegally and 27 U.S. citizens they married.</p>
<p>33 individuals were subsequently taken into federal custody.</p>
<p>Gregory G. Lockhart, U. S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, and Brian Moskowitz, special agent in charge of ICE&rsquo;s Office of Investigations in Detroit, announced the arrests and indictments today.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury returned the indictments on August 5. The indictments were unsealed today. All 50 are charged with marriage fraud. Forty-nine are also charged with making false written statements and 39 are charged with making false representations. Each of the crimes is punishable by up to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $250,000 and three years of supervised release. Those who are in the country illegally also face deportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marriage fraud poses a major vulnerability that must not go unchallenged,&#8221; ICE Assistant Secretary John Morton said. &#8220;The significant number of indictments today as well the previous convictions that have been handed down as a result of Operation Honeymoon&rsquo;s Over should send the unambiguous message that ICE will not tolerate the exploitation of our country&rsquo;s immigration system. Whether you are marrying one person under false pretenses or various people, or facilitating the fraud, know this  &mdash;  you will be found, arrested and held accountable for your actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The investigation has unraveled a scheme to arrange marriages between Eastern European aliens and U.S. citizens,&#8221; Lockhart said. &#8220;The Eastern Europeans paid a fee to the U.S. citizens and the leaders of the conspiracy to arrange the marriage. They created false documents indicating that the marriages were legal and presented the false documents to immigration officials.&#8221;</p>
<p>These arrests are part of an ongoing investigation dubbed Operation Honeymoon&rsquo;s Over. Ten of the individuals were indicted in May 2009 on charges of conspiracy to commit marriage fraud. Of those, eight Cincinnati-area residents have already pleaded guilty to arranging multiple sham marriages in order to help resident aliens obtain permanent legal residence status. They are awaiting sentencing.</p>
<p>The two others indicted in May remain at large. To date, this investigation has led to 13 convictions.</p>
<p>Conspiracy to commit marriage fraud is punishable by up to five years imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000 and three years of supervised release.</p>
<p>Last year, ICE made 238 criminal arrests related to marriage fraud schemes and was successful in handing out convictions for 198 of those individuals. ICE also seized nearly $430,000 in assets related to these cases.<br>

		<p>Well, they&rsquo;re real good at prosecuting alien whites for immigration schemes.</p>
<p>However, having lived in Eastern Europe, I know that they are pretty bold about committing really transparent scams to do things like get into the U.S.  They are also terribly transparent when it comes to greedy little fraud schemes.  My guess is that a life under communism did not prepare them to understand the complexities and seriousness of laws.  They also grew up being told how much smarter they are than Westerners, especially Americans.  Most really believe that no American could be as smart as them.  Then they hatch really dumb schemes like this one.  However, they do know how to play on soft-hearted liberals.  Many such people get sucked in through their churches to sponsor someone from Eastern Europe or the Balkans and end up just being used as a springboard into America as much as this marriage scheme does.</p>

		<p>&#8221; A major vulnerability that must not go unchallenged&hellip;&#8221; Hmmm. As a never maried man over fifty I have a problem with this one. I think anybodys first should be a &#8220;gimmie&#8221;. No questions asked. As for the next, kinda tough to GET tough, when lots of people get married five or six times in country. THAT ought to be a crime. Letting more people into your life than into your country. Just my opinion. Hate to get help up with re-entry red tape if I ever do meet that Scandanavian snow bunny. Think Andy William`s and &#8220;Canadian Sunset.&#8221;</p>

		<p>So which is a more efficient use of taxpayer resources in terms of enforcing immigration laws; carrying out an expensive investigation of a bunch of White European Gypsies and their immigration lawyers and co-conspirators  (WORST CASE SCENARIO) or going to Wal-Mart in Anytown USA with a a pair of conscripted school activity buses and four ICE agents on overtime pay any Saturday afternoon of the year?</p>

		<p>So thousands of illegals are crawling across the borders, thousands are neglecting visa expirations, thousands are working in slaughter factories and yard work.. but we spend hundreds of hours and much manpower making complicated and time consuming investigations of &#8220;Fake marriages&#8221; of a few hundred people..  </p>
<p>Or maybe a better question, was this another sting operation by our government that included the Investigators actually setting up the fake marriages/ marriage business and then arresting those they entrapped?  I mean isn&rsquo;t that how most terrorists and criminals are caught today: Government sets up criminal enterprise to entice people to commit crimes, then arrest them, and then make a big press release?</p>

<p>Yeah, no kidding.  I read about the following every few months in the local papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A former Armenian consul, three Glendale residents and a substance abuse counselor have been arrested for allegedly selling immigration letters to undocumented convicted felons, including murderers and rapists, that allowed them to stay in the United States and avoid deportation.</p>
<p>The five reportedly sold official letters from the Armenian Consulate for upward of $35,000.</p>
<p>The purchasers, who had been convicted for murder, attempted murder, rape, robbery and kidnapping, were facing deportation due to their offenses, which were committed in the U.S., Kice said&hellip;.They used contacts in the Armenian government to obtain the letters, which were sent to ICE to prevent deportation, according to criminal complaints&hellip;&#8221;w</p>
<p>Why would armenia and georgia and other Eastern European countries want their murderers, kidnappers, robbers and rapists back?  Why not unload &#8216;em just as castro did with the muriel boatlift?  Let them be American&rsquo;s problem!</p>
