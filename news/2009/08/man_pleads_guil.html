<h1>Man Pleads Guilty to Racial Threat Using Fake Facebook Account</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, August 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An African-American man has pleaded guilty after being accused of impersonating a white supremacist in a fictitious Facebook account to make death threats against an African-American university student.</p>
<p>Dyron L. Hart, 20, of Poplarville, Mississippi, {snip} admitted creating the fictitious account in November, pretending to be a white supremacist outraged by the election of Barack Obama as the nation&rsquo;s first African-American president, the statement said.</p>
<p>He then transmitted a death threat via Facebook to an African-American student at Nicholls State University in Louisiana, saying he wanted to kill African-Americans because of Obama&rsquo;s election, according to the statement.</p>
<p>A court document {snip} said Hart admitted creating the Facebook profile under the name &#8220;Colten Brodoux&#8221; and used a photo of a Caucasian man that he found on a white supremacist Web site.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an extremely odd case, a very unusual case,&#8221; said U.S. Attorney Jim Letten of the Eastern District of Louisiana. {snip}</p>

		<p>I disagree with the U.S. Attorney General that this is a very unusual case.  I think it&rsquo;s a very usual case of black racial hoaxes.  Also, you can bet that good ole Mo Dees used this to raise money, to prove his contention of hateful white rhetoric toward President Obama.  Will Dees and Co. have to give that money back?</p>

<p> Nothing odd or unusual about it. Just another black trying to invent more racist problems so he can be the &#8220;victim&#8221;. A hoax which will probably be laughed off and he will be given a light slap on the wrist and told &#8221; naughty boy&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Why isn&rsquo;t he charged with a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, and federal &#8220;terrorist threats&#8221;, since it was interstate?</p>
<p>I can see the standard defense now from blacks who commit such acts - &#8220;we was only funnin&#8221;..</p>

		<p>Unusual?  This sort of thing happens every two weeks.  Blacks get a great deal of satisfaction faking hate crimes against themselves or other blacks.</p>

		<p>yes this is now typical - white on black threats are now mainly hoaxes.  we had one in atlanta after the pres. election.  some crack whore set her own house on fire, then faked some hate graffiti THEN was stupid enough to call the news media saying her place was vandalized because she supported barack obama.  turns out of course it was all fake, and she was wanted on some arrest warrants due to drugs.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s the typical black genius.   Making death threats, then leaving a trail that even Inspector Clouseau could follow.</p>
<p>In a small town near me a black called in a bomb threat to a restaurant in town that he thought didn&rsquo;t cater enough to blacks, and he used his home phone.  I have no doubt when the police showed up at his door he probably was mystified as to how they knew it was him.</p>
<p>And I also have no doubt that he&rsquo;s positive white oppression and racism are the reasons blacks don&rsquo;t score very high on tests.</p>

		<p>You can bet that hoaxes of this kind will soon be even more common with Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;Chicago style&#8221; administration in the White House. There has already been instances of leftists pretending to be Nazis carrying swastikas at some of the town hall meetings over health care. The Democrat party has been taken over by left-wing radicals that have absolutely no integrity or sense of fair play. The act of this man is but one example of a tactic that is used by the left to discredit conservatives. </p>

		<p>Of course this bum is a racist and hates White people. But I find it interesting that the posters seem to think along the lines they do. The &#8220;law&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to me any longer, and it shouldn&rsquo;t to us as a group either. The way is clear for us now. There is no turning back now. So to keep holding onto old ideas like justice for our people in this system that exists today is ridiculous. That&rsquo;s what our adversaries want. for us to think in terms of reasoning with them. Too late for that. Free yourselves from such thoughts. Move on and prepare yourselves for the next step in this ongoing situation we live in. Don&rsquo;t get caught flatfooted by events.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;.&rsquo;This is an extremely odd case, a very unusual case,&rsquo;  said U.S. Attorney Jim Letten of the Eastern District of Louisiana&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The US attorney is either lying or getting his information only through the government-controlled media that refuse to print these types of stories.  I suspect he&rsquo;s lying.</p>
<p>This is typical of the controlled media. </p>
<p>As Steve Sailor reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;there&rsquo;s a tremendous hunger in modern America for news accounts of white violence against blacks. But there isn&rsquo;t enough actual supply of white-on-black violence to meet the overwhelming demand. So the press promotes hoaxes, as with Duke&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been reading screaming headlines about the rise and threat of White Supremacy.  The media claim huge surging numbers of White Supremacists joining hate groups and frothing at the mouth in anger at a black president, hell-bent on revenge. </p>
<p>Of course, potok of the $PLC is trotted out by the media front and center to comment without rebuttal.  To the media, the $PLC is THE source and authority on White Hate:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.&rsquo;I don&rsquo;t think these are simply people who are mentally ill or off their rocker,&rsquo; Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told ABC News of those behind the threats. &#8216;In a very real sense they represent a genuine reaction, a genuine backlash against Obama.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, right. This is merely a ruse for re-implementation of the Fairness Doctrine, passage of more Hate Crime laws, suppression of Whites and censorship of the internet.</p>
<p>The media and the educational-industrial complex are the true enemies of White Americans.</p>
<p>These black &#8216;hoaxers&rsquo; are never, ever publicized, exposed and held accountable for their crimes  &mdash;  and that&rsquo;s exactly what these hoaxes are, hate crimes against Whites because of the damage done to the White community. </p>
<p>Until we organize and fund our own advocates who speak in our interests, we will continue to be debased by the media.</p>

We should be thanking Mr. Hart for his dedication to keep &#8216;hate&rsquo; and &#8216;racism&rsquo; in the public mind. Without these hoaxes, we might fail to see how pervasive hate and racism are.</p>

		<p>I hate to point this out here, but perhaps this is more of a Southern thing.  What I mean is that I think I can recall a couple white women in recent history, ditching their car and their kids and then making up a story about how they were hijacked by a black.  The difference is that they thought they could use the racism they expected for support of themselves, whereon, this guy hoped to impugne the entire white race.  But with Obama in the white house, this sort of thing has to be expected by anyone with a tinge of race realism in them.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t an unusal case.  This kinds of hoaxes are becoming commonplace and will get steadly worse because they keep getting away with it with just a slap on the wrist.  </p>

		<p>He should get the same penalty as a real White would have certainly gotten.<br>
Obviously all charges will be dropped, because the AG would be too embarrased to charge someone who isn&rsquo;t White, even if he is guilty.</p>
