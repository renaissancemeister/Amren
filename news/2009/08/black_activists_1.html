			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Devona Walker and ColorOfChnage.org, The Loop, August 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The minority-run ColorOfChange.org is campaigning against the ultra conservative commentator Glenn Beck. They have persuaded more than 20 advertisers including CBS, Wal-Mart, LexisNexis-owned Lawyers.com, Procter &amp; Gamble and Progressive Insurance to pull their ads.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We have watched FOX News attack President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Black America. Bill O&rsquo;Reilly called for the death of murdered abortion doctor George Tiller only months before his death. Remember, too, it was the FOX-owned New York Post who printed the monkey cartoon. It was also FOX News who lashed out against Hurricane Katrina evacuees, arguing they were to blame for an increase in homicides. Yet, the network tried to cover up the incompetence of the Bush administration that led to the deaths of many Blacks in New Orleans.</p>
<p>FOX News has been veiling racism with conservative values for years. {snip}</p>
<p>Folks have criticized Blacks for being unengaged in the political process, for allowing things to happen to us, and whining. But in 2008, we increased our votes by two million people, to 64.7 percent  &mdash;  on par with white America and nearly 20 percent higher than other racial minorities. And now, it&rsquo;s Black activists who are trying to silence the radical racism and race-baiting on the far right so the grown folks can get back to debating policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The birthers phenomenon makes it pretty clear. The heart of the birthers argument is a xenophobic and racist one. Folks are so distraught over having a Black president that they embrace a theory that&rsquo;s been clearly debunked. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The endgame is to reduce the size of Beck&rsquo;s platform and force FOX and other cable news organizations to pull back from the brink.</p>
<p>In terms of the term &#8220;racist.&#8221; It appears that Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, etc, folks many minorities would feel epitomize the word racist, are the ones who keep throwing the word around. {snip} [This strategy is] brilliant and they need to be called out on it. They&rsquo;re pulling the teeth out of the term  &mdash;  basically accusing anyone who is talking about race and, in their mind, not being fair, as a racist. White people don&rsquo;t feel equipped to challenge them (impaired by our society&rsquo;s general fear and inability to talk about race), and the Black folks who could push back have yet to find a platform on par with theirs to do so.<br>

		<p>It is despicable cowardice and ignorance for advertisers to pull out of the Beck show. Beck is what he is. Any advertiser knew who they supported when they signed on. Now they run away because of a wacko black group. American business is gutless. Eventually the Chinese will show them what guts really are as US big business is cut down to miniscule size.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like those companies haven&rsquo;t been drinking the kool-aid for years so it probably didn&rsquo;t take much persuasion.</p>
<p><i>We have watched FOX News attack President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Black America.</i></p>
<p>Yes. Yes. And NO. FOX News has been critical of Barry and the Beast but not any more than the other networks were critical of Bush. But FOX has not attacked blacks. It just doesn&rsquo;t suck up to them.</p>
<p><i>FOX News has been veiling racism with conservative values for years.</i></p>
<p>On the contrary, the other networks have been mixing racism with liberalism for years.</p>
<p><i>And now, it&rsquo;s Black activists who are trying to silence the radical racism and race-baiting on the far right so the grown folks can get back to debating policy.</i> </p>
<p>Radical racism and race-baiting on the far right? Really? The left has had a corner on that market for over 50 years.</p>
<p><i>The birthers phenomenon makes it pretty clear. The heart of the birthers argument is a xenophobic and racist one. Folks are so distraught over having a Black president that they embrace a theory that&rsquo;s been clearly debunked.</i></p>
<p>Saying it&rsquo;s debunked doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s debunked. Show us the certificate of live birth and I&rsquo;ll be happy to shut up about it. Besides, denigrating one&rsquo;s detractors by labelling them (ie birthers) usually suggests one doesnt have the facts on their side.</p>
<p><i>The endgame is to reduce the size of Beck&rsquo;s platform and force FOX and other cable news organizations to pull back from the brink.</i></p>
<p>Not a chance. FOX and Beck&rsquo;s ratings are THROUGH THE ROOF! :)</p>
<p><i>In terms of the term &ldquo;racist.&rdquo; It appears that Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, etc, folks many minorities would feel epitomize the word racist, are the ones who keep throwing the word around. {snip} [This strategy is] brilliant and they need to be called out on it.</i></p>
<p>How ironic. I&rsquo;ve thought the exact same thing about blacks and liberals for years. It&rsquo;s about time they got some of their own medicine.</p>
<p><i>They&rsquo;re pulling the teeth out of the term &mdash; basically accusing anyone who is talking about race and, in their mind, not being fair, as a racist.</i></p>
<p>Thank GOD! It&rsquo;s about freaking time some neutered that term. Blacks and liberals have been wielding it like a club for decades.<br>

		<p>What has got blacks bad-mouthing and shreiking hysterically about Glenn Beck is the fact that he came right out and said he thinks Obama is a racist on his show, then he had on a psychiatrist who has evaluated Obama and agreed with him.</p>
<p>Beck then went on Fox and Friends and said again he thought Obama was racist.</p>
<p>Blacks just hate it when a person isn&rsquo;t afraid to tell the truth. They ALWAYS want the truth submerged as it concerns race.  Why? Well, if this sort of thing keeps up, high profile whites are going to start telling the truth about black ability and intelligence and come right out and say blacks can&rsquo;t get ahead, because they don&rsquo;t have the intellect and ability and no amount of distortions will ever change that.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the youtube videos from another post.  Watch them.  They&rsquo;re devastating to Obama and the black liars.</p>

		<p>ColorOfChange is a racist oranization unto it&rsquo;s self. Obviously it believes the only &#8220;Colors of Change&#8221;, are people of Color, and not whites.</p>
<p>The organization is a joke, just like all other colored racist anti-white thugish organizations out there are. You have to be forceful with these anti-white thugs, you can&rsquo;t be soft and allow these racist clowns to bully you. </p>
<p>I hope Foxs news doesn&rsquo;t allow organizations of a few thousand to determine how freely they will air what the heck they want on their channel.</p>

		<p>No. FOX News, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and Bill O&rsquo;Reilly tell the truth. And the truth is a terrible thing to a group that, just because they are black, considers themselves above the law and has been given the right to rob hard working Americans of the money they earned through unfair taxes.</p>

		<p>Walker is either ignorant or a liar.  O&rsquo;Reilly never called for the death of Tiller.  I&rsquo;m sure with all her research skills, she can come up with the tape of him saying that.  But don&rsquo;t let the truth get in the way of black radical propaganda.  Devona Walker is a perfect example of the pathetic state of black journalism today.</p>

		<p>&#8221; Devona Walker is a perfect example of the pathetic state of black journalism today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Devona Walker is an incompetent, and her rambling story full of errors of fact and lack of any real reasoning ability convinces me that blacks don&rsquo;t have any kind of journalistic publications that are not sub par, just like everything else they&rsquo;re involved with.</p>
<p>Regarding the advertisers who allegedly pulled their ads, don&rsquo;t be so gullible, people.  Most blacks are natural liars and it&rsquo;s common practice for them to insert lies where facts should be.</p>
<p>Also, is anybody aware that advertisers are tripping over each other to get a spot on Fox news&hellip;..anywhere, but especially on shows that have 4 million plus viewers like O&rsquo;Reilly and Beck.</p>
<p>As was pointed out, Fox represents the only network that is telling the truth about the messiah, and it has blacks screaming bloody murder.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re viewership goes up every month it seems.  They just passed CBS in total number of viewers during prime news time, which is phenomenal for a subscriber based network.  CBS is free.</p>
<p>If things are going so well for the mentally-challenged Devona&rsquo;s people and so badly for fox, then why is she in hysterical mode?  </p>

		<p>I am glad they are going after Glenn Beck.  He complained about how much illegal immigrants are costing American tax payers on his radio show. I called him and said &#8221; you mention all these problems immigrants cause but then say &#8216;but I don&rsquo;t have a problem with legal immigrant&rsquo;, but Americans due care about the money that LEGAL immigrants are costing them and the demographic change it is causing.&#8221; He said &#8220;no, they don&rsquo;t&#8221; and then hung up on me; he and his sidekick Stew then made fun of me on the air and called me a racist.  He is now getting a taste of his own medicine. Average people have no joyce about becoming a minority in their country but he has used his influence to state that legal immigration and the changing demographics is good for Americans. </p>

		<p>This whole thing with Glenn Beck really started, not when he called Obama a racist (he didn&rsquo;t really), it started when Glenn Beck began exposing Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;Czars&#8221;- in particular, Van Johnson. <br>
Van Johnson is Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;Green&#8221; Czar and is a SELF-AVOWED communist. Calling Van Johnson a communist is not the raving of some conspiracy nut, it is an easily established FACT. What the Obama creatures are angry about is that Glenn Beck and Fox News let the cat out of the bag. They were hoping that this fact would go forever unreported by the News Media. Alas, Fox is not a propaganda outlet for the Obama administration like the rest of the networks are and the Obamabots have to silence the truth somehow. Having a bunch of Blacks launch a campaign to have advertisers pull out from Fox is the natural technique we would expect from a bunch of filthy community organizers. <br>
Let us launch a boycott of our own. Write to these companies and tell them that you will no longer avail yourself of their services or products and tell them why. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a two-way street. Whites can also stop patronizing stores and avoid purchasing the products of companies which caved to the racist ColorofChange outfit. As for blacks boycotting Walmart or similar stores - give me a break. Their limited grasp of politics, low IQ, inability to stay focused, and immediate desire for cheap goods make this whole episode pointless.</p>

		<p>America&rsquo;s collective cowardice everytime some rabble-rouser howls &#8220;racism&#8221; is almost certainly going to be the death of this country. These advertisers pull away from a channel that is, for better or worse, extremely popular with what is left of White America, and though an ever dwindling demographic, that is just where those companies&rsquo; bread is buttered! If these companies think they are going to keep their profit margins as fat in a post-White majority America, they are as delusional as they are stupid. </p>

		<p>The relentless blackmail of organizations like &#8220;ColorofChange&#8221; is possible ONLY because White Americans choose to let the term &#8220;racist&#8221; buckle their knees.</p>
<p>Until Whites are able to confront the term head-on and accept the astounding truth that there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with having a racialist, pro-White survival strategy for themselves, their families, their people, and their nation, we will be vulnerable to the pressures of guilt that are thrust upon us.</p>
<p>Quit being afraid.  Quit feeling guilty for things YOU did not do.  Be proud of who and what you are, and have the courage to stand up and assert &#8220;My people and I have value, we are unique, and we have the RIGHT to self-determination and the perpetuation of our existence.&#8221;  Be unashamedly, unreservedly pro-White, and work for the interest of your people.</p>
<p>And if they call you a racist for doing so, laugh in their faces and keep right on working.  If you let the opposition&rsquo;s opinion of you deter you from doing what is right, you cannot hope to win.</p>

<p>I think the reason that George Soros&rsquo;s hired hands are going after Glenn Beck is not because he&rsquo;s telling the truth, but because he&rsquo;s a phony about it.  If anything, blacks don&rsquo;t like two-timing and phony-baloney attitudes even more than one telling the truth about racial differences.</p>

		<p>It amazes me that under Obummer&rsquo;s administration, race relations in this country have deteriorated faster than ever before. Far from being a &#8220;post-racial&#8221; society we are now much more balkanized and distrusting of others. And rightly so, as the race card gets pulled out everytime there is any conflict or even discussion between whites and blacks. We need to segregate once again or the downward spiral in relations will continute. The Great American Melting Pot experiment, the grand delusion of guilt-ridden white social engineers, is an abject failure. Lincoln once said that a people enslaved by another can never peacefully co-exist in a free society&hellip;and we was proven right.</p>

		<p>Confronted with this article, I cannot help but laugh heartily.  Just how low an IQ do these racially blinded people have?  I couldn&rsquo;t even get past the first line without smiling (&#8220;the ultra conservative commentator Glenn Beck&#8221;).  </p>
<p>I thought this comment was interesting:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was also FOX News who lashed out against Hurricane Katrina evacuees, arguing they were to blame for an increase in homicides.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is undeniably true.  So the question is, why is she against the report, and why shouldn&rsquo;t we be incensed at those news agencies that downplayed or ignored this fact?</p>
<p>Notice the use of the terms &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; - the hallmarks of a racial solidarity movement, tolerated of all but whites.</p>
<p>The poor blacks, though - their interests will next be trumped by Hispanics who actively dislike them, rather than pander to them as whites do.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this:</p>
<p>&#8220;The heart of the birthers argument is a xenophobic and racist one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xenophobic?  What does that even mean, in this context?  Or would US voters be expected to accept a president who was not a legal US citizen?</p>
<p>&#8220;The endgame is to reduce the size of Beck&rsquo;s platform and force FOX and other cable news organizations to pull back from the brink.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, what&rsquo;s happened instead is that AirAmerica etc. has died out from lack of listeners.  People will ultimately support the truth, not the hype.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black folks who could push back have yet to find a platform on par with theirs to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation:  generally speaking, blacks have neither the intellect nor the evidence to make their racial case.<br>

<p>Oh, yes he did.  Absolutely!</p>
<p>&#8220;This guy, I believe, is a racist,&#8221; were the words he used.  Take a look at the video.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI_0Kt_e3Go" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI_0Kt_e3Go</a></p>
<p>And also on the other program with the psychiatrist, where they both agreed Obama didn&rsquo;t like white people and was prejudiced toward them, Beck also said Obama was a racist.  If you can understand it, the psychiatrist doesn&rsquo;t want to come out and say the word &#8220;racist&#8221; in describing Obama, but there&rsquo;s no question that&rsquo;s exactly what he is saying in so many words.</p>
<p>Take a look at the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfw6ie6Pgak" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfw6ie6Pgak</a>  In fact, the youtube headline for the video is, &#8220;Psychitrist thinks Obama is racist.&#8221; Or words to that effect.</p>
<p>What I would like to ask you, Bilbo, is where are your points of debate showing me where I misquoted either of these men?  On what basis do you determine that Beck and the psychiatrist DIDN&rsquo;T<br>
call Obama racist?</p>
<p>Also, pointing toward Van Jones as a reason for black discontent tells me you understand only PART of the picture.  Van Jones, a black theologist/nationalist, and self-avowed communist, is an anti-white racist himself, but is only one of several issues, or persons, Beck has highlighted to support his analysis, which has caused blacks to go ballistic.   </p>
<p>Much of what Beck includes in his analysis in determining that Obama is a racist, has equal distaste for blacks, not just the Van Jones revelation.</p>
<p>But, by far, the greatest&hellip;&hellip;absolutely seismic utterance by Beck&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.that turned black hate for Beck into black hysterical loathing is his evaluation of Obama as a racist.  And, having a well-respected, top-rated psychiatrist agreeing with him brought more adverse light on Obama than anything that has occurred to date.  If we had a non-biased press, it would have been a headline in every paper&hellip;.. or at the least a front page story.</p>
<p>I mean, can you understand the importance of calling the president of the US a racist and, unlike blacks when they constantly call a white that, providing credible information in support of his charges.</p>
<p>But the most important aspect of this entire incident is that both these men are right on in describing this pro-black community organizer as a racist.</p>

		<p>Blacks just hate it when a person isn&rsquo;t afraid to tell the truth. They ALWAYS want the truth submerged as it concerns race. Why? Well, if this sort of thing keeps up, high profile whites are going to start telling the truth about black ability and intelligence and come right out and say blacks can&rsquo;t get ahead, because they don&rsquo;t have the intellect and ability and no amount of distortions will ever change that. </p>
<p>True, in the long run, the one thing they fear the most is the truth, and everything they do is about suppressing the truth from getting out there.</p>

		<p>I always marvel when I hear people complain that folks like Glenn Beck and Lou Dobbs are sellouts, or traitors, or whatever, because they openly embrace legal immigration.  The fact is that Glenn Beck and Lou Dobbs would lose the platforms they have currently if they took their public anti-immigration stances to those levels.  It might make all of US feel better to hear them say quite openly and from a national television &#8220;bully pulpit&#8221; the things we say here (anonymously, of course&hellip;lol), but those pulpits would then be yanked out from underneath them in no time, and the few, very public voices there are currently for white-oriented interests would be gone altogether.  I, for one, am willing to live with the concession of not hearing even more strident talk, in exchange for being able to hear this kind of talk at all, even in a more muted form, on popular television networks watched by millions.</p>
<p>If Glenn Beck gets to keep his show after getting on television and calling the President of the United States an anti-white racist, then I think it&rsquo;s a hopeful start.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t terribly like Glenn Beck, as he is quite the &#8220;anti-racist.&#8221; </p>
<p>What Fox really needs to do is give Jared Taylor or Professors Hart or Rushton a show of their own.  Now THAT would be worth turning my TV on for.  Haven&rsquo;t bothered to watch tv in at least half a year since my favorite show ended, and the last time I flipped it on to C-Span the senate was apologizing for slavery, disgusting.</p>
<p>I think Taylor has a real shot at getting one, too.  He&rsquo;s been on multiple &#8220;mainstream&#8221; shows (to be honest though his appearance on the Latifa show made me retch, that woman is insufferable), and when the far leftists call him a racist it doesn&rsquo;t really stick.  He&rsquo;s not the sort of fellow you can easily imagine running around shouting &#8216;white power!&rsquo; while waving a nazi flag around either, which makes him that much more important.</p>

		<p>Tom and HH, you are so right.</p>
<p> No, Beck and all the others on radio and TV could care less about the demographic bomb that will soon explode in our nation, (as long as these intruders are &#8220;legal&#8221;). They will call the caller who dares mention this all sorts of names, just as the lefties do. In fact I think these so-called conservative shows are worse. We know what to expect from the left of the aisle. </p>
<p>The collective cowardice of American Whites has always left me baffled. They will not do a thing to stop the insanity and will divert their listeners attention away from the &#8220;racial&#8221; aspect and pretend it is just all about taxes, loss of freedom and now the health care debacle.  Can they not put two and two together and realize it is all coming about BECAUSE of the onslaught of the 3rd world being shoved down our collective throats? </p>

		<p>Let me just say to the above posters who have rightly criticized Beck for avoiding any kind of criticization based on race.  </p>
<p>He, like ALL the other conservative commentators, HAS to play down anyone who might bring up information regarding racial issues, because the left has been tremendously successful in demonizing anybody and everybody that vaguely hints of anything that might be critical based solely on race.  They would be run off the air if they didn&rsquo;t take that tact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Michael Savage brutally rejected the info from Amren.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure he felt that if he accepted it, his critics would harp on it constantly to the point where it would negate everything else he had to say.  </p>
<p>Savage IS of the same mindset as a lot of the people here&hellip;.at least mostly.  So is Beck and the others.  They are far closer to us than anyone would know; however, they have to choose their words carefully regarding race, and also react appropriately to anyone who even vaguely suggests something truthful about blacks, for example.</p>
<p>This country&rsquo;s elites are so terrified of losing power, money,  and position in the event of racial/civil war they&rsquo;ll go to any extent necessary to placate blacks and other non-whites, and it is they who control the media.  </p>
<p>Let me just say that when this racial facade begins to crack, because of out-of-control incidents by blacks and the situation is obvious that nothing is going to placate them but an iron fist, we&rsquo;ll all see many high profile types using harsh words for the racial situation, and it will spiral downward from there.   It began just a bit over the Gates affair.  The left wisely shut that down, because it was beginning to draw criticism against blacks by whites and I&rsquo;m pretty sure they felt it was too dangerous to their cause to let it continue.</p>
<p>The best guy we have on our side to bring pressure to bear on black anti-white racism is Barack Obama.  All he has to do is mouth another faux pas now and again like he did about the Gates affair, and our horse is off and running.  Believe me, an open, truthful conversation about blacks is NOT what the leftist radicals want.</p>
<p>Just be patient and wait.  The situation will deteriorate all on its own. Look how far downhill it has gone already.  </p>

		<p>I am a firm believer that words do mean something, as does the grammar and syntax of sentences. I am often appalled by the &ldquo;slasher film&rdquo; approach nonwhites (and blacks in particular) take with everyday language, but seeing it in print is quite another story. Often what is spoken by a nonwhite is easily deciphered by their: inflection, physical cues, and tone; however, this cannot be so easily done with written language. Thus, as an example of what should never be done when writing (i.e., rambling on in the patois of the ghetto) is this paragraph by this &ldquo;journalist&rdquo; Comrade Devona Walker:<br>
  <br>
&ldquo;Folks have criticized Blacks for being unengaged in the political process, for allowing things to happen to us, and whining. But in 2008, we increased our votes by two million people, to 64.7 percent &mdash; on par with white America and nearly 20 percent higher than other racial minorities. And now, it&rsquo;s Black activists who are trying to silence the radical racism and race-baiting on the far right so the grown folks can get back to debating policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are we to believe that blacks once &ldquo;unengaged in the political process&rdquo; even after the &ldquo;Voting Rights Act,&rdquo; now make up 64.7 percent of the total electorate and now are &ldquo;on par with white America&rdquo; which makes up about 80 to 75 percent of the vote in any given national election? Or are we to discern that blacks increased their vote by 64.7 percent in 2008? Moreover, who are the &ldquo;grown folks&rdquo; that are &ldquo;debating policy&rdquo;: black activists, Communists, illegal aliens, or all of the above? Or maybe it is none of the above? Might it not be &ldquo;grown folks&rdquo; from beyond the grave, such as George Washington or Thomas Jefferson who are debating policy; or possibly even some spacey &ldquo;grown folks&rdquo; from Andromeda Galaxy doing the same in the loop? </p>
<p>If you can make sense of that inarticulate verbal jambalaya, more power to you!</p>
<p>And as always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>I agree with ranger, pretty much hit the nail on the head. I personally don&rsquo;t have cable and accordingly have never seen Beck&rsquo;s program, but I would assume he didn&rsquo;t rise to the top by quoting Jared Taylor and the Bell Curve.  </p>
<p>Remember when Savage had an MSNBC talk show? He lasted what, like 30 minutes before letting his true feelings regarding homosexuality slip out? Instantly fired&hellip;. no second chances, no suspension. Fired instantly.  </p>
<p>At least savage had his radio program to fall back on, which he managed to keep by some miracle. But for every body else nobody is going to sacrifice their career and financial security just to rustle a few feathers. Just because Beck might criticize his guests or callers who advocate a race realist position then don&rsquo;t assume that is what he really is about. I am not saying he is or is not a covert race realist, just there is just no way in a million years he can let down his guard if he is. Nobody wants to wind up another Don Imus forced to publicly grovel at the feet of a bloated buffoonish race hustler.</p>
<p>Personally, my feelings on the matter are that it is not really about race per se. I think they are going after fox news, because from what I can tell, they show assertive, confident, strong white male type newscasters and commentators.  It is my personal belief it is not so much what they say but how they say it. </p>
<p>I think it is Blacks simply prefer to see how whites, as they are generally shown in the media: spineless, effeminate worms, who do nothing but shower heaps of undeserved praise on minorities especially on blacks themselves, and constantly wallow in self loathing and self doubt.</p>

Tom and ice:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the reason that George Soros&rsquo;s hired hands are going after Glenn Beck is not because he&rsquo;s telling the truth, but because he&rsquo;s a phony about it. If anything, blacks don&rsquo;t like two-timing and phony-baloney attitudes even more than one telling the truth about racial differences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phoney Baloney&#8221; attitudes&#8221; - Yep, that&rsquo;s it.  And if blacks can spot it, why don&rsquo;t you suppose whites can&rsquo;t?  But they do, and these guys create Leftists every time they open their mouths simply because of the unreasonability in their arguing style.  What puts me off about these guys is the transparent weakness of the way they make their cases.  Are these guys supposed to represent the white IQ acheivement?  (NO, we must recruit college educated liberals and evolution theory supporters for that statistic).  These far right pundits are like a teacher lecturing to the lowest acheiver in classroom.  They use hokum to manipulate because they really don&rsquo;t respect their audience -or potential audience.  They consistently use emotional arguments and seek to produce &#8220;buzz, words&#8221; for easy launching at their objects of derision, they use anger and hate to propel themselves.  They want to keep their jobs.  It&rsquo;s as if they are schoolyard bullies who want to attract other schoolyard bullies, not make sense.  It has gone so far that the inbreeding of thought amoung the lockstep conservatives has become painfully transparent in its errors and sources and easily argued down by the Left.  It makes it difficult for uncommitted whites to join in. </p>
<p>The truth is that no group or person is right or wrong ALL of the time.  The vainglorious postiioning of pundits and many of their followers guarantees a near 50% error and failure most of the time.  Some subtlety in complete thought processing is needed.  That and real education and information.  A good example of the lack of this on a current issue is a friend of mine who over the weekend told me that he &#8220;Doesn&rsquo;t trust the government to handle his healthcare.&#8221;  The comebacks to this are many; &#8220;But you will trust a profit driven CEO of a publicly offered investment scheme to manage yours?&#8221;  &#8220;Seniors have for 40 years for a lower cost if you consider healthcare insurance costs as taxes or the cost of the government program compared to the private &#8220;industry.&#8221;  &#8220;You would rather lobbyists buy your congressman and dictate your care and costs than have a system that you could complain to that congressman about?&#8221;  &#8220;You would rather help pay for a greedy doctor&rsquo;s Mercedes, second home and airplane than allow more doctors into the system?  (Including me).  &#8220;You would rather defeat Obama on one issue, pay icnreasing premiums and co-pays, go bankrupt when it&rsquo;s your turn to be diagnosed with a terminal disease?&#8221;  </p>
<p>I happen to believe that socialized medicine is a good thing - in a homogenous society, and THAT is the problem in America and much of the West today.</p>
<p>But perhaps I am one of the few posters on Amren who is not a CEO or black infiltrate posing as a truly concerned white.  If that were true it would not be surprising because the rationale of much of the Right these days is self-defeating. </p>
<p>While we have a right to be angry and are quite justified in it, the fact is that hate and anger wears a person down.  That is why there is a poster turnover on this website every couple years.  It is a fact that it requires more calories even to frown as opposed to smiling, more to scream than laugh, etc.  Chronic complaining leads to depression and ends up putting yet another complainer on perscription drugs or even turning them into pain killer addicts like Mr. Limbaugh.  The end result is early death after a longer period of dementia and physical incapacity.  Some white victory, eh?</p>

<p>Yes, exactly!  Without careful rehearsals, a hostile elite to pre-program the tele-prompter, staged events with rabid supporters and a complicit media, obama &#8216;raw&rsquo; is a racist and a fool (as proved by the gates incident).</p>
<p>Townhall.com reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Late Republican political strategist Lee Atwater, a brilliant Machiavellian, used to invoke what he called &#8216;The Napoleonic Maxim:&rsquo; Never interfere with the enemy when he&rsquo;s in the process of destroying himself&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There will be more, much more of the &#8216;real&rsquo; obama, especially as things don&rsquo;t go his way and his handlers&rsquo; communist plans are exposed.  Notice how obama&rsquo;s wife &#8216;the beast&rsquo; has been completely muzzled?  This is indeed unfortunate as she would greatly add to exposing the real obama what with her low IQ, racial grievances and hatred toward Whites.  Would that the American people could see what really represents them in the White House in the president and first lady.</p>

<p>I  was a bit young at the time and don&rsquo;t remember Jackie Kennedy&rsquo;s iconic pill box hats very well.  She, unlike the current first lady, was beautiful, classy and graceful and certainly did not mouth off about disliking like the country.</p>
<p>What frosts me is the pass that the press has given to michelle, the same press that excoriated Nancy Reagan and Sarah Palin for their wardrobes.  Do you remember how Sarah Palin was loudly denounced and vilified by the media 24/7 when the RNC bought her clothes for her campaign  &mdash;  clothes that she later donated to charity?  Ridiculing Sarah Palin, especially her appearance, became the media&rsquo;s obsession.</p>
<p>Time magazine featured an entire article entitled &#8220;Nancy Reagan&rsquo;s Little Rule&#8221;, about Mrs. Reagan&rsquo;s designer clothing and the fact that she was wearing them &#8216;during the 1981 recession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8221;..TIME reported that the First Lady had failed to disclose the borrowing of lavish designer outfits, a practice she had promised to stop six years ago&hellip;Mrs. Reagan&rsquo;s failure to report the loans of dresses violates a 1982 agreement &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet michelle obama can wear a $540 pair of shoes made by haute French designer Lanvin during a trip to a food bank and Not A Peep comes from the media.  Can you imagine if Sarah Palin, Mrs. Reagan or Mrs. Bush (I or II)  did this?  They would have been excoriated by the press 24/7 for their heartlessness when the unemployment rate is approaching 10%, the country is in the midst of an on-going depression and people are struggling to put food on the table.  Suggestions  would have been made that the $540 would have been better spent &#8216;supporting the food bank&rsquo; and comparisons would be made to Marie Antoinette.<br>
  <br>
Later, michelle obama  &#8216;shoveled dirt at a tree planting while wearing designer Lavin&rsquo;s chiffon tank. Dresses and strappy pumps cost upward of $1,500, while tops go for $400 to $1,000&rsquo;  Again nothing from the press, another pass.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been muzzled all right, and I assume obama is busy being coached by his handlers during his vacation so he doesn&rsquo;t stray too far again from the script that&rsquo;s been written for him.</p>
