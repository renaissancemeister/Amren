			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk (Virginia) Examiner, August 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While this is the first known instance of a U.S. soldier working as an assassin for the drug cartels, this may simply be a consequence of the evolving threat posed to this country by the cartels, as well as a result of the criminal gang activity which now exists in the U.S. military.</p>
<p>In April 2009, the FBI released a statement on the growing problem of gangs in the military, and the threat they now pose to U.S. police officers. What follows is an excerpt from that statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gang members with military training pose a unique threat to law enforcement personnel because of the distinctive military skills that they possess and their willingness to teach these skills to fellow gang members. While the number of gang members trained by the military is unknown, the threat that they pose to law enforcement is potentially significant, particularly if gang members trained in weapons, tactics, and planning pass this instruction on to other gang members.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} However, FBI gang investigator Jennifer Simon said in a recent article: &#8220;Gang membership in the U.S. Armed Forces is disproportional to the U.S. population.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prevailing estimate among most experts is that out of every 100 people who enter the military, at least two are gang members.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the increasing number of gang members joining the military, is the fact that the lowering of recruiting standards, mainly by the Army. Of course, this is due to the two wars dragging on in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>According to the Michael D. Palm Center at the University of California, between 2003 and 2006, recruiters allowed 4,230 convicted criminals into the Army.<br/>

		<p>And yet, when the problem of gangs in the U.S. Military is treated by certain sources, they show a 25 year old picture of a white FBI informant in front of a Swastika flag.</p>

		<p>Hmmm.  Filling military and law-enforcement agencies with people who hold allegiance to foreign countries, or who&rsquo;s racial and religious brothern are our enemies.  What could possibly go wrong with that plan? </p>

		<p>Here we have the FBI stating in a report of the growing threat of gang members in the military and bringing those skills back to the streets.  Wanna bet this stays a local story, yet the mainstream media went crazy over the statment by Homeland Secutity that veterans leaving the military might join right wing militias, therefore being a threat to the country.  I&rsquo;d also bet that the vast majority of these gang members in the military are Hispanic or black.</p>

		<p>Well, well, well.  According to the SPLC, it is the white supremacists who are recruiting white ex-soldiers to their cause.  I wonder why they never mentioned this?  As if I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That organization contains more liars, flakes, oddbaslls, and misfits than anything I&rsquo;ve EVER run across.</p>
<p>And it is a sad testimony to know that Fox&rsquo;s Shepard Smith and many other naive types rely on them to provide unbiased information.  Can anybody really be that stupid?</p>

		<p>Fox News is not using the SPLC as a source because they are &#8220;naive.&#8221;  They are using the SPLC as source because they have the same agenda as the SPLC.  </p>

		<p>Of course if the military screened out gang members by associations, tatoos, arrests and high school records, it would be accused of racial profiling.</p>

		<p>A recent gang prevention presentation in Florida that I attended stressed that gang members are joining the military to get experience and combat skills&hellip;there was also video of a rap concert at an army base with gang signs being thrown down&hellip;very disturbing to say the least</p>

		<p>I wonder what the neocons have to say to this! I can easily envision a Kristol or a Limbaugh saying &#8220;They&rsquo;re bad guys, but they&rsquo;re our bad guys!&#8221; Who want&rsquo;s to bet?</p>

		<p>Other readers have said it before, and I&rsquo;ll say it again:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before we have paramilitary groups of former soldiers just as South and Central America do.  Those groups rob, rape, and torture with impunity.  Generally, there is some &#8216;cause&rsquo; they&rsquo;re supposedly &#8216;fighting for&rsquo;: but their real motivation is robbery and sadistic thrills.  Hispanics seem to be exceedingly sadistic.  Any study of Pre-Columbian culture will reveal that they have always been that way.</p>
<p>Giving foreign-born Hispanics advanced weapons training almost guarantees that many of those soldiers will behave as former soldiers do in their native countries.</p>

		<p>Mexican gang bangers joining the US military is no cause for alarm.  The &#8220;combat trained&#8221; US military has been unable to pacify a handful of backward third-world Muslim primitives after nearly a decade of trying.</p>
<p>JFK said, &#8220;politicians who make peaceful change impossible, make violent change inevitable&#8221;.  Peaceful change via our so-called political election process isn&rsquo;t working, because Washington serves foreign and corporate special interest groups and not the American people.<br/>
    <br/>
America&rsquo;s tens of millions of armed civilians will soon move against all of America&rsquo;s internal enemies and traitors and anyone who stands in their way will be mowed down like a tornado through a wheat field&hellip;<br/>

		<p>I think that among those over 4,000 convicted criminals a pretty good percentage of them were convicted of what is called &#8220;petty&#8221; crime or youthful indiscretion! So-called. It can be argued that NO crimninal should be allowed into the military, especially gang members, but we live with what we have at the moment. And a bunch of recruits too have been allowed in that MAY VERY WELL BE GANG MEMBERS BUT HAVE NO ARREST OR CONVICTION RECORD! As for learning weapons, tactics, the plain and ordinary use of violence, etc., most of those gang members probably learn more on the street that they could ever learn from the military.</p>
