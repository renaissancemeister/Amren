			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, August 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Jesse Jackson has inherited the title of prince of the Ivory Coast kingdom of Sanwi from the late Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>The American pastor and onetime presidential candidate was honoured at a ceremony with Amon N&rsquo;Douffou V, king of the Agni people of the Krindjabo kingdom.</p>
<p>The crowning ceremony was attended by bare-chested women.</p>
<p>The king rules over a million members of his tribe, which venerates Michael Jackson after making him their prince after he visited the kingdom in 1992.</p>
<p>Villagers deep in the rainforest launched a search for a successor to the singer who was crowned prince of the Agni people 17 years ago.</p>
<p>The tribe held an extravagent two-day royal funeral for Michael Jackson. Traditional dancers and lookalikes of the dead singer paraded before the king and 2,000 mourners.</p>
<p>Tribal chiefs appealed to the US embassy to press Jackson&rsquo;s family to bring his body to the west African country for a burial in accordance with the local tradition of the Sanwi kingdom.</p>
<p>Jesse Jackson was on a three-day visit to the Ivory Coast, invited by the association of &#8220;Young Patriots&#8221;, who are supporters of President Laurent Gbagbo.</p>
<p>He found himself feted by the tribe and has now inherited the the title of prince  &mdash;  or son  &mdash;  of the Agni from the late star, who was not a relation.</p>
<p>Krindjabo lies deep in the tropical rainforest in the southeast of Ivory Coast. Most people survive by subsistence farming or hand-panning for gold.</p>
<p>The crowning ceremony attended by bare-chested women.</p>

		<p>Good, hopefully Jackson will stay and govern in the Ivory Coast.  He&rsquo;s just as corrupt as the other African leaders. </p>

And to think, at any moment Mr. Jackson could move to Africa and become royalty and surround himself with bare-breasted beauties. Isn&rsquo;t this THE DREAM of African Americans?</p>
<p>That Mr. Jackson choses to stay in the US goes to show which country he sees as being the most desirable. </p>
<p>Even being crowned a prince in mother Africa isn&rsquo;t enough to leave &#8216;racist&rsquo; America behind.<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t there something in the Constitution about accepting foreign titles,and foreign emoluments?????</p>
<p>If there is,I don&rsquo;t suppose that some administration in the distant future,when sanity has once again prevailed,can try Jackson <i>in absentia</i> for treason,could they???</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m dreaming,but if I&rsquo;m going to dream,I&rsquo;m going to dream big.</p>

Well why not? The United States held a televised (endlessly) extravagant two-WEEK proxysism of grief and outpouring of veneration, love and tears on the passing of this child-molesting &#8220;African Prince&#8221; of the subsistance-farming rainforest&hellip; (Are any of his &#8220;people&#8221; going to inherit any of his estate?)</p>

		<p>Bare-chested women? Jesse looks like he&rsquo;s having a good time, on the photo!</p>
<p>I think he might as well stay in Africa. Really! I mean, I don&rsquo;t see any meaningful contribution he could have made to American society, so it,s not like you desperately need him. Plus, I guess Jesse would find his new life in Africa, rather enjoyable.</p>

		<p>Yes, reports like this about Africa explain so much about African Americans. Now compare Ivory Coast (and they did what in science thousands of years ago?) with medieval France or ancient Greece or Byzantium.</p>

		<p>It looks like he is trying really hard not to look.  You know if they would take M.J.&rsquo;s body over there to be buried, then the tourist attraction or shrine would not be HERE, and maybe more would go over there and fall in love with their ROOTS and stay!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think Jesse Jackson would have a good time on the Ivory Coast, even counting the obvious carnal pleasures.  After all, which white corporations in the Ivory Coast would you be able to shake down for donations, money and beer distributerships for your idiot kids?  If you tell a black candidate for President of that country that you want to cut his n**s off, you wouldn&rsquo;t be laughed at, you would be the one facing that kind of fate.</p>

		<p>Would a real man of God attend a ceremony with bare chested women? Would he accept a title that crowns him as a prince, even if it is in a foreign land? Aren&rsquo;t Christian men, especially one who has the title of Reverend, suppose to maintain a humble attitude and not act according to worldly ways? One thing for Jesse though, he doesn&rsquo;t do a very convincing job of trying to pretend that he&rsquo;s not a phony. </p>

One has NOTHING to do with the other? Apparently, you know nothing about Jesse being an ordained Baptist minister, and the obligations and responsiblities that are suppose to go with it. If you do, you sure give Jesse alot of leeway in his behavior for a minister. Is he suppose to be a man of the Christian faith, a believer in God or not? It sure doesn&rsquo;t look like it. If he wants to act this way, it is his right, but if so, then why doesn&rsquo;t he give up his beliefs if he wants to engage in this behavior. You can&rsquo;t have it both ways. But according to your standards, it is ok for an ordained minister to hang around topless women and accept worldly entitlements that give glorification to self. You sound like a good ultra-liberal!</p>
<p>With so many other things on which to criticize Jesse, you have to focus on a comment, made by another poster here, that you have taken out of context, when the whole point of the comment to begin with was to show a man acting in a way that is vain-glorious, contrary, and way too worldly, for a professed believer and ordained minister of the Christian faith. </p>
