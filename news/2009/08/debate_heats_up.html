<h1>Debate Heats Up Over Renaming of Dallas Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Pickett, CBS11-TV (Fort Worth), August 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The debate to rename two Dallas schools after President Barack Obama and newly sworn-in Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor is heating up.</p>
<p>Much of the focus has been on the call to add Mr. Obama&rsquo;s name to a much-loved south Dallas school. DISD school board trustee Ron Price called for the change to Billy Earl Dade Learning Center to Barack Obama Middle School.  However, former educators like Wilber Williams said a tribute to the President shouldn&rsquo;t be made at the expense of a pillar of south Dallas&rsquo; education community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Overwhelmingly, the parents and the kids said we want Barack Obama and when you see those kids eyes, their eyes just started glowing, and even the parent&rsquo;s eyes were glowing just for the fact that their kid would one day go to the Barack Obama school,&#8221; Price said.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn&rsquo;t been much debate over the selected Sotomayor school.<br>

		<p>This is one issue where I agree with the blacks. If a school district is all or mostly black, why name it after a white person?</p>
<p>Of course, you can make the argument that these schools were created by whites, are still mostly funded by white taxpayers and that the whites whose names are being erased were more important than the blacks being honored.</p>
<p>But no whites make these arguments in a public forum so what do we expect?</p>
<p>Besides, given the performance and problems of these black schools, would those whites being honored (all of whom are now dead) want to be associated with the current institution? It is much more galling and embarrassing to me to see black students and teachers   &mdash;   racist to a man   &mdash;   prancing around in a school named after George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. Better for whitey if they perform their ministrations in a school named about Malcolm X, Martin Luther King or Barack Obama.</p>

		<p>I say let them rename the schools. Any school named after Barack Obama or Sotomayor is destined to have the same academic achievement levels as all schools named after MLK, Cesar Chavez, or Rosa Parks. </p>
<p>Any school named after Obams should alert parents to what school NOT to send their kids to.</p>

<p>Kids are supposed to look to grownups for guidance. Now the &#8220;grownups&#8221; are loking to kids for the guidance. As long as their black, change the name to obama whatever. </p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t do it to white schools. Let the White kids know that they&rsquo;re still children and adults don&rsquo;t follow the lead of chidren.</p>

<p>You forgot in the country of Obama on planet Obama.  At this rate, if there are any intelligent civilizations &#8220;out there,&#8221; far far away, (because there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much intelligent civilization around these parts), they might aim their dishes in our direction and wind up being mistaken that we named our insignificant little average ole star &#8220;Obama&#8221; and not &#8220;Sun.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Have those in the school write a five paragraph essay(in clear and proper English) on who Sontamayor is and why she deserves to be the person the school is named after. Anyone who uses the word Hispanic never graduates High School. After all, President Obama has said we want our minority students to meet high standards and to take tough courses. Oh yeah.</p>

I would have no problem if blacks wanted to name a school after any black person of their choice ON THE CONDITION they allow us to name our schools after whites. So long as we are denied that right, they should be too.</p>
<p>And another thing. We are constantly being told that we have to name this, that, and that other thing after a black person because it would give black children pride and raise their achievement.</p>
<p>WHEN HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED???</p>
<p>How many schools and public buildings are named after blacks and how many of those names on those buildings have done anything to raise black achievement? We were told the same thing regarding Obama. We were told that we should vote for him and everything would magically change for the better for blacks. Has it happened anywhere?</p>
<p>Chicago is having record numbers of black on black murders. Here in Buffalo, in the last two weeks, I&rsquo;ve lost count. And the victims are not always black:</p>

		<p>In Obama&rsquo;s case, I think this would be very premature. I mean, it hasn&rsquo;t been a year, since he was elected. And, who knows? he may end up, one day, being despised, like Carter or W.</p>
<p>Now, about Sotomayor&hellip; Why should a school be named in her honor? I mean, what has she done, aside from benefitting from affirmative action? She&rsquo;s in no way what I would call a great achiever, and in a few months, nobody will think about her, anymore&hellip;</p>

		<p>There may be a a more practical side to this movement.  A college application indicating graduation from BHO High School may be a good way to suggest to the admissions board that the applicant is deserving of special consideration, even though he/she is obviously functionally illiterate and not educated above 10th grade levels.  This is the way the Affirmative Action game is played these days.</p>

		<p>As usual, blacks are all about style, not substance (style IS substance to them).</p>
<p>I remember the full name of the man my elementary school was named after, and none of us students ever thought to even ask who the guy was or what he&rsquo;d done. I still have no idea. I got a good elementary education there though.</p>
<p>(Of course, if I&rsquo;d been a smarter little boy, it would have occurred to me to wonder how schools got named after someone. But like most kids, I just took things for granted. Including that I was expected to respect the teacher and follow her instructions.)</p>

		<p>Whites who have passively accepted the intentional reduction of their formerly 90% majority standing will be seeing more and more of this sort of cultural cleansing in the years to come.  Our streets, cities, schools, and geographical features were named after our own cultural icons.  As those we allow to displace us grow in power and numbers, their cultural icons will become more important than our own, and they will simply replace them.</p>
<p>Cultural cleansing is a power play, intended to make a very visible statement of change to the entrenched majority.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sickening shame that so many of our people fail to understand the message.</p>

		<p>As a matter of practice, schools should never be named after a living person.  No one knows what illegal activities this person may be involved in.  It is much less embarrassing not to name a school after a crook than to have to change the name afterwards.</p>

<p>The Sun (oops, I mean Star Obama) is bluish-green when viewed from a distance and outside an atmosphere, the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere tends to scatter light to make the sun look Yellowish at noon and then reddish near sunrise and sunset.  Blue-green is almost mocha colored, like the President who inspired to renaming of our humble star.</p>

		<p>Well, what it all boils down to is that whites are physically afraid of blacks. And probably have reason to be. But that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s never discussed, only the evil of those who show fear. </p>
<p>Then the media and schools must make sure we are morally afraid of them as well. </p>

Any Obama school will just be code for low IQ and even the libs will snicker when the name is mentioned on any resume.</p>

		<p>Obviously, those pushing to change the names of the schools to Obama and Sotomayor, are trying to kill 2 birds with one stone: 1.to further deny the real achievements of whites in building to this country to the richest, most powerful,most technology advanced country ever, and 2.to fabricate the greatness of non-whites who have not accomplished anything other than use their race and or ethnic group, to attain very high positions in our government. </p>

		<p>I grew up in the Dallas ISD. Until the late 1980&rsquo;s, even laboring under a federal judicial hate panel of anti-White watchdogs, it still managed to provide an excellent education to all who came. There were standards, discipline, order, and opportunity. Today, the HS I attended is 100% non-white. I think overall, the district is 90% White, but when you take out the elementary schools, that does it for the Whites, and their civilizing influence. I believe they are handing out rape whistles to female teachers in MIDDLE SCHOOLS in DISD. Completely appropriate to name those schools after the blacks and Hispanics who caused the destruction of American education. </p>
<p>If I had the means, I would offer a 1 million dollar prize to anyone who could find a single DISD High School Senior who could summarize the Illiad, Macbeth, explain the pythagorean theorum, and list the scientific contribution of Newton, Einstein and Galileo. My money would be quite safe. </p>

		<p>Naming a school after a black man does as much good to the school as naming a street after Martin Luther King. We all know how many folks like to promenade down MLK Ave, pushing baby buggies, and carrying large amounts of cash.<br>
     I was hird to represent a few grads of the Bedford Forrest Elementary School, a school in a nearby jurisdiction. No local lawyer over there dared to get involved. The recently black controlled school board wanted to change the name to the Chafee Academy. A fine tribute to a great Amercian hero who they thought would make the change a breeze.<br>
     I argued that Forrest had done more for blacks than Chafee did. Forrest led a protest in Memphis to have black sanitation workers paid the same as whites. He argued before the Tennessee Supreme Court that blacks should be lawyers. He was an ex-facto chairman of the largest Civil War Union black veterens group.<br>
     When I provided proof of these things, the chairman said that most folks would never know those things and all believe that Forrest was an unrepented racist and we must respect their feelings. It got pretty quiet when I said,isn`t this board supposed to be teaching people the truth and not supporting false hoods? I lost of course and the paper called me a blatent advocate for red neck racists and Klansmen without hoods.<br>
     I wrote a response where I challenged them to print my entire presentation and let their readers make up their own minds. Of course they didn`t and they didn`t print my response either. Two years later that paper went broke and I sent the editorial staff a case of Rebel Yell and signed the card Nathan Bedord Forrest .<br>

		<p>  Isn&rsquo;t it a little early to be naming a School after President Obama? The more I think about the Obama presidency the more I&rsquo;m convinced that Obama is better qualified to be president of Harvard or Yale than the United States.

<p>I did check to see if the errors of usage above are typos or if they appeared in the original aticle - which they did.  If we continue on our present downhill mudslide with regard to education, we&rsquo;ll see a lot more of this.  Here&rsquo;s the scoop:</p>
<p>Try using:</p>
<p>kids&rsquo; (the possessive plural)</p>
<p>parents&rsquo; (the possessive plural)</p>
<p>I shudder to think what things will be like in 50 years. At least, I won&rsquo;t be around then, no matter how well preserved I am now.</p>
