			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brendan Scott, New York Post, August 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The beleaguered Democratic governor in a radio interview this morning blamed his troubles on a racist media that he said has taken part in an &#8220;orchestrated&#8221; effort to get him out of office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I submit that the same kind of treatment that (Gov.) Deval Patrick is receiving right now in Massachusetts, and I&rsquo;m receiving; the way in which the New York State Senate was written about, calling them a bunch of people with thick necks  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re talking about (Senate President) Malcolm Smith and (Senate Democratic Leader) John Sampson  &mdash;  that we&rsquo;re not in the post-racial period,&#8221; Paterson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is that the next victim on the list and you see it coming is President Barack Obama, who did nothing more than try to reform a health care system that&rsquo;s not ten percent of GDP and will be 20 percent of GDP in the next four years only because he&rsquo;s trying to make change,&#8221; the governor continued.</p>
<p>The governor also lashed out at the media in his remarks on to AM1600 WWRL talk show host Errol Louis.</p>

<p>Paterson is trying to capitalize on the political divisions by invoking health care. He&rsquo;s thinking that if he can distract from the real issue and garner some of the socialist support that he can save himself. Not a bad tactic, really.</p>

		<p>Well, he&rsquo;s black and he&rsquo;s handicapped, so he has the race card and the disabled card to play.  He&rsquo;s legally blind.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s playing the race card right now.  I have even less respect for blacks, if that&rsquo;s possible, because they&rsquo;ve been elected to office recently quite often, do a lousy job, then complain that the electorate wants them out, because they&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if this Patterson is ousted from office then applies for another job as a bus driver and claims he was denied emnployment because he&rsquo;s black.</p>

		<p> Paterson did not say his critics had &#8220;thick necks&#8221;. He noted that reporters had referred to the NY State senate as having thick necks and Paterson absurdly claimed they were talking about black pols.</p>
<p>Later in the article the NY Gov claimed the liberal media were biased against Obama. That was pretty funny.</p>

		<p>In New York State, the office of Governor and Lieutenant Governor are semi-separate offices, in that there are separate primaries for Gov and LtGov, but once the nominations happen, the Democrats nominated for Gov and LtGov run together, ditto every other party.  Therefore, if you vote in NYS Gubernatorial elections in November, you vote for the Governor and the Lt. Gov. rides along.  </p>
<p>This is slightly different than some states, where the party nominees for Governor choose a running mate.  Most states that have a Lt. Gov elect them separately from Gov.  Meaning you can have a G and LG of different parties, as is the case right now in Missouri.</p>
<p>As for Gov. Paterson, I think all this is a visceral reaction to the fact that he only became Governor because Eliot Spitzer couldn&rsquo;t keep it in his pants.  With that, I tend to think that that whole scandal was a dug up trumped up affair b/c Wall Street got their revenge on the man who was once known as the &#8220;Sheriff of Wall Street&#8221; when he was Attorney General.</p>

		<p>The sad thing is when Patterson speaks on the issues directly (I&rsquo;ve heard him on the radio numerous times) he is frequently quite sensible.  But then he throws in the race card and all of a sudden he sounds like a spoiled child.  When he first took office someone refered to him as the &#8220;accidental governor&#8221;.  He said that was a racist statement despite the fact that he was (and is) an accidental governor!  No one elected him governor.  Instead of using fate to his advantage he just cries racism.  Crying when you hold the state&rsquo;s highest office doesn&rsquo;t come across well.</p>

		<p>Dear Paterson-<br>
We will NEVER be in a &#8216;post-racial&rsquo; America until blacks stop raping, robbing, murdering, attacking, harassing and assaulting every other race in this country at the alarming rates they do.  Never.<br>

		<p>I truly do hope that the legions of sanctimonious, White egalitarians are taking all this in and strating to see the undeniable trends - criticize a Black&hellip;you are racist; criticize illegal immigration&hellip;you are a zenophobe; criticize foreign policy in the middle-east&hellip;you are either an Anti-Semite, or Islamophobe, depending which side you ask. </p>
<p>This whole script is getty REALLY old and tired, and I would presume(or at least hope), more and more transparent to even the most ideologically blinded or clueless among us. </p>

		<p>As it happens so often - whenever an incompetent is shown up as incompetent he blames it not on himself, but on racism.<br>
Maybe if he got his job through hard work and not affirmative action, he wouldn&rsquo;t be so sensitive about his qualifications for the job.</p>

It&rsquo;s funny but as a New York state resident who is very racially aware, I haven&rsquo;t noticed any overt or covert racial attack on Gov. Paterson.</p>
<p>Most people consider him an accidental gov. after Spitzer resigned. I haven&rsquo;t heard anyone attack him in a racial manner.</p>
<p>There have been a couple hilarious skits of Gov. Patterson on Saturday Night Live that joked about his poor eyesight.</p>
<p>I believe this is another example of thin black skin. Blacks automatically assume that any criticism or jokes are the result of racism.</p>
