	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gates, the self-defined &#8220;black man in America&#8221;, should consider the plight of a white man in South Africa, a game farmer by the name of Ettienne van Wyk. He was arrested by some black policemen for transporting his animals without a permit. He and his farm manager, Mr. Zacharia Duvenhage, were tossed into a cell with 14 hardened black criminals: murderers, robbers, rapists. At around 3.00 a.m. Van Wyk was sodomized by some of the inmates, while the others sang songs to drown out his screams. During this impromptu a capello performance, the station commander was sound asleep.</p>
<p>Van Wyk later sued the South African minister of police for R1.2 million or $150 000 in damages. Duvenhage, who was not sodomized, sued for only R350 000 or $44 000 for suffering several minor injuries.</p>
<p>Why is this, another incident, so many thousands of miles away, relevant? Because the case of Van Wyk represents something like the mirror image of Louis Henry Gates&rsquo;s minor spat with the law. He, &#8220;a black man in America&#8221;, was arrested and taken to the police station by a white policeman painfully conscious of his duty as an enforcer of the law. He suffered no injury, except to his zeppelin of an ego. Yet the global media lavished more attention on Gates, a self-confessed creation of affirmative action, than on the war in Afghanistan and a few other wars combined. In contradistinction, the liberal champions of racial justice and equality will never spare a thought, let alone a minute of prime time, for Ettienne van Wyk, a white man arrested for a minor offence concerning the transport of his own animals and sexually assaulted by black criminals while under the authority of a black policeman.</p>

		<p>A scarcely noticed horror that&rsquo;s accompanied the integration of jails along with the rest of society is that now the de facto sentence of many white prisoners is to be gang-raped by blacks.</p>
<p>This cruel and far-too-usual punishment is visited not only upon whites convicted of some crime, major or minor, but on those jailed overnight and then released when bail is posted, or charges are dropped.</p>
<p>To its credit, the left organization Human Rights Watch published (I believe in 2006) a report on male rape in prisons, entitled &#8220;No Escape  &mdash;  Male Rape in U.S. Prisons,&#8221; which discusses the high occurrence of black on white rape in contrast to other prison rape:</p>
<p>&#8220;Past studies have documented the prevalence of black on white sexual aggression in prison.(213) These findings are further confirmed by Human Rights Watch&rsquo;s own research. Overall, our correspondence and interviews with white, black, and Hispanic inmates convince us that white inmates are disproportionately targeted for abuse.(214) Although many whites reported being raped by white inmates, black on white abuse appears to be more common. To a much lesser extent, non-Hispanic whites also reported being victimized by Hispanic inmates&hellip;Other than sexual abuse of white inmates by African Americans, and, less frequently, Hispanics, interracial and interethnic sexual abuse appears to be much less common than sexual abuse committed by persons of one race or ethnicity against members of that same group.&#8221;</p>
<p>The entire report is at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report.html</a></p>
<p>and the section that deals specifically with black on white male rape (scroll down to section &#8220;Race and Ethnicity&#8221;) is at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report4.html#_1_27" rel="nofollow">https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report4.html#_1_27</a></p>
<p>The de facto sentence of many blacks convicted of raping white women is a lengthy pass to continue raping whites who, for the greater convenience of the black predators, are now placed into their cages like hamsters fed to snakes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a very interesting audio account of one man&rsquo;s narrow escape in a New Orleans jail not very long after integration came to the South:</p>

		<p>I followed the editor&rsquo;s link, and read the full story.  But, as usual, important background information is missing.  I wonder about the situation behind the farmer&rsquo;s failure to obtain a permit to transport his animals.</p>
<p>Considering that renewals of gun permits for rural South African Farmers are becoming more and more difficult to obtain, I would assume that animal transport permits are also seen by black bureaucrats as opportunities for the harrasment of whites.  Are white farmers required to pay bribes for the permits?  Does the permit process alert would-be robbers that the farmer&rsquo;s animals (and truck) are soon to be on the road, and therefore ripe for plundering?  Are truck-loads of animals simply confiscated? </p>
<p>Does the enumeration of animals to be transported invite a raid on the farm?  Does notice that the farmer will be away from home place his home and family at risk of home invasion, or even a takeover by squatters?</p>
<p>It would be so nice is someone could supply that information.  My guess is that the only way a farmer can safely and profitably transport his animals is to risk transporting them without a permit.  But the author, of course, does not tell us this.  Newspaper articles seldom give us enough relevant information, which is why I do not buy newspapers.</p>
