			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katie Nelson, Breitbart, August 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A New Jersey blogger facing charges in two states for allegedly making threats against lawmakers and judges was trained by the FBI on how to be deliberately provocative, his attorney said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hal Turner worked for the FBI from 2002 to 2007 as an &#8220;agent provocateur&#8221; and was taught by the agency &#8220;what he could say that wouldn&rsquo;t be crossing the line,&#8221; defense attorney Michael Orozco said.</p>
<p>&#8220;His job was basically to publish information which would cause other parties to act in a manner which would lead to their arrest,&#8221; Orozco said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have acknowledged that Turner was an informant who spied on radical right-wing organizations, but the defense has said Turner was not working for the FBI when he allegedly made threats against Connecticut legislators and wrote that three federal judges in Illinois deserved to die.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He wrote in Internet postings the same month that the Illinois federal appeals judges &#8220;deserve to be killed&#8221; because they issued a ruling that upheld ordinances in Chicago and suburban Oak Park banning handguns. He included their photos and the room numbers of their chambers at the courthouse.</p>

		<p>There is a long history of government infiltrators and spies committing violence in the name of &#8220;right wing extremist groups.&#8221;<br>
These acts are then used to justify arresting members of the group and violating their civil liberties. The left loves this as it helps portray their enemies as evil and violent. But let the government even think of infiltrating a violent left wind group (Muslim terrorist cells, violent black supremacist sects, far-left terrorists) and we are given lectures about civil liberties and the need to monitor the government.</p>

		<p>Bernie:  There is a long history of Federal law enforcement CREATING right-wing extremist groups.  The reason they do is the same reason why Hal Turner was an A/P, (like some of us suspected all along)   &mdash;   to give the SPLC and ADL enemies so they can raise money.</p>
<p>Even if the FBI is telling the truth that Turner wasn&rsquo;t working for them when he made the threats against the judges, that dog doesn&rsquo;t hunt for me, because he only used the tactics they taught him.</p>

<p>What a disgrace.  What the government calls &#8220;radical right-wing&#8221; usually turns out to be just a group or family that wants to be left alone (ruby ridge comes to mind).  </p>

Does anyone doubt that the Southern Poverty Law Center, who just put out a major study of &#8216;right-wing hate&rsquo;, wasn&rsquo;t working with the FBI on this one?</p>

		<p>I had read his blog on occasion and often wondered how he could  escape &#8220;the authorities&#8221; wrath with his highly provocative writing style. Yes, there is still free speech in America which I highly support, but &ldquo;agent provocateurs&rdquo; are among the lowest of the low. </p>
<p>Just desserts for Hal Turner!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;His job was basically to publish information which would cause other parties to act in a manner which would lead to their arrest,&rdquo; Orozco said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turner was an amateurish scam artist, but he WAS entertaining.  I clicked onto his site occassionally just to see what he was up to.  The one blaring fact about him that made it obvious he was either a nut case or an agent provacateur was his needless extreme rhetoric.</p>
<p>For example, a person who reads him has to ask himself what the man&rsquo;s purpose is.  It was plain that only an idiot would join in anything he advocated, because he was so obviously absurd.  His tone and extremist language weren&rsquo;t necessary to promote whites and white causes.  In fact his entire ludicrous inane provocations were counterproductive.  And, he could never get more than a few dollars in donations from what I can gather, and he was enraged quite often over that.  </p>
<p>I wrote him once and asked him why he didn&rsquo;t start up an extreme left wing blog, trying to get one of them to sound off as he does, because it is those types who are causing all the violence and chaos today, with their anti-globalist and anti-capitalist agenda.  I told him it isn&rsquo;t the far right that causes problems it is the far left. I added that the reason he can&rsquo;t get donations is because it was plain to most that he was a provocateur.  Nobody else could get away with using that method of criticism but someone trying to provoke others.</p>
<p>He never answered me, but wrote a post immediately afterward which explained that his radical language was protected free speech under the constitution and cited three cases which he claimed protected him.</p>
<p>I wrote him in answer to that and said that the most telling point of his disingenuousness was his practice of such flagrant violent language which was counterproductive to advancing anyone, let alone whites.  He never answered that either.  </p>
<p>The humorous aspect to this entire man&rsquo;s sloppy endeavors is the fact that he REALLY was effective at times in protesting black on white crime, even though he made a big show of bringing skinheads at his protest.   He DID effectively highlight black on white assaults in a couple of areas that he physically protested, which, if factored into his overall efforts as a provacateur, made him on a par with Inspector Clouseau. That was an unintended consequence and it could be the reason the feds dropped him:  He was too effective for the far right and came up with zilch in the way of entrapping people to mirror his blatant violent language.</p>
<p>I believe in the end, after he was dropped by the feds, he redoubled his efforts to try to entrap some poor mentally challenged far right person in order to get back on the payroll, and he went too far in advocating violent crimes.  The comments he was finally arrested for were definitely outrageous, but, worst of all, they were so outrageous they were useless, if incitement was the intended purpose.  The only people I&rsquo;ve ever  read that get that verbally extreme are the far left, and they don&rsquo;t do it as blatantly as Turner.</p>
<p>He should have switched over as a leftist provacateur and he would have had some success.  I don&rsquo;t think even the skinheads get as radical as he does.  Certainly people interested in strictly advancing white causes want nothing to do with the likes of him.</p>
<p>However, I have to admit I&rsquo;m going to miss going to his blog for a laugh now and then.</p>

		<p>So Hal Turner was a traitor? He set up White people so the FBI could arrest them?  Is this why they want those hate crime laws so bad so as to get the WN all arrested for their so-called speech &#8220;crimes&#8221;? Freedom of Speech has been lost in this country for decades and is now rearing it&rsquo;s ugly head for all to see. Now the question is, are we going to tolerate it?</p>

		<p>   I used to read the Hal Turner Show every long now and again and I always knew he was a strange character. There was rumours of him being a fed, but I never paid him much attention anyways. The one thing I would always joke about is how he begged for money and tried to lecture people into supporting the cause with donations&hellip;.what a joke!</p>

		<p>Agents provocateur are easy to sniff out.  All it takes is the desire, plus common sense; you create and live by a code that agents provocateur cannot, by definition, adhere to, and label as agent provocateur anyone who doesn&rsquo;t adhere to it.</p>

		<p>Hal Turner correctly predicted the economic collapse of last<br>
Oct down to the week, and stated the reasons it would happen, such as derivative 3 years before it did happened. Hal pointed out before anyone I know how the FED would be stopping the report of M3. M3 is the only way we or foreign buyers of dollars can know how much of the green stuff is out there. <br>
I really wish the Economist had provided as much foresight. <br>
He on the other hand was a performer, and a real ham, so, probability tricked himself into a false sense of invulnerability.</p>

		<p>This is a warmed over version of CoIntelPro. Look it up on Wikipedia. This also reminds me of the stunts Canada&rsquo;s CSIS pulled by building up the country&rsquo;s largest neo-nazi organization under government agent Grant Bristow. Lest anyone think this conspiracy theory nonsense they should note that Grant Bristow was publicly outed, admitted it and went into hiding.</p>
<p>The basic govt strategy is to use agents to infiltrate and BUILD UP organizations. And then use provocateurs to incite its members to engage in illegal activities. The goal isn&rsquo;t so much to arrest those on the edge as to RADICALIZE the organizations. By radicalizing the orgs they undermine public support and discredit previously mainstream views. The worst part comes when remaining supporters are frozen because they don&rsquo;t know whom to trust. In the case of govt agent Bristow, his front organization tried to take over the Reform Party in it&rsquo;s formative years and then <i>conveniently</i> leaked the story at an inopportune time. In other words, politicians were using a bogus hate group to undermine potential political opponents. Now, does anyone wonder how things in the west have gotten so screwed up?</p>
<p>Any legitimate org would do well to keep a close eye out on two types. The first type is the guy who is just a little too radical. And the second type is the guy who is just a little too <i>perfect</i>. I recommend sending someone to polygraph school because even if YOU are legit there is no guarantee that the govt is.</p>

		<p>Instead of doing something about the many criminals, terrorists, and illegal immigrants in this country, the FBI, CIA, and the &#8220;American&#8221; government would rather spy on white Americans and provoke the mentally unstable into committing crimes, so that they can vilify the law-abiding whites and attempt to take away their right to free speech and bear arms.</p>
<p>Just think, if these criminals had spent less time creating Hal Turners and more time actually doing their jobs, 3000 more Americans might have been alive on September 12, 2001.</p>

		<p>I had a friend turn me onto Hal Turner a couple years ago. From the get-go, I knew there was something very off about this man. He was right from time to time, but represented himself in such a manner that would leave a bad taste in just about anyone&rsquo;s mouth. </p>
<p>Hal&rsquo;s &#8220;connections&#8221; are no surprise. You have to think twice about someone that calls for violence against judges and lawyers, and later, against underage kids that harassed him over the phone. </p>
<p>What instantly turned me off from Hal were his incessant complaints of non-funding. You can&rsquo;t take anyone like that seriously. Are you doing it for money, or are you doing it to further a cause? He&rsquo;d then go on to insult his listeners that didn&rsquo;t send him a petty donation. </p>
<p>Folks, I advise you to be very, very apprehensive of anyone that speaks &#8220;for us&#8221; and openly advocates violence. This should be a red-herring to even the dullest intellect. </p>
<p>All that said, I hope Hal is &#8220;visited&#8221; by the people he pretended to hate while he&rsquo;s in the pen. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bet the gov&rsquo;t infiltrates them anyway&hellip;the gov&rsquo;t certainly infiltrated the left in the years of the old Communist Party, and in the Nixon years when the radical New Left was so active.</p>
<p>In NYC in the late 60s there was a guy called &#8220;Crazy George,&#8221; the most radical guy around, who made friends and joined efforts with a tiny group who had taken to setting off bombs in corporate buildings at night&hellip;.after the group was arrested, it turned out that &#8220;Crazy George&#8221; had been working for the FBI the entire time he&rsquo;d been on the left, encouraging people to get machine guns, and do every kind of crazy thing imaginable.</p>

		<p>So the FBI is causing violence against people! The agency that once was worthy of respect is leading people to commit crime, so the discredited agency can arrest them and say &#8220;see, you Whites are racist!&#8221;<br>
The once-great &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; agency has been seriously compromised. This now-disgraced federal agency should be replaced by something that is worthy of respect.</p>

		<p>Pay attention folks. I think 99% of Amren readers would have the good sense not to take guns to a protest rally of Obama. Let&rsquo;s see what we know. All of the sudden several UNIDENTIFIED men show up at protest rallies carrying guns.The one toting an AR-15 is black.? (How many Blacks in this country do not support Obama?7 or 8 I think). <br>
I assure you if you get within an undefined range of the POTUS the Secret Servce will arrest you. They may not even charge you but they will take custody of you until the President is long gone. But, most likely they will charge you and break you financially. <br>
Some of that is justified they are charged with Protecting the President and if you make their job hard ..well..they will make your life hard.<br>
The left is trying to prime the pumps for a bunch of right wing extremest to do extreme things to force the Goverment to respond in extreme measure regarding all of our civil rights not just 2nd amendment rights.   </p>

He was made an example of because we live in a time when our Constitutional rights are routinely trampled upon in the name of political correctness. He merely voiced his opinions, radical as they were, but did nothing illegal. I hope his lawyers stick with him and in the end sue those who prosecuted him for millions.</p>

<p>It was worse than that.  The leader of the Canadian Nazi Party (now there&rsquo;s an oxymoron) was left-wing and Jewish.  Would not have surprised me if there wasn&rsquo;t one real Nazi in the Nazi Party.</p>
<p>Also, I think you&rsquo;re right about Von Brunn.  The UK Daily Mail (of all sources) confirmed than an FBI &#8220;informant&#8221; was swinging between Von Brunn and the FBI, and tried to swing his way through the conservative race groups.  The Mail said his name, but I won&rsquo;t say it here.  What I will say is that if you are looking to assign blame for what an 89-year old man did (like 89-year old men have the ability to do anything), look at this particular person.</p>

		<p>I am someone who listened to Hal&rsquo;s show and donated to his show. I was shocked and saddened when I heard his lawyer say that he was workinh with the FBI. I do believe that Hal believes what he was saying on his shows. He is playing both sides though. Hal could really fire people up. He held several rallies in defense of Whites including a rally to bring attention to Channon Christian and Chris Newsome in Knoxville. Hal&rsquo;s speech was amazing. It&rsquo;s sad that he was working with the FBI. BUt something in my opinion is fishy about this story.</p>

		<p>Prosecutors have acknowledged that Turner was an informant who spied on radical right-wing organizations, but the defense has said Turner was not working for the FBI when he allegedly made threats against Connecticut legislators and wrote that three federal judges in Illinois deserved to die.(FROM ARTICLE ABOVE)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Connecticut was going to start regulating the Catholic Church and their political dealings after the Church told parishioners to not vote for politicians that support abortion. Hal basically said he was going to kick some ass if Conecticut politicians did not stop harassing the Church. Connecticut backed down and stopped the piece of legislation that would have been a big blow to anti-abortionists and the Church. Every Catholic and person that is against abortion should thank Hal Turner.</p>

		<p>The best way to counter provocateurs is to never do or say anything that can be construed to be illegal. It&rsquo;s rare that anybody is harassed by the authorities, unless they scream utter nonsense and make outlandish threats as Turner did.  </p>
<p>But the bottom line is that it isn&rsquo;t necessary to do or write or say anything illegal for any reason.  </p>
<p>Why?  Because it is just plain stupid and advances nothing.  Too, this multicultural disaster is imploding all on its own.  It&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Discuss the situation, criticize it, and maintain communication with like-minded people, and BE PREPARED, but, rest assured, nothing anybody can do or say would be more effective than what is transpiring naturally all on its own.</p>

		<p>Surely, there is a place for properly structured and<br>
circumscribed communication with the FBI on the part of leaders and activists.  The Privacy Act guarantees reasonable rights to submit documents and information about oneself to be put in any personal file/s maintained by such agencies as FBI, BATFE, IRS, CIA, etc.  There is every reason to suppose that on a contracted confidential basis the FBI Behavioral Sciences Unit might very well host a series of closed-door presentations by Kevin MacDonald, Jared Taylor, Michael Levin, Phil Rushton.  I believe it naive to suppose otherwise.  If not now, within, say, five years.  The Bureau is a very big tent, and within it, especially from the agents whose fathers and grandfathers were agents, are those with personal affinities for the values of realism and respect of tradition.       </p>

Canadian Jewish Congress Organized Nazis</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neo-conservative author Ezra Levant claims in his latest book, Shakedown, that the Canadian Jewish Congress hired ex-cop John Garrity to work for the Canadian Nazi Party in the 1960&rsquo;s. In 1965 and 1966, Garrity was put in charge of membership for the group and organized the dozen or so &ldquo;rag-tag band of losers&rdquo; into an outfit that garned a lot of press coverage.</p>
<p>That media attention was used by the CJC to build up a precieved public threat that persuaded Parliament to abridge Canada&rsquo;s freedom of speech, Levant contends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&gt; The problem I see with this is that it implies that the Nazi parties are either so collectively stupid, or so desperate, that they will take on a new member and soon put him in an important office.</p>
<p>I tend to think that it is a bit of both.  Here&rsquo;s why; In the mid-1990s, I was on a particular bit of historic research where I wanted a copy of the film, &#8220;The Triumph of the Will.&#8221;  I received it from a group that sounded as if they were probably a Nazi organization based in Florida.  Not long after that, I received a letter postmarked Florida, from an anonymous group who claimed to represent a &#8220;militia&#8221; and he offered me a postion as my region&rsquo;s top officer and organizer.  Just because I ordered a copy of an old Nazi propaganda film.  They had no idea of who I was, or even if I was black and Jewish, like Sammy Davis, Jr.  That is stupid and desperate.</p>

<p>Wrong Sir. I was one of the people that donated to Hal&rsquo;s cause. He held pro-White rallies in Kalamazoo, Knoxville and in New York in defense of Whites. Hal&rsquo;s speech might have been crazy to you, but his show and website were the best in the WN movement by far. He nailed the exact month of the economic collapse and his blog was quoted in newspapers worldwide. He always talked about how whites were being butchered on the streets and he appeared on numerous shows. Including &#8220;Geraldo&#8221; on Fox, &#8220;Dateline&#8221; on NBC and he also appeared on CNN. It&rsquo;s my belief that Hal was playing the FBI for money. And besides, the last 2 years he continued his show without being on the payroll for the FBI so he clearly believed deeply in the Pro-White cause. </p>
<p>I have some of Hal&rsquo;s shows downloaded and I was listening to one the other day. He was talking about how &#8220;our birthright has been stolen from us&#8221;. He was passionate and believed in the cause. American Renaisssance is not the only point of view out there. And just because you believe he was a nut does not make it so. </p>

		<p>I think many people (myself included) find it entertaining to hear someone say things that are extremely controversial.  Howard Stern has made a fortune being controversial and pushing the envelope.  Hal Turner&rsquo;s internet show was also controversial, though in different ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure most of his listeners tuned in for the same reason I did.  Not to answer some bogus &#8220;call to arms&#8221;, but rather to hear the next outrageous thing to come flying out of his mouth.  Love him or hate him, agree with him or disagree, the guy was certainly entertaining to listen to.</p>
<p>That said, here&rsquo;s hoping that his days as an A/P didn&rsquo;t produce the desired results, and that he now receives the karma he so richly deserves for selling out some of the few remaining whites that actually still care about our race.  In my eyes, he&rsquo;s worse than a white liberal.  At least a white liberal doesn&rsquo;t hide the fact that they&rsquo;re a sell-out.  </p>

		<p>35 Ice: I think you are probably right, and I truly hope so.  Things will likely fall apart, and whatever violence may occur will be initiated by the non-Whites, just as they commit so great a disproportion of ordinary street crime.  We don&rsquo;t need to search out trouble, the trouble will come to our doors soon enough.  The cards that are showing are mostly against us, but if the USSR couldn&rsquo;t be held together by the KGB, what chance has the FBI?  And, if I understand him correctly, 40 Anon says that within the national security apparatus are elements who understand the situation and are biding their time.  That makes sense to me.  If there is a large minority among teachers who understand racial issues but lie low to keep their jobs, I can&rsquo;t imagine that there aren&rsquo;t a whole lot of cops and spooks and generals who understand these things as well.  </p>

Cynthia McKinney: Did The FBI Pay a &#8220;Journalist&#8221; in 2006 to Say That  I Should Be Lynched on My Way to Vote?</p>
<p>I am in the Bay Area and rocking with the San Francisco Bay View <br>
newspaper. But something quite insidious is happening and I think you should know immediately how it involves my friends and me.</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of my learning that the Georgia Green Party might have been described by the U.S. Government as a &#8220;terrorist <br>
organiztion,&#8221; it has just now come to my attention that a <br>
&#8220;journalist&#8221; who suggested that I be lynched was actually being paid by our own government to say that. </p>
<p>Now, when I reported it to the FBI, how in the world was I to know that he was at that time on the FBI&rsquo;s payroll? Interesting that charges stem from his comments against Connecticut lawmakers and Illinois judges, but not from the <br>
threat made against me, a sitting Member of Congress at the time! I wonder why. To whom can I or any other innocent citizen turn when the government, itself, is the instigator?</p>
<p>John Judge, my Congressional staffer, is the one who reported the threat. Here is what John just wrote, along with the article that reports that Turner was on the FBI payroll at the time the threat was made against me, according to Turner&rsquo;s attorney. See the green highlights below:</p>
<p>John Judge wrote:<br>
This is the guy who announced a program topic suggesting that Cynthia McKinney be lynched on her way to the polls to vote in 2006 and published her campaign office address on the website. He asked how she would look swinging at the end of a rope and what message it would send to other &#8220;uppity&#8221; Blacks. I called NJ Homeland Security and FBI at the time sincee related to it as a death threat. The FBI agent I spoke to said &#8220;We know all about Mr. Turner&#8221;. Looks like they did. </p>
<p>Now they say he was trained as an agent provocateur by the FBI <br>
to get others to participate in illegal acts. As Jim Garrison says in the movie JFK after interviewing Clay Shaw, &#8220;I think we got one&#8221;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to the AP Hal Turner has exposed through his attorney that he worked for the FBI from 2002 to 2007 as an &#8220;agent provocateur&#8221; and  &#8220;his job was basically to publish information which would cause other parties to act in a manner which would lead to their arrest&#8221;</p>
