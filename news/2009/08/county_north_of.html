<h1>County North of NYC to Market Housing to Nonwhites</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Fitzgerald, AP, August 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The suburban county just north of New York City agreed Monday to create hundreds of affordable homes in heavily white communities and encourage nonwhites to move in.</p>
<p>The agreement, reached with the help of the federal department of Housing and Urban Development, settles a $180 million lawsuit brought by the Anti-Discrimination Center of Metro New York against Westchester County.</p>
<p>Both sides said the agreement, which was being filed in federal court, could have far-reaching national consequences.</p>
<p>&#8220;The settlement will have a major impact on the way federal housing and community development funds are used throughout the country,&#8221; the center said.</p>
<p>Susan Tolchin, Westchester&rsquo;s deputy county executive, said, &#8220;HUD&rsquo;s new focus is to make suburbia inclusive and diverse and this is going to be what they want all communities that take funds to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westchester admitted no wrongdoing. County Executive Andrew Spano said the county had &#8220;for many years considered the impact of race on affordable housing.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the lawsuit said Westchester failed to build affordable housing and reduce segregation in some of the county&rsquo;s more affluent communities.</p>
<p>A federal judge ruled in February that Westchester failed to analyze, as required, how race could affect access to fair housing when it sought federal housing and development funds. The county said Monday that was a technicality, but the ruling apparently spurred the settlement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Westchester said it will build or acquire 750 apartments or houses in its suburban towns and villages in the next seven years. Of that number, 630 are to be built in neighborhoods that are less than 3 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whites cannot be excluded from buying the homes, but the agreement calls for Westchester to market them throughout the county and in nearby areas with large nonwhite populations, Tolchin said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The agreement also calls for Westchester to pay the federal government $21.6 million, which the government will then return to the county to help pay for the housing. An additional $10.9 million will be paid to the anti-discrimination center, its lawyers and the government.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Sam Roberts, New York Times, August 11, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Westchester County entered into a landmark desegregation agreement on Monday that would compel it to create hundreds of houses and apartments for moderate-income people in overwhelmingly white communities and aggressively market them to nonwhites in Westchester and New York City.</p>
<p>The agreement, if ratified by the county&rsquo;s Board of Legislators, would settle a lawsuit filed by an antidiscrimination group and could become a template for increased scrutiny of local governments&rsquo; housing policies by the Obama administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is consistent with the president&rsquo;s desire to see a fully integrated society,&#8221; said Ron Sims, the deputy secretary of housing and urban development, which helped broker the settlement along with the Justice Department. &#8220;Until now, we tended to lay dormant. This is historic, because we are going to hold people&rsquo;s feet to the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>A rather vague description of where this $11 million is going. But it does point out that there is profit to be made by these non profit &#8220;civil rights&#8221; organizations. All they have to do is locate a community where Jamal cannot afford to live and sue these &#8220;racists&#8221; for excluding Jamal and his homies.<br>

		<p>When will these bleeping idiots realize that this has NEVER worked ? </p>
<p>It is analagous to a perfectly healthy person being infected with just a tiny blood drop of HIV.</p>
<p>Initially there are no bad effects, but as time passes, the &#8220;results&#8221; get increasingly worse - at an increasingly quicker rate.</p>
<p>The ravages and &#8220;results&#8221; of this forced integration (a deadly spreading disease) are all over our country.</p>
<p>In just a few more generations, we will be engulfed by barrios and ghettoes - with no where to flee.</p>
<p>If you think anti-white sentiment is bad now - try to picture even 20 short years into the future. </p>

		<p>Let the diversity begin. This is about as good of a place as any to begin. (Martha&rsquo;s Vinyard, Marin County, CA, and Mercer Island, WA would also be some other good pilot project target cities) All of these places are full of white elitists who have promoted all of this business for the rest of the country for years. We can only hope that they are financially trapped in their houses.</p>

		<p>Yup, we&rsquo;ve already got that here in N.J. (they call it here Affordable housing and the differnt municipalities around the state are forced to build housing for the minorities) Leave it to N.J. to lead the way with an idiotic idea like this. </p>
<p>But the powers that be know the day of the city is past and they&rsquo;ve got to do something with the dregs who live in those cities and this is it. Spread them out into suburbia.</p>

<i>&ldquo;HUD&rsquo;s new focus is to make suburbia inclusive and diverse and this is going to be what they want all communities that take funds to do.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Is this the endgame? Will every small community with a majority white population be made diverse?</p>
<p>Of course, one way around this is to NOT take federal funds.</p>
<p>It always comes down to money and greed. Instead of being content and quiet, these fools on the city council and planning boards ask for federal money which has strings attached. It&rsquo;s a deal made with the devil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating reading about outer-ring suburbs trolling for &#8216;development&rsquo;. Forget development. Keep your integrity and small town charm. Any council member who promotes &#8216;development&rsquo; should be removed from office.<br>

~~~~~~~~<br>
Excuse me, but did I miss something along the way? I wasn&rsquo;t aware we had become a socialistic country. Since when is it the county&rsquo;s obligation to build housing?  In the USA that I grew up in, housing was built by developers to satisfy a need among those who could pay.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I can&rsquo;t afford to buy a house in Westchester County either. But then, I&rsquo;m only white.  Tough luck!</p>

		<p>A good title for this article would be &#8220;Government Exporting Crime To Suburbia&#8221;.</p>
<p>A recent episode of American Justice reported on a once lovely suburban area that had low income housing made available 30 years ago, which resulted in the creation of a gangland that now makes it a deadly place to live. Our politicos won&rsquo;t be happy until the entire country looks like Detroit. </p>

		<p>Westchester county if one of safest counties in the country. Many of the cities located in the county have never had a drug bust or murder. We can expect to see this change in the next 5 years. By the time the crime wave hits this court ruling will have been forgotten.</p>

		<p>This is insane.  Whites built these communities at great cost to themselves.  They gave up their old neighborhoods in the the 70&rsquo;s and moved out to what was once barren land.  </p>
<p>This is infuriating.  It is a serious collapse of freedom.  We will not be left alone.  These liberal judges and activist will hound us.  Once housing is built for minorities then it will be mandatory the city provide jobs for them.  Then more lawsuits will force schools provide scholarships and hand out diplomas in proportion to the population irrespective of merit.</p>

		<p>This is proof that the NAACP, Sharpton, Jackson and the other chronic complainers have no solution for solving the persistent black underclass.  All this talk of self-determination and self-governing by blacks is just talk.  They do not want to be left to themselves, they want to be with whites.  </p>
<p>Step 1. Force integration with whites.<br>
Step 2. Complain about white oppression and racism.<br>
Step 3. Reap the benefits of endless lawsuits and affirmative action<br>
Step 4. Rinse and repeat </p>

		<p>Obama wants to see a &#8220;fully integrated society&#8221;? When is the last time he lived in a black community? Also, Westchester has plenty of blacks in Mt Vernon, New Rochelle and Yonkers(which borders the Bronx). </p>
<p>Is the County govt insane? Are they going to build these low income shacks in Rye or Larchmont or up where the Clintons live? I doubt it. This will only create black v  white areas of the County. </p>
<p>So much for integration and the County, on top of paying the liberal lawyers ten million bucks, better budge a few million more for additional police and corrections facilities and personnel. </p>
<p>If Obama is going to &#8220;integrate&#8221; the suburbs which are open to blacks now who have the money to buy a home, white communities had better hire some good lawyers and litigate, litigate. Or this will never stop.</p>

		<p>These bumbling fools in government are going to continue with programs that disrupt out neighborhoods, cause interracial fighting and animosity, until they&rsquo;re brought under control somehow or until this country is no more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m proudly rooting for a nationwide collapse in the entire economic infrastructure.  If they&rsquo;re bankrupt they can do no harm, and bankruptcy will also cause the chaos that will eliminate their jobs as well.</p>

		<p>Wow, as if property values hadn&rsquo;t plummeted enough already.  Why is it so important for non-Whites to live near Whites anyway?  So they can have access to our daughters and sisters?  They really do want to erase us through a program of forced miscegenation.  I have never felt compelled to move to Chinatown or any other area where I would be a visible minority.  </p>

		<p>Fantastic!  I&rsquo;m all for it.   You can bet the residents of Westchester are all for the looniest racial programs as long as they only effect the middle class and below, and that they pat themselves on the back for not being one of those smelly racist proles.   Everyone should have to shoulder the burden of these programs, there should be no place that is exempt, no gated community, rich enclave, or apartment building that isn&rsquo;t required to host this type of housing.   &ldquo;This agreement is not focused on facilitating housing for the poorest of the poor.&rdquo;   Not good enough,  Westchester should have to take  welfare families as well.   There would have been a lot less social engineering over the last 50 years if the rich, from the upper middle class on up,  were not allowed to exempt themselves and their children from the experiments.   Next up: a look their schools, both public and private.</p>

		<p>I work in Westchester everyday&hellip;.. the local rag is called The Journal News. About 2 or so years ago there was a headline that read&hellip;.  Whites now a Minority in Westchester. It&rsquo;s already gone! The norther parts that are sparsley populated like Yorktown and Katona and Bedford are probably the whitest. But in the densley populate southern part of the county, below I-287, in areas like Yonkers, Mt. Vernon, New Rochelle is virtualy all black and hispanic. You&rsquo;d be lucky to find an English speaker. Westchest was where the white flight out of NYC went during the &rsquo;50s, &rsquo;60s, and &rsquo;70s. Today Whites move to Orange, Rockland, Dutchess, and if they can afford the property taxes, Putnam County. Thinking about Idaho about now!!!</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t providing non-whites with the opportunity to buy houses they couldn&rsquo;t afford the reason the world is in this rotten recession right now? I live in Canada, and although I&rsquo;m highly critical of the way my government and country deal with third-world immigration, one thing we did do right is keep our banks and lenders heavily regulated, which means that you can&rsquo;t buy a house unless you&rsquo;ve got the capital to afford it and keep making the mortgage payments. Where I live, Somalis have moved in (like everywhere else), but you just don&rsquo;t see them in nice white communities. That&rsquo;s because, bleeding liberal white hearts aside, they can&rsquo;t afford to move there, and that&rsquo;s probably not going to happen anytime soon.</p>
<p>Affordable housing for non-whites was what caused the current American recession/depression. Hasn&rsquo;t anybody in power realized this yet?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a resident of Westchester County and a subscriber of AmRen, and I&rsquo;m extremely disappointed by this news. </p>
<p>I would also like to respond to some of the malevolent criticisms of &#8220;white elites&#8221; from Westchester on this discussion board. Such objections are really not helpful for advancing our common goals. In this case, the lawsuit and integration program is being forced on Westchester County through a combination of pressure from the HUD, and the Anti-Discrimination Center of Metro New York. Hence, we should direct our agitation towards those institutions in a productive fashion, rather than towards white residents of Westchester, who do not deserve to have their civilized communities ripped to pieces. </p>

		<p>Disgusting forced deminishment of a nice white community&rsquo;s quality of life for the dubious sake of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Westchester can no longer hide from the ugly reality of continuing residential segregation,&#8221; </i></p>
<p>The real ugly reality that is well recognized (privately) but unfortunately not admitted publicly is that blacks commit an outrageously disproportionate amount of violent crime. Much of their youth is simply a predator class. It&rsquo;s time for more publicity on the dysfunctional and dangerous crime culture that comes with too many lower class blacks. </p>
<p>IMO it is unconstitutional for tax money to be used as a club to force nice white communities to do what the government has no authority to force them to do. Whites must recognize that blacks as a group represent essentially an dangerous adversary they must always defend themselves against and not give in to such coercion to bring high risk of harm on themselves. </p>

		<p>What is especially scary about this ruling was that there was no evidence of racial discrimination in Westchester.  Instead, the apparent US Government policy is that measures must be taken to remedy a situation where the white percentage of the population is too high in a community that takes federal housing funds.  This is left-wing social engineering at its most egregious!!!</p>
<p>So I suppose the federal government will now demand that estate homes be built in communities that are 95% black and those homes be marketed to whites.  </p>
<p>I think not.</p>
<p>Obviously, the US federal government and many other institutions have been taken over by the far-left that has inherent animosity towards whites.  We fought the wrong enemies in the Cold War as our real enemies were within our borders all along. <br>

		<p>My town of 25.000 is suffering from the same infusion of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  20 years ago, it was mostly White and lower  middle class. Now, because every apartment complex that they&rsquo;ve built in that time is for &#8220;low income&#8221;, the town has changed drastically for the worse. There is also a snowball effect going on. Long time residents are moving out to escape, which causes a vacant home, which causes HUD to step in and move in a Section 8 recipient. THe changes here are obvious. THere is one street with a stretch of 8-10 apartment buildings on it. You can drive by there on a weekday and literally see scores of nonworking adults on welfare just hanging out.</p>

		<p>I see this issue has aroused a great deal of commentary in a very short period.  There are three points have to make, which others have already commented on.  </p>
<p>1. As to hoping that many of the white liberals in this county find themselves financially strapped when this comes to pass, I would advise almost anyone to consider not owning a house for precisely this reason.  It can be a real trap.  Neighborhoods and communities that play along, or are forced to play along, with this sort of thing miss the chance to immediately impose a depleted tax base and eroding social condition on a municipality that has so richly earned that fate.  It usually takes about 10 or 20 years otherwise, allowing room to lay PC blame to other causes, when everyone obviously knows perfectly well what &#8220;went wrong&#8221; with the neighborhood. <br>
2.  Any person of any race, as a mater of federal and state law anywhere, for a generation now, may buy any house they can actually afford.  There is no law - constitution or otherwise -  that empowers the federal government to coerce residential race-mixing.  These arrangements purposefully target a low-life, heavily Section 8 element exposure to whom will not increase tolerance or anyone&rsquo;s appreciation of &#8220;diversity&#8221;; it will expose people to the worst realities, most of which are carefully avoided or simply, and systematically, lied about in media and TV land.  This could actually wake a lot of people up.  <br>
3. This is the county&rsquo;s fault.  This is a classic of the Left.  Liberals in a left-funded group sue liberals in government to &#8220;force&#8221; said liberals in the government hand-out agency to do what 100% of the &#8220;parties&#8221; to the case actually want to do anyway, but can&rsquo;t politically.  When was the last time any of these bolshevik barristers had to actually prove anything in court, under any legal authority, and some specific standard of proof, and prevail through to appeal?  They don&rsquo;t try cases; they file lawsuits, issue press-releases, enter into &#8220;settlements,&#8221; and then pat each other on the back.  It&rsquo;s disgusting, and I&rsquo;m sick of it.  </p>

		<p>In the unlikely event that there are any aspiring young journalists out there reading Amren who want to make a name for themselves, I have an idea. Please do some investigating on several avenues of inquiry. </p>
<p>1) Which politicians, judges, etc. voted for this?</p>
<p>2) Who contributed to their campaign funds? Specifically, were there any of the big corporate megadevelopers?</p>
<p>3) Ditto for the Section 8 program. What&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s history? Who supported it behind the scenes? Note: remember to look at dollars contributed to political campaigns, not words.</p>
<p>4) Are the companies involved in building the new apartments connected in any way to the new home builders? Are they selling them at cost, in order to drive whites out of perfectly good housing?</p>
<p>5) Do any of the home builders have big huge new developments, even more expensive, even further out? Are they having trouble selling their homes? </p>

<p>I have yet to hear of any formerly all-White community, where crime did not suddenly make itself noticeable, the minute Blacks and Hispanics began to &#8220;integrate&#8221; that community.</p>
<p>I saw the truth of this in the 1960s, as a youngster. When Willingboro, NJ became forcibly integrated in the aftermath of the civil rights lunacy. What was once a nice, pleasant little community started a steady decline. The shopping center on Route 130 started experiencing lots of shoplifting and vandalism. Stores quickly fled. In a few short years graffiti, vandalism and trash were seen everywhere. With only one or two businesses left. I know of what I speak. I have the photos to prove it.</p>

		<p>First, the blacks will walk around in small groups. Several among them will engage in their well-known self-fondling behavior.   </p>
<p>People will notice their lawn mowers and other things are missing.</p>
<p>Then the yards of the blacks will revert to type, and the flowers and shrubs will disappear because they just don&rsquo;t care for such things. That barren, desolate look, so familiar to us in the South,  will appear.</p>
<p>Next, grafitt1 will appear on various buildings and houses.</p>
<p>Whites will move out, and there will be vacant houses to be trashed and vandalized.</p>

		<p>For years we&rsquo;ve stood by and allowed the slow erosion of our race. The Globalists, although the majority of them are White, see us as the stumbling block on the road to the achievement of their goal which is total domination of the world by one government. Europe is, for all practical purposes, in its death throes. The US and Australia are the two remaining obstacles.<br>
Witness the &#8220;Town Hall&#8221; meetings that have been televised e.g. Lebanon Pa.) made up predominantly of  older White people who came prepared to debate and wouldn&rsquo;t accept Sen. Spector&rsquo;s non- answers to their questions. Young Whites have been pretty well programed in the ways of diversity and mesmerized by the charms of the prophet &#8220;Peace be upon him&#8221;.  Once White people have been successfully marginalized the agenda:<br>
1. Totally indoctrinate young Whites to accept their historic guilt for being members of the race that invented evil, then teach them the commandment &#8220;Diversity is the Lord thy God.&#8221;<br>
(Accomplished.)<br>
2. Promote miscegination ( in the media that caters to our young) especially that of Whites with Blacks. (In progress)<br>
3. Marginalize and eventually eliminate the older generation of Whites rather than wait for normal attrition.</p>
<p>3. Infiltrate predominantly White areas with underclass Blacks and Hispanics thereby creating social disorder and further convincing young Whites to avoid having children. (In Progress) <br>

		<p>  Well, it&rsquo;s finally happened: &#8220;the chickens have come home to roost&#8221; in the worlds of the late Malcolm X. Westchester County, home to so many New York ultra liberals, is about to get the bitter taste of diversity. I do feel sorry for some of the older folks who can&rsquo;t leave their homes or regular people who will see the value of their housing diminish. However, the liberal others are about &#8220;to test the depths that they profess&#8221; Dr. Faustus, Christopher Marlowe.</p>

There are quite a few republican leaning working/middle class communities particulary on the Northern edge of the county. If I was a betting man Id say most of this diverse housing will be located in the towns of Yorktown, Cortlandt, Somers and Mount Pleasant. This social engineering isnt meant for the limousine liberals of Bronxville and Scarsdale.</p>

<p>Not that they COULD, but that they were ALLOWED to.  And they were HELPED to.  None of it was accomplished on their own. Through it all, they were aided, abetted, encouraged, advised, steered,  funded and protected by well-to-do  &#8220;whites&#8221; holding influential positions in media, academe and government.

		<p>When there&rsquo;s too many blacks in a community, whites move out.</p>
<p>Wihes then build a new civilized community. When the black left behind have used and exploited all the facility that whites left, and there&rsquo;s nothing left to exploit, blacks move out and into the new area that whites have build. And the same story repeats.</p>

M.I. is all white and most of Seattle&rsquo;s Jews live on the Island if they can afford it. Obama&rsquo;s new point man for housing, Ron Sims, was our former County Executive, and he has just said that HUD will be very aggressive in pushing &#8220;fair&#8221; housing. I have a feeling the all white communities on the edges of the Puget Sound conurbation are going to feel the benefits of &#8220;diversity&#8221; very soon. </p>

		<p>Yea, DIVERSITY! Bring it ON! It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch - I, for years, lived in a neighborhood that was part of a broad social engineering experiment here in Florida, and it not-so-slowly-but-surely wrecked it, in all of the ways we commonly know and understand. Too often, the most formidable drivers of these foul ideas are the white elites who think it&rsquo;s important for people like me&hellip;nothing more than a Johnny Lunchbucket with modest resources (and, therefore, limited power)&hellip;to experience the joys of the multicultural experience&hellip;and yet, curiously, never show any interest in joining the parties they host; they, mysteriously, seem to prefer sitting off to the sidelines in their lily-white enclaves, forcing themselves to continue to deal with the problems of low crime, a better educated citizenry, annoying peace and quiet, an irritating regard for the community, and far too much social decency.<br>
 <br>
Here&rsquo;s hoping the &ldquo;Westchester Revolution&rdquo; continues; to where will the joy be next spread? How about Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard? I KNOW; build a giant community of low-cost housing next to the Kennedy compound on Hyannisport; don&rsquo;t they love this sort of thing??</p>

		<p>The reality of this case are that the numbers involved are minuscule and the lives of the rich white liberals won&rsquo;t really be affected at all, except to the degree that the county has to pay the white tax to the government and the far left political activists the government funnels billions to,  it&rsquo;s the middle class suburbs around the country that will be devastated by Ethnic Cleansing II.   It  reflects the governments (both state and federal)  new policy of pursuing whites they drove from the cities wherever they go.    The first shot in this new policy was the whining about suburban sprawl that began a while back.   It had little to do with &#8220;sprawl&#8221; at all,  it was an attempt to set up a framework, a plausible underpinning,  where white people could be forced back into the Liberal&rsquo;s beloved cities.   (It was also a backhanded acknowledgment of what Liberals really believe about &#8220;the vibrancy of diversity.&#8221;)    But the sprawl tactic wasn&rsquo;t likely to produce results since the horse was already out of the gate and the vast land areas of the U.S. made the argument weak.    Well, if the mountain won&rsquo;t come to Tyrone,  they&rsquo;ll ship Tyrone to the mountain.    Other than the freestanding genocidal hatred the left has for whites who don&rsquo;t loath whites,  it&rsquo;s all about making Liberal&rsquo;s city playgrounds less black,  and less of a black mark against the reality of  multiculturalism.

		<p>My speculation is that the liberals will never see a minority neighbor. The rich liberals with clout will make sure that these hud houses are never actually placed in THEIR areas. And the other liberals, for all their diversity promotion, already have &#8220;for sale&#8221; signs in their front yards. Liberals are always the first ones to leave.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a coincidence that the civil rights legislation didn&rsquo;t pass until we had a pretty good network of roads, along with cheap cars and cheap gasoline. We didn&rsquo;t have race-mixing before, simply because people could not afford to get away.</p>
<p>Another thought experiment: What will happen under conditions of an economic collapse, or peak oil? What if whites simply can&rsquo;t move any more, what if they have to actually live within a short distance of work? Will they put up with stereotypical behavior? Even the most liberal egalitarian can be converted into a hardcore realist, once he has the wrong kind of encounter with blacks.</p>

 It reflects the governments (both state and federal) new policy of pursuing whites they drove from the cities wherever they go. The first shot in this new policy was the whining about suburban sprawl that began a while back. It had little to do with &ldquo;sprawl&rdquo; at all, it was an attempt to set up a framework, a plausible underpinning, where white people could be forced back into the Liberal&rsquo;s beloved cities.  </p>
<p>Bud seems to have put the whole thing together very well. I just want to add my humble bit to what he said. I happened to be at a new building with a pretty liberal friend. He noted how it was a great idea that at the street level were stores, and upstairs were living units. I pointed out to him that this is how cities used to be until minorities wound up in the upstairs apartments and began their depredations on the businesses below. <br>
In general, I see this whole program of moving minorities to the suburbs as a &#8220;cancer transplant&#8221;. As I recall some years ago, there was movement called &#8220;scatter site housing&#8221; which built low income housing in otherwise solid areas.  This whole thing is a recipe for diseaster. <br>

		<p>The solution to this is quite simple.  Advertise our wishes to be able to move into these white liberal enclaves.  Identify them and what makes them so desirable to live there, make this known, even call real estate agents making inquiries into moving there.

		<p>To poster #29, my heart goes out to you brother. I think that this should be an example to all of us. It is too easy to blame the locals and root for elites to have to swallow diversity like the rest of us, but keep in mind that many inocent bystanders will be effected too. If we allow our allies to be fractured and swallowed by the rising flood then we won&rsquo;t stand a chance when the big show comes.<br>
Many posters here have suffered the effects of section 8 housing moving in and destroying their communities, and I would think it&rsquo;s all fun and games when it happens to someone else but it&rsquo;s devestating when it happens to you. Keep that in mind when you think of white flight. Sooner or later there will be nowhere safe to relocate to. I think that we must take a stand while we have a chance or else we will loose the war without so much as a fight. We are better than that. It&rsquo;s time for some solidarity instead of division among our own ranks and I am happy to see more examples of it in the mainstream media. It is time to stand up and let our voices be heard by our elected officials.</p>

		<p>The same thing is being instigated on the lower end of the economic scale in many other states and cities (Atlanta as a prime example) with the counties eliminating many of the housing projects and sprinkling all suburban neighborhoods with the formerly confined Section 8 welfare gangsta thugs; thus allowing people who moved away from the trouble to have their memories jogged about the joys of diversity.</p>

The only scintilla of happiness in this story is that bedford ny will also get a dose of diversity. Bedford is the location of one of judge leonard b. sand&rsquo;s several homes, he has another in<br>
sutton place area of manhattan.   This jerk was the judge who preside dover the yonkers-naacp desgregation case in the late 1980&rsquo;s-early 1990&rsquo;s. this was the case where he fined the city of yonkers a million dollars on day one &amp; doubled it each day until the city had to settle or go broke. The evil lawyer for naacp was michael sussman, a harvard punk paid off with an upstate farm, whom i recall exiting the wrong door at yonkers city hall, and found himself confronted by irate citizens, most of whom who had to evacuate the Bronx and make a life in Yonkers. That was a priceless moment, as was the look of panic on sussman&rsquo;s face. The moment was caught by the camera, fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on your point of view.<br>
its sad that our only joy comes at knowing the annointed class will suffer a bit of the same.  God help this country.<br>

		<p>Posters #29 (Biff Barnes) and #49 (Anonymous) seem dismayed at the characterization of Westchester County as the home to nothing but white liberal elites.  I appreciate and sympathize with their frustration, as it&rsquo;s clear that not every single person fits that description, to be sure.</p>
<p>That said, the voting patterns of Westchester County, overall, tell the tale, to a large degree.  In the 2008 presidential election, Obama beats McCain 53% to 46% nationally, while in Westchester, it was about 63% to 36%.  McCain is hardly the savior of the white race, but would any rational, race-conscious person think Obama was the better choice?  The Westchester pattern, going way back, is evident: in 2004, it was Kerry 58%-Bush 40%, in 2000 Gore 59%-Bush 36%, in 1996 Clinton 57%-Dole 36%, and on and on&hellip;</p>
<p>Biff Barnes may view he and his fellow residents as victims of interlopers like HUD and NYC&rsquo;s ADC, but the truth is that its his fellow residents who&rsquo;ve helped to install and embolden, to the tune of a mandate in Westchester, the current regime (as well as its operatives) that&rsquo;s bringing all of this about.  </p>
<p>The reality is that we ALL have some work to do in our own backyards, myself included. </p>

		<p>I live in one of the towns targeted for non-white only, affordable housing. I have never supported any liberal cause and have always been very conservative in my outlook.  So for those who see this as &#8220;karma&#8221; for the suburbs voting Democrat you off the mark. The county has a very large black and hispanic population and white elderly population which accounts for most of the disparity in the last election. Both me and my neighbor across the street were strong Republican supporters. There was never a finding of &#8220;discrimination&#8221; in this case. If this case was taken to a higher court, if judges have any sanity, it would be overturned. But the county Executive, is a typical NY Dem.Because he and his staff didn&rsquo;t fill out their HUD reports correctly,totally, I mean totally innocent people are being punished.  This ruling was pushed by the Obama white House in his general power grab. If he can target whites and Asians without any proof of wrong doing,he can hurt any group he dislikes i.e. whites in general.</p>

So Westchester county is about 10 % off the national results of the most recent Presidential elections. While the media portrays Westchester to be a white enclave it&rsquo;s non-Hispanic white population makes up only 60% of the population. It is portrayed as bastion of white liberalism. But considering the fact that whites in the Northeast are more likely to vote democrat, the fact that the Jewish population is 10% (I&rsquo;m Jewish but I don&rsquo;t have the mental illness :liberalism)the available votes for McCain if he won every other white vote is less than fifty percent. Given that McCain won 36% of the total county vote, he won between 70 and 80% of the white vote. So Westchester&rsquo;s whites voted at a higher percentage (with exception of Jews) for McCain than the percentage of the nationwide percentage of the white vote won by McCain.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading some of the squeals from Westchester residents (or sympathizers) on here who&rsquo;ve taken issue with the idea that Westchester is a bastion of liberalism, or that voting patterns don&rsquo;t tell the story.  I remain unmoved.  Let&rsquo;s put it this way, if it will make the point clearer: Lots of white people who live in nice neighborhoods and make at least upper middle-income wages have a history of voting against the interests of their own kind.  The reality is that if every white person voted in accordance with his true interests, Westchester County would be a bastion of white conservatism, and we know it&rsquo;s not even close to that.  </p>
<p>As for the &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; that some of you claim to be, welcome to the club.  When my own neighorhood began to suffer the encroachment of blacks, huge numbers of my white neighbors left, partly because they had the means to do so, but mostly because they had no will to fight.  I don&rsquo;t begrudge them the former; I do, however, begrudge them the latter - giving up ground and abandoning fellow comrades in this fight is no different than giving up ground and abandoning comrades on some far-away battlefield, and indeed, in this case, the costs are higher.  </p>
<p>Encroachment, by its very nature, has no intermediate endpoint; the only real end is when there is no earth left to encroach.  I so wish whites had learned that and lived that simple truth so long ago&hellip;but they didn&rsquo;t.  My admittedly-modest but once-nice neighborhood was easier for blacks to penetrate economically and for everyone to marginalize&hellip;so it was.  A lot of whites who live in neighborhoods that are safer, more peaceful, more affluent, and more typical examples of traditional Americana were unmoved when black hell was visited upon me and my fellow white citizens who could not leave, or who simply didn&rsquo;t understand that they should HAVE to leave homes they loved; in the minds of the more affluent &#8220;spectators&#8221; from afar, it didn&rsquo;t concern them.  Although public and economic pressure from whites as a group could have been broadly exterted throughout the local region &#8220;way back when,&#8221; and was something I and a few others tried to engender, nothing happened; many of these people wouldn&rsquo;t even vote for local candidates who clearly better-served white interests.  </p>
<p>Now, as is the nature of encroachment, the &#8220;bad element&#8221; is looking to expand, and encroach further still.  A lot of these people who thought that a combination of money and cowardice was the answer to their problems are now finding that it&rsquo;s not&hellip;and that there are no lengths to which you can travel (and still live in an economically-viable and expedient part of America) and escape the predatory nature of the black expansion.  There are serious moves afoot in my area (just outside of Central Florida) to re-zone many of the more upscale, &#8220;nice&#8221; neighborhoods so that a lot of beautiful, clean, smart white children will be forced to attend some of the area&rsquo;s worst schools.  NOW there&rsquo;s a problem, apparently.</p>
<p>Let me be clear; I don&rsquo;t really gloat over the encroachment, in all seriousness, but I do like to see it, for this reason - the only way this overall situation is going to change is if enough white people become personally revolted by having to live 24/7 among the lower-class blacks that make life so miserable for so much of the rest of society.  The sooner this invasion further into American suburbia occurs, the sooner we&rsquo;ll get to a point where real activism will take place.  Liberalism, in general, is a philosophy based in unreality; the only proponents it has are those who don&rsquo;t have to actually live WITH it and IN it.</p>
<p>As for you in Westchester who are truly victims&hellip;you&rsquo;ll have to be like me; someone who already &#8220;gets it,&#8221; but who now must wait for enough of the others to &#8220;get it,&#8221; too. Until that collective epiphany takes place, make sure you&rsquo;re fully prepared to defend your lives and your property.</p>

<p><br>
Hey, Bill: This forum works only if people respond to posts that they&rsquo;ve read in their entirety.  Nothing in your response makes any sense as a response to my historical posts on this topic.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Facts are facts.&#8221;  I agree, Bill.  So what facts are you alleging I don&rsquo;t get?  The one that I originally put out there that states that largely white populations have a long history of voting against their own interests, and that eventually those voting patterns, on behalf of all offices occupied by everyone from local selectmen up to the President, yield unfortunate consequences for all whites?  Is that one of the facts I seem to be missing?  The anti-white interests of Westchester County that you contend I serve have quantifiably and historically been far BETTER served by the resident whites of that county, as a whole, than by me or anyone else peering in at the mess.     </p>
<p>Another &#8220;fact&#8221; I put out there is that until more whites get to enjoy the 24/7 multicultural experience up close and personal, as I have had the displeasure of doing for so long now, our numbers will remain too few to change anything.  It&rsquo;s unfortunate that it takes this many supposedly-intelligent people to actually drink the cyanide before they&rsquo;re convinced it&rsquo;s poison, but what are you going to do?  This is a numbers game, and we need to take from theirs and add to ours&hellip;but sadly, we need more people to drink the cyanide first, as silly as that seems to you and I.</p>
<p>I agree that it&rsquo;s a dangerous way to go.  It&rsquo;s reminiscent of the scene from Braveheart where the Scottish rebels wait unil the British charge is practically on top of them before they raise the sharpened lances; it may provide the best chance to win, but it&rsquo;s fraught with risks.  Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re left with two choices - too many of our own kind who don&rsquo;t get it, so NOTHING changes&hellip;or waiting until the enemy is practically on top of us so that enough people come to their senses so that something actually DOES change.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s missing in these posts is recognition of the unseen (almost unmentionable)  fact that, well, not all whites are the same or share the same values or interests. We are not one monolithic group! Just being &#8220;white&#8221; does not mean that we are all united. Far from it.</p>
<p>Westchester being a suburb of NYC, is in itself a particularly good example of &#8220;Diversity&#8221; &hellip; not inter-racial diversity, granted, but of diversity WITHIN white ranks. Some sub-groups hold values or political orientation very different from others.  It is this very diversity which has prevented Westchester&rsquo;s whites from recognizing their common interests and working together to preserve them.  Since they refuse to all row the boat together, they&rsquo;ll all sink together. And it serves them right.</p>

		<p>As Bon, Tax Slave of the NWO pointed out, Palmdale California has been destroyed this way too.  I remember seeing new housing tracts going up on the edge of town when 15 year old houses closer in were being abandoned because their market value was less than the debt still owed on them.  Squatter camps in the local desert were emptied as the bums moved into the vacant houses, and section 8 homies shot at passing trains.  I couldn&rsquo;t see how any intelligent White would buy out there when the game was to obvious.  </p>
