<h1><a href="https://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2009/08/28/kennedy-and-immigration-he-changed-the-face-of-america/">Kennedy and Immigration: He Changed the Face of America</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gail Russell Chaddock, Christian Science Monitor, August 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From the 1965 overhaul that ended a system of national quotas to the failed drive launched in 2007 for comprehensive reform, Kennedy has been at the front lines making the case for a more open immigration system.</p>
<p>Taking a long view  &mdash;  compromising when needed, reaching for more the next time  &mdash;  he achieved it.</p>
<p>Senator Kennedy&rsquo;s tactics varied and coalition partners shifted during his 47 years in the Senate, but the core principle he defended never varied: The US is a nation of immigrants, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>1965: Quotas</b></p>
<p>In 1965, Kennedy led the drive for immigration reform in the Senate. Although some Irish groups lobbied against the bill, Kennedy said the current system of national quotas that favored northern Europe violated the American values.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In response to critics, he also famously claimed that the change to a system opening immigration to all nations and favoring family unification would not change the mix of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs,&#8221; he said during the Senate debate.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the mix of immigrants, legal and illegal, shifted dramatically in favor of Latin America and Asia  &mdash;  a fact that Kennedy, in later years, would attribute to illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>1980: Refugees</b></p>
<p>In 1980, Kennedy drafted the Refugee Act of 1980, which set up a system to qualify for political asylum consistent with international law. The numbers seeking refugee status  &mdash;  1.1 million in the first 10 years  &mdash;  exceeded expectations.</p>
<p><b>1986: Amnesty</b></p>
<p>In the campaign for the 1986 amnesty law, Kennedy predicted that the law would grant citizenship to no more than 1.3 million people. &#8220;We will secure the borders henceforth. We will never again bring forward another amnesty bill like this,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But by 2007, the number of people in the country illegally had jumped to more than 12 million.</p>
<p><b>His later years</b></p>
<p>Kennedy also drafted legislation in 1990 to expand opportunities for citizenship to skilled workers and, more recently, to open doors for Iraqi refugees.</p>
<p>At the end of this Senate career, he was working on a comprehensive immigration plan that would propose a path to citizenship for some 12 million people now in the US illegally, as well as stronger border enforcement and employee sanctions.</p>

		<p>What Ted Kennedy did do was allow millions of post-1965 asians,hispancs,mulsims and africans to enter America and wage a vicious demographic war against the majority Native Born White American population. If you open your eyes it is obvious that they breeding  above replacement level&hellip;way above</p>
<p>American is well down the road to racial balkanization. And after that,broken up into separate raced-based nation states. And if there is one thing that you can be certain of the ideology of liberalism which brought all of this about will be cleansed out of all these different raced-based nation states. Liberalism is a suicidal world view. Liberalism is a form of mental illness.</p>
<p>Non-whites, when they are a majority, will not be so foolish as White Americans are. When they are a majority the will implement a national origins that completetly favors their race. They will make sure that Native Born White Americans become an ever dwindling racial minority in the former America.</p>

		<p>TK either lied to us or was so deluded to think that his insane immigration policies would have no effect on our society. Or he didn&rsquo;t much care, since he was isolated in his Hyannisport enclave. At least he won&rsquo;t be able to stir up any more trouble&hellip;the worms have him now.<br>
P.S. Say hi to Mary Joe on the other side and don&rsquo;t forget to apologize to her for your cowardice&hellip; </p>

		<p>Kennedy: a fat liar, murderer, adulterer and traitor. And the media swooned over him and treated him as if he were Washington or Lincoln. This pig turned America into a third world nation while he sailed off his exclusive retreat and whored around DC and Palm Beach.</p>

		<p>Teddy was one of the people most responsible for the passing of the 1965 Immigration Law that was and is changing the face of America.  He and people like Jacob Javits and Emmanuel Cellar assisted in very quietly passing this heinous act that is leading to our destruction and the destruction of our country.  I watched all the bleeding-heart liberals at the Kennedy Library eulogize him last weekend.  It was an endless stream of out-of-touch with reality people who can afford to live anywhere they want and don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s A_ _ about anyone but themselves.  They care not for the damage that is being perpetrated on this country as long as they have money and power.  Hopefully there will be a day of reckoning for them.</p>

		<p>Is it cruel to say that I&rsquo;m happy that Ted Kennedy, the man who is responsible for turning America into a non-Western nation and the death of young woman due to his drunk driving, and is hopefully burning in hell? I can&rsquo;t believe the media is almost sanctifying this political villian with his passing.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me what was possessing Ted Kennedy to make America a non-Western nation in his support for the Immigration Act of 1965 and other amnesties for illegal immigrants? He obviously knew the consequences. His intentions were malignant. But what motivated him? What sort of benefit would he receiving from de-Europeanizing America? That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s puzzling me.</p>

		<p>What Kennedy and others like him have done to this country will take decades to undo that is if this country survives.  It will take a great deal of persistence and courage.  For this country and globally, selective breeding will have to be initiated.  There is no other choice.  The inferior genes are reproducing at a mindless pace.  Kennedy and others like him are not deep thinkers or observers.  They operate on a level of what makes them feel good about themselves.  They flood this country with inferior genes on the pretense of helping others and then make the white middle class bear the burden of supporting them.  When crimes are committed by these inferior genes, again it is the whites and other innocents that suffer the most.  Kennedy projects himself as a benevolent Santa Claus while keeping and enjoying his immense wealth.</p>
<p>Of course, the white middle class of this country is allowing all this to happen.  When someone like Watson speaks the truth, he should have been supported by the silent majority.  But off course, we are all afraid.  The screaming voices with their misconceptions of racial intelligence and orgin continue to oppress the voices of truth.  Unfortunately, the voices of reason and reality have to wait for another dawn.  On this planet, advanced civilizations have continuously appeared and disappeared.  We shall wait to see what the white race will do.  Currently, it is the white race and the yellow race that currently have a true form of civilization.  But it is in the genes of the white race that advance technical progress arises.  These genes cannot be breed with inferior genes.  The long ago Aryans of India tried to proctect their racial integrity by installing the caste system.  But it did not work.  The superior genes insisted in interbreeding eventually the Aryan civilization disappeared for the second and last time.  There were two distinct Aryan wave into India.  For the same reasons, racial deterioration occurred in Greece and Rome.  The gene pool of the original Greeks and the Aryans were the same.  Their physical appearances were tall in height and of light hair and skin similar to the peoples of Western Europe.  The origin of those genes were from the Middle East.  There is reason by the Middle East is called the craddle of civilization.  The origin of the human race is not from the black race.  The black race is just one of the colored races that appeared on this planet.      </p>
<p>Racial culture does not equal civilization.  How ridiculous to equate a static culture living in grass/tin huts/shacks on the same level as a civilization such as the present United States.  And it is pure suicide to flood this country with genes originating from those countries.  This country need to closely listen to the Founding Fathers of this country regarding race for they were deep thinkers and observers.  And they had courageous convictions.            </p>

		<p>This man was the poorest excuse for a senator than anybody I could think of.</p>
<p>He never had a job.  He never EVER had to live within a budget.  He proposed many tax hikes for the middle class, because of these lack of experiences.  He thought everybody but non-whites were like him and just wrote a check and forgot about it when bills came due.  He never lived, worked or associated with loud, abusive, unintelligent, troublemaking blacks, and lived in a  LaLa world of fantasy where he regarded those people as meek, mild-mannered and only wanting a fair shake.  The man truly was one of the greatest idiots of the Western world.</p>
<p>If we are able to secure a homogeneous portion of the US as our own, our history books will regard him as one of the biggest enemies of white people ever, right along with Obama.</p>
<p>And he will also be known as the coward who allowed a young woman to drown, because he didn&rsquo;t have the guts to dive down a few feet and simply open the car door, which even a twelve year old could do.  Mary Jo Kopechne lived for several minutes in an air bubble in the vehicle per those who investigated the crime, more than enough time to be easily saved by anyone with a little more courage than a mouse.</p>
<p>The entire publicity given to his passing was offensive to me, and I didn&rsquo;t dare turn on the T.V. for fear of putting my foot through the screen.</p>
<p>If there were real truth and justice in the world, his eulogy would have been worded exactly as the aforementioned.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The U.S. is a nation of immigrants&#8221;,,,,</p>
<p>But until 1965 that was almost entirerly European immigrants. By this time some Europeans had been in America for more then 350 years. They were into their 15th generation as North Americans. At what point in time do they cease to be &#8220;immigrants&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Ted Kennedy was a traitor to the United States - simple as that. And I say that as a Canadian. Here in Canada, he provided the impetus for former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to open up the floodgates to third world immigration in the 1970s, so that we&rsquo;re in the same situation now. So Kennedy&rsquo;s wretched 1965 Immigration Act proved directly catastrophic for America and indirectly catastrophic for Canada. In both countries, I increasingly hear fewer and fewer persons speaking English in public. And that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg re: the nightmare foisted on North Americans by that liberal, left-wing liar.</p>

		<p>I, for one, am not sorry to see Kennedy gone.  He was far to the left of John and Bobby.  There is no other politician in history who has done more to hurt whites in America and emasculate them.  He was instrumental in passing the 1965 Immigration Act, which flooded this country with third worlders from Africa, Asia and Latin America.  This has changed the demographics in the U.S., and will soon make whites a minority within 30 years.  He was a champion of quotas and preferences for minorities, which discriminated against millions of whites.  Last but not least, he pushed for legalization of millions of illegal aliens to become citizens, almost all of them Latino.  He would go to immigration rallies and speaking in Spanish, would welcome these illegals to come on in.  I hope to live long enough to see Kennedy&rsquo;s grandchildren and great grandchildren curse his name for making them a minority in their own nation and headed toward third world status.   </p>

		<p>pardon my lack of cap&rsquo;s and certain punctuation. my keyboard is damaged.<br>
i can&rsquo;t add much information to what has been said in the article except to say that kennedy to me always represented the best hypocrisy that exists.<br>
he was very willing to spend taxpayer&rsquo;s money for liberal causes.<br>
he used his reputation as a liberal to wash himself of any human flaws and sins, rendering himself practically immune to criticism. from civil rights - which really meant less rights for whites and included forced busing in boston that flooded white schools with blacks and forced innocent white children to go far beyond their neighborhood schools into spooky high-crime neighborhoods with much lower academic standards. <br>
i could go on forever about the anti-white legislation he was responsible for but when he supported the &#8221;immigration reform act of 1965&#8221; he drove a stake into the heart of white america. despite his warnings, the bill did every single thing he tried to assure an overwhelmingly white - at 90 percent - america it would not do. america has had to live with that legislation for 44 years now and it has since drastically changed the demographic from 90 plus percent white in &#8216;65 to around 66 percent now. there were a few at the time - with whitewashing by the liberal complicent media - that realized the dark nature of this deed, but few protested since the transformation had no real precident and would take place so slowly it got little notice. thank you teddy. <br>
i watched part of the funeral procession friday from the kennedy compound in hyannisport, mass. to boston. there were sizable amounts of people who were merely neighbors who came out to watch the procession - and history - roll by. i did a visual scan of the crowd to see if i could spot any dark faces he so rigorously championed all these years. it looked to me - at least from what i saw - hyannisport is a 100 percent upper class white bastion. i wonder if they have much gang violence up there. ha.<br>
the astounding hypocrisy of the kennedys never ceased to amaze me. this guy was just completely out of touch with the realities of the common man he said he represented his entire life. </p>

		<p>Future history (post Civil War II) will clearly identify Teddy Kennedy as one of the greatest TRAITORS in American history, maybe the worst TRAITOR.</p>
<p>College cheater, cowardly killer of Mary Jo, betrayer of the WASP nation, drunken sexual predator, back-stabber&hellip;on and on and on and on.</p>
<p>Over my computer desk is a picture of this fat, disgusting drunk smiling and riding the waves on one of his many yachts parked outside his West Palm Beach mansion/fortress&hellip;with quotes from Teddy about the 1965 Immigration Reform debate as follows;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the bill will not do: First our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same&hellip;Contrary to the charges in some quarters S. 500 will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and economically deprived nations in Africa and Asia&hellip;In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expecte to change as sharply as the critics seem to think&#8221;</p>
<p>Too bad Teddy wasn&rsquo;t old enough to volunteer, like WWII hero older brother Joe Jr. ? WE would all be in a better place today!</p>

		<p>Kennedy changed the face of the U.S. and not for the better. He was the worst thing that ever happened in American politics. I think he actually hated America because of what happened to his brothers. And the fact he was constantly re-elected clearly shows the voters in Massachusetts are anything but patriots. I&rsquo;m delighted he&rsquo;s gone at last, as I&rsquo;m sure millions of others are too. I just hope his influence from the grave doesn&rsquo;t bring about Obama&rsquo;s horrible health care bill. </p>

		<p>I wanted to throw up when I was listening to all the praise that Kennedy was getting from all of our &#8220;leaders&#8221;. But what really got me is when they talked about how he was leaving his beloved Hyannsport compound for the last time, having been in the family since the 1920&rsquo;s I believe. It made me think of all the Whites that were pushed out of their beloved homes\neigborhoods because of HIS pro intergration - affirmative action policies. How many of our White grandparents or parents have driven through their old neighborhoods and cried at the sight of their old house [that they built and worked their whole lives for and raised their families in] sitting there gutted and abandoned. Funny how his policies never seemed to affect HIS neck of the woods!   </p>

		<p>Anonymous asked What sort of benefit would we receive from de-Europeanizing America?  Kennedy knew that the new third-world immigrants would be largely poor and undereducated.  As such, they would be natural constituents of the Democratic Party.  If the influx were sustained, they would form a voting block large enough to eventually keep the Democratic Party in power permanently. The 13% black population plus the misguided whites who voted for Obama would not have been numerous enough to elect him. What carried him over the top was the large number of 3d world immigrants, particularly Hispanic, in the past 40 years.  Add to that a decision of the DNC in the late seventies to turn a blind eye to illegal immigration and the Left&rsquo;s persistent efforts to regularize the illegals. What the Left wants is a one-party dictatorship.   I&rsquo;m afraid if this 3rd world onslaught continues, they will get it. <br>

His own grandchildren will end their lives as racial minorites in their own country. His political legacy is horrible. His personal life was, if anything, even more appalling. A booze-hound who routinely committed adultery, left a young girl to die an agonizing drowning death. A truly despicable man and a traitor.</p>

		<p>The degenerate Kennedy clan and the Democratic party have so little support among Native Born White American  voters that they had to go out and import their voting block&hellip;and they are doing this against the will of millions of Native Born White Americans. This is obviously teason. But it is also more than treason. They Democratic party is also waging a vicious race war against the Native Born White American majority, the racial group where most opposition to post-1965 immigration policy comes from. And this opposition is growing each year.</p>
<p>Post-1965 asians,hispanics,muslims an africans have been given an opportunity by both the Democratic and Republican parties to vote for the race-replacement of the Native Born White American majority. This obvious fact should frame every public &#8220;debate&#8221; about post-1965 immigration policy.</p>

To gain support for himself Kennedy went manically left and garnered the backing of radicals, the feminists, leftists, abortionists and such ilk who desired to diversify and destroy white America.  Kennedy became their spokesman.  He was a vile, wicked, shameless and evil man without morals, values, virtues or principles.  </p>

		<p>In 1965 Senator Kennedy told the American people that the new immigration law would not upset America&rsquo;s ethnic balance.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago when I lived in Washington, I called Kennedy&rsquo;s office and asked the man who answered the phone if Kennedy had ever apologized for telling this enormous falsehood. The man said there was no reason for him to apologize because all people are the same regardless of their ethnicity, Americans had accepted the new order, and no one cared about it any longer.</p>
<p>In 1965 I was reading 6 newspapers a day.  Almost all the editorial comment agreed that the new immigration law would not change the ethnic and racial proportions in the U.S.  Only two commentators objected.  One was James J. Kilpatrick who wrote that no one could deny that if America had been founded by a different kind of people it would be a different kind of country, but he soon acquiesced.  The other was named Wilson, Earl or Richard I think, who said the new law would mean many changes: fewer movie stars like Clark Gable and more like Omar Sharif, for instance. But, he said, that is democracy and we must accept it.</p>
<p>Democracy?  If there were one real religion held by all Americans in common, it was the worship of the gods and goddesses of the silver screen.  No one really wanted it.  But anyone, everyone, could have known and certainly SHOULD have known what the new law would mean.  I knew.</p>
<p>The new law passed because Americans were fat and happy and wanted to believe what they were told and because NO ONE REALLY CARED.  </p>
<p>AND THEY STILL DON&rsquo;T!!</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Senator Jacob Javits played a prominent role in the Senate hearings on the <br>
1965 bill, and Emanuel Celler, who fought for unrestricted immigration for over <br>
40 years in the House of Representatives, introduced similar legislation in that <br>
body. &hellip; as did  organizations such as the ACLU and the Americans for Democratic Action&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Even wikipedia states:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It was proposed by Representative Emanuel Celler and Senator Philip Hart partly in response to the Civil Rights Movement and heavily supported by United States Senator Ted Kennedy&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s worked exactly as planned.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read some reports that kennedy was heavily backed, possibly even threatened with blackmail, to be the front man  &mdash;  at risk of losing his political career if he didn&rsquo;t &#8216;play along.&rsquo;  The hostile elites that wanted this bill passed would have sicced their dogs in the media on him if need be  &mdash;  and they had a lot of dirt on him  &mdash;   cheating and expulsion from Harvard, drunk driving, womanizing, the Chappaquiddick incident.</p>
<p>Kennedy continued to carry on like a drunken frat boy (remember the waitress sandwiches he and chris dodd enjoyed?) and the press gave him his pass even after his death.  Otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t have been repeatedly elected for 40 years.</p>
<p>My sorrow is only with Mary Jo&rsquo;s family, may they be at peace:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The diver, John Farrar, later testified at the inquest that Kopechne&rsquo;s body was pressed up in the car in the spot where an air bubble would have formed&hellip;.<br>

<p>Absolutely.  All the nauseating commentary in the press has been praising him for his wonderful civic conscience.  Although he was born to great wealth and privilege,  they say, and could have lived the life of a hedonistic playboy, he dedicated his life instead to doing good  for others.   </p>

<p>I am in my seventies now, and the older and wiser I get, the more I continue to realize that those who are put before us as great and wise are not necessarily so;  and those that are put up before us as saints are not necessarily holy;  and those who are reviled and scorned, even imprisoned, are often the unsung heroes ignored by the establishment and the masses   &mdash;  -  while the crooks, frauds and connivers are lionized, made famous and rich.

<p>To bad Kennedy boy didn&rsquo;t know history or he would have realized American values were built on European principles of the times. </p>
<p>Today, however, America no longer has those same values Kennedy talked about. American values no longer exist because the population of America is slowly becoming no longer (white) American. The US was founded by whites, the constitution written by whites. In fact, laws placed to protect the white population have been in place since the 1600s when Kennedy&rsquo;s own state (and colony at the time) Massachusetts restricted and banned interracial relationships.</p>
<p>If Americas founding fathers were living and breathing today they would be harassed and called racist. Funny, but American values and the whole history of America before the US forming through to the mid-1960s have been a policy of protecting whites. Our forefathers before us knew that a nations values and racial integrity only exist when it&rsquo;s protected.</p>
<p>Kennedy&rsquo;s immigration reform was against Americas values and aginst what our nations founders wanted.</p>

		<p>And these shamless opportunists and power seekers are the people we make famous and adulated and rich, and put up on a pedestal, and teach our children about, and build statues and monuments to.  Now there will be books and movies to come about the sainted Kennedy family and their terrible curse.  And  their heroic devotion to public service, despite all adversity.  Like MLK, as time goes by, their cult will grow.</p>
<p>How long will it be before a major building in Washington is built or re-named the &#8220;Ted Kennedy Congressional Library&#8221; or such-and-such&#8221;?  Or an auditorium or an airport.  Or maybe all three.  </p>
<p>And in Massachusetts, surely it will happen.  We can expect to see him deified.   </p>
<p>Ah, well.   Life is not fair.   The race is not always to the swift, nor victoy to the righteous, nor justice to the wise&hellip;..</p>

		<p>      How did he keep getting elected? Well besides the fact the Massachusetts is insanely liberal, he actually did some good in a person to person kind of way. Like the old Celtic Chieftans, his door was always open to people who needed a favor. Kind of like the godfather. Or after 9/11, he initiated contact with over a hundred families from Massachusetts who had lost someone. He kept in contact for years. Was it sincere? Don&rsquo;t know, but he made it work and this kind of thing done well does work. He was a great natural politician once he overcame his crippling inferiority complex due to living in the shadow of his brothers.<br>
He was a dedicated and giftet servant in the service of the Enemy. Thank God he&rsquo;s gone. </p>

Indeed, he did.  But not for the better!</p>
<p>I too am thankful he&rsquo;s gone. Regrettably, the harm he did will live on long after him.</p>
