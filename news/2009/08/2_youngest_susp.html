			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Ferraresi and Michael Kiefer, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), August 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The two youngest Liberian boys accused in the sexual assault of an 8-year-old girl will remain in Maricopa County juvenile detention as authorities consider allowing them to live with an uncle or order them into foster care, judges ordered today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The two youngest suspects, both refugees from war-torn Liberia, lived in the care of a grandmother and an aunt at the apartment complex where the victim was allegedly lured into a storage shed, held down, and raped.</p>
<p>According to Child Protective Services and other officials, each of the two boys have parents who remain in Africa. An uncle has offered to take the boys into his care, though state caseworkers are still investigating possible placement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cindi Nannetti, the deputy county attorney assigned to the juvenile cases, asked the judges to modify the charges against the two youngest boys so that a jury can determine whether they are guilty of sexual assault or the more serious charge of sexual conduct with a minor. Both boys also face mental competency hearings later this month. If they are found incompetent to stand trial, the charges could be dismissed.</p>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s hearings happened as a deputy ambassador from their West African homeland arrived in Phoenix to meet with Liberian community leaders, police and attorneys on the first day of a weeklong fact-finding mission into the case, which has garnered international attention.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the 9 year olds face charges of sexual assault in Juvenile Court, the two other boys accused in the July 16 attack  &mdash;  14 and 13 years old  &mdash;  face charges in Maricopa County Superior Court.</p>
<p>A grand jury indicted Steven Tuopeh, 14, on counts of kidnapping, sexual conduct with a minor and sexual assault. He will stand trial in adult court and if convicted, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the County Attorney&rsquo;s Office filed a motion in Juvenile Court to try the 13-year-old suspect in adult court as well.</p>
<p>The Liberian ambassador, Edwin Sele, answered questions briefly at Sky Harbor International Airport before heading to a meeting with members of the Liberian community. He also planned to meet Phoenix police investigators and Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas.</p>
<p>Sele said he traveled to Phoenix on behalf of Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who issued statements in the days following the boys&rsquo; arrests about her concern.</p>

		<p>Why not send them back to Liberia to live with their parents.  Of course an unremovable chip should be implanted so they can never come back to the states.</p>
<p>I assume that the ADL, SPLC, AJC, ACLU NOW crew will rush to the defense of these predators.  I&rsquo;m sure leaders of the liberian community will be arranging demonstrations on behalf of the boys.</p>

		<p> Eventually, Americans will have to decide whether we accept all cultures and all their laws, customs and beliefs totally and allow them to practice these among us with little or no regard for our laws, customs and traditions.<br>
 The concern is that our elected leaders will see this logic and continue to hold the white race to our laws and allow all others to &#8220;run amok&#8221; with theirs.<br>
 At that point we will have anarchy, every person will have to take care of themselves and the elites will simply shrug it off as another failed social experiment.</p>

<p>A female affirmative action President.  I remember when she took office, all the feminazis rejoiced.  Now she sends a high ranking diplomat to defend the rapists of an 8 year old LIBERIAN girl.  I&rsquo;d understand if the predators raped an American girl, it would just be pure racism.  But this victim was a LIBERIAN girl.</p>
<p>Typical feminazi, defends male rapists instead of their female victims. She probably keeps a copy of &#8220;Of Mice and Men&#8221; in her office.</p>
<p>Since around 1900, when the issue of black on white rape became  a liberal cause with the liberals defending the black rapists  and villifying the white women victims, the feminazis and other liberals have defended black rapists.  In 1900 the rape laws were extremely strict.  </p>
<p>But the feminazis, NAACP, ACLU, ADL, AJC and other defenders of black on white rapists managed to change the laws so that it became increasingly difficult to prosecute a black rapist of a white woman.</p>
<p>For decades, the ACLU employed white women attorneys who did nothing but defend black on white rapists.  The rapists got free legal services from the ACLU as the ACLU, NAACP, ADL,AJC made the defense of black on white rapists a major cause for most of the 20th century.</p>
<p>ACLU, ADL, AJC, NAACP were the organizations that wrote the press releases and articles that from 1910 on created the impression that all white victims of black rapists were simply liars setting up innocent, chaste and pure black men for the evil white racist police to arrest.  The terrible thing is that is worked, all too well</p>
<p>By the mid 1950&rsquo;s, the Alameda County (Oakland Ca.) district attorney&rsquo;s office refused to even try to prosecute black on white rapists because they knew the rapist would be defended by well funded ACLU, ADL, NAACP, AJC lawyers.  Also riots would ensue if the case were brought to trial.</p>
<p>The feminazis did go on a brief anti rape crusade from about 1974 to 1985, but that crusade was mainly to:</p>
<p>(1) raise money and get government funding for their anti white male crusade and pay their high salaries as &#8220;executive directors&#8221; of exterminate white male organizations.</p>
<p>(2) to villify the white male police officers and district attorneys who arrested and prosecuted the black rapists on the grounds that the police and district attorneys were &#8220;insensitive&#8221; to the white rape victims.</p>
<p>(3) To take over and replace white male police officers, investigators, district attorneys, physicians and rape counselors with communist feminazis.</p>
<p>Once their objective was achieved in a remarkably short time as police departments, DA&rsquo;s offices and hospitals caved in to the feminazi demands, the feminazis dropped their anti rape crusade, especially when they discovered the true facts of rape in this country, that blacks and now hispanics commit most of the rapes in this country.</p>
<p>Feminazis are liberals and liberals will always defend black rapists because race trumps gender and race politics rules.</p>

		<p>In the last couple of days, a ruling was overturned in Euless, Texas. An immigrant (?) is going to be allowed now to practice Santeria in his neighborhood. He can slaugher animals for some sort of sacrifice he makes. The neighbors have no say in the matter. This is another insanity being foisted on the citizens of our country. This PC mentality is destroying us.</p>

		<p>If shipping these boys and their &#8216;guardians&rsquo; back to Liberia is an impossibility, I think that the boys should be invited to live in the homes of Kennedy Family members.  Kennedy family members with young daughters would be especially appropriate.  Why should people in poor neighborhoods get to experience all the richness of diversity?  The enlightened wealthy who crafted our immigration policies also deserve some of this vibrant richness for themselves.</p>

<p>I thought these people were refugees from Liberia.  So, why are they meeting spokesmen of the government that they are supposedly fleeing from?  Sounds very cosy to me. <br>

		<p>The &#8220;children&#8221; are only 9 years of age now-imagine them when they&rsquo;re 19-fully grown and having NO fear of this society&rsquo;s laws and punishments-and they&rsquo;ll know how the &#8220;game&#8221; is played to prey on people with impunity.</p>

		<p>Ellen Sirleaf and other Liberians are outraged, not because of the rape itself; but, because the girl&rsquo;s father publicly aired the dirty laundry of Liberian attitudes on rape in Liberia. Their cover was blown, and they are angry BECAUSE OF THAT, not the fact that the girl was raped.</p>
<p>Remember Jesse Jackson referring to New York City as &#8220;hymietown&#8221; during the 1984 presidential campaign? A black reporter named Milton Coleman from one of the D.C. papers reported it. This so angered Bantus, that Farrakhan issued death threats against the reporter, for reporting it. They had no problem with Jackson&rsquo;s slur against Jews, but were foaming at the mouth because they thought &#8220;a brutha betrayed another brutha&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Bantus being Bantus. Richard Hatcher, the ex-mayor of Gary, IN would foam at the mouth and go berserk, calling people racist; for mentioning Gary&rsquo;s high crime rate. </p>
