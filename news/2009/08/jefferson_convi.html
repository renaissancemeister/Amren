<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former congressman William J. Jefferson was convicted of corruption charges Wednesday in a case made famous by the $90,000 in bribe money stuffed into his freezer and a legal battle over the raid of his Washington office that reached the highest levels of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Federal jurors found the Louisiana Democrat guilty of using his congressional office as a criminal enterprise to enrich himself, soliciting and accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to support his business ventures in Africa. The eight-woman, four-man jury convicted Jefferson of 11 of 16 counts that included solicitation of bribery, racketeering and money laundering.</p>
<p>Jurors acquitted Jefferson of three wire fraud counts, obstruction of justice and violating a law barring bribery of foreign officials. The bribery acquittal meant that jurors found that the money stashed in the freezer of his Capitol Hill home never made it to his intended target, but they convicted him of conspiring to bribe that person, a Nigerian official.</p>
<p>The verdict in U.S. District Court in Alexandria culminated an investigation that alternately fascinated and horrified much of official Washington. Jefferson is a former co-chairman of congressional caucuses on Nigeria and African trade who in 1990 became the first black congressman elected in Louisiana since Reconstruction. The low-key legislator burst into public view in 2005 when the FBI raided his home and found the cold cash wrapped in foil and stashed in Boca Burger and Pillsbury boxes.</p>
<p>Jefferson, 62, faces up to 150 years in prison when he is sentenced Oct. 30. Judge T.S. Ellis III rejected prosecutors&rsquo; efforts to send the former lawmaker to jail in advance of sentencing, allowing Jefferson to remain free on bond.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People are going to remember that this is the guy who was dumb enough to put the money in the freezer,&#8221; said W. Dennis Aiken, former chief of the FBI&rsquo;s public corruption unit, who called the case &#8220;a step forward in proving that this type of conduct is criminal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the money in the freezer, which defense lawyers acknowledged in closing arguments made Jefferson something of &#8220;a national joke,&#8221; the case was best known for the FBI raid on Jefferson&rsquo;s office in the Rayburn House Office Building. The May 2006 seizure of his computer hard drive and office files was the first time federal agents raided a congressional office, and it led House leaders to assert that the documents were privileged legislative material not subject to search.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jefferson was indicted by a federal grand jury in June 2007, the first time a U.S. official had been charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars bribery of foreign officials. He was acquitted of that charge Wednesday. Prosecutors, who presented more than 40 witnesses at the seven-week trial, told jurors the money in his freezer was meant to bribe the then-vice president of Nigeria to secure his help with a telecommunications venture. They said it was part of a pattern of illicit acts in which Jefferson used his position to direct about $400,000 in bribes, relating to business ventures he helped arrange in Africa, to companies he set up in family members&rsquo; names.</p>

<p>Harvard is getting a reputation as a school that passes dummies.  This is just one more in a long line of negative publicity for them.</p>

		<p>I have posted about &#8220;Dollar Bill&#8221; before on this forum, as I crossed paths with him before, and after, my race realism awakening. </p>
<p>This POS Dollar Bill Jefferson spoke at my high school graduation ceremony in 1982 - it was a speech that none of my classmates listened to as Dollar Bill droned on, and on, and on, for MORE THAN AN HOUR AND A HALF!!</p>
<p>All we wanted as freshly minted high school grads was to get out of that auditorium and carry on with our graduation celebrations (ours was a very illustrious public high school: even though it was technically a New Orleans public high school, it was number 3 in the nation for Fullbright and other scholarships, for example). (One of my high school buddies became a very successful neurosurgeon after doing undergraduate at Yale, and Medical school at Tulane Medical; another was the great jazzman Wynton Marsalis, who graduated a year earlier than the rest of us). </p>
<p>When I first saw this idiot, though, I was as racially clueless as 90% of white Americans were at the time. I could not make the connection between this dumb-looking, dumb-sounding idiot and the affirmative action policies that had been in place for two decades (at least) that led to his being elected, ELEVEN TIMES!, by the silly, silly &#8220;people&#8221; of pre-Katrina New Orleans. (Nola has since been cleansed: Katrina scattered the welfare rabble to ALL 48 States of the Continental US, where they are still sucking on the public teet to this day). </p>
<p>I discovered Amren only about a year after Dollar Bill made the news in 2005 with the 90k in the freezer. Only then did it all start to make sense to me. </p>
<p>This guy and his angry uppity family live only a few blocks from me, on Marengo Street in the Uptown part of Nola. He had the unbelievable cajones to run for public office again as late as December 2008, when he was defeated by a totally unknown &#8220;Republican&#8221; opponent named Joseph Cao (vietnamese businessman - don&rsquo;t forget that Louisiana currently has a governor, Bobby Jindal, whose parents were essentially ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS when their little anchor baby Bobby, future Governor of Louisiana, was born in 1974 or so). (Jindal&rsquo;s parents were scholarship hard science students from India, living fraudulently in Baton Rouge, where LSU is based). </p>
<p>Until just a few months ago, Dollar Bill had three congressional offices: one in DC, one in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, and one in New Orleans. I would call them on a regular basis, leaving official messages for ole&rsquo; Dollar Bill.  </p>
<p>I thank the Lord that Dollar Bill finally got what he had coming to him, just like OJ got his. </p>
<p>There are a few decent African Americans in legitimate positions of power in the US, but they are few and far between indeed. </p>
<p>May Dollar Bill rot in Federal Prison until his teeth fall out. It is sickening that it took so long to bring this POS simple-minded AA fraudster to justice. May this be a lesson to others like him. </p>

		<p>These people prove that with government set asides and affirmative action anyone can graduate from any institution  with their special arrangements.</p>
<p>Gender and ethnicity not abilities are the prime criteria for our new Amerika.</p>
<p>White pols have spent thousands of years learning how to steal from the people, blacks have a lot to learn about stealth and quiet aggrandizement.</p>

<p>NOLA,(poster #4), don&rsquo;t forget about the ENRON scandal after 9/11 back in 2001, the now infamous BERNARD MADOFF scandal, and those Robber-Barons on Wall Street who rips off millions and millions of hard-working Americans of their money!</p>

		<p>It is funny how the Congress which passes laws for the rest of us to follow will insist that the same laws do not apply to them. I am referring to their attempt to block the use of seized records. It as if a Congressman has some form of diplomatic immunity from prosecution. </p>
<p>Can the obvious stated? Why does it come as no surprise that a black politician would become involved in bribery?</p>
