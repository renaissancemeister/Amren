			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Mozingo and Margot Roosevelt, Los Angeles Times, August 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A dormitory burned down and 55 inmates were taken to hospitals after a riot touched off by fighting among Latino and African American prisoners shut down a 1,300-man unit of the California Institution for Men in Chino on Saturday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The disturbance was the prison&rsquo;s most violent since a December 2006 uprising in which 200 inmates rioted for 90 minutes. That racially charged incident was touched off by a fight between a Latino and an African American.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Following a 2005 Supreme Court decision that found automatic segregation to be illegal, Chino and other California prisons are moving away from the historic practice of separating inmates by race.</p>
<p>Inmates may now share cells with prisoners of different races. The barracks involved in the rioting had been fully integrated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fighting erupted in one barracks and quickly spread to six others.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you start rioting 200 in a unit, everyone knows it,&#8221; Hargrove said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Sunday, investigators still were determining what caused the melee and what sparked the fire. They planned to inventory the weapons found at the scene.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t Ruth Bader Ginsberg wonderful?  Her decision that prisoners and prisons should (in fact must) be integrated was so logical, so sensible.  Of course she was really only interested in making sure that white prisoners were available to be raped by black inmates.  This must be the icing on the cake to her.  Burning prisons.  What a wise supreme court justice she is.</p>

		<p>Here we go again. I am sure that the guys in prison did not get there for getting Boy Scout Merit Badges. But.. the purpose of prisons is not to let the inmates dole out punishment to each other. Bring back the ball and chain, and the lock step and all the stuff like chain gangs and rock piles. But.. what business is it of a bunch of politicians in black dresses (judges) to tell a prison warden how to keep his place in operation. This riot is Brown v. Board of Education at its ultimate operation. </p>

<p>Well, this is just another flaming example of what a success &ldquo;enforced&rdquo; diversity is!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the dormitory that was set on fire should have been allowed to burn into a gutted crater. Inside it, the frolicking &ldquo;Latino and African American&rdquo; convicts should have been permitted a full enjoyment of the conflagration they ignited in their shared expressions of &ldquo;brotherhood.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I am quite certain, that such a glowing endorsement of diversity&rsquo;s limits might begin to prompt even the US Supreme Court to reconsider these limits, rather than test them again in the future!<br>

		<p>Why these California prison incidents are so dangerous is this:<br>
  The prison experience is a defining feature of the lives of a very large segment of both the black and mexican populations of California -perhaps the defining feature.<br>
 The hatreds learned in prison will inevitably spill out into the outside world where young idiots wishing to show their &#8216;machismo&rsquo; will start to victimize the oppossing ethnicity in order to gain kudos with the &#8216;hard men&rsquo; in jail.<br>
  Thus we have the makings of a Balkan style race war.</p>

		<p>In their wisdom, the corrupt legal/political system has engaged in a scheme of social engineering for the purpose intended to force unlike people who have a mutual dislike of one another to live in close proximity. The result is that in none of our major cities is it safe to even be in one&rsquo;s own home, let alone to walk about on the street.</p>
<p>No satisfied with the dangerous violent mess they made of our cities, the corrupt politicians, in complicity with the corrupt legal system, are now engaged in &#8220;integrating&#8221; the California prison system. The ongoing riots at Chino should surprise no one. </p>

		<p>And the beat goes on.</p>
<p>Sheriff Baca of L.A. County, a Hispanic, is the only one not so afraid of his career who is coming right out and admitting unequivocally that there is a black/brown race war raging in California.</p>
<p>The white LA police chief, Bratton, I believe, typical of all spineless whites who are afraid the truth will harm their careers, says he doesn&rsquo;t agree.  He would change his mind tomorrow, however, and declare an ongoing racial war in his area if the politically correct mantra was to say it was so.  Aren&rsquo;t our white leaders such principled beings?</p>
<p>It looks like California will be the first state to go bankrupt, and right along with bankruptcy automatically comes anarchy.  Anarchy, of course, in a multiracial society, means armed conflict between the races.</p>
<p>And I fully expect the Bratton types to deny it is occurring as the fighting is raging around them.</p>
<p>Tom Chittum said California would be ground zero in our next upheaval in his book, Civil War II.  We don&rsquo;t have long to wait, so we&rsquo;ll see if he is right once again.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t California supposed to release thousands of inmates to save money because of its budget crisis? This kind of rioting between blacks and mexicans could spread to city streets as a result. When will our elites learn that the country&rsquo;s relationship with blacks has been very volitile during the past 40 years and imporing millions of hispanics is just making the whole situation worse.</p>

		<p> They&rsquo;re trying to determine what caused the riot? How about &#8220;that addle-pated 2005 court ruling&#8221;? As I recall, the ruling resulted from a lawsuit filed by   &mdash;   who else?   &mdash;   a black inmate alleging that segregation by race among inmates was &#8220;unconstitutional.&#8221; Scratch a black, find a troublemaker.</p>
<p> I hope those Supreme Court justices are happy now. Maybe next time some people will be killed in the riot. Maybe if they are, it will bring the justices to their senses and they will somehow revisit that ruling. But don&rsquo;t count on it. Meanwhile, maybe the minority of White inmates at the prison could set up a concession stand at the next riot. &#8220;Get your chitlins and tamales right here, while they&rsquo;re hot!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The government run news media here in California has mentioned  racial riots in the prison. What they have hardly mentioned is that they are between latinos and blacks. The multiculturalists dread the idea of riots between minorities,afterall,these &#8220;non-violent minorities&#8221;, as the left always paints them,(compared to whites with their history of violence agaisnt the rest of the world)should be in a state of blissful harmony with each other.</p>

		<p>Some posters on this thread are not aware of what the actual living conditions are like where the ruckus occurred. Like a lot of state prisons, California houses supposedly non-violent offenders in dormitory style buildings. Typically there will be about 200 inmates in each building. They use bunk beds and in some cases triple bunk beds. The buildings have several unlocked  doors that open to the outside in the event of fire. Chino is an old facility with some wooden buildings. Most of the 33 prisons in California have more modern dormitory buildings made of concrete block construction. The conflicts occur because there is close spacing of the beds and the various races are forced to live in close proximity to each other. The showers, telephones and toilets are open to the view of a single  correctional officer that sits at a podium overlooking the 200 or so inmates in his/her unit. This permits a single guard to supervise 200 inmates. These inmates leave the dorms for various jobs and meals every day. They also can walk out to outside exercise areas until around 10 PM each night. It is kind of like being in the army.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s baffling when whites take sides with either blacks or Hispanics in their contempt for one another. Should whites always have to choose between the lesser of two evils? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d be willing to bet if all prisoners were incarcerated in actual prisons, instead of Holiday Inns complete with tv, hot plates, etc. in their cells and were never let out of those cells, prison violence would drop. How a prison can be taken over by prisoners is absolutely insane and beyond  me. If they want to exercise, run in place. The biggest riot you could have would be two fighting in a cell. Then, if there is a survivor you have room for at least one more prisoner, and if we&rsquo;re lucky, two more. </p>

		<p>When I was a Parole Officer stationed in Southern California the guys always told me that Chino was pretty nice for a prison.  It is a minimum security prison for non violent inmates, mostly non violent druggies, bad check passers etc. The prisoners like Chino, as it was considered safer than any other prison in California.</p>
<p>Of course back then it was segregated.</p>

<p>Shawn, there are plenty of prisons like that for prisoners who should have that treatment, like Pelican Bay prison in California.</p>
<p>Lots of California prisoners spend their time up in the mountains at work and firefighting camps.  In summer and fall they fight forest fires.  The rest of the year they clean up the mess from the fires and do other maintainence chores.  They live in barracks and are free to move around and go to town etc.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t commit crimes because they are away from the cities and in a rural area.  If they do commit a crime on the local population the work camp is the first place law enforcement looks, so they avoid criminal activities. It is a privilege to live in the work camps and they don&rsquo;t abuse it by committing crimes.</p>
<p>The forest fires get fought, maintainance gets done and the life is not so bad for the mostly non violent and middle aged guys in the work camps. <br>

		<p> Justice Thomas understood this would not work, this was a decision by White Elites supported by the Bush Administration,<br>
against White Americans, especially White males&hellip;. no surprise.</p>
<p>In his 28-page dissenting opinion, nearly twice as long as the majority&rsquo;s 15 pages, Justice Thomas said the gang problem in California&rsquo;s prisons was worse than elsewhere in the country. The argument that interracial housing would lead to less racial hostility among inmates is &#8220;implausible,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The California policy, which is more than 25 years old, requires that new or newly transferred inmates be placed in two-person cells, with a cellmate of the same racial and ethnic background (Japanese with Japanese, for example) during an evaluation period of 60 days. Permanent places are then assigned on a nonracial basis.</p>
<p>The policy was challenged by a black inmate, Garrison S. Johnson, who has been serving a sentence for murder since 1987 and has been transferred five times, each transfer followed by a period of segregation. He filed his own lawsuit, claiming racial discrimination, in 1995 and was eventually appointed a lawyer.</p>
<p>The Bush administration entered the case, Johnson v. California, No. 03-636, to oppose the California policy and, at the same time, emphasize its view that all government classifications by race, for whatever purpose, are subject to strict scrutiny. </p>
<p>Justices David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer signed both Justice Ginsburg&rsquo;s opinion and Justice O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s majority opinion. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy signed only the O&rsquo;Connor opinion.</p>

  __  __  __  __  </p>
<p>Indeed!   Istvan has really hit the core of the problem.  People like Ruth Bader Ginsberg absolutely MUST have integration, and they WILL push it  with ruthless determination NO MATTER  how many problems it causes or what the cost is to the rest of us, because integration is essential for them to gain and maintain control over the larger society.  To them, this is an absolutely non-negotiable issue, and they are not going to be deterred by a few mere riots   &mdash;   or by anything else, for that matter. Those such as her, these products of the Enlightenment and the Frankfurt School,  are totally committed to integration; it&rsquo;s deeply ingrained in their underlying ideology, a basic tenet that is not to be questioned or sacrificed.   You might as well ask a Moslem to stop believing in Allah.  It won&rsquo;t happen!</p>

I am just wondering why whites dont stand up to bullying blacks in prisions the way hispanics do?It really disturbs me.</p>
<p>Because there are such a tiny percentage of the prisoners.  Actually, there is the Aryan Brotherhood that stands up to black and hispanic prisoners quite well.  The Aryan Brotherhood was founded in a California prison, I think San Quentin.  The man who founded it noted that Whites always got jumped and beaten by groups of blacks or hispanics.</p>
<p>So he reasoned, if several blacks or browns can gang up on one lone white, why gangs of whites gang up on blacks or browns.  Thus the Aryan Brotherhood was founded.</p>
<p>Interesting, the Brotherhood never, ever jumps just any passing black or brown.  They only go after blacks and browns who have beaten or assaulted Whites.</p>
<p>Mostly, Whites just stick to themselves and stay out of the hispanic black war that is ongoing.  The hispanics like the whites and don&rsquo;t harm them, considering whites allies in their war against the blacks.<br>

<p>Could it be because they&rsquo;re vastly outnumbered? </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one thing. Also, whites have been mentally neutered after being barraged by a lifetime of propaganda about how oppressive and cruel they&rsquo;ve been to all the suffering minorities.</p>

<p>Actually in California whites and blacks are about equal numbers.</p>

		<p>Anonymous, I know the prisons you&rsquo;re talking about. But the vast majority of prisons send prisoners to the cafeteria for meals, prisoners have a lot of time in &#8216;the yard&rsquo; for recreation. The Supermax SHU&rsquo;s are pretty much the only ones with total segregation. I&rsquo;m just saying all prisons should be total segregation with 24 hours a day in your cell, with no opportunity to gang up on staff. Jail should not allow opportunity for gangs of people to congregate, &#8216;conversate&rsquo;, or assault staff.  Prison gangs are actually ordering hits, calling for killings in other prisons. It&rsquo;s insane they have that much control. There is dirty staff that allows this, which is another huge problem.</p>

<p>Your suggested idea sounds good but it is simply impractical based on the large number of inmates in the California prison system (180,000) and the added cost. To build individual cells for every two prisoners would mean building an additional 60,000 cells with a toilet and sink and an electric cell-door. The cell door alone costs $3,250.00 per door. The stainless steel toilets cost almost one thousand dollars a unit. Each cell has to have four concrete walls, a concrete floor and a concrete ceiling. There has to be service alleys or areas between the cells for ventilation, electrical and plumbing access. The cost to build a single cell is over $25,000. It is far cheaper to build large buildings that can house two hundred inmates with one guard watching over them. A cell-block requires numerous guards to serve meals, open doors for visits and medical appointments etc. as well as a guard with a rifle to discourage fights between inmates while going to these activities. Cell-block inmates are very costly to house. </p>

		<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve spent time traveling around in Mexico and Central America, and one thing I&rsquo;ve learned is that latinos are INCREDIBLY hostile and racist towards blacks in their own countries and towards blacks in general. </p>
<p>The so-called ideals of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; are in fact rhetorical cudgels that various &#8220;oppressed&#8221; ethnic groups use to beat up on whites, and then, with whites out of the way, without missing a beat they launch into full scale struggle against each other.</p>

		<p>The American population is perhaps second only to Australia in terms of historical and anthropological illiteracy. In this case it blinds you (Americans) to the rather obvious contributing factor to the tension between blacks and &#8216;hispanics&rsquo; being the fact that in many ways it&rsquo;s just an extention of white black tension. Americans have been brainwashed into accepting the notion of an &#8216;hispanic race&rsquo;. But there is no such thing. Many so-called &#8216;hispanics&rsquo; are white Spaniards and even those with substantial Mexican Indian admixture are seen as &#8216;white&rsquo; by most blacks, even if it&rsquo;s not politically fashionable to state such facts publicly. </p>
<p>One of the things that attracts Indians, blacks, mulattoes, and mestizos to America from Latin-America is the fact that they are &#8216;promoted&rsquo; to &#8216;Latin&rsquo; on arrival. In their native countries they are never called Latin, a term which describes white Spaniards. Imagine how many black Americans might be tempted to move to Canada if they knew they would be perceived as &#8216;British&rsquo; there? Imagine how many WASPs would be tempted to go to Canada if they knew they&rsquo;d be elegible for Affirmative Action there? Imagine an immigrant from London discovering that there were separate categories for &#8216;white&rsquo; and &#8216;Anglo&rsquo;? Now, Canada doesn&rsquo;t do this of course - It would be crazy - but that&rsquo;s precisely what the U.S. does with people with Spanish last names.</p>
