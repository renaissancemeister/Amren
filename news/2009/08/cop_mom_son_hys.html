<h1>Cop: Mom, Son Hysterical, Bloody After Gang Rape</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Skoloff, Philadelphia Inquirer, August 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A mother and her young son were hysterical, battered and bloodied at a hospital just hours after she says she was gang-raped and beaten by several masked, gun-toting teenagers, a police officer testified Monday.</p>
<p>West Palm Beach Police Officer Dustin Moore was among the first to arrive at the hospital early on June 19, 2007.</p>
<p>Moore testified he found the woman &#8220;in a fetal position laying on the bed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and her son was in a fetal position laying on a chair next to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were crying hysterically, and very emotional, upset,&#8221; Moore told jurors.</p>
<p>Tommy Lee Poindexter, 20, and Nathan Walker, 18, are being tried on 14 counts each, including sexual battery, burglary, kidnapping, grand theft and promoting sexual performance of a child.</p>
<p>During opening statements, Poindexter&rsquo;s attorney admitted her client raped the woman, and DNA evidence will link him to that crime. However, she said, there is no evidence he participated in any of the other attacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Walker&rsquo;s attorney, Robert Gershman, also questioned whether his client participated in all 14 allegations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A third teen is set for trial in September, while a fourth has pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against the others. They are being tried as adults even though they were all teenagers at the time.</p>
<p>Police are still looking for other suspects who they say drifted in and out of the apartment and took part in the horrific attack.</p>
<p>Police say up to 10 teenagers raped the woman repeatedly and forced her and the boy to perform sex acts with each other, then doused them with chemicals to clean the crime scene in their public housing complex apartment just a few miles from downtown West Palm Beach.</p>
<p>Authorities say fingerprints and DNA evidence found on clothing and condoms inside the apartment identified the defendants. Each faces a maximum 11 life sentences plus 50 years if convicted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>              11 life sentences or worse will not deter black sexual predators.What whites and others need to do is have the means to physically resist black racist sexual predators, BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.If that means injuring or killing them, then so be it.We really need to stop being such trusting imbeciles. Self defense is a legal right, and we need to start practicing it.</p>

		<p>These are the types of black teens that Obama, and other black demagogues like Jeremiah Wright, claims are treated outrageously by the white system.  You know, the ones who can&rsquo;t get ahead because of white racism and oppression.</p>
<p>Is this Rwanda or the US?  Will Obama be drawing his civilian Americorps troops from pools of criminals like these?</p>
<p>He will, of course, because the pool is so large.  It would be impossible to cull out the really bad ones, because the ones remaining would constitute very low numbers.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t know whether the victims were black or White until I came across this in the original article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The authorities don&rsquo;t know why they were targeted.  They fled Port-au-Prince, Haiti, years earlier in search of a better life. With no money, they landed in the Dunbar Village housing project, where they almost instantly became targets for crime, standing out as Haitians among the mostly American-born black residents&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>They were targeted for rape and torture, the primary motive, because they were Haitians, not because they &#8216;thought there was gold jewelry&rsquo; inside. If they were White, this would be deemed a &#8216;robbery gone wrong&rsquo; as it was in the Christian-Newsom murders.</p>
<p>Well, regardless of the race of the victims, a quick, brutal public execution should be in store for those who &#8216;showed no remorse&rsquo; (from original article).  They showed no remorse because they are not capable of remorse; it is not a part of their DNA.  </p>
<p>Here is the cretins&rsquo; reaction to the damage they&rsquo;d done (according to one of those charged):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;If you would of seen what happened, it&rsquo;s like your worst nightmare,&rsquo; Lawson wrote. &#8216;Especially what happened to the boy. And it seems like they were having fun. They were laughing and videoing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reminds me of the reports of black Africans who stood around laughing as someone was brutally necklaced.  There were also reports of laughter from the mob when Amy Biehl was viciously murdered in Africa:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Biehl was struck in the head with a brick and, bleeding heavily, dragged from her vehicle. As she tried to flee, stumbling, across the road, she was surrounded by a throng of Blacks who repeatedly kicked, stoned, and stabbed her. The fatal wound, among many, came from a knife, buried to its hilt, that entered under her ribs and ended in her heart&hellip;. She died begging for her life&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>These same vicious, brutal, torturous murders are committed by blacks wherever they are  &mdash;  Africa, Europe, the US.  Who wonders why we don&rsquo;t want to be around them and don&rsquo;t want them in our neighborhoods or around our children?</p>
<p>I suppose after this the government will deem black-dominated Section 8 housing as too dangerous for Haitians and place them in Section 8 housing mandated into White communities. </p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>Thanks Tax Slave.  My guess is that they were targeted at least partially because of their accent.  Inner city blacks have very little tolerance for those who speak differently than them, especially other blacks.  Also I agree that this attack merits national media attention and the perps maximum punishment - regardless of the victim&rsquo;s race.</p>

		<p>Finding persons in the fetal position like that is a clear indication of extreme mental abuse. Persons tortured prior to being murdered have been recorded on tape passing through stages of reverting to an infantile state, finally only able to make cries and sounds like a baby. Evil monsters like the perps that did this crime DO NEED the death penalty. I know life was not taken, but the mental problems this mother and son will have will last their lifetimes.</p>
<p>This too:</p>
<p>&#8220;During opening statements, Poindexter&rsquo;s attorney admitted her client raped the woman, and DNA evidence will link him to that crime. However, she said, there is no evidence he participated in any of the other attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>HE DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE TO HAVE PARTICIPATED. All that has to be shown is that he was present at the time or helped participate in what led up to the crime. </p>

		<p>I remember hearing about this incident when it first happened. the victims WERE Black Haitians. It is terrible when ANYONE is a victim of a crime. Especially a violent one. But you must realize that for every Black that kills or rapes or robs one White, there are 10 Black victims of these same crimes (by Black perpetrators). Crimes against Black women are often underreported and get very little media attention. But the same media wants to blow up these hoaxes (hello the Duke &#8220;rape&#8221; case) and shove them down our throats&hellip;..When does the madness end? I personally know several Black women who were raped and scared to go to the police!!! What gives?</p>

		<p> The Victims were definitely Black. Haitian. Papers were calling this the &#8216;Worst Black on Black crime in years&rsquo; and wondering why Sharpton etc weren&rsquo;t marching in support of the victims.</p>
<p> Their attackers hated them for being different in any way at all. Blacks hate Whites, Hispanics and Asians, they also Hate anyone who stands out in any way. Colors, different music, accent, a stranger in their &#8216;hood. Anything is enough to bring out the  Tribal instinct.<br/>
 Look up &#8220;Lavell Felton&#8221;. Gunned down for having a different Vehicle than the local Blacks and being in &#8216;their&rsquo; area.<br/>
 Read the stories of Black Katrina evacuees from New Orleans pack-attacked in schools by other Blacks for listening to different music and having a different accent.</p>
<p> Meet the Future of America. No &#8216;Tolerance&rsquo;, just Pure Tribal Hate and Warfare.<br/>

<p>Not true, according to Nicholas Sitxx:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;For 20 years, black criminals have targeted whites more than they have blacks (45 vs. 43 percent in recent years, with ten percent of their victims Hispanic).BTW, Statistics are from the Justice Department  &hellip; the statistician who writes pseudonymously as La Griffe du Lion concluded, regarding black-on-white crime:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In the city, the races live mostly apart from one another, so that the most convenient victims of thugs are others of the same race. Only a hunter&rsquo;s mentality could account for the data&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>If blacks are crime victims of other blacks (at 10 times the rate you claim) why isn&rsquo;t the black leadership doing anything about it?  Oh,  that&rsquo;s right!  They&rsquo;re still hunting for the Great White Bigot.  That&rsquo;s much more important than helping black victims of black crimes or harshly punishing black criminals  &mdash;  and we know they ( the media and the government) would NEVER help a White victim of black crime.</p>
<p>Notice how black-on-White crime rates are never publicized, black crime is buried by the media, black criminals given breaks by the justice department.  If their victimization rate at the hands of their fellow blacks is that high, they, as blacks, need to do something about it, not us  &mdash;  let them take care of their own.</p>
<p>Whites must look out for themselves and their loved ones because no one else will.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I personally know several Black women who were raped and scared to go to the police!!! What gives?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Because they have to return to the same community as the criminals and snitches are immediately targeted for brutal torture, robbery and murder  &mdash;  the same way black criminals target Whites.</p>

<p>Sorry that I do not have exact numbers of crimes committed by Blacks against Whites and against other Blacks. I really do not care because statistics can be twisted anyway. Now since the majority of Americans are White they of course could be a larger pool of potential victims. There are also more women then men. So women could also be at larger risk for crime then men.</p>
<p> I took a women&rsquo;s studies class when I was attending university over a decade ago. Surprisingly there were no men in the course, but only two students were Black! We were asked to help coordinate a sexual-assault awareness workshop for the campus. At our first meeting we were asked if we or someone we KNEW were a victim of a rape or sexual assault. Only the two Black females raised their hands. If 30,000 Whites are being raped daily as some stats claim how come no White female out of about 25 in the room acknowledged that. If those stats were correct they would at least know a victim. Yeah being a rape victim is not something you broadcast, but it was an awareness workshop and one of the points was to work to remove stigmas from the  VICTIMS. My point is that Black women experience just as much violence and abuse as Whites if not more. And yes I do think Whites should look out for each other, but we are all in this nation together. Therefore it is in EVERYONES best interest to take a stand against crime. </p>
<p> If it is true that so many Whites are killed by Blacks daily then what does the White &#8220;community&#8221; do? Pontificate on a website, bash people of color, take self-defense classes, protest,or are you trying to work to get laws changed????  And what &#8220;Black leadership&#8221; are you talking about? The ones you see in the media (hello Al Sharpton!) or the ones actually working in legislation wherever you are? I think some Black &#8220;leaders&#8221; of today are a joke, but there are a few who have finally realized that we cannot put the blame of society&rsquo;s ills on &#8220;the great White Bigot&#8221;.</p>

<p>The White community does not know about the humongous black-on-White crime rates.  Here are a few stats from the FBI and the Justice Department that you might want to pass on (From the Color of Crime):</p>
<p>Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely <br/>
to commit a violent crime against a white than <br/>
vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit <br/>
robbery. </p>
<p>Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit <br/>
officially-designated hate crimes against whites <br/>
than vice versa. </p>
<p>Blacks rape whites more than 100 times as frequently as whites rape blacks. Counting prison rape&hellip;blacks are 200 times as likely to rape whites, as whites are to rape blacks.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/nd64sy" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/nd64sy</a></p>
<p>Have you seen that published anywhere but here?  Why do you think the media refuse to publish or air black-on-White crime rates?  Should Whites not be told to be wary around blacks?</p>
<p>Yet the Duke non-rape case was reported here in the West Coast media, approximately 3,000 away, for weeks and months on end  &mdash;  on the front pages, no less, with prominent pictures of the White men who were wrongly accused. Ruining those boys&rsquo; lives and reputations was OK with the media.  I never did see a retraction.</p>
<p>The reason why the White community doesn&rsquo;t do more about it you ask?</p>
<p>Here is what Libertarian columnist Fred Reed, a veteran police reporter says:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;to tell the truth about black crime is a firing offense&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As a teacher, if I were to mention black-on-White crime rates in my classroom using verifiable statistics from the FBI and Justice Department, I would lose my job before the day was out.  Yes, I understand something about pride and self-worth and standing up for the truth  &mdash;  but the truth is, I have a family to support and cannot put my career on the line  &mdash;  and I don&rsquo;t know anyone who could.</p>
<p>The media, academia, and the government have Whites over a barrel  &mdash;  our only sources of true information are talk radio and the Internet  &mdash;  two things the government has specifically targeted to regulate and take over.  Why do you think the government has set its sights on taking over these two things?  What are they afraid of?</p>
<p>&ldquo;…In the city, the races live mostly apart from one another, so that the most convenient victims of thugs are others of the same race. Only a hunter&rsquo;s mentality could account for the data…�?</p>
<p>Also, this is not my writing  &mdash;  it is a quote from statistician La Griffe du Lion who must use a pseudonym, lest he lose his job for reporting the truth about black-on-White crime.</p>
<p>If you believe that the FBI, the Justice Department and La Griffe Du Lion have twisted their statistics, please feel free to present your own, from your own reliable sources.</p>
<p>Reporting on one anecdotal incident in a college classroom does not mitigate the huge number of rapes blacks commit against Whites every single day.  Did your professor mention these crime rates?  Did he/she tell you to be wary of blacks because they are &#8216;39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a White than vice versa?&rsquo;  Or did he/she give you the impression that Whites are committing most of the violent crimes against blacks AND other Whites?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Pontificate on a website, bash people of color, take self-defense classes, protest,or are you trying to work to get laws changed????&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Anytime you feel we are bashing people of color, show us where we&rsquo;re wrong.  Would you dare to go onto a black site and say the same about them bashing Whites (using the vilest language imaginable)?  Whites are bashed by the media daily, is this OK with you?</p>
<p>Take self-defense classes?  The only thing that stops a rape is a gun.  The only self-defense class I would recommend is for women to learn how to handle a gun.</p>
<p>I believe in women&rsquo;s rights  &mdash;  her right to protect herself and her children with deadly force.  Harry Browne was not wrong when he said:  &#8220;Handguns are a girl&rsquo;s best friend!&#8221;</p>

I don&rsquo;t GAF, blacks! that speak like Jamaicans and the whole gang of them were probably illegal and on various assistance programs.

<p>You made some valid points, and to answer some of your questions</p>
<p>1.) I have not seen that published anywhere but here, but to be fair I did not go looking for any detailed stats. It could be published in other places as well. I did a quick google and the 1st several hits were all linked to the same website (colorofcrime.com???) I was not even disagreeing the fact that Blacks commit more crimes, but I know the majority of violent crime Blacks commit are against other Blacks. But I still think statistics can, have been, and will always be misinterpreted or compromised. For example one site reported:</p>
<p>While African Americans comprise 13.5% of the U.S. Population, 43% of all murder victims in 2007 were African American, 93.1% of whom were killed by African Americans.(this info from Black on Black crime coalition website)</p>
<p>And another site from www.ojp.usdoj reports:<br/>
Homicide Type by Race, 1976-2005</p>
<p>                                            Victims                                    Offenders	 	<br/>
                               White	 Black	 Other	 	   White	 Black	Other<br/>
All homicides	50.9%	46.9%	2.1%	 	45.8%	52.2%	2.0%</p>
<p>Just general rape stat from another site. About 81% of rape victims are white; 18% are black; 1% are of other races. (Violence Against Women, Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Dept. of Justice, 1994.) &amp; 73% of sexual assaults were perpetrated by a non-stranger (38% of perpetrators were a friend or acquaintance of the victim, 28% were an intimate and 7% were another relative.) (National Crime Victimization Survey, 2005) Sorry, I did not have time to go into more detail on the site to get more info. But if Blacks are only 13.5% of pop in U.S. and lets just say Black females are 6.4% according to the last census, that is still an overrepresentation of Black victims too. Unfortunately, since White women are the majority of women in the U.S. they are the majority of victims of rape/sexual assault but according to RAINN website 52% of rapists are White! In a nutshell Whites SHOULD be wary of Black MALES in many circumstances but White ladies need to be cautious of White guys too. This is not offensive. As a Black female, in certain situations I am wary of Black males also.</p>
<p>2.) No. My former professor did not give the impression that Whites were committing the most violent crimes against Blacks at all. But I do remember being told most rape victims are raped by someone they know. And usually Whites know more Whites vice versa. Also many Black criminals feel Whites have more money and therefore may target them for robbery more often. And again Whites are a majority in U.S. pop overall.</p>
<p>3.) NO!!! it is NOT okay to bash Whites in the media but it is (unfairly) done too many times. I wish more people would take a stand against that. And YES I have defended Whites on a Black website when Blacks were being unfair, illogical, of just plain nasty. I have also defended them with people face to face.  Sometimes I would speak up when my White boyfriends would not.  But to me if you say something rude or mean I will take offense.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
