			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Reed, Louisiana Weekly, August 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Instead of irate demands to correct disparities of America&rsquo;s discriminatory past, Blacks who have been designated by the mainstream as our &#8220;leaders&#8221; are caught up in the drama of whether such disparities even exist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks need advocates for racial justice in America. So if not Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton, who? Black Americans make up about 13 percent of the U.S. population, but on average die younger than whites, earn less money, are more likely to be imprisoned and get less education. Who has the &#8220;street-cred&#8221; to speak, and be heard, on Black issues and aspirations?</p>
<p>Who do you say is &#8220;da man&#8221;? Name five leading and living Blacks and undoubtedly, Nation of Islam head Minister Louis Farrakhan will be on the list. {snip} The Farrakhan Factor is activism among Blacks and avocation of a racial definition (or re-definition) of Black national identity, as opposed to multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Farrakhan has been a major voice on Black issues and interests for 30 years. The nationally-circulated Final Call newspaper has been a staple in African Americans&rsquo; homes since he founded it in 1979. The Final Call is in the tradition of Black Nationalist philosophies and principles of 1) Black pride, and 2) economic, political, social and/or cultural independence from white society.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sadly, most people naming five Black Leaders would include President Obama on the list. But, Obama has revealed himself to be ambivalent on the need to confront racial disparities. His practice has been to rely on Blacks in mainstream media to talk to African Americans. If Obama wants to reach Black America he should engage with Blacks who actually have the ear and interests of Black Americans. Black publishers, Farrakhan, et al., are the established messengers to Blacks in America.<br>

<p>Allright. Let&rsquo;s talk about affirmative action, then!</p>
<p>I mean, there are many, many Blacks who are actually priviledged people. And they rose to where they are now, thanks to affirmative action. And at the expense of Whites.</p>

(Start paying attention in school. Stop wandering the hallways lookin&rsquo; fo  White bootay when you should be in class. Bring a book home, open it and read it.

		<p>There is no &#8220;da man&#8221;, and Obama sure as hell isn&rsquo;t &#8220;da man&#8221;.</p>
<p>Considering their not-so-subtle endorsement of racist Muslim black &#8220;leader&#8221; Farrakhan, I can only conclude that this is nothing but another futile attempt to rile up blacks in defense of their oh-so-terrible &#8220;injustices&#8221; they face on a day to day basis. </p>
<p>However, this article speaks truth to power, but not in the way it&rsquo;s black readers will realize. This piece clearly points out the very problem with black &#8220;leadership&#8221;. There is no such thing as black leadership; all their &#8220;leaders&#8221; are either outward racists, ambulance chasers, race mongers or downright criminals. Any black that attempts to bring light to black injustices (i.e. stop blaming whitey and get off your butt), is chastised and all but exiled from the black community. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, the great majority of blacks simply lack the intelligence and insight to see the forest for the trees. Minority-pandering, especially to blacks, is at an all-time high and the blacks continue to complain about perceived racial injustice whilst having everything virtually handed to them on a silver platter.</p>
<p>Simply put, I don&rsquo;t think there will ever be a true black &#8220;leader&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter who their &#8220;leader&#8221; is. They had Martin Luther King and Malcolm X(who was smarter and more in touch with the real world than MLK).  They could have Superman for a leader and it wouldn&rsquo;t make a difference.</p>

<p>Racial disparities among the black population are the result of lack of ability, intelligence, creativity, inventiveness, a strong work ethic, determination and ambition, to just name a few shortcomings blacks are beset with.</p>
<p>I wish somebody would please tell these people those facts over and over and over again, so they would quit trying to foist the blame for their failures and inabilities to compete on whites, and hopefully understand nobody needs to hold them back they hold themselves back due to lack of intelligence and ability.</p>
<p>Notice to All Blacks:  It isn&rsquo;t just whites you are behind.  The achievement gap doesn&rsquo;t involve blacks and whites.  Blacks are in last place among all the races of the US including American Indians.</p>
<p>The next time blacks want to raise some asinine question regarding why there are so few black successes and so many white ones, I wish they would stop and realize before they whine that there are many more Hispanic than black successes; many more Indian than blacks successes, etc.  And that all holds true when comparing them with all other peoples within the US.</p>
<p>Why do blacks want to close the gap between themselves and whites when they can&rsquo;t close the gap between themselves and all the above mentioned people?<br>

		<p>Yeah Louis, Whites have ALSO been waiting AT LEAST 30 yrs. for blacks to become independent of &#8220;White society&#8221;. I&rsquo;ve got news for ya- - it&rsquo;s NEVER going to happen!! Blacks have always been a &#8220;begger&#8221; race that&rsquo;s lived off others as far back as one can research. To this day, Africa is TOTALLY dependent on non-blacks for their very exsistance. Farrakhan is just another in a LONG line of black race hustlers who know that demonizing White folks pays very good. There is never any substance in anything this idiot says. It&rsquo;s been many years now since the &#8216;million thug-er-man march&rsquo; where he encouraged those thugs - sorry - men to go back to their &#8216;communities&rsquo; and clean them up and be role models to their &#8216;yuf&rsquo;. If anything, their &#8216;communities&rsquo; got worse.</p>

		<p>While some of you have mentioned that many blacks do indeed live unhealthier/risky lifestyles leading to disease shortened lifespans etc and their proclivities toward violence, crime,death and  prison indeed are real one cannot forget they often have bred offspring by ages 15-18 thus insuring that their genes do continue.Meanwhile the &#8220;other peoples&#8221; are still in school at that age-have only started dating if then and are looking toward the (now uncertain)future.IIRC this encapsulates P.Rushton&rsquo;s &#8220;r-lifestyle&#8221; vs &#8220;p-lifestyle&#8221; and is the basis of  demographic warfare upon  this society.</p>

		<p>So the Prez is &#8220;ambivalent on the need to confront racial disparities,&#8221; huh?</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s true enough.  &#8220;Confronting&#8221; racial disparaties in America now consists of noting that blacks lag behind other races in all areas of endeavor, excepting criminal and licentious behavior, then endlessly seeking &#8220;root causes.&#8221;</p>
<p>How about confronting the issue of intellectual disparaties between black Africans and other races?  These are well known, irrefutable, and account for the general lack of black African achievement in this country, and everyplace else they&rsquo;re found in the world.</p>
<p>No problem was ever solved by willfully ignoring clear evidence, though we&rsquo;ve been living in furious denial for at least eight decades now.</p>

<p>I disagree Charles only with your view of Farrakhan. <br>
Farrakhan is a hypocrite. He, through his dead deceased acolyte Khalid Mohamnmed (May he roast in  <br>
Hell) called for the extermination of White People. He spouted his Anti-semitism with impunity but when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer he went to a White doctor ( I believe that he was a Jew) who saved his life.</p>

<p>So if the black man is superior to the white man, as the Nation of Islam followers believe, do tell me how they lag behind the white man and die an earlier death, on average, than the white man?  I mean, if they are superior to the &#8216;weak white man&rsquo; do tell me how the &#8216;white man has oppressed us for 400 years&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>As we all know, and as evidenced by the O.J. trial, blacks couldn&rsquo;t care less about guilt or innocence. They don&rsquo;t care if Obama goes back on his word (which we all know he would NEVER do). They will vow loyalty to a murderer or worthless waste of skin as long he&rsquo;s the same color as they are. Character means nothing. The first, last and only identity they have is as black. They&rsquo;re black before they&rsquo;re Americans, black before they&rsquo;re males or females, they&rsquo;re BLACK. And the blackness or another comes before anything that has to do with the character of that other.</p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t you heard?  Louis Farrakhan has repudiated anti-Semitism, his own previously and otherwise.  It happened at about the time that he was in the O.R. intake room, grabbed the clipboard on the front of his bed, and read &#8220;Berkowitz&#8221; (or something like that) as the name of his surgeon.</p>

<p>Paisan, I think you hit the nail on the head. I get the impression that this guy Reed is practically in tears of sorrow over Obama&rsquo;s elction -BECAUSE HE&#8221;S NOT &#8220;BLACK&#8221; ENOUGH. Instead, he looks upon Farrakhan, of all people, as a &#8220;great spokesman&rsquo; for blacks in the U.S.A. I&rsquo;ll give Reed credit, for openly wanting black separatism, instead of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Didn&rsquo;t South Africa practice the same thing, separatism; among its population based on race, and wind up being vilified for it? </p>
<p>I get the impression that Reed wants someone like Quannel X to be a Bantu spokesman, and someone like Geronimo Pratt, to be president.</p>
<p>A Mugabe had his chance in 1984 and 1988, and was trounced. Jesse Jackson. And yet, this guy Reed clings to Jackson and Farrakhan, like barnacles clinging to the bottom of a ship. </p>

		<p>I, for one, WISH Obama would start speaking more like Farrakhan. At least then Whites would understand how dangerous he is.</p>

		<p>I used to think thatit was so terrible that the nation of islam wanted to have it&rsquo;s own seperate state/country for blacks. now I think that they should have one. With one condition-that after they finished ruining their country, that they could not come back to the United States and screw this country up again.I wouln&rsquo;t mind if the federal government paid any blacks to leave the U.S. and give up any claims, including citizenship,so long as they never returned to this country.Unfortunately, there would probably be very few takers.Let&rsquo;s be honest: only a few diehards would leave, and they would probably come back after awhile. It&rsquo;s a real shame.this .country will always be less than what it could have been because the people who were in charge were too soft-hearted and soft-headed to &#8220;do the right thing.&#8221;</p>
