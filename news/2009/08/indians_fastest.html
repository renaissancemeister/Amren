<h1>Indians Fastest-Growing Illegal Immigrant Group in US</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Indiatimes (Bombay), August 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Indians in the US are not only the fastest growing Asian community, but also have the dubious distinction of being fastest-growing</p>
<p>According to the American Community Survey of the US Census Bureau, the Asian Indian population in the US grew from almost 1,679,000 in 2000 to 2,570,000 in 2007.</p>
<p>With a growth rate of 53 percent the highest for any Asian American community, and among the fastest growing ethnic groups in the US, Indian Americans are the third largest Asian American ethnic group, after Chinese Americans and Filipinos.</p>
<p>When it comes to illegal immigration, Hispanic illegal immigrants largely outnumber other undocumented immigrants. Mexicans make up nearly 7 million of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The next largest group of Hispanics are Salvadorans and Guatemalans. But Indians are the fastest-growing group of illegal immigrants in the US, according to US Department of Homeland Security report.</p>
<p>There are 270,000 unauthorised Indians in the US  &mdash;  a 125 percent jump since 2000, the largest percentage increase of any nation with more than 100,000 illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Many Indians get into the US with an H-1B Visa so they do not have to cross the border illegally. Indian illegal immigrants tend to have attained a higher level of education than other illegal immigrants in the US.</p>
<p>In addition, many immigrants from India can speak English fluently. Immigrants from India often work for high-tech companies and perform highly skilled jobs such as engineering and computer programming.<br>

		<p>In view of their exploding population numbers, just wait until these Asians and Hispanics succeed in angling and/or fiddling their way into the White House. </p>

		<p>You mark my words.<br>
I confidently predict that within a couple of generations Indians will rival Mexicans in the USA in terms of numbers.<br>
 You might scoff and disbelieve me, and I probably won&rsquo;t be around 40 years hence, but if any of you here care to keep these words in the back of your mind, just try to remember where you saw it first.<br>

		<p>I may be a voice of dissent here, but I personally have no problems with those immigrating from East India. I oppose the great majority of immigration from *ahem*, other places, but personal experience has taught me that the Indians are a different bunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor mills&#8221; notwithstanding, I&rsquo;ve noticed that the Indians are a studious, intelligent group of people that assimilate well with whites and work very hard to better themselves. I&rsquo;ve had several East Indian friends and race/culture has never, ever been an issue. They also tend to be conservative.</p>
<p>Again, just personal experience. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t speak for everyone and certainly don&rsquo;t claim to know every Indian immigrant. Indians are, however, NOT to be confused with Middle-Easterners. <br>

		<p>They have incredible political clout in DC especially with the Clintons. All of the New York/New Jersy members of Congress are bought up by the Indians. American citizens are losing jobs in high tech and medical fields to these aliens because of abuses in immigration status.  Indians in general don&rsquo;t assimilate and think themselves superior to whites, let alone blacks. They are very dangerous.</p>

		<p>Assuming those Indians are Hindus and Sikhs (aka NON-MUSLIMS), I think you are fine.  Indians in general are not a problem, and I do not fear them.  Indians generally assimilate, do well in school, and commit few crimes.  Indians do not bring the crime, gang violence, drugs, and social/educational dysfunctionality that Blacks, Muslims, and Hispanics bring.  </p>
<p>That having been said, however, illegal immigration is illegal immigration-and the illegals, regardless of their brains or ability, must not be allowed to break the law!  They should all be deported!  Breaking the law is breaking the law.</p>

		<p>over 6 million illegal indians have moved into the US. Many are illegal because they forged all their education and work experiences to get the visa in the first place. others are illegal because if in the rare case they do have a degree&hellip; its a 3 yr degree</p>
<p>I think 99% unemployment for american engineers is quite enough, but they refuse to cancel the H-1B program even in this hell economy</p>

<p>  &mdash;    Wake up &#8216;Anonymous&rsquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the point.  The point is their immigrating here (as well as all the other 3rd World groups) in such large numbers is changing the entire fabric of Western Civilization.  This country was founded on European principles by Europeans as Jared Taylor has stated on so many occasions.  We&rsquo;re losing our heritage, traditions, culture, heroes - our very history and essence - just to let these hard working people have a &#8220;chance&#8221;?  We have no obligation to anyone but ourselves.  The projections indicate that in about 30 years India will have 1.7 BILLION people.  They will pass China in population.  Where do you think they&rsquo;re coming? - That&rsquo;s right - here to the United States.  When you call your computer company and speak to someone in New Delhi and they&rsquo;re ultra-courteous, why do think they&rsquo;re that way?  I&rsquo;ll tell you why, to compensate for their lack of competency.</p>
<p>As Jared might say; do you let a bunch of strangers into you&rsquo;re home and partake of your food and your lodging simply because they&rsquo;re hard-working?  Sooner or later the strangers are going to claim your home as THEIRS, and then YOU will be evicted.  Who is foolish enough to believe that when we&rsquo;re a minority, these other groups are going to be so generous to us?  No.  We will be a hated AND hunted minority in the country that our ancestors founded, with nowhere to turn.</p>

		<p>I notice many posters here lauding Indian immigration.<br>
Cast your mind back 40 years or so, and many &#8216;conservative&rsquo; types used to laud Mexican immigration (before the real deluge started), saying that Mexicans were &#8216;hard-working&rsquo;, &#8216;conservative&rsquo;, &#8216;family oriented&rsquo;, have &#8216;American values&rsquo; etc.<br>
 Ignorance ( I do not use the term lightly) is perhaps the White nationalist movement&rsquo;s biggest enemy.<br>
 If those posters here would actualy care to study the case histories of nations where mass Indian immigration actually occurred, they will see another story.</p>

		<p>You guys need to check this out. indians are flooding out of the UK for the US.</p>
<p>They are not genius&rsquo;s, just averagely qualified people.</p>
<p>I suspect they are offered these visa&rsquo;s by Indians already over there. If so they are either bogus business&rsquo;s or they are discriminating in favour of indians over American citizens in employment practices. We have a similar scam whereby indians/Pakistani&rsquo;s set up &#8220;colleges&#8221; in the UK and issue student visa&rsquo;s. They then take money from students who are allowed in but never study, just disappear into the population.</p>

		<p>To see the full detrimental effects of Indian migration one must examine the Gulf countries or the UK for the expected consequences:</p>
<p>Those who pave the way are the Aryan-blooded Brahmins; whose Eurasian blood was sufficient to warrant their position as priests in the Indian caste system/power structure.</p>
<p>Following the priests, now the players in media and business in India, comes the warrior caste.</p>
<p>And once these get castes enter the wrest of the wretched pyramaid follows: the converts to Christianity and Islam who were lured to other religions by social enequity and are generally a wretched lot of womanizing alcoholics.</p>
<p>And then come the Dravidian Australoids, of the same race and behavior as that group in some ways-no tolerance to alcohol, prone to impulsive violence, peadophiliac behavior etc.  Their capacity for engineering and mathematics is doubly unfortunate in the face of the industry sector in California, because they are in some ways more savage than other minorities but can be put to some use as IT coolies.</p>
<p>Tangentially, and currently to the misfortune of Canada, is the arrival of the Sikh Jatts and Rajputs, who are descended from vicious Sythian tribes on the steppes of Siberia and South Russia who are very dim and violent&hellip;and also tremedously strong and good at fighting.  In Canada they have doubled the crime-rate.</p>

		<p>Since presumably the article is referring to Indians of the Hindu and Sikh cultures, we must bear in mind that like all non-whites, they don&rsquo;t differ in their aims to usurp the natives of host nations most especially white nations and steal their territories, disenfranchsing them of their natural rights both territorially and culturally speaking, the intent being primarily to hijack the natural living spaces along with the natural/native built resources of others for the accommodating of their own out-of-control populations and to create replicas of their own alien lands of origin in the process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the case of former British rule, Indians had their lands returned them.  Lingering whites were soon made to feel resented and unwelcome which was not entirely surprising in the circumstances.  However, idiotic white everywhere are permitting non-whites to not only retain their own lands of origin, but to steal white lands as well.  This state of affairs cannot be tolerated indefinitely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Kenya and learnt from a few native Kenyans that the Indians went about more or less snapping their fingers at the Kenyans, ordering them about all over the place in their own country, if you please!  Do you think these Indians are going to treat indigenous whites any differently if we allow them to get away with usurpation?  Of course not!</p>
<p>I have also worked alongside such Indians in the insurance industry.  I found them to be inherently arrogant and somewhat condesending in a rather patronising manner.</p>
<p>In the opposite scenario, would these non-white invaders enjoy seeng their lands being overrun by myriads of alien races?  No, of course they wouldn&rsquo;t and what&rsquo;s more, they&rsquo;d make sure the authorities knew about their disapproval and displeasure of such developments.</p>

<p>Native Born White Americans should not be sittng down with hindus to discuss how much American territory should be handed over to India. Clyde Wilson,Michael Hill and the League of the South,Kirkpatrick Sale   may be enthusiastic about doing this. But I&rsquo;m not. It is race treason.</p>
<p>How did Native Born White Americans manage to survive all these years without the hindus in America? Quite well thank you.</p>
<p>Daily Separatist</p>
<p>There are lots of Native Born White American families who have been harmed by hindu immigrants. They steal our jobs and wages. They are also actively participating in the destruction of who knows how many centuries of Native Born White American enginering experience-current and future generations. The hindus in America are predatory. They own over 150 memebers of the US congress through an organization called the India policy group.</p>
<p>You are a race traitor.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans are not interchangeable with hindus street,by street,town by town,and state by state.</p>
<p>Every hindu that enters America is one more vote for the race-replacement of Native Born White Amerians. In the next election, the Repulican party will put forth the race-replacement enthusiast and son  of hindu LEGAL IMMIGRANTS as the party&rsquo;s presidential candidate. The Republican party is the anti-Native Born White American party. This makes the Republican party the evil party.</p>

		<p>I have a big problem with Indians. I have seen them destroy the programming field. They have absolutely destroyed the wages of the programmers in this country. I know a lot of old programmers whose jobs have been taken over by Indians or shipped over to India. It is gratifying to at least see that these original white corporations that bought them over as cheap labor are now losing lots of business. Indians have made their own buisness relations with the company they were contracted to and are cutting Whitey out of the picture as their new company take over their former employers accounts. They are different and are every bit as dangerous to western survival and prosperity as blacks and latinos and muslims.</p>
<p>They are still different. Just like the Latinos came here to work cheap labor then bring their culture with them. They have no qualms of crushing you if they were to get the population percentage in their favor. </p>

<p> Yes, they are a problem if they are here illegally and taking jobs away from Americans. Limited numbers of highly educated Indians may not be too much of a problem, but as their numbers grow so too does their demand for group rights and privileges. Indians as a whole are not conservative but vote mainly for the left leaning Democratic Party.  As population growth is the chief cause of environmental degradation, why should India be allowed to illegally export her surplus population to the United States? Do we really want a population of nearly one half billion in only a few decades?  </p>

		<p>There have been many posters over the past the years who have described the harm done to themselves and their families by LEGAL IMMIGRANT hindus. Brenda Walker has a web site where the victims of hindu agression can post their horror stories.</p>
<p>Several years ago a 40 year Native Born White American Man of Irish ancestry shot himself in the head after being forced to train his hindu LEGAL IMMIGRANT replacements at a San Francisco bank.</p>
<p>I know many Native Born White American Engineers who despise the hindu LEGAL IMIGRTANT.  These White Men harbor enormus rage and anger toward the hindu LEGAL IMMIGRANT. I am comming across more and more White Guys in the engineering profession who hold tese views.</p>
<p>Six years ago on the Lou Dobbs show an arrogant mutimillionaire hindu LEGAL IMMIGRANT stated in no uncertain terms that if the H-1 B visa program was terminated the hindu community in America would retaliate. A few weeks later a young multimillionaire hindu LEGAL IMMIGRANT was on the Lou Dobbs show making the same threat if the outsourcing of jobs to india was shut down. This was right after a segment on the Lou Dobbs show which showed a video of Native Born White American Male engineers and computer programmers barging into a NYC closed door meeting of corporate officers-many of them LEGAL IMMIGRANT hindus-discussing the benefits of outsourcing.</p>
<p>Hindu-sihk immgration should be shut down to 0. The hindu-sihk fifth column in America should be deported.</p>
<p>The hindus and sihks want Native Born White Americans to accept patent lies about themselves such as:if the hindus and sihks weren&rsquo;t in our America, Native Born White America would never be able to produce its own medical doctors,nurses,engineers and computer progammers. The hindu-sihk jusitifcation for their presence in OUR AMERICA reeks of contempt for the Native Born White Ameican majority that founded and built.</p>

		<p>Indians may be &#8220;hard-working&#8221; and &#8220;studious,&#8221; but I have found them   &mdash;   and I refer to their middle- and upper-middle-classes   &mdash;   to be astoundingly arrogant and nasty.  This is especially true for the women.  </p>
<p>Experience counts.  I worked in department store sales for a number of years, and I can tell you with certainty that every single one of the hundreds of Indian females I served either haggled the price down (usually to no avail), demanded a refund, or demanded a retroactive discount.  Their persistent aggression was beyond belief.  These women may look adorable from a distance, but up close they&rsquo;re anything but.  If Indian immigration climbs far higher, we&rsquo;re all going to retail hell.  </p>
<p>Any corroborating stories?</p>

		<p>As a business owner, I deal with a number of Indians locally - many of them are doctors, plus other business owners, and to a person they are the most irritating, tight-fisted, most demanding customers we have. That same sentiment is echoed by every entity that does business with them. They don&rsquo;t listen, refuse to be told &#8216;no&rsquo;, and claim that you offered them something or a price that is totally ficticious. We all finally learned that in dealing with them you can&rsquo;t be meek; you have to be absolute, refuse to give in and stand your ground. It is a battle every time. They make it very unpleasant and take twice as long as it should in conducting business.</p>
<p>But the main point is that the U.S. is disastrously overcrowded as it is. We&rsquo;re in deep doo-doo economically; jobs &amp; mortgages are disappearing, we&rsquo;re overloading the environment, roads and cities are gridlock, and to be bringing in even one immigrant, legal or otherwise, right now is pure insanity. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the IT business as a consultant for over thirty years and I have observed the following about the Indian and Chinese imported workers:</p>
<p>They greatly desire to work among their own kind. Once they gain a foothold in a management position you can bet nearly all new hires will be of their race regardless of religion (Muslim, Christian, Hindu, or even Commie). They believe that their race is superior in intelligence and skills to &#8220;nearly&#8221; all American and European whites. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that they obtained their &#8220;fortune&#8221; in the U.S. or U.K. they believe their native culture is superior to Western culture.<br>

		<p>I think I prefer Indian immigration to Oriental. Orientals have generally been polite. I believe this is their nature, docile and not confrontational. Indians however have a different temperament that will not sit well with white Americans. And unlike Orientals, Indians do not really have  womenfolk to offer. </p>
<p>Immigration has usually affected only the lower classes, but Indians here automatically have jobs reserved for them-jobs that would have good to college-educated whites. Perhaps more of this sort of immigration will give the white thinking classes more perspective.</p>

<p>I have run into some very arrogant, rude Indians, but I have also known some who were the most humble, polite people you would ever want to meet. I think maybe it&rsquo;s a caste thing. The Hindu religion essentially teaches high-caste Brahmins that they&rsquo;re superior to everyone else, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that they would have a narcissistic complex and treat others with disdain and contempt. OTOH, if you&rsquo;re an untouchable in India, not being humble and deferential is probably a good way to get lynched, so this demeanor is probably a deeply inculcated survival strategy for low-caste Hindus. </p>

		<p>Regardless of how bright, polite, or hard-working Indian immigrants might be, they will inevitably make common cause with other minority populations against whites.  They will be another voice in the the chorus demanding (and getting) special cultural consideration, employment quotas, and suppression of nationalistic attitudes among the white population.</p>
<p>Indians are a fine people; I&rsquo;ve lived in India and have nothing against them - you just can&rsquo;t expect to import a racially, culturally, and religiously distinct group without causing serious problems.  American whites are barely hanging on as it is; we don&rsquo;t need this.</p>

		<p>So, we still have &#8220;12 million&#8221; illegals?  Some strange math, me thinks.  I often wonder how the number can be so stable over time, when one million or so cross our southern border every year.  There must be some great rate of attrition we don&rsquo;t hear about.</p>

<p>The problem is far worse than anybody realizes. Millions of Native Born White Americans are going to in for a shocker real soon. Nothing will change untill millions of White Americans expereince an extreme level of pain.</p>
<p>When they wake up, they will come to this web site where they can tap into a White Nationalist framework which WE have worked very hard to develope here.</p>
<p>The Demographc shift is happening at blinding speed.</p>

		<p>Indians are deliberately being pushed down our throats.  Hollywood is foisting an increasing stream of second-rate unsophisticated Bollywood trash movies on the American public.  These movies are pure propaganda depicting the less than one percent of light skinned Indians as representative of the majority.  Every scene is carefully sanitized to give the false impression that India is a clean, prosperous and modern country when nothing could be further from the truth.  India is as corrupt as Mexico and like Mexico it has never been our friend or ally and its people are not welcome in America&hellip;    </p>

		<p>I am employed by an Indian doctor who is a very dedicated to her practice and patients.  She is also very conservative in her political beliefs.  However, she made the comment that both of her children are liberal in their views.  Typical 2nd generation minority in the US.  Also, she made the very glaring observation the other day when discussing our flee plans from the US upon its collapse that &#8220;no country will take you in.&#8221;  Meaning me, the whitey.  After being stunned for a second, I realized she&rsquo;s probably right, just like the whites in S. Africa.  It&rsquo;s like we are planning our own genocide.  It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Insourcing&#8221; of 3rd rate H-1B visa workers is as tough on American white collar workers as the illegal (Mexican) invasion is to blue collar workers.  Of course, Globalists like Bill Gates endlessly push for more foreign workers.</p>
