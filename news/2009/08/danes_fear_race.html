			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Politiken (Denmark), July 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Almost two-thirds of Danes fear that the current conflict between the Hells Angels and immigrant gangs will develop into a regular racial conflict, according to a Megafon poll for Politiken and TV2.</p>
<p>Some 65 percent of those asked say that they fear that the gang war will develop into race riots, street warfare and general unrest.</p>
<p><b>Police downplay conflict</b></p>
<p>Police authorities, however, do not believe that race riots are a likely scenario in Denmark.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can understand that people are worried. I would urge people to look at what is actually happening, rather than listening to the rhetoric from the various parties to the conflict. There is no basis for the concern that people are showing  &mdash;  the conflict between the gangs and bikers is about crime and not race,&#8221; says Kim Klever of the National Investigation Centre (NEC).</p>
<p>The opinion poll comes a week after the Hells Angels published its &#8216;Jackal Manifesto&rsquo;  &mdash;  a controversial statement in which the group says that the ongoing gang war is not about criminal markets but rather a defence against &#8216;a mentality found predominantly among certain young people with an immigant background  &mdash;  called &#8216;jackals&rsquo; by HAMC.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>War continues</b></p>
<p>There have been two murders in the past week, which police say are gang-related. A total of six people have been killed since 2008.</p>
<p><br>
<h2>Danish Hells Angels Declare War on Muslim &#8220;Jackals&#8221;</h2></p>
<p>CounterJihad, July 2, 2009</p>
<p>The Hells Angels in Denmark, part of the world-wide motor cycle organization, declares in its recently secret manifesto war on the &#8220;Jackals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jackals&#8221; in Hells Angel&rsquo;s definition means people who &#8220;with threats and violence keep innocent Danes in a terrible iron grip.&#8221; The &#8220;Jackals&#8221; hate &#8220;Danes, Danish way of life, Christianity and their symbols.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two weeks ago the Hells Angels spokesman Jorn &#8220;Jonke&#8221; Nielsen criticized Muslims in the Danish newspaper Politiken. Nielsen said that he is very angry over Muslims &#8220;ridiculous behavior and terror against ordinary people.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arabic background</b></p>
<p>The initiative was not meant to be racist, but the &#8220;Jackals can mainly be found among people of Arabic background. Denying that would be an error.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of &#8220;Jackals&rsquo; are Muslims, claims the Hells Angels, &#8220;at least when they are at home with their father, or talking to an Iman. During their daily life they are struggling with their faith, smoking hashish, using drugs, committing crimes, drinking alcohol, and having sex outside of marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
<h2>Hells Angels&rsquo; Jackal Manifesto Is &#8220;Devilishy Well-Written&#8221;</h2></p>
<p>CounterJihad, July 5, 2009</p>
<p>&#8220;Can a convicted murderer, whom many consider as a psychopath have it right?&#8221; asks Soren Pind after another shooting drama killed a Muslim in Copenhagen yesterday.</p>
<p>Pind analyzes the Muslim-Hells Angels conflict on his blog. He regrets the development in Copenhagen and writes that the authorities have been a total failure as he throws some blame at the police leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;That we in 2009 would see gang members and murderers emerge as society&rsquo;s protectors is appalling,&#8221; writes Pind at his blog where he criticizes the Copenhagen&rsquo;s  police management in particular that believes they could have been able to talk their way  to the solution.</p>
<p><b>Guns used in Danish gang war</b></p>
<p>Søren Pind is well aware that there are several reasons for the Hell&rsquo;s Angels suddenly expressing themselfves ideologically  &mdash;  but on the other hand, it is not unprecedented, he writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of 60s, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) used to let gang members to get through the police line and attack &#8220;hippies&#8221; the gang members did not like very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>The so-called Jackal Manifesto defines &#8220;Jackals&#8221; as people, mainly Arabs, who terrorize children and youths, attack the elderly in groups and generally act aggressively in traffic.</p>
<p>&#8220;All in all, I must sadly confess that the description is not so much off the mark. What is worse,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;the manifesto is diabolically well-written. There is a profound appeal in the writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He goes on to say that there authors of the Jackal Manifesto are not incompetent, but people who know what works and how.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2009/06/jackal-manifesto.html">The Jackal Manifesto 2008</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Henrik Ræder Clausen, trans., Gates of Vienna, June 30, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>We use the word &#8220;jackal&#8221; about those we despise for good reason. A term that fits well in this context, and, seen from the true character of the animal, is well chosen. Jackals are easy to recognize from their stupid attitudes and cowardly patterns of conduct. Using this term for them is not based on prejudice or narrow-minded unwillingness to understand their &#8220;difficult circumstances&#8221;. Instead it is a term chosen after extensive consideration based on countless experiences and a life among them. From when there were just a few of them until today, when they are numerous enough to gather in groups. The Jackal Manifesto is not to be considered a derision of people with a certain tone of skin or a particular religion, nor is it a derision of the animal whose name is being used. Some self-righteous individuals will probably think of it in that way  &mdash;  peace be upon them, and then leave the victimization to them. No, the Manifesto is to be thought of as a usable tool for understanding those individuals who through threats, terror and violence hold innocent Danes, children, young and older, of all races and both genders, in an iron grip of fear. Last, but not least, this term should be used to counter the spiritual depravity of racism.</p>
<p>This manifesto is created with no use of propaganda from police, politicians or media. The manifesto is based on facts  &mdash;  actual events and a long period of experiences with the aforementioned jackals. It is about understanding and defining the kind of people we&rsquo;re dealing with. Using the term &#8220;perkere&#8221; [a Danish derogative mixing &#8220;Persians&#8221; and &#8220;Turks&#8221;] about these two-legged jackals would be misleading and excessively broad. &#8220;Perker&#8221; is a stigmatizing racist expression, quite like the use of the term &#8220;rocker&#8221; [Danish derogative for biker] has become in relation to bikers. Just as the word &#8220;rocker&#8221; has been associated with &#8220;crime&#8221;, it is now also associated with &#8220;alien&#8221; and has become a good example of how negative terms are being misused to amplify people&rsquo;s fear and hatred, for no good reason. No one with even an inkling of common sense should despise or stalk innocent, decent people just because they are different, have a different colour or culture, or simply due to it being in fashion! Doing so would eventually cause them to drag themselves down to the stage where precisely the jackals find their mental luggage, and where they belong.</p>
<p>Jackals are mainly found among people of Arab origin. Stating otherwise would be a mistake. Other nationalities are represented as well, and even dumb Danish boys. Members of the so-called immigrant gangs are not necessarily jackals. In case doubt exists as to who they are, where they come from and what they contain, we here find an excellent profile of the jackal:</p>
<p>Alone and unarmed, they are largely harmless to ordinary adults. In these situations they usually behave in a friendly manner, cringing or unpleasantly smirking. When one knows their attitudes and what they contain, and is clear about what they will say about you behind your back, they seen largely pathetic.</p>
<p>In groups of three or more they change character, become arrogant and courageous. In these groups they attack without reason or warning, targeting young and old alike.</p>
<p>They hate Danes; the mentality, the way of life, Christianity and its symbols. They frequently state &#8220;racism&#8221; as the main reason for their hatred, but they do not see the &#8220;splinter&#8221; in their own eye and believe that racism can only be white against black. They consider Denmark a country of whores, and the more harm they can inflict on the citizens of the country, the better they feel.</p>
<p>They terrorize children and the young to an extent rarely seen in this country. So grossly and massively that it gives a wholly new meaning to the term &#8220;bullying&#8221;, and it harms everyone  &mdash;  also those &#8220;New Danes&#8221; who in the eyes of the jackals are too integrated and thus traitors to their feeling of &#8220;statelessness&#8221; and &#8220;we are always right&#8221; mentality that their upbringing and twisted brains have created. Many jackals claim to be victims of a war, are children of wars, or boast of having been in war, but their &#8220;wars&#8221; are far from the Denmark that has provided every one of them a chance. That they do not go back or away to their &#8220;wars&#8221;, rather than create them here, is due to the fact that their parents fled wars, they themselves fled wars, or because they have never been close to a war!</p>
<p>They have no respect for courtesy or polite behaviour, unless it comes from their fathers, their older uncles or imams. Polite and friendly individuals are seen as easy victims, cowardly and fearsome, and they are immediately smeared when out of earshot.</p>
<p>They have no natural respect for the elderly  &mdash;  apart from the persons mentioned above. They see nothing wrong in bothering or terrorizing them, or even committing violence against them.</p>
<p>Before the legal changes about permit of residence and Danish citizenship they thought it was ridiculous to apply for Danish citizenship, in case they had not received it automatically or were born in the &#8220;country of whores&#8221;. It was enough to be here, enjoy the goods, and behave like crap.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact of almost all of them being born and raised in Denmark, they use a losers tongue with an assumed strong accent. This manner of speaking is adopted because they hate everything Danish, including the language, and because they are impressed by the language spoken by the black in the ghettos of the U.S. They want to make clear that they are outside society and are gangstas. In this manner they identify with each other and the genuine racism that the blacks have been subject to. They assume the role of the victim, which is central to their worldview.</p>
<p>They all have an oppressive mentality towards women, which they barely keep in check when looking for a date or on foreign turf. This mentality probably stems from an upbringing where they already at the age of 6-7 were given the right to decide over their mother and older sisters.</p>
<p>They harbour contempt for Danish women, their independence and their liberty, unless they do what they are told to, go along with them, or convert to Islam. If they do not, they are immediately considered to be whores, with no hint of irony! This is frequently expressed in random encounters in the street, in discotheques, in context of gang rapes, when their girlfriends intend to break up with them, or in any dealings with ex-girlfriends in general.</p>
<p>If they form the opinion that their own sisters, female cousins, mothers, or even ex-girlfriends are dressed incorrectly, too often in town, enjoy alcohol, or talk too frequently to infidels, they apply pressure on them. If the women then do not toe the line, they risk expulsion,, threats, violence or worse.</p>
<p>If anyone dares to refer to, compliment or joke about &#8220;their&#8221; women, it is never thought of as funny or friendly, but as an assault on the so-called &#8220;honour&#8221; of the jackals.</p>
<p>If they face resistance in discussion or risk a beating in some situation, they immediately fall to the ground, howling and whining like genuine jackals.</p>
<p>If they are beaten, they howl and scream, and immediately look to their own kin, pretending to have won the fight. Only when they end up in the intensive care ward, or if their visible damages are too extensive, do they admit to having been licked. In these cases they always claim that they were faced by many and had been assaulted!</p>
<p>If they are out in sufficient numbers, they have no tolerance of anyone looking at them, at the girls in their company, into their cars or simply in their general direction. In case they are alone or outnumbered, they stare into the ground or away, probably ashamed due to them knowing their true worth.</p>
<p>They systematically behave aggressively in traffic, and will, in case of random accidents, call in reinforcements from more jackals, intimidate the other parties into taking the blame, or even assault them. Even rescue staff, who should be sacrosanct in the situation, are at risk of being assaulted in their common excitement</p>
<p>They start forming groups from the age of 10-12, but most pull out of trouble and life as a jackal at the age of 25, when they get married and have children. Surprisingly, they then seem to assume that all past misdeeds are instantly forgiven.</p>
<p>They do not necessarily belong to a gang. Many of them are on their own or just a few along in daily life, but as soon as they are assembled in sufficient numbers, they feel on top of things and then the jackal mentality asserts itself in full.</p>
<p>A clear indication of a jackal feeling insecure and thus not having the courage to fight is loud shouting and wild gestures. Empty threats is a speciality, preferably from a safe distance; giving the finger from a car passing by, writing slogans on house walls or hateful messages in prison cells are examples of this. These risk-free acts are, surprisingly, considered by the jackals to be victories!</p>
<p>Fear is their weapon of choice, and precisely the fact that peaceful persons know that they may attack without reason, in groups and armed with knives, is the reason that many ordinary citizens live in daily fear of the jackals when leaving their homes.</p>
<p>In contrast to the bikers (in Danish media called &#8220;rockers&#8221;), which have also been demonized by the media, the jackals consider the &#8220;fear of them&#8221; to be something great. While bikers consider unjustified fear from strangers and ordinary citizens a burden, the jackals consider this fear to be an expression of others having respect for them. That they are something!</p>
<p>Most jackals are of immigrant background, but a few &#8220;mad dogs&#8221; of Danish ethnicity are around. They have either grown up in the wrong spot, or have been attracted by the respect (read: fear) that jackals, and to a high degree police and the press, have created around the jackal way of life.</p>
<p>The vast majority of jackals are Muslims, at least when at home at their fathers or speaking with the priest. They pretend to believe in God and that they follow the Quran. They often invoke Allah  &mdash;  in particular when in prison or when alone and scared. In daily life, however, they often fail to follow the true way of the faith: They smoke hashish, take drugs, commit crime, drink alcohol, fight, swear, commit adultery, and they most certainly cannot be blamed for NOT engaging in usury! The only rules from their faith that most follow are to abstain from eating pork and to attempt to observe Ramadan as well as they can. Apart from that, God and the guidelines of faith are merely consolation used when away from the security of the pack. This kind of faith and consolation are used by the leaders of the packs as a tool for power and to keep the crowd together when there is no other kind of sense behind their desires.</p>
<p>The jackals are occasionally presented as &#8220;foreign rockers&#8221;, and it has become routine for police and press with statements to the effect that the jackals from the gangs are worse than the &#8220;rockers&#8221;. This is an artificial comparison, but it creates some useful fear in Mr. and Mrs. Denmark. The bikers have never behaved in this manner, not even when some of them were rockers! The average Dane should obviously be scared when he or she hears about someone worse than the rockers. After twenty years of propaganda about how evil the so-called &#8220;rockers&#8221; are/were, something even worse appears!</p>
<p>Although these jackals are far from innocent, and to an unprecedented degree have been using pointless violence, it does deserve mention that precisely the police and the press have contributed to encouraging them. That has given them that inkling of courage they never would have had themselves, if it wasn&rsquo;t for that extensive coverage  &mdash;  something that in the end has rendered them more dangerous to those who do not want to, or are not able to, defend themselves.</p>
<p>Cultural enrichment is something the jackals most certainly are not part of; they are more like pure losers with an assumed role of victim. When many Danes do not feel the need or desire to extend their hand to Islam, it is hardly caused by terrorism in the world at large, or the more or less obvious crime committed by individuals. It is more likely to be the encounter with the jackals of everyday life. Never in one&rsquo;s life must one bow down to this kind of human trash!<br>

<p>The Danish definition of jackals fits Muslims all over Europe. They are aggressive, hostile to European values, and intend to put white Christians under their Islamic domination, as per the perfidious religion they profess.</p>

<p>That sounds like every non-white tribe in the US today.  They hate us, our way of life, and they keep the general white population intimidated to the point of meek submission.</p>
<p>And the authorities ALWAYS take their side on most every issue, and they&rsquo;re allowed to disparage us, curse us, call us racial slurs, beat us, rob us, and none of it will be categorized as hate crimes by the cowards in law enforcement.</p>
<p>With the tea paries the first shot of the coming revolution was fired when millions of brave citizens, amounting to 700 tea parties across the nation, voiced their dissent on tax day, April 15.  The second shot occurred July 4th, when the same events occurred. The third shot happened just recently, protesting the huge healthcare debacle, but was really about all the policies of this pro-black administration in office right now.  </p>
<p>This tells us that at least a few brave whites are ready to stand up for their country.  Unification is occurring right this minute, and like-minded people are now forming all over the country.  </p>
<p>For those who are always wondering what they can do, let me tell you that these tea party events are a start, a beginning of bigger and better protestations to come.</p>

		<p>Well, what do you know? Since many of the European governments and their polices forces and soft on Muslim thugs, things have come to a point where it takes the Hell&rsquo;s Angels to openly adress the problem!</p>
<p>Are the Hell&rsquo;s Angel&rsquo;s going to evolve into some kind of body guard agency?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; But I do know that in Sweden, not far away from Denmark, things have become so intolerably bad that Muslim rape gangs roam the streets, and native young women are scared to hell of them. Some of them, who are beautiful, natural blondes, actually dye their hair black, hoping that it makes them less likely to become targets of such gangs&hellip;</p>
<p>Hey! If the cops don&rsquo;t do their job, we are going to turn to whom we can, to get help, right? The objective is survival!</p>

		<p>The police are right about this.  The Hells Angels in Denmark are not pro-white.  They are just trying to stop immigrant gangs from taking all their business.  They may make coded appeals to race, like the Republicans do, but they are about as genuine as the GOP is too.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t romanticize the Hells Angels. They&rsquo;ve changed a lot since Hunter Thompson wrote about them back in the Sixties. The Angels are an international organized-crime group, and a particularly sleazy, violent one at that. They&rsquo;re into meth-dealing, prostitution, you name it. They&rsquo;re also very media-savvy and this &#8220;jackal&#8221; manifesto is probably just another example of Angels public relations. They&rsquo;re fighting with these Muslim gangs for drug territory, but they want it to look like they&rsquo;re Danish patriots who actually give a hoot about &#8220;Christianity and its symbols,&#8221; and the Danish way of life. What a laugh.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;At the end of 60s, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) used to let gang members to get through the police line and attack &ldquo;hippies&rdquo; the gang members did not like very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what gang Pind thinks he is talking about.  Not likely the Hells&rsquo; Angels.  The Hell&rsquo;s Angels were associated, very early on, with the Hippies at the very first of the so-called &#8220;Acid Tests,&#8221; at places in the SF Bay region such as the little town of La Honda and later at the early Long Shoreman&rsquo;s Hall parties that were called &#8220;The Trips Festivals.&#8221;  They were the ones who supplied meth (pharmeceutical meth - which was pretty much all there was then) to Beatniks like Allan Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and other Beatniks that lent the impetus of that thing that started in SF and NYC.  The Hell&rsquo;s Angels were attracted to the easy sex and open party scene, and were some of the suppliers of harder drugs like Meth, cocaine and Heroin (along with black pushers) that ruined so many of the naive, Mid-Western runaways in 1967 until the rotten SF scene (not only SF, either) became the influence by 1969 for the &#8220;Back to the Land&#8221; movement that is represented in the movie, &#8220;Easy Rider.&#8221;  The culmination of the error was symbolized in their use by the Rolling Stones at a lousy concert at the old Altamont Speedway, located between Stockton and San Jose in 1969, where the gang killed a black guy who kept charging the stage.  The Stones actually made the incident into a movie called &#8220;Gimme Shelter.&#8221;  Maybe this is the incident from which Pink draws evidence for his statement.  But there were no police there.  The overall point is that everyone old enough to remember, like me, a causual observer, could not miss the &#8220;friendly&#8221; association of the Hell&rsquo;s Angels and the Hippies, Yippies, and other social rebels of the time.  There was nothing nationalistic about the Hell&rsquo;s Angels, except for a loose association with Southern style Rebels, (they were against &#8220;the system&#8221; too) and a vauge xenophobia.  But there were plenty of Hispanics in the gang.  I&rsquo;m not saying that I know for a fact that no Hell&rsquo;s Angel ever attacked a protesting hippie in LA in the late 60s, but it would have been a personal or local attack over some problem,  (like calling San Francisco &#8220;Frisco&#8221; they felt they owned that word) not a general trend.  There were other gangs that saw themselves as in competition with the Hell&rsquo;s Angels, such as The Flying Coffins.&#8221;  They may have disliked hippies because they actually made Hell&rsquo;s Angels exclusively &#8220;cool&#8221; whereas the other bikers were seen as &#8220;wannabes.&#8221;  I mean that very early free concerts in the Pan Handle of GG Park allowed Hells Angels in as a sort of passive security force (but against authority figures).  And since they supplied non LSD drugs to the bands, they got to associate with them directly and be made a sort of elite in the eyes of all the young, naive kids watching.</p>
<p>I know all of this because I was a medical volunteer that tried to help save the kids for 15 years.  I finally gave up.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Jackal Manifesto is not to be considered a derision of people with a certain tone of skin or a particular religion, nor is it a derision of the animal whose name is being used. Some self-righteous individuals will probably think of it in that way &mdash; peace be upon them,&#8221; &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>This is not a manifesto, it is a diatribe, and a confused one.  A manifesto would list complaints systematically and then list proposed solutions.  It is full of troubling sentences like this one, which uses a Muslim blessing in order to gain some sort of righteous position.  As little as I know about Islam, I do know that if you use this phrase and certain other ones, you are considered by a Muslim to have converted.  The only principal I picked up in it is that the writer considers anyone to be a &#8220;jackal&#8221; if they behave a certain way or have a certain attitude, but if they behave, that is, do not harm anyone or seem to have this attitude, they are welcomed.  I don&rsquo;t see how this is really serving the preservation of whites or true Danes.  It might be a sort of Danish biker vigilante statement, but not much more because it is full of socialist and PC sentiment.</p>
<p>Note on the use of the word &#8220;Rocker.&#8221;  Denmark has somehow institutionalized and made colloquial, a term for British Bike riding &#8220;gangs&#8221; in England in the early 60s.  These were guys who had been influenced specifically by the movie, &#8220;The Wild One&#8221; and American, Rockabilly music.  The Beatles had actually named themselves after a fictitious gang in the movie and were initially leather clad &#8220;Rockers.&#8221;  These motorcycle enthusiasts, who often sported Confederate Flags on their jackets, were called &#8220;Rockers&#8221; by a rising group known as &#8220;The Mods&#8221; (read; modern), who liked to dress neatly, take pharmeceutical drugs, ride scooters, and provided energy to the new London music scene for groups like The Who.  After the so-called British invasion, Ringo Starr was asked by a female London journalist whether he was a Mod or a Rocker.  He replied, &#8220;I&rsquo;m a Mocker.&#8221;  The two groups clashed in what was called &#8220;riots&#8221; in places like Brighton, on the seaside, but these were really nothing compared to the things that came later and the usual Poll tax riots that had been more or less traditional in London.  The Who actually made a movie about the scene in the early 1970s.  I think it is funny how a nearby county like Denmark would latch onto the term and make it a pejorative for present day members of Hell&rsquo;s Angels.  Rockabilly music is currently very popular in Northern Europe - and has beenf or some time.  However, the European Hell&rsquo;s Angels are known for smuggling Heroin into Northern Europe, which is ruining many young people.  They are no friend of the white race.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re right, #11.  The Hell&rsquo;s Angels are really just defending their drug territory.  And Hunter S. Thompson, who apparently wrote nice things about them, was not exactly a respectable citizen, himself.  The list of drugs he abused during his lifetime was extensive.  So his flattering portrait of the biker gang may have been partially motivated by a desire to protect his drug supply line.</p>
<p>As to who will REALLY protect us whites&hellip;.well&hellip;.we&rsquo;re on our own.  Every organization will be infiltrated and rendered impotent.  So each one of us, as an individual, should research and become proficient at Krav Maga, or something similar.  I just heard of this discipline today.  I always relied upon authorities to protect me.  Now, apparently, I have to rethink&hellip;</p>

		<p>I am a regular reader of AMREN, and was suprised to come across this article, its the first one concerning the &#8221; Biker war &#8221; that doesnt try to connect the reasons for the conflict as over control of the hash routes.<br>
Im also a bit annoyed at the negative comments twords the 81, particularly the ones who decry them as no friends to the White race.<br>
Well&hellip; What have you done?<br>
They, on the other hand, have created an environment that has immigrant communities talking all over Europe, and they are afraid. Let me remind you that it is these same people you so piously look down upon, that are changing things for White people, and for the better! As to who &#8221; protects us whites, well were on uour own &#8221; what a disconnected statement, of course we are!!! Why do you think that it took a White Biker gand to be the ones to take a stand for White Danes? Because we are on our own, there is no one looking out for our interests&hellip;..this is the perfect example of Whites stepping up to the plate, from looking to our own ranks.<br>
Id like to state also that yes, the 81 does move hashish and control of other drugs in Denmark, and also are many former military servicemen, current buissness owners, clothing desighners, and own the majority of tattoo shops in Denmark. Are they poster children of law abiding citizens? No, are they Danes? Yes. And I think its sad that the &#8221; outlaw bikers &#8221; of the 81 care enough about Danish culture to risk their lives for it. No one else has stepped up to the plate.<br>
I have just moved from Denmark last April, after living there for a year. I have just recently returned from a trip there two weeks ago.Im a tattoo artist by trade, and I tattoo many 81 from Arhus and Aallborg. I have had a chance to sit down with these people and talk with them about why they fight. Early on I saw the racial aspects of this conflict that the news ignored, and was able to get first hand accounts of the honor and integrity that these men fight for. Dont sit behind your computer and spit upon men who risk their lives to fight for White culture, wether they insult your sensibilities or not. I hold them in a world of respect for their fight. <br>
A 81 tattoo artist at Route 81 tattoo was shot in the neck in Copenhagen, thier clubhouse was blown up in a hand grenade attack in Arhus, and 81 members have been shot and beaten also. They are putting their lives on the line, and its not over who moves more grams of hash.<br>
Even if that were the case, What does that say about the lack of explicitly White groups to advocate for the interests of White people&hellip;&hellip;where an organized biker club is the solution to a low intensity race war.<br>
Ill leave you with an example of an incident that took place last februrary in the city of Arhus. A young Danish girl was at the Arhus train station, waiting for her train, when an immigrant attacked her and tried to force her into a rest room to rape her. Thank God, she was able to free herself and run away. But instead of calling the police&hellip;.who are notoriously limp wristed in Denmark in dealing with this kind of offence at the hands of immigrants, and thus encourage an atmosphere of these continued attacks by  &#8221; muslim &#8221; immigrants who refer to Danish women as whores&hellip;.. she instead called her brother, who is an 81 member. He happened to be only a couple of minutes away, and arrived at the train station before the immigrant departed. He approached the immigrant, and after beating him, threw him in front of a moving train, breaking the bones in his lower body, but survivng.<br>
I guarantee you that immigrant will never again harm another white girl. The 81 are showing that there are reprocussions to harming Whites, something that no one else is doing, and making a difference, also something no one else is doing. Whites who would never venture into certain areas of Arhus and Copenhagen for fear of being immediately attacked, are now again walking those same streets in safty.<br>
It offends me to hear such exclusive comments from people on this site, especialy when it isnt only the educated Jared Taylors of our race, or the Kevin MacDonalds, or the Enoch powells, or the Geert Wilders,&hellip;.. no, the situation we are in affecets ALL OF US! </p>

<p><br>
Right, this was in Oakland, not in LA. And the Angels did attack a &#8220;peacenik&#8221; anti-Vietnam rally. But not in connivance with the police. Did it on their own accord. About ten Angels stood down about 10,000 marchers. This is not an exaggeration. The Angels knocked down the folks in the immediate front row and everyone just stood there and did not know what to do.</p>
<p>Decades ago now, the Danish police had to ask for Amnerican law enforcement help regarding the problem of the Hells Angels. The Angels, Danish born, were criminals goaded by the American gang members. The Danish police had to ask for help as they had never encountered anyone with such a degree of violence about them.</p>
<p>Even though the Angels are fearing competition from the &#8220;jackals&#8221; a lot of what they say is true. The &#8220;jackals&#8221; have no respect for Danish society or culture. And abusive to children and any other Dane they feel is weak and they can attack and get away with it. And abusive of all women as well, their own as well as Danish women. &#8220;Jackals&#8221; in a literal sense as well as a figurative. They say you can tell a lot about a criminal by observing what sorts of persons the criminal preys upon. The criminal that preys upon the y oung, the old, the weak, is A LATENT COWARD PLAIN AND SIMPLE. The &#8220;jackal&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is all a result too of NO ONE else in Denmark being willing to step up to the &#8220;jackals&#8221; and say STOP! And when I say that, I realize at the same time that just saying STOP without resulting to violence would not work. Just would not!!</p>

		<p>British Bikers are very racially aware, I have to say!  Like the majority of the indigeous white populations that comprise the British Isles, they deeply abhor and object to their ancestral homelands being perpetually invaded and swamped by hordes of non-white parasites from all over the globe.</p>
<p>I know a few Bikers who have become very dedicated members of the white survivalist movement and I&rsquo;ve even debated with and handed nationalist leaflets to those I&rsquo;ve encountered in UK seaside resorts and other tourist spots.<br>

<p>Ideally, that would be very nice. But sometimes you can&rsquo;t be picky about your friends or supporters.  In a desperate spot, you have to take what help you can get. Is anyone else helping?  If these people are willing to do what no one else is willing to do, not even the &#8220;authorities&#8221;, then I say good for them!  They may be unsavory, but they are not without redeeming qualities.  Remember that Christianity too started out with the lowest elements, considered the dregs, but eventually took over the mighty Roman Empire.</p>

		<p>Well, Audi #16, and Jeddermann # 19, I am surprised that Am Ren had the spine to Post what you wrote, and in such detail. </p>
<p>I have said the ame things numerous times, and I have yet to see their &#8220;Moderators&#8221; Post anything that I type. I&rsquo;m fed up with it. </p>
<p>I asked where the White Rage was for the Rape, Torture, and Murder of Channon Christian, and Christopher Newsom?</p>
<p>I asked where the White Rage was for Christopher Jones, a 14 year old boy, that was killed by six Black animals, one block from his home, outside Baltimore, MD? </p>
<p>I asked where the White arge was for the Witchita, Kansas murders of several Whites, both men and women, by six Blacks? </p>
<p>Visit You Tube and type in &#8220;Trisha Babcock&#8221; who was shot to death while in her car, by a Black Teenage feral beast. Again, where is teh White Rage and teh National News Coverage about all of this? </p>
<p>And yet, a Web Site that is supposed to &#8220;Represent&#8221; American Whites, and our Brothers and Sisters around the world, spends more time Blocking, and Moderating my Speech, it seems, to protect the feelings of Our Racial Enemies. That&rsquo;s why I joined Stormfront. </p>
<p>Until Am Ren stops censoring White Political speech, they will never be any better than the Liberals they oppose.</p>
<p>Grow a spine Am Ren. You really are pissing off alot of people.</p>
