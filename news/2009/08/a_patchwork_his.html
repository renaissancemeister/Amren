			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patricia A. Turner, Los Angeles Times, August 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d heard of Klan quilts, though they&rsquo;re surprisingly uncommon  &mdash;  particularly considering that the wives and daughters of &#8220;Kluxers&#8221; during the early 20th century often got together to socialize and support the cause.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I was eager to see what promised to be a fascinating  &mdash;  if disturbing  &mdash;  historical artifact, so one afternoon this spring I met the teacher, Linda Brant, at her school, and we laid out a red, white and blue quilt on a large table. The quilt&rsquo;s 18 primary blocks each carried a fiery-red cross surrounded by white and blue squares in what quilters call a nine-patch pattern. Each small blue and white square of fabric had meticulous white stitches that formed an &#8220;X,&#8221; bringing to mind the Confederate flag. The quilt could easily have been seen as simply having a Christian theme. But the story Linda told  &mdash;  along with the bright red crosses often used in Klan imagery  &mdash;  suggested otherwise.</p>
<p>Quilters have longed used their skills in the service of political, social and religious affiliations. Quilts have celebrated sororities and garden clubs; they&rsquo;ve memorialized AIDS victims and honored subjects of the Tuskegee Experiment. And there was this quilt, celebrating the chilling Klan practice of burning crosses at outdoor meetings or near the homes of those the group wanted to intimidate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brant told me that the quilt had been passed down to her from her mother, who had spent her adolescence in the home of a relative  &mdash;  a cousin of her grandmother  &mdash;  in Leavenworth, Kan. Brant told me that her mother didn&rsquo;t recall her relatives using racial slurs, but she did remember her cousin&rsquo;s husband dressing up in Klan garb and heading to meetings. The cousin hosted a group of female Klan teenagers every Wednesday night, but Brant&rsquo;s mother stayed in her bedroom during those weekly sessions.</p>
<p>The quilt, Brant&rsquo;s mother told her, was made by her relative during the late 1920s and used only on &#8220;special occasions,&#8221; when guests came to stay. When her cousin moved into a nursing home, Brant&rsquo;s mother became the custodian of her quilts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seventy years or so ago, a white woman in Kansas made a quilt celebrating the Klan. Fifty years later, its inheritor found herself unable to discuss the quilt&rsquo;s provenance with the mostly white Kansas quilt documenters. Today, that woman&rsquo;s daughter felt comfortable reaching out to an African American professor to tell the true story and to get help figuring out what to do with the quilt. {snip}<br>

		<p>Where&rsquo;s the proof that this quilt was made to promote the K cause?  The suspicious thing about the whole theory is that it took place in egalitarian holier-than-thou sanctimonious &#8220;anti-slavery&#8221; Kansas, which named everything &#8220;Free State&#8221; as a way to insult Missouri.</p>

		<p> A wonderful story, as an S.C.V. member I often am defending the Battle Flag. No defence required in this case. In the past the flag was used as a hate tool and still is today. Nothing I can do to stop people from using it any way they want.</p>
<p> However to many folks from the south, it reminds us that our ancestors fought for States rights, and slavery was a part of the &#8220;Quilt&#8221; that was made for war. no denying it. But the laws of United States of America protected slavery at the same time.<br>
To lay the blame for slavery on the doorstep of the south is wrong. It was the sin of a Nation.</p>

		<p><i>To lay the blame for slavery on the doorstep of the south is wrong. It was the sin of a Nation.</i></p>
<p>If slavery is a sin,then it&rsquo;s a sin that&rsquo;s been committed by everyone who could commit it from the day it first occurred to someone that human beings made useful accessories to a household,and didn&rsquo;t exactly <i>have</i> to get a paycheck for the services rendered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of the view that it isn&rsquo;t a sin so much as it&rsquo;s a hardwired reaction to circumstances.</p>
<p>The history of slavery might not be characterized as an honorable one,but it&rsquo;s certainly a long one. From the days of Tubal Cain until the present,everyone who&rsquo;s been able to enslave another has been busy enslaving away,to the extent that it&rsquo;s possible. </p>
<p>The only time slavery even started to die out was when large scale power production,made possible by burning coal to produce steam,appeared. And even then,the results were confined to a relatively small area and a relatively small demographic.</p>
<p>Slavery in the United States was never as widespread as popular history would have us believe,and-idiot films aside-was relatively benign. Yes,I said &#8220;relatively&#8221;,and mean it. I will not make any futile attempt to sugarcoat the lot of a slave,any time,or any place.</p>
<p>But neither will I apologize for it. Yes,slavery was legal in parts of the United States. Slavery was also legal in a great many other places,and those slave owners were no better or worse than uncounted generations before them. And I&rsquo;m not going to sit here and pretend that I believe otherwise.</p>
<p>And if someone asks for an apology,they can fire up their printer,type <b>Official Apology&#8221;</b>,print it out in big uppercase bold type,and tape the sign up on their cubicle partition. I won&rsquo;t complain a bit.</p>

		<p>Slavery was a double tragedy.  A tragedy for the blacks who were enslaved, and a tragedy for the whites who have to live with the descendants of slaves.</p>

		<p>This story cries out to be illustrated with a picture of the quilt. Yet the original author of the piece decided it was just too, too, scary and controversial to show it!</p>

		<p>slavery was wrong,and it was  practiced for many years before the United states was even an idea. It is very unfortunate that thousands of Eurpean-Americans died in the American civil war. It is also unfortunate that the rcial situation in the U.S. was never resolved. I&rsquo;m no expert on U.S. history, but from the little I know, no one seems to have really been &#8220;on board&#8221; with the idea of Blacks being full citizens of this country. It&rsquo;s too bad.I think the problems could have been avoidede if the slaves and their descendants had been repatriated to Africa. I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s possible now. The U.S. will suffer because no one had the guts to admit that very few, if any, multi-racial societies appear to be succesful.</p>
