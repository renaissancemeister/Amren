<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/us/politics/04immig.html?_r=1">Firm Stance on Illegal Immigrants Remains Policy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia Preston, New York Times, August 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A recent blitz of measures has antagonized immigrant groups and many of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s Hispanic supporters, who have opened a national campaign against them, including small street protests in New York and Los Angeles last week.</p>
<p>The administration recently undertook audits of employee paperwork at hundreds of businesses, expanded a program to verify worker immigration status that has been widely criticized as flawed, bolstered a program of cooperation between federal and local law enforcement agencies, and rejected proposals for legally binding rules governing conditions in immigration detention centers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Napolitano and other administration officials argue that no-nonsense immigration enforcement is necessary to persuade American voters to accept legislation that would give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants, a measure they say Mr. Obama still hopes to advance late this year or early next.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But advocates for immigrants said the new agreement did not include strong protections against ethnic profiling. They were surprised, they say, that Ms. Napolitano did not terminate the cooperation agreement with the sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., Joe Arpaio, {snip}</p>

<p>No one is fooled by that noise. I remember the last time the govt granted a blanket amnesty. It was Reagan in the early 80&rsquo;s and its one of the reasons we have this mess today. I liked Reagan but he really blew that one. If Reagan couldn&rsquo;t make good on amnesty do you really trust anyone else to? Don&rsquo;t be fooled - there is no such thing as a good amnesty.</p>
<p><i>But advocates for immigrants said the new agreement did not include strong protections against ethnic profiling.</i></p>
<p>And again, the politic hacks trot out &#8220;profiling&#8221; as a red herring to get around the law.</p>

		<p>I agree; BO&rsquo;s policies are indeed too tough. Hummer limos should be lined up at the border to transport illegals to the city of their choice, complete with full bar, fake SS cards, and a WalMart gift card. This Obama character is just plain mean.</p>

		<p>First comes another &#8220;amnesty,&#8221; then comes another onslaught of illegal aliens. We have been repeatedly told that each amnesty being the final one. I believe it was Teddy Kennedy who last propagated this lie. As long as illegal immigration is profitable in one way or the other, it will continue until we are the next third world country. Many of our cities have become just that.</p>

		<p>The most serious national security threat we face today is our porous border and our elected officials&rsquo; unwillingness to take any action to mitigate that danger. Attempting to legitimize the prior criminal act of illegally entering the United States by way of a temporary guest worker or amnesty program will not solve the problem. We need to be willing to do whatever it takes to end this decade long swell of illegal immigration â€“ yes, even if that means paying higher prices for good and services. <br>
Tightening border security and making every effort in eliminating all illegal immigration and drastically curtailing legal immigration will have two immediate effects; it will raise the de facto minimum wage by shrinking the labor pool thus allowing persons with few skills the opportunity to take entry level jobs with the expectation of advancement as their ability is demonstrated and, those who seek to do us harm will find it more difficult to gain entry. The grief we will face next as a nation may very well drive across an unprotected stretch of border on a flatbed truck.<br>
