<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} A new study shows that even students, with facts staring them in the face, tend to substitute Hollywood fiction for historical fact in their minds.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we found is that there&rsquo;s something really special about watching a film that lets people retain information from that film, even when they had read a contradictory account in the textbook,&#8221; said Andrew Butler, a psychology researcher at Washington University in St. Louis during the time he and his colleagues conducted the study.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a positive flip-side to this memory for movies: Researchers also found that historically accurate films can actually boost student learning alongside the usual textbook reading. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Warning: This film is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</b></p>
<p>Films that gloss over some truths could still prove useful viewing, as long as teachers warn students beforehand about the specific historical inaccuracies. General warnings about films being inaccurate proved about as useful as no warning at all.</p>
<p>Two experiments involving 108 students had different groups watch film clips from nine different movies. Students also read an accurate historical text blurb relating to each of the movies, and received different levels of warnings regarding the accuracy of the films.</p>
<p>The power of Hollywood clearly emerged when the film&rsquo;s historical information matched the information in the text. Students who watched such film clips had about 50 percent greater correct recall of facts a week later, as opposed to students who just read a text.</p>
<p>But when the film&rsquo;s information contradicted the text, students often wrongly recalled the misinformation up to half the time. Many students expressed their wrong information confidently, and sometimes even misattributed the source of their information as coming from the text, rather than from the film.</p>
<p>Only having the specific warning ahead of time reduced the misinformation effect, which previous studies have also found. {snip}</p>

		<p>I live 220 miles NE of St. Louis.  Perhaps I can get down there soon and make a few bucks writing down what ANYONE would know about books versus movies.</p>
<p>One doesn&rsquo;t have to be brilliant to learn from a film.  It smacks you in the eyes, ears, and emotions.  And, it&rsquo;s over in 90 minutes to two hours.</p>
<p>To learn from a book, on the other hand, one must have intelligence, perseverance, knowledge base, and imagination.  Books - unlike  movies - are written at grade levels so a teacher will know what his chances are of having students comprehend it.  Good luck even when you believe you&rsquo;ve made a &#8216;match&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take Edison or Einstein to interpret a movie, however, which explains why so many morons award/win so many Oscars.</p>
<p>As well, try finding a film today that shows history AS IT WAS.  I could name on two hands the movies I showed in class that didn&rsquo;t have some far-Left or fawning-African viewpoint.</p>

		<p>Somehow I bet they are not concerned about modern day inaccuracies in movies such as all of the technically proficient black heroes saving all of the white people in movies.</p>
<p>Has anybody seen the ad where the middle aged white couple is coming to after having been in an accident? Their OnStar (or whatever the service is) activates to ask if they&rsquo;ve been in an accident and to tell them help is on the way. The man grabs the woman&rsquo;s hand to ask if she is OK. At the very end of the commercial across the rear view mirror comes a lone black police officer to the rescue. Out on a rural, wooded highway no less.</p>
<p>Now if my memory serves me correctly, in almost all of the real life rescues I have seen in the media the rescuers are almost all one color, and it&rsquo;s not black.</p>

		<p>All Hollywood made Movies since the 1920&rsquo;s are just propaganda.<br>
And are made to change the culture, customs, and values of<br>
a nation.  The sad issue, is that a few wealthy movie writers,<br>
and directors have been working on an agenda that spans the<br>
years to change a nation to their pagan, and hedonistic<br>
values. And it has worked, because to many people copy what<br>
the see in the movies, and believe the propaganda, without<br>
doing any research. Movies have contributed to the dumbing <br>
down of America. The best way is to avoid all movies, and to remove the television from our daily lives. Read books, and surf the Internet for truth.</p>

		<p>I think we understand now just how the media conditions White people.  It&rsquo;s not just movies either.  It&rsquo;s news reports, sit coms, TV shows, documentaries with false information, newspapers, advertisements in newspapers and magazines, advertisements in the street and photos that work on our unconscious minds.  It&rsquo;s amazing White people haven&rsquo;t all given themselves up for reverse slavery yet.</p>
<p>If you go to most websites the photos subliminally degrade White people.  For example I went to website with job postings and the photo depicted 3 White people - one White woman and two young White guys sitting on a bench outside of an office apparently in search of a job.  The White woman was depicted as serious being shown on her Blackberry and the two White guys were depicted as clowns; one White guy was asleep and the other White guy had his legs crossed in a lotus position meditating.  Here&rsquo;s the kicker:<br>
Behind all of them in the office was a young Black male in a suit standing up making hand gestures in front of a group of seated older White men - apparently taking charge and showing them the &#8220;ways of the world&#8221;.  </p>
<p>These types of depictions are the worst because nothing is said.  The website really can&rsquo;t be accused of anything because the depictions are so subtle to most people.  Most people see these sorts of scenes and the awareness of what&rsquo;s going on never enters their conscious minds.  This is just one example of how were being insidiously conditioned to hate ourselves and have low self-esteem as Whites.  There are thousands upon thousands more.  People should actually start making records of all of this subtle conditioning so that they know what to look for and can teach other Whites.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal here? Of course movies ARE reality! Let me give you a flesh and blood illustration, from my own personal experience.</p>
<p>I saw the movie &#8216;Zulu&#8221; in 1964, when I was 8 years old. In it, it depicted the battle at Roarke&rsquo;s Drift, South Africa, where 5,000 Zulu warriors attacked a British garrison.  The Zulus attacked in wave after wave, and even managed to set fire to some of the buildings, but were ultimately repulsed.</p>
<p>The next year, 1965, we had the Watts riots, where Bantus looted and burned neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Then, we had riots in Detroit, Chicago, Newark NJ, and other places in 1967. The year 1968 saw the grand mal of all race riots, in the aftermath of the King assassination.</p>
<p>Bantus attack in great numbers against their victims. They also set fire to copious amounts of structures, like in riots or Detroit&rsquo;s Devil Night. These same American Bantus tend to act the way the Zulus in the movie did. So there is some truth in movies. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that Hollywood has ever produced a historically accurate movie, which explains why Americans believe so many lies.  One small example:  No doubt a majority of black Americans today believe that black troops liberated the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Dachau, thanks to the NPR &#8220;documentary&#8221;,  <i>Liberators: Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II</i>, which promoted that lie.  In reality, although there were black troops in the vicinity, the camps were liberated by white troops.<br>

		<p>Absolutely! I have written about this before, on this website.</p>
<p>Whoever controls the images in men&rsquo;s minds, controls the men!</p>
<p>Because we act on the images in our minds. These images are just a mental shorthand for a whole range of opinions, beliefs, and aspirations. </p>
<p>Some time ago, the images in White men&rsquo;s minds were either heroic Anglo-Saxon, Biblical, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Now, &#8220;they&#8221; are controlling our images, via movies and TV. They have COMPLETELY  done away with the Anglo-Saxon chivalry and manliness, and have twisted the biblical images to their own purposes.<br>
 <br>
The visual is what we act on.</p>
<p>Even their songs conjure up the wrong images, and are designed to do so. </p>

Every frame of every movie is meticulously planned to send a message. Everything you see in a film is there because it was chosen to be to have an affect on the audience. </p>
<p>While I know many people deride TV, film is multi-million dollar manipulation of the highest degree.</p>
<p>I watch every few films but when I do, I&rsquo;m keenly aware I&rsquo;m being manipulated.</p>

		<p>IF You Saw It in a Movie, It Must Be True. Right?</p>
<p>The visual media is extremely powerful. It has more power to brainwash people, many times over, than radio, or print. This field was investigated by the Canadian educator, Professor of English literature and philosopher, Marshall McLuhan. He coined the term &#8220;the medium is the message&#8221;. What he meant was that the media that information is presented in,(writing, television, film, radio,etc) radically influenced the message, and should be studied along with the message.</p>
<p>He considered movies as having a very big impact on the message because of the way they focused a single sense,vision, and allowed the viewer to fill in the rest of the content. This is why advertisers know, that showing the same images over and over again, is the key to influencing(brainwashing)people. You sell coke,not by explaining how good in tastes, but by showing repeat commercials of a beautiful women in a bikini, drinking coke on the beach. Your mind will fill in the rest, McLuhan might say.</p>
<p>The conclusion people can draw is that they had better be careful what they allow into their childrens, as well as their own brains. Hollywood, ALMOST ALWAYS HAS AN AGENDA IN ITS MOVIES.</p>

		<p>The media and entertainment industry has an enormous percentage of the world&rsquo;s population snowed under, particularly in the west, which makes sense given deception is their business.</p>
<p>People think the oil industry, or the armaments industry, or the mining industry are the world&rsquo;s most powerful and malign.  No, the media and entertainment sector is easily the most powerful, and easily the most malignant.</p>
<p>Classic sign of media drone: &#8220;(optional derisive/dismissive remark here) <i>it&rsquo;s just a movie</i>.&#8221;  No one who understands the power of the media says that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really creepy is the dearth of stories like this one that put hard data about the extent of media power into people&rsquo;s hands.  I&rsquo;ve been reading news from racially sane circles for going on ten years now and I can count on one hand the number of articles I&rsquo;ve read that have been truly useful and reference hard data, in fact other than this one I can think of only one (about a study showing how peer pressure affects people&rsquo;s perceptions of reality, a tangentially related subject at best).  The creepiest part is that anyone with two brain cells to rub together knows that the media has, tucked away somewhere, an entire subsection of the mental health profession, working on perfecting the understanding and manipulation of psychology vis-a-vis media technology (and practically nothing leaks out of this industry, the only point arguing against this inference that I can think of).</p>
<p>No one talks about this, not even us!  &#8220;(optional derisive/dismissive remark here), <i>it&rsquo;s just a movie</i>&#8221; is something you&rsquo;ll even hear from our side, often enough, and if anyone should know better, it&rsquo;s us.  &#8220;<i>It&rsquo;s Just a Movie</i>&#8221; is way beyond something people just say, it&rsquo;s practically a way of life vis-a-vis the media&rsquo;s interaction with society.</p>

		<p>The irony of MSNBC saying this is that movies/propaganda is how much of the liberal agenda is enacted, and how the skids are greased for its implementation.  And this is why the left reacts more viscerally and hatefully than usual when right-wing or quasi-right wing fictional media presents itself, such as &#8220;24&#8221; (when it used to be great), &#8220;Song of the South&#8221; (Disney is just now getting around to releasing it to DVD   &mdash;   their previous position was that only enlightened and progressive film students should see it, because us schmucks can&rsquo;t be trusted to see it without wanting to run right out and re-institute slavery.)</p>
<p>They know how the left gains steam because of fiction, and are therefore scared about the right doing the same.</p>

		<p>Funny how the mainstream media, which is the main vehicle of hatred toward white communities, gives the public all the information and hints they need to know to discover the truth.  And yet the public is still oblivious to reality.  I wonder how many New Yorkers stare black/Hispanic crime in the face every day - but, since they watch &#8220;Law and Order&#8221; it never occurs to them that whites are more law-abiding.  Obviously the masses are too stupid or too brainwashed to connect the dots.  So we must aggressively do it for them.  We must be VOCAL in public places.  Over time, I&rsquo;ve trained myself to speak loudly, over the phone, about the virtues of white society while in public.  Today I got some stares but hey, I don&rsquo;t care.  We must plant seeds in the minds of people.  Positive seeds and many of them.  If we do that, some of those seeds will blossom later on.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve witnessed this first hand. I teach history, and one of my favorite units is discussing the Greeks in the Persian wars. Before the movie 300 came out, students found my lecture on the battle of Thermopylae riveting stuff. Even slackers listened up, and would talk about it after class. Once the movie came out, all they could associate with it was the bologne they saw in the movie. Perhaps that&rsquo;s the point of Hollywood, though I can&rsquo;t totally complain. The movie 300 was very pro-Western in outlook, and gets young men fired up about standing up for themselves, something sorely needed these days.</p>

		<p> Of course, sometimes there are movies where historical truth is told, only to be denied with great heat because it isn&rsquo;t politically correct.</p>
<p> A good example is D.W. Griffith&rsquo;s classic &#8220;The Birth Of A Nation,&#8221; where blacks are shown as many of us believe they really behaved when given control of Southern legislatures during Reconstruction: Arrogant, irresponsible, drinking at their desks   &mdash;   in short, behaving just like a bunch of mostly field hands could be expected to behave when suddenly pronounced &#8220;legislators.&#8221;</p>
<p> That&rsquo;s just one example from the movie, which the leftists have denounced as &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;biased&#8221; ever since it was released in 1915. As Woodrow Wilson is said to have remarked about it, &#8220;All too sadly true.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is only true for the weak minded and lazy.  Dumber people are more easily influenced and led.  This is why the influence of Hollywood is so very POWERFUL.</p>
<p>Movies are for entertainment only.  If it presents itself as anything more, than it should be followed up with research before a conclusion is drawn.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hardly news that visual media have the strongest effect on people. Those who watched the 1960 presidential debates on TV overwhelmingly said Kennedy had won, while those who listened to the radio simulcast were just as convinced that Nixon had won.</p>

<p>Just as the lion&rsquo;s share of murderers, rapists, robbers, etc. on <i>CSI: Miami</i> are white, even though there are virtually no whites left in Miami.</p>
<p>More recently, <i>NCIS</i> has killed off the character of the director (played by the very lovely and very white Lauren Holly) and replaced her with a black man who   &mdash;   surprise, surprise!   &mdash;   can give MIT grad McGee a run for his money. Of course such people do exist, but in real life they&rsquo;re about as common as a 4-leaf clover.</p>

<p>After a while, I couldn&rsquo;t help snickering at all the lies and distortions, and one of them walked over and threatened me for breaking the spell of their brainwashing session. Some people are just hopeless.</p>

		<p>intriguingly, many upper middle class whites work in firms with virtually no blacks (engineering, medical fields, biotech, etc.), but nonetheless regard TV as more real than their daily lives.</p>
<p>on TV, the absence of blacks in the higher professions is balanced by a stunning parade of black neurosurgeons, architects, generals, mathematicians, etc.</p>
<p>On TV, whites are always the crude, nasty murderers, blacks aristocratic &amp; sensitive victims&hellip;</p>
<p>Which is real: reality or TV??</p>

		<p>Television is a box full of flickering lights. Staring at a box of flickering lights is called &#8220;hypnosis&#8221;. If anyone doubts this they should know that watching television transforms the viewers brainwaves from Alpha waves to Beta waves. That is a state of hypnosis. The more television one watches the faster and more intense the hypnosis becomes. If you have any sense you&rsquo;ll cut the plug off that sob. And if you can&rsquo;t bring yourself to do that then you&rsquo;re probably addicted to it. Television: the plug-in drug.</p>
<p>By the way, watching internet videos can be just as bad. But READING something on the internet is not. Watching is passive wherease reading is active.</p>

		<p>Of course, we have to depend on Hollywood to tell the true version of historic events. I mean how else would we have learned of the excessive brutality of slavery. That slave owners delighted in mutilating their chattel. Never mind that a trained slave was a valuable commodity, right? Those caring slave owners who provided for freeing their slaves in their will&hellip; Hasn&rsquo;t Hollywood shown us the real truth about that kind of stuff?</p>

		<p>Has anyone been able to stomach seeing this new movie &#8220;District 9&#8221;?  From what I&rsquo;ve read, this is REALLY a piece of propaganda.  I would love to read a review of this movie written by a racially aware person (such as reads this site).  All the critics on RottenTomatoes gush about how this is an allegory about being biased and mean to &#8220;aliens&#8221; (read Mexicans, Blacks, or other minorities).  I need to read a real review by a person with cajones.  Anyone seen such a review? </p>

		<p>I think we can all agree that moving pictures are the wrong medium for informing because the sensation-inducing images and sounds cloud or bias the essential message. If you want to be informed then read.</p>
<p>But even for entertainment the modern world falls short. Present day Hollywood may be the best we can expect. Certainly much of their material is bottom of the barrel sleaze and mind numbingly bankrupt when not offensive. But the entertainment industry is a two way street. The movies we hate continue getting made because they make money. There&rsquo;s a huge market for sleaze and Hollywood satisfies the demand. The symbolism and imagery in modern movies is certainly degenerate more often than not but it&rsquo;s difficult to know how much of it is deliberate social engineering and how much of it simply reflects the tastes and mindset of the average consumer. I&rsquo;m inclined to think the average Joe movie producer is more interested in making a quick buck than in brainwashing the masses; masses who show no signs of pushing back. The oft-maligned production code of Hollywood&rsquo;s Golden Age (1920s – 1950s) was enacted in no small part because the movie-going public demanded it, being of that pre-1960s class who actually knew trash when they saw it. The result was traditional morality, quality entertainment and countless films that have gone on to define everything that used to be great about this country. What if the majority of movie-goers were to demand the same today and threaten a boycott if they didn&rsquo;t get? That shows no signs of happening so I just watch the occasional good movie that comes along and continue to treasure oldies like Judy Garland. <br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Many students expressed their wrong information confidently&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder what MSNBC considers &#8216;correct&rsquo; information?  These days, it&rsquo;s whatever MSNBC and the powerful media tells you it is.</p>
<p> Karl Marx wrote:  &#8216;Die Religion &hellip; ist das Opium des Volkes&rsquo; which translates as &#8216;religion is the opiate of the masses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>TV and movies are the mind-numbing opiate of the 20th century NWO.  They serve as a powerful, leading cultural force as well.  The media do not reflect culture, they make and define culture.</p>
<p>Edmund Connoely writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;By the end of the 1960s, the white Protestant elite and the large Catholic ethnic groups in America had lost the culture wars. Joe McCarthy and the other conservative forces that had kept Hollywood in check had disappeared, with the result that Hollywood was unleashed to embark on its campaign to displace white America&hellip;.which means mainstream gentile society is subjected to withering criticism at all times&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The media, especially TV and movies, combined with an openly anti-White curricula that academia pounds into kids starting at grade K has done untold damage to White culture:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;People are told that their culture is, at its root, sick, violent, and depraved, and this message gives them little confidence in the future of that culture. It also leads them to feel ashamed of their country and to believe that if their society is in decline, it deserves to be&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/qt7ssd</p>
<p>And this from the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; teachers warn students beforehand about the specific historical inaccuracies&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, do you think MSNBC means &#8216;historical inaccuracies&rsquo; such as those presented in &#8216;Roots&rsquo; (believe me this is show EVERY year in EVERY classroom)?  Or maybe such &#8216;historical inaccuracies&rsquo; as black overrepresentation as innovators and geniuses in the fields of medicine, physics, finance and computer technology?  Or maybe they mean black underrepresentation as violent, vicious criminals that prey on Whites (rather than as victims of White crime)?  </p>
<p>Nah, present the real truth in your classroom and you may well find yourself branded as a racist and Nazi and forced to appear in front of a hostile commission for a show trial while you try feebly to defend yourself.  Facts mean nothing to them.  According to SBPDL:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; any conversation about race that paints black people in a negative light, that also relies heavily on documented and irrefutable facts [is] definable as a &#8216;Hate Fact&rsquo; making the debate null and void&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Better to hang a photo of Che behind your desk and teach that the Constitution of the United States is based on the tenants of the Iroquois Nation  &mdash;  after all the Founding Fathers were evil, genocidal, White slave-holders (well, that&rsquo;s what it says in the high school text books).</p>

		<p>The question I still have is what is the mechanism whereby this is happening? This is not coincidence. This is a clearlty orchestrated plan,and who and what is behind it? My own belief is that these are the fruits of seeds planted very early in the cold war. The Soviets saw that the US as it was then constituted was an unbeatable foe. The only way to bring down a society like that was from within. The destruction of all social institutions was initiated. </p>

<p>A pretty good book-although not exactly an easy read-is <i>Hollywood Party</i>,by Ken Billingsley (1998). It does a good job of detailing the takeover of the film workers&rsquo; unions by the CPUSA. (Unions such as the Machinists-responsible for operating and maintaining a lot of the cameras used in film production,and of the union that represented the screen writers,among others)</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t the whole story,by a very big margin,but it does make for a good starting place. Speaking personally,since I&rsquo;m not a historian,and have almost no knowledge of the history of the film industry in the U.S.,I have to wonder how much of a fight the studio heads put up when it should have been obvious to the most blockheaded individual imaginable that rank-and-file production workers were largely members of unions that were dominated by communists. Literal,old fashioned,card-carrying communists,at that,who had the papers to prove it.</p>
<p>This takeover began in the 1930&rsquo;s,if I recall correctly-it&rsquo;s been a long time since I read the book,and just took it off the shelf a few minutes ago to verify the name of the author. I do remember that it covers the McCarthy period,but I can&rsquo;t recall any details.</p>
<p>Incidentally,I was on <i>very</i> bad terms with my high school history teacher for a half a semester when I was still in high school,due to my asking a forbidden question. (Not bad enough to flunk the course,since this was a long time back,and while flunking a student for having politically incorrect views was possible,it wasn&rsquo;t as easy as it is now,and this being a small town,repercussions were at least theoretically possible.)</p>
<p>We were covering the obligatory chapter on The Blacklist and Evil Senator Joe,and we were having described to us the horrors of people who were hounded out of Hollywood for being suspected of communist affiliations. (The pity and the woe!!! Some of them had to even drive their own cars until their names got cleared!!!)</p>
<p>So,dumb teenager that I was,I stuck my hand up and asked if they really had been communists. And explained that If I had been Lenin,Stalin,Hitler,or anyone else who was an enemy of the U.S.,and I had a chance to get a foothold in the industry that did a lot to shape popular perceptions,I&rsquo;d have at the very least made a strong effort to do just that. Who wouldn&rsquo;t,after all? It made perfect sense to me that communists would try and take over  the popular media,and I was young enough and naive enough to believe that I would get an honest answer to what was an honest question. </p>
<p>The teacher,to say the least,wasn&rsquo;t impressed,but all the gods be thanked,the course exams had almost nothing in the way of essay questions,and this was pretty close to school letting out for summer,and I escaped without having my brains scrubbed. In fact,they didn&rsquo;t even manage to dull the pointy part of my head very much,although I remember more than one dirty look. :)</p>

<p>It is sad to note that many of these same Am Renners will protest the beneficial effectiveness of positive subliminal programming.</p>

		<p>J. Erie:  You&rsquo;re a bit factually challenged.  The Hays Production Code wasn&rsquo;t instituted until 1934, which obviously had nothing to do with any movies made before then.  And this code was enforced on the inside by Hollywood&rsquo;s code office and on the outside by an aggressive Catholic Church-backed laymen&rsquo;s group called the Legion of Decency.  The idea that the vast majority of Americans &#8220;demanded&#8221; such a code flies in the face of reality.  If people went to the movies, it was because there wasn&rsquo;t any other choice, not because of any love of what amounted to private-sector censorship.  </p>
<p>In any event, the result of the Hays Code was not better cinema, but much worse.  The movies of the last 20 years in particular (a subject, I dare say you little of) have been gratifying.  Clint Eastwood, the Coen Brothers, Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, Curtis Hanson, Ron Howard, David Fincher, Sam Raimi, Lasse Hallstrom   &mdash;   yes, these filmmakers, and others, are pretty good reasons to go to the movies.</p>

&#8220;I think we understand now just how the media conditions White people. It&rsquo;s not just movies either. It&rsquo;s news reports, sit coms, TV shows, documentaries with false information, newspapers, advertisements in newspapers and magazines, advertisements in the street and photos that work on our unconscious minds. It&rsquo;s amazing White people haven&rsquo;t all given themselves up for reverse slavery yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>To take what you said a stop further. Have you seen the commercial for an alarm system9 I think it&rsquo;s Slomins&rsquo;s Shield where a White husband is walking up to his house and a large Black technician is coming from the house and as he passes the husband he say with a visibly surly expression on his face &#8220;Enjoy your new alarm system&#8221;. The husband approaches the house and greets his wife but  she ignores him because she&rsquo;s busy giddily waving goodbye to and smiling at the Black Slomin guy like a teenage girl at a rock concert. Maybe I&rsquo;m a sick twisted freak(to quote Glenn Beck) but there was almost the suggestion that the Black had done more than install the system.</p>
<p>The husband, mousy and less masculine looking (of course) than the Black tech, remarks that he hopes the the system works so she leaves him outside and begins alarming all the doors. As the scene ends it&rsquo;s night and dark and the husband is still outside begging his wife to disarm the system and let him in.<br>
 I was outraged to the point where I wanted to go and cancel my account with Slomin. The reason I didn&rsquo;t was purely for my own convenience.<br>
Curiously when I&rsquo;ve called Slomins for a service issue I NEVER had a Black tech. come to the house.</p>
