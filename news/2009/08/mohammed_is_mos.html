			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruno Waterfield, London Telegraph (London), August 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Information collected by the country&rsquo;s social security agency has found that traditional Dutch names have been displaced in the urban centres of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht as the country&rsquo;s Muslim population grows.</p>
<p>In The Hague variations of the name Mohammed have taken first, second and fifth place in the Dutch capital&rsquo;s league table of most popular names for boys, replacing traditional favourites such as Jan, Luuk, Gijs or Daan.</p>
<p>At a national level the name Mohammed is now the 16th most popular name for boys.</p>
<p>The figures, obtained by the Dutch Elsevier magazine, from the Dutch Social Insurance Bank, or Sociale Verzekeringsbank (SVB), are different from the official statistics which have in the past counted various spellings of Mohammed, Muhamed, or Muhammad as different names.</p>
<p>Previous government name counts, separating the different versions, have avoided controversy by keeping the name of Islam&rsquo;s founder outside the Dutch top 20 of favourite names for baby boys.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders, leader of the far-Right, anti-Islam Freedom Party, which is currently leading the Dutch opinion polls, has demanded a government investigation following the Daily Telegraph&rsquo;s Aug 8 report that over a fifth of the European Union&rsquo;s population has been forecast to be Muslim by 2050.</p>
<p>Dutch cabinet ministers will on Friday discuss 79 parliamentary questions tabled by his Freedom Party concerning levels of &#8220;non-Western immigration&#8221; and its impact on Dutch society.</p>
<p>Official statistics show that European societies are being transformed by immigration and demographic trends. In 2008 just five per cent of the EU&rsquo;s total population was Muslim. But low birth rates among Europe&rsquo;s indigenous population and rising immigration are having rapid and widespread effects on the population mix.</p>
<p>Recent studies have indicated that fears over the radicalisation of young Muslims have been exaggerated however. Nonetheless the changing population poses policy questions in a range of areas from education and housing to the arts and foreign affairs.<br>

<p>Keep in mind that this figure refers to the entire European Union, which covers many Easter European countries like Poland, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Hungary and the Baltic countries. All of them have rejected multiculturalism so far and thus still remain white and homogeneous. This fact alone pushes the EU-Muslim-percentage down. If it were for Western Europe, I bet the percentage would be at &gt;7%.</p>

		<p>Eastern Europe defended Europe for hundred of years against the Otoman Empire, we don&rsquo;t have any mosque or muslim population, we know what they are.<br>
Western Europe welcomed millions of muslims, when the time comes we will have to defend Western Europe again.<br>
The Dutch, French, English are cowards and traitors.<br>
Most of the mulattoes live in England, France, Netherlands, this says it all.<br>

<p>You go Geert!!! Gof bless you but you&rsquo;re like another Dutch boy with his finger in the dike. <br>
The population of the EU is in a coma and will never wake up in time to save itself but we Yanks aren&rsquo;t far behind. </p>

		<p>&#8216;Just 5% of the EU&rsquo;s population is muslim&rsquo;.<br>
Amrenners!, You must be very, very wary of such statements - herein lies a great danger.<br>
For example, no doubt in the mid sixties/early seventies &#8216;only 5% of California was Mexican&rsquo;, hence there was no need to worry(!).</p>

		<p>Eastern Europe will be next if they aren&rsquo;t careful and its already happening to an extent. The EU means that is difficult to stop it if it does.<br>
I have hopes the Dutch can lead the counter revolution, Wilders could make a real breakthrough in the next election and repatriation will begin.</p>

		<p>As long as Europe has low birth rates, many muslims will be needed to do manual labor and eventually low level service jobs. The few North Africans who have PHds will also find employment. Just not enough white bodies. </p>
<p>This is a much greater problem than Latinos doing work no one else allegedly will do in the US, where whites and blacks theoretically can fill most jobs. (Our problem is black laziness, so we import Latinos).</p>
<p>Also, with all the assimilation problems of Latinos, they pale compared with the similar problem of assimilation of Islam in Europe. An awful religion to cooexist with and build an integrated society. Can&rsquo;t be done.</p>

		<p>The problem I have with Geert is that he&rsquo;s only against multiculturalism, not multiracialism.</p>
<p>I secretly thinks he understands the problem, but he just doesn&rsquo;t say anything about it openly (that would be a vote loser), as he did call the youths &#8216;moroccan street terrorists&rsquo; and not muslim ones.  However it still doesn&rsquo;t explain why he didn&rsquo;t join an alliance with the BNP.  Though I hear that was more Lega Nords fault than his.</p>

		<p>Suicidal. I just don&rsquo;t get this infatuation with multicultuturalism or the desire to bring non whites into western countries. It can only end badly for whites. Why can&rsquo;t anyone see this? I have no problem with bringing in a few brilliant non whites ( I mean folsk who will ad value to society) but this flood will doom our race. I beleive the US will crumble under the weight of differing races eventualy. And it would be nice if Europe was still a bastion for whites to flee to. I suspect Russia will be the last stand for whites.</p>

		<p>Well it really is sad to see that Nick Griffin of the BNP was UNABLE to get even ONE member of the EU Parliment to join him in a call for a block to all immigration into Europe.</p>
<p>This shows that the Front National of France, the NDP of Germany and every other pro European party is purely imaginary.  They must have all been bought off, huh?</p>
<p>And uh the Dutch women will not have the children of a Dutchman.  Nonwhites only.</p>

<p>But the answer is NOT to make more white babies, it is to allow LESS non-whites into Europe and the world.  The reason is that the world population cannot go on growing indefinately.  Quantity is always the enemy of quality.  The intelligent whites in the world need to wake up and collude to limit populations in Africa, South America, Asia, India, etc., before the entire earth goes under - while they still have the chance.  If not, I guarantee all that the human population will crash violently, through war and disease, within one hundred years.  I expect this sooner than later, however.</p>

<p>The two worlds clashed in eastern europe for centuries. The occupation of central and estern hungary did last 150 years long. (In the balkans it even did last 500 years) On the free and even on the occupied territories every collaboration with the enemy was forbidden. this included showing directions to muslims, selling christian property to muslims, using the muslim justice system, picking up muslim customs (anything what would weaken the national and christian identity and cohesion) etc. justice was swift and hard. To get an idea please look at the pictures under.:<br>

<p>Needless to say, after 150 years of turkish occupation, we do not speak turkish, we are christians, we do not look like turks. <br>
Even those balkan states could preserve their identity where the occupation lasted 500 years&hellip;</p>
<p>I hope those fights were not in vain</p>

		<p>This mythology about labor shortage is old and tired. Europe has double digit unemployment. If there was a labor shortage the unemployment rate would be much lower. Furthermore, semi-literate third world immigrants will not be employable in the industries that characterize modern economies. Labor shortages are not driving immigration, its just that simple. This is a Big Lie that must be exposed. There is enough EUROPEAN surplus labor within the EU. </p>
