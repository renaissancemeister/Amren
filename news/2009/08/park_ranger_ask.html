			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Fimrite, San Francisco Chronicle, August 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson [Shelton Johnson], one of a scarce few African American park rangers in the United States, said a black American celebrity publicly frolicking in the woods would do more to help people of color embrace their heritage than all the money in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Johnson, a musician, storyteller and interpretive specialist at Yosemite National Park, is determined to inspire young inner-city African Americans to experience what he says transformed his life. Less than 1 percent of the visitors to Yosemite are African American, a number he&rsquo;s eager to improve.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s bigger than just African Americans not visiting national parks. It&rsquo;s a disassociation from the natural world,&#8221; said Johnson, who has worked in Yosemite for the past 15 of his 22 years in the Park Service. &#8220;I think it is, in part, a memory of the horrible things that were done to us in rural America.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rejection of the natural world by the black community, he said, is a scar left over from slavery.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Early years</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was there [Yosemite National Park], in 2001, that ranger Johnson made the discovery that changed his understanding of the black experience. Deep in the archives he found a faded 1899 photograph of five U.S. Army cavalry troopers on horseback patrolling a pine forest deep in the Yosemite backcountry. The soldiers were African American.</p>
<p>He learned that, for three years, Army troops from the Presidio known as buffalo soldiers had patrolled Yosemite and Sequoia national parks. He became engrossed in their story, reading the soldiers&rsquo; archived letters.</p>
<p>Johnson has since taken on the persona of one of the soldiers and tells the story of the buffalo soldier and his own Native American heritage to youth groups and tourists through that character. The musical presentations bring to life the forgotten history of the black American soldiers who essentially became America&rsquo;s first national park rangers.</p>
<p><b>Spot in documentary</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Race is the core of this history, the heart of this history,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It shows that the national parks are as much a cultural resource as a natural resource.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Johnson cannot seem to break through to the African American community, and, he said, the &#8220;African American intelligentsia&#8221; does not seem willing to step up.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now part of our own problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It bothers me immensely because one of the great losses to African culture from slavery was the loss of kinship with the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it is, he said, so few black Americans visit the parks that he and his colleagues refer to encounters with them as &#8220;sightings.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Finally, black people&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>He said he sees more Africans at the parks. Once, he said, he ran across a group of Kalahari bushmen who were trapped by flooding at Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m thinking, &#8216;finally, black people,&rsquo; &#8221; Johnson said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, the buffalo soldier history is a way of reconnecting African Americans to the land that shaped our consciousness,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;You don&rsquo;t have to go back to Africa to reconnect with nature, to understand its value and to know that it is an essential part of our shared history. It is right here.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I do a lot of hiking and have also noticed that it&rsquo;s very unusual to see blacks while engaging in this activity. </p>
<p>Unlike &#8220;African-American&#8221; park ranger Shelton Johnson, however, I&rsquo;ve never seen that as a problem. </p>

		<p>I appreciate your good intentions, Mr. Johnson but we really don&rsquo;t want to encourage more blacks to visit national parks.  If they come on their own accord, then fine.  Most likely they are nature-lovers and will be respectful.  But if they come because it&rsquo;s part of some &#8220;disadvantages youth&#8221; project or social program, then we don&rsquo;t need those kinds of blacks in wilderness areas.  They will add to the &#8220;naturalness&#8221; of the place to be sure - in the sense that they will prey upon innocent white women visitors like wolves prey upon sheep. </p>

		<p>And if blacks don&rsquo;t come?  Then I suppose that national parks are secretly racist.  The Federal judiciary will order that Yosemite be paved over to build affordable housing and liquor stores.  Then blacks will show up.</p>

<p>  Well I thought whites treated blacks badly everywhere in America! Why then would they not reject the entire country and board a ship back to Africa, where they can get in touch with the earth once again.</p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t visit national parks because of slavery? That may be the most absurd thing I have ever heard in my life. Is there ANYTHING blacks do or don&rsquo;t do because of &#8220;the legacy of slavery&#8221;?  Actually blacks seem to have little or no interest in nature or the environment. I have been involved in numerous environmental causes over the years. Funny&hellip; I never really thought of it before now, but I can&rsquo;t recall EVER seeing a black face at any meeting, rally, conference or organization I attended.</p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t like the national parks system because they can&rsquo;t get anything out of it. In other words, there is no monetary benefit for them, no gub&rsquo;ment cheese pouring into their hands from Uncle Sam. </p>
<p>National parks are a social program that White people pay dearly for through their taxes. White people also love to visit these parks to camp, explore and reconnect with their primal side. In other words, national parks tend to benefit white people. </p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t care for nature. They fear it. Blacks hate camping because it requires some semblance of skill and effort. Blacks are fearful of snakes, lizards and other wildlife. Blacks don&rsquo;t need to go back to nature to get in touch with their primal side because they live out their primal side every day in the &#8220;urban jungle&#8221; and terrorize everyone. </p>

		<p>Ahh but the Buffalo soldiers waged war on the innocent Native American Tribes! A tad hypocritical ain&rsquo;t it, to complain about oppression of Blacks and then celebrate the oppression of Native peoples?</p>
<p>I guess  this just another case of the hierarchy of favored groups in action, you know all minorities are special (compared to whites!) but some minorities are even more special (Africans, Muslims) then others (Asians, Hispanics, gays) and when conflicts between the two arise make sure the more special group is the hero/victim and the less special minority is the villain/oppressor!<br>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks avoid national parks &mdash; it&rsquo;s a legacy of slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or is it a legacy of 5000 years of primitive times they would rather not deal with, since they&rsquo;re now in a society where the toilets are on the inside and they can be flushed, and it isn&rsquo;t necessary getting cut and bruised stumbling through the brush trying to find something to eat?</p>
<p>I would venture to say that the &#8220;outdoors&#8221; reminds them too much of the old country.</p>

It is reprehensible that after 150 years of emancipation that blacks still blame Whites for every thing that is wrong in the black community or every thing that blacks do not do or patronize. </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine how horrible our parks would be if visits by African-Americans became frequent. Ghetto blacks haven&rsquo;t a clue how to behave in a quiet, natural setting. I can hear the screaming, the thumping woofers, the gunshots in my mind as I type, and it ain&rsquo;t pretty. Here in Eugene Oregon, two U of O athletes (black, of course) were recently caught shooting ducks in the park with a BB gun. I was amazed at how quickly the diversity fanatics turned on these ghetto hoodlums. Even in liberal Eugene, &#8220;Whitey&#8221; don&rsquo;t take kindly to animal abuse. God help us if these types invade our National Parks. And since when are blacks in Africa veritable John Muir type naturalists? The only ones who appreciate nature on the dark continent are people like Jane Goodall. </p>

		<p>Urban blacks are terrified of water, trees and lightly populated areas. They need noise and overcrowding. Their kids are utterly connected to junk hip hop by ipods. They chat on cell phones all day. They have no idea where anything came from. </p>
<p>Frankly, the beauty and silence of nature would be violently disrupted if the govt decided to truck in a bunch of black schoolkids to connect them with nature. They&rsquo;d burn down a forest before they were done to relieve their being &#8220;bored&#8221;. Good riddance. We don&rsquo;t want them in our parks. </p>
<p>And I doubt many &#8220;Africans&#8221; show up in our parks either, If they did, they&rsquo;d be killing endangered species as they do in Africa.</p>

		<p>I recently spent a weekend at the YMCA Trout Lodge in southern Missouri. Trout Lodge is wilderness lodge on the edge of a small lake, with horseback riding, hiking trails, an alpine tower,etc. There was a large black family reunion using the lodge and conference center facilities. Not once during the whole weekend did I notice any black guests bring children to the pony rides, or attempt any horseback riding, or attempt the alpine tower or zip line, or use the hiking trails through the woods. Some did use the swimming area, but they did not enter the deep water. No black child attempted the swim test that allowed them to swim in the deep end and use the rope swing. A couple tried archery, but didn&rsquo;t stay long. Nobody used a kayak, or a pedal boat or a canoe or a sailboat. Why not? I suppose it must be the fault of white people somehow. But none of the black people seemed to be interested in any of these activities. It wasn&rsquo;t like they wanted to do these things but were held back by the racism of the white guests, or the legacy of slavery. But what do I know?</p>

		<p>Understandably, Ranger Johnson would likely disagree with me, but I find the lack of racial diversity to be one of the most appealing things about a day in the woods.  Imagine strolling a shady path and coming across a half dozen saggy pants boys, yipping and snarling. I&rsquo;d rather meet a bear.</p>

The only way to attract blacks to &#8216;nature&rsquo; is to make nature &#8216;urban&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the effort by black groups to get blacks to ski. To do this, they have to bring in urban djs to blast urban music.</p>
<p>When dealing with blacks, it&rsquo;s all so pointless.<br>

		<p>Blacks are terrified of bears.  They don&rsquo;t like to camp.  They are terrified of snakes.  What appeal does Yosemite have for them?</p>
<p>Also, is it really a problem is blacks don&rsquo;t like nature or visiting national parks?  Is it a problem if hispanics don&rsquo;t go to hockey games?  What about asians to the beach?  I thought at least part of the hard-to-pin-down magic of diversity was  celebrating our differences, not lamenting the fact that everyone isn&rsquo;t using Yosemite identically.</p>
<p>I love Yosemite, and go a few times a year.  It&rsquo;s within a few hours drive of millions of Californians of every stripe.  It&rsquo;s cheap to get in, and you can bring your own food, drinks, etc., so the man doesn&rsquo;t gouge you like at an And1 exhibition or rap concert.  If blacks aren&rsquo;t there, it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t want to be there, and there&rsquo;s no harm in that.  There were no Japanese or German bufallo soldiers, but they apparently feel connected to Yosemite in such a way that you hear their tongues all over the park.</p>
<p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s probably the only place in he world where if something black breaks into your car, it&rsquo;s a bear and not a bantu.  If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.</p>

		<p>I think this guy is full of bull. It wasn&rsquo;t slavery that seperated blacks from nature it was welfare. When I was young many blacks from the city would come to the country to go hunting and fishing. They were not welcome in those days but you still couldn&rsquo;t keep them off your land. All you had to do was put up a no tresspassing sign and you would have 20 blacks out in your cow pasture shooting at anything that moved. They would be drinking and cursing and having a good old time. </p>
<p>Then there was the Great Society of LBJ. The blacks stopped hunting and fishing and started doing drugs and wearing gold chains. You can&rsquo;t go hunting with 10 pounds of gold around your neck it gets caught on tree limbs. If you go fishing and fall in the water you are sure to drown. </p>
<p>The real reason blacks don&rsquo;t go to parks is because they are afraid of not looking cool. Country living is associated with being white. It&rsquo;s a  darn good thing because we need some place that&rsquo;s safe. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bigger than just African Americans not visiting national parks. It&rsquo;s a disassociation from the natural world,&rdquo; said Johnson, who has worked in Yosemite for the past 15 of his 22 years in the Park Service. &ldquo;I think it is, in part, a memory of the horrible things that were done to us in rural America.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;   This is preposterous on its face.  I&rsquo;ve been to many historic sites and rarely, if ever, have I seen Blacks.  To give you one example;  I visited West Point on one occasion.  I say Orthodox Jews, a few Hispanics (handful) and even Chinese.  I did not see one Black.  Another example would be Hyde Park, NY the home and burial place of FDR.  Again, similar scenario - NO BLACKS.  I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re interested in such things.  They might be more interested in activities like standing on the street corner wheelin&rsquo; an&rsquo; dealin&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>So&hellip;going to a national park, in a part of the country where slavery never existed, to see elk, buffalo and bear, animal which most blacks(slave or free)have never laid eyes upon, to commune with nature in all its grandeur, etc&hellip;is too traumatic an experience for Blacks&hellip;because of slavery?!? </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;We are now part of our own problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It bothers me immensely because one of the great losses to African culture from slavery was the loss of kinship with the earth.&#8221;/i&gt;</i></p>
<p>It sure is funny how <i>everything</i> concerning blacks is a legacy of slavery.  So plowing fields, picking cotton, and logging timberlands not only causes a person to lose his kinship with the earth, but the deficit is heritable.</p>
<p>I think our national parks are much nicer places due to not having many blacks in them.  In state parks that have become popular with blacks I&rsquo;ve noticed that they can&rsquo;t have a simple picnic without bringing along their ghetto blasters and making an intolerable noise.  </p>

		<p>The purported reason that blacks do not visit the national parks because of slavery is utterly ludicrous.  I would venture to say that virtually no one, black or white, has even heard of this theory, and even if they did would it if affect their personal perceptions in &hellip;. 2009????</p>
<p>My personal experience with blacks is that most of them do not appreciate nature, and are intimidated by its magnitude and unpredicability.  Simply put, they do not get it, and they do not like it. </p>
<p>Just being being born and raised in an urban setting does not explain their orientation.  For example, I was raised in a totally urban setting in apartments and we never went on vacations.  Yet, I looked at pictures of mountains and deserts and longed of the day when I could hike among them.  And when I grew up, I did so with a vengence.</p>
<p>This is just another futile attempt to bring blacks to the white &#8220;norm&#8221;.  However, what is normal for whites may not be normal for blacks.</p>

The theory that slavery has scarred blacks to the point of shunning the outdoors is ludicrous at best and shows how far blacks will go to include &#8220;racism&#8221; as their go-to excuse and default program because even the least intelligent of their  group knows if they yell racism, cultural &#8220;scarring&#8221; etc., ad nauseum, then they will get their handout from the guilt tripping melting pot magpies and diversity dingbats. </p>

This is a tie-in for a new series on National Parks by Ken Burns:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/nationalparks/" rel="nofollow">https://www.pbs.org/nationalparks/</a></p>
<p>I have no doubt the Mr. Burns will likewise prove that National Parks were conceived, built, and maintained by blacks who were later driven out by racist white folk.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The musical presentations bring to life the forgotten history of the black American soldiers who essentially became America&rsquo;s first national park rangers.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Watch for this convoluted and contorted factoid to make it&rsquo;s way into black history consciousness.</p>

		<p>A national park is one of the few places in America that a white woman can feel safe sleeping in a tent, wandering down a trail alone or sitting with her back to a tree watching wildlife (of the 4-legged, furry type). Try that in E. St. Louis! I don&rsquo;t know what the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; has to do with keeping blacks out of National Parks, but I&rsquo;m grateful for it.  </p>

They were busy looking for where the chains were attached to the wall.  If it&rsquo;s white, it&rsquo;s automatically bad.  </p>

However, as horrible as it may sound, we all know that when one moves in, you can expect a horde and when you have a horde of blacks, there goes the neighborhood and so would go our national parks.</p>

		<p>   It&rsquo;s strange that black people started out as a rural people in the deep South. One could frequently find them fishing or hunting in the woods. Somehow they&rsquo;ve become primarily an urban people outside of their home areas in the South. I&rsquo;m not sure why this happened and the change, for blacks at least, has not been for the better. I generally like the friendly rural blacks better than their urban cousins. I also find fewer blacks in the State Parks today than thirty five years ago.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks are fearful of snakes, lizards and other wildlife&#8221;<br>
Blacks are fearful of bees, beetles, and even houseflies.  They are also afraid of city parks, even quite small totally manicured parks except for the basketball courts.</p>
<p>I once was sitting on a bench waiting for  my son who was playing basketball. A black woman whose 5 year old left the toddlers playground yelled at him to &#8220;get away from those bushes there might be a snake there.&#8221;  Yeah right.</p>
<p>You see blacks on the basketball court and in the sand boxes and little kids playgrounds.  But you seldom see them anywhere else in the park.  Even in large parks with preserved wilderness areas like Griffith Park or Baldwin Hills Park in Los Angeles, you never see a black away from the playground, picnic area or basketball court.</p>
<p>Baldwin Hills Park in Los Angeles is actually a huge state park in its natural state.  It is located in South Los Angeles which once was a totally black area.  Every once in a while there is an article in the papers like this one, bemoaning the fact that the blacks who live right next to the park don&rsquo;t go there.</p>
<p>Some black children are taken to Baldwin Hills Park on school field trips.  All they do is complain that they have to walk, they are thirsty, it is hot or cold, their shoes will get dirty, bears and wolves will attack them  etc.</p>

		<p>Back in the 60s, when my family was poor, our parents and their siblings used to rent cabins at a nearby state park.  We were in a heavily black part of the South, but back then, the parks were segregated (I suppose).  It was wonderful.  Alligators, snakes, lizards, turtles&hellip;.all the things white kids find irresistible were there in abundance.  Too, there were paddle-wheel boats you could pedal through the swamps, basketball courts&hellip;endless things for a fun outing.</p>
<p>Today, we still rent cabins there when we gather in &#8220;the old country&#8221; (the local motels are too scary, with all-black staff, and mostly-black clientele, in black-run towns).  It&rsquo;s still peaceful.  But the paddle-wheel boats, the basketball courts, the tennis courts&hellip;.are all GONE.  Why?  Because when the park became integrated, black day-trippers destroyed all those things.  It was judged futile and unwise to try to replace damaged equipmen, when it became clear that the new demographic would destroy the replacements almost immediately.</p>
<p>Fine with us.  We&rsquo;re there for the snakes and gators, anyway.  What few blacks now come (once all the game opportunities were destroyed, they had nothing to do) just use the barbecue facilities, and do not venture beyond the areas of mown grass.  They mostly just eat and listen to black radio.  Needless to say, most are built like Manatees, with all that endless eating, and swilling big bottles of pink and orange soda.</p>
<p>These are rural and small-town Southern blacks.  Mostly harmless, there with family groups, and they leave at dusk.  But bringing in hardened inner-city youths, without their parents, to stay for a week or so?  That&rsquo;s nothing but a recipe for gang-rape.  There have already been mass-robberies/beatdowns of whites, by blacks, in parks.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not only Blacks who shun the parks. I live in San Francisco and the residential areas in the western half of the city have been largely taken over by the Chinese. Golden Gate Park divides two heavily (2/3) Asian neighborhoods. The people enjoying the park are probably 95% white. Ditto with the people walking along Ocean Beach.</p>
<p>My Chinese neighbor was very happy when I cut down some trees in my yard to let in some sunlight (I still have lots of trees). She told me how much better it looked and said, &#8220;We Chinese, we don&rsquo;t like too many trees&#8221;. No surprise, she has chopped down all the trees in her yard and covered her &#8220;lawn&#8221; with cement bricks.</p>
<p>Lots of Chinese in my neighborhood pave their front and back yards. I really believe their are racial differences in the ability to appreciate nature.</p>

		<p>I enjoy cycling along Minnesota&rsquo;s trails. 99% of riders are white. Occasionally, an Asian or two is seen. In all the years I have been biking on this one trail near the Twin Cities I have seen one black man. He was a muscular guy who was biking bare chested. I remember how odd it seemed. He was with a buxom white woman, kind of chunky, with a skimpy top on; for all the world they looked like a stripper out for an afternoon with her &#8220;man&#8221;. They were staying near the trail in an RV.<br>
I have seen a few Indian computer types on the trail. They were riding slowly on dumb - looking clunkers. They were riding slowly so they could use their cameras on their cell phones to record the trees, hills, etc. Geeky.<br>

 &ldquo;Blacks are fearful of snakes, lizards and other wildlife&rdquo;. &#8220;Blacks are fearful of bees, beetles, and even houseflies. They are also afraid of city parks, even quite small totally manicured parks    &mdash;   except for the basketball courts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I once was sitting on a bench waiting for my son who was playing basketball. A black woman whose 5 year old left the toddlers playground yelled at him to &ldquo;get away from those bushes there might be a snake there.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;You see blacks on the basketball court and in the sand boxes and  playgrounds. But &hellip;.you will never see a black away from the playground, picnic area or basketball court.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>That is a very interesting observation.  There may be something deeply genetic that is involved.  I remember reading in some French book or article, years ago, a similar observation, regarding the difference in attitudes toward  Nature between Africans and Europeans.  I think this was particularly in regard to the bleakness of the  immigrant housing projects that surround French cities, a bleakness caused and preferred by the immigrants themselves.  These  apartments were designed by a benevolent government to be garden communities.   But Africans, unlike Europeans, have no fondness for flowers and trees and shrubs. They don&rsquo;t  want them! They don&rsquo;t like them!</p>
<p>The writer made the perceptive comment that in Europe, where the climate is cool and the growing season short,  Mother Nature has to  be coaxed and cultivated to be gotten to bloom.   In Africa, with its hot climate and 12-month growing season, Nature is riotous and has to be constantly chopped back and gotten under control.  </p>
<p>A hut in an African village is surrounded by bare earth or sand  which has been stamped down and every blade of grass extinguished around it.   That&rsquo;s how they want it.  The reason, it was explained, is that to an African, grass and bushes represent snakes, scorpions, insects &hellip; therefore they don&rsquo;t want any greenery near their houses.  A  European cottage, on the other hand, is surrounded by flowers and gardens that have been  lovingly tended and encouraged to grow.   This presents a cozy scene to a European.  It is a threatening one to an African.</p>
<p>It is a completely different mind set!   Africans do not comprehend the European love of Nature.  To them it is irrational.  To Africans, Nature is the perpetual enemy that needs to be beaten down and controlled, not encouraged.</p>
<p>This explanation makes good sense to me.   Needless to say, any silly attempt to describe this as another &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; is uttermost nonsense. </p>
<p>Oh, one other case.  I recall, too, a story told me by a black woman I knew.  Her mother had moved into an apartment on the Grand Concourse, in the Bronx, in what was once considered a luxury building on  the former  &#8220;Jewish Champs-Élysées&#8221;.    After Jews moved out, blacks moved in, and the once-flourishing flower beds and grass became all torn up by the kids, turned to bare dirt, were garbage-strewn, and eventually were paved over by the landlord with concrete.  She blamed this on the indifference of the landlord who no longer took care of the property once blacks lived there.  I held my tongue, but wondered if it was the landlord who had strewn the garbage, trampled the flower beds and reduced them to dirt. Somehow, I doubted it.  I suspect he just gave up.</p>

		<p>1. Appreciating nature requires the capacity for abstract thought, which most blacks do not have in abundance.<br>
2. The wildlife is not the rats and roaches that they are used to.<br>
3. The lack of litter is also unnerving to them in well maintained park areas.<br>
4. Escalades with the low-profile tires and spinners bottom out to easily on most dirt roads.<br>
5. Blacks are absolutely TERRIFIED of snakes.<br>
6. You have to plan ahead. There is no convenience store down the black to buy a single beer or a single cigarette. There is no KFC to get fried chicken prepared by somebody else. In the woods, you have to be organized and figure out what to bring with you, or you will get hungry and wet. Blacks do not think of the future the same way as whites do, and have trouble making and fulfilling such plans. <br>
7. Blacks and Mexicans can&rsquo;t swim, so water is scary to them.<br>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;In 1980 there was a case in California that led to an outcry not only in that state but across the nation.

		<p>If blacks have the money for a vacation, they like to go somewhere warm AND luxurious where they will be waited on by others.  That is their idea of a good time, and also their idea of a high-status vacation.  </p>
<p>Lots of whites would choose camping, fishing, hunting, sailing, etc., as their first choice of how to spend vacation time, EVEN IF they could afford to go anywhere and do anything.  Blacks see camping and hiking as something you MIGHT do if you can&rsquo;t afford anything else.  And even a successful camping trip requires that you save up some money for a tent, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, etc.  </p>
<p>In addition to their inability to swim, and fearfulness of nature, there is probably also an aspect of &#8220;too poor to paint, too proud to whitewash.&#8221;  If they have any kind of job that would enable them to purchase camping equipment, they will NOT want to admit to co-workers that they spent their vacation in a tent in the woods, when everybody else has gone on a cruise, or gone to Jamaica.</p>

<p>And so it is.  <br>
But is isn&rsquo;t the cultural norm here, at least not before 1965.</p>
<p>But now, we have animal sacrifices, santeria, bush meat, genital mutilations, child rapes, honor killings, and all sorts of cultural enrichment and thrilling vibrancy which we never formerly could have imagined. Indeed, in this new multiculty mélange, it&rsquo;s hard to say what the cultural standards are anymore. (If there are any.)</p>
<p>Well, that what they multicultists, cosmopolitans, and one-worlders wanted &hellip; and they got it. That cultural chaos should reign supreme in this multi-hued Tower of Babel. That no group should be the majority and impose hegemony on all the rest. </p>

		<p>Blacks produce and distribute garbage around them wherever they go. They have absolutely no respect for nature and if they started going to parks the parks would be trashed almost immediately. As a hiker, I hope that Blacks stay out of our parks so they can remain pristine as our forefathers intended when they set these lands aside so many years ago.</p>
