<h1>At House of Raeford, Far Fewer Latino Workers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Franco Ordoñez, Charlotte Observer, August 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>During a break at a House of Raeford Farms plant in eastern North Carolina, dozens of workers in hairnets and rubber boots mingled outside the large gray factory among scattered turkey feathers.</p>
<p>It was a typical sight except for one thing: Most of the poultry processing workers were African American  &mdash;  not Latino, as they have been for much of the past decade.</p>
<p>House of Raeford, one of the nation&rsquo;s top chicken and turkey producers, appears to be transforming its workforce amid a court fight over federal charges that a subsidiary knowingly hired illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Current and former workers at the company&rsquo;s main plant in Raeford say the firm stopped hiring immigrants in recent months and let hundreds more go for using fake documents.</p>
<p>Once more than 80 percent Latino, the production floor at the Raeford plant is now up to 70 percent African American, workers said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>N.C. workers told the Observer that the company appears to be going down a list of Hispanic employees and firing them in small numbers, so as not to interrupt production. Human resources officials also have been given &#8220;immigration training&#8221; on how to comply with the law, according to a union representative.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>House of Raeford has not, however, signed up for a free federal program, known as E-Verify, that allows companies to verify applicants&rsquo; Social Security numbers, according to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>House of Raeford declined to comment on recent questions about how its workforce has changed. But the company said prisoners make up less than 1/2 of 1 percent of its N.C. workforce  &mdash;  and slightly more in South Carolina.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Hispanics being fired</b></p>
<p>Isabel Hernandez said she was fired on April 21 for working with fake documents. Hernandez and others described what she saw as an organized effort to push illegal immigrants out of the plant  &mdash;  a few at a time  &mdash;  so as not to draw much attention or disrupt operations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The shortage of workers has curtailed production, current workers said. One of the Raeford factories, an older plant, has cut operations to four days a week, workers said. Last year, House of Raeford announced it would begin reducing the number of birds it processed by 5 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But now, with unemployment so high, more Americans are seeking jobs they previously avoided. American-born workers in Raeford say there&rsquo;s no excuse for the company to rely on undocumented labor.</p>

		<p>It must be admitted that many of these undocumented Hispanic workers do work fairly hard.  They certainly were better workers than the Blacks that they&rsquo;ve been fired for.  House of Raeford is going to find out the hard way.  What would have been the problem to hire White workers for their replacements instead of Blacks? Oh that&rsquo;s right I forgot Diversity rules.</p>

		<p>The same thing has happened at Smithfield&rsquo;s Tar Heel, NC pork processing plant on a much larger and dramatic scale.  (world&rsquo;s largest hog slaughterhouse) </p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t noticed price increases on pork or chicken (beef, yes, big time increases) at my grocery store over the past year. </p>
<p>Sugar, on the other hand, has gone through the roof, notwithstanding that the so called &#8220;free&#8221; trade pursuant to NAFTA should have white table sugar (produced in low wage, efficient cane producer Mexico) retailing for about 15 cents per lb. instead of 50 cents per lb.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t want illegals to be able to work ANYWHERE in the U.S. and I would applaud the employer for this move BUT!! NOW he will have more problems with the blacks and their muslim converts/conversions and female muslim dress. No pity here.</p>

		<p>Why should the company have to fire illegals on the QT? They do not belong here. We should not apologize. The only excuse should be, &#8220;you broke into our country (or overstayed your visa) so you don&rsquo;t belong here. Please return to your own country. Don&rsquo;t bother to return, the jobs are going to Americans as they should have all along.&#8221; </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s shocking how the blacks are being replaced.  When the Judiciary ordered Whites to be replaced with blacks, at least they allowed the Whites who had jobs to remain in the jobs.  Blacks were hired on as new workers.  In most workplaces it was obvious what was going on.  Everyone over 50 was White, everyone under 50 was black.</p>
<p>But this is really something.  In my city, the government workers, supermarket workers, security guards, postal workers, delivery people, every kind of job, the blacks have just disappeared.</p>
<p>What goes around comes around.  Shakespeare wrote a line, &#8220;put not your trust in Princes.&#8221;  The blacks should not have put their trust in Judges.</p>
<p>In another 20 years the capitialists will have found even cheaper labor; perhaps Aborigines, and will replace the hispanics.  After all, except for a brief period, about 1925 to 1965, America was built on ceaseless waves of cheaper and cheaper immigrant labor.</p>

<p>Why is she still in this country if she is here illegally? Let me guess she is unemployed, drawing unemployment and collecting  welfare, right? </p>
<p>All the illegals should be fired and deported. </p>

		<p>  I have to admit that some Mexicans are hard workers, but I still favor hiring Americans (black or white) over illegal immigrants. In this case I side with the black workers. </p>

		<p>This company cannot be trusted, given its record, and it should be required to use EVERIFY. The SAVE act, pending in Congress, would require all employers to use EVERIFY. Write/email your congressman-senator about this. Clearly, firing illegals is the way to cleanse the nation in the long run of this stain, along with harsh penalties for cheating employers.</p>

Here&rsquo;s a novel idea: pay a reasonable wage so you can hire folks who will be reliable, work hard, and not cause any trouble.</p>

It&rsquo;s a good idea, but virtually every fruit, vegetable, bean and grain grown in this country is planted, harvested, transported, processed and warehoused by third world rabble.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t eat in restaurants, but it is impossible to purchase food without rewarding the companies that hire illegals.</p>

		<p><i>House of Raeford../../../../__8230.css; appears to be transforming its workforce amid a court fight over federal charges that a subsidiary knowingly hired illegal immigrants.</i></p>
<p>This is the key line. They weren&rsquo;t doing it because it was right. They were doing it because their tails were in a crack. This is evidence that they knew they were guilty all along but didn&rsquo;t clean up until the heat was on them. The way to deal with illegal immigration is to forget about the illegals and go after EMPLOYERS.</p>
<p><i>House of Raeford has not, however, signed up for a free federal program, known as E-Verify, that allows companies to verify applicants&rsquo; Social Security numbers, according to the Department of Homeland Security.</i></p>
<p>This shows that they&rsquo;re not serious about reforming their ways. See, if they starting using E-Verify they couldn&rsquo;t hire the illegals back later after the heat is off.</p>

		<p>Before we get too hasty, let&rsquo;s check the immigration status of the blacks now working there. It&rsquo;s likely that these are not [African} American blacks, but rather African black (albeit legal) imports../../../../__8230.css; Many {African} American blacks are satisfied living on welfare.</p>

		<p>Look, the least that some group fighting against illegal immigration should do is send copies of this article to Senor Jorge Bush, (ex-Presidente of El Norte) and to all the U.S. Chambers of Commerce. These people need articles like this shoved up their faces everytime Americans demostrate that they WILL DO THE JOBS AMERICANS WON&rsquo;T DO.</p>

		<p>Quit complaining and do something about it!  Every time I read the comments posted on this website, all I see is complaining and whining.  Everyone gets on their high horse and never does anything about it.  I bet most of the people that read and post on this AmRen just come here to complain and write about what they think, but when confronted in real life, they cower.  We claim to be the most advanced and intelligent race on earth, but all our countries across the world are being taken over by non-whites.  We have already lost the southwest to the brown people.  The blacks have taken the Presidency.  They are here and they are taking what they want and we sit her like cowards!  We are not the as smart as we thing we all are!  </p>

		<p>#16 Sean I agree. I believe that this forum is very important, because of all the well informed people who post here, that I have learned much from. Their experiences and knowledge are extremely varied on a variety of the topics discussed here. </p>
<p>As to your point about doing something, I believe that something, is to spread the word about all of the knowledge acquired on this forum to anyone that will listen  &mdash;  friends, family, relatives, casual acquaintances,etc. The cumulative mass effect of this would be sufficient to bring about all kinds of eventual change. People can&rsquo;t act, unless they know there is a crisis and so many Americans are so starved for information,in paradoxically, this age of information.</p>
