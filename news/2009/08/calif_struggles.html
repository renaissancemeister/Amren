<h1>Calif. Struggles to Desegregate Its Prison Inmates</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Don Thompson, AP, August 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mindful of that, California has for decades segregated inmates by race in their cells and sleeping areas. In general, whole cell blocks and open dormitories are mixed race.</p>
<p>But four years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court found the practice discriminatory, citing Brown v. Board of Education. The court said it reinforced a cycle of racial hatred and violence and ordered the state to desegregate its prisons.</p>
<p>At the California Institution for Men in Chino, segregation is still in place. The weekend riot started in a dormitory-style housing wing where many races are in a large room, but the sleeping arrangements are segregated. The exact cause of the riot remains under investigation.</p>
<p>All the state prisons were supposed to be integrated by the end of last year, but the process is far behind schedule.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Powerful race-based gangs oppose integration and have threatened inmates who participate. That leads wardens, guards and inmates to predict it will take years to fully integrate the state&rsquo;s 33 prisons, which hold 150,000 inmates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Tim Heffernan, a heavily tattooed 41-year-old white inmate at Sierra Conservation Center] and Daniel Mabson, a 25-year-old black inmate, sat across from each other on bunk beds as they spoke to a reporter about prison race relations and the halting desegregation efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can we comply if it puts our lives in danger?&#8221; Mabson said.</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s inmates are racially diverse: 26 percent white, 29 percent black, 39 percent Hispanic and 6 percent of other races.</p>
<p>Under the new policy, inmates are assigned housing based on their compatibility with members of another race, their age, the type of crime they committed and their physical characteristics. They are given a &#8220;racial eligibility code&#8221; showing their ability to be housed with others.</p>
<p>The department&rsquo;s regulations permit segregating individual inmates if officials can show it is necessary for their safety. For example, members of the Aryan Brotherhood are not housed with members of the Black Guerrilla Family. The divisions even occur within races: Hispanic gang members from Northern California are kept apart from Hispanics from Southern California.</p>
<p>Prisoners also have a long-standing practice of self-segregating.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re a white inmate, you&rsquo;re approached as soon as you get off the bus: Here&rsquo;s where you eat, here&rsquo;s where we stay,&#8221; said Lt. Jimmy Hurtado, of the Sierra Conservation Center. &#8220;It&rsquo;s pretty much at all 33 prisons statewide.&#8221;</p>
<p>But with integration at the Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown and Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, inmates have been required to take the first available bed. The approach was patterned after one adopted in Texas 18 years ago.</p>
<p>The two prisons are being integrated first because they were expected to be among the easiest. Both house gang dropouts, homosexuals, child molesters, the elderly, disabled and mentally ill, who were thought to be more amenable because they need protection from other prisoners. Sierra Conservation Center also houses lower security prisoners who hope to win a coveted transfer to one of the state&rsquo;s 19 inmate firefighting camps that can earn them an early parole.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks, whites and Hispanics were willing to sleep side by side in beds spaced an arm&rsquo;s length apart. But they would rather fight or risk longer sentences than accept an inmate of another race in a bed above or below them in the same bunk.</p>
<p>Inmates consider each tier of bunks like a cell without walls, and that&rsquo;s where they draw an imaginary line.</p>
<p>Inmates who refuse to integrate can lose television, commissary and exercise yard privileges and have their sentences extended up to 90 days. Repeated violations can mean a transfer to a higher-security prison.</p>
<p>Resistance to integration is more about power than it is about race, said Rusty Otto, Sierra Conservation Center&rsquo;s mental health director. The race-based gangs control the flow of contraband and money, who rules each cell house and who gets a share of the profits from crime on the streets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Prisoners are known to blow the place up over little things,&#8221; he [University of North Texas professor Chad R. Trulson, who is advising California on its integration policy] said. &#8220;And race in prison is not a little thing.&#8221;<br>

		<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is some of the very same SCOTUS Justices that ordered CA not to segregate its prisoners, because racial classifications are invalid, are the ones that supported New Haven in the Ricci case.  If there&rsquo;s no such thing as race, then there&rsquo;s no such thing as race.</p>

		<p>I hate to admit it, but I have been to jail, not prison before. I was in a jail in San Bernardino, Ca. for about 2 months. The dorm was racially mixed, but there were rules. You did not use the showers with the other races(blacks and Hispanics). You could play cards and trade food with the Southern Mexicans, but no one else. There was a fight between a White and a Hispanic in the dorm, but it was broken up by the guards very quickly. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine how more messed up it is in the prisons. To desegregate prisons is bad for the Whites. Most Whites that will be placed with the blacks and Hispanics are not White gang members so they might fall prey to the other races. The Whites that will be placed with other Whites will be the hardest White gang members you can imagine so they will be safe. In this case being part of a gang could save your life.</p>

		<p> News items like this show how judges at all levels, secure in their ivory towers, can cause untold problems for us lowly common people who have to live with the consequences of their rulings. Segregation by race, across the board, no exceptions, would eliminate 90 percent of the violence-related problems in American prisons.</p>
<p> A friend of mine, a lay minister who frequently visited local guys at prisons here in Indiana, once told me that, and I&rsquo;ve never seen any reason to doubt him. There comes a time and an issue when governors and state legislatures should tell the Supreme Court (paraphrasing President Andrew Jackson), &#8220;You&rsquo;ve made your ruling   &mdash;   now let&rsquo;s see you enforce it.&#8221;</p>

In theory, these things are supposed to work.</p>
<p>Of course, reality always trumps theory. This is a lesson too many people don&rsquo;t want to believe.</p>

		<p>I think Abraham Lincoln said that the best way to get rid of a bad law is to enforce it rigorously and to the letter.  The Supreme Court decision mandating &#8220;integration&#8221; in prisons is as bad or worse than the horrendous Brown decision (which destroyed public education in the US), and will turn our prisons into &#8220;free-for-all&#8221; jungles if it is enforced to the letter. There is no better way for the Supreme Court to ensure that its writ is eventually ignored.</p>

		<p>Zorba, enforcing a bad law rigorously will only work if it is enforced on everyone, especially the lawmakers.  The problem is the lawmakers live in gated communities and are often exempt from the laws they pass.  Did you know, for instance, that Congressmen can&rsquo;t but sued for discrimination (they can hire an all white staff or all black staff if they want), Congressmen don&rsquo;t pay into social security (they are exempt), and when libs like Ted Kennedy want to move more blacks into white neighborhoods, he doesn&rsquo;t mean his own neighborhood.  </p>

 I know someone who resigned a job as a prison guard in<br>
Wyoming as a result of this insane Supreme Court ruling.</p>
<p> If the thought of integrating prisoners is that daunting<br>
there - in one of the whitest of all states - how bad must<br>
it be in the rest of the prisons in the U.S.</p>

		<p>NPR Radio had a long essay yesterday on the California Dept. of Prisons&hellip; how California&rsquo;s financial woes are exacerbated by the burgeoning prison population. Blaming the high costs of incarceration, predictably, on the prison guards&rsquo;a union.</p>
<p>Since 1968&rsquo;s famous Johnny Cash concert in Folsom Prison, the state&rsquo;s prisoner population swelled and swelled and swelled. The narrators tried to pin it on the &#8220;get tough&#8221; laws voters demanded. Tessay kept dancing around the obvious: That the real problem was the incredible influx of illegal immigrants in Calif., that they and their subsequent anchor babies and the children and grandchildren of those adult anchor babies are responsible for so much of California&rsquo;s crime. The skyrocketing drug problems, gang related crime, etc.</p>
<p>What does it take to wake our politicians up to reality. GET RID OF ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND YOUR CRIME PROBLEM WILL BE CUT IN HALF!<br>

		<p>Perhaps retired Supreme Court justice Dandra Day O&rsquo;Conner should be appointed special master to show the folks in California how their prison system can be successfully desegregated since it was her decision that mandated this process.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this mania to force people to integrate.</p>
<p>If we would allow things to mature naturally, without forcing the issue, we would probably be better along in solving our race problems. As it stands, things are worse now than they ever were and trying to desegregate prisons is a terrible idea. </p>
<p>If upper-middle class and elite people can&rsquo;t seem to do this, what makes judges and lawmakers think hot-headed, impulsive criminals will be able to do this?</p>

		<p>I picked my brother up five months ago at a Huntsville prison after serving over 15yrs. He did this time at many Tex prisons and tells me the blacks will send someone over &#8220;this was at every prison&#8221; and you have the decision to fight or sometimes just letting him know you will fight is enough. Then the mexicans will send someone and then the whites as they have been watching.You can go solo if you can fight, the blacks have to many easy prey in weak whites to bother with you.  The white nationalist will let you know they have your back even if you don&rsquo;t join them when they know you will fight. Whites and Mexicans will fight together against blacks.Its the only chance they have because of being so out numbered.Weak whites only chance is with a white gang! </p>

A great deal of &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; gestures like this   &mdash;   indeed, almost all 21st C. &#8220;liberal&#8221; &#8220;thinking&#8221;   &mdash;   strike me as little more than wishful thinking. They&rsquo;re the results of people who insist the world be not as it is, but as they&rsquo;d LIKE it to be. </p>
<p>And this move in CA   &mdash;   to integrate the prisons of a huge, diverse and divided state   &mdash;   suffers from a higher level of wishful thinking and fantasy than most. How can the officials pusing this wrongheaded measure through actually expect it to WORK? Have the people who want to integrate prisons ever actually spent any time in a prison? </p>
<p>Presumably someone at some meeting or other as this was being put together, must have asked the question, &#8220;Won&rsquo;t the different races just start attacking each other? What do we do if that happens? Do we reverse the policy and resegregate? Or do we just keep the joint in total lockdown indefinitely, or&hellip; what?&#8221; </p>
<p>And if anyone DID ask such questions, what on earth was the satisfactory answer could POSSIBLY have been given that would allow the plan to proceed to completion?</p>
<p>Prison desegregation in California will not work. I&rsquo;ve never been arrested, but I know that in prison race is extremely important   &mdash;   and that much of prison life is in fact organized around race. So just from keeping my eyes and ears open (and reading AmRen!) I apparently know more about how things operate on the inside than do these starry-eyed legislators in Sacramento   &mdash;   who are soon to have blood on their gentle, loving, &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; hands. </p>

		<p>I can understand the desire to see people &#8220;All get along&#8221; as &#8220;We are all the same on the inside&#8221;. But is this missing something ? {Identity} Either we are going to make an orchestrated effort to destroy the different human subgroups that arrose naturally over time in seperate regions or social stratas or &#8220;Tolerate their diversity&#8221; As I see it the different groups are like different rythems or art forms or genetic languages. It is a sad aspect of history that these groups sometimes violated eachother but this probably happened no more frequently than self violations and infighting. A well educated proffesor(Psycho linguistics) once pointed out to me that (Assimilation) derives from the same word as (Assasination)&hellip; of the distinct Identity&rsquo;s. People need a certain amount of regularity within which to have a stable identity, many of the modern associative disorders and the crimes thereof are the product of too much identity change with too little time to integrate this in a functioning person. Its like taking all the art forms and saying they all have to blend because they are all art on the inside. Let people chose their own direction as long as they respect the basic rights af others, in prison or out&hellip;{Freedom of association} and {Tolerance of diversity} are not bad ideas.</p>
