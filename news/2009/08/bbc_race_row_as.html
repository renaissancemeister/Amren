			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Graham Smith, Daily Mail (London), August 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Asian Network has become embroiled in a race row after Sikh listeners accused the flagship digital radio station of being insensitive towards their religion.</p>
<p>The BBC was forced to remove a show from its website after Muslim presenter Adil Ray received threats from Sikhs who said he had denigrated one of their religious symbols.</p>
<p>Members of the Sikh community complained that Mr Ray had been disparaging about whether they really needed to carry kirpan daggers.</p>
<p>During the offending August 6 show, Mr Ray was discussing a Punjabi music concert in Canada where police had refused entry to Sikhs wearing kirpans.</p>
<p>But a number of listeners were upset that Mr Ray appeared to mock Sikhism, a charge that the Birmingham-based Asian Network denies.</p>
<p>The Sikh Media Monitoring Group has written to the BBC requesting a full transcript of the show.</p>
<p>The organisation has accused the Asian Network of being insensitive towards Sikh listeners.</p>
<p>&#8216;We should not be paying a licence fee for promoting the ignorance-based ramblings of those bent on self-promotion who sneer at Asian religion and culture,&rsquo; group spokesman Hardeep Singh told The Independent.</p>
<p>The Asian Network was set up eight years ago by the BBC&rsquo;s then director general Greg Dyke after he described the corporation as &#8216;hideously white&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The row has raised fresh questions about whether the radio station is adequately serving its Asian listeners.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the BBC Trust told the network that it needed to attract more listeners after its audience fell by nearly 20 per cent to 405,000 in a year.</p>
<p>In 2008 the Labour peer Lord Ahmed accused the station of being biased against Muslims in favour of Sikhs and Hindus. An internal investigation by the BBC later exonerated the network</p>
<p>A BBC spokesman today defended Mr Ray.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;Adil Ray did not make any judgement about people&rsquo;s faith or the rights and wrongs of wearing the kirpan.</p>
<p>&#8216;We welcome the fact that Adil has listeners of all faiths who enjoy his humour and presentation.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>The kirpan debate is getting a little humourous. In Sikhism, only the Khalsa (lit.: &#8220;pure&#8221;, a kind of warrior elite) are obliged to carry it (in order to always be able to protect the innocent).<br>
Nowadays, it usually takes the form of a small kind of letter opener wound into the turban.<br>
However, they are also obliged to wear turban, beard, a steel armband and short trousers. As the wannabee concert patrons very probably did not meet this, I see no grounds for a religious concealed carry.</p>

<p>No wonder the BNP is rising in popularity so fast with traitorious whites like this British worm.</p>
<p>Funny that even non-whites of different races and ethnicities hate each other, without even coming here to America to learn it from us white folk.  Wait - they must have learned it from the American programs received on their satellite dishes, like &#8220;Lavern and Shirley&#8221; and &#8220;SNL&#8221;&hellip;yeah, that&rsquo;s the ticket&hellip;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hideously white&#8221; and therefore selected for extermination.  If any phrase was ever a prodrome or an exposure of intention, this has to be one.</p>
