			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Kirkup and Tom Whitehead, Telegraph (London), August 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shahid Malik, the communities minister, said that the &#8220;Prevent&#8221; strategy is being reformed and partially renamed to avoid alienating British Muslims.</p>
<p>Prevent was launched in 2006 as part of the Government&rsquo;s four &#8220;Ps&#8221; anti-terror agenda  &mdash;  Prevent, Pursue, Protect and Prepare.</p>
<p>It aims to combat extremism by promoting &#8220;community cohesion&#8221; among all sections of society, but is widely seen as focusing predominantly on British Muslims.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard warned last month that such groups could be planning a terrorist &#8220;spectacular&#8221; to stoke up racial tensions amid the economic downturn.</p>
<p>The Met&rsquo;s counter-terrorism command has increased the number of officers in a special unit monitoring Right-wing extremists because of the threat.</p>
<p>Mr Malik said: &#8220;We are broadening our approach to involve all communities in developing shared values to strengthen cohesion.</p>
<p>&#8220;This includes putting a renewed focus on resisting right-wing, racist extremism, based on strengthening communities to help keep everyone safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Malik said that aspects of the Government&rsquo;s approach to extremism have alienated some British Muslims.</p>
<p>He told Sky News: &#8220;You speak to any Muslim on the street anywhere in this country and they will say they are as opposed as you and I are to extremism, to terrorism, but the frustration is that they are constantly linked with terrorism as a community as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on: &#8220;It is not just about the Muslim, it is actually about everybody in our society having a role to play and we cannot dismiss or underestimate the threat from the far right.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are white areas which are severely neglected. What we want to do is engage in those white communities to make sure that they are listened to, they feel they are respected, they are part of our community and in that sense they don&rsquo;t feel there is some unfairness in how government operates, in how public authorities operate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we want to do is to liberate and to empower Muslims, and people who live in white neighbourhoods as well, to stand up to extremist voices. They are in all communities; it is not just a problem of one religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2007, the Government launched &#8220;Preventing Violent Extremism,&#8221; an action plan for Muslim communities.</p>
<p>Mr Malik yesterday said that the title had offended some Muslims and would no longer be used.</p>
<p>&#8220;The label preventing violent extremism for the funding is said to be a problem because it&rsquo;s said to stigmatise and perhaps criminalise a whole community, in this case the Muslim community,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s not something we seek to do, that label has now disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Malik spoke after a think tank said that the Prevent strategy focuses too much on Islamic fanatics.</p>
<p>The Prevent strategy is alienating the Muslim community and should be widened to tackle all extremists, including the Far Right, according to the New Local Government Network. (NLGN)</p>
<p>Its report, Reassessing Prevent, highlights the recent election of two BNP representatives to the European Parliament as well as 55 local councillors around the country &#8220;underlines the fact that racial hatred and extremist ideology is not limited to any one faith or community&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anna Turley, author of the report, said: &#8220;While Islamist extremism remains a very serious threat to our security, this kind of extremism is not the only threat to the stability and security of our communities.&#8221;<br>

		<p>While Scotland Yard is chasing around imaginary white racist terrorist conspiracies, all those man-hours wasted could have been used to focus on the real ne&rsquo;er-do-wells.  After 9/11, officials high up in Gerhard Schroeder&rsquo;s government in Germany expressed regret that they had been spending all those years and all that time and money chasing around right wingers, when they disregarded the real threat.</p>

<p>Typical play on words. The statement is probably accurate. But tell us Mz Turley, what is the threat level of Britian&rsquo;s native white populace compared to the muslim threat level?</p>
<p>This nonsense reminds me of the little old white lady being pulled from the airport line to determine if she is a threat to the safety of an airflight, while young muslim males in the same line watch her being searched for a bomb. Yeah go ahead Britian. Concentrate on White &#8220;extremists&#8221; instead of muslim fanatics while your own Scotland Yard warns of a possibe terrorist &#8220;spectacular&#8221; in your near future. <br>

<p>Right wing extremism?   Is that meant to refer to the BNP?   Just what bombings, riots, beheadings, or death threats has Nick Griffin been engaged in, pray tell?</p>
<p><br>
 <b>&#8220;it is not just a problem of one religion.&rdquo; </b></p>
<p>Religion?  Nonsense!   They are making a huge mistake in supposing that this is solely a matter of religion.  Islam is not merely a religion in the usual sense thought of in the West. It is a comprehensive, monolithic, political and cultural movement   &mdash;    much more than just a religion   &mdash;    which is designed to achieve world conquest, and always has been since its inception.  It doesn&rsquo;t even make any denial of this fact. This is not some paranoid imagining.</p>

Could you imagine Japanese or Chinese having to struggle to be listened to in their own countries?  WE are the people who are unilaterally allowing our homelands to be peacefully colonized by people from other CONTINENTS, and we&rsquo;re the racists?  UNBELIEVABLE! </p>

<p>I would tend to disagree. The authorities have always been concerned foremost with white racism and activism. That&rsquo;s why 37,000 white women are raped ever year and blacks are up to hundreds of times more likely to commit real racial crime and yet the government and media are only obsessed with exposing &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo;, solely a white endeavor. Heck, the whole &#8216;terrorist threat&rsquo; could be just another avenue to stall white survivalists. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me any.  </p>

<p>Actually, the NLGN is a non-profit think-tank whose publications on the delivery of public services haven&rsquo;t shown extreme ideological bias until now.  </p>
<p>I suspect the driver&rsquo;s seat of this organization has been taken over in a coup by leftist zealots, probably from the Labour party.  The directorship has been held by Labour since 2005.</p>

		<p>When it comes to general racial insanity, there appears to be no insanity like British insanity! I feel for my anglo brothers and sisters across the pond. Although America and every other western nation nation are equally guilty of selling out their own people in the name of multiculturalism, diversity, etc.; no one seems to take it to the extreme&rsquo;s of racial self-immolation the way the Brits do. So sad&hellip;  </p>

		<p>At this point, unless something miraculous occurs, Britain is a lost cause.  Several decades of extremist liberal thought is all that it took to destroy what at one time was the greatest empire since Rome.  Within the next decade there will be open warfare on the streets of Great Britain, of this I have no doubt.</p>

		<p>The most significant, if not only, threat to the security of the British people is the Muslim community in the UK. Frankly there is no other threat on the radar.</p>
<p>The inclusion of imaginary terrorist threats from the &#8220;Far-Right&#8221; is just for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, they hope to conflate &#8220;Right&#8221; with terrorism and, <br>
secondly, they wish to use public funds to harrass and deny democratic representation to those who would follow the BNP.</p>
<p>The indiginous white people have beeen neglected, taken for granted and villified by the Labour Party for decades.</p>
<p>Now the white vote is slipping away as they now have the BNP alternative.</p>
<p>Labour is scared witless that the white working class will vote BNP.</p>
<p>This is not about terrorism - it&rsquo;s all about the destruction of legitimate democratic choice.</p>
<p>Vote BNP. Vote for freedom. Vote for your future and that of your children.</p>

		<p>On BBC radio recently it was stated that the annual funding for &#8216;Prevent&rsquo; was £45 million. This funding is not going to be increased, even though the scope of Prevent&rsquo;s action plan has broadened to include the indigenous white population.</p>
<p>(By &#8216;indigenous&rsquo;, I refer to those whose families had been resident in Britain for generations and before mass foreign immigration into Britain occurred. Notably, immigration has increased fivefold since 1997 when NuLabour came to power.).</p>
<p>Hence, we now have the present government&rsquo;s cynical use of funding formerly targetted at immigrants and their offspring being used to combat any voice of dissent from &#8216;racist&rsquo; and &#8216;uneducated&rsquo; Anglo-Saxon or Celtic citizens.<br>
On viewing this current strategy and also seeing the way that Britain is now slipping down in the league of  prosperous and respected countries, one can only wonder at the stupidity of NuLabour in the face of growing anger from its one-time supporters.</p>
<p>Very soon NuLabour will be out of power and probably will not be in government for decades.<br>
The main reason for this is that its actions and policies have not been those listed in its original manifesto. Also, the main role of any elected British government is the protection of its citizens - a responsibility that NuLabour has obviously abdicated. Merely labelling anyone who disagrees with NuLabour incompetence and deathwish dogma as being &#8216;white racist&rsquo; or &#8216;fascist&rsquo; is patently silly and should be regarded as such.</p>

		<p><i><b>Shahid Malik</b></i>, the Communities Minister,</p>
<p>Herein lies the problem!  In other words, the placing of a non-white Third Worlder and Muslim toboot in a position of power over everyone, in an ancestral white homeland.  Such blatant examples of conquest and colonisation will be outlawed in the future.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;There are white areas which are severely neglected. What we want to do is engage in those white communities to make sure that they are listened to, they feel they are respected, they are part of our community and in that sense they don&rsquo;t feel there is some unfairness in how government operates, in how public authorities operate.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Translation:  Since working-class whites in particular know full well they&rsquo;re being colonished and racially discriminated against in their own ancestral homelands, this could potentially ruin any change of us Muslims taking over the United Kingdom.  Therefore, we non-white Third World colonisers need to control whites in their TEMPORARY communities (which we&rsquo;ll be eventually taking over anyway), in their own ancestral homelands with a view to monitoring their political leanings and to be in a position to threaten them if need be with more oppression and racial discrimination if they dare display any tendencies of ethno-Nationalism and British National Party affiliations.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;What we want to do is to liberate and to empower Muslims, and people who live in white neighbourhoods as well, to stand up to extremist voices. They are in all communities; it is not just a problem of one religion.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Translation:  Us non-white Third World colonsers, more especially us Muslims, have to successfully hoodwink the pathetic white infidels into believing that our aim is to <i>liberate and empower</i> them to challenge extremists emanating, not from the Muslim or even black communities, but from the British National Party.  </p>
<p>The real liberating and empowering is reserved for our Muslim brothers only so as to enable them to use any means necessary, to convert the pathetic white infidels to Islam.<br>

  &mdash;   Resist<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>That word  &#8220;peacefully&#8221; is only a temporary condition, however. The situation is coming to the tipping point where the colonization process and white replacement will no longer be peaceful, and the authorities probably sense that.  That is what they are preparing against.</p>
<p>We have already seen many, many flare-ups here and there across Europe. But eventually one of them will become a conflagration that gets out of control and cannot be put out.  As whites see their ancient homelands being taken over by Third World riffraff and passing from their control, they are going to become much less &#8220;peaceful&#8221;  when they realize how they have been betrayed by their treasonous political class. </p>
<p>That class would do well to be worried! They have run up an enormous bill that is inevitably coming due.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The label preventing violent extremism for the funding is said to be a problem because it&rsquo;s said to stigmatise and perhaps criminalise a whole community, in this case the Muslim community,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not something we seek to do, that label has now disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem nor offensive to an entire particular segment of the population (who remained unnamed, by the way, contextually) UNLESS that entire segment of the population advocated violent extremism and assumed the neutral phrase specifically was about them.  Would it?  Ergo, all muslims are prepared to either engage in, or secretly support, violent extremism as simply one tool in their belt - the goal - making the world muslim by any means.</p>
