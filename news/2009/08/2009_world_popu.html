<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>2009 World Population Data SheetGlobal population numbers are on track to reach 7 billion in 2011, just 12 years after reaching 6 billion in 1999. Virtually all of the growth is in developing countries. And the growth of the world&rsquo;s youth population (ages 15 to 24) is shifting into the poorest of those countries.</p>
<p>The Population Reference Bureau&rsquo;s 2009 World Population Data Sheet and its summary report, to be released on Aug. 12, offer detailed information about country, regional, and global population patterns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The great bulk of today&rsquo;s 1.2 billion youth  &mdash;  nearly 90 percent  &mdash;  are in developing countries,&#8221; said Carl Haub, PRB senior demographer and co-author of the data sheet. Eight in 10 of those youth live in Africa and Asia. &#8220;During the next few decades, these young people will most likely continue the current trend of moving from rural areas to cities in search of education and training opportunities, gainful employment, and adequate health care.&#8221; One of the major social questions of the next few decades is whether their expectations will be met.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m only 44 years old now and I hope I am taken by an unforeseen illness or accident before the world is transformed into a global socialist empire.  Huge population growth among young people in so called &#8220;developing nations&#8221; can only mean more unrest and cries for global bail-outs and global socialism.  I can see that in the near future anyone who is intelligent enough to care for themselves and family will be judged a racist and striped of everything he owns.</p>

European Americans will come to realize their tenuous position at the top of the world order. When you speak about 20th Century man or 20th century modern world you are referring to Europeans in North America.  For those Americans who feel the world is all one &#8220;village&#8221; there will be a great awakening as the security of the United States dissolves into a quagmire resembling present day South Africa or Zimbabwe.</p>

		<p>Quality, not quantity counts. Let em breed. More disease, unemployment, no education, no high tech knowhow. Awful for the women in these countries: rape and AIDS are what the teeming male masses offer. but as to the balance of power? NADA. Just don&rsquo;t wast foreign aid on this garbage.</p>

		<p>Obviously, serious intervention must be taken to prevent the growth of third world populations and their antecedents in the Industrialized nations.  There will be no Industrialized world by 1050 otherwise.  These measures must include, education, birth control, voluntary and forced contraception/sterilization and abortion.  </p>

		<p>A very bad omen for the White race!  This should be held up as the REASON why Whites need to have their own nations! If the numbers and the races were reversed you can bet the UN Human Rights Commission would declare a genocide watch and make sure that these nonwhite races were protected to reproduce and have their own lands to do so. </p>

		<p>Birthrates are plummeting all around the globe, except for one place: black sub-Sahara Africa, the population for which is exploding, completely dependent upon white man&rsquo;s mass food and medical aid, which has made this all possible. Birth rates in sub-Sahara black africa is nearly 7 children per female. No effort at family planning or responsibility at all. They will continue to flood out into Europe and America at an exponentially increasing rate. Whites will be made to take on ever more of the burden of this unfettered irresponible and environmentally devastating black African reproduction rate.<br>
Have you noticed how many young white couples have forgone having their own children and adopted black children, many from Africa, instead? Whites make all the scrifices and take all the responsibility. But eventually they will be overwhelmed.</p>

This SHOULD&rsquo;VE read - moving from rural areas to WHITE cities and countries in search of easy victims and free-bees!!!! Seriously, do you REALLY think that they&rsquo;re going to get education, training opportunities, gainful employment, and adequate health care in their 3rd world hell-holes, especially UGANDA!!!   </p>

		<p>With the downfall of Western Civilization and no one left to carry the White man&rsquo;s burden; most of the third world populations will starve well before they can reach these kinds of numbers. I think the world has reached it&rsquo;s pinnacle in advancement in all fields and peak population in the world will most likely be reached in the next 20 years. </p>

<p><b>EU Prepares Path to Flood Europe with Millions of Third Worlders</b></p>
<p>The European Union will on Wednesday this coming week formally launch its plans to flood all of Europe with millions of Third World immigrants in terms of a new &ldquo;joint EU resettlement programme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan, to be announced by the European Commission, has as a first phase, the &ldquo;resettlement programme&rdquo; under which nations would take in &ldquo;more refugees from poor and war-hit third countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next phase will be to &ldquo;coordinate Europe&rsquo;s response&rdquo; to the tsunami of invaders from Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The rationale for the latest EU treason is, it says, to &ldquo;ease the pressure on countries such as Malta, Italy and Spain&rdquo; and to spread the load amongst other states who &ldquo;are not sharing enough of the burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plans to harmonise asylum and family reunion criteria throughout Europe will be published in October.</p>
<p>Under the plans, a new body, the European Asylum Support Office, will annually identify priority groups which need refuge, for example Iraqi refugees in Syria or Jordan, Somali refugees in Kenya or Sudanese refugees from Chad.</p>
<p>Then EU nations agreeing to take such asylum-seekers would receive help from an enlarged European Refugee Fund  &mdash;  funded, of course, by the taxpayers who will be paying for their own demographic swamping.</p>

<p>I think you are right.  The population curve has rocketed upwards like a stock market bubble and has to come back to earth.  Much of this will be through falling birth rates, but not in Africa.  By feeding Africa we have achieved two things: 1) destroying their local farming economy and 2) allowing the population to increase far in excess of what that economy could have supported, even before the food aid.  In other words, we have expertly set them up for the greatest famine in human history.  At this point it looks like only a matter of time.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s not &#8216;inevitable&rsquo; like some force of nature such as an eathquake or volcano, they will come purely and simply because of the lick-spittle &#8216;liberal&rsquo; politicians that afflict our societies.<br>

		<p>Why is this never discussed among Whites? Consider only 2% are of child bearing age and another 6% who are not and are getting older and dying off. How much does that leave us? Even that 2% of child bearing age are having bi-racial children or none at all. We are in DIRE straits folks. Tell everyone you know about our low numbers and see if they even have a clue or if they even care. </p>

		<p>I have to aqgree with poster #3  &mdash;  Does it really matter if the planet if flooded with non-whites? Whites are a global minority anyway. It is quality, not quantity. The only way it can affect us is by letting them into our countries. Maybe there are 5 million Africans living in mudhuts, maybe there are 15 million. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What does matter is white solidarity and strength. White racial awareness is the important thing, not numbers. Once upon a time, American Indians outnumbered Whites in America, and look how that turned out.</p>

		<p>Actually, this bald &#8216;90%&rsquo; of today&rsquo;s youth in &#8216;developing&rsquo; (ie non-White) countries is far worse than it seems firsthand.<br>
Consider that populous nations such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan etc are included in the &#8216;developed&rsquo; total.<br>
Consider also that a near majority of the USA&rsquo;s youth are non-White (the USA being the most populous develpoed nation),consider also the big non-White youth cohort in France, Britain and other major west European nations.<br>
Consider Canadian demographics.<br>
