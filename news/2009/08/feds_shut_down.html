<h1><a href="https://www.pittsburghpostgazette.com/pg/09227/991047-28.stm">Feds Shut Down Hill District S&L;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Grant, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, August 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The federal Office of Thrift Supervision shut down Dwelling House Savings and Loan yesterday after reporting that the minority-owned bank located in the Hill District &#8220;was in an unsafe and unsound condition, was critically undercapitalized and had no reasonable prospect of recovering.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are disappointed at this closing on behalf of Pittsburgh, but especially for the Hill District and other predominately African-American communities in the city where Dwelling House has played such a significant role,&#8221; said Doug Root, a spokesman for the Heinz Endowments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dwelling House was the lender of first and last resort for two generations of black families in the Pittsburgh community, but it suffered a severe blow to its stability late last year when federal auditors discovered that about $3 million had been drained out of its capital account and the bank was actually operating with $500,000 in negative equity. Bank officers blamed the heavy losses on the work of a ring of cyber thieves. Pittsburgh police and FBI agents are investigating the case, but no charges have been filed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The OTS fined five directors of Dwelling House over the last two weeks for failing to take steps to protect the minority-owned institution even after they had been warned five years ago of its vulnerable predicament.</p>
<p>Former Dwelling House president and CEO Robert M. Lavelle, who was fired in November by order of the OTS, also was fined $5,000 last week for his role in the gross negligence that ultimately brought down the bank.</p>
<p>Board members Barry Balliet, Everett Blanton, David Lendt, Johnnie Monroe and Robert Thornton were fined $1,000 each for multiple violations of a 2006 OTS order that required the institution to adopt money laundering preventions.</p>
<p>The institution has been the focus of scrutiny by federal regulators for at least five years. Regulators were concerned about Dwelling House&rsquo;s role in providing banking services to prison inmates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ultimately, federal authorities restricted the bank from opening new prisoner accounts and restricted all existing accounts to $25 maximum deposits. Regulators prohibited any more electronic transactions involving prison inmates, and also required Dwelling House three years ago to submit to a mentoring arrangement with executives at Dollar Bank.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1984, there were 79 thrifts in the country classified as minority owned, which includes African-American as well as Hispanic- and Asian-owned thrifts. With the failure of Dwelling House, today there are only 20 left, including only 11 African-American thrifts.</p>

		<p>And they wonder why blacks don&rsquo;t use black banks.  Part of the reason, aside from what I said on AR&rsquo;s story yesterday, is what we find out here   &mdash;   black o&o; banks are poorly run.</p>
