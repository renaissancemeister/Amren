<h1>Racist? She Prefers Dating White Guys</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carolyn Hax, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), August 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><b>Dear Carolyn: </b>Some friends of mine had been talking up this guy they thought would be perfect for me, so I finally went on a blind date with him. It turns out he&rsquo;s black, and while I am <em>not</em> racist and have no problem with interracial dating in general, it&rsquo;s not for me. I just prefer to date white guys.</p>
<p>I told my friends why I wouldn&rsquo;t be seeing him again, and they were, shockingly, horrified. Did I miss something here? I know interracial dating is more prevalent now than it used to be, but I didn&rsquo;t realize it was so common that you get in trouble if you don&rsquo;t want to do it. {snip}</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO</p>
<p><b>Carolyn says: </b>You&rsquo;re right  &mdash;  no one should have to date anyone s/he doesn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>And your friends are right, too  &mdash;  they shouldn&rsquo;t have to pretend they&rsquo;re not horrified by something they find morally repugnant.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, interracial dating is more prevalent now, but its prevalence here is the cart; the issue here is the horse.</p>
<p>More people date interracially because more people realize that the only alternative to being racist is to judge each person as a person.</p>
<p>Your decision not to date this man wasn&rsquo;t about his character or lack thereof, it wasn&rsquo;t about his sex appeal or lack thereof, {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However: We&rsquo;re having this conversation because you didn&rsquo;t find his race attractive. That&rsquo;s what racism is.<br>

<p>Sorry, Carolyn, it&rsquo;s perfecty acceptable to reject dating partners because of race. In fact, whites should do that.  And,they should separate from non-whites.  Yes,you can reject  whole races, one doesn&rsquo;t have to look at character, etc. It has to do, ultimately, with the survival of white people.  </p>
<p>So, Carolyn, why don&rsquo;t you read up a little on genetics before you try to wipe out white family lines.  </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re concerned with &#8220;racism&#8221; Carolyn? Grow up, you&rsquo;re preaching genocide.</p>

		<p>Dear Ms. Anon in Sacramento-</p>
<p>Assuming that you really exist at all,and are not a figment of the imagination of some lunatic who managed to get access to a computer with an internet connection,guess what? You either already are a racist or are well on the way to becoming one.</p>
<p>Swallow your tears,and listen. Being a racist is a GOOD thing,regardless of the opinions of your friends,and regardless of the idiot opinion of a goofball social arbiter. Being a racist is good for a number of reasons,some of which I will now proceed to point out to you.</p>
<p>1) Being a racist,and not wishing to date black men is a good thing,because it means that you are dramatically lowering your chances of being raped,murdered,beaten,abandoned,or some combination thereof. Black men,of all the demographics in this country-are probably the worst source of life partners available.</p>
<p>And even if the black man you&rsquo;re dating is a decent enough fellow,he will almost certainly have friends,relatives,and acquaintances that most assuredly are NOT decent fellows,and when this decent man becomes part of your life,you will also be exposed to those not-decent men,like it or not.</p>
<p>2)Being a racist is a good thing,because it means that your children will look like you,and more importantly,be as smart as you. The average IQ for blacks in this country is significantly lower than the average IQ for the other races,and this means that were you to have children with this man,your children would almost certainly not be as intelligent as you. And not just one of the kids,either. All families with more than one kid go through this-they&rsquo;ll have a smart kid,and then they&rsquo;ll have the kid who tries but can&rsquo;t quite ever be as sharp as the smart kid,and then maybe there&rsquo;ll be a third who has other strengths,and weaknesses.</p>
<p>But were you to have your kids with this black guy,here&rsquo;s what you would look at every day at the breakfast table: a bunch of kids who-no matter how they try-will never be able to be as smart as you. This will eventually break your heart.</p>
<p>3)Lots more reasons are out there-but those are the two that come to mind,and which are the most important. Continue being a racist,and you&rsquo;ll live a longer,happier life. As will your children.</p>

		<p>And the moral to this story is? For Ms. Hax (how true) it is the evil of the letter writer&rsquo;s racism. For us it should be: don&rsquo;t deny being racist or apologize for it. Rather, become informed and debate your beliefs on their merits. The anti-racists have no case, as Asian success proves, and we can win by on the evidence.</p>

		<p>So racism is defined as finding members of a certain race attractive.</p>
<p>I guess that makes me a racist as well.  In general, I don&rsquo;t find black women attractive.  Apparently black men find white women more attractive than black women also. So they must racist as well.</p>

		<p>Typical of white liberals and blacks, apparently whites are racist for only wanting to be around whites, yet these same hypocrites have no problem only dating within their race.  I&rsquo;m sick of this double standard with white liberals and these black guys that guilt trip white girls into sleeping with them.</p>

		<p>Blacks might call her a racist, I&rsquo;d call her a decent human being! To me, the lowest kind of whore is a White woman who does have sex with Blacks. But there&rsquo;s no accounting for [lack of] taste, apparently.</p>
<p>Our children were taught from childhood. You can be friends with, but you do not, repeat, you do not marry or have sex with Blacks. The price would be that you&rsquo;d be forever barred from your family after that. You&rsquo;d be disowned and disinherited. PERIOD!</p>

		<p>Dear Abby, Ann Landers, or Carolyn Hax, sob sisters are anti-White leftists.  They couldn&rsquo;t get their jobs if they didn&rsquo;t spout the liberal line of the day.  The Left tries to cover every base, and their not about to let millions of women get good advice if it interferes with the Red agenda.  If even the sportswriters have to follow the party line, no media employee can escape thought control.  </p>

		<p>Prejudice:A prejudice is a preconceived belief, opinion or judgment especially toward a group of people characterized by their race, social class, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age or religion.</p>
<p>Preference: (also called &#8220;taste&#8221; or &#8220;penchant&#8221;) is a concept, used in the social sciences, particularly economics. It assumes a real or imagined &#8220;choice&#8221; between alternatives and the possibility of rank ordering of these alternatives, based on happiness, satisfaction, gratification, enjoyment, utility they provide. More generally, it can be seen as a source of motivation. In cognitive sciences, individual preferences enable choice of objectives/goals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve succeeded in mixing up the words in people&rsquo;s minds. It is the right of everyone to choose who they wish to be with not the governments. Don&rsquo;t be fooled. Wake up my friends.</p>

<p>Why would white people want to adhere to &#8220;the only alternative to being racist&#8221; for any reason and in particular by endangering and debasing themselves?  There is absolutely nothing whatsoever wrong with being &#8220;racist&#8221; since being &#8220;racist&#8221; simply confirms that one&rsquo;s survival instincts are in working order&hellip; <br>

<p>&gt; So every white female who is approached must date a black.  The real truth in this &#8220;New Miss Manners&#8221; article is that the female SACRAMENTO is right to select by reason, a decision to not date a black man.  Aside from the increased personal safety issues, she might not like black culture.  She might not want to have to listen to rap music, or talk about the black president, civil rights issues, (from the black perspective) or have to deal with the predictable sexual agressiveness of black males.</p>
<p>Ultimately, SACRAMENTO will have to be comfortable - as we all must with being racists.  That is because racism is the only way that whites can survive at all.  Besides, all the other races are by practices and politics, racist.</p>
<p>But one date with the guy probably made her a RACE REALIST.</p>

<p>So pontificates Comrade Carolyn Hax, stupid and sanctimonious multi-cultist whore that she is!</p>
<p>How dare this wretched Red viper condemn this woman who honestly admits that while she has no problem with interracial dating, she prefers &ldquo;to date white guys.&rdquo; That is what she is comfortable with and wants to possibly marry. What is wrong with that? The woman who wrote the letter to Comrade Carolyn, may also not like short men as a group or those with excessive body hair. Does this make her guilty of heightism or fuzzism? I don&rsquo;t even think someone as permeated with orthodox miscegenation obsessions as Comrade Carolyn, could promote such ideas; however, she has no problem with invoking the perverse chant of &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; when chastising this woman for not being a treasonous race-mixing harlot.  </p>
<p>As always, God help all!<br>

<p>In my days as a leftist when I read Lenin and Trotsky and thought that miscegenation was a fantastic and  revolutionary force which could be used as a hammer to smash the oppressive white capitalist order, even THEN I could not muster even the slightest stirrings of sexual desire for the African Sistas. </p>
<p>IT is just not hard wired in the physiology in the genetic make up of most normal whites, and there is no way in ten million years I could be convinced otherwise.</p>

		<p>Racism is many things.  <br>
Any White who feels a sense of racial identity is a racist.<br>
Any White woman who doesn&rsquo;t want to date a Black man is a racist.<br>
Any White who wants to live with Whites is a racist.<br>
Any White who doesn&rsquo;t take the side of a Black in any dispute between a Black and a White is a racist.<br>
Any White who presents a logical argument for the support of their own race is a racist.<br>
Any White who points out the much higher crime statistics of Blacks is a racist.<br>
Any White that supports closing the borders to illegal aliens is a racist.</p>

		<p>This is hilarious.  I don&rsquo;t find aborigine people attractive at all, but I&rsquo;m a racist since I didn&rsquo;t try to find one fit to have a family with?  I can&rsquo;t imagine being &#8220;guilted&#8221; into forming a relationship with ANYONE but to have someone call me a racist over it is disgusting.  Also, it sounds like she barely knows her &#8220;friends&#8221; at all since they obviously set this up intentionally to prove a point.  I feel sorry for white girls with idiot friends like this.

		<p>Consider:</p>
<p>- Statistically, black males are more likely to carry STDs like HIV and Herpes, which indicates black men&rsquo;s irresponsible attitudes towards sexual safety and promiscuity.<br>
- 68% of black women, whose fathers are virtually all black, give birth to children out of wedlock, which indicates black men&rsquo;s unwillingness to commit.<br>
- 1 out of 3 black men will spend some time in prison, which indicates that black men are dangerous.</p>
<p>Sexually promiscuous, sexually irresponsible, unwilling to commit and dangerous - doesn&rsquo;t sound like a good potential mate. Indeed, it would be wise to avoid such individuals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing racist about wanting to avoid a group which, as statistics prove, do not make good partners.</p>

		<p>I am a White man and I would NEVER date outside my race out of both principle and aesthetic. Needless to say, I would never go on a &#8220;blind date&#8221; or meet with someone from an internet dating site because of their deceptive and disturbingly distant basis of human interaction.</p>
<p>Now the media doesn&rsquo;t even TRY to cloak its bias against Whites anymore. To preserve the White race is to preserve White culture and everything it encompasses, including our biological distinction as White people. The fact that the subject mentions her friends&rsquo; reactions as &#8220;horrified&#8221; horrifies ME. Minor indignation, sure, that&rsquo;s understandable but to be &#8220;horrified&#8221;? Come on, that sort of extreme attitude is the very reason I as a White separatist feel so threatened.</p>
<p>And if that makes me a racist, then I am a racist. I am a racist, and that&rsquo;s that.</p>

		<p>This woman didn&rsquo;t want to date a black man .That is her right and she doesn&rsquo;t have to explain anything.Her preference is to date white men,she made a free choice.If she went to the store and decided she wanted to pick Tide over Cheer that is a preference.White women shouldn&rsquo;t be shamed into dating someone they don&rsquo;t want to date.Everyone has biases toward all things.Is it racism if you pick Tide to clean your clothes instead of Cheer?This is a form of social conditioning to make the white women feel guity for not dating the black men.</p>

The thing that we need to remember is that when money is involved, leaders of businesses acknowledge the importance of race when they wouldn&rsquo;t elsewhere.  Just as the fashion industry turns away African American models to stay in business, the dating industry takes a customer&rsquo;s race preferences very seriously.</p>
<p>All the dating services out there (whether they are online or one on one), always ask the customer what their racial preference is.  The matchmaking provider always takes this preference seriously and doesn&rsquo;t make the customer feel ashamed about it in any way.  </p>
<p>The matchmakers and dating services out there wouldn&rsquo;t be acting this way if most people didn&rsquo;t take this one characteristic of their potential match seriously.  And if they want to stay in business they can&rsquo;t mess around with this politically correct garbage as this newspaper columnist is here in this article.</p>
<p>Before closing I will also add that far too often I see pessimistic posts of all kinds from far too many people on this website.  The people on here who are pessimistic about the future of the white race obviously aren&rsquo;t thinking things through too clearly.  </p>
<p>After looking around, doing research etc&hellip; it should be quite obvious to everyone on here that it is mostly our media who proposes anti-white propaganda, and it should also be obvious that the media doesn&rsquo;t reflect the true feelings of most white people.  </p>
<p>The way this liberal newspaper columnist in this article here acts directly opposite of how the popular matchmaking service providers act, is a fine example of what I am conveying here, and what everybody on this website should be figuring out on their own. </p>
<p>Start having more confidence in your race.  Your pessimism isn&rsquo;t doing the rest of us any good, and you are insulting your own race while you are at it.</p>

		<p>Surprisingly, some of the reader comments are spot on:</p>
<p>&#8220;Used to be called racist for the same reason&hellip;</p>
<p>Until I pointed out that it is acceptable for any other race/religion to date within their race/religion. Why is it a problem if a caucasian wishes to do the same?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ultimate purpose of dating is to make a connection and get into a relationship, get married and eventually have children. To say people of European descent (or any other people on Earth) shouldn&rsquo;t have the right to date their own ethnic group, is akin to saying they don&rsquo;t have the right to have their own children. It is akin to telling a Japanese woman that she must date me. If she would prefer to have an Asian son or daughter, she&rsquo;s a bad terrible person. I can&rsquo;t imagine a greater infringement upon the basic Human rights of a group of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To prefer to date people of your own race. All ethnicities have this tendency.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The young lady could have described her preference for white men as a &#8220;fetish&#8221;  &mdash;  then (in SF Bay where I live, at least) her friends&rsquo; belief in the goodness of all things odd and unnatural would have obligated them to find her &#8220;fetish&#8221; acceptable.</p>
<p>That gives me an idea for my mainstream media postings. Next time some &#8220;anti-racist,&#8221; about to pop with the fullness of their own virtue, goes on a rant, I&rsquo;ll respond that their concern obviously goes beyond &#8220;justice and equality, blah blah blah,&#8221; and that they seem to have a positive &#8220;fetish&#8221; for black people.</p>
<p>If my post isn&rsquo;t removed, the response should be satisfyingly pyrotechnic.</p>
<p>To which I can then respond that fetishes serve persons who are unable to find satisfaction in normal behavior, and pairing up with persons of one&rsquo;s own race (and being more or less indifferent in all respects to other races) has been normal behavior for a few hundred thousand years or so. </p>
<p>So all this hoop-dee-doo today about other races is a contemporary mass fetish.</p>

		<p>Go to almost any internet dating site and you&rsquo;ll find that most of the white women specify that they want a white man (or sometimes a white or Asian man).  So I guess they&rsquo;re all just wicked racists. </p>
<p>So racism is now simply not finding another race to be attractive.  It&rsquo;s amazing how expansive the definition of &#8220;racism&#8221; has gotten.  Well, I&rsquo;m a racist too because while I&rsquo;ve seen attractive Asian women as well as attractive white women I&rsquo;ve seen very few attractive black women.  (The only black women who are at all attractive to me are light skinned and have strongly Caucasian features   &mdash;   so why not just go for the real thing?)</p>

		<p>  I do not see the problem with what the women stated. She prefers whits guys and that is okay. Spike Lee has stated that he does not find white women attractive and would not date one. I do not think the woman is a racist she just prefers white guys and I don&rsquo;t think Lee is a racist because he prefers black women. The whole issue is just a matter of personal taste. There are many white women that find black men attactive, thereby discriminating against all other types of men. Again I do not see a problem with that situation. People want what people want just deal with it.</p>

I see nothing in the lady&rsquo;s letter saying she found the black date of good character or sexy.  The fact that she finds blacks unappealing has nothing to do with &#8220;racism&#8221; and everything to do with her freedom of choice, which is sacrosanct to feminists as long as it&rsquo;s exercised to abort babies, choose a career outside the home, etc.  Apparently white women have no freedom any more not to choose black mates.

		<p>We need an advice columnist for whites like Ann Landers or Dear Abby. We need some guidance for everyday situations where race is a factor. Something might be fitted into the AmRen newsletter, the CofCC Observer, or else on one of the white websites. Some humour like Miss Manners might make it fun too.</p>
<p>I had an awkward situation happen this weekend. One of our new neighbors felt our street would benefit from having a BBQ and block get-together. Invitations were given to every house as well as several people in his Christian church. Our street is rapidly diversifying and I know his church is racially mixed. I expected to be at a gathering of mostly non-whites and that&rsquo;s what happened. It was fun and I was friendly to everyone there but I also felt awkward because I believe in the AmRen philsophy. Usually at social occasions I like to talk to people about white plight but that couldn&rsquo;t be done here. I&rsquo;m sure most AmRenners and whites find ourselves mingling among non-whites almost daily. Having a white identity makes free and open socializing impossible if not difficult. It&rsquo;s awkward socializing with non-whites if you believe that as a demographic they are harming my way of life. </p>

But no&hellip; goofballs like Carolyn and the girl&rsquo;s friends (who&rsquo;d I&rsquo;d quickly ditch and move on to smarter friends), insist that wanting to be paired with someone who is like her (which is Anglo-Saxon) is appalling.</p>
<p>Oh, go stick your head in a bucket, Carolyn &amp; Friends. You know what racism is? A racial prejudice or discrimination. You know what prejudice is? An adverse opinion or leaning formed without just grounds or before sufficient knowledge or b: an instance of such judgment or opinion c : an irrational attitude of hostility directed against an individual, a group, a race, or their supposed characteristics. (From the Merriam-Webster Dictionary)</p>
<p>The girl didn&rsquo;t find the idea of kissing a Black man appealing. So freakin&rsquo; what? Who cares? It happens. It isn&rsquo;t racism, it&rsquo;s a preference. </p>
<p>From Carolyn&rsquo;s advice, it sounds like she and this woman&rsquo;s friends thought she should have dated him for a certain period of time before saying he wasn&rsquo;t for her. For the love of pete&hellip;</p>

		<p>Well, I can do her one better.  Not only would I not date outside of my race, I wouldn&rsquo;t date anyone of my race who would date outside of our race.  Mixed-race marriages end in divorce more often than same-race marriages, and thus, it is an element of compatibility.  I&rsquo;ve seen these online dating commercials, and they claim to use a certain number of dimensions of compatibility in matching people.  However, they must not be using race because they have been showing more mixed couples on the commercial.  How could they not use a dimension that when not matched, causes a significant increase in the divorce percentage?  They&rsquo;re doing a disservice.</p>

<p>Not finding a man attractive because of his race simply doesn&rsquo;t fit the definition of racism.  But that&rsquo;s no reason why a liberal columnist cannot use the smear to induce guilt in the Star-Tribune&rsquo;s ever-dwindling readership.</p>

<p>LOL!  That&rsquo;s what racism is, eh?  So funny.</p>
<p>She probably thinks 99% of all blacks are unattractive, which will translate to her version of the definition of racism, but because her work requires a different opinion and attitude she&rsquo;s prostituting herself by saying things that she doesn&rsquo;t believe, just for the sake of money.</p>
<p>I wonder what she&rsquo;s going to do when her newspaper folds, as it is expected to do?  </p>

		<p><i> More people date interracially because more people realize that the only alternative to being racist is to judge each person as a person.</i></p>
<p>Wow! Amazing! This columnist has a perfect and complete understanding of the exact definition of &#8220;racist.&#8221; Everyone I hear from has a different definition of racism, and yet, this woman casts them all aside and insists that her definition is the only true and correct one.</p>
<p>Still, it does cause problems. What of those who insist that only whites can be &#8220;racist,&#8221; because only they are members of the &#8220;power structure&#8221; in this country, while blacks are not? It seems by the good columnist&rsquo;s definition, blacks can be racist too! By putting forth an overly simplistic definition of &#8220;racism,&#8221; it seems this columnist is revealing herself as a racist as well! </p>
<p>Also, one wonders the race of the person she is married to, hmmmmm? If he&rsquo;s white, can she prove that his race played no role in her decision? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding a lot of racism here, and I&rsquo;m horrified by such morally repugnant behavior!</p>

		<p>Lovely, the author&rsquo;s too stupid to know she&rsquo;s shooting herself in the foot (this is common amongst leftist radicals); the more they make normal, healthy behavior &#8220;racist,&#8221; the more &#8220;racism&#8221; becomes normal and healthy.</p>
<p>But this sort of thing is built into leftism and absolutely inevitable.  There is no limit on leftism short of the achievement of its goal: the destruction of western civilization and European man.  Get this &#8220;no limits&#8221; thing through your heads if you want to understand leftism, folks.  Each baby step simply leads to the next; &#8220;enough&#8221; is a racist concept until the goal is accomplished and western civilization and European man are erased from existence and memory (make no mistake, if they win they&rsquo;ll scrub the history books&hellip;probably just before they use them for kindling).</p>

		<p>Having offspring who look nothing like you or your parents or grand parents surely is worse than being considered a &#8216;racist.&rsquo;<br>
It&rsquo;s akin to self genocide.</p>

<p>I know of a very dark skinned Indian programmer here in Oz who is a &#8216;friend of a friend&rsquo; (he shows nothing but hostility towards me, though I keep my political/racial views completely to myself&hellip;.I put it down to Phenotype jealousy.)<br>
Well he has recently had a baby with a Celtic looking, American born/raised, strawberry blonde (I kid you not) and their child is so dark and completely has his bone structure and eyes.<br>
In the genetic lottery I&rsquo;m sure he was hoping for more of a flattering mix, but it didn&rsquo;t eventuate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the photos of their wedding that took place in India and you can see the strained smiles on her older female relatives faces (no males relatives made the trip),I suppose environment could have been a factor.<br>
But what I don&rsquo;t get perhaps because I&rsquo;m a male, or heartless or something, is how you can raise a child who looks nothing like you? <br>
If my partner and I were infertile and we had to adopt, I guess you do what you have to, and I&rsquo;ve been on both sides of the step parent situation and it&rsquo;s safe to say that it&rsquo;s not an easy situation.</p>
<p>But to knowingly &#8216;breed out&rsquo; your ancestors and replace them with someone who looks like they come from the Middle East or Puerto Rico, I just do not understand.<br>
I have boundless love for my children, but not that other sort of &#8220;I can love anything&#8221; love.</p>

		<p>Whom a woman wants to date is an intimate intensely personal matter and is no one else&rsquo;s business to judge: If you only want to date someone of a certain religion, or ethnic group, or race, that is only your damn business. No one would think to condemn someone because she doesn&rsquo;t want to date someone who&rsquo;s fat or bald or ugly. Or not attractive to her, whether physically or personality or culture, that is just personal taste. Just like if you like certain foods and not other foods. It is an outrage this p.c. group-think effort to put a woman on some kind of guilt trip just because she has personal preferences for whom she wishes to associate with.<br>
There are black women who won&rsquo;t date non-blacks, and they are not condemned. Only women of light who don&rsquo;t submit to the advances of a black male. Like they are supposed to be the personal property of any black male who approaches them. Where are the feminists here? The women&rsquo;s rights folks? The woman&rsquo;s right to choose? Without being judged or condemned?<br>

She has told me point blank that she believes people should stick to their own kind meaning blacks with blacks, whites with whites and so on. She is not prejudiced, neither am I, and we get along great. I told her I feel the same and she is cool with that. The point is that we can freely and unashamedly admit in the open what most people feel inside but are afraid to voice out loud for fear of shocking and horrifying their friends. Her preference in men that she wants to date probably includes other factors such as height, weight, intelligence level, etc&hellip;&hellip; When are people going grow up and stop trying to be accepted on the basis of their skin color? How shallow minded is that? Her friends are wrong and if they were truly her friends they would have known her preferences to begin with. </p>

		<p>I attended my sister&rsquo;s son (my nephew&rsquo;s) wedding a few weeks ago in Pennsylvania. Andrew (my nephew)married a Black woman. Her name is Angela. He is 29. She is 26. The young lady seems to be decent enough. She is very attractive and sophisticated. Her mother is a doctor and her father is an engineer. She has two older sisters, one who works in television and another who is a lobbysit in Washington. She is beginning her final year of law school at U Penn. My sister and her husband like her quite a bit.<br>
Andrew is corporate attorney. My sister is a college vice provost at an upscale liberal arts college.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I am very dissappointed that Andrew would do this. He is a very handsome, fit, intelligent, successful young man with two ivy league degrees (Dartmouth 02&rsquo; Yale Law school 05&rsquo;) and who could have married a number of beautiful, successful White women. It almost breaks my heart. This seens to be more and more common these days.<br>

		<p>      Set up a conditioned fear response to a sound, or in the case of humans, a word. Then change or add on to the meaning of the word-which the person never really understood to begin with.<br>
Very clever. With animals, you&rsquo;d have to associate a new sound with the original so the fear response would &#8220;rub off&#8221; on the second sound. But since people are supposedly rational, you just have to play with the word; expand the meaning to make people even more afraid; more in doubt of themselves and in confusion about what is right. Our only salvation is to awaken from the tyranny of the word. As St Paul said, &#8220;The Spirit saves, but the letter killeth.&#8221; In this example, the spirtit is the real meaning of the word not the ad hoc corruption of it.</p>

<p>But to find someone of a different race unattractive is racist? Thats tantamount to saying you have no right to feel that and therefore you must have sex with them anyway.</p>
<p>How stupid. If he was 25 stone would that be sizeist? Or had bad teeth - toothist?</p>
<p>We find attractive that which appeals to us.</p>
<p>Personally I dont find black women attractive - why would I want to go out with a person who has no sexual or physical attraction to me?</p>

<p>I wish I could wake up tomorrow morning and the word would be magically erased from everyone&rsquo;s memory  &mdash;  I could walk around speaking to people with sentences that had the word &#8220;racism&#8221; in them, and everyone would look at me like,  &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>(In other words, return to the days of my youth, before this stinkin&rsquo; word was even known).</p>
<p>Svigor, what a great comment, and as I reflect on the way posts have been running where I post, I think you&rsquo;re right, I think it&rsquo;s slowly happening.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before, and I thank you for such an insightful and hopeful comment.</p>

		<p>The girl should have gone home instead of dating the black in the first place, NOW whe will be bothered to no end until, as mentioned, she gives in, gives up, gets murdered or pregnant by one of them. Her friends KNEW what they were doing when they set this up.</p>

		<p>She obviously has a circle of liberal friends. Funny how they didn&rsquo;t sense her &#8220;racist&#8221; attitudes before this and either try to re-educate her, or failing that, dump her. Certainly she ought to dump them for putting her into such an awkward postion to have to tell this poor fellow this blind date was not going to happen. I don&rsquo;t know what she told him, but I suppose even if she said it was always her policy to stick to her own kind, that it would still be construed as racist. I wonder if they fixed her up with a lesbian and she refused, then would she also be labeled a homophobe???</p>

		<p>Ah well, at least most of the comments disagree.</p>
<p>As for the people who keep saying &#8216;oh there&rsquo;s so much interracial dating where I live!&rsquo; I think it&rsquo;s more that young people these days (I should know, I&rsquo;m one of them) will sleep with anything that walks on two legs.  I have a white friend(rather redundant, as all my friends are white) who was flirting with a rather unattractive mulatto girl tell me, not ten minutes after we departed from her company, that the world would be a better place without blacks and hispanics.  Needless to say the irony was lost on him.</p>
<p>Also, my cousin slept around with blacks(she was quite the problem child regardless, however, and I suspect it was just a way to infuriate her mother), but when it came time to marry she picked a white guy.</p>

		<p>Honestly, since communism won, &#8220;racist&#8221; has become a silly-ism like &#8220;doo-doo head&#8221;.  At least to me.  If I dislike someone for any reason, that&rsquo;s a thought in my brain, not a &#8220;crime&#8221; or &#8220;offense&#8221; but my natural being at work.</p>

		<p>In the worst case scenario, something like this happens: <br>
 (Go the Green Arrow blog:  Sarah of Albion to see full article). <br>
 The sister of West Ham soccer player Calum Davenport <br>
Cara, her mother and brother were involved in an acrimonious family argument on Sunday night, when Calum and his mother expressed their disapproval at the company Cara had been keeping.</p>
<p>It seems that they may well have had good reason for their concerns, given that shortly afterwards, either by reason of his telepathic powers, or having been called by Cara, the undesirable &ldquo;company&rdquo; she had been keeping turned up, in the form or Cara&rsquo;s mixed race boyfriend Worrell Whitehurst. Allegedly Whitehurst then proceeded to assault Mrs Davenport, to the extent that she required hospital treatment, and then repeatedly stabbed Calum Davenport in both legs.</p>
<p>According to witnesses, Whitehurst behaved like a mad man during the attack screaming &ldquo;This is what you get when you f*** around. You don&rsquo;t f*** with us.&rdquo; (I leave it to you to speculate as to what he may have meant by that.)</p>
<p>Calum Davenport, who also sustained head injuries, and his mother were rushed to hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. Although his life now appears to be out of danger, it is not yet clear whether the doctors will be able to save his legs, or whether he will ever play football again.</p>
<p>Whitehurst was arrested, and the following day Cara showed where her loyalty lay, turning up in court weeping and mouthing &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; as the man accused of assaulting her mother and probably crippling her brother appeared in the dock.</p>
<p>Worrell Whitehurst has yet to stand trial and, as such the allegations against him remain unproven, However, as far as the heavily pregnant Cara Davenport the situation is somewhat different, she &#8220;has form&#8221;, as the British cops put it, this is not her first ride on the multicultural ghost train. She already has a previous child fathered by Jamaican gangster Neville Knight, who is currently serving a twelve year sentence for a string of armed robberies, committed together with another identicate, spread legged, white girl he apparently dumped Cara for.</p>
<p>No doubt Cara once claimed that she &ldquo;loved&rdquo; Neville also, however, given that she apparently sought out two such similar beaux one has to question to what degree &ldquo;love&rdquo; is her motive. Do those who are drawn to dangerous and abusive characters feel &ldquo;love&rdquo; or are they following some other less wholesome need?.</p>
<p>Woman like Cara Davenport and the, thankfully smaller, number of men who do the same are one of the greatest threats which any nation faces. Any other damage caused by this multicultural nightmare which is currently being imposed upon us has the possibility of being put right. Politicians can be defeated, laws and minds can be changed and migrants can return to their homelands but the damage they do can never be put right.</p>
<p>They, or Satsumas as I call them on account of the orange fake tan they trend to favour, are a true enemy within, and the harm they do is incalculable, it is for that reason older and wiser generations shunned them, excluded them from decent society and, in the case of our European cousins, shaved their empty, shameless, heads in the streets of liberated Paris.</p>
<p>They know nothing of loyalty or honour and care no more about their country and their people than Cara cares about her devastated family and they are amongst our greatest of enemies.</p>
<p>Cara Davenport&rsquo;s is a face we see too often in modern Britain and it is an ugly, ugly face.</p>

		<p>We should also look at the STD rates in blacks compared to whites.<br>
What sort of &#8216;friends&rsquo; would want their &#8216;friend&rsquo; dating somebody who statistically was FAR more likely to have an STD?<br>
And FAR more likely to physically assault, and even murder them?</p>
<p>Brainwashed &#8216;friends&rsquo; that who.</p>
<p>We need SEPARATION NOW.</p>
<p>Quote of the day:<br>
&#8220;So white people who simply want non-involvement with other races - i.e. to simply live with their own kind, are &#8220;white supremacists&#8221;? That&rsquo;s like calling a woman who refuses a man&rsquo;s sexual advances a &#8220;female supremacist.&#8221;&#8220;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time for Whites to face this issue head on.  The TRUTH is, that all over America young White women are being pressured into relationships with Blacks.  Black males ask for a date, and tell the girl she is &#8220;racist&#8221; if she won&rsquo;t accept.  If she refuses, she faces peer pressure from her &#8220;shocked&#8221; friends as well as the huge 5th column of media idiots like &#8220;Carolyn&#8221; who try to program her 24/7 with the idea that interracial dating is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>These tactics are very successful because of an all-too-common White failing: the desperate desire to be liked.  Being labeled a racist results in societal rejection, and it&rsquo;s a fact of life that many people are terrified by the idea of being excluded from their circle of friends.  On a larger scale, Whites in general are intimidated into supporting policies that damage their own interests to avoid the societal costs of being labeled a racist.  Those costs can include broken friendships and family relationships; reprimands or dismissal from academic, employment, and church groups; even government sanctions in the form of hate crime / thought crime charges.</p>
<p>Whites have let this word intimidate them for far too long.  Even in the pages of AR, intelligent people agonize over what to call themselves that will be more politically correct to our enemies.</p>
<p>At this point, people reading my post will probably gasp.  &#8220;Enemies? Isn&rsquo;t that a bit harsh?&#8221;  The answer is of course &#8220;NO, it&rsquo;s NOT harsh.  It&rsquo;s entirely accurate.&#8221;  This isn&rsquo;t a game, people.  The opposition is working aggressively and continually to dispossess you and wipe your culture, your people, and your future from the pages of history.  Every White female they convince to reproduce with a non-White brings your destruction one step closer.</p>
<p>We are under siege, and cowering under fear of having a LABEL applied to us will not help us win the battle.  </p>
<p>So what do we do?  Very simple - just refuse to acknowledge or accept any labels the opposition tries to hang on you.  &#8220;Am I a racist?  Of course not, I am simply pro-White, and working to advance the interests of my people and culture the same way that other groups work to advance their interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>The opposition has cleverly defended interracial dating over the years with the simple comment that &#8220;We don&rsquo;t choose who we love.&#8221;  I encourage every White female reading this message to use that same comment to defend their preference for White males.  When someone objects to your refusal to date non-Whites, simply tell them &#8220;The heart likes what it likes, and my preference is for White men.  I don&rsquo;t have to defend my preference, and it&rsquo;s hateful and close-minded of you to insist that I do.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I never considered non white men for dating because I knew I wanted white children.  Having married a white man and having two children I can tell you what marriage is really about - having the most attractive, healthy and intelligent kids.  Marriage is about producing the next generation and improving the race.  Marriages based on following fads, based on jungle fever, sex or material gain will usually fail.  The best marriages are where the couple is the same race, same religion and same culture.  Too many whites are degrading their genes by mixing with non whites.  Their offspring on average are plain jane, less intelligent and at risk for certain health problems.</p>

<p>Some very good posts on here, yet there are a few who do not seem to mind having friends, etc. of another race. Why is that? You cannot have it both ways. You bring your friends into your family and into the lives of your White sisters, brothers, etc. Is that good? I don&rsquo;t think so. Our race is dying simply because of this mind set. Separation is the only answer if our race is to survive. Remember we are only 8% of the global population!  8%, people! Do you know how drastic our situation has become? </p>

 I agree completely. But on the other hand, guys knocking at my front door tell me all kinds of things. But it`s up to me to be convinced or conned or whatever. Then it`s my choice AGAIN whether to act on what they tell me. So the ultimate power and responsibility falls on the female.</p>

Europe and Russia do not succumb to the multiculturalism/multiracialism that the West will fall to.  It is painfully obvious that many Amren people are hopeless about saving their race.  Alot is made about the women dating black men but white males are ultimately responsible for their civilization and it&rsquo;s failures.

Close comment:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think she is racist at all. I am a black woman who has said something similar; I prefer to date BLACK men. Do I have anything &hellip; read more against interacial dating? No, to each its own. (I have a handful of biracial cousins.) But do I hate other men of other races? No. I just prefer black men, and I really don&rsquo;t see myself dating any other race. It is definitely natural and shouldn&rsquo;t be mistaken for something else. Why do people throw RACISM into everything? It seems as if we have lost sight of what the word really means.&#8221;</p>

        Purity is more important for women. It&rsquo;s unfair but also just a biological fact of life. When Whites held the power we could have affair with Black Women and there was little harm done. The offspring were Black-end of story. But now, under profound legal and economic threat, we don&rsquo;t have this luxury any more. We best keep all our energy for our own Women-even if they hate us.

<p>As far as I am concerned, no one is &#8220;forcing&#8221; or &#8220;pressuring&#8221; us Whites to do this. This line of argument is a lame excuse to  deny what is happening to our race. The diminising level of morality is disgraceful!  </p>

		<p>As Amren regular readers know, I am prone to conspiracy theories mainly because so many of them turn out to be true. I also believe nothing, but nothing in the MSM. </p>
<p>I really think the writer made the entire thing up.  She betrays her mendacity in the first sentence.  </p>
<p>The women&rsquo;s friends kept telling her about this great guy.  But they never mentioned that he is black?  It seems that the friends spent some time talking about the guy.  I can see that if the date was quickly arranged for the next evening the friends might not have mentioned it. But if they talked about it over a period of time, they would have mentioned his race.</p>
<p>I really question that the friends did not metnion his race.  Generally, in black white blind dates race is always mentioned.  If the name is Asian, or Hispanic or Middle Eastern it is obvious, but usually the race is mentioned if one of the parties is black.</p>
<p>I really question this statement.  I believe it is totally false.<br>
&#8220;I told my friends why I wouldn&rsquo;t be seeing him again, and they were, shockingly, horrified&#8221;</p>
<p>I spent decades in the dating game.  The woman seems totally confident that the guy will call her and that she has the option of rejecting him. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way Carolyn, as you would know if you ever dated.  </p>
<p>She does not have to call him.  If she doesn&rsquo;t want to see him all she has to do is wait to reject him WHEN AND IF the man calls her.  Before she rejects him, she has to wait and see if he wants to see her.  Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t want to see her either.</p>
<p>Then too, I&rsquo;ve never heard of blacks going on blind dates.  Maybe they do.  But having worked with a lot of black women, I heard a lot about their baby daddies and men in their lives.  I don&rsquo;t recall any of them going on blind dates.  They seemed to have met their men in person.  </p>
<p>Of course from this small sample of black women I can&rsquo;t say that blacks don&rsquo;t go on blind dates, but I never heard of a black going on a blind date. </p>
<p>This entire little article is obviously made up as (1) A space filler (2) part of the ongoing propaganda war against whites.  Carolyn probably has several maudlin race relations  articles like this on file somewhere.  </p>
<p>She probably has articles on: </p>
<p>(1)&#8221;Why do black women press their hair?&#8221; </p>
<p>(2) &#8220;The shame of affirmative action, Why oh why do my fellow Harvard medical school students assume I got in on affirmative action?&#8221;  </p>
<p>(3) &#8220;White women are prejudiced neo-nazis because they clutch their purses and looked scared when I and 3 of my thuggish homies jump in the elevator with them&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a standard keep on file as space filler type of article.</p>
<p>This date never happened.  The woman asking Carolyn is she is racist doesn&rsquo;t exist and neither does the black guy she went out with.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&rsquo;t it clear that the Sexual Revolution was necessary to complete the Civil Rights Revolution? And it ought to be clear to race realists that Christianity is necessary. </p>
<p>Sex is for procreation. If not so, and girls believe that sex is for fun and enjoyment why not get laid by a black guy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Hmmm,&hellip; Maybe God should not have made it feel so good?</p>
<p>Christianity is part of the problem.  It makes impossible demands of human beings, who backslide on Saturday night and repent the next morning in church.  During my long career as a single doctor, I cannot count the number of married, Christian women who offered, even pursued me for an extra-marital affair.  It actually caused me to remain single as I decided that an American woman was more likely to betray me than not.  Either that, or find myself married to a frigid woman.  </p>
<p>In the past, all Christianity did was marry off people young, so that they would not be able to &#8220;sin.&#8221;  A &#8220;sinning&#8221; female was often sent off to a Nunnery, where she usually got pregnant by a monk or engaged in homosexuality.</p>
<p>This is just what we need, to repeat the long dehumanizing history of the rule of the church. (sacrasm intended)</p>
<p>Christianity creates hypocrites, and a culture of guilt.  That guilt culture has been appropriated in the racial debate and coupled with other Christain demands such as forgiving, turning the cheek, giving of ones wealth and sacrificing oneself for others, and being equal in the eyes of God.  Christianity was &#8220;multi-cultural&#8221; at its birth and has always sought to include. every race and people, every person in the world.  There is not mention of white people or any races or ethnic grouops exclusivity (except for Jews in the OT).  The best whites can do is pretend that they are Jews, like the Mormons do, and African American slaves have.  Maybe that is really why so many Christians hate Jews, sibling rivalry!</p>
<p>What the White race needs is a solid foundation in the philosophy of ethics.  Once and for all, the white race needs a new philosophy that is not based on mythology and ridiculous claims and a set of directives that defeat progress.  IN this case, it is defeating the progress of a race that wishes to survive.  The ethics of race survival would be one good chapter in that book!</p>

		<p>Another point to be emphasized is that this is an exchange (and perhaps, as margaret so persuasively argued, an apocryphal one) between two liberal <i>white</i> women.  Most <i>black</i> women would not be concerned with the supposed &#8220;racism&#8221; of the Sacramento advice seeker in rejecting black men for dates, and they would not at all be impressed by the presumptuous racial &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; which &#8220;Carolyn&#8221; so sanctimoniously displays. <p>Black women don&rsquo;t want black men going out with white women, any more than sensible white men want them to.</p></p>

		<p>It seems to me that a significant portion of the white female population is predisposed to violent tendencies.  This parting from and betrayal of the white race on the part of females is both conscious and deliberate.  Many commentors on this blog view this is as a political issue, but I believe it to be one of genetics in much the same way as one may be predisposed to alcohol or drug addiction, say.  It is possible that women of this type confer some sort of advantage upon the their &#8220;tribal group&#8221; by producing the most violent, risk-taking and physically endowed of the pack.  If you look across the spectre of interracial dating, you will see that most of the white women are physically endowed be they tall, broad-shouldered, many are fat but with physical strength at the far end of the scale and most typically aggressive traits.  It seems that the obvious dispossession of white males by government and social forces as well as empowerment of women in general has accelerated and heightened this pairing of aggressive white female types with black men.  To my mind these are blood thirsty vultures that see the kill (of white men) happening and are allying themselves with a group (black or a mixed race people) who would usurp power.  To those on this blog who have stated that this is essentially a racial war, I would wholly agree.  It is a fight for genetic and ultimately control of nation and destiny.</p>

		<p>I wonder if Carolyn would have said the same thing about judging each person as an individual if it had been a Jewish girl saying that she only wanted to date Jewish guys?  What about a Hispanic girl only wanting to date guys who were native speakers of the Spanish language?  Where exactly is the line between racism and cultural preference?  Does anybody deny the fact that blacks have their own culture?</p>
<p>A man can date women from every race and religion just for fun until he is in his 40s, and then marry somebody &#8220;compatible&#8221; when he is ready to have kids.  Women hear the biological clock ticking a lot sooner, and often aren&rsquo;t willing to begin a dating relationship with someone who isn&rsquo;t their idea of marriage material.  </p>
<p>Black men are not only famous for diseases, cheating and violence, as prior posters have pointed out, they are notorious for being unable to handle money and for having all sorts of substance abuse problems and &#8220;legal issues.&#8221;  I saw an article one time, possibly in Money magazine, which discussed why black families with above average incomes typically had a below average net worth.  The reason was that they generally had multiple down-on-their-luck relatives, and were often raising somebody else&rsquo;s children, etc.  If the white wife is against using the equity in her house as security for Cousin Tyrone&rsquo;s bail bond, all of her husband&rsquo;s relatives will be accusing her of racism, despite the fact that she married a black man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known lapsed Catholics who only dated Catholics because marrying a non-Catholic would have caused all kinds of problems with their parents.  It had nothing to do with disliking Protestants.  In my younger years I knew several women who married &#8220;Westernized&#8221; Middle Eastern Muslims.  All of the marriages were disastrously bad, with one of the women getting stuck in Saudi Arabia because she had a baby who wasn&rsquo;t allowed to leave the country without the husband&rsquo;s permission.  </p>
<p>I have known several black people, both male and female, that I enjoyed working with.  But there is always, ALWAYS the &#8220;walking on eggshells&#8221; aspect of the relationship.  You say ONE wrong thing, or express one idea in the wrong way, and the relationship is going to explode.  </p>
<p>In a cross-racial marriage, the extended family and in-law aspects are bound to be difficult, and marriage is so hard in the first place.  The more you have in common, the better your chance of making your marriage a success.  If a white woman marries a black man, the black man is likely to be angry after every Thanksgiving or Christmas with the white inlaws, as he will feel that they wouldn&rsquo;t have done such and such or have said this or that, if he had been white.  When the white woman spends a holiday with the black inlaws, she may be hearing her mother in law or sister in law speaking openly about how white women should not be stealing black men from black women.  </p>
<p>As her biracial kids get older, she will have an uphill battle to keep them from hanging around with Cousin Tyrone&rsquo;s kids in the &#8216;hood.  Her black husband may back her up if they are still married, but if they are divorced, the kids will be spending half of their time keepin&rsquo; it real.  The court system may even give the black ex-husband primary custody of the kids since he and the kids are black, while mom is white, and can&rsquo;t possibly understand the black cultural values that the black kids share with their black dad.</p>
<p>Even in this day and age I don&rsquo;t believe that this woman&rsquo;s so-called friends innocently set her up on an interracial blind date.  They WANTED to &#8220;see what would happen.&#8221;  She needs to get some new friends.</p>

		<p>Stop all the doomsday talk here.  The number of interracial marriages and offspring has risen in recent years but it&rsquo;s still a small fraction of the total.  As others here have stated, the divorce rate for mixed race marriages is higher than same race marriages.  As the married father of three beautiful white children I can say that we have to promote the beauty of our race, and our race&rsquo;s accomplishments early in children&rsquo;s lives.  We have images of great European cities and art around our house.  Keep the message positive.  You&rsquo;ll get a much more positive response from your children.</p>

		<p>A white woman should have a right to reject blackmen because of their race if they want. I&rsquo;m sorry but as a white male I don&rsquo;t find many non-whites that attractive, and I will say so if I dam please. I&rsquo;m sure many non-whites find their race attractive more than they find other races attractive. </p>
<p>To call someone racist because they won&rsquo;t date outside of their race is childish. I myslef am not scared of being called racist. To use racism as a means to force white woman to date non-whites is a form of &#8220;mental slavery&#8221; and genocidal to the white race. People of all races need to condemn this mental torture that is used to mix races and genocide races. This is a form of racism itself.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have our media, our schooling, our government. The same way Communist indoctrinated you, we&rsquo;re being indoctrinated, only we are wealthier and sit back without fighting. Everyone is to comfortable with their lives, and everything they learn in school distracts their natural mindset.</p>
<p>Being pro-white in America is like being pro-Nazi in Germany. There is this whole mindset, a mental slave type mindset that if hard to break. Picture this, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the internet white Americans wouldn&rsquo;t have any voice.</p>
<p>There is no free speech in America, it&rsquo;s a lie. We have no free media, it&rsquo;s controlled by a few elite. We have no control of our schools. Our schools are run by the government, the same government which is run by a 2 party system which is lobby to the wealthy and non-whites. America over the past 60 years has practically turned into a Communist government with a two-party system. If your pro-white in America you can be fired, and in some cases arrested for hate. Please,you have to live in America to understand. </p>
<p>The liberals are extremly wealthy in America and have vast power over much of the government and media. The liberal American media is so powerful they can pratically turn the whole world against you if you became their target. Even the Conservative media which is only Fox news is quite liberal by historical American standerds.</p>

<p>What a good post&hellip;I especially liked the last half that began with the above quote.</p>
<p>Regarding that quote and what follows, not only have you described a major impediment to close cross-racial personal relationships, you&rsquo;ve also described why an integrated society as a whole functions less well.</p>
<p>E.g. neighborhood meetings can&rsquo;t discuss the problem of crime with any realism, because that gets too close to race. A city can&rsquo;t have ANY meetings at ANY level that addresses crime or any other urban problems realistically, because the discussions will impinge on race.</p>
<p>Similarly at all levels of government and society.</p>
<p>Related to this are Harvard professor Robert Putnam&rsquo;s studies showing that all manifestations of civic and societal cohesion are weaker under multiculturalism.<br>

<p>I agree with you that one big reason why black or mixed race households have less net wealth than white households even when controlling for aggregate income is that the black(s) will all of a sudden have relatives knocking on their door that they never knew existed, when they get two nickels to rub together.</p>
<p>But another big reason is that blacks tend to be more impulsive in their consumption than whites, especially if both spouses are black.  If one is white, especially the woman, this might put a brake on some of the instant gratification of the two combined.  But with blacks, you know the one cookie now vs the five cookies tomorrow axiom.  Translate that to working adults, and you get one plasma flat screen TV now vs tens of thousands of dollars for retirement at age 65.</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity from 138 Anon:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m white and I was married to a white man who was a spendthrift, and had other &#8220;impulse control&#8221; issues.  Have some pity for the white woman who ends up with the role of discouraging instant gratification behavior in her husband, whether he is black or white.  </p>
<p>If I argued with my husband BEFORE a purchase (&#8220;we can&rsquo;t afford it&#8221;) or immediately afterwards (&#8220;take it back to the store&#8221;) then I was a castrating b**** who was denigrating his earning ability.  If I said nothing, then I had no right to criticize later when the bills for the purchases began to roll in, because he would say that the purchase was a mutual decision because I hadn&rsquo;t said anything prior to the purchase.  </p>
<p>If I was working full-time I had no right to complain because he earned a lot more money that I did, and if I was such a financial genius, why didn&rsquo;t I earn more money?  If I was staying home with the children, then I had no right to complain because he had the right to make all the financial decisions, because he was earning all the money and paying all the bills.  </p>
<p>I used to tell him that he had &#8220;ghetto&#8221; financial patterns, and he never directly denied it.  He would strenuously defend each unaffordable purchase, but he never wanted to discuss his overall spending patterns, which were indeed &#8220;ghetto.&#8221;  </p>
<p>He often made his major purchases when I was out of town.  When he was making a major purchase, he was the man of the family.  When the bills rolled in, it was time for &#8220;teamwork,&#8221; and it was pointless to try to assess blame for whatever unfortunate decisions might have been made in the past.  When he was in DEEP trouble, he would browbeat me into handing over my savings, and in exchange, I would get some elaborate agreement as to how the finances would be handled in the future, as well as his sacred word of honor not to ever run up the credit cards again.     </p>
<p>At the time we divorced, our credit card debt was almost DOUBLE our annual household income.  Oddly enough, he came from an upper-middle-class background, and his parents were very normal with money.  They earned a good income, they lived well, and they left behind a substantial estate when they died. </p>
<p>Although I left off &#8220;impulsiveness&#8221; from my list of unattractive features of the average black male, impulsiveness alone is an excellent reason NOT to marry a man.  If the guy likes to talk about his &#8220;spontaneity,&#8221; run for your life.  </p>
<p>No woman should be expected to provide the brakes for a man who has no brakes of his own.  I wonder if this is part of the reason that black men are often so violent with their wives and girlfriends.  They need a full-time mommy figure to supervise them at all times so that they don&rsquo;t make decisions that are disastrously bad for the rest of the family, but they can&rsquo;t deal with anybody questioning their male authority to have the final say in each and every decision.  Family arguments are going to be long and loud and involve pushing and shoving or worse, and whatever happens, it is always Mommy&rsquo;s Fault because she didn&rsquo;t apply the brakes properly.  </p>

<p>Alas, this is all so common.</p>
<p>Too bad you had to learn this in hindsight!  Hope you are able to recover your sanity and start to rebuild your finances.  </p>
<p>I agree with Dr. Laura when she says it takes at least TWO years to get to know someone inside and out (some will say this is not possible ever)  &mdash;  but during that time period, impulsiveness and other undesirable consequences should show themselves.  That&rsquo;s why it is imperative to WAIT and learn before combining your life  &mdash;   and especially your finances  &mdash;   with someone else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes your loved ones will point things out about your intended that you  refuse to see (because you&rsquo;re in love)  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s only after tremendous damage is done that you wished you&rsquo;d listened to them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why some women hire private detectives to dig into their fiancee&rsquo;s finances before it&rsquo;s too late  &mdash;  their debt burden now becomes YOUR debt burden!  This has happened to several of my female family members who found themselves strapped with crushing debt including back child support payments, divorce settlements, bankruptcy mandates, and astronomical credit card debt (one cousin found out her new husband had several &#8216;old cars&rsquo; that need special storage to the tune of $600/month plus an ex-wife that had a court-ordered  alimony settlement of $1,000/month). </p>
<p>I knew when I got married to keep my finances separate from my husband&rsquo;s (it&rsquo;s been over 25 years now)  &mdash;  the men in my family warned me repeatedly to trust no one when it comes to money, advice I tell my own children.  It may not work for everyone, but it&rsquo;s worked for us. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Michael C. Scott  &mdash;  when it comes to money, I am humorless.</p>
<p>Turns out old DH is more frugal than I am  &mdash;  and I am of Scottish descent.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sure most AmRenners and whites find ourselves mingling among non-whites almost daily. Having a white identity makes free and open socializing impossible if not difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, you might find that non-whites have more common sense about race than whites.  The other day, I called one of my female colleagues a &#8220;self-hating white liberal&#8221; right to her face, only half in jest.  A mixed colleague in the room chuckled and gave me a high five.  He thought it was hilarious.  </p>
<p>Obviously you have to be careful, but you&rsquo;d be surprised what you can get away with if you keep it light.  Remember that blacks are, like it or not, a founding population in the country.  They are not going anywhere and they are not aliens.  Their ancestors have been here longer than many whites&rsquo;.  Show a genuine concern for the less fortunate, and respect the competent and intelligent blacks you know, and you really don&rsquo;t have to hide the fact that you are a proud white.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t blame anybody but myself for marrying Mr. Wrong, but I do think that parents and church youth groups should spend some time telling high school kids that probably 20% of the population at a minimum is absolutely incapable of having a successful marriage with anyone.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK to talk about the importance of forgiveness and staying married for life and communication skills and seeing the other person&rsquo;s point of view but it is CRITICAL to point out to the young and inexperienced that LOTS of people cannot form a true marriage with anybody, and many of these people are full-blown sociopaths or narcissists who will make each and every day of your life a living Hell, even after the inevitable divorce.  </p>
<p>A few years after my divorce, I saw a letter to Dear Abby or Ann Landers from an 85-year-old woman who was working full time seating people as they came into a restaurant.  Her husband, who had retired, ran around town during the day while she was at work, and charged stuff onto joint credit cards that she had to make payments on each month from her salary.  She wanted to know if she would be stuck with the credit card debt if her husband predeceased her, and of course the answer to that question is YES.  I realized then that even if my husband had left me deeply in debt, at least I had a reasonable hope of being able to retire before age 85, whereas if the marriage had lasted longer, I would simply have been left with less time to make up the years that the locust had eaten. </p>
<p>LA is Burning:  Both of my parents were overly thrifty, and I was relieved when I married my husband that I was getting away from their cheese-paring ways.  Little did I know.  At least each of my parents had a basic sense of fairness (they had shared financial goals, and neither made a major purchase without consulting the other.)  My ex and I had completely different standards of living from each other DURING the marriage.  The joke was on me.  I ended up strapped for cash and worried sick about financial problems in a way that my mother never had to experience, while my husband spent money like there was no tomorrow, fully confident that Wifey would scrimp and save a little bit more here and there in order to keep up the payments on his latest purchases.   </p>
<p>If we had gone through the sort of church-sponsored pre-marital counseling that goes on today, I think that our marriage would have been prevented.  I don&rsquo;t know if anything is said during these pre-marriage classes about the risks of interracial marriage, I doubt it, but most of these marriages have a tremendous amount of conflict.   </p>

		<p>sofita, thanks for those wise and gentle words. That&rsquo;s what I was thinking of when I called for a Dear Abby for whites. I&rsquo;m pretty sure there would be a demand for that sort of thing if only there was a way to supply it.  </p>

		<p>Maybe she doesn&rsquo;t want to be abused, cheated on, left to be the primary breadwinner, etc&hellip; but statistically wants the best home she can make. Good for her.</p>
<p>And Whiteplight, thanks for your kind words in July. I&rsquo;m doing a little better. Getting some med care now. Peace.</p>

		<p>Carolyn Hax copped out. She made it a race thing. Hax said it would have been fine if the gal on the blind date with the black guy had said that she simply found him unattractive. What would Hax have said if the womans opinion was that she found blacks unattractive in general? Just a what if. I&rsquo;m not saying I think all blacks are unattractive. Hax made it a race thing, like all liberals do. These are simply the kind of head games they play endlessly. I say this sincerely,I have found liberal progressives to be the biggest hypocrits in the world. The vast majority of liberals, and I&rsquo;ve known many,never,ever, practice what they preach. I&rsquo;ve seen it, over and over.</p>

		<p><i>I have many white female acquiantances who get rude and very arrogant advances from black men only to be called &ldquo;racist&rdquo; and &ldquo;once you&rsquo;re black, you don&rsquo;t go back.&rdquo; I have SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES at dance clubs how very forward and black guys can be towards white females.</i></p>
<p>That happened to a girl in Baltimore who was out with some friends in Fells Point last year.  She blew the black guy off and apparently he got offended, because he walked up to their car as they were stuck in a traffic jam when all the bars in FP emptied out, and shot her in the neck.  She is paralyzed for life now because she didn&rsquo;t want to get mugged.</p>
