<h1>Recipient of Heart Transplant Promotes Organ Donation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Harrt Jackson Jr., St. Louis Post â€“Dispatch, August 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>LaKeisha Coleman, education coordinator with Mid-America Transplant Services, works with Bonds and others to tell black people about organ donation.</p>
<p>Blacks need more donors for certain organs such as kidneys and lungs because they&rsquo;re harder to match outside of ethnic groups, she said.</p>
<p>Statistics from Mid-America Transplant Services, based in St. Louis, say that this year in the St. Louis region, 61 percent of black people eligible to sign donor permissions, have done so, compared to 93 percent of white people.</p>
<p>The challenge, they say, is that too many blacks don&rsquo;t trust the transplant system. They fear their organs would be taken from blacks prematurely to save white patients. And they point to medical atrocities committed in the United States against black people, as well as continuing disparities in medical care for black people.</p>
<p>Coleman said transplants are anonymous and handled by different agencies. &#8220;The doctor who (harvests) the organs won&rsquo;t be the same who does the transplant surgery,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of that &#8220;All in the Family&#8221; episode in which Archie needs surgery and gets some blood from a black donor. In an argument with his liberal son-in-law Meathead, he fears that his white corpsuckles (sic) would get mugged by the black corpsuckles (sic) in his bloodstream if he ever received non-white blood. When he leaves the hospital he is told not to be surprised if he develops a craving for watermelons or some such. I miss the good old pre-PC days when this kind of humor was allowed. Today, everyone would be offended and this harmless fun would be branded racist, hate-mongering, insensitive, etc., etc., etc.</p>

		<p>This article highlights the fascinating way blacks think:</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenge, they say, is that too many blacks don&rsquo;t trust the transplant system. They fear their organs would be taken from blacks prematurely to save white patients. And they point to medical atrocities committed in the United States against black people, as well as continuing disparities in medical care for black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it is OK for white organs to be used to save blacks but not the other way around? </p>
<p>Good grief! Will the paranoia and self-centeredness of this group ever end?<br>

<p>This white fears his organs will be removed at any point in time, premature or not, and given to a black, a member of a race that refuses to donate organs (or much of anything else).</p>
<p>Actually he doesn&rsquo;t, because he&rsquo;s stopped filling out organ donor forms, based on the shenanigans he&rsquo;s been reading about.  They can take my money via taxes and give it to blacks; if they want to do the same with my organs, they&rsquo;ll have to make that involuntary, too.</p>

		<p>Ok so here&rsquo;s an idea. Draw up a contract with these transplant services that says any organ donating will only go to a person of the same race, and have a family member oversee that their wishes are carried out. Whites of course will do the same. Now, since 93 percent of whites will donate their organs VS 61 percent of blacks, that sounds fair to me.</p>

<p>That &#8220;All in the Family&#8221; series was nothing more than liberal propaganda.  If you notice in every situation concerning race or liberal ideology, he capitulated.  He had black neighbors he became friends with and allowed a crossdresser in his house.  </p>

<p>I think they tried it as lib propaganda, but it worked in the opposite direction.  It served to legitimize the right-thinking racial attitudes of whites at the time.  Norman Lear thought he was being smug and funny, turns out he was too clever by half.</p>

<p>I am surprised the numbers are this high.  I am not an organ donor.  I think there is a limit to how much doctors can do before they begin to bend the rules of nature so much that they are in fact substituting their own power and judgment for God&rsquo;s.  Next thing you know we&rsquo;ll all be kept alive indefinitely by artificial parts a la Darth Vader.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not anti-medicine, in fact I think that what whites have acheived in this field is among the best evidence that we are created with a pupose rather than evolved by mere chance.  But it just seems to me we&rsquo;we got to draw the line somewhere.</p>

<p>I imagine that such a contract would be legally unenforcible, or that any hospital/physician would refuse to comply. But it would certainly be a fascinating test case.  (And can you imagine the outrage it would stir up in the media?  They would be all over it!)</p>
<p>Perhaps you could just leave it up to a relative to approve or disapprove,with no reasons given.  I wonder if you have the option of choosing/refusing  your recipient?<br>

<p>Maybe the author has a different definition than I do, but when I hear a phrase like &#8220;medical atrocities&#8221; I think Birkenau (sp?) and the like. I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;re a far cry from that here.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;White organs will be disproportionately steered to blacks and other minorities&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Also illegal aliens and other foreign nationals (in California, especially in SoCal where I live, I, as a White, am a minority but I&rsquo;ll bet my retirement that THAT won&rsquo;t get me special treatment or priority for an organ). </p>
<p>This is why it is imperative to Spread The Word.  Tell everyone you know and care about the truth about how organs are distributed.  Implore your loved ones to take their names off of organ donor lists and make your wishes known to your next of kin  &mdash;  tell them your organs will not  be subjected to government-mandated distribution of scarce organs that favors blacks (who will NEVER donate to YOU) as recipients.</p>
<p>I recently took my 15-year old son to the DMV to get his driving permit. On the form where &#8220;organ donor yes or no&#8221; was listed, he knew to check NO.  He already knows that as his next of kin, I will not donate his organs.</p>
<p>And he knows why.</p>
<p>Spread the Word.</p>

		<p>number 2 observer wrote about the &#8221;all in the family&#8221; episode where archie bunker gets some blood for surgery from a black donor. what most everyone doesn&rsquo;t realize is that the liberal producer norman lear played a double whammy on his majority white audience without anyone really noticing. while giving the impression it was un-p.c., it was really making fun of whites and building a noble and altruistic image for blacks at the same time. i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;ve ever heard a white person mispronouce a medical term so poorly while i hear profound mispronounciations of medical terms by blacks almost daily. secondly, blacks are not known for donating blood. <br>
i know these things because i am a former medical technologist that went back to school for a degree in nursing, finishing a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in nursing in 1997. i have been in the medical field since 1989. as a med tech - or lab tech as some say - i used to have coffee with a tech in blood bank. he told me that upwards of 95 percent of blood donors were white and well over 3/4 of recipients were black. <br>
i have worked with blacks in the medical profession for years and it&rsquo;s just amazing how affirmative action allows blacks into nursing and medical schools with much lower grade point averages and admission scores than whites.</p>
<p>i suspect this black cardiologist michael jackson hired to be his full time personal physician was such an affirmative action doctor. this man was paid to be his full-time physician with only one patient to be responsible for&hellip;michael jackson. he apparently let him have a lethal dose of several types of sedatives, one of which never should have been used outside an intensive care hospital setting. this man is facing manslaughter charges at the very least. he&rsquo;s toast. affirmative action sometimes can have deadly consequences. </p>

		<p>Greetings, all. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s truly preposterous is that black organs may not be anywhere near as healthy as white ones.  Aren&rsquo;t blacks always dying off of countless maladies at an earlier average age than whites?  <b>Don&rsquo;t they get AIDS, cancer, sickle-cell anemia and such more often and in greater numbers?</b> Their livers are probably petrified by age 29. </p>
<p>If you get a black organ in a transplant, it&rsquo;s probably a death sentence in disguise. <br>

<p>Although that is true, another point to be made is that many of them CANNOT donate blood   &mdash;   even if they wanted to. Due to the great amount of dissipation that blacks are prone to doing, their blood would not be accepted by any responsible blood bank.<br>

		<p>I agree with what Svigor and NBJ have written.  If I&rsquo;m going to donate my organs or blood, I should have a say in who they go into.  If I can&rsquo;t make my donation conditional in that they help another ethnic Jew, or a white person or whatever - then I won&rsquo;t donate at all.  As a matter of fact, don&rsquo;t be surprised if next time I&rsquo;m at the DMV and they ask me if I want to be an organ donor, I blurt out &#8220;Only if it&rsquo;s guaranteed that my organs will go into a white person&#8221; just to make a point.  But one time I specifically said &#8220;NO&#8221; to the donor question and they put me down as a donor anyway.  You&rsquo;ve got to pay attention.</p>

		<p>#18, you got it right!  Affirmative action &#8220;professionals&#8221; are what they are because some a**hole in the white liberal educational field decided to &#8220;make a level playing field&#8221; in higher education.  What it did was to cheapen the higher education, put unqualified people into highly specialized fields like medicine (hence Michael Jackson&rsquo;s socalled doctor - did anyone notice that on the first day of coverage it was reported that this idiot has over $400,000 in medical judgments against him in Texas???), and thus put the entire population at risk of being &#8220;treated&#8221; by these affirmative action &#8220;professionals,&#8221; who would have been way too stupid to get into their programs if they were white.  Soooo, I try to go only to professionals who are Jewish (excellent), Asian (competent but cold), or generic white (quality varies) - and no others.  There are some exceptions, but they are truly exceptional, at least for me.  You CAN choose, even in HMO&rsquo;s, but you need to be persistent and do your homework.  Do the work and safeguard yourself and your family!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing for blacks that whites aren&rsquo;t as racist as black people and refuse to donate their organs for fear they might end up in black people: Because due to the black racist refusal to donate their own organs, blacks are almost completely dependent upon whitey for transplants. Something like 85% of kidney transplants to blacks come from white folks. But all this doesn&rsquo;t stop blacks from blaming whitey for having a longer wait for transplants than others, due to their own refusal to donate, making organ matches harder. And to top it off, blacks are disproportionately in need of organ transplants, particularly kidney transplants.</p>

		<p>The comment about Norman Lear using Archie Bunker in the All In the Family TV series to paint racially healthy, racially conscious whites as rednecks and ignorant hicks is right on the mark.  </p>
<p>I think it might have been Edmond Connelly, who is an outstanding writer for The Occidental Quarterly, who wrote an excellent article a few years ago that had the title:  &#8220;The Jews of Prime Time&#8221; and he went into considerable detail, explaining how the Hollywood script writers and media executives sought to whittle away at the old, white dominant, traditional American culture and value system.  The Cultural Marxist idea is:  What you wish to destroy, you first must demonize. </p>
<p>Norman Lear wasn&rsquo;t alone; countless TV shows and Hollywood movies have all promoted the basic theme that anything &#8216;white&rsquo; is automatically bad, automatically &#8216;not cool&rsquo; and not &#8216;hip&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This war against White Western people and our civilization dates back to at least the 1940s, friends.  The funny thing is, I used to watch All In the Family and liked the humor - but sided with Archie most of the time.    At the time, I didn&rsquo;t realize what was going on with regards to Cultural Marxism - or I might have hit the &#8216;off&rsquo; switch on my TV.    Like I do now.</p>

		<p>One would have thought that being born into a technologically advanced, prosperous, and overwhelmingly literate society would render American blacks fairly rational in their judgments and opinions, rather than displaying the superstitious ignorance of island cargo cultures.</p>
<p>They fear having their organs &#8220;harvested prematurely&#8221; and given to whites?  I can only interpret this as believing that black organ donors will be assassinated in order to get their organs for white organ recipients.</p>

		<p>  Well, I doubt that they&rsquo;ll be wanting my internal organs as I am a diabetic.  However, even if this was not the case I would not wish to be a donor primarily because it seems so ghoulish. I think science would do far better if they could develop workable synthetic organs.  This would eliminate the risk of transmisible disease and would stop the politicizng of organ transplants.</p>
