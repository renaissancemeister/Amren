<h1>GOP Sees Opportunity with White Voters after Gates Saga</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Weigel, Washington Independent, Aug. 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two weeks after President Obama said that Cambridge, Mass., police had &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221; by arresting Harvard University Prof. Henry Louis Gates for arguing with them inside his home, Republicans are still taking stock of their unexpected political gift.</p>
<p>A Pew Research poll released on July 30 found the president&rsquo;s approval rating among white voters slipping seven points, from 53 percent to 46 percent, explicitly because of their disappointment in the Gates remarks. A CNN/Opinion Research poll released on August 4 found that six out of 10 white voters disagreed with the president&rsquo;s remarks. A Quinnipiac poll released on August 6 found that white voters, by a 2-1 margin, believed that the president had &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221; in talking about Gates.</p>
<p>&#8220;He would have been a whole lot wiser to shut up,&#8221; said Roy Fletcher, a Republican strategist based in Baton Rouge, La. &#8220;He got really close to losing the image he has as a post-racial president. For a few days, the question for a lot of people became, &#8216;Wait a minute. Is he the president of the United States? Or is he just the president of minorities?&rsquo; And that was a really unfortunate thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the Gates saga finally fades from the news cycle  &mdash;  few pollsters or strategists reached by TWI thought it had lasting power, and one compared its short-lived nature to the frothy Gary Condit scandal of 2001  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s left Republicans encouraged about their chances of whittling down the Democrats&rsquo; House and Senate majorities in 2010. The mini-controversy put into focus a fact about the 2009, 2010 and 2011 electorates that Democrats don&rsquo;t enjoy talking about and Republicans don&rsquo;t enjoy bragging about. They will be, as Fletcher put it, &#8220;older and whiter&#8221; than the electorate that put Obama and most Democrats on the Hill into office in 2008. As they try to regain statewide offices in this year&rsquo;s New Jersey and Virginia elections, and as they look ahead to the 2010 midterms, GOP strategists are watching for opportunities to turn white swing voters against the Democrats, and to activate the conservative white voters who turned out sluggishly in Ohio and other 2008 swing states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The problem for Democrats is that the white voters who might sour on the president because, in part, of the race issue are more likely to turn out to vote than the young and black voters who made up his margin of victory in 2008. On Tuesday, Public Policy Polling released a survey of Virginia&rsquo;s 2009 statewide races which showed Democrats losing badly because of lagging enthusiasm from their base. Fifty-two percent of likely voters told the pollster that they had supported McCain in 2008 to only 41 percent who said that they&rsquo;d supported Obama. In November, the state that gave Obama a solid 53-46 victory over McCain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia has a racially polarized electorate,&#8221; explained Tom Jensen, a pollster at PPP. &#8220;In 2008, African-American voters made up 21 percent of the overall vote. If they fall back to 16 percent  &mdash;  that was the turnout level in 2004  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s an overall 5.5 point drop for [Democratic gubernatorial candidate] Creigh Deeds right off the bat.&#8221; (African-American support for Democrats is so lopsided that it costs them more than 1 point of overall support for every point of the overall turnout decline.)</p>
<p>Republican and Democratic strategists alike are aware of numbers like those, and closely watching Virginia and New Jersey for some hint of how the electorate will behave without Barack Obama on the top on the ballot. Tellingly, the NRCC&rsquo;s broad list of 70 possible House Democratic targets in 2010 includes, along with the expected bumper crop of &#8220;wave babies&#8221; elected in 2008, nine members of Congress elected before the Obama win who represent Southern districts with sizable numbers of black voters. A close look at the list, as well as other potential Republican targets, reveals dozens of seats where the historic African-American turnout of 2008 either pushed Democratic challengers over the finish line or gave extra job security for longtime incumbents.</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats alike pointed to several seats in the South and the rust belt as ripe GOP targets in an electorate where, as Fletcher put it, &#8220;Obama nation doesn&rsquo;t show up.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Republican opportunity extends to Senate races where troubled incumbents or conservative candidates in states that voted for Obama may contend with a more favorable electorate. &#8220;Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) would be in a lot of trouble if Barack Obama was at the top of the ballot,&#8221; said PPP&rsquo;s Jensen, referring to two states where African-Americans made up more than 29 percent and 23 percent of the vote in 2008.</p>
<p>Fletcher and other strategists were confident that an Obama backlash was brewing even if race was removed from the equation. The white senior citizens who are turning against the president are doing so because of worries about health care. Conservatives were not ready to bet on Obama further weakening white support for Democrats with another Gates-style gaffe. &#8220;The lock&rsquo;s been jiggled, but the door hasn&rsquo;t been broken down,&#8221; said Graham, who suggested that the Department of Justice&rsquo;s decision to drop a case against the radical New Black Panther Party might be hurting white support for Obama if it got more coverage.</p>
<p>But some strategists were ready to declare the GOP&rsquo;s demographic advantage. Fletcher pointed to a July 20 study of Census data that crunched numbers from 2008 and found that, while minority voter turnout surged, overall turnout declined. Many conservative voters white voters simply didn&rsquo;t turn out. One example of the decline? Barack Obama beat John McCain in Ohio by 258,897 votes, but he only won 73,624 more votes than George W. Bush in his 2004 run against John Kerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three to four percent of the white vote didn&rsquo;t come out last time,&#8221; said Fletcher. &#8220;They&rsquo;re coming out this time.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The Democrats have always played the race card.  The GOP, however, has been derelict in emphasizing this to the white electorate.  </p>
<p>The GOP continues to offer up candidates like McCain and Bush, who do little to differentiate themselves from the Democrats.  Did Affirmative Action end under Bush?  Did racial set asides end under Bush?  No.  In fact, those programs increased.  Bush actually help create the mortgage fiasco by encouraging affirmative action style mortgage loans to minorities. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;A CNN/Opinion Research poll released on August 4 found that six out of 10 white voters disagreed with the president&rsquo;s remarks. A Quinnipiac poll released on August 6 found that white voters, by a 2-1 margin, believed that the president had &lsquo;acted stupidly&rsquo; in talking about Gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just wondering myself, how many AR readers and posters think that the Republicans have acted just as stupidly here and continue to do so, regardless of the obvious &ldquo;unexpected political gift&rdquo; they might get in 2010? Let us imagine a best case scenario for Congressional Republicans in 2010, and they manage to grab a 55 seat majority in the US House and a 2 to 5 seat majority in the US Senate. Then what?</p>
<p>Will they learn from the mistakes they made with regard to racial demographics, as they should have, but did not in 1994; or will they subsequently begin a new &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; voter &ldquo;recruitment&rdquo; contest of pandering and even outright groveling with the Democrats, for nonwhite support again? </p>
<p>For about roughly 32 years now, from approximately 1968 to 2008 with minor exceptions, the Republicans could have legally and with reasonably little bloodshed, managed at a minimum to maintain a 85% or greater white majority via the Congress and White House in one grouping or another. What have they done instead?</p>
<p>They have squandered their political gifts and come close to destroying an entire country, in the name of a sickness of the mind and soul called Multiculturalism. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Black militants and obsessives wanted President Obama to maintain his hardline stance against the Cambridge cop.  Had the President done that, his approval rating among whites would be even lower now.</p>
<p>Barack Obama didn&rsquo;t win Louisiana, so working on the assumption that the top of the ballot affects downballot in Presidential election years, McCain&rsquo;s win would have been Vitter&rsquo;s win.  Now, Obama and Beverly Perdue barely won in NC, though Kay Hagan&rsquo;s victory over Liddy Dole was wider.  However, Liddy Dole had her own set of problems that Richard Burr wouldn&rsquo;t have, if Burr would have had to run for re-elect last year.</p>

<p>The fact that so many whites believe or believed Obama to be post-racial proves that a good pursuasive argument (a good speaking voice and some fancy slogans) trumps all logic. Even after Jeremiah Wright and Obama&rsquo;s two somewhat anti-white, anti-Western books, how can so many white folks not get it yet?  It&rsquo;s us and them and we better start thinking about us, or the future will be theirs and only theirs.<br>

		<p>Expect the GOP to once again play a prevent-zone defense, and not go on the attack. After reading this article, I had the feeling that the Republican Party is still too afraid to bring up the race issue.</p>
<p>So, it takes the Gates controversy to wake up Republican politicians? You mean they weren&rsquo;t aware to begin with? <br>
Sigh, just more of the same. </p>

		<p>Yes, white voters, turn out to knock out liberal Obama supporters. </p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t vote for Republican incumbents unless they are true conservatives like Tom Coburn or Jim DeMint. Republicans voted for Judge Sonia, Medicare prescription, and helped build the deficit that will lead to a Chinese takeover. </p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget immigration: if a Republican(e.g. McCain) voted for amnesty or has been wishy washy on EVerify or on the border fence, send them back to Mexico where they belong. </p>
<p>Finally, ask the campaigns of Republican candidates if they totally oppose affirmative action. If you get a &#8220;well er&#8221; answer, say bye bye, go to work for once in your useless life.</p>

		<p>The fact is that the GOP has sold out White voters for the past 30 plus years! If they beleive that this minor incident (that is really what it is if we are being honest)is going to earn them the former loyal White voters that they have horrendously betrayed, then the party is sadly mistaken.</p>

		<p>In order for the GOP to get its base - white conservatives - to come out and vote for them, they will need to stop pandering so much to minorities by doing things such as offering 20,000,000 illegal aliens, most of whom are Hispanic, amnesty. Furthermore, the GOP will have to stop having liberal Republicans, like John McCain and George W. Bush, run for office.</p>
<p>I personally voted for a third-party candidate in the 2008 election instead voting for the GOP specifically because I felt like the Republican presidential candidate did not represent my interests. Instead, it appeared like he represented the interests of corporate lobbyists, minorities and the neocons.</p>
<p>I hope the GOP will eventually realize that in order to stay in office, it is necessary to get their white, conservative base to come out and vote for them; and in order for their white, conservative base to come out and vote for them, they will need to feel like they&rsquo;re represented.</p>

		<p>So the GOP sees an opportunity with White voters?  What are they going to do?  Parade a few more neocons like John McCain and Lyndsey Graham into the spotlight?  Maybe make some media hype over a new colored &#8220;Republican&#8221; they&rsquo;ve found?  Throw that loser Alan Keyes into one of those races to guarantee defeat?  Do they think the White electorate is desperate enough to put anyone in office that&rsquo;s not a Democrat?  Do you think we were impressed by the dozen or so Republicans that voted to confirm SotoMayer?  Not this former Republican.  In fact, I will be voting third party until the RNC gives itself a much needed enema and flushes out all the RINOS and forces Michael Steele off the Chairmanship.  This is just for starters.  </p>

		<p>The Republicans have nothing to offer me.  They just let Sotomayor sashay into the Supreme Court.  Look what the Dems did to Bork and Thomas - the Republicans are cowards.  They support affirmative action, mass immigration of both types, the dispossession of whites, refuse to support official English, refuse to protect our border, support needless wars, support a military that deliberately puts whites disproportionately in harms way so that whites are the bulk of causalities.  The Republicans are Dem-lite.  They sicken me.</p>

<p>No, I sincerely believe the GOP will not learn a thing&hellip;as you already noted, they never do! These are the same people who still agitatge for more middle-eastern wars(Iran, etc.), who pander relentlessly to Hispanics who wouldn&rsquo;t even be here if they(the GOP) had stepped up and put a stop to the brown tidal-wave years ago, who continue to believe Blacks are really closet-conservatives just yearning to be the fine, upstanding citizens they really are, etc! No they won&rsquo;t learn a thing from this &#8220;teachable moment.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>As I told a large AfricanAmerican group before the Election, the demagraphic shift has already occured; the GOP&rsquo;s only strategy is to hope that Blacks don&rsquo;t show up or that the vote is suppressed somehow.  Victory is simply there for the taking.  Increasingly, every tactic is countered with a new, improved, and more impervious Black electorate.  In a back-handed way, they&rsquo;re actually doing Blacks a favor.</p>

		<p>Post #2 John PM, as always John has asked the most relevant question where the stupid party is concerned. My input for what it&rsquo;s worth John, is that the Republicans will not change. The 1994 advantage they had and squandered will be repeated. They will never play their strongest suite, the white voter and we may as well be open about it, since the Democrats openly chide them about it. I could give the reason why I feel they won&rsquo;t change, but many of the posters on this forum are politically sharper than I am, and it isn&rsquo;t neccessary. They know why?</p>

		<p>America seems to be destined to be ruled by blacks or mexicans. your political system is a dysaster, it is all about pandering more and more to minorities and from now on, it will be racist to vote a white president or other white candidate.<br>
This where it came to, all networks call republicans old white males, they made it sound like nazis.<br>
You are in a psychological trap, will you find a way out?<br>
Personally, I don&rsquo;t see any way out. <br>

		<p>In 1988 Bush Sr was in a tight race with Dukakis. </p>
<p>Some independent Bush supporters then ran a Willie Horton commercial explaining how Dukakis had allowed this convicted murderer (he stabbed a gas station clerk 19 times and dump the body in the trash) out on a prison furlough.  During the furlough Horton committed armed robbery, rape, another stabbing, and a car-jacking.  </p>
<p>Bush surged in the polls and Dukakis never regained political traction.  Two things come to mind: Dukakis didn&rsquo;t dispute the facts, and he even admitted he was aware of the furlough program and supportted it.  Bush claimed he had nothing to do with the ad after Jesse Jackson called the ad racist (Jackson also did not dispute the facts, he just called it racist).  </p>
<p>So here you have lunacy.  Bush is meekly denying his support of and extremely effective ad and Dukakis is supporting a furlough program but complains Bush should not be telling people about it.  Bush should have responded with, &#8220;hell yeah I support the ad.  The people need to know what Dukakis did.&#8221;</p>
<p>The GOP needs more factual commercials like Willie Horton.  When the Democrats create a program to build section 8 housing in the middle of a white-working-class neighborhood, the GOP needs to respond with commercials telling people about it.  When the Democrats create another Affirmative Action program denying whites promotions, the GOP needs to run commercials stating the facts.  The GOP needs to shine the light on the Democrats instead of trying to play second fiddle to the Democrats.</p>

<p>The Willie Horton ad was Lee Atwater&rsquo;s doing.  Atwater was a brilliant strategist, but he used his talents to get a near-plutocrat in the person of George H.W. Bush to win the Republican nomination over several better candidates (hint:  NOT Bob Dole), and then over Dukakis in the General.  Bush 41 bought us the H-1B visa program.  And Bush 41 bought us Bush 43, with all the immigration pandering and subprime mortgages begetting the financial crisis.</p>
<p>On top of that, Atwater wanted to be on the board of Howard University.  FGS, Why?</p>

		<p>After handling Obama with kid gloves in 2008 perhaps the GOP will come out swinging in 2010 and 2012.  Well, at least the GOP&rsquo;s base is hopping mad now, and more than a few independent voters that voted for Obama have seen the error of their ways.</p>
<p>So will the GOP take advantage of the Obama disaster??  Only if the GOP first cleans house and kicks out the pseudo conservatives and fills its ranks with people who want to fight and win (and do not care if they are accepted by the &#8220;Establishment&#8221;). </p>
<p>The GOP should not waste a dollar to attract black voters as that has proved futile time and time again.  Instead, the GOP should energize its white base that will actually vote for Republican candidates!!!</p>

		<p>We are stuck with two horrible parties.  The leadership of both favor illegal immigration, mass immigration, and anti-white discrimination.  The Democrats are most in favor of those things, but the Republicans never really oppose the Democrats on those issues.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that most Republicans favor stupid wars even more than the Democrats do, and what reason do I have to vote for them?</p>
<p>There was one Presidential candidate who really stood out.  Who tells the truth.  Who can&rsquo;t be bought - lobbyists don&rsquo;t even bother showing up at his door.  Who opposes war and insists upon fiscal responsibility and Constitutional government.  Who is against illegal immigration and affirmative action.  Who, unlike Hillary Clinton, voted against the Iraq war and the Orwellian named Patriot Act.  So what happened?  The Republican party rose as one and rejected Ron Paul.  The party operatives did everything they could to prevent Ron Paul delegates from even attending the convention.  Ultimately the Republicans put up a candidate who was simply a half senile clone of George W. Bush.  After the all too predictable rout, the party leaders asked themselves where they went wrong.  Their conclusion was that they had to be more like the Democrats on things like affirmative action and immigration.  The idea that the Iraq War doomed the Republican Party never crossed their minds.  The party has a death wish.</p>
<p>The only rational thing to do is to stay home, or vote for third party candidates as a protest vote (they&rsquo;ll never win).<br>

		<p>Black Insurgent, you do realize it was White voters that put Obama in the White House?  White voters who are 74 percent of the electorate versus 11 percent for blacks?  In a national election the black vote is statistically meaningless against the larger White vote.  Even the liberals will only allow blacks so much room on their leash before they jerk it back.  </p>

		<p>What the GOP needs, is to downplay any appearance of racism! While capitalizing on the outrage so many Whites feel or are starting to feel over the invasion of illegal immigrants. People our taxpayers being forced to support   &mdash;   at a cost of $80 to $100 BILLION a year!</p>
<p>Afro-Americans are adversely impacted particularly hard by the hordes of illegals from Mexico. Who have done an excellent job of shoving Blacks out of low-end manual labor jobs. Granted that many Blacks WELCOME a legitimate excuse to sit back and live off welfare checks, there are still some sensible-minded Blacks with enough intelligence to understand their future would be bleak, should Mexicans and their offspring gain political power.</p>
<p>The GOP needs to rethink its position. Remind Blacks that their friends are White Americans. That Hispanics cannot and will never be real allies to the Black cause.</p>

		<p>The Republican party is irrelevant for white conservative/capitalists.  Mainstream Republicans are too stupid to understand that they can never out pander the Democrat party as far as minorities are concerned.  With very few exceptions, media Republican talking heads (Bennett, Limbaugh, Hannity et al) are unwilling or afraid to explicitly confront the race issue.  </p>
<p>Also, on a somewhat related issue, most of the above so-called conservative commentators are more or less comfortable with our insane foreign policy.  Think about it: whites can&rsquo;t even walk safely in Detroit, but we&rsquo;re somehow supposed to &#8220;win the hearts and minds&#8221; of Afghanistan Muslim rebels?  Does that make sense to anyone?  No, the Republicans are worthless as a functional party.</p>

		<p>I have no use for either of the two parties. They are one and the same. Voting will NOT get us out of this mess. The nonwhites and the cowardly Whites will always vote in some minority when given a choice. Did we not see that with Obama and Sotomayer? The GOP has Michael Steele now and he is a disaster. Listening to these neocon talk show hosts leaves one even more depressed.</p>
<p> Has anyone else noticed how fearful they are to talk honestly about race? Has anyone noticed that they will not defend the White race? Has anyone noticed how they pervert what the Founders meant? A multicult society? A nation built for everyone in the world to flee to? Hardly.</p>
<p> Freedom of religion to these morons means ALL religions should be welcomed and accepted? How about them always taking credit for the Civil Rights movement and desegregation? That is to be applauded?  Hardly. That was our nation killer. They must think we are really stupid to buy into their own racial insanity. </p>
<p>Oh, and the granddaddy of them all. It was the Republicans who freed the slaves and left them here on our soil and they are proud of that?  </p>

		<p>Speaking as a former Reagan Republican, I can&rsquo;t believe that anyone would be dumb enough to vote for the Republicans again after their performance over the past eight years, but I guess anything is possible these days. If people don&rsquo;t have any attention span or historical memory, they can&rsquo;t learn from experience and tend to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. In this kind of climate, actions don&rsquo;t really have any consequences for our ruling elites. It used to be that politicians could survive almost anything unless they got caught in bed with &#8220;a dead woman or a live sheep,&#8221; as the saying goes, but these days, I&rsquo;m not even sure that would matter. After all, G.W. Bush got reelected after lying the country into Iraq  &mdash;  absolute proof, in my opinion, that fifty percent of the American population is beyond salvation. Personally, I would never consider voting for or supporting the Republicans in any way unless they (1) carried out a massive purge of the neoconservatives who took over the party; (2) stopped their idiotic racial pandering, and (3) showed some signs of actually having some principles again. None of that&rsquo;s likely to happen, of course, and I&rsquo;m not really sure what the Republicans could do to restore their credibility at this point, but none of that really matters. In the real world, actions do have consequences and the country is rapidly collapsing, assuming that it hasn&rsquo;t collapsed already. Everything that we are seeing now is just a kind of surrealistic sideshow. I mean, what difference does it make who is sitting in the captains seat while the ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean?<br>

&#8220;As I told a large AfricanAmerican group before the Election, the demagraphic shift has already occured; the GOP&rsquo;s only strategy is to hope that Blacks don&rsquo;t show up or that the vote is suppressed somehow. Victory is simply there for the taking. Increasingly, every tactic is countered with a new, improved, and more impervious Black electorate. In a back-handed way, they&rsquo;re actually doing Blacks a favor.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you spoke to the &#8220;large African American group,&#8221; I hope you expressed yourself a lot better than you did in the above post, because it&rsquo;s so poorly written it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Blacks are but a minute part of the electorate in this country, and what you had better realize is that if the racist mulatto, Obama, continues with his alienation of white citizens he could very well be impeached.  A white demographic shift HAS ALREADY OCCURRED.  It will get more powerful with each passing day.</p>
<p>The groups you see out there now are the beginning, and, if this dimwitted president has even a bit of sense he better not reduce his white base any further than what it is right now or he&rsquo;s going to be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no danger of violent clashes right now, but I&rsquo;m looking for the mentally challenged mulatto to screw up and continue to aggravate the white population who comprise some Democrats, and a LOT of Independents and a fair number of Republicans. Consevatives, libertarians, constitutionalists, and Independents amount to about 80% of the electorate right now.  Liberals are just 20%.</p>
<p>Look for the messiah to continue to anger whites until the black population stupidly tries to protect him by going up against white protestors.</p>
<p>It will be at that time the beginning of the next civil war be underway.</p>
<p>And the Hispanic population?  Blacks and Hispanics are having a civil war all their own in California and sporadically in other states, so don&rsquo;t think you have all people of color under one umbrella.  Blacks alienate so many other people no other race wants anything to do with them.  </p>
<p>You put WAAAY too much emphasis on the power of this totalitarian thug now in office.  He was put there by whites.  He can also be removed by whites.  Since blacks comprise just 12% of the population, they would be next to useless in the larger scheme of things.</p>
<p>You are afflicted with a common malady among blacks known as baseless arrogance. <br>

<p>We might see another white male president, maybe a couple of them, but in general I think you&rsquo;re right. Dick &#8220;Toe Sucker&#8221; Morris, Clinton&rsquo;s former campaign manager, made the same prediction several years ago. The Republicans, in particular, have had it, but they won&rsquo;t just vanish overnight. They&rsquo;ll keep floundering around, &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to blacks and Hispanics  &mdash;  anything to avoid taking a stand on real principles  &mdash;  but no matter what they do, the demographics have either reached the tipping point already or they will in the next few years. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s any exaggeration to say that the party&rsquo;s over for the white majority, not to mention the US as a white western country. We don&rsquo;t have to wait until we&rsquo;re an absolute numerical minority before we&rsquo;re disenfranchised. For all practical purposes, it&rsquo;s already happened. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over for the so-called &#8220;white nationalist movement&#8221; as well, at least politically. Individual whites can still benefit from racial consciousness, but this non-existent movement has had zero effect on anything that&rsquo;s been happening on a national scale. White Nationalism is like a doctor who knows who how to diagnose illness, but doesn&rsquo;t have a clue how to treat it.</p>

		<p>By the next election the Gates affair will be forgotten.  Even if something similiar occurs in September 2012, the Republicans would never take advantage of it.</p>
<p>The Republicans are as anti White as the Democrats.  Never forget that the worst ravages of affirmative action occurred between 1967 and 1974, most of that time  Nixon was President.  It was not all racist anti White Judges.  The real damage was done by Nixon&rsquo;s EEOC and Justice Department.</p>
<p>Those of us old enough to have voted for Ronald Reagan as the great White hope were greatly disappointed when affirmative action went on its destructive way during his administration.  </p>
<p>It was Reagan who eliminated simple reading conprehension and math testing for applicants to federal positions requiring Bachelor&rsquo;s, Masters and Doctoral degrees.</p>
<p>It seemed that blacks with their affirmative action BAs, MAs and PHDs could not demonstrate basic 12 grade reading and writing and 10th grade math skills so Reagan and Clarence Thomas eliminated that exam, the PACE or Professional Administrative Careers Exam.</p>
<p>Some federal agencies were allowed to keep their tried and proven aptitude tests, such as the FBI, CIA, DEA and State Department, but blacks were given as much as 50 points out of a total score of 100 to make sure they &#8220;passed.&#8221;  Meanwhile as much as 50 points were subtracted from the scores of Whites.</p>
<p>Always, always remember, the Republicans hate us as much as do the Democrats.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest here.  The demOgraphic shift, if and when it actually does occur, will not be favorable nor kind to blacks.  There are about 40 black Congressmen, many of them representing shaky districts where the hispanic population is outpacing the African one.  It stands to reason that as these people gain political capitol, they will replace them with their own or vote for White candidates.  The political landscape over the next years will have diminishing representation for blacks and it will continue indefinitely because the hispanic population growth will dwarf the black population.  The black upper and middle class is built on sand, dependent on cushy affirmative action government jobs for sustenance.  Even if hispanics only get half of these quotas (they outnumber blacks so this is just a conservative estimate), it will plunge millions of blacks into poverty.  There is already alot of friction between blacks and hispanics and that will only increase in the future as you fight for your share of resources.     </p>

When you add in the fact that today&rsquo;s media elite are effectively in charge of the modern election campaign, you begin to see the hopelessness of getting another Reagan into position.  Voters have to lose hope before they can gain hope.  In that sense, Obama is going to be a catalyst for the kind of change he never expected.  Just sit back, be patient, and watch&hellip;</p>

		<p>American Whites must safeguard their majority and dominance of the country&rsquo;s culture   &mdash;  - THEIR traditional culture   &mdash;  - while this is still possible. This means abolishing all foreign languages and PC from official public-domain business, phasing out affirmative action, re-introducing the Melting Potideals full force in our schools and public arena. Also leaning hard on legislators of both parties, at the federal and state levels, and showing up for town hall and municipal meetings, more or less continually. States where patriots can sway policies, should resist DC collectivist/New World Order blackmail and counter with secession threats. When we take DC back   &mdash;  - and before that, at the state level wherever possible   &mdash;  -we should take steps to criminalize municipal officials that have created &#8216;sanctuary cities&rsquo; for illegals. Highway patrol and other local police   &mdash;  - and perhaps even National Guard   &mdash;  - should be used, in addition to ICE, to apprehend suspected illegals and terrorists, based on various criteria including profiling. DHS shoudl, if not abolished, used for its intended purpose   &mdash;  - monitoring and rounding up suspect Middle Eastern and other foreign or foreign-brainwashed terrorist   &mdash;  - and NOT to spy on Conservative-minded Americans at the behest of our present DC Occupation Government. Professors at publicly funded colleges who engage in anti-Western and overzealous multiculti propaganda, or who stifle or intimidate ordinary American students from expressing their views, should be fired after due deliberations, and the citizenry should hold school boards accountable in a similar vein regarding K-12 school teachers (not to mention that people of higher quality should be hired). All people in the country illegally should be rounded up and deported, although exceptions can be made for those of European descent who are deemed good candidates to be Americans. The federal government should take aggressive control of our national borders   &mdash;  - that is after all THE main reason it exists   &mdash;  - and until they do, I would not rule out letting National Guard troops do this   &mdash;  - not just along the Mexican border, but in some cases also along interstate crossings. Immigration laws should be restored to pre-1965 National Origins quotas favoring Europe and parts thereof (or Australia/NZ &amp; Canada)   &mdash;   with modifications to ensure that these are really old-time Europeans, not (say) Middle Eastern<br>
or African immigrants to European-founded countries of origin.  The exams for new immigrants should be expanded to ensure they understand our system of government and do not adhere to sick EU/leftist types of ideas on social engineering. We should not engage in &#8216;nation building&rsquo;, nor NAFTA/Globalization type of economic policies, though of course the US must look after its interests abroad (economic and geo-political) and ensure no rogue nation has the ability to lob missiles at us. The cazy policies of the Kenyan Socialist&rsquo;s regime   &mdash;   of sabotaging our economy for some unproven science, and befriending tin-pot dictators and and assortment of anti-West regimes   &mdash;  - should end. We should encourage right-wing parties in Europe, Canada and down-under to follow similar policies to those we will.</p>
<p>These are some of the ways we can save our nation and civilization. And if the GOP won&rsquo;t do the job we must create a nationalist party that will. </p>

<p>The general comments about the impending demise of the GOP are accurate. There is virtually no difference between the parties nowadays.

Obama came out of nowhere, from absolute obscurity to sprinkling the nation with magic dust in a total of 3 years.

		<p>It&rsquo;s clear to me that the rise of a third party is the only path by which traditional Americans can shed themselves of the unending abuse and betrayal of the currently entrenched two-party tyranny.</p>
<p>It could happen like this: An increasing number of voters would have to dedicate themselves to vote, election after election, for a losing new party effort until accruing enough committed voters to ultimately win. This would require a concise party platform appealing to the majority, one which never changed until hunger for the promise of that platform spread to a majority of voters.</p>
<p>This would mean a lot of people willing to vote idealistically, instead of selfishly, egocentrically, impulsively, or out of superficial habit, over a long period. </p>
<p>After thirty years of toxic leftist anti-American establishment media, and university mis-education throughout the U.S., growing a winning and genuinely American third party offers a slim chance - but it is the only possible salvation remaining.   </p>

Like my father said during the election, &#8220;300 million people in this country and MCCAIN is the best person they could find to run, hell I can find better at the local diner that I go have breakfast at.&#8221; The GOP has been dying a slow death for a long time now but, in my opinion, George Bush put the final nail in the coffen for me. We desparatly need a 3rd party in this country along the lines of the BNP in Great Britain.   </p>

		<p>The Republican party has many problems and one big problem the size of Toledo&hellip;the neo-conservative oligarchy that controls it. Talk about whites betraying whites. It&rsquo;s not that they want to oppose the revolution. They are the revolution. They control the money, screen the national candidates, decide what issues are important and have most of talk radio and the blogosphere in their grip. In terms of all the stuff between the ears and in the American heart, their job is simple to insure that it never sees the light of day in a political context.<br>
Even been to a Republican (suburban) caucus ? They may as well be converted to gardening clubs because that would be more productive.<br>
Therefor the Republican Party should rename itself: The European American Extinction Party. Because that is what they have been doing since 4 Score Abe broke the dam and the poison of internationalism swept across the land. <br>
I have a very even disposition&hellip;I&rsquo;m mad all the time. </p>

		<p>The Republican party is irrelevant for white conservative/capitalists.</p>
<p>MP - The Republican party may be irrelevant for white conservatives but it has always been the party of capitalism.</p>
<p>Capitalists do not care about kin or country, they care about MONEY. They have always been for the cheapest labor possible. Every wave of immigration has been due to capitalists using immigration to break the labor movements of the time and drive wages down. The fact that they used Eastern Europeans and the Irish before doesn&rsquo;t mean they weren&rsquo;t brought in for the same reason as they are bringing the Mexicans in now.</p>
<p>Pure capitalism will destroy a country just as surely as pure socialism can, you might want to look up the conditions in coal mines in America as late as the 1970&rsquo;s to see capitalism the way capitalists wanted it. It was even worse in the days of the company store and company script for pay.</p>

		<p>As usual, all that we are witnessing is the result of decades of careful brainwashing from the Marxist controlled media, universities and schools. <br>
This is called Psychological Warfare and it has all but defeated America from within. <br>
The most critical counter attack must be to convince Americans that they have been lied to by the media and schools which are continuing to lie to them. <br>
The media directly controls the thoughts and actions of something like 30 to 50 million Americans, the ones who in polls say they get their &#8220;news&#8221; from CBS, ABC, NBC, etc. <br>
The Republican party is dead. Brain dead. They are dinosaurs which have become extinct. They have no ability to formulate an aggressive attack plan to take back the country or to communicate it. Their communication skills rank right up there with a fence post. <br>
The proof of Republican brainlessness is in their recent confirmation of Sotomayor. She is a racist, Marxist, hate America infiltrator and they actually couldn&rsquo;t see a reason not to confirm her, even with Videos on Youtube.com where she expressed her utter contempt for the Constitutional Foundations of our Judiciary. <br>
We need a new generation of smart, creative, aggressive, take no prisoners leaders who understand what is really happening and how to fight it. <br>
As always, Darwin rules. How humiliating to lose to the libs. </p>

		<p>I agree with Poster no. 40 that in a post-racial society that there would be no set asides for blacks, that black incompetents would be fired from public and private sector jobs, and that the kid-glove treatment law enforcement currently needs to take with blacks would come to an end. Instead, we have bizarre claims that the system of racial preferences that skew things in the favor of the black man is still not enough, and that even more needs to be done on their behalf.</p>

<p>A reasonable proposition.</p>
<p>Mediocre GOP presidential candidates   &mdash;  - like Bush II, McCain, Bush I, and Bob Dole   &mdash;  - are high probability outcomes of a dysfunctional GOP presidential primary process. </p>
<p>The problem is &#8220;front-loading&#8221; (winner-take-all, rather the proportional, voting in early primary states) AND openness to independent voting (which gives leftwing partisans opportunity for mischief: either to boost the chances of their preferred loser or defeat a feared candidate).</p>

		<p>&#8220;BTW the poster who said Lincoln was shot before he could deport all Blacks to Liberia is not really factual. They admitted they did not have the $$$ to do that to begin with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s &#8220;plan&#8221; to send all the blacks to Liberia was nothing more than a campaign promise for his November 1864 re-election.  The Northern workers did not want a vast influx of blacks who would compete with native White Americans and millions of immigrants in the labor market.</p>
<p>Lincoln needed the votes of the native White American workers to win the election.  Therefore he made that promise.</p>
<p>Had he lived do you think that the yankees who went south for reconstruction would have allowed, their designated victim group, the blacks who were their reason for being in the south to be sent off to Africa? It would mean no jobs and no money for the carpetbaggers.  Then all those abolitionist women.  They needed their designated victim group the blacks.</p>
<p>Of course the wealthy southerners needed their cheap black labor which was even cheaper after slavery ended and the employer no longer needed to furnish food, shelter, clothing and other necessities of life.</p>
<p>And the northern capitalist and industrialists who brought in millions of European immigrants every year rejoiced at the newly avaliable source of cheap labor and strike breakers, southern blacks who could be brought north to add to the cheap labor pool and bring down wages.</p>
<p>And of course the blacks, unlike many of the immigrants spoke english.  Cheap as the immigrants and speaking English, the northern capitalists looked forward to the immigration of blacks from south to north.  Of course the wives looked forward to cheaper and cheaper domestic help.</p>
<p>Whatever Lincoln intended is irrevelant.  The capitalists would never have allowed millions of cheap labor blacks to be sent off to Africa. A lot of black historians conclude that the whole purpose of the civil war was to take the blacks from their southern slave owners and transport them north as cheap labor to bring down wages for all workers.  This theory makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Also, how could it have been done?  Once they were freed, blacks had the same rights as whites.  There were a lot of civil rights lawyers around, particularly in abolitionist New England.  Would Judges have ruled that people who had been in this country for 200 years and wanted to stay must be deported against their will?</p>
<p>Linoln never intended it to happen.  It was an empty campaign promise. <br>

Mark is so right. Some continue to vote Republican time after time, and never lose their hope, despite all the betrayals. Will they never learn?  </p>
<p>As others have said above, the media are in charge and shape the country&rsquo;s opinions.  If you want to know who controls the Republican party and calls the Republican tune, look at who funds it. Money talks.   Take a good look!  You might be surprised: the same people who fund the Democrats.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re already greasing the spokes to get the public to accept Sarah Palin as the new Presidential candidate for 2012.  All this bad publicity is an attempt to get people to rally to her out of sympathy.  It appears Bobby Jindal has crashed and burned.  Make no mistake, this woman is neocon lite.  She may have socially conservative values but the rest of her ideology matches John McCain&rsquo;s.  </p>

Anonymous:  [Your&rsquo;re obviously not the intelligent &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; whom I respect greatly;  I shall call have to call you &#8220;Other Anonymous&#8221;]    &mdash;    Your own suspicions of  &#8220;propaganda plants&#8221;  convey the odor of slight paranoia.

<p>Do they represent YOU and YOUR interests? Do they care about YOU and your people?   </p>
<p>No one here on Amen has to be a left-wing plant against the Republicans. Why  would anyone go to the trouble, when the party itself is so riddled with them, and actually controlled by them?   The thing is, most Republicans are so dense that they wouldn&rsquo;t even recognize a Marxist or a  &#8220;left-wing plant&#8221; if they bumped face-on into one. That&rsquo;s why they continue to vote for what they foolishly  think are &#8220;conservatives&#8221;.   And why they continue to be bitterly disappointed.</p>
<p>One grudging thing I can say about the Dems:  they are at least a little more open about their objectives. Not very much, true, but at least relatively more open than the Reps. That&rsquo;s not meant to be a compliment, btw.   As someone said above, they&rsquo;re just two different roads leading to the same cliff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beloved GOP&#8221;? Not beloved by me. The GOP is a disaster.  The Bush years did enormous damage to the nation.  But as a potential vehicle for supporting a conservative political agenda, the GOP is the ONLY game in town.</p>
<p>Third party fantasies   &mdash;  - whether promoted by leftwing plants on this board or by the genuinely gullible   &mdash;  - serve only the political left.  That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s worth leftwinger&rsquo;s efforts to steer the foolish and the naive into these political blind alleys.</p>
<p>Yes, reach-across-the-aisle John McCain, Lindsey Graham, George Bush, etc. are Republicans, but NOT the Republican Party.  Ron Paul is a Republican.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason Ron Paul belongs to the Stupid Party, whose stupidity he constantly exposes. Try to figure out what Paul&rsquo;s reason might be.</p>

<p>I respect your position but the other guy has a point.  You can get all the Democratic Senators to vote for the stimulus bill but you can&rsquo;t get all Republicans to vote against Soto-Mayer?  It feels like one big charade is being played on us and they nominated Michael Steele to the RNC as a slap in the face to us.  I was listening to a town hall being held on the radio today and some woman asked the Republican Congressman how illegal immigrants were destroying TN and he went on with the usual enforcement blah blah blah and then he said TN wants to become a melting pot but these people need to come through legal channels.  If these same people managed to come to the US on a visa the same problems we had when they came here illegally wouldn&rsquo;t change.  How is that going to fix the schools?  How is that enforcing English as the main language?  Republicans aren&rsquo;t going to win very many elections without us but they don&rsquo;t seem to care.  It&rsquo;s still business as usual with them.  The next time they throw another big soiree in DC they&rsquo;ll just get together with their paymasters and decide on how to vote on upcoming legislation.  So many Dems vote this way and so many Repubs vote this way.  It&rsquo;s all a stupid game.  <br>
