<h1>Is Racial Profiling Racist?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Walter Williams, A Minority View, August 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}We can think of profiling in general as a practice where people use an observable or known physical attribute as a proxy or estimator of some other unobservable or unknown attribute. Race or sex profiling is simply the use of race or sex as that estimator. Profiling represents mankind&rsquo;s attempt to cope with information cost. {snip}</p>
<p>People differ by race and sex. Let&rsquo;s look at a few profiling examples to see which ones you&rsquo;d like outlawed. According to the American Cancer Society, the lifetime risk of men getting breast cancer is about 1/10th of 1 percent, or 1 in 1,000; and 440 men will die of breast cancer this year. For women, the risk of developing breast cancer is about 12 percent, or 1 in 8, and 40,610 will die from it this year. Should doctors and medical insurance companies be prosecuted for the discriminatory practice of routine breast cancer screening for women but not for men?</p>
<p>Some racial and ethnic groups have higher incidence and mortality from various diseases than the national average. The rates of death from cardiovascular diseases are about 30 percent higher among black adults than among white adults. Cervical cancer rates are five times higher among Vietnamese women in the U.S. than among white women. Pima Indians of Arizona have the highest known diabetes rates in the world. Prostate cancer is nearly twice as common among black men as white men.</p>
<p>Knowing patient race or ethnicity, what might be considered as racial profiling, can assist medical providers in the delivery of more effective medical services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a 1999 article, &#8220;Capital Cabbies Salute Race Profiling,&#8221; James Owens writes, &#8220;If racial profiling is racism, then the cab drivers of Washington, D.C., they themselves mainly blacks and Hispanics, are all for it. A District taxicab commissioner, Sandra Seegars, who is black, issued a safety-advice statement urging D.C.&rsquo;s 6,800 cabbies to refuse to pick up &#8216;dangerous looking&rsquo; passengers. She described &#8216;dangerous looking&rsquo; as a young black guy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with shirttail hanging down longer than his coat, baggy pants, unlaced tennis shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pizza Marketing Quarterly carried a story of charges of racial discrimination filed in St. Louis against Papa John&rsquo;s pizza delivery services. Papa John&rsquo;s district manager said she could not and would not ask her drivers to put their lives on the line. She added that the racial discrimination accusation is false because 75 to 85 percent of the drivers in the complaining neighborhood are black and, moreover, most of those drivers lived in the very neighborhood being denied delivery service.</p>
<p>Some years ago, the Rev. Jesse Jackson complained, &#8220;There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery  &mdash;  then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my question: Is the racial profiling done by cab drivers, pizza deliverers or Jesse Jackson a sign of racism or economizing on information costs?<br>

		<p>RandyB, I have nothing against Walt Williams and his article is excellent.  However, I feel I must point out that a person can have absolutely correct opinions about various issues, write about them eloquently - but still be an animal inside.  So Mr. Williams ability to write persuasively does not automatically mean that he would make a good neighbor.  Many preachers (and politicians) have spoken forcefully against sexual vice - only to be caught in their own petard later on.</p>

		<p>Another, when a Black says it, is okay and good, but if a White man says it all hell breaks loose. Wondering if this is a deliberate ruse to make Whites think, &#8220;see how great many blacks are and they are even on our side&#8221;&hellip;.Whites are taken in easily and that is their main problem.</p>

Deliberate ruse??  No way.  I&rsquo;ve read his columns for years, they&rsquo;re always good.  IMHO, he comes across as a level-headed, intelligent, and decent human being. </p>

		<p>I am no liberal but in fairness to Dr. Williams there are many blacks who would love to live the &#8220;white bread&#8221; lifestyle.  Unfortunately they are a tiny minority of blacks.  And, like our President, the only blacks who get elected are the racists or the &#8220;government must do more for our people&#8221; types.  Once mean old whitey is gone the problems of the black community will persist because they are their own worst enemy.  Most blacks, like our President, would rather hate whitey than address the social ills of their own people.</p>

		<p>Should cops be the only ones charged with this bogus race profiling? What about black on white criminal racial profiling? Is it racial profiling when whites are beaten raped murdered assaulted robbed home invaded 3 million times annually or at least thats whats reported since afterall the black perpetrators are fully aware they are committing violence against the caucasoid race? Is it not racial profiling when they break into white homes to steal loot and pillage or rob white businesses while assaulting or killing the white attendants or raping white females? <br>
We need to hear more about the deliberate wanton intentional acts of criminal violence aka racial profiling by black criminals against white victims that is always ignored.</p>

		<p>No. In my opinion racial, profiling is not racism. it is realism because the police know who is causing most of the crime these days and it&rsquo;s definitely not little old ladies using walkers.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve met and spoken to Walter Williams on several occasions and he is not at all a black racist. Aside from being a brilliant economist he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humor. He&rsquo;s not a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, he&rsquo;s the real deal and not afraid to speak the truth. He&rsquo;s a good man.</p>

		<p>Just five minutes ago I read in our local newspaper that a store had been burglarized last night. The loot taken was 1. Marlboro Cigs 2. NEWPORT Cigs 3. Swisher Sweet Cigars. Hmmmmm I wonder who did it? I know by the items they wanted BUT I can&rsquo;t say because I might be accused of Racial Profiling?</p>

<p>Why, do you want their kids to grow up and marry your children?  Unless these condescending blacks also believe in allowing and encouraging true diversification (racial and ethnic groups that are encouraged to exist interminably, not temporarily), they are just nerdy blacks who have found a more sophisticated way into the white man&rsquo;s bedroom.<br>

		<p>I believe that Dr. Williams is a good man. He is even bold enough to quote things such as:</p>
<p>&#8220;Criminologist Marvin Wolfgang says, `For four violent offenses   &mdash;   homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault   &mdash;   the crime rates for blacks are at least 10 times as high as they are for whites.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Which suggest that Williams might believe in a genetic influence on intelligence and character.</p>
<p>Now, that poses a question that I have always wanted to ask individualistic libertarian types such as Dr. Williams, Dr. Sowell and Dr. Ron Paul: If you recognize and accept that genetics is so important, how do you expect society to survive as the quality of the average person continues to degrade from immigration, non-White birth rates, etc.? Furthermore, very few of these new immigrants are capable of sharing in libertarian ideals. I don&rsquo;t see many Mexicans supporting Ron Paul.  </p>
<p>And if their answer involves things like private enclaves, do they consider the costs and long term viability of this approach? Isn&rsquo;t being able to walk safely on uncrowded land in, say, the 1950&rsquo;s U.S. worth a great deal in itself and is necessary to give rise to our happiest, brightest and best educated people? If the whole world becomes one great third world slum, do they really expect great scientists, economists, etc., to somehow magically rise out of it and obtain a good quality of life without having a first world White Western country to flee to? </p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t libertarianism demonstrate that it can fix the likes of Haiti before they put so much faith in either libertarianism or immigrants from the third world?</p>

		<p>And if the libertarians can *not*, in their heart-of-hearts, accept the truth of the relationship between genetics, intelligence, race and culture, do they really subscribe to the absurd secular libertarian/liberal position that - as Sam Dickson has said - only one organ (the brain) in one species (humans) &#8220;in all of creation has been specially exempted from the laws of evolution and heredity &hellip; by non-God&#8221;?</p>
<p>In other words, to admit that Blacks may suffer from higher rates of heart disease owing to genetics, but not to accept that such differences might also apply to the brain, without appeal to massive divine intervention, (not to even mention all the current evidence to the contrary) is ludicrous.</p>
<p>So, I would like to know what ails our libertarian types.</p>
<p>Given the results we have seen so far, and our inability to discuss racial issues frankly and openly, the only sane and prudent course of action is to shutdown all non-White immigration into White nations. Yet, libertarians are curiously silent on this issue.</p>
<p>Another strange event was that Dr. Williams and Dr. Sowell were either silent about or opposed to, respectively, Dr. Ron Paul during his presidential campaign, the one time in recent memory a viable (or at least seemed to be so for awhile) presidential contender shared most all of their ideology. <br>
