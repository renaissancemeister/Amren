			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wendy Koch, USA Today, August 3, 2009</i></p>

<p><b>&#8216;A perfect parent&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>While blacks account for 15% of U.S. children, they make up 32% of the 510,000 kids in foster care, according to a May 2008 report by the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, a private research group. The report is based on 2006 data, the latest available. It shows that black children in foster care, especially older ones, are less likely than white ones to be adopted.</p>
<p>To help deal with that imbalance, a federally funded ad campaign is to be unveiled today. It is aimed at encouraging blacks to adopt from the foster care system. The ads will appear this fall on radio, TV and in newspapers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 1994 federal law, the Multiethnic Placement Act, prohibits denying or delaying an adoption because of race but requires &#8220;diligent&#8221; efforts to recruit parents of the same race.</p>
<p>The new ads, developed by the Advertising Council, are part of a series that began in 2002 to promote adoption from foster care. {snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Some good news&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>After similar ads aired in Spanish, &#8220;we got so many calls, we couldn&rsquo;t handle them,&#8221; says Kathy Ledesma, project director of AdoptUsKids, a federally funded project that launched the ads.</p>
<p>Pertman says it makes sense to target blacks on behalf of black kids, because they are the most likely to adopt them, especially the older ones who are hardest to place. Single black women, often aunts or grandmothers, adopt nearly two-thirds of black foster kids, according to Penelope Maza, who analyzed foster care data for the federal Children&rsquo;s Bureau for nearly three decades until her retirement in December.</p>
<p>An increased effort to place black children with relatives before they enter foster care and to promote their adoption has helped to improve the imbalance, says Ruth McRoy, who researches adoption at the University of Texas-Austin.</p>
<p>In 1998, black children accounted for 43% of kids in the foster care system, but that share has since gone down, according to U.S. data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Donaldson report says one in five black foster kids are adopted by parents of a different race, and the majority of them are 4 years old or younger. It cites research showing that this kind of adoption can pose identity problems and recommends adoptive parents undergo training to help their kids.</p>
<p>New Yorker Sarah Gerstenzang, who is white, took in a black foster daughter when the girl was 5 weeks old and later adopted her. &#8220;I hear kids say to her, &#8216;That&rsquo;s your mom!&rsquo;&#8221; Gerstenzang says, adding that her daughter has learned to handle it.</p>

<p>Ms Gerstenzang is deluding herself about her daughter&rsquo;s [Handling] of it. As time goes by, the girl will have big time problems with this and she won&rsquo;t be looking too kindly on Ms Gerstenzang. I wouldn&rsquo;t blame the kid one bit either.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;New Yorker Sarah Gerstenzang, who is white, took in a black foster daughter when the girl was 5 weeks old and later adopted her&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It does seem that the latest fashion accessory among the gliterrati and wealthy is a non-White child a la Angelina Jolie and Madonna. Wonder when they&rsquo;ll tire of their latest toys  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m guessing when the accessories become unruly teenagers.</p>
<p>And this from the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It cites research showing that this kind of adoption (trans-racial) can pose identity problems and recommends adoptive parents undergo training to help their kids&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Did anyone in the courts recommend that Michael Jackon&rsquo;s mother undergo training after she was awarded custody of her late son&rsquo;s White children (well, at least two are White, I&rsquo;m not sure about Blanket)?</p>
<p>Will she be sensitive to their White identity and respect their White culture?</p>

Just yesterday, I saw a commerical with a retired white woman who was proud that she became a foster parent to black kids. They apparently taught her so much.</p>
<p>Blacks who are adopted by whites usually end up disappointed that they didn&rsquo;t get to grow up with the authentic &#8216;black experience&rsquo; and harbor anger and resentment toward the white parents.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope more blacks adopt black children. However, I think the burden of adopting black children is going to remain with whites.</p>

		<p>The kids are a million times better off being adopted by anybody, white black green, gay straight whatever than being in the horrible affirmative action foster care system which is run by disfunctional, useless black affirmative action women.</p>
<p>The situation is so bad that when the boys reach 18, the county hands them a referral to the homeless shelter.  Of course 40 years ago when merit system competent white women were in charge of the foster home system the girls all could type at least 40 words a minute before they were cut loose and the boys either fixed up with jobs or mentally and physically qualified for a military career.  Not too shabby.</p>
<p>But after 40 years of affirmative action black women running the system, the girls only hope is to have babies to get on welfare and the boys are referred to the homeless shelter.</p>
<p>And of course, it is unknown for black foster children to graduate from high school any more.</p>
<p>Affirmative action in action!!!!!</p>

		<p>So now 15% of children are black - and the black percentage of the population keeps creeping up.  Worse still is the fact that the only reason they are ONLY 15% is the growth of Hispanic and Asian populations.  Is it good that the percentage of blacks, in a country, keeps going up?  Given the host of pathologies that always accompanies large concentrations of blacks, the answer is &#8220;certainly not&#8221;.  Worse yet, it&rsquo;s whites who are paying for their own dispossession and nurturing the seeds of their own destruction.  But none of this bothers the central government.  Not at all.  Instead, their only priority is that those black children grow up feeling good about being black.  Meanwhile, that same government does everything in its power to make sure that white children grow up feeling bad about being white.  Who elected the government that is so perverted?  Why, white people of course.  And now those same white people are paying for a program to try to convince blacks to take care of their own!  Will the sickness never end?</p>

		<p>Perhaps instead of spending money to convince random black people to adopt black kids, we could try to convince black &#8220;parents&#8221; to raise their own kids. </p>
<p>Whoops, sorry, I know preaching personal responsibility is racist.    </p>

		<p>I wish we could create a kind of &#8220;civilian Army&#8221; (no guns) to target age 16-25 black males.  A lot of poor whites with nowhere else to go join the real Army (to their credit) and many come out prepared to act like men.   Kind of combine the Guardian Angels (police the ghettos, but unarmed), community college and Habitat for Humanity into a program when young black men would at least not be dealing drugs. </p>

<p>At least teach the Mothers to take care of black kids hair.  I&rsquo;m an extreme White nationalist but if I ever took in a black child I would take care of his or her hair, something I learned how to do a long time ago.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the supermarket line I see pictures of Heidi Klum and her black boys.  The kid&rsquo;s hair is about 8 inches long and stands straight up in a sort of fright wig arrangement.  And she is their real Mother.  Don&rsquo;t those boys have black relatives who could teach if not Heidi the nanny to take care of her sons hair?</p>

		<p>I wish there were a law that would make it an obligation for White people seeking to adopt children, to adopt White kids. So we would see no more of this Angelina Jolie tendancy to adopt colored kids to seem good or progressive or liberal&hellip; or whatever&hellip;</p>
<p>Are we soon going to see ads funded by the Obama administration, in which White people will be told that it is immoral, backward and racist, to adopt a White child fro, say, Eastern Europe???</p>
<p>I mean, with Handsome Barack, I&rsquo;m afraid just about anything is possible!</p>

		<p>I strongly disagree that blacks make up on 32% of children in foster care. I know in Georgia they make up closer to 65%. The only thing that keeps it from being even more is all the grandmas and aunts that take in their relatives&rsquo; children when the parent goes to jail.</p>

<p>Come on Bon, those kids have been raised in a black family since birth.  And since they inherited all his money and the vast sums that will be coming in after his death, I&rsquo;m sure they will be well treated. It must be weird though,since they are homeschooled as well as living in Jackson compounds.</p>
<p>Seeing them at the funeral, I noticed that their black caretakers know how to care for White hair.  That&rsquo;s better than about 99 percent of Whites who take in black children and let their hair grow wild.</p>
