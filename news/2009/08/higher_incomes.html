<h1>Higher Incomes Equal Higher Test Results: Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kyodo News, Aug. 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Elementary school students from high-income families scored notably higher than those from low-income families in last year&rsquo;s nationwide achievement exam, a government analysis of the results showed Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sixth-graders at public elementary schools whose parents earn ¥12 million or more scored 8 to 10 percentage points more than the national average in Japanese language and mathematics, while pupils from families with income of less than ¥2 million scored more than 10 percentage points less than the average.</p>
<p> A panel of experts under the Ministry of Education,  Culture, Sports, Science and Technology made the finding after conducting a survey on the parents of some of the elementary school pupils who took the standardized achievement exam, introduced by the ministry in 2007, revealing links between household income  and the exam results for the first time.</p>
<p>The survey found the largest gap, as much as 23.3 percentage points, in the ability to apply basic mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>The percentage of questions answered correctly by students with a family income of less than ¥2 million stood at 42.6 percent, while those with a family income of between ¥12 million and ¥15 million got 65.9 percent of the questions right. The national average was 55.8 percent.</p>
<p>Sixth-graders whose parents spend more than ¥50,000 a month on education other than school had 71.2 percent of the math questions right, compared with 44.4 percent among those whose parents spend none.</p>
<p>The panel concluded that the difference was a result of the income gap,  saying the more parents earn, the more they spend on child education, particularly cram schools.</p>
<p>Hiroaki Mimizuka, a professor specializing in educational sociology at Ochanomizu University  in Tokyo and a member of the panel, said the results point to the possibility that providing monetary assistance for education could improve students&rsquo; abilities.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s totally true that the Japanese and most other asian societies are in denial about the reality of intelligence differences.  Lots of people on these forums seem to dream of East Asia as a haven from all the liberal censorship of facts that has affected white countries, but in fact they&rsquo;re even worse than we are &hellip; they just don&rsquo;t have the same problems with race being linked to IQ.  </p>

		<p>1. Race is the same<br>
2.  Social customs of hard work accepted by all social classes<br>
3.  By high school, kids who don&rsquo;t work hard are in vocational schools,not in college-bound programs. Good idea for USA.</p>

The Japanese may be in denial about intelligence differences AMONG JAPANESE but this is typical Japanese chauvanism. They are certainly not insane enough to believe that Africans are on average as intelligent as Europeans and the only reason Africa is a god forsaken hellhole is because of the &#8220;legacy of colonialism.&#8221; A while back Prime Minister Nakasone made a comment about how Japan was free of the burden of &#8220;problematic minorities&#8221; and that American test scores were dragged down by minorities. He had to apologize but added that he was impressed that the USA managed to function in spite of the problems he pointed out. It is only white people who believe en mass that all of humanity is equal. Who lets millions of illiterate immigrants into their countries? Japan doesn&rsquo;t, even in the face of massive labor shortages. I think its time for whites to admit that their governments failed them while the Japanese state still cares about Japanese people. Its not something I celebrate, its something that puzzles me and most readers here, but its the truth. If a German politician said &#8220;Germany for Germans&#8221; he would be called a racist nazi etc etc. If a Japanese politician said anything OTHER than &#8220;Japan for the Japanese&#8221; he&rsquo;d be run out of town. </p>

		<p>To Anonymous no.4,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only white people who believe en mass that all of humanity is equal&rsquo;&hellip;&hellip;..oh please c&rsquo;mon, most white people do not think all humanity is equal. I&rsquo;m white and believe that whites are smarter and more civilised than others. Unfortunately in the West, students go through their jnr. and snr. years with a school curriculum full of constant indoctrination and lies. </p>
<p>&#8220;Who lets millions of illiterate immigrants into their countries? Japan doesn&rsquo;t, even in the face of massive labor shortages. I think its time for whites to admit that their governments failed them while the Japanese state still cares about Japanese people&#8221;.</p>
<p>I totally agree that our western Govts. have failed their white voters but the voters also have themselves to blame but there is hope by forming new political parties with Nationalist agendas. Traditional political parties in the West were against third world immigration and multiculturalism but things started to change in the mid 60&rsquo;s and early 70&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Japan has a skills shortage just like other major economies but &#8220;massive&#8221; is totally incorrect. I have spent many years living in Japan and let me tell you that the Japanese Govt. does not care about its people at all. There is welfare insurance but it only available if you have paid your premiums and it is available for 6 months only. After that many Japanese live with relatives or struggle immensely with daily living. Pensions in Japan are low and due to Japan having the fastest ageing population in the world and the largest Govt. debt in the world times are pretty tough. In a matter of less than 10 years Japan went from no.3 to no.19 in GDP terms per capita while Govt. debt continued to soar. </p>
<p>There are labor shortages in aged care and nursing but to be truthful one of Japan&rsquo;s biggest problems is lack of jobs. i go back to Japan every few years and have seen a massive drop in Japan&rsquo;s standard of living; people live in parks, line up at soup kitchens, young kids are into all sorts of drug abuse and many use prostitution to supplement their incomes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you have been to Japan if you had, your comments would have been more realistic. Japan does have alot of illegal migrants too but their job prospects are not good at the moment. Any transit hub in japanese cities and big towns is full of Pakis, Africans, Iranians and Filipinos looking for work or just hanging out lowering the social content of the area. Japan is even more of a basket case than most Western nations at the moment.</p>

That&rsquo;s true, but the Japanese Prime Minister was actually quoting an article in the New York Times when he said it - a fact that was conveniently ignored when Jesse Jackson and the other Race Hate Industry opportunists indignantly demanded an opology.</p>

		<p>As to the differences in the Japanese study between children from lower and higher-incomed parents, it seems obvious that on average, higher income parents achieved their income status (among other causes) primarily because of higher IQs, and have genetically passed that on to their children. </p>
<p>&#8220;Hiroaki Mimizuka, a professor specializing in educational sociology at Ochanomizu University in Tokyo and a member of the panel, said the results point to the possibility that providing monetary assistance for education could improve students&rsquo; abilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here, the wheels come off and the report on the study dresses up as farce, as educators substitute &#8220;abilities&#8221; for capacities, and otherwise search for PC reasons and not IQ - while also promoting additional funding for their educational institutions.<br>

		<p>The Japanese do have their minorities such as Koreans. The Koreans often work in the least-skilled construction jobs, and are considered to be shiftless, low achievers (I don&rsquo;t live there, so don&rsquo;t blame me if this disturbs you). Koreans also run pachinko parlors (kind of like pinball crossed with a slot machine), and cry racial discrimination whenever the cops clamp down on them for having fixed the machines. </p>
<p>There are also Chinese in Japan, some of whom are full-time criminals and others who are part-timers. Many are illegal aliens.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know to what degree Japanese suffer from political correctness when it comes to class. The ones I have met don&rsquo;t seem to have any such pretensions. Unless you come from a good family, and attended a respectable university, there is little basis for believing that you will achieve anything in life.</p>

		<p>Seems to me that one is not a causitive factor of the other, rather that they both are results of a strong work ethic, persistence, and to a lesser degree, intelligence.</p>

		<p>As far as it goes in racially-homogenous Japan, the correlation between higher incomes and higher test scores is probably correct.  However, causality has not been established at all here.  The most likely explanation is that smart children are usually produced by smart parents (it&rsquo;s that genetics thing rearing its head again), and these parents - due to their own intelligence - are likely to have high incomes.</p>

		<p>As much as I respect American IQ research, there are still no classical studies of the relationship between income and IQ. </p>
<p>If you look at available data, like AP test scores - they correlate profoundly with income! </p>
<p>If you were to seperate IQ test scores of whites and blacks into income - boy, would American Renaissance readers be shocked to see what happens! Your DNA determinism would evaporate into thin air. </p>
