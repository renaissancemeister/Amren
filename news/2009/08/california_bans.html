<h1>California Bans Threatening Noose Displays</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Aug. 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California law already bans threatening displays of swastikas and burning crosses [on someone else&rsquo;s property or at a school or workplace]. Now add nooses to the list.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed legislation making such displays punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $5,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[The bill was introduced by Democratic Assemblywoman Wilma Carter] after noose hangings were displayed in several Halloween decorations last year. Two such displays were effigies of then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.</p>
<p>The law, which takes effect Jan. 1, will not ban displays by a homeowner, which are considered constitutionally protected speech.<br>

		<p>In a recent year over 34,000 white women claimed they were raped or sexually assaulted by a black man or by a group of blacks yet California&rsquo;s only concerned seems to be that constituents have the right, and the latest breaking information on nooses. Seems to me they could be just a little more with the times. Would being within a Century of the current news be too much to ask?  </p>

		<p>Yep, noose displays as a serious problem in California, is right up there with sunburns. My God, the State of California is bankrupt, its credit rating is shot, its crime is through the roof, streets and infrastructure are crumbling, hundreds of cities are broke and all coffers empty. Yet time and resources must be used to address &#8220;noose displays&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I wondering if this law includes black hoaxers who hang nooses at their places of work to garner sympathy.</p>

		<p>Anonymous above is correct in comparing concerns about nooses with concerns about rapes.  I believe that the only appropriate response to Obama&rsquo;s attorney general&rsquo;s claim that we are &#8220;cowardly&#8221; in talking about race is to label Obama and his attorney general as &#8220;cowardly&#8221; in talking about rape.</p>
<p>Rape is a far more serious problem for Euro-Americans&rsquo; well-being than chatting about race.  It is also instructive that so-called hate crime charges or enhancements are never linked to cases of rape, no matter what is said or done, and no matter how frequently a person of one demographic rapes members of another demographic.  Clearly, after a certain point, a pattern in raping establishes all the evidence of a hate crime that could be needed. </p>

		<p>The state of California now has a population that is 40% white,  60% black/hispanic/asian. What protections will be put in place for whites as the white minority shrinks even more?</p>

		<p>To those who commented about nooses vs. rapes, there is a clear connection between the two.  Black have always been far more likely to rape than most other races.  There is no reason to suspect that this was the case in the Old South as well.  The punishment for rape would have been hanging.  Black men were more likely to be rapists - so naturally they were more likely to be hanged.  Now that we don&rsquo;t hang rapists, black rapes have skyrocketed and neither the blacks, nor their leftist sympathizers, want to be reminded of how things used to be - or how they will be in the future.</p>
