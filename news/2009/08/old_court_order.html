<h1>Old Court Order Could Stop Sale of Historically Black School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erika Hobbs, Orlando Sentinel, August 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 1951 court order that has been collecting dust for decades could thwart Orange County school officials&rsquo; plans for selling a historically black school and its surrounding land.</p>
<p>The school district wants to sell 115 acres to Eatonville for development that could bring the town new tax revenue. The tract includes Robert L. Hungerford Preparatory High, a magnet school that was shuttered in June.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tricky deal, however, because the 58-year-old order governs how part of the land can be used. And it&rsquo;s a deal that will be closely watched because it could revitalize Eatonville&rsquo;s anemic economy at the cost of losing Hungerford Prep, a symbol of achievement in the black community.</p>
<p>The order, written years before desegregation, requires that the property continue &#8220;as a site for the operation of a public school thereon for Negroes with emphasis on the vocational education for Negroes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Robert Hungerford Chapel Trust, which sold the land to the district, insists that roughly 50 acres now occupied by Hungerford Prep and nearby Hungerford Elementary must continue to be used for public schools. If not, the trustees say, the restricted land will revert to the trust.</p>
<p>The school district, however, contends that it can comply with the order just by continuing to operate the elementary school, said school district attorney Frank Kruppenbacher. He and the district&rsquo;s real estate attorneys said that the school system is required only to use the land for &#8220;educational purposes&#8221;  &mdash;  a term that does not appear in the original court order or in subsequent ones that permitted the district to sell off other pieces of the Hungerford land.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the courts will have to interpret the order&rsquo;s modern-day meaning. School and Eatonville officials plan to ask the courts to lift the restrictions on most of the land so that the sale can proceed, either now or a few years down the road. The trust, however, plans to sue to block the deal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then, this year, as a budget crisis escalated, the School Board abruptly closed Hungerford Prep. That&rsquo;s when the momentum for the land deal picked up.</p>
<p>District and School Board officials began to wonder whether the historical significance of the school may have run its course, and whether the opportunity the land sale offers for reinvestment in Eatonville could be more important to the black community than hanging on to a piece of history of the segregated South.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never did want to get rid of Hungerford Prep,&#8221; said board member Kat Gordon, who reluctantly gave in to the sale. &#8220;But we know we need to let it go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eatonville Mayor Bruce Mount, elected in March, didn&rsquo;t want an empty campus in the town&rsquo;s back yard, and district officials needed the cash. So in June, leaders outlined a new deal that would sell the last large, developable tract in Eatonville to the town. It includes Hungerford Prep, Hungerford Elementary and Lake Bell. No price has been negotiated yet, and an appraisal is under way.</p>
<p>The school district would maintain control of Hungerford Elementary and would use its portion of the proceeds to beef up early childhood programs in Eatonville.</p>

		<p>A historically black school?  Imagine!!  When I went to the Univ. of N. Carolina in 1976 for grad school, the head of my dept. took me (a CA girl) on a tour of the local area, which included a visit to Central University - a &#8220;historically black school.&#8221;  My prof. hastened to add that even though it was still black for the most part, it was &#8220;not so by mandate&hellip;&#8221;  Plus, his (white) wife taught there - probably because there weren&rsquo;t any available profs from Affirmative Action yet.  And it was this SAME school that, years later, produced the lying black who accused the white boys on the Duke Lacrosse Team of raping her; of course they were eventually acquitted because she lied through her teeth, but it took a terrible toll on the innocent young white men who had been accused.  &#8220;Historically black school?&#8221;  They&rsquo;re still doing all they can to &#8220;get back&#8221; at the white folks (who were good enough to give them a school in the first place - they were incapable of creating it themselves).  I say get rid of all of these &#8220;schools&#8221;, and move into the present so that the jerques who hate whites can be &#8220;assimilated&#8221; (yeah, like ACORN)&hellip;.</p>

		<p>So I&rsquo;m assuming that historical marker signs could be put up at 3/4 of the schools in American designating them as former &#8220;Historically White Schools&#8221;.</p>

<p>What a great website&hellip;thanks!</p>
<p>I found this there&hellip;a black member of the Dallas County Commission protesting and demanding an apology when a white member used the expression &#8220;black hole&#8221;! </p>
<p>The black member said scientists could just have easily named them &#8220;white holes&#8221;!</p>
<p>Put this guy in charge of shaping up the science courses in his county&rsquo;s schools so the schools can be accredited.</p>
<p>Videos of the incident and an interview afterward:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/mwz93f" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/mwz93f</a></p>
<p>If one could visually see the differences in black brains and white brains, I bet the difference would be as marked as the difference in skin color.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not JUST a matter of intelligence&hellip;.the way of confronting the world&rsquo;s realities is so different&hellip;.blacks like to just spew words at realities.</p>

<p>A black talk radio hostess in St. Louis objected to the world &#8220;blackmail,&#8221; as a racist conspiracy by linguists.  Therefore, she started calling the concept &#8220;whitemail.&#8221;</p>

		<p>How come we can&rsquo;t call something &#8220;Historically White&#8221; as most were pre-Civil Rights Era?  Oh, that&rsquo;s right.  I guess that&rsquo;s &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
