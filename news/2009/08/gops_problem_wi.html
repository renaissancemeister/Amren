<h1>GOP&rsquo;s Problem With Hispanics</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ruben Navarrette Jr., CNN, August 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the documents, [Karl] Rove was &#8220;agitated&#8221; because Republican lawmakers in New Mexico  &mdash;  namely, Sen. Pete Domenici and Rep. Heather Wilson  &mdash;  were complaining that Iglesias wasn&rsquo;t investigating allegations of voter fraud and pursuing corruption indictments against Democratic officials. The GOP&rsquo;s targets included New Mexico Attorney General Patricia Madrid who ran against Wilson unsuccessfully in 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} New Mexico isn&rsquo;t Iowa or Maine or North Dakota. In a state like New Mexico, with a significant Hispanic population, concerns about &#8220;voter fraud&#8221; are really a proxy for something else: anxiety over changing demographics fueled by illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Rove figured out early on that Republicans needed Hispanic support to win elections and he helped shepherd George W. Bush&rsquo;s impressive inroads into the Hispanic community. Bush got 35 percent of the Hispanic vote in the 2000 presidential election, and a staggering 44 percent in 2004. A lot of that was due to Rove.</p>
<p>Then here comes New Mexico and Rove is carrying water for a pair of knucklehead Republicans  &mdash;  Domenici and Wilson  &mdash;  who, it appears, would just as soon try to suppress the Hispanic vote as compete for it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Republicans in New Mexico were clearly terrified about a surge in Hispanic voting power and how it could lead to countless defeats for the GOP in future elections. That&rsquo;s because most Hispanics vote Democratic, and  &mdash;  thanks to shenanigans like this  &mdash;  you can see why.</p>

		<p>The GOP&rsquo;s problem with Hispanics is that they can never out-spend the Democrats on social welfare.  If the GOP goes left, this gives Democrats manuvering room to go further left.  Therefore, Hispanics will always vote majority Democrat. </p>
<p>However, Hispanics are a lower mirror demographic of whites.  What that means is that if the Republican gets a higher percentage of the vote now than compared to four years ago, s/he&rsquo;ll also get a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote compared to four years ago, but much lower than the whites.  And vice versa.</p>

		<p>  Voter fraud is voter fraud. <br>
  Illegal immigrants should never be able to vote and those who help them vote are commiting crimes under the law and need to be prosecuted.<br>
  Being Hispanic and voting is suspect because so many of the Hispanics in the US admit having both legal and illegal members in their houses.<br>
  Many more are former illegas who benefited from amnesties.<br>
   New Supreme Court Justice Sotomeyer, said in her articles that as she uses the word -people from Spain are not Hispanic.<br>
Only non-whites seem to qualify for her and many others. Spain is the Hispanic Pennesula but that does not seem to matter.<br>
  I am Hispanic but I am white.<br>
  Soon you will not be Americans if you are white. It is no different than claiming that whites cannot be Hispanics<br>
   Deport all illegals.<br>

		<p><i>Investigation of &ldquo;voter fraud&rdquo; was driven by &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Let me add to the list of &#8220;racist&#8221; connotations.</p>
<p>Concerns of irredentism is &#8220;racist&#8221; because mostly Mexicans are exhibiting irredentist tendencies.</p>
<p>War on bribery is &#8220;racist&#8221; because mostly new arrivals from corrupt Third-World countries engage in it.</p>
<p>Prosecuting DUI, trespassing, street rioting, gangsterism, drug trafficking, immigration violations, voting fraud, and identity theft is &#8220;racist&#8221; because it has &#8220;disparate effect&#8221; on ehtnic minorities.</p>
<p>Concerns with obesity are &#8220;racist&#8221; because these are mostly &#8220;poor minorities&#8221; that are obese. (Can you imagine that there are morons who believe that poverty and obesity are not mutually contradictory classifiers?)</p>
<p>With this kind of logic, all that any &#8220;ethnic minority&#8221; needs to get away with a violation is to make sure that the lion share of its membership perpetrates it.</p>
<p>From more theoretic perspective, since the &#8220;Liberal&#8221; dogmatic ideology is a self-contradictory system of believes, a skilled rhetorist may formally derive (prove, that is) any absurdity from that ideology.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, this is one of the most basic inconsistency tests for a set of statements (for instance, for an ideology): it contains self-contradictory claims if and only if one can prove arbitrary absurdity from it.</p>

<p>Knowing how they lied about the Jena 6 attempted murder, I refused to read past the first line, because I know I won&rsquo;t be getting the truth.  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, their record of falsification is so great I know if I read the report I&rsquo;d be wasting a lot of time trying to figure out what the true story might be, so I had to pass.</p>

		<p>Every time after I read a Ruben Navarrette article I feel the need to take a bath.  About the same thing happens after reading a Ben Wattenberg article about how all immigrants are soooooo wonderful.</p>
<p>In my opinion, both of these people cherry pick &#8220;facts&#8221; and omit unfavorable truths, are illogical in their thought processes, all while being glib as snake oil salesmen.  They are both educated individuals, however, their spiel assumes their readers are village idiots.  For them, the only answer is to open the floodgates to tens of millions of immigrants, and those whose oppose such a move are ignorant and/or racist people.  </p>
<p>As for the law, if we are really good people, why should we even care about such a trivial issue per their logic.  Everything will work out fine &hellip; just take their word for it.</p>

		<p>My opinion is never going to change on the GOP. Like I said, it is useless to white voters and is losing its footing as every year passes so that all it really needs is to have the rug pulled out from under it completely. Why should caucasians put more time and energy into propping up an organization that does nothing for them? Let it collapse and something real, some authentic to white interests will take its place. Just as the Democratic Party basically serves so-called minorities interests.</p>

		<p>if US Atty Iglesias wasn&rsquo;t prosecuting illegal aliens or those in govt who harbor them, he wasn&rsquo;t doing his job. If anything, Rove and the Attorney General danced around this too long. The Hispanic superstar should have been fired. He worked for the President, not for the liberal pro-alien media.There is no scandal about the firing of Iglesias, a prosecutor who wouldn&rsquo;t prosecute. The scandal is liberal political officials&rsquo; covering up illegal immigration, starting with the Attorney General of New Mexico.</p>

**********</p>
<p>Why on Earth SHOULDN&rsquo;T we be concerned about changing demographics fueled by illegal immigration?  Illegals have no right to be here, and they certainly have no right to participate in our electoral system - no matter how much Navarette protests to the contrary. </p>
<p>America has made a huge mistake in refusing to deal with the problem of immigration head on.  Mass deportation is the only solution that will work, for the simple reason that all other solutions lead to them staying in our midst and accelerating our demographic downfall.</p>

<p>For Chris Mathews:Something will fill the poltical vacum and it is called WHITE NATIONIALISM which is a complete rejection  of the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans at the hands of post-1965 non-whites.</p>
<p>The only thing the Repblican and Democratic parties offer milions of Native Born White Amreican Males is race-replacement and economic dispossession.</p>

<p>And Glenn Beck describes no such condition as socialism today.  His view is fascism, the merger between government and private enterprise.</p>
<p>Incidentally, blacks prefer communism of all the isms, because they can&rsquo;t compete in a civilized world and must be recipients of other people&rsquo;s work who are capable enough to contribute something useful to society.</p>

		<p>All humans are, by nature, communistic.  Look at small children.  They instinctively offer to share when they have more than they need, and instinctively get angry when someone with more than they don&rsquo;t share. </p>
<p>Tribal societies are very communistic.  Successful hunters share what they have with the rest of the community, knowing next hunt they might come home empty handed.  </p>
<p>The problem is that communism only works when the community is small enough that you can keep tabs on who is generous and who is parasitic.  I read one hypothesis that humans can only keep social track of about 200 people.  </p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons are essentially the only group that evolved a new social system   &mdash;   based on private property, rule of law and self-reliance   &mdash;   that works in communities so large that you can&rsquo;t know everyone. But it is a fragile system because it runs against human nature.  </p>

		<p>Bobster is correct.</p>
<p>Hispanics tend to be low-income.  Low-income people tend to vote Democratic, because that&rsquo;s where the handouts come from.  Therefore, Rove&rsquo;s &#8220;strategy&#8221;   &mdash;   while maybe helpful short-term to Bush - is a recipe for Republican destruction long-term.</p>
<p>If the hispanic population were fixed, it might make political sense to pander for a minority portion of that vote   &mdash;   provided you did not alienate a greater number of voters from your base.</p>
<p>But pandering to an essentially infinite population using policies that encourage the unlimited growth of that group is like the old joke about the tailor who loses money on every suit he sells, but makes it up in volume.</p>

		<p>When the acorn (oops, I mean &ldquo;census&rdquo; worker) comes to the door, ask for identification. You will need it for the police report that you will file after your house is broken into. Some of the questions such as &ldquo;what time do you leave for work?&rdquo; and &ldquo;how many hours do you work per day?&rdquo; can (and will) be used by acorn census workers to &ldquo;case&rdquo; your residence and will be seen as an opportunity to take whatever they want to fulfill their sense of &ldquo;social justice&rdquo;. I plan on asking for ID, writing everything down, and then telling them to leave (without answering any questions) since I cannot verify their identity.<br>
Another way to &ldquo;make things right&rdquo; is to &ldquo;skew&rdquo; the census (if you choose to &ldquo;cooperate&rdquo; and answer questions). The only question that is legally required to be answered is the one concerning &ldquo;how many people live at this residence?&rdquo; Be creative. You should have at least SIX people living with you.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had a running email battle/discussion with Ruben Navarette on a couple of occasions; while newspapers seem happy to give him a platform to express his open border/leftist views, he is incapable of understanding even the basis of any in opposition to his.<br>
His obvious position on illegal immigration is that it is OK to break our laws, and while he stands on a constitutional right to speak his mind, has contempt for anything in opposition to his view.<br>
For that reason, I laugh derisively at his attempts to present himself as a journalist, and indeed, he and others like him probably have a lot to do with falling subscription numbers in local newspapers. He is not a journalist, he is just another &#8220;useful idiot&#8221;.<br>
I cancelled my subscription to the SA express in, part, for that very reason. I don&rsquo;t have time for idiots, useful or otherwise.</p>
