			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Fausset, Los Angeles Times, August 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The test results baffled Florida State University psychologist Ashby Plant. {snip}</p>
<p>Plant and her colleagues had just administered a racial Implicit Association Test to 74 white college students. A common tool in psychology lab work, the IAT purports to measure the kinds of biases people may not admit or even know they harbor. It is one of the more troubling, and fascinating, realities in Plant&rsquo;s line of work that when the test is administered to whites, about 75% typically show some degree of anti-black bias.</p>
<p>But in this case, her subjects were displaying almost no bias against African Americans. In fact, about 45% appeared to be favoring blacks over whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was spring 2008  &mdash;  a moment of mounting intensity in America&rsquo;s presidential race. It was also the moment when Plant, 40, found herself delving into a new sub-specialty with few precedents in the social sciences. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} How are racial attitudes changing, if at all, in the age of the first black president?</p>
<p>Plant and her colleagues began speculating that their surprising numbers had something to do with the candidate Barack Obama. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thus far, some of the most widely discussed test results have been contradictory. If there has been an &#8220;Obama effect&#8221; on racial consciousness, it&rsquo;s not clear yet what it is.</p>
<p>Ray Friedman, a management professor at Vanderbilt University, conducted studies that suggested exposure to Obama&rsquo;s convention speech and election helped black students close an achievement gap with whites on a verbal aptitude test.</p>
<p>But in another study, a New York University researcher, Joshua Aronson, found that thinking about Obama had no discernible effect on black students&rsquo; test scores.</p>
<p>At Stanford University, researchers led by graduate student Daniel Effron found what might be called a reverse Obama effect. In their studies, white Obama supporters showed favoritism for whites over blacks in certain hypothetical situations  &mdash;  perhaps because by supporting Obama, they felt bestowed with non-racist &#8220;moral credentials&#8221; that made them more comfortable siding with fellow whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To determine if Obama had accounted for a true change of mind, Plant and her main collaborator, University of Wisconsin psychologist Patricia G. Devine, would have to overcome a problem that has shaped the course of their field more than any other in recent years: How to record people&rsquo;s racial attitudes when it has become taboo to openly voice prejudices?</p>
<p>One key tool is the Implicit Association Test. Developed in 1998 by University of Washington psychologist Anthony Greenwald and two other researchers, the test is still controversial among some scientists who question whether it can accurately measure such subtleties of thought.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When the users consistently show hesitation in matching, say, black faces with positive words or whites with negative words, believers in the test see the possible work of powerful, unconscious forces. Whether we like it or not, they argue, the mind sometimes struggles to make certain associations.</p>
<p>They are biases to which minorities themselves are not immune: In studies involving thousands of test participants on the Internet, about 40% of blacks showed an anti-black bias, and roughly 1 in 3 Muslims showed an anti-Muslim bias, said Brian Nosek, a University of Virginia researcher who runs Project Implicit, the ongoing Web project.</p>
<p>Plant and her team didn&rsquo;t think they could show that Obama was the sole cause of reduced bias  &mdash;  it would be difficult to isolate his influence, given all of the stimuli out in the world. But the researchers thought they might be able to at least show a correlation by devising a two-part test.</p>
<p>In the first part, 229 University of Wisconsin students, all nonblack, were given Implicit Association Tests, then asked, among other things, to list five thoughts that came to mind when they considered black people.</p>
<p>Once again, the students, as a group, failed to show much anti-black bias.</p>
<p>Researchers then noted if the participants listed any &#8220;positive black exemplars&#8221;  &mdash;  for instance, Obama, Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks. They found that students who listed a positive exemplar showed less bias on the IAT.</p>
<p>That alone was interesting, but was Obama the one reducing the bias scores?{snip}</p>
<p>Their solution was to call in 79 nonblack students for an experiment at Florida State. They too were given an IAT. Separately, the researchers exposed them, subliminally, to the words &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; by flashing them on a computer screen for 55 milliseconds each. (The effectiveness of such subliminal &#8220;priming&#8221; in advertising remains in question, but psychologists have used it effectively to influence people&rsquo;s responses in lab settings for decades.)</p>
<p>The students then were shown a succession of letter groupings, some real words and some nonsense strings of letters, and asked to pick out the real words. Some of the words were crime-related. Other words were government-related, such as &#8220;politician&#8221; or &#8220;president.&#8221;</p>
<p>This exercise would test how quickly the students were able, when primed with the word &#8220;black,&#8221; to pick out the positive, government-style words, as compared with the negative words.</p>
<p>The researchers compared the results of the subliminal exercise to the IAT results. In essence: Those who responded more quickly to government-related words when primed with the word &#8220;black&#8221; also showed lower implicit prejudice.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that Obama&rsquo;s rise seemed to have influenced &#8220;the underlying associations at least some people carry around in their minds about black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the conflicting conclusions, Plant believes she is on to something  &mdash;  so much so that she is now trying to determine if she can design a study that would isolate Obama ascause of lowered bias.</p>
<p>Its design has consumed Plant and her research assistants much of the summer. In late June they gathered in a conference room in Florida State&rsquo;s psychology building to see where they stood.</p>
<p>Plant nodded to graduate student Corey Columb, 23, who sat across the table. &#8220;The idea Corey had  &mdash;  an idea which I think is very clever  &mdash;  is to temporarily undo the [Obama] effect,&#8221; Plant said. {snip}</p>
<p>In other words: since they assume that Obama has inoculated people against bias, they hoped to temporarily reinfect a few volunteers. Then they would reintroduce half of them to images of Obama, to see if he could cure them.</p>
<p>But what black image could serve, for these purposes, as the anti-Obama?</p>
<p>&#8220;The ones we&rsquo;ve come up with so far that would be relevant to the generation here at the university would be O.J. Simpson and Mike Tyson,&#8221; Columb said, though he added that they were struggling. Would students know Simpson? And wasn&rsquo;t Mike Tyson sort of rehabilitating his image?</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a copy of the email I sent to Richard Fausset, commenting on his article:</p>
<p>The acts described in this article are despicable and viciously anti-white. Time to skewer a few Liberal sacred cows.</p>
<p>1) For whites &ldquo;bias&rdquo; is just healthy instinct and good common sense. Race is an important aspect of individual and group identity and most people have strong feelings of racial loyalty; preferring the culture and way of life associated with their race. Racial loyalty is normal and healthy. All non-white groups instinctively pursue their own interests, and legitimately so. It is only whites who have been taught that it is immoral to take even the most basic steps to ensure their survival. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with whites liking themselves more than blacks. Certainly Liberals would have no problem with blacks liking themselves more than whites but who ever said the Left had principle?</p>
<p>2) &ldquo;But in another study, a New York University researcher, Joshua Aronson, found that thinking about Obama had no discernible effect on black students&rsquo; test scores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be foolish to expect it to. Blacks have a lower average intelligence than whites and the mere act of &ldquo;thinking about Obama&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t going to raise it.</p>
<p>3) &ldquo;Researchers then noted if the participants listed any &ldquo;positive black exemplars&rdquo; &mdash; for instance, Obama, Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks. They found that students who listed a positive exemplar showed less bias on the IAT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive black exemplars?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t make me laugh. Martin Luther King Jr. was a plagiarizing fraud and Communist sympathizer who believed in punishing whites for black failure. Rosa Parks was a nonentity and in deep with the reds as well. And our Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones in the white house has demonstrated some impressive shallowness so far.</p>
<p>4) &ldquo;The researchers concluded that Obama&rsquo;s rise seemed to have influenced &ldquo;the underlying associations at least some people carry around in their minds about black people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Woe be to those sensible souls who notice what blacks are actually like. Liberals believe it&rsquo;s wrong to hold blacks accountable for their actions. Blacks may rob, rape and murder whites in epidemic proportions, they may be crass low-lifes, they may demand yet more hand-outs and preferences but they can&rsquo;t be made to answer for it because Liberals see them not as human beings responsible for their moral choices but as set dressing in the Left&rsquo;s constant war with the Right.</p>

<p>These Jewish professors always come up with the most remarkable results.</p>
<p>So he is saying that IQ is environmental, which is strange because the latest genetic tests proof that IQ is mostly genetic.</p>
<p>What is also strange is how the main stream media avoids discussing or even mentioning these genetic studies.</p>

		<p>how stupid college students are. obama is not &#8220;black&#8221;. he&rsquo;s  a hybrid. he&rsquo;s black when it suits him and white when it suits him. his biography is public. raised by white people. not even &#8220;african american&#8221; but half african, even indonesian. a hustler that becomes what you want to see and believe. that is what he is.</p>

		<p>i am white and i prefer to be among white people. Does that make me biased or a racist? No. The thing about these IAT tests is it is designed to show a bias in a person no matter which answers are given. Hardly a fair test.  They(blacks) tend to propagate such a negative image of themselves that any individual who is able to think coherently cannot help but arrive at certain conclusions about the black race. its not racism or bias. </p>

		<p> I have noticed what I think might be an effect of the ascension to power of the African Socialist (a.k.a. B. Hussein),<br>
in my (affluent, very liberal) community. I would be interested in input from other AR posters, to see whether my impressions are anecdotal or reflect a real phenomenon: it seems to me I see more mixed coupled on the street, esp. black men and caucasian women on dates. As we all know, despite blacks going on and on for years about the alleged war against <br>
their young males, it is in fact White males that are the main target of our culture&rsquo;s galloping multicultural, anti-Western madness. Can this self hatred   &mdash;  - abetted by a dictatorial &#8220;Dear Leader&#8221; whom the media and other, largely White &#8216;elites&rsquo; adulate and slobber over, and whose instincts are clearly anti-America and anti-White   &mdash;  - be having an effect on our White women, who are attracted to what they perceive as political strength or ascendancy? and of course, the wimpy, &#8216;sensitive&rsquo;, Starbucks-employee type of male   &mdash;  - we all know the type   &mdash;  - doesn&rsquo;t help. It is no wonder Hollywood has been more and more recruiting foreigners for this generation&rsquo;s tough-he-man character actors.</p>

		<p>These &#8220;studies&#8221; are fraudulent Orwellian propaganda designed to attack the truth and the truth is that Obama in the White House has made blacks exceedingly uppity and their baseless arrogance and animosity towards whites has brought white&rsquo;s opinion of blacks to a new low.  Besides, the very idea of a racial minority governing a racial majority is against all known reason and is clinically insane; ergo I will never recognize Obama&rsquo;s right to occupy the White House and I am not alone in my thinking&hellip;          </p>

		<p>The big error is that these tests (as flawed as they are) were given to non-black college students.  That could mean whites, or it could mean Hispanic, Oriental, India, Middle Eastern or a few others.  White college students tend to be more liberal anyway, and the other racial groups, young or not, tend to the left, some more than others.</p>
<p>Those taking the test were fooled by the pseudo-intellectual rhetoric surrounding the tests.  If they were older, they would have seen right through the fluff.</p>

		<p>A closer analysis of these &#8220;tests&#8221; will no doubt reveal what they always do, bias on the part of the &#8220;psychologist&#8221; administering or designing the test, not the people tested. It is comical what passes for science these days.</p>
