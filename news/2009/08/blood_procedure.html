<h1>Blood Procedure Allows Kidney Transplants, Can Help Minorities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arthur Brice, CNN, August 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Surgeons at two Washington hospitals have performed seven kidney transplants involving 14 recipients and donors who did not match, using a process that virtually eliminates the chances of organ rejection.</p>
<p>The process, called plasmapheresis, can make it easier for underserved African-American patients to receive organs for transplant. Of the 80,000 people on the kidney transplant list, 36 percent are African-Americans but only 15 percent of living donor kidneys go to African-Americans. That discrepancy is caused, in large part, by a lack of suitable matching organs, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says. As a rule, people are genetically more similar to others who share their ethnicity or race than to people of other races.</p>
<p>Although minorities typically donate in proportion to their percentage of the population, they have greater needs for transplants because of diseases that are more prevalent in some ethnic or racial groups. African-Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders and Latinos, for example, are three times more likely than Caucasians to have kidney disease, the health department says.</p>
<p>The transplants were performed at Georgetown University Hospital and Washington Hospital Center over a four-day period in July.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The transplant teams were led by Dr. Keith Melancon, director of the kidney and pancreas transplant program at Georgetown University Hospital, and Dr. Jimmy Light, director of transplantation services at Washington Hospital Center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By using plasmapheresis, or plasma exchange, all seven patients were able to match closely enough with their donors to allow the transplants. In plasmapheresis, a machine removes antibodies from a patient&rsquo;s blood that can cause organ rejection.</p>
<p>The kidney recipients were in a &#8220;highly sensitized&#8221; state, which means their immune systems were on high alert and extremely likely to reject a transplant. As a result, Melancon said, the patients practically had no chance of finding a suitable donor.</p>
<p>All of the patients were on kidney dialysis until the transplants.</p>
<p>Because of their heightened immune systems, the patients were started on immunosuppressant drugs about a week before the surgeries, Melancon said. Transplant patients typically start on immunosuppressant therapy on the day of surgery, he said.</p>
<p>The patients also underwent two rounds of plasmapheresis before the surgery and two rounds afterward.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Six of the seven kidney recipients are African-American, as are five of the seven donors. The two Caucasian donors, a 29-year-old graduate student and a 60-year-old Catholic pastoral counselor, had no connection with the recipients.</p>
<p>The other five donors were a spouse, a cousin, a brother, a sister and a friend of the recipients, Melancon said. But the donors did not necessarily give their kidneys to their relatives or friend. Who received which kidney from whom was determined by who was the best match.</p>
<p>Although minority donors tend to match better with minority recipients because of genetic similarities, the best match for the Caucasian recipient was an African-American donor, Melancon said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The use of plasmapheresis is significant, Melancon said, because it increases the chances of African-Americans to receive life-saving organs. Plasmapheresis has been used in transplant surgery for about 10 years, the doctor said.</p>
<p>The Washington area, which has a large African-American population, also has the highest rate of end-stage kidney failure in the United States, hospital officials said.</p>
<p>African-Americans also stay on dialysis longer than Caucasians  &mdash;  five years versus three years  &mdash;  and therefore become more sensitized to antibodies from prospective donors and less able to receive transplanted organs. The filters in the dialysis machine activate the blood&rsquo;s immune cells to become more sensitized, Melancon said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African-Americans in general are more sensitized but scientists don&rsquo;t know exactly why, Melancon said. The surgeon said he believes it&rsquo;s because many African-Americans&rsquo; ancestors came from sub-Saharan Africa, where they were subjected to more infectious agents than, say, people in Europe. That could have sensitized Africans&rsquo; immune system to more antigens, he said.</p>

		<p>There is almost nothing Whites can do as a group, but as individuals we can at least stop donating organs that will be denied to Whites and given to non Whites by non White affirmative action physicians.</p>

		<p>I will donate no organ as it will just go to some black or other nonwhite. No, thank you. </p>
<p>Since blacks and other nonwhites do not donate organs(or much of anything else) for their own, it is left up to Whites to do the job they won&rsquo;t do themselves? Again, no, thank you.</p>

		<p>Highly ironic that blacks rarely donate, while white do in great numbers. Yet these organs are being reserved for blacks.</p>

		<p>I will only donate an organ if I&rsquo;m alive and know exactly who it is going to. Perhaps the media could actually make clear the reason WHY blacks get less transplanted organs: blacks donate in proportionally dismal numbers compared to whites: virtually none. Instead of the phrase CNN used to explain it: &#8220;There are less organs available for blacks.&#8221;  :::insert violin music here:::</p>
<p>Just tell the freakin&rsquo; truth!</p>

		<p>Again,  implied anti-white propaganda by bigoted anti-democracy liberal Marxists by stating blacks are under-served for transplants (victimization )but fail to balance out with the correct answer to this dilemma buy stating that blacks don&rsquo;t donate blood, or organs representative of their numbers/percentage  of the total population; by this accurate fact, blacks are &#8221; over-served or serviced &#8221;  using white people&rsquo;s blood or donated organs that should go to white members of the community to reflect fairness and equality to the white donors or their families.</p>

		<p>This topic infuriates me every time I see it  &mdash;  but it does give us a chance to Spread The Word as to why no White should willingly donate organs.</p>
<p>The following is one of many reasons why Whites must take their names off organ donor lists today:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Houston Chronicle Online reports&hellip;124 undocumented immigrants donated organs, while 258 received them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you believe blacks or hispanics would willingly donate their organs to Whites?</p>
<p>Take your name and that or your loved ones off donation lists, tell your loved ones and put it in writing, in your will if necessary. Tell everyone you know, as loudly and clearly as possible, that your organs are not to be donated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that Whites are subjected to anti-White AA, Hate Laws and are openly discriminated against while they&rsquo;re alive.  The same process will happen to you and your loved ones after death as your organs are alloted to non-Whites via government-mandated AA for transplants.</p>
<p>Same reason why my sons will never fight this anti-White government&rsquo;s dirty overseas wars.</p>
<p>Spread the Word.</p>

		<p>The nursing and medical school textbooks bend over backwards to be politically correct and pro every race, ethnicity and culture but White American.</p>
<p>But even these pro non White textbooks have big charts about racial, gender and ethnic differences.  Those charts have a section for blood and organ donation.  Every ethnicity and race but Whites refuse to donate organs or blood.</p>
<p>I love Bon&rsquo;s suggestion last spring of keeping our White children home from school during test week.  If the school districts love non White immigrant children so much, let them deal with the low test scores resulting from non White test takers.</p>
<p>My twin grandchildren will start kindergarten in a few weeks.  I am working on my son to keep his children home during test week.</p>
<p>The colleges and schools discriminate against our white children.  So why should our white children bring up the school test scores?</p>
<p>Other suggestions, never, never eat out unless you can find a restaurant that employees white americans.  Most of the expensive dinner houses have White waiters but the kitchen and busboys are 100 percent illegal hispanics so avoid those places as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we can&rsquo;t avoid food.  It is planted, harvested, processed and sold by hispanics, mostly illegals.</p>

		<p>Poster no. 9 is correct. The statement in the article that minorities donate organs or even plasma in proportionate numbers is a blatant lie. It is more convenient to state an untruth than to face the truth: that minorities through their own lifestyle choices place a disproportionate burden on the US healthcare system.  This system is underwritten by White taxpayers, and kept supplied with White organ donations. If you or your relatives go on a waiting list for an organ donation, you are &#8220;competing&#8221; with a system of racial preferences that is stacked against you. 50% of those on the waiting list are minorities:</p>

<p>The below article says that black distrust of the medical system is what discourages them from being organ donors:</p>
