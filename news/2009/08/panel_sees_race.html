			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Haberkorn, Washington Times, August 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights says some little-noticed provisions in the House health care bill are racially discriminatory, and it intends to ask President Obama and Congress to rewrite sections that factor in race when awarding billions in contracts, scholarships and grants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a draft of a letter the commission approved Friday, the group raises constitutional questions about giving preferential treatment to minority students for scholarships, and about favoring medical schools and organizations that have a record of sending graduates to areas with inadequate health care services.</p>
<p>&#8220;These programs are unlikely to reduce health care disparities among racial and ethic groups,&#8221; according to the draft letter obtained by The Washington Times. &#8220;A growing body of evidence indicates that increasing access to high-quality physicians  &mdash;  whatever their racial or ethnic ancestry  &mdash;  is the best way to mitigate such disparities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The draft letter also cites testimony from Dr. Amitabh Chandra of Harvard University who said the idea that expanding the number of minority physicians and providing &#8220;cultural competence training&#8221; will bridge the health status gap is &#8220;grounded in hope more than science,&#8221; according to the draft language.</p>
<p>It cites research from Dr. Chandra that found that improving the quality of health care in the 500 largest minority serving areas would improve minority health care more than the elimination of racial disparities within every provider in the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The commission, which has four Republican members appointed by President George W. Bush, as well as two independents and two Democrats appointed by Congress, has come under scrutiny in recent months by liberals who say the group hasn&rsquo;t done enough for minorities.</p>
<p>The Leadership Council on Civil Rights, a civil rights coalition of nearly 200 national groups, said the commission has become too political and, in this case, is attempting to squash equal-opportunity programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The federal government already has policies in place that target physicians to underserved areas, such as the National Health Corps, which forgives medical school debt in exchange for working in those underserved areas.</p>
<p>There are many types of underserved areas, said James D. Reschovsky, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan Center for Studying Health System Change. The definition is largely based on the number of primary care physicians per capita, and includes rural and urban regions.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you subsidize peoples&rsquo; medical education on the condition that they serve in underserved areas, that should have a beneficial effect,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m assuming that the physicians will still have to get through their medical exams and so on, so it has nothing to do with compromising the quality of care, per se.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grants and scholarships would be available from the Department of Health and Human Services to educate minority and underserved populations in public health, dentistry and health specialties, as well as to students who agree to serve in those areas of the country after graduation.</p>

I guess that &#8220;giving preferential treatment to minority students for scholarships, and about favoring medical schools and organizations that have a record&hellip;&hellip;&#8221; blah, blah, blah, is considered EQUAL OPPORTUNITY for some. Amazing after all this time that these &#8220;civil rights&#8221; folks still get away with this and are not called out on it by the media.</p>

		<p>This healthcare bill just like every other advocacy of this racist black president is designed strictly to assist blacks.</p>
<p>If it passes, and it looks as if it will, it will probably not get impletmented, because the effective date is 2013, and the country could be in the greatest depression ever at that time.</p>

		<p>So they want to force the best doctors to treat blacks even if their patient roster is full and they don&rsquo;t take new patients? Is the govt going to yank the doctor&rsquo;s license?</p>

		<p>This is one item that legitimately ought to hold up Obama&rsquo;s health care plan.  But instead, the protests focus on misinformation that is being pumped into the conservative community by insurance lobbies, and gobbled up by knee-jerk-ignorance.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t make real sense of your protest, you ought to stay home, nibble on crackers and drink your coffee in front of yout tv set.  Get out of the way and let somebody, hopefully, with some brains identify real problems in the proposed legislation.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;These programs are unlikely to reduce health care disparities among racial and ethic groups,&rdquo; </p>
<p>What if a program does &#8216;reduce racial inequalities&rsquo;? How far would they go to achieve magical &#8216;equality&rsquo;? Can anything stand in the way?</p>
<p>Soon it will be like a Star Trek movie and whites will be lined up for disposal or exile because it will be seen to reduce disparity.</p>

		<p>To #4 – funny, but I think all socialism is bad. You, Whiteplight, want to be able to decide whom you live next to yet you are willing to let a cabal in DC decide who your doctor is and when and if you get care. As far as the protestors at the townhall meetings, the one I attended included calm but nervous citizens duly concerned for their futures who, by and large, asked cogent, well reasoned questions of their elected officials. The only clips that made it on the news that evening were of those attendees who were spitting mad and couldn&rsquo;t form a balanced sentence and the local tinfoil hat contingent. Hmmm.</p>
<p>ObamaCare is a solution in search of problem.<br>
What some segments of the US population face is not a lack of quality health care but a lack of health insurance. While some people are uninsured due to unforeseen economic crisis, many are uninsured do to personal choice. As to the former – no one is turned away from a hospital emergency room do to an inability to pay or a lack of insurance, so yes, there should be some discussion vis-à-vis health insurance. For the latter I have no comment at the moment but as I have been in that situation and know what it is like, still, it is not my job to protect people from themselves.   </p>
<p>The ostensible reason for the current clamor for healthcare reform is to provide relief to the suffering. In actuality, I believe, the left&rsquo;s continual desire to accumulate power and, in turn, their ability then to warrant fiefdoms to their cohorts is their central desire. One sixth of the United States economy is a pretty juicy plum. The electorate, in their wisdom, has seen fit to install in office a super majority of, seemingly, like minded Liberal if not down left Birkenstock wearing socialists, well we&rsquo;re about to get what we deserve for years of not holding our representatives accountable for their actions. This, finally I hope, will end in the next election cycle.</p>
<p>Alas, the damage may very well have been done by then.<br>

		<p>In the UK we have a Health Insurance scheme that taxes us directly out of our paypackets, under the false pretence that when we need health treatment, we can get it free at the point of use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, under the &#8220;Labour&#8221; party, this has become somewhat restricted.</p>
<p>Whilst AIDS carriers, sex-change &#8220;patients&#8221; and others of that ilk are treated as Royalty, people who are actually coerced into pay for this Ponzi scheme (we are taxed at source of earnings), cannot register with a dentist who can or will administer any treatment above that of semi-medieval, soviet dentistry.</p>
<p>I think the system needs to be massively overhauled in order to prevent it becoming a tax mechanism against the productive with legitimate health care needs and being transferred in an <em>international heatlh service committed to treating the 3rd world and it&rsquo;s hoards of hangers-on. </em></p>
<p>Personally, I would rather see it totally abolished than to continue to be used to tax the likes of me who cannot get the treatment we are entitled to, because there are too many of the invading hoards entitling themselves to the <em>inter</em>national health service.</p>
<p>This is the legacy of New Labour - total warfare against the indigenous White working clas, because they see the aggrieved black interlopers as somehow being more entitled.</p>
<p>What this country needs is a political party with the sense to implement a <em>dirigeste</em> social command economy that is explicitly designed to defend the interests of an indigenous population that has been systematically and deliberately ridiculed and marginalised by a &#8220;liberal&#8221; elite that on the one hand would like to turn us all into &#8220;chavs&#8221;, while on the other hand, would like to offer us up as the sacrificial scapegoat to the teeming hoards of third word occupiers who in turn, have their own agenda against the best of the best of Humanity.</p>

		<p>The major reason health care costs skyrocket every year is the fact that the cost of freeloading illegals is passed on to Americans in the form of increased costs.  </p>
<p>When people&hellip; when are we going to shut down the illegals and the politicians who pander to them?  When are we going to remind government that it exists to server us and not the other way around?  </p>
<p>The federal law that dictates free medical care for was intended to apply to poor American citizens and not to parasitic illegal aliens.  We must demand that the law be made clear and do it soon&hellip;</p>
