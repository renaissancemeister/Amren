			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jan Breslauer, Los Angeles Times, August 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Seated around a large table during the first week of rehearsal for &#8220;The Night Is a Child,&#8221; director Sheldon Epps guides his actors&rsquo; investigation of a scene between an American woman and the hotel owner she encounters in Brazil. He asks them about the differences between Boston and Brazil, the grayness versus the color, and the contrasts that these first scenes must embody.</p>
<p>With a cast led by JoBeth Williams, Charles Randolph-Wright&rsquo;s &#8220;The Night is a Child&#8221; opens Friday in its West Coast premiere at the Pasadena Playhouse, where Epps is artistic director. The play revolves around the experience of Williams&rsquo; Bostonian, and that of her family, in the wake of a Columbine-style killing spree by one of her sons.</p>
<p>Key characters in this play are a white woman and her family. The director happens to be black, as does the playwright. Should it matter?</p>
<p>If the answer seems simple, recent dialogue in the theater community suggests otherwise. What Epps has created in this Pasadena rehearsal room is largely the exception. A theater that facilitates artists of any race or ethnicity working on plays about characters of any race or ethnicity is far from the norm.</p>
<p>In fact, since spring, when a revival of August Wilson&rsquo;s &#8220;Joe Turner&rsquo;s Come and Gone&#8221; opened on Broadway, the American theater has been engaged in a racially charged discussion of who should direct what. Should white artists direct plays that are black in authorship and subject? And by extension, should black  &mdash;  and Latino, Asian, mixed-race and other  &mdash;  directors be hired to stage plays written by white authors? Such are the questions being posed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The controversy was ignited when Tony-winning director Bartlett Sher was tapped to helm the Wilson revival. Wilson, who died in 2005, had insisted that only black directors stage his work. But his widow, Constanza Romero, approved the choice of Sher, who is white. This production marked the first time a Wilson play had been directed by a white director on Broadway. And black artists have voiced concern about the precedent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conversation around &#8216;Joe Turner&rsquo; has been a catalyst,&#8221; says Laura Penn, executive director of the Society of Directors and Choreographers, a union for theater artists. &#8220;Yes, there was conversation about it as an aesthetic choice, but the conversation among our members quickly moved to access and opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>No &#8216;reverse opportunity&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Randolph-Wright and Epps are among the relatively few African American theater artists who have had the chance to direct major productions of nonblack plays, including Moli√®re, Shakespeare, Stoppard, Noel Coward, Ibsen and more. Both have also worked in television; Epps directed many episodes of &#8220;Frasier&#8221; and &#8220;Friends.&#8221; And yet, despite their personal successes, they both perceive a systemic ill.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is, there is no balance,&#8221; says Randolph-Wright, who appeared in the original Broadway version of &#8220;Dreamgirls&#8221; before turning to writing and directing. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think by any means that Bart Sher can&rsquo;t direct an August Wilson play or any kind of play. But people of color don&rsquo;t get the reverse opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet because opportunities that have traditionally gone to black directors  &mdash;  such as Wilson&rsquo;s plays  &mdash;  may now be open to directors of any color is of concern to Randolph-Wright. &#8220;There was not one black director on Broadway last season,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;And the frightening thing now is, I&rsquo;m not even going to get the black project.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even at liberal theaters, black directors are typically hired to stage only black plays. This may be a holdover from 1990s multiculturalism, when it was considered politically correct to match artists with work from their own cultural origins. Today, artists reject the notion that they should be limited to working on plays about people of their own color.</p>
<p>&#8220;African American directors are often hired solely for the people-of-color slot at regional theaters, which means directing only once or twice a year,&#8221; says Nottage. &#8220;So I understand why some people are concerned when white directors begin taking the few slots reserved for people of color, but I don&rsquo;t think the answer is to create a segregated theater world but rather to figure out how to create a more inclusive one.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well I&rsquo;d ask Mr Randolph-Wright if he believes that choosing directors for white-authored-and-centered plays should be decided by merit, not race. <br>
If he answers in the affirmative, I&rsquo;d then ask:<br>
If he believes that choosing directors for minority-authored-and-centered plays should be decided by race, not merit.<br>
Should he answer in the affirmative, ladies and gentlemen we have a double standard.</p>
<p>These &#8220;black directors&#8221; want to have their cake (be able to direct white plays based on merit) and eat it too (while preventing black/minority plays from being directed by whites based on race)</p>

		<p>With as much heat as August Wilson and his plays took on this board the last time the issue came up, it&rsquo;s important to note that Wilson was consistent in his views. Not only did he want Black actors and Black directors to represent his view of the Black experience, but he also ridiculed such projects as James Earl Jones leading an all-Black cast in &#8220;Cat On A Hot Tin Roof,&#8221; saying (and I&rsquo;m paraphrasing) &#8220;That was one of the quintescential plays on the White experience, why should Blacks even attempt to tell that story? We have our own experiences to draw from, and our own stories to tell.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that although Wilson has been heralded as one of the premier Black literary voices of the 20th Century, he was the product of a Black father and a (White) German mother. For whatever reason, his success was seen as a huge step forward for Blacks&hellip;.but not so much for Whites or Germans. It&rsquo;s a good things that times have changed:)</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t blacks just amazing.</p>
<p>They insist only black people play Othello and yet want to play significant white characters.</p>
<p>They want to direct plays about white people but don&rsquo;t want whites to direct plays about blacks.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea. Lets have apartheid - they do their thing and we do ours.</p>
<p>A separation of a ocean between us would also be a good idea.</p>

		<p>All of this is known by one term- &#8216;Black face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is considered immoral for a white to pretend to be a black, and it should be JUST AS IMMORAL for a Black to pretend to be a white.</p>
<p>I am sick and tired of non-Europeans taking over vocal roles in the great Western Art Dramas known as Opera. They both look &#8216;wrong&rsquo; and often exhibit serious vocal dysfunction, simply because [white] voice teachers pretend that race differences don&rsquo;t exist in the arena of vocal music&hellip; when they do.</p>
<p>This is a cheapening, a tawdryizing of our WHite, Christian European culture. Nothing more. nothing less.</p>

		<p>To correct the previous poster August Wilson was</p>
<p> born Frederick August Kittel, Jr. in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the fourth of six children to German immigrant baker, Frederick August Kittel, Sr. and Daisy Wilson, an African American cleaning woman, from North Carolina. Earlier, Wilson&rsquo;s maternal grandmother walked from North Carolina to Pennsylvania in search of a better life. His mother raised the children alone by the time he was five in a two-room apartment above a grocery store at 1727 Bedford Avenue. The economically depressed neighborhood in which he was raised was inhabited predominantly by black Americans, and Jewish and Italian immigrants. Wilson&rsquo;s mother was remarried to David Bedford in the 1950s when he was a teen, and the family moved from the Hill to the then predominantly white working class neighborhood, Hazelwood. where they encountered racial hostility; bricks were thrown through a window at their new home. They were soon forced out of their house and on to their next home.</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with Whites directing Black plays and vice versa. The decision should be made on the best director for the job.</p>
