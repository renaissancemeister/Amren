			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk (Virginia) Examiner, August 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Investigators have determined that the wildfire burning known as the La Brea Fire, in the Los Padres National Forest, which began on August 8, was actually started by a cooking fire being used by Mexican marijuana growers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fire has now destroyed more than 130 square miles of forest and forced more than 2,000 residents from their homes.</p>
<p>While the La Brea Fire may represent the first time that the mainstream press has reported on a fire which was set by Mexican nationals, this incident is only the latest and perhaps most costly fire. However, arson has actually become a favorite tactic used by those who now regularly invade this country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The border area has become so dangerous due to Mexican drug smugglers and illegal aliens crossing into this country, that in 2007, firefighters battling wildfires in the Coronado National Forest had to be accompanied by police officers.</p>
<p>For several years, the U.S. Forest Service has reported numerous accounts of encounters with heavily armed drug dealers approaching firefighters.</p>
<p>Mexican smugglers intent on crossing the U.S. border, have now begun to set fire to forests and fields along the border to distract U.S. Border Patrol Agents to make their crossing easier. These criminal invaders are also throwing Molotov cocktails at agents&rsquo; vehicles as well as even setting fire to their observation posts. {snip}<br>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if many of the past fires in California were set by non-white mal-contents who seem to have a permanent sneer and an unending whine about whites in general, because they perceive it to be getting back at whitey.</p>
<p>So far as the fires set as a distraction or cover to divert the attention of law enforcement, well, what is to be expected when the border is left poorly guarded or mnot guarded at all in some places?</p>
<p>What still amazes me is that jihadists haven&rsquo;t trotted into this country from Mexico with the intent to blow something up. It would be so easy to do.  Probably the only reason it hasn&rsquo;t occurred is because they just aren&rsquo;t motivated to do so.</p>
<p>If terorism originating from Mexico had occurred during Bush&rsquo;s administration, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he would have been impeached after 9-11, because he adamantly refused to reinforce the border with any kind of security.</p>
<p>I doubt it will happen now, because the jihadists probably regard Obama as someone who is one of them in spirit.</p>
<p>But, as someone said a while back, a country that doesn&rsquo;t have well-defined borders that are heavily guarded isn&rsquo;t really a sovereign nation at all.  </p>
<p>These corrupt pliticians always make reference to the need to strictly enforce our laws, but they don&rsquo;t seem to mind that immigration laws aren&rsquo;t included in their ideas of law and order.</p>
<p>But, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.  We&rsquo;re on the way out anyway, and Empire America will fade away with or without the assistance of a Great Depression.  The nation has run its course, and is dying at an early age.</p>

		<p>When the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans is complete in California.. &hellip;the ecosystems of California and the species that comprise these ecosystems will be wiped out by high fertility post-1965 non-whites. Civilization will collapse in California.</p>
<p>California has to be cordoned off from the rest of the nation. Just let it rot,rot and rot some more. But there will be a problem. Even if a line in the sand is drawn, California will still be able to export its pollution and disease to the just over the boundary to the White areas of the former America.</p>
<p>I beleive that it will take the obliteration of any where between one to three large states  for Native Born White Americans to finally understand the profound statement that Dorothy uttered to her little doggy:&#8221;Toto, I don&rsquo;t think We are in Kansas anymore&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Well the obvious way to stop this nonsense is to set the drug dealers on fire. But that would be inhumane. So we will let them burn whatever they want to burn. Because we are civilized. We should prepare memorial stones that state: &#8220;We are civilized even though it caused our extinction.&#8221;</p>

		<p>  Hey Feller, it isn&rsquo;t that we are too civilized to burn the drug dealers, we are too girly girl to do it. There aren&rsquo;t many true men left in this country. The whites were told many years ago that our young men needed to get in touch with their feminine side. Now, the girls are more courageous than the boys. We are truly in big trouble as a race of people. It is up to us, the white men and women to reverse this terrible injustice. Make your boys grow up to be men. Tell the liberals and communists to go to Hell. Take control of our own destiny again. We must, as the majority in this country, shape its destiny to fit OUR needs, NOT the needs of minorities. Believew me, once we are the minority, they will show us none of the courtesies that we&rsquo;ve shown them.</p>

		<p>Our troops should be on our borders.  Why in lords name are we bringing democracy to people who don&rsquo;t want it, defending inidustrialized nations that should be defending themselves,  and putting missle installations in Warsaw block nations?</p>
<p>The purpose of our military is to defend the US against foreign invaders.  Mexico is a foreign invader.  Simple.</p>

		<p>As feller above wrote, civility is the White man&rsquo;s downfall. One can only use civility (and altruism) among ones own racial kin. To freely dish it out to nonwhites is certain death for the White race, as we now can see.</p>

<p>Ranger, this is has already happened, and continues to happen.  They are some of whom ICE refers to as &#8220;OTMs&#8221; (Other Than Mexicans). They are just waiting for the signal to attack.</p>
<p>Why they haven&rsquo;t so far is a mystery to me. It makes me wonder if this &#8220;War on Terror&#8221; isn&rsquo;t just some government inspired and controlled operation bent on stripping us of our freedoms. (Ya think?!?) But, whether or not goverment(s) or the powers-that-be or whoever are behind the terrorist threat, they just love the ability to make us cower and yell for &#8220;safety!&#8221; (and you know what Ben Franklin thought of that).</p>

		<p>And, of course, as always, silence from the Sierra Club.  Wonder if they&rsquo;ve &#8216;burned&rsquo; through their 100 million dollar donation yet (to keep their mouths shut about immigration)?</p>
<p>This is old news to us here in California  &mdash;  the papers may or may not report that mexican are setting the destructive fires.  The media often report that the fires are out of control campfires and leave it at that.  One gets the impression that it&rsquo;s perhaps a troop of Girl or Boy Scouts or someone driving an RV (White, of course).</p>
<p>The fires are super destructive not only to the surrounding homeowners in the areas (who often return to find their homes robbed) but to the forests themselves.  You see, S. California is very dry with little rainfall  &mdash;  even in the mountain areas  &mdash;  and the trees take a very long time to either recover or grow back.  When coupled with  hot, dry Santa Ana winds, the fires are doubly destructive, spread quickly, jump freeways, ignite rooftops with sparks carried by the wind and send huge plumes of smoke and ash into the air.  No word from Air Quality Control (AQMD) either, silenced by PC.  Meanwhile, your car is covered in acidic ashes that will eat through the paint.</p>
<p>One of my relatives finally sold his house at Lake Arrowhead because a fire had swept through the area about a decade ago and burned up all the trees.  Even after 10 years, the area still looked like a burned-out moonscape. The rangers told him it could take up to a century and probably longer for a dry forest to recover.</p>
<p>These unwelcome mexican interlopers are also the reason I can no longer walk my dogs on the fire trails above my house.  Several women have been raped and assaulted in my county and the neighboring county by hispanic men that jumped out of  bushes. These are areas of multi-million dollar estate-type homes.  Is it any wonder that people here are hunkering down behind 9-foot walls, some topped with cameras?  Yeah, great quality of life  &mdash;  I need to arm myself just to walk my dogs around my neighborhood.  Is this South Africa or the United States?   And What&rsquo;s the Difference?</p>
<p>We are getting reports (that are difficult to find) that the mexican cartels are bankrolling politicians here in California, city by city.  I suspect they&rsquo;ll own the politicians in Sacramento as well at some point, perhaps they already do.  After all, they&rsquo;re allowed to operate here with impunity and immunity  &mdash;  and if YOU complain, the $PLC, the ADL and La Raza will threaten your livelihood.</p>
<p>And the mexican criminals know it  &mdash;  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if THEY were funding the $PLC, ADL, La Raza&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Istvan is correct, we shouldn&rsquo;t be tweaking the noses of the Russians by interfering in their business. If you recall, it was JFK&rsquo;s poorly-considered introduction of missiles in Turkey that led directly to the Cuban Missile Crisis. We were a heartbeat away from total annihilation and it could happen again. </p>

<p>My personal opinion as to why jihadists haven&rsquo;t hit the US since 9/11 is that they are too busy kicking our butts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  9/11 lured us onto their home field, where it is easier to fight us. That was bin Laden&rsquo;s plan all along.</p>
<p>As long as they can fight us on their own turf, they don&rsquo;t want to do anything to anger the American population and stiffen our resolve. </p>
<p>Once we leave Iraq and it descends back into normal Moslem chaos, and once we tire of the casualties in Afghanistan and bring our troops home, however, then they&rsquo;ll resume attacking us on our own soil.</p>

<p>I think your theory that the paranoia-industrial complex and certain liberal civil rights groups getting funding from Mexican drug gangs might well be true.  I also tend to think that the ACLU is getting Arab terrorist money.  Of course they wouldn&rsquo;t be getting it directly.  It would have to be laundered 50 ways to Sunday bewtween AQ/MS-13 and ACLU/SPLC.  However, I think the preference that the ACLU and SPLC indirectly shows for Arab terrorist suspects and Mexican drug gangs is good enough circumstantial evidence for me.</p>

		<p>As every day goes by, I have less and less respect for European Americans. My God, President Theodore Roosevelt protected large areas in the U.S. known as national parks, for the benefit and enjoyment of future Americans. Being a nature lover himself, and believing in the idea that hiking and fishing and hunting, etc. would be of benefit to Americans, he put this land aside more than 100 years ago. How do most Americans thank him? By allowing Mexican pot growers, grow marijuana in those beautiful forersts and run around with AK-47&rsquo;s ready to kill anyone who comes upon their cache. Is it entirely unreasonable to sometimes feel that we Americans don&rsquo;t deserve this land, because we demonstrate repeatedly that we don&rsquo;t value it  &mdash;  at all. If we do, we sure as hell have a funny way of showing it.</p>

		<p>Ranger, before Ranch Rescue&rsquo;s site was shut down, you could go there and see postcards from Cairo that were found among the mountains of litter that illegals left behind on their trek into this country.</p>
<p>So jihadists are already here.  And you&rsquo;re right.  If they had wanted to blow something up (yet), they would have done so.</p>
