		<p>Come this December the odd&rsquo;s of him saying the word CHRISTMAS will be several times greater than your odd&rsquo;s of hitting a mega million&rsquo;s lotto. I now refuse to shop in store&rsquo;s after Dec 1st for the sole purpose of not having to reply to some moronic store cashier wishing me a Happy Holiday. I would prefer they say nothing. It becomes so infuriating to have to put up with this INSULT year after year. If everybody stayed away for that month you can bet things would change.</p>

<p>Our &#8216;leaders&rsquo; have no business endorsing any religion.  Nor should they consult religious &#8216;leaders&rsquo; when shaping public policy.  How many decades are we away, now, from Sharia Law?</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t take this too seriously. Bush did the same thing. I&rsquo;m not supporting Obama, I&rsquo;m simply saying this is all a part of the elite&rsquo;s plans, required of him, as it was of Bush and others, and has to do with the mess that we are in, in the middle east. The plans of these traitorous elites, however, are going to go nowhere but down, in my opinion. Unfortunately, it may take us along.</p>

<p>As someone who has worked on the front lines of retail, I URGE you NOT to take it out on the employees. They are only doing what they are required to do to keep their jobs. They are victims.</p>
<p>I have had to deal with many an angry customer and have been helpless to respond. You have to do as management says or lose your job. You can&rsquo;t fight, argue, or even AGREE with the customer.</p>
<p>I would say call the number on the receipt to complain but the people on the line are just as helpless to respond or do anything.<br>

Tolerance- Death to the Jews and other Infidel dogs.<br>
Dignity- Beheading Danny Pearle via web cam with audio so that we could hear his screams and publicly beheading and/or stoning their woman for showing their ankles. Performing sexual mutilation on young girls.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a seperation of church and state? I guess not.  This is so sad, like he is groveling to the moslems. Why should we care about them? Outside of the oil in the ground, they are worthless.<br>
   Now I want to see moslem leaders wish us a Merry Christmas in December.</p>

		<p>Great White Observer and Bobby,<br>
 First Great White, I agree with your sentiment there but I still shop, I just respond with Merry Christmas it might make them rethink the error of their ways., and Bobby,good point, but I think we do have to take it very seriously just because it is part of the elites plan, Bush was a toady to this One World Order in a similar way to Obama.  <br>
What is going on here is a not so subtle change of the language; Islamic words being introduced to bring familiarity with these terms to our children, Ramadan becomes just another everyday word as familiar and non threatening as words like Christmas and Hanukah. But of course we all know the threat that accommodating familiarity with Ramadan brings because its practitioners have not hidden their agenda; (or as they see it their divinely inspired mission to Islamify the world).</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m on the topic of language manipulation I expect you have all heard the Obama inspired alteration of our language with regard to 9/11 remembrance.  If he has his way we will refer to that date as a &#8216;Day of Service&rsquo;. No connection whatsoever with Islamic terrorists, murderous attacks, day of infamy, death of our citizens, Moslem worldview or Islamists hatred of America. No just a Day of Service. How nice! Why question that? And let&rsquo;s face it probably makes those Islamists feeeeeel a lot better, why keep rubbing it in. The next generation of Americans will probably not even question it anyway; they&rsquo;ll be too busy marching in Obamas civilian army.</p>

		<p>Our affirmative action nignog is merely playing out the game prepared for him by his organ grinders.  His ignorance and gullibility, however, are going to get americans killed.  All the muzzies are going to see in him is either a &#8220;brother&#8221; corrupted by the western infidels or a weak fool that they can exploit.  And exploit him they will.  Wait until fall when the health care &#8220;reform&#8221; bill gets compromised, and we end up with sharia compliant, single payer health care for all.  The single payer will be all of us infidel dhimmies.</p>

<p>nope, sorry uh-unh.</p>
<p>America was founded as a CHristian Republic. <br>
Her 13 Colonies&rsquo; charters all began with a profession of the Trinity.<br>
The Supreme Court in the 19th Century clearly said &#8216;This is a Christian nation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps as a member of &#8220;his people&#8221; Barry Baby can do whatever he likes. As an icon (however &#8216;darkly viewed&rsquo; - allusions to &#8216;we see through a mirror darkly,&rsquo; you understand!) of that Christian America, he continues to blaspheme and act the traitor; the first, to God- the second, to the American People, past and present.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster # 9. I also believe that the Founders in no way intended this nation to become a nation of DIFFERENT religions, only different sects of Christianity was their intention. They would also turn in their graves when that Immigration Act of 65 was passed. </p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s insulting to Muslims to not go over there and celebrate in person, to their point of view. The arrogance of the West, and the half-white man, is on display. He needs to be there for the entire month.</p>

<p>Treasury Department Statement Marking the Beginning of Ramadan<br>

U.S. Treasury Department ^ | August 26, 2009 | U.S. Treasury Department<br>
As Ramadan begins, the U.S. Department of the Treasury recognizes the particular importance of charitable giving throughout the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims in America and around the world. Charitable giving is a fundamental characteristic of many faiths, and zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam, is a sacred obligation for Muslims. Treasury underscores its support for the important work of the charitable sector in providing essential services to those in need, both at home and abroad. Treasury remains committed to strengthening its engagement with the donor community and the charitable sector to support their efforts while at&hellip;</p>

		<p>At face value, there is little in this Ramadam message to find fault with; however, as one of the respondents suggested, let&rsquo;s see if he (Obama) will wish us all a blessed Christmas when the season comes around (as members of his own faith); why stop with the Muslim community (and our &#8220;Service Day&#8221; commemorating acts of terror by Muslim fanatics)? Why not give his blessing to all faiths (at the appropriate time), to wit: Buddhists (quite a few now in America), Shintoists, Hindus (whose numbers rapidly grow as we speak), and at least mention Santeria (with animal sacrifices) and voodoo that come to us from our Caribbean and Brazilian immigrants.  We are no longer (to quote Obama&rsquo;s Egyptian discourse) a Christian nation!  Halleluja!! Let&rsquo;s jettison the last chains of slavery and colonialism and set our non-European citizens free, free at last from the constraints of Christian ethics!  Peace treaties are not negotiated by pretty words, but by harsh and courageous acts.  One cannot pronounce peace and have the seas part and the skies become radiant with God&rsquo;s will&hellip;. I will be awaiting his extended Christmas address on national TV&hellip;</p>
