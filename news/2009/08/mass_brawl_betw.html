			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Wilkes, Daily Mail (London), August 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Down on his knees as his attackers&rsquo; feet fly in, this man&rsquo;s face was left a bloodied mess.</p>
<p>It was just one of the sickening scenes photographed when a riot erupted in a city centre after Right-wing protesters clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators.</p>
<p>Police knew both demonstrations were planned and let them go ahead as a sign of &#8216;a healthy democracy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Witness Gary Nichols said: &#8216;It started off with a group of white guys who were chanting, &#8220;England, England&#8221;. I thought they were just football fans, but then a larger group of black and Asian people turned up and it all kicked off. You had people burning the Union flag. People were being kicked, some weren&rsquo;t anything to do with the protests.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rival groups had each held peaceful protests at different ends of the city centre before the trouble flared at around 7pm on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Right-wing protesters were from the English and Welsh Defence League, formed after British soldiers were abused by Islamic radicals at a homecoming parade in Luton earlier this year.</p>
<p>Their critics say they include soccer hooligans intent on inciting violence.</p>
<p>They claim to be a &#8216;multicultural organisation against militant Islam&rsquo; which has &#8216;no issues with Muslims who wish us no harm&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Unite Against Fascism group meanwhile is an umbrella organisation formed by the Anti-Nazi League and the National Assembly Against Racism in response to the rising electoral threat of the BNP.</p>
<p>On its website it urged people to join the protest to &#8216;show these thugs their brand of vicious racism is not wanted&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Chaos erupted when the opposing factions clashed in New Street, which runs between where the respective protests where held.</p>
<p>Shopper Emily Bridgewater said: &#8216;There was stampeding and screaming. We ended up being locked in Primark, the shutters came down and the alarms went off as the riot police tried to regain control of the street.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At least three people were injured before the worst of the violence was brought under control by 8.30pm.</p>
<p>Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood questioned the wisdom of allowing the two protests to be held simultaneously. He said: &#8216;Certainly if there was going to be rallies by both these groups at the same time it would always lead to confrontation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Police were aware the Right-wing protest had been planned through social networking sites but said no formal request to march was submitted. They had however been in talks with the UAF about its demonstration.</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Mark Payne said: &#8216;It is important to be aware we have no powers to ban or stop peaceful protests and would not seek to do so.</p>
<p>&#8216;However, if criminal acts or racially aggravated incidents are reported, then police will arrest and prosecute anyone responsible.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;a riot erupted in a city centre after Right-wing protesters clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators.&rsquo; Protesters vs. Demonstrators: who gets the implied blame for the trouble? The press knows the blacks and asians started the violence, but the &#8220;Right wing&#8221; war veterans actually FOUGHT BACK! There will be an investigation, and the leftist will claim they were attacked&hellip; and the media will agree.</p>

		<p>As bad as it is here with the spineless white authorities, it pales to the thought police all over Europe who care not one whit if their people are assaulted, mobbed and beaten.</p>
<p>Ironically, it is just that kind of white attitude that is going to doom even more rioting and out-of-control conflicts.</p>
<p>So long as the authorities refuse to control these third world hordes with an iron hand, the worse the situation will get, and these same white authorities will be the first to feel the wrath of the brown mobs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s known as true justice, because it is they who caused it all to begin with. </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to point out that just doing one&rsquo;s job hasn&rsquo;t been a legitimate excuse for about 65 years now.</p>

		<p>That article is a deliberate distortion of what happened. </p>
<p>Down on his knees as his attackers&rsquo; feet fly in, this man&rsquo;s face was left a bloodied mess.</p>
<p>It was just one of the sickening scenes photographed when a riot erupted in a city centre after Right-wing protesters clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators</p>
<p>Look at the wording of that, it implies that it was the anti immigration protestors who did it, but there are photos of the incident available for people to find. A white man was bashed by several pakistani guys and had the union jack ripped out of his hand. Only white people were attacked, only white people had bottles and pieces of wood thrown at them. </p>
<p>The media has no intentions of reporting this however. They will deliberately distort the reality of what happened, in order to serve their political purposes.</p>

<p>It looks like the white guys are outnumbered by the browns.  With expected results.</p>
<p>Yet, I take heart at this news.  The fight-back has to start somewhere and it looks like that somewhere may have been Birmingham.  I hope and pray that this grows, both in incidents and members.  It looks like the Brits are starting to do the math of demographics and not liking the results.  It is nature and darwin.  Only the strong survive and only the brave have a homeland to call their own.  If the Brits do not fight, eventually they will be slaughtered.  That is also true for North America.</p>

		<p>This incident sounds just like Germany in the 1930&rsquo;s, where groups of left, right and others would clash violently. Politics seemed to degenerate into warring bands of street armies. <br>
The &#8220;town hall&#8221; meetings are starting to look like this as well. <br>
Do not retreat. Do not surrender. Surrender is death for the nation. Be prepared. Be brave. </p>

<p>Do your own search and read the article.  One has a You Tube of Islam guys burning the Flag of the St. George Cross.  Read what they wrote on the flag of England and listen to what they say.  This is real, this is here, this is now.</p>

<p>Reminds me of hearing a lifetime of labor strife reports in the news and then later hearing about it in college. 100% of the time it was nasty brutality attributed to aggressive security guards hired by the company. There was actually a labor strike in the town where I live a few years ago and almost all of the attacks and vandalism were instigated by the employees on strike.</p>

		<p>   Harvey, I agree with you completely.  But I&rsquo;m afraid it may be too late for the United States.  Unfortunately, whites here in the states won&rsquo;t fight back. We are doomed. I sure hope the Brits will regain their country. The police chief in Birmingham is a muslim? Well, so is our president.</p>

		<p>Maybe now we are seeing signs of hope. A few brave white guys, outnumbered and ultimately beaten, stood together and fought for their land and people. Heroes every one, and should be honored as such, not unlike the brave warrior pilots of 1940 England and honored as such by Winston Churchill when he said, &#8221; Never in the course of human events have so many owed so much to so few&#8221;.  These young men are the &#8220;few&#8221; of our times, fighting together not only against the invaders but also have to fight against the corrupt oppresive government that has become the representative captor of the British peoples. Lets all be proud of and  encourage with all possible means these young unbrainwashed heroes, after all, they, along with the BNP are the &#8220;few&#8221; of our time. Kingfish         </p>

		<p>Looks like people were beating up BNP supporters. Those on the fence are even more dangerous. To be honest, false flag comments posted places like Youtube by &#8216;right wing&rsquo; supporters can seem kind of primitive. These folks believe they are fighting a Nazi-mentality and they need to win. Therefore they believe using Nazi like tactics of intimidation and disinformation are a necessary way to fight. These people run &#8216;our&rsquo; schools and especially our media outlets.</p>

		<p>I was there and we were seriously outnumbered. Apparently there were two home football (soccer) games. One being Birmingham city the other being Aston Villa. This accounts for the lack of numbers. It is a good start though, the atmosphere in the air was if your white watch your back, hopefully woke a few people up. </p>

		<p>1. The MP for the area is named Khalid Mahmood? No wonder England is on the verge of extinction.</p>
<p>2. The blacks and Asians were the ones, I assume, who burned the Union Jack. Flag burning laws are not foolish. Burning a flag is an attack on the government and on the people of the UK. It shows contempt for 1500 years of British history. The blacks and Asians should be in jail. The Chief Inspector babbles about peaceful protest. Flag burning is not peaceful at all.</p>

		<p> As our enemies occupy the moral high ground  &mdash;  according to the controlled media  &mdash;  we must always wait for them to strike the first blow. The most effective tactic for our side is to passively let the &#8220;anti-fascists&#8221; make fools of themselves by shouting down speakers, pushing, throwing bottles, swearing, etc. Remain calm and respectable this is the English tradition. As more people see through these idiot multicultural phonies, the more people will come over to the BNP.</p>

		<p>The group who had the prostest, the EDL, makes a big show about being anti-racist.    They clain to be anti-BNP and only against &#8220;radical Islam.&#8221;  They supposedly have a couple of black members too.  However, the local blacks weren&rsquo;t impressed and attacked them anyway.  One of the young white men who was beaten unconcious by the blacks also had his wallet stolen.  The video is on youtube.  </p>

<p>We have 646 MPs (!) - overwhelmingly white. England is not on the verge of extinction. In spite of what you read, the problems are confined to specific areas.  Yes, we have serious problems but many areas have changed surprisingly little. &#8220;Minorities&#8221; are still a minority and whites are at last showing signs of waking up.</p>
<p>Flag burning is not a big issue over here, as it is in the US. We actually have several flags and burning them is not illegal. We focus on the Monarchy rather than the flag.</p>

		<p>This is good news.  Violence in the street makes a powerful impression on witnesses.  Most Whites are aware enough of the non-White menace to try to keep some distance, but all the media and the political establishment tells them they&rsquo;re wrong, so Whites will keep their opinions to themselves.  But to see Whites like yourself attacked by foreigners, to see the hatred face to face, is much harder to ignore.  Almost every one of the Whites who saw this told everyone they knew, told it with fervor, and did not back down when anyone made excuses for the aliens.  People love to tell stories, and love attentive listeners.   &#8220;I saw it myself&#8221; trumps any diversity talk.  And when they turned on the news and saw that the story was ignored or misreported, they&rsquo;ll tell their friends about that too.  </p>
<p>BTW, do White &#8220;anti-fascists&#8221; or &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; ever riot with their non-White comrades, or are they afraid to be there when their pets slip the leash?  </p>

<p>Even if it&rsquo;s not illegal in the UK it is galling for Black/Asian people to come to another country and burn their flag and it is extremely disrepectful. Imagine what would happen if a White did the same in THEIR countries? The White, especially in Muslim countries would likely be seriously injured or killed.</p>
