			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Pierson, Los Angeles Times, August 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Welcome to IKEA Beijing, where the atmosphere is more theme park than store.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Every weekend, thousands of looky-loos pour into the massive showroom to use the displays. Some hop into bed, slide under the covers and sneak a nap; others bring cameras and pose with the decor. Families while away the afternoon in the store for no other reason than to enjoy the air conditioning.</p>
<p>Visitors can&rsquo;t seem to resist novelties most Americans take for granted, such as free soda refills and ample seating. They also like the laid-back staffers who don&rsquo;t mind when a child jumps on a couch.</p>
<p>Purchasing anything at Yi Jia, as the store is called here, can seem like an afterthought.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the only big store in Beijing where a security guard doesn&rsquo;t stop you from taking a picture,&#8221; said Jing Bo, 30, who was looking for promising backdrops for a photograph of his girlfriend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Imagining the possibilities here is one of the reasons Bai Yalin drove an hour and a half from her apartment to spend a day at the store with her 7-year-old son and two teenage nieces. There are few other indoor spaces, she said, where she can entertain the children free on an oppressive summer afternoon.</p>
<p>Bai mapped out a five-hour outing. First, they had hot dogs and soft ice cream cones at noon. Then they enjoyed a long rest lounging on the beds. Bai kicked off her sandals and sprawled out on a Tromso bunk bed. The 36-year-old homemaker made herself comfortable and even answered passing shoppers&rsquo; questions about the quality of the mattress.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s soft and a great buy at this price,&#8221; she told a young woman, pointing to a dangling price tag.</p>
<p>After that, Bai and her family took group pictures. By 5 p.m., it was time for another meal, so they headed to the cafeteria and ate braised mushrooms with rice.</p>
<p>Bai and her husband, a clerk at a heating company, have bought plates and cups at IKEA, but what they&rsquo;d really like one day is to rid themselves of their clunky old Chinese furniture and bring on the do-it-yourself particleboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we didn&rsquo;t plan to buy anything, just eat and rest,&#8221; Bai said.</p>
<p>Many others arrive with the same intentions, sometimes bringing a book to read on a bouncy Poang armchair or carrying stuffed toys for their children to play with on a mattress. For the midday squatters, the abundance of seating is no small detail in a country of 1.3 billion where nabbing a subway or bus seat is practically a blood sport.</p>
<p>The store&rsquo;s nerve center is the cafeteria. The lunch hour is an endurance contest. Hungry customers pace the dining room balancing overflowing trays, ready to pounce the second a table becomes available.</p>
<p>Beijingers have scarfed down their fair share of Swedish meatballs. Most, however, seem to favor Chinese food such as marinated pork belly with tofu.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>IKEA has the added challenge of copycats. Brazen customers are known to come in with carpenters armed with measuring tapes to make replicas. Zhang, the office manager visiting with his family, said he bought a TV table and a couch elsewhere that looked just like IKEA furniture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why spend so much money when you can have the same thing cheaper?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Others take pictures of the displays to learn how to decorate their homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew you could just screw a shelf onto the wall,&#8221; said Fan Haiying, 29, contemplating how to store her books and photographs. &#8220;Traditional Chinese furniture always needs a cabinet door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there are the amateur photographers who revel in the store&rsquo;s ambience. To them, consumerism never looked so fine through a viewfinder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On another day, He Peng showed up with his compact Sony digital camera, which he uses to snap Beijing&rsquo;s modern landmarks. He shot the Bird&rsquo;s Nest Olympic stadium and the Apple Store in a tony outdoor shopping mall, then set his sights on IKEA.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He photographed his friends beating each other with stuffed toys. Then he methodically went through the store, snapping away at beds, kitchen counters and even the extra-long hot dogs at the snack bar.</p>
<p>He posted the photos on his blog, at photo.blog.sina.com.cn/biohazardhp.</p>
<p>His caption above a shot of IKEA products reads, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t need to buy them because I have pictures.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Much of IKEA&rsquo;s stuff is made in China.  Why buy through IKEA when you can buy even cheaper directly from the factory?</p>

		<p>This sounds like IKEA&rsquo;s problem.  Apparently, Chinese stores don&rsquo;t put up with this, but as long as IKEA will, the Chinese will take advantage of it.  There&rsquo;s no reason to fault them, they&rsquo;re behaving according to their own inclinations in their own country.  And copying the dimensions of furniture is no different than browsing a bookstore and writing down the titles to buy on Amazon, for a lower price.  It&rsquo;s sneaky and cheap, but plenty of literate Whites do it.   </p>

		<p>Incredibly bizarre. I never associated this kind of &#8220;take advantage of the system&#8221; mentality with China. This kind of &#8220;something for nothing&#8221; mentality seems far more characteristic of Africa and Africans than the Chinese. Could so many years of Communism have caused this kind of degradation?</p>

		<p>Actually I think this is kinda a cute slice of life story.  I suppose most Chinese do not have home AC and China does have warm summers (parts of China are tropical).  This is similar to US Malls where kids hang out.  If the store officials allow it then why not.  But I would bet that the Chinese are less likely to break and steal the displays and are probably not overly rowdy like certain members of our society.</p>

		<p>I visited Ikea Beijing at the behest of one of my students. The place was packed, with what I would call yuppy couples.  I recall the stuffy atmosphere as the mass of people overpowered any air conditioning.  My student was determined to purchase a gift from that store because of its reputation.  I simply observed a large store selling many objects I did not need.  But a store filled to the brim with customers, for the Chinese were wild for the place.  After walking through the huge store I sat down at a display table, for I needed a rest.  No photo was taken.  Chinese went a great distance to get into this store.  You might say they waited several generations for an Ikea-type store.  If it were not not profitable, the store would close.  Some may come to camp for the day, but surely many are buying and making Ikea an icon in China.   &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  Hugh Murray</p>

		<p>Well I know from living in Shanghai for a few years what a zoo Ikea can turn into at times. If I had to go I would wait until I had a chance to go mid-week during working hours sometime.</p>

Could so many years of Communism have caused this kind of degradation?&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of people put the blame on confucianism in that they claim the Chinese will only look after their immediate family circle - anything outside of that circle is either an obstacle, or can be looted and pillaged from at will to benefit those within the circle without any feelings of guilt or remorse. I haven&rsquo;t read into it enough myself, but there is definitely a very strong, omnipresent culture of self-entitlement in China. </p>
<p>As for the IPR issue, I think this quote about sums up the way of thinking in China:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they increase IPR protections, this is of no benefit to China, only to foreign copyright-holders. If they go and protect these, then China&rsquo;s own IPR sector will not be allowed to develop and become competitive.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>In a country with a population of 1.3 billion (only 90% of which is han chinese, I would remind you) there is always going to be that bottom 10%.  With a large population, that bottom 10% is a naturally going to be larger as well.</p>

		<p>I fail to see what is so horrible about this, they aren&rsquo;t destroying anything, causing problems, scaring away customers or being an annoyance in other ways.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just overdoing it a bit.<br>
Many people go to IKEA to look at the displays, and the furniture is placed there so you can sit in them, to try them out, the display stuff isn&rsquo;t the stuff that is sold anyways. And they are actually buying stuff.<br>
And they are hanging out in the place like a mall, and they are buying lots of things in the cafeteria, which is owned by IKEA.</p>
<p>They are merely treating the place like a mall, instead of like a single store, but they are providing business, and not causing problems, so there is no reason to complain about it&hellip;.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  - I think I know why they do this.  They know Ikea is an American company.  They know they can&rsquo;t get away with this stuff with Chinese companies.  Oh by the way, the Chinese are not as cognitively elite as you might think.  Don&rsquo;t believe that media hype that they&rsquo;re smarter than Whites due to their scores on intelligence tests here in the US.  Those are just the students here.  We landed on the moon.  We crossed the Atlantic to settle a new continent.  Whites are responsible for the vast majority of scientific advancements in the 19th and 20th Centuries.  Chinese are here spying on us.  Whites are cognitively elite.  We do have some weakness though, but they aren&rsquo;t intellectual.</p>

		<p>Lots of people in the US go into furniture stores for decorating ideas.  But most US furniture stores would NOT allow people to lie down on a bed or sofa for more than a few moments without a salesperson trotting over to permanently interrupt your peaceful rest.  And many stores that I have been in have signs asking people to keep their kids off the furniture, or there are no mattresses on the displayed beds, etc.</p>
<p>Getting under the covers and staying there all afternoon is icky, and bringing a book to read for hours while sitting in a chair in the air conditioning is abusive.  If YOU are sitting in the chair for hours, nobody else can try it out, and some of the others who might have tried it out might actually have been seriously looking for a chair to buy.  When people buy a bed or sofa, they want it to be &#8220;new.&#8221;  The Ikea store that I used to live near had a fantastic childcare area where your kids could stay while you shopped.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the Chinese decided ahead of time not to incorporate that feature in the Chinese stores.   </p>
<p>I wonder if the IKEA in China will actually stay in business, or if they will end up adopting the no-photography/no loitering of all of the other stores in China.  </p>

		<p>IKEA is a Swedish company.</p>
<p>Google IKEA.  I thought it was worth a read.  Quoting from:</p>
<p>&#8220;IKEA was founded in 1943 by Ingvar Kamprad in Sweden and is owned by a Dutch-registered foundation controlled by the Kamprad family.</p>
<p>IKEA is an acronym comprising</p>
<p>IK  the initials of the founders name (Ingvar Kamprad)</p>
<p>E   the farm where he grew up (Elmtaryd)</p>
<p>A   and the name of his home parish  (Agunnaryd, in Smaland, in South Sweden).&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that it is of any interest, the combined Swiss/Swedish engineering company, ABB, has been doing business in China since 1904.</p>

		<p>Sounds like a good day out to me.  I have to admit that I tend to do the same kind of thing in Borders   &mdash;   sit on the comfy chairs in the cafe nursing a hot choc and reading a book for hours.  It&rsquo;s a great pleasure, and if you have a small child and matching small income, it can be a much-needed refuge and respite.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get so worked up about the Chinese.  They&rsquo;re just people, too.</p>
