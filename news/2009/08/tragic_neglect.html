<h1>Tragic Neglect of Immigration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rudy Ruizm, CNN, August 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the greatest challenges for minorities in any democracy is that their priorities often differ with those of the majority.</p>
<p>Consequently, even if a minority group does not experience outright tyranny, it can suffer tragic neglect. That&rsquo;s the lingering problem with immigration reform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Instead, why don&rsquo;t we step up as a nation and face the challenge with a level of honor and attention that is consistent with the best of our ideals? After all, the Statue of Liberty raised its torch to welcome immigrants, not to light the way for the insurance executives and Wall Street bankers prioritized by policymakers today.</p>
<p>I grew up on the border and I can honestly say, it pains me to watch us squander billions on a border fence when we&rsquo;ve yet to see a man-made structure that can stop the forces of nature. What we call &#8220;immigration&#8221;  &mdash;  in the case of Latinos  &mdash;  is actually a pattern of migration, a natural movement of homo sapiens dying of thirst and hunger, seeking water and nourishment in more fertile grounds.</p>
<p>Comprehensive immigration reform should thus be viewed as an essential measure to protect human rights on our soil and continent. This is a time to think big, not small. This is about more than laws and lines drawn on a map.</p>
<p>It is about the origins of our humanity, not our nationality. Real people are suffering as raids continue, border deaths and hate crimes escalate, and families are destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a solution, the problems will only worsen,&#8221; I was told by Salvador Sanabria, executive director of El Rescate, a non-profit serving immigrants in Los Angeles, California, for 27 years. &#8220;Comprehensive reform will save lives, keep families together and give immigrants the opportunity to contribute fully to America&rsquo;s economy and security. It&rsquo;s a humanitarian issue, but it&rsquo;ll also benefit America to do it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In that spirit, we should unite to make this not only a Latino priority, but an American priority. And all people of good conscience should speak up for what&rsquo;s right  &mdash;  or risk creeping towards tyranny by neglect.<br>

<p>How about fighting to protect human rights in Mexico so their peons don&rsquo;t have to flee the country to find work?</p>
<p>I mean, is there something wrong with asking a nation to be responsible?  And is there something wrong with asking them to take responsibility for encouraging human waves to inundate another nation and pay for them while they&rsquo;re here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say if people who advocate bringing in every bit of the world&rsquo;s rabble are smart enough to understand that highlighting the injustices of the countries they come from is far better than wringing our hands over somebody else&rsquo;s problem.</p>

		<p>What this writer and others on the left want is an overwhelming Democrat party supermajority.  This has nothing to do with human migration.  The question that must be asked is why is Mexico, with it&rsquo;s rich natural resources, so utterly corrupt that it refuses to deal with it&rsquo;s poor citizens.  </p>

		<p>We are an Anglo Saxon nation. We are invaded by Latino illegals. Their values are not our values. As any invaders, they must be stopped. We have a right to kill them at the border, imprison them and their employers, and kick their kids out of our schools. This traitor writer of CNN should be put in prison for treason. He love the enemy.  He should never see the light of day.</p>

<p>If there is any neglect or even outright tyranny in this country, it is excruciatingly evident that it is directed at the horrifyingly besieged and exponentially dwindling white majority.

They are alien; they are hateful; and they are utterly incompatible with a civilized country, or the decent white people who build such.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the lingering problem with immigration, or any other nonwhite franchise of any kind, here in the USA!</p>

<p>No, immigration was very strictly controlled in the past. It had to be legal and there were strict quotas on amounts as well as the type of immigrants. Anybody not meeting these requirements was sent back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Real people are suffering as raids continue, border deaths and hate crimes escalate, and families are destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about the Americans who are suffering from the crimes committed by these lawbreakers, suffering from overcrowded hosptials, some having to close and schools crowded to the gills and having their social services drained to provide for foreign nationals at their expense, losing jobs to foreign nataionals etc.? These illegal migrants wouldn&rsquo;t be suffering if they stayed home.</p>

		<p>What leftists, such as the above writer, fail to realize is that a nation is defined by the people who comprise it - those who live in it.  A &#8220;nation&#8221; is not just a territory outlined on a map and a population of people creates its own destiny, opportunity and fortune.  In the eyes of leftists, populations are passive victims of their circumstances, &#8220;nation&#8221; has no real meaning (other than government) and there is no value to human biodiversity.  No wonder they come up with such outlandish ideas!</p>

		<p>Well if all this wanton &#8220;immigration&#8221; is so good, let&rsquo;s just open the darn flood gates and let in everyone from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, the Phillipines, Cambodia, Somalia, the Congo, Nigeria, Laos, China and every other corner of the globe where third-worlders are running amuck.  Then all these parasites could add to our economy and security and all become good law-abiding citizens who embrace the American dream.  Afterall they are just as hungry and thirsty as the Mexicans.  What the heck if 20 million illegals are so good for us then 3 billion must be wonderful.</p>

		<p>With the increase in White man/Asian woman, White woman/black man coupling, along with the declining White birthrate (and, of course, increased non-White immigration, legal and illegal), the USA will soon be unrecognizable. Whites will drop below 50% within 15 years.  Will we then be a &#8220;minority&#8221; and be eligible for these programs?  Don&rsquo;t hold your breath. </p>

		<p>Third-world immigration is justified as necessary to ensure western cultures are more diverse so that they can function smoothly. That&rsquo;s akin to backing up the toilet, scooping up all the smelly refuse, and then spraying it all over your living room in order to &#8216;diversify&rsquo; the boring monochrome decor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad third-worlders have a lower standard of living than us first-worlders. But whose fault is that? I know that the wild hares bouncing around my neighborhood have to suffer through cold winters exposed to nature&rsquo;s elements, and that they don&rsquo;t share in my material comforts. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I open my house up and let them come in, mess up my floors, and chew my furniture. I recognize that we&rsquo;re just different, and that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>I wonder if the liberal lefties would understand the points I&rsquo;m trying to make via these analogies? Nah&hellip; like anyone who criticizes their narrow world view, I&rsquo;m just plain racist, right?<br>

		<p>The only way they could make the first amnesty abomination pass, was to include the promise that it would be a &#8216;one time deal&rsquo;, one that would never, ever, be repeated again. And so we made a deal with the devil and sacrificed our morals in exchange for the easy lie.  What a price we pay, everyday, for that lapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without a solution, the problems will only worsen,&rdquo; I was told by Salvador Sanabria&#8221;</p>
<p>So Salvador, let&rsquo;s say we repeat that first mistake, only this time instead of one million criminals, we forgive 20 million criminals. What is your &#8216;solution&rsquo; for with dealing with the next 20 million?   *crickets*</p>

<p>True assessment and reasonable. But asking has gotten us nowhere. Neither mexico or their citizens have ever demonstrated the slightest intention of being reasonable or responsible. Why would any stand and fight for their rights at home when they can simply steal what they want from us? As feller wrote at 6:52, that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s done. Enforcement. And it&rsquo;s really the only moral response. Any hope that they might someday  pick up the mantle of responsibility at home will only happen when we make certain we keep them there. IMO, shutting off all the magnets and sealing the border would be the best solution for the citizens of both nations.</p>
<p>Amnesty? Never.    </p>

		<p>This has to be one of the most nauseating spiels on immigration that I have read in a long time.  Every point made is based on emotion, guilt, or some other glandular outpouring.  As for the logic or consequences of &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; the author was incapable of writing those down.</p>
<p>This type of approach will become very familiar to us again in the future when Barak Obama will push for &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; legislation.  Just refrain from throwing objects at your television, and call your representatives again, again, and again.</p>
<p>Oh yes, the Wall Street Journal had an editorial today whining about how &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; legislation had not yet been introduced by the Obama administration.  They also purported a bogus study about how such legalization would result in untold billions of dollars to the US economy.  Unfortunately, they categorized the billions as revenue rather than expenses.</p>
<p>In summary, the &#8220;establishment&#8221; is gearing up for another push for immigration legislation in 2009 as 2010 is a &#8220;blackout&#8221; year because of the congressional elections.  Also, the Democrats will probably lose seats in 2010 so 2009 will have to be the year.  The plan will be to push the legislation through very quickly before an effective opposition can be mounted.  The enemy is currently probing our defenses and testing the waters.  This is evident by articles like these and statements from pressure groups and public officials.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;establishment&#8221; knows if this immigration legislation passes it will effectively end conservatism in the United States.  This is because European-Americans, the only significant proponents of conservatism and nationalism, will be overwhelmed by others who present no opposition to the globalist agenda that has been planned for a long time.</p>

		<p>I think most of the immigrants of the past, who the Statue of Liberty rose her torch to welcome, were people who wanted to find a new home, and adapt to a new way of life, and actually amke a positive contribution to their new homeland.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s immigrants seem to be mostly people from the Third World who have no wish to adapt, and who actually destroy, rather than build to make America stronger. They weaken America, I believe, like pathogenic viruses attacking a (once) healthy body!</p>

		<p>The ideas expressed above are typical of universal human rights globalists.  They do not recognize borders, US sovereignty, or differences in culture, language, and especially laws.  The only interest is &#8216;for&rsquo; their particular interests without regard to others or the costs.  I believe those who hold such thoughts are not responsible people. It is usually a non taxpayer without real Amercian heritage.  These people worship poverty and believe everyone else needs to give up what they have so everyone can live with same deficiency. Sob stories do not change the financial constraints. Amercians should not have to give up their nation or their laws, language and culture to please arrogant ignorant migrants who are disrespectful thieves.  They need to learn English first, obey the law and pay their way like everyone else.   V</p>

		<p>This article makes me shake with anger. It is clear to me that this man has NO loyalty to his own country, and given his way, he would have open borders and allow us to be flooded by a bunch of mexicans to feed and water. If he feels so sorry for them, then by all means move to mexico and help them in THEIR OWN COUNTRY. How DARE he try to pawn them off on the majority of American&rsquo;s who don&rsquo;t WANT THEM HERE! What does he think will happen when WE run out of natural resourses? I guess he doesn&rsquo;t care as long as we take care of them now, we can all starve together later. What an IDIOT!</p>

		<p>Why are they so desperate to change a law that is unenforced and normally ignored, even by the Federal authorities paid to enforce it? If we are no longer a nation of laws, then will they not ignore the new law just as surely as they ignore the current law? </p>
<p>What is at stake here is not the impact of unwelcome and uninvited guests from other countries. What is at stake here is the Republic of laws, itself. If we as a nation can allow ANY law to go unenforced or ignored, then what possible reason can we offer for enforcing ANY of the remaining laws. It is only the law that protects our rights as citizens and ensures the domestic tranquility, we all crave.</p>
<p>Take away the law and only tyranny remains. This is the real threat of illegal aliens not being correctly deported.</p>

		<p>The left is so blind to itself that it cannot understand that a nationalized healthcare system would soon bankrupt the nation (worse than it is) if it allows this sort of &#8220;immigration reform.&#8221;  No nation can hope to hold itself together financially and provide benefits, including healthcare, to the entire world.  The help that can be affored ought to be done only to best stabalize poor nations so that they can provide such things for their own populations rather than continually barge into other more wealthy nations.</p>

		<p>This is the most profoundly ignorant piece of drivel that I have ever read. Given this moron&rsquo;s logic, we should simply let all of the third world in. Then, when we become third world, what has been gained? Leftist logic always leads to bringing institutions and people down, never up. </p>

		<p>It is not a &#8220;natural migration.&#8221;  It is a mass invasion feted by the white (or white-ish) Mexican elite, especially those surrounding its conservative political parties.  This is why I wanted Luis Obrador to win in 2006, because the Mexican left isn&rsquo;t for this mass movement, they want Mexicans in Mexico to help topple the white power elite.  </p>

<p>Very true.  I think many Americans are unaware of a major trait of Hispanic Mestizos that differentiates them from Whites:  They are an emotional people.  They speak and write in emotional terms.  They are ruled and propelled by emotion, passion and pride.  Logical, less emotional Whites have a &#8220;communications gap&#8221; when we try to reason with them, just as we do with emotional, angry Blacks.</p>

		<p>The author makes a good point.  It&rsquo;s only natural and fair for poor, starving people to relocate to greener pastures.  We should have freighters going back and forth to Africa non-stop.  Ordinary Americans should have spare rooms empty and beds made in anticipation of the newly arrived American citizens.  Let&rsquo;s not hesitate.  The sooner we get those Africans repatrioted, the sooner they can begin contributing to our economy and security.</p>
