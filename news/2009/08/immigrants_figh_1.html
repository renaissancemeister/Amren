<h1>Immigrants Fight to Bring Adult Children to US</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Taxin, Google News, August 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Evelyn Santos began her quest for a green card nearly two decades ago, hoping someday she and her family could leave the Philippines and start a better life in the United States.</p>
<p>The opportunity came in 2007, but with a painful caveat: Her two elder sons were now too old to qualify as dependents, so they would have to stay behind.</p>
<p>The mother moved to Northern California with her husband and two younger children, and filed a new round of paperwork hoping to get at least one of her older sons into the country without another decade of waiting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration attorneys say thousands of immigrants are stuck in a similar situation. In countries such as the Philippines, Mexico and China, relatives of U.S. citizens and residents sometimes wait a decade or two for a family-sponsored green card because of country-based immigration quotas.</p>
<p>Santos is one of several immigrants across the country suing the federal government to try to get their adult children into the country without another lengthy wait.</p>
<p>Under U.S. immigration law, children 21 and older cannot immigrate under their parents&rsquo; applications for green cards.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Robert Reeves, an immigration attorney who filed a nationwide class-action lawsuit in federal court in Santa Ana, said he believes 20,000 immigrants living in the United States face similar problems bringing their children here.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government contends that Congress passed the law to help current U.S. citizens and residents reunite with their families, not to help future immigrants bring their families here.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs argue that the law reads more broadly than that, and should include adult children whose parents had differing forms of sponsorship, including that by siblings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigrant advocates say the government should not require families to wait so long to immigrate together, claiming it discourages legal immigration. Nor should aspiring immigrants be forced to choose between their children and reuniting with their siblings and parents in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The dilemma has prompted many immigrant parents to urge their adult children to remain single while the lawsuits are pending or until they get green cards. That&rsquo;s because permanent residents cannot apply for their married children to get green cards and must wait to become U.S. citizens to be able to do so.</p>

		<p>Massive immigration, whether it&rsquo;s illegal, legal or both is going to end this nation as a first world nation. It is already at deaths door. Where are the &#8220;new industries&#8221;, that will raise us out of the ashes? Where is the boundless optimism and creativity, that overtook the nation like a force of nature in the nineteen sixties? There are posters here who rightly condemn the baby boomer generation and their parents for the present state of our country.</p>
<p>In defense of the boomers, I can only say that they made an enormous impact on this nation. They accomplished a lot beginning with the sixties, and lasting up to the close of the twentieth century. They impacted and invented all kinds of  things like space techonology, the creation of personal computers, the internet and even many social issues as simple as insisting on wheelchair ramps and access for the disabled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,the more irresponsible among the boomers, along with their ultra liberal parents, went too far with certain other social issues and what they did has created a mess that might just mean the end of this nation, as a first world nation. No, I don&rsquo;t believe like some people do that it simple has to do with importing the third world. It goes far beyond that. For example, it is one thing to import millions of third world residents who have a hard time assimilating and quite another thing to empower them to stay as seperate as possible and to even protest the new nation they have entered. This was criminal, and continues to be criminal today.</p>

		<p>BOBBY: The people who made this country great in the 50s and 60s were NOT boomers.  They were born in the teens through mid thirties.  Neither set of boomers (the hippies born from 46 to 54) or the second wave (my group born 55 to 63) contributed much to the advancement of the US.  The early boomers were dirty hippies who did drugs, protested and were generally disgusting.  They didn&rsquo;t have children and are represented by Bill and Hill.  Cheslea exists just to further her father&rsquo;s political ambitions (and to make the marriage look real).  A bunch of low lifes I do not care to be lumped in with.</p>

		<p>It starts with fighting for the right to bring their grown up kids over to the USA. Once they&rsquo;ve won this fight, the focus will shift to the rights of these grown up kids to bring their own families with them.</p>
<p>All immigration should be cancelled.</p>

		<p>#2 Istvan  &mdash;   Hungarian isn&rsquo;t it? Just curious,guessing names is a hobby of mine. I have to disagree with you on the boomers being characterized as &#8220;hippies&#8221;. The truth is very few were. In fact, very few people in the U.S. including the boomers, were, proportionatly speaking, either war protesters or hippies. The whole hippie movement was mainly a thing that some young people played at for a while  &mdash;  and not many at that. They quickly moved into the regular business of making a living or going to college, or joining or getting drafted into the military. Most of the boomers grew up, as I did, in conservative families. Another misperception, is how many people protested the Vietman War. Again, compared to the population at the time,not many people did. The number could conservativly be put at about six hundred thousand. Shoot, many of the illegal alien Gran Marches, a few years ago, had more protestors than that.</p>
