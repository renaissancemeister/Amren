			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Washington Examiner, Aug. 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>My July 22 article, entitled &#8220;Virginia newspaper refuses to print race of wanted suspect,&#8221; commented on the absurdity of a report on the Loudoun Times-Mirror website which listed the height, weight, and clothing of a robbery suspect, but failed to mention the suspect&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The piece (&#8220;Four men robbed in Sugarland Run&#8221;) appeared in the Times-Mirror on July 20 was actually changed several days later, when the race of the suspect was listed.</p>
<p>Not only was the race of the black suspect in this robbery retroactively inserted into the article, but the race of a Hispanic suspect in another crime had also been listed. This was a tremendous change in the policy of the Times-Mirror, as explained to me by a staffer with the paper.</p>
<p>Both before and after I wrote my article criticizing the policy of deleting the race of wanted suspects, I made several attempts to contact the paper&rsquo;s editor Paul Smith. He has refused to reply to both my emails as well as my phone calls.</p>
<p>However, the following response was left in the comments section under my article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Loudoun Time-Mirror says:</p>
<p>This is the Loudoun Times-Mirror responding.</p>
<p>First, it is not our policy to omit all mention of race. That was a misunderstanding. We follow AP style: Race is not to be used as the sole identifier of a person, but when it serves a useful purpose as part of a broader description of a person, it is to be included. The online version of this particular story has been updated, and it appeared correctly in print. </p>
<p>Secondly, your report contains inaccuracies. For example, our reporter gave you her name. Also, you never identified your affiliation or stated your purpose in the call. Disclosing your identity and purpose before conducting an interview is a basic tenet of good journalism.</p>
<p>We regret the misunderstanding on our race policy, and we welcome all comments and questions, as well as criticism.&#8221;</p>
<p>(snip}</p>
<p>Despite the statement, the reporter to whom I spoke told me emphatically that it had become the policy of the Loudoun Time-Mirror, to always omit any mention of race in every story, even when describing an at-large suspect.</p>
<p>Her exact words to me were: &#8220;all mention of race must be taken out of every story.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I left out of my article was the frustration she said she felt with this policy and her desire to list the race of every wanted suspect. When I told her that I would try again to speak with her editor about the policy, she laughed and said &#8220;Oh yeah, good luck with that!&#8221;</p>
<p>I will leave it up to you, the reader, to decide if the omission of the suspect&rsquo;s race was simply a &#8220;misunderstanding,&#8221; or the now, former policy of the paper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Had Mr. Smith acted as any good editor would have and responded honestly to my brief and polite questions, I would not have had to dig up the truth from one of his reporters, nor would I have even written the article.</p>
<p>Smith is no doubt angry because he was called-out for a ridiculous, politically-correct policy that put the good people (of all races) of Loudoun County at risk, by refusing to list the race when describing wanted suspects. He can remain anonymous on my website, and he can go on ducking my questions, he can even continue lecturing me on the basic tenets of &#8220;good journalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>I will however, continue to tell the truth and remember that one of those &#8220;basic tenets&#8221; is an obligation to protect the public. Unfortunately, many of those who still work in old media, seem to have forgotten that principle.<br>

		<p>Of COURSE it was official policy.  They only potential quibble I would have is that they might not leave race out of all stories, but only those stories where the suspects weren&rsquo;t white.  I remember the NBC affiliate where I used to live would never report the race of suspects, until one time they announced that a serial rapist was a white male.  They quickly said they did that because &#8220;this suspect was at large&#8221;.  But they were notorious for never doing that for at large black or Hispanic rapists, robbers, whatever.  Some other news stations and the newspaper did for at large suspects (though not for those arrested), but not them.</p>

		<p>In the first AR story about the LTM&rsquo;s policy, someone who claimed to be from the paper made a post here clairifying the paper&rsquo;s position.  Actually, I would credit AR far more than anyone for the LTM&rsquo;s change of heart.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about &#8220;news&#8221; reporting by Virginia newspapers. I do know, though, that local media - including &#8220;news&#8221; papers - routinely continue jeopardizing the safety of the public by omitting the race of violent criminals who are either caught, or who are on the loose. This ongoing practice is especially so when those criminals are &#8220;Blacks&#8221;.  It would not surprise me to learn  this is the prevailing practice throughout the nation, including by Virginia &#8220;news&#8221; papers.</p>

<i>&#8220;I made several attempts to contact the paper&rsquo;s editor Paul Smith. He has refused to reply to both my emails as well as my phone calls.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about a correspondence I had with editors of the Buffalo News concerning this issue.</p>
<p>While the Buffalo News says they have a policy where they don&rsquo;t identify race unless it&rsquo;s relevant to the crime (ie, a racially motivated &#8216;hate&rsquo; crime), one day they printed two dramatically different crime reports. In the first, blacks with automatic weapons were involved in a violent smash and grab. Although not identified as black by the Buffalo News, local news showed the surveillance video. In the second, a white teen robbed a connivance store but didn&rsquo;t display any weapon.</p>
<p>The editor and I wrote back and forth. He tried to convince me that there was no double standard and that the two reports were in line with their policy. The editor eventually stopped responding.</p>
<p>Last year, late spring or early winter, the Buffalo News reported that a black man was wanted in a series of sexual attacks. The Buffalo News didn&rsquo;t report the story until he had attacked seven women. Only then did the Buffalo News report the story which included photos of the suspect taken from closed circuit recordings.</p>
<p>The Buffalo News was so concerned about not wanting to identify a black man as a rapist that they let six other women be attacked when they could have identified him and give women the information they needed to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Women are literally being sacrificed for the sake of political correctness.<br>

<p>Why, pray tell, oh politically correct robot, why race cannot be used as a sole identifier?  I mean, if a black is running amuk killing white people, are people supposed to be on the lookout for all males of all races?  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a bit of help to the public you&rsquo;re supposed to keep informed, if the race is listed so as to reduce the number of people to watch out for? </p>

		<p>Another fact often omitted is the legal status of criminals.  For example, there will be a fatal drunk-driving accident, and someone with an Hispanic-sounding name will be charged.  Not once have I read that any of these drivers was an illegal alien; yet, we know that drunk-driving is disproportionate in certain groups of illegal aliens. </p>

		<p>People who read the Los Angeles Times over the years, started noticing a similar policy. It became so ridiculous as time went by, that because of this policy, and other politically correct inanities the Times constantly indulged in, they literally lost thousands of readers. The truth is, had the L.A. Times not carried certain store coupons, it would have sunk like a rock. What value would it have been for readers demanding accurate reporting?</p>

		<p><i>First, it is not our policy to omit all mention of race.</i></p>
<p><b>Don&rsquo;t make me laugh.</b>  In journalism school you are imbued with <b>hours</b> of white guilt and cultural sensitivity training.  You are <i>taught</i> that any story critical of another race or culture will be treated as racist and spiked, and that you, as a journalist, will be reprimanded regardless of the story&rsquo;s relevance to truth or reality. Who does this person think he&rsquo;s talking down to   &mdash;   a bunch of university-graduated boy scouts? </p>
<p>We know what your policy is, Loudoun Times-Mirror. </p>

		<p>It is not only the mention of an at-large criminal&rsquo;s race that they suppress, there is often an image available, either through a surveillance video, or police sketch, that would help women be on the lookout for the perpretator. This is itself criminal behavior.</p>

		<p>What kind of seared conscience would allow them to withhold key information on violent criminals still at large? Truly their political orthodoxy means more to them than the lives of their readers. That shows contempt, not sensitivity. There might be great explanatory power in a theory of the media as the White man&rsquo;s enemy.</p>

		<p>What`s the big deal? How many drive by shooters are not black or at least brown? How many rapists are not black or brown? How many 7-11s are not stuck up by black teenagers?<br>
     Putting down black male is a waste of ink. However if you replace rapist with pyramid schemer or crooked bond trader, a black man would be quite newsworthy.<br>

<p>True enough, Mr. Tiffany.  But in neither case (referring to the above) is the ethnicity of the culprit identified. In fact, you&rsquo;d be FAR more likely to see the ethnic identification of the 7-11 robber than of the crocked bond schemer. You will NEVER see the later!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed over and over again that news reports withhold the race of wanted violent criminals. It&rsquo;s routine. I&rsquo;ve encountered this practice even when the victims and other eyewitnesses have provided very detailed descriptions of the criminals. Estimates of height, weight, and age are permissible. Mentions of clothing colors and styles are common. The getaway car might be described by make, model, color, and condition. But race? Nope! </p>
<p>Political correctness is a societal cancer. </p>

		<p>Kudos to Mr. Gibson for taking this paper to task for its omission of race in crime reporting.</p>
<p>Having said that, I have an idea that might actually FORCE the papers to state the race of a perp, even if indirectly. Here are two examples:</p>
<p>Mary Public is attacked and raped by a Bantu. She is interrogated like so: &#8220;Ms. Public, can you give us a description of your attacker&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a big man, and he looked like Al Roker. Just like Al Roker, but he was bald like Charles Barkley&#8221;.</p>
<p>John Citizen is mugged by three Hispanics. He tells the police, the muggers looked like George Lopez, Antonio Banderas and Edward James Olmos.</p>
<p>In this way, the paper would be forced to acknowledge the race of the perps because the readers would then know the perp was Bantu in the first example; and Hispanic in the second.</p>
<p>Female minority perps are even easier to describe. If they are Bantu, then the police should be told the perp looked like Queen Latifah or Oprah Winfrey. If the female perp is Hispanic, then a comparison with Jennifer Lopez will suffice.</p>
<p>See? Anyone else here at Amren have a suggestion? </p>

<p>Yes; indeed it would be newsworthy. A crime of instant gratification and satisfaction is easy to comprehend, while a crime requiring planning, forethought and intelligence (however misguided and inappropriate) requires a different level of functioning.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are quite correct in your delineation of what constitutes &#8220;newsworthy&#8221;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a thought.   But I wonder of the papers might be afraid that they could be sued by those celebs for using their names in an unsavory light, comparing them to criminals.  I think the papers would be very leery of it.</p>

		<p>Why not take it a step further and instead of just omitting race from stories, omit gender, height and weight? All of these things can also be considered discriminatory.</p>

		<p>Something like this happened recently here in Toronto. An elderly White man was robbed and beaten to death by &#8220;four large dark-haired women&#8221;. This was the actual description used by the media. In fact three of the &#8220;dark-haired women&#8221; were black and I believe the fourth was another ethnic too.</p>
