<h1>Obama: We Must Fix Education in Black Communities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cynthia Gordy, Essence, August 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} In a recent conversation with reporters, Obama easily cited education as the most important issue for the black community.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we close the achievement gap, then a big chunk of economic inequality in this society is diminished,&#8221; Obama told a small group of journalists from black media outlets, including ESSENCE.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, how do we do that? Better teachers, greater accountability, and more resources combined with more reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a recent study from the National Center for Education Statistics, African-American students continue to score significantly lower in reading and math than their white counterparts.</p>
<p>Although the gap narrowed slightly between 1992 and 2007  &mdash;  about 7 points on a 500-point scale  &mdash;  the disparity remains wide, with black students still scoring about 28 points behind whites. Consequently, black children also have a far higher high school dropout rate and a lower rate of college enrollment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the early education front, the Recovery Act secured $4 billion for programs like Head Start and Early Head Start, which provide education and parent involvement services to low-income families, for infants and children up to age 5. The 2010 federal budget has also called for a significant increase in these programs.</p>
<p>With regard to the K-12 part of the pipeline, the Obama administration is using money given to states from the Recovery Act as a proverbial carrot to drive education reform in the country&rsquo;s worst performing schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The president has also called for federal budget funds for charter schools, where he sees thriving education innovations taking place, and for proven programs focusing on dropout prevention and college enrollment.</p>
<p>Another Obama proposal is Promise Neighborhoods, which would make grants available to low-income communities to start comprehensive education and parenting programs similar to New York&rsquo;s successful Harlem Children&rsquo;s Zone program.</p>
<p>On higher education, the president is working with Congress to increase funding for the Pell grant, which is targeted to low-income students. &#8220;It&rsquo;s an incredibly important tool, and we&rsquo;ve seen it underfunded and not rising with inflation,&#8221; said Higginbottom.</p>
<p>The Recovery Act also included a $2,500 annual tax credit, which working families can use toward college tuition and which covers the full cost of tuition at most two-year community colleges. {snip}</p>

		<p>like putting money in a bottomless pit and hoping to fill it up. wishful thinking with reality being the opposite. it would make more sense to fund the ACHIEVERS in society with better schools, books and teachers and let the underachievers pull themselves up. the reason for the difference is obvious to most but it is not PC to say so. Some new teachers think they can make a difference because black kids are just misunderstood but educable soon realize why they are at the bottom of the achievement scale. Lets face it&hellip;the next lower class of achievers to black kids are those with very low IQ&rsquo;s.  </p>

		<p>Shaker Hts, Ohio has had some success with getting blacks to pass the State of Ohio tests, but they teach to the test. I don&rsquo;t think the blacks are actually closing the gap with whites, but through rote memory and drilling more blacks are passing the state tests.</p>

		<p>How much more money needs to be thrown at Black schools before people finally get it. No amount of money is going to raise IQs above where they are now. Blacks scream and yell that their schools are underfunded and substandard but kids can learn no matter what environment they are in. If you look at financial school records you will see that the inner city schools are far and away more heavily funded than suburban or rural schools. If blacks were to get a hold of their kids, demand that they do their school work, take away the hip hop cds and generally look after their kids. Black adults are hardly any more mature than the kids, spending money on bling rather than saving for the future. </p>

<p>If everyone had the same genes, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any achievement gap.</p>
<p>BTW, the money thing hasn&rsquo;t worked. Here in Buffalo, after years of bitching about the suburbs spending more money on education, Buffalo city schools spend more money per student. I believe black failure rates have risen to 54-56%.</p>

<p>NOPE, wrong, won&rsquo;t work.  Until black mothers want their children to learn, until black sperm donors become real fathers, black kids will NEVER reach their potential, whatever that may be.  Blame the teachers, the unions, the books or the buildings but never, EVER, blame the real cause of the problem.</p>
<p>A society that can not speak honestly about a problem will never solve that problem.  That is why the USSR collapsed - no one could speak the truth out of fear.  When the truth finally leaked out it was too late.  That is where PC is leading us.</p>

		<p>You know sometimes, if you live long enough, you begin to see the same things as an adult as you saw as a child. In that frame,  the state of Black education reminds me of The Fall of Saigon 1975.<br>
When NVA spearheads were twenty miles from the Presidential Palace, there was an emergency meeting of the U.S. Congress. They began to debate the use of  B-52 &#8220;airstrikes&#8221; to restore the situation. And one ederly woman statesman, her first name was Millicent, addressed the politicians. &#8220;We have sent a half a million troops, 10 trillion dollars, battleship after battleship and now we think that just another  dozen airplanes sent out at dawn  can somehow fix what 15 years and all the blood and treasure of the United States could not?!?&#8221; Sounding more and more like the situation here&hellip;</p>

		<p>If the president really would like to improve the condition of black education he should focus on reversing the cultural trait of anti-intellectualism and complete disdain for any form of progress. Throwing money at a problem instead of treating the cause (victimization ideology, anti-intelectualism, and disdain for progress) will only end with us at square one.</p>

		<p>When I started school in the 1930&rsquo;s, I already knew my colors, my alphabet, and how to count numbers. My parents taught me. The black kids in my school also knew these things because their parents taught them. God help me if I ever got into trouble in school.  What happened in the intervening years to change that? Answer that question and you&rsquo;ll know why the children of today don&rsquo;t quite measure up to standards.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not too far from the onset of my eighth decade and I&rsquo;ve been hearing this same tireless mantra since the late Fifties, to wit, all we have to do to elevate black scholastic achievement levels is pour more money into their schools.</p>
<p>Despite almost incalculable sums poured into improving inner city schools, blacks, if anything, are more ignorant today than they were a half-century ago.  To be fair about it, so are white kids, but the racial disparity remains about the same.  Could it be that (Gasp!) blacks are, on average, markedly less intelligent than whites, Asians, and even Amer-Indians?  Well, that&rsquo;s certainly what IQ testing indicates.  But, of course, we all know that the tests are &#8220;culturally biased,&#8221; though it remains a mystery how Asians and others coming from societies and cultures far different from the Euro-American culture seem to shrug off these ostensible cultural disadvantages.</p>
<p>Not only are the tests biased, but the whole culture is biased!<br>
But only against blacks.  All other racial groups seem to navigate quite successfully through our culture.</p>
<p>Just how long can this incredibly convoluted lunacy continue? Acknowledging the nature of a problem is utterly essential to finding the optimum solution to it. </p>

<p>Which &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; is he talking about?  The one between blacks and Asians, or the one between blacks and Indians, or the one between blacks and Hispanics, or blacks and Arabs, or blacks and southeastern Asians, or the one between blacks and whites?</p>
<p>What good will it do to fudge test scores and award unearned AA grades to blacks?   They still won&rsquo;t be able to adequately perform just because they have a worthless piece of paper in their hands.</p>
<p>If anyone should know the intelligence gap between blacks and ALL the other races cannot be closed, it is Obama being involved with the black community for 25 years as a community organizer.</p>
<p>His intention, of course, is to force blacks into mainstream professions any way he can, as in the healthcare bill that forces med schools to favor blacks over whites.</p>
<p>Any white who supports this man is an absolute idiot.</p>

		<p>In a normal society, leaders would be required to PROVE that low black I.Q.&rsquo;s are NOT due to genetics.  Only then would they be allowed to throw billions of dollars at the issue.  But not in America.  In America, we ASSUME that average I.Q. is somehow miraculously equal across the globe and then, based on that assumption, we throw billions of dollars at the &#8220;problem&#8221;, accuse whites of systematic racism, institute pervasive discrimination and bring death and chaos.  Heaven forbid there should actually be any serious studies on racial differences by the government.</p>

		<p>No new educational nostrum will solve the problems of biology. No innovative method of teaching, or placement of classrooms, or shifting around of students and teachers will make much difference. </p>
<p>I only wish I am wrong. I only want the best for blacks and other so called minorities. The problem is, as we see endlessly discussed here on Amren, but we never never see in the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; of media, and even so called conservative media, that the Bell Curve is part of a dismal truth: there is at least one or more standard deviations in intelligence between the average black and the average white. Even such intellectuals as, say Bill Bennett, former Education Czar, and a pretty serious fellow, would never allow themselves to be in the same Zip Code as Jared Taylor. And yet, in a debate, Taylor, who has science (and no ill-will that I can see) on his side, would be hooted down as a racist charlatan. </p>

		<p>Head Start has been an epic failure ever since it&rsquo;s start. That just goes to show you that these people truly live in another world: Throw more money at already failing programs. </p>
<p>Since blacks are obviously so unhappy with &#8220;whitey&rsquo;s&#8221; school systems, just bring back segregated schooling. Black teachers, black administrators, black students, black staff, funded by the black community and black taxpayers. Of course, most blacks are aware of black ineptitude and would never fall for such a fair solution. </p>
<p>Besides all that, can anyone give empirical evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that pushing more money into the situation improves it any? Since when did a good education (non-University) require so much money? Did your parents and grandparents need tons of &#8220;state-of-the-art&#8221; teaching equipment, laptops, and all sorts of other non-necessities? Did they need expensive buildings full of expensive, modern amenities? </p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t. A good education requires great teachers, a great principal, great parents that are willing to oversee their child&rsquo;s education and help out when need be, good textbooks, good study habits, a supportive local community, a good pencil and some paper. Sure, some kids need a little extra help, that&rsquo;s what teachers, parents, afterschool tutoring and mentors are for. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the slightly more insightful black pillars know this and know the only solution is to beg (or force) for whitey&rsquo;s support. Organization, planning ahead, parenting and education are simply not a common product of their genome. </p>
<p>The world needs ditchdiggers, too. You can&rsquo;t turn a mentally incapable into Einstein; one&rsquo;s DNA and personal fortitude determines that. </p>
<p>Segregation is the answer. </p>

		<p>What I was trying to say was that if Black parents got after their kids, expected them to do well in school and actually followed up with it then Black acheivement would go up considerably. Based on statistics, Black test scores and acheivement was higher under segregation, plus community pride was higher. When all of the social experimentation started in the 1960&rsquo;s community pride took a plunge, even in White neighborhoods since their kids often were bussed across town for school. </p>

		<p>The issue of being well &#8220;educated&#8221; is strictly IQ related.  It has nothing to do with the amount of money spent, being &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221; or having &#8220;educational opportunity&#8221;.  </p>
<p>High IQ&rsquo;s will generate high wealth.  But wealth will not generate a high IQ.  IQ is hereditary and race related.  The only way to change the &#8220;inequality&#8221; is to discriminate against the high IQ.  </p>
<p>Racist tactics to achieve this &#8220;goal&#8221; are known as: <br>
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, CIVIL RIGHTS, DIFFERENTIAL VALIDATION, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, HUMAN RIGHTS, PARITY and PROTECTED CLASSES.  </p>

<p>I agree with you 100% on Booker T. Washington. I believe he was the best black man ever produced by this nation. Sadly though, his day is past. The blacks today wouldn&rsquo;t/couldn&rsquo;t listen to his message.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone is aware of it, but Booker . Washington gave the greatest civil rights speech (&#8220;The American Standard&#8221;)ever in 1896 in front of the Harvard alumni association. Anyone who ever read that speech would know that he was a special man. </p>

		<p>What needs to be fixed is the attitude of parents toward their children. They have to stop abusing their kids emotionally and physically. They have to encourage their kids to study and learn. They have to stop creating angry little monsters who hate themselves and everything White, and blame all their problems on anything White. They have to stop them from committing crime, stop them from hating authority, law, right and themselves. <br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;If we close the achievement gap, then a big chunk of economic inequality in this society is diminished..&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, the start of yet another school year.  This will be my 27th.  Next week are the mandated meetings I am forced to sit through twice a year.  Topic? &#8221; How to Close the Achievement Gap&#8221;  and &#8220;How to Eradicate Inequalities in Education.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this age of PC terrorism, what other topic could there possibly be to talk about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there will be at least one AA-promoted black (or more recently hispanic) guest speaker from a local university that will blather on about the latest research proving that the racial achievement gap is not caused by differences in intelligence because there are none, but rather by systematic White Oppression of Communities of Color, Inequity in Educational Funding, White Methods of Teaching, White Dominance of the Teaching Profession, Textbooks that Demean People of Color (when the exact opposite is true), and Inherent White Racism toward Communities of Color.</p>
<p>The solutions are always the same:  More funding needed to &#8216;equalize educational opportunities&rsquo;, more &#8216;outreach to communities of color&rsquo;, more scholarships for non-Whites, more hiring of low IQd NAM teachers (oops! That one could get me fired), and so on.</p>
<p>You can bet that your high IQd White or Asians child will not be on the agenda  &mdash;  in fact in 30 years (including ed school) I have never attended or even seen offered professional development addressing the needs of high IQd White or Asian children (although with Asians this is changing as the Asian population increases and they  fund their own advocates to promote their people AND they are impervious to screams of racism hurled at them, unlike Whites).</p>
<p>In fact, the latest educational trends have been away from honors and AP classes as  colleges and universities, under tremendous pressure, are beginning not use AP scores for admission purposes or to count as college credits.  This is because NAMs (non-Asian minorities), due to inherent low group IQs cannot handle the AP curricula, let alone the AP tests.</p>
<p>According to Steve Sailer&rsquo;s excellent article on AP exams (remember, a passing score is 3):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Excluding [the Spanish AP exam], Latinos in 2008 averaged a 2.17 score with a 35 percent passing rate. <br>
Black scores fell a comparable amount over the last decade, from a mean of 2.21 to 1.91&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sigh.  I could repeat these meetings, lectures and discussions from rote memory I&rsquo;ve hear them so often.  Good thing I&rsquo;ve saved up a couple of Sunday NY Times Cross Word Puzzles.  I just have to make sure I&rsquo;m early enough to grab one of the seats in the back of the room  &mdash;  those go first.</p>

		<p>Spending Billions and Billions of Dollars on trying to improve the academic performance of low-IQ students is bad enough.  But the real crime is that meanwhile, our best and brightest are ignored. Imagine if 1/4 of the money spent on Head-Start, Ebonics, Afro-centric teaching, Black-History Month, midnight basketball, and other &#8220;enrichment&#8221; programs for low-IQ students were spent on &#8220;gifted&#8221; students.  As I&rsquo;ve said before at this site: Spend a Trillion Dollars on African Americans and we can improve their average reading levels from an 8th grade level to a 10th grade level.  Spend one-tenth of that amount on gifted students of all races, and we will cure cancer, solve the energy crises, establish colonies on Mars.  Our civilization depends not on the ability of janitors to read, but on the scientific breakthroughs that will be made by the smartest among us.  We need to focus on these students   &mdash;   the cognitive elite.<br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an Amren Classic Article here that covers Kansas City and the billions of dollars spent on the schools there making them the best money could buy, almost breaking the state. Within a few years they were trashed and the kids were no different. You can&rsquo;t fix stupid.</p>

		<p><i>Although the gap narrowed slightly between 1992 and 2007 &mdash; about 7 points on a 500-point scale &mdash; the disparity remains wide</i></p>
<p>It appears that these statistics reflect scores of public school students only.  I have to wonder if between 1992 and 2007 many more of the smartest white students either departed for private schools or were homeschooled instead.  When combined with a general lowering of academic standards during that time, this may account for the modest narrowing observed.</p>

<p>If you were not worried about losing your job you could almost put together a montage of textbook entries that refute the claim that textbooks denegrate minorities, show financial records where minority schools recieve far more money than majority white schools and that affirmative action programs to help failing students who are minorities are more common than those that will also accept white students. </p>

		<p>The exact opposite of what is claimed is actually true.  &#8220;Blacks&#8221; have infected and ruined almost all American public schools for several generations now, since my school time in the late 60&rsquo;s-early 70&rsquo;s, ground zero  &mdash;  forced busing.  As every reader here knows, &#8220;bias&#8221;, &#8220;racism&#8221;, etc., are buzzwords for the PC liberals only.  Now ALL children can and apparently will be dumb ghetto types, regardless of melanin.</p>

		<p>They wanted school integration and now we have had it for decades&hellip;..students of all races in the same classrooms and the same schools. Obviously, there are no black communities anymore in terms of education because there are no black schools&hellip;except for the private schools.</p>
<p>I am still waiting for the next silly egalitarian goal to be embraced:  to correct the imbalance on the playing field, as well as in the classroom. Just as whites cannot be allowed to outperform blacks in the classroom, the same thinking would not allow blacks to outperform whites on the athletic fields in football, basketball, baseball and track.</p>

		<p>The handful of blacks in the congress got there because they live in districts that are 90% plus black.  Not one black made it to the congress from a district with a white majority.  This proves that Obama wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;elected&#8221; due to a majority of votes from the white majority&hellip; </p>

		<p>You can throw all the money you want into education and it will never do any good as long as the students and their parents refuse to be actively engaged and continue to view school as a warehouse until it&rsquo;s their turn for the dole. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for her to have a baby, get her own government check and move out&hellip;&rdquo; is a direct quote from a Granny at an adult daycare facility about her 16 year old grand daughter. I worked there while I put myself through college after returning from the Gulf, it was an eye opener and began to knock the liberal cobwebs from my mind and rosy tint off my glasses. </p>
<p>The ostensible reason for our educational system is to educate children so that they can become productive members of society. In actuality, the system merely transfers wealth from those that produce to an entire class of &ldquo;Educators&rdquo; and other bureaucrats who perpetuate &ldquo;make work&rdquo; programs for the dull and listless while they continually seek more funds from the public coffers to pad their already cushy fiefdoms. </p>
<p>Everyone gets relatively the same tools. Take them, run like heck and strive to be the best – if you fall short while aiming high you&rsquo;ll sill wind up better off. Thoughts like that seem lost on several generations of Blacks bred since Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s tragically misnamed &ldquo;Great Society&rdquo; and &ldquo;War On Poverty&rdquo;.<br>
