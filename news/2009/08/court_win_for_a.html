	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The decision by Judge Sam Sparks strongly upheld the admissions policies at the University of Texas at Austin as consistent with the Supreme Court ruling  &mdash;  and rejected the argument that Texas had failed to meet the tests set out by the Supreme Court. In so doing, Judge Sparks shut down (for now) one strategy of those who oppose affirmative action  &mdash;  namely trying to say that colleges&rsquo; policies go beyond what the Supreme Court permitted. But the legal group that brought the case vowed Monday night to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and, if necessary, to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The arguments in the suit against Texas generally attempted to use the Grutter v. Bolllinger decision, which upheld the use of race at the University of Michigan law school, to limit affirmative action. The Texas lawsuit, filed on behalf of a white high school senior who was rejected by UT Austin, noted that Grutter was premised on a link between diversity goals and educational goals, and that the decision did not envision the consideration of race as open-ended. The suit argued that because Texas didn&rsquo;t define a specific percentage goal and continued to use affirmative action after having success at attracting many minority students, the university was going too far.</p>
<p>But Judge Sparks disagreed. &#8220;The court finds both the plaintiffs&rsquo; arguments unpersuasive and finds UT has a compelling interest in student body diversity as articulated in Grutter. First and foremost, nothing in Grutter suggests a university must establish a specific percentage, or range of percentages, the achievement of which would satisfy critical mass,&#8221; Sparks wrote. He goes on to say that if UT did establish a specific percentage, it might be creating a quota of the sort barred by Grutter.</p>
<p>Another argument by the plaintiffs was that the university&rsquo;s use of affirmative action was illegal because it primarily benefits black and Latino applicants, and not other minority groups. Again, Judge Sparks rejected the argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plaintiffs cite no evidence to show racial groups other than African-Americans and Hispanics are excluded from benefiting from UT&rsquo;s consideration of race in admissions,&#8221; he wrote. {snip}</p>
<p>A novel argument made in the suit was that the use of the &#8220;10 percent&#8221; plan in Texas  &mdash;  recently modified, but under which those in the top 10 percent of their high school classes were assured admission  &mdash;  meant that the university couldn&rsquo;t also consider race in admissions. Texas adopted the 10 percent system after a federal appeals court barred the use of race in admissions. But when the Michigan decision came down, it overturned that decision, and UT Austin  &mdash;  while still covered by 10 percent  &mdash;  resumed consideration of race and ethnicity in admissions. The plaintiffs argued in the case that since 10 percent helped promote diversity without considering race, there was no justification for considering race.</p>
<p>Of this argument, the judge said the following: &#8220;The undisputed evidence establishes that UT has done more than merely consider race-neutral alternatives. The vast majority of UT students are admitted under the Top Ten Percent law, which plaintiffs agree is a race-neutral policy, and the undisputed evidence establishes UT has instituted several scholarship programs intended to increase the diversity yield from acceptance to enrollment, expanded the quality and quantity of its outreach efforts to high schools in underrepresented areas of the state, and focused additional attention and resources on recruitment in low-performing schools.</p>
<p>Despite these race-neutral efforts to expand diversity at UT, in 2004 the university determined it still lacked a diverse student body, as evidenced by the absence of African-American and Hispanic students in thousands of its classes. To argue UT has failed to give serious, good faith consideration to race-neutral alternatives is to ignore the facts of this case  &mdash;  namely, that UT has used and continues to use race-neutral alternatives in addition to its limited consideration of race as part of its admissions process.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A statement from the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which opposed the suit, said that the ruling was important in upholding the right of universities like Texas to use a mix of race-neutral and race-conscious ways to build a diverse class of students. &#8220;The court&rsquo;s ruling sends a strong message to universities across the nation that race can still be a factor when considering applications for admissions,&#8221; said Nina Perales, MALDEF&rsquo;s Southwest regional counsel.</p>

		<p>Bottom line: blacks and latinos don&rsquo;t get into the elite UT Austin campus anywhere near their numerical representation of High School Seniors. Tough luck. Also, the judge said: &#8220;Plaintiffs cite no evidence to show racial groups other than African-Americans and Hispanics are excluded from benefiting from UT&rsquo;s consideration of race in admissions,&rdquo; he wrote. {snip}</p>
<p><br>
This is true. So while the words of the decision pay tribute to the unconstitutional concept of Affirmative Action, the fact is that the overwhelming majority of Latinos and blacks in Texas stay out of the top university, and frankly out of most of the state univerisities of quality. Yes there are local state colleges which are the equivalent of high school that are almost entirely black or Latino. Fine. Let them go there. They won&rsquo;t get a single professional job of influence assuming they graduate these trade schools, which they won&rsquo;t to a large extent. Segregation is alive and well. What a hoot. Those of you who drink, please lift a toast to the late great George Wallace. Governor, you won.</p>

		<p>One wonders how much longer this insanity can go on.  In the meantime, we must make sure to avoid black/Hispanic doctors, attorneys, engineers etc. as much as possible.  By placing emphasis on race, those universities are ensuring that black and Hispanic &#8220;professionals&#8221; will be inferior, overall, to their white/Asian counterparts.  It&rsquo;s really not a difficult concept to comprehend.  As they lower the standards for those groups, it is inevitable that they will yield lower standards from among those groups.</p>
<p>As it becomes obvious, to the public, that black and Hispanic &#8220;professionals&#8221; are of lower quality - there will be less demand for their services.  This lower demand will, in turn, be interpreted as &#8220;racism&#8221; and as justification for yet MORE quota programs.  Eventually, diplomas from those institutions will be worth little more than the paper they&rsquo;re printed on and people will seek alternate forms of documentation.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal anyway?  It&rsquo;s just a few thousands white kids being screwed over for poor performing &#8220;minorities.&#8221;  Aren&rsquo;t whites now a minority in Texas?  If so, this should be noted.  Whites will continue to be discriminated against until there are no more whites, of this I&rsquo;m certain.   </p>

<p>The day is coming when one of the favored are going to be discriminated against just because they are not white, for real. Whether this will be enough to counter-act state and corporate sponsored, and race-conscious affirmative action is debateable, but I do believe that day is coming, and long overdue. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the &#8220;10 Percent&#8221; quota scheme was devised by then-Governor George Bush and the Texas Republicans. Curious George carried this same pro-affirmative action racism with him to the White House.</p>
<p>When was the last time you heard a GOP politician talking about ending affirmative action? They don&rsquo;t support us. Why should we support them?</p>

		<p>Since whites number under ten percent of the global population, they should behave like a prudent minority, and safeguard for themselves the scarce opportunities their ancestors created. Above all else, whites must recognize their minority status. </p>
<p>Calling Asians, Hispanics or blacks &#8216;minorities&rsquo; is to wear selective blinders.</p>

<p>I work with several affirmative action &#8220;engineers&#8221;. They are NOT qualified and the software they are involved with has to be re-designed and re-implemented.</p>
<p>Despite their obvious incompetency, my employer needs these tokens. As a result they have survived TWO layoffs in the last eight months that tossed many highly educated and qualified 25-35 year old WHITE male engineers onto the street. (none of the H1B East Indians got the axe either&hellip;.they like working in the USA for lower wages).</p>
<p>In other words, these parasites continue to prosper long after they received their first affirmative action handouts at a university. </p>
<p>All I can say is&hellip;the WHITE engineering anger is building.</p>

If this does make it to the Supreme Court, Justice Sotomayor is sure to re-write the Grutter v. Bolllinger decision.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ll get is both race as an admission factor AND quotas.</p>

		<p>Where is all this pressure on universities to admit unqualified minorities?  Administrators primarily try to improve their rank and no national ranking services includes racial diversity as a factor.  So why do they care about race?</p>

		<p>Interesting isn&rsquo;t it? Over an over again, Americans of European ancestry can see, openly, those who are working against them, to deny them. These elites aren&rsquo;t doing it secretly, but openly. All the more astounding that so many European Americans are oblivious to it all, or simply ignore the implications. As I&rsquo;ve stated before, WHEN WILL THE DAY ARRIVE, THAT THE BLESSED STATE OF EQUALITY FINALLY ARRIVES FOR &#8220;MINORITIES&#8221;. Well, here&rsquo;s one clue;,to paraphrase Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor, it might take another twenty five years, and even then it might not be enough time. WOW!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Affirmative Action&#8221; is one of the greatest evils of American society, for sure. Nonetheless, The way to fight it is NOT by litigation. This is tantamount to playing into the hands of the AA maniacs. The only way for whites to succeed is to grin, bear it, and continue to work hard and do their best, as they have done for millenia, and as Asians have done in this country for so long. (The latest AR tells us that even this is no longer the case for Asians, a very sad fact). Let &#8220;minorities&#8221; fight to the death in court and think that this is their way up. Whites and Asians should just focus on themselves and on their success and keep themselves out of this legal mess. I know this sounds too fortune cookie-like, but this is the only way to make it in this world. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often thought it odd that some conservatives will push for open borders (as long as the immigrants are not white) and still push for an end to affirmative action. </p>
<p>Given demographic and racial realities it is now almost impossible to end affirmative action as blacks and Hispanics can simply vote themselves preferences. Most whites do not like these quotas but there is probably no going back to a meritocracy.</p>

		<p>The 10% system is obviously NOT a race-neutral policy and I&rsquo;m sick of hearing that it is. The whole point of it was to get more blacks &amp; Latinos into UT adn other fine universities. This is done by effectively discriminating against academically better whites who happen to fall under the 10% level at their high quality majority white schools. But even this was not enough so under the black principle of give us an inch and will take thousands of miles from you suckers, they use Grutter (falsely) to discriminate even more against better white students.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all anti-white (& East Asian) discrimination by linguistic smoke &amp; mirrors.  Everybody knows this but some judges are all bleeding hearts for blacks who have never been known to sacrifice any of their own for other races or tribes. </p>
<p>Thank you </p>

<p>The was never a case for asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION. Native BornWhite American Workers shut asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION down completetly in the 18th century. Socialist and well known labor leader Samuel Gompers was an enthusiastic supporter of the Chinese Exclusion Act.</p>
<p>There are people who post here who could care less about the thousands of Native Born White American families who were sevrely harmed by LEGAL ASIAN immigants since the early 1970s-Native Born American Men such as my late father-an Irish Catholic,mechanical engineer,father of seven and vetran. My late father cursed asian LEGAL IMMIGRATON  two weeks before he died.</p>
<p>There was and there conitunues to be no justification for any asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION. Asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION was effectively shut down to 0 in the 18th century. And this was a wonderfull policy that protected the legitmate racial intertests of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>The is no economic,demographic,cultural and ecological reason to import LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians. Go to Brenda Walker&rsquo;s victims to get a small sampling of the harm LEGAL asian IMMIGRANTS inflict on Native Born White Americans. Some of you who post here are bona fide race traitors.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;top 10 percent&#8221; Bushism (California is going to adopt it, too, for the UC system) is also affirmative action.  You can have nothing more than a regular pulse and a fair attendance record and finish in the top 10 percent in many black and Hispanic high schools.  In some white schools, you&rsquo;ll have busted your tail to have finished at the 11th percentile.  </p>
