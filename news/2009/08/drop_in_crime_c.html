<h1><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/07/27/daily89.html">Drop in Crime Coincides With Exodus of Illegal Immigrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Sunnucks, Phoenix Business Journal, July 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Phoenix has seen a 25 percent decline in the number of crimes during the first five months of 2009 compared to the same time period in 2007 when the economy began to slow. Violent crime in Phoenix is down 12 percent, according crime statistics from the Phoenix Police Department.</p>
<p>The Mesa Police Department reports a 19 percent decrease in total crimes for the first half of 2009 versus the first half of 2007, including a 10 percent drop in violent crime. Tempe has seen a 25 percent total drop.</p>
<p>At the same time, the state&rsquo;s illegal immigrant population has decreased by as much as one-third thanks to the down U.S. economy, tougher enforcement polices by the federal government and Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, as well as the state&rsquo;s employer sanctions law which goes after businesses who hire undocumented workers, said Steven Camarota, director of the Center for Immigration Studies.</p>
<p>CIS estimates Arizona&rsquo;s illegal immigrant population has gone from 579,000 in 2007 to 388,000 this year  &mdash;  191,000-person drop.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CIS estimates the U.S. illegal immigrant population has dropped from 12.5 million in 2007 to 10.8 million now.</p>

		<p>Do we really need to be told that when the illegal population drops in cities in Arizona, the crime rate will also drop?  Poor Arizona, they don&rsquo;t have the high Black population statistics to pick up the slack.  Oh well.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve lived and worked in Calif., Colorado, Nevada, texas, and Arizona, all heavily populated mestizo states, and the thefts in those areas were almost always involving mestizos.  </p>
<p>Their murder rate was high also, and their gang activity was everywhere.</p>
<p>But, as bad as they behave, they&rsquo;re nowhere near as bad as blacks.</p>

		<p>CIS estimates the U.S. illegal immigrant population has dropped from 12.5 million in 2007 to 10.8 million now.</p>
<p>I get so sick and tired of seeing this EXTREMELY LOW FIGURE of 12 million illegals-there has to be that many alone in TEXAS.  The lamestream media has been saying 12 million for about the past 8 years or so while everyday more and more illegals are entering the country.  Even the PEW reports said there were 16 MILLION children of illegals born here.  Every single one of them including their offspring should be loaded up and carted out of this country and NEVER allowed back in.  There are 50 states in this country and they are ALL infested with illegals while there are now ghost towns in Meeheecoo due to abandonment from the MEEHEECUNS coming over here for all the free medical care, welfare, and jobs.  One talk show host, can&rsquo;t recall which, said there were 3 million AND their families residing in Texas alone.  There are millions in California.  North Carolina is overran and has the 5th largest illegal popultion in the country.  Tenessee is full of them and their illegal gangs.  12 million-give it a break!!!</p>

		<p>Alot of stories about the invaders going back. Here on Long Island their numbers seem to be on the increase, and it appears as if they have no plans of going anywhere. Slightly off the subject of this article: Accidentally stray into Iran and you will promptly be imprisoned.Set one foot into North Korea and you get 12 years hard labor. Secretly enter the United States, purchase and use forged documents, engage in an underground economy without any taxes,insurances or licenses and you get free food, free education, free medical, your children will have the same status as someone who has been here for generations,and generally a hands off policy on federal, state and local levels.</p>

		<p>Well, this is a type of war conducted with the economy and culture. America was swarmed with violent disease ridden illegals from an extremely gang infested culture.</p>
<p>American have been attacked by brutal job loss and the means of production and jobs outsourced internationally. The illegal immigrant population has been murdering, raping, attacking, menacing with gangs and political agitation.</p>
<p>Clearly America is under attack. The spectacle of US citizens railing against recalcitrant elected &#8220;representatives&#8221; at town hall meetings is stunning. Note as the representatives try to repeat the dull hypnotic mantra repeated on TV, Radio,the people reply with a loud NO! Americans are waking-up from the hypnotic trance. Yes it is true the political machine uses mass hypnosis, their speeches are clever scripts designed to entrance the ZOMBIE population.</p>
<p>At these abrasive town hall meetings it is blatantly obvious the contention between the officials and the population is startling and frankly frightening. The politicans obstinately refuse to abide by the people&rsquo;s will while repeating their hypnotic propaganda.</p>
<p>America is under attack. Socialism is upon us. As the government grows communism and fascism become a reality. </p>
<p>It is a spectacle indeed to behold this obvious class warfare between the political class and the thrid estate or peasants or mainstream if you will.</p>
<p>The illegal immigrants are just a tool. Their own countries have been destroyed by the same tactics. Why do the people suddenly appear in the political news at bizarre times?</p>
<p>America is in a strangle hold as the life is being throttled out of them they are awakening, confused and struggling for their lives. Yes struggling for our lives. Will they be able to break the Obama death grip, or will they succumb, eyes popping from their heads, tha last rasps, the town hall protests, a real astro turf death. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Concerned&#8221; is absolutely right about the &#8220;12 million illegals&#8221; figure being wrong. </p>
<p>To find the real number of illegal immigrants is to look at the total number of Hispanics: 45 million. </p>
<p>Subtract from this number the very few who actually stood in line, filled out papers, etc, and you have the Real number of &#8220;illegals&#8221; in our country.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Anchor babies&#8221; and their descendents, &#8220;Government Amnesties&#8221;,etc, Don&rsquo;t Count!!!</p>
<p>The &#8220;birth citizenship&#8221; law was Never intended to legalize &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; and &#8220;amnesties&#8221; were just lies and crimes perpetrated by our illigitimate &#8220;leaders&#8221;. </p>
<p>So, we probably have well over 40 million illegals in the country. </p>
<p>There are so many that our politicians now cater to them rather than us. </p>
<p>That makes them successful invaders and conquerers and us the conquered. </p>
<p>Look at Sotomeyer; she&rsquo;s a racist hispanic bigot marxist. Yet they will vote her in. So&hellip;we have been conquered. </p>
<p>All the numbers are a lie. The Media is a propaganda tool for Psychological Warfare against the American people, nothing more. </p>
<p>The Real American people are now waking up to the fact that while we slept, our country has been taken over from within. </p>

		<p>Anonymous quoted the LA Times in stating crime is dropping. The LA Times was proven to be going hand in hand with our Reconquista Mayor in promoting the lie that crime had dropped so much in Los Angeles that it was at 1957 levels. This turned out to be a falsehood and in fact crime is worse than ever. The County Jail is bursting at the seams as arrest levels keep rising, not dropping. The city is in chaos and the media, after being caught and trying to lay most of the blame on the police, simply keeps quiet. Sure, there&rsquo;s no conspiracy. </p>

		<p>Anonymous at 8:16 AM:  Good points, but don&rsquo;t forget illegals also get to use our courts if they ever wish to sue anybody!  Remember a few years ago that illegal alien drug runner at the Texas/Mexico border who was shot by the border guards and the royal treatment he was given by our judicial system!  But I have also heard of illegals hired by farmers who get injured by heavy machinery and sue and win, or who sue and win because they are injured in car accidents, so basically illegal aliens have the same rights as American citizens, only they don&rsquo;t have to pay taxes!</p>

		<p>#7 Why would these people have plans to go back? They have gold plated reasons to stay here vs. Mexico, simply because our treasonous government allows them to usurp Americans resources absolutely free. Most Americans haven&rsquo;t stopped for a second, to consider how insane, how gross, this whole thing is. </p>
