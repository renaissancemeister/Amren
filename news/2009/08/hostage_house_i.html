<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The mostly black residents of Dern Avenue in Compton got to witness the chaotic end to one of these journeys [from Guatemala to North America] last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The stucco box was a drop house for immigrant smugglers. The people inside  &mdash;  about 30 residents of Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador  &mdash;  had already paid thousands of dollars to get as far as Compton. Now the smugglers were demanding more money from their families.</p>
<p>They were locked in three rooms and held at bay by a pit bull, according to agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Their ranks included two boys from Ecuador, ages 7 and 9.</p>
<p>None of the neighbors had any inkling what was going on. The two guys renting the house seemed normal enough. &#8220;They were friendly,&#8221; said Alma Jackson, 60.</p>
<p>They mowed the front lawn and even had a Fourth of July barbecue in the frontyard, though Jackson noted: &#8220;It sure seemed like they were cooking a lot of food for just two people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, on July 27, the musician was sitting on the porch across the street when he saw a woman pulling back at the curtain. &#8220;I thought it was a little game they were playing, like hide and go seek.&#8221; When she started gesturing frantically, he walked across the street.</p>
<p>She threw out a piece of toilet paper with words written in Spanish. Unfortunately, the musician didn&rsquo;t read the language. &#8220;I could make out some words, like &#8216;polic√≠a,&rsquo;&#8221; he told me. He took the note to a Mexican family that lived nearby.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trapped inside this house, the note said. It gave a phone number for a U.S. relative to call for help. It also said: &#8220;Do NOT call the police.&#8221; But someone decided to call the police anyway.</p>
<p>When Los Angeles County sheriff&rsquo;s deputies arrived, the smugglers set loose the pit bull. The deputies shot the animal, as the hostages and smugglers sprinted out the doors and into the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>About a dozen people escaped into the dying heat of the late afternoon. They ran over crab grass lawns and into backyards, toward Avalon and El Segundo boulevards, disappearing into the city, seeking some Spanish-speaking person who might help them.</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Department detained three suspected smugglers  &mdash;  including one who bit a deputy on the leg  &mdash;  and turned over 17 people to immigration authorities.</p>
<p>A television crew entered the home and found a horrid stench of feces. Blood covered the floor of a bathroom where the wounded pit bull died. &#8220;The sheriffs pulled a rifle out of there too,&#8221; one resident said. Like the pit bull, the weapon was probably used to control the people inside.</p>
<p>The Ecuadorean boys were found hiding in a nearby abandoned house, residents said. One managed to tell them his story before the immigration authorities took him away.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jackson, a retired county employee, was shaken by what she had seen and heard. Her family moved to Compton in 1950, and was one of the first to integrate the mostly white block, she said. She grew up with Asians and Latinos, and had always thought of Compton as a place of opportunity. Now she&rsquo;s seen her neighborhood drawn into something evil.</p>
<p>The dark episode ended with the clanking of handcuffs as the immigration authorities led the detainees away.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Few immigrants realize that the thousands of dollars they pay to smugglers are just the down payment toward a larger ransom. Smugglers have been known to starve or maim their hostages to get more money out of their families, said Tracy Cormier, an assistant special agent in charge for the ICE in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The bigger the illicit profits, the more dangerous the criminals. Our Border Patrol agents live with this reality every day: On Friday, they buried one of their own, Agent Robert Rosas, who was killed by suspected smugglers near Campo, Calif.</p>
<p>Violence is becoming the defining trait of an illegal-immigrant trail that already denigrates and humiliates the people who choose to undertake it. It&rsquo;s an outrage that so much of the U.S. economy continues to feed off their suffering.</p>

		<p>May I&rsquo;m stupid, but somebody please help me figure this puzzle out: If these illegal immigrants are so poor, then how on earth can they afford to pay such large amounts of money to their smugglers?</p>

		<p>This situation calls for the death penalty even if the hostages were not killed. Running a slavery ring justifies the maximum penalty. But Obama lacks the guts and California, which needs the death penalty as much as Louisiana and Texas, prides itself on its &#8220;humanity&#8221;. The only one I feel sorry for here is the pit bull. Say, Michael Vick could get a job with these smugglers, being as he is a canine &#8220;expert&#8221;.</p>

		<p>1 Anon: I&rsquo;m guessing here, but maybe a whole family chips in to send one member to El Norte, who will then send back money.  Phillipinos do something similar when they groom one daughter to be married off to an American through an online &#8220;romance&#8221;, who then becomes a meal ticket for the whole family.  $200 bucks a month from relatives in the U.S. is a lot of money.</p>
