<h1>Vast Majority of Illegal Immigrants Arrested in Prince William Charged With One of Three Crimes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Sherfinski, Washington Examiner, August 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The vast majority of illegal immigrants arrested in Prince William County last year were charged with public drunkenness, driving under the influence or driving without a license, according to recent data.</p>
<p>Among 20 common crimes, such as vandalism and drug possession, arrests for the three crimes accounted for 76 percent of arrests of illegal immigrants (440 out of 576). Among all the persons arrested for those 20 crimes, the three charges constituted 48 percent of the arrests (5,064 out of 10,465), according to a report from the University of Virginia. The data sample was taken from March 2008 to December 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One difficulty with analyzing such statistics is that the illegal immigrant population is necessarily based on estimates. The report, citing a 2007 study, estimated that about 7 or 8 percent of Prince William&rsquo;s general population was made up of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Prince William County Police Department has held numerous community meetings to stress that the enforcement policy focuses on illegal immigrants who commit crimes, that crime victims and witnesses will be protected regardless of their immigration status, and that the department does not engage in racial profiling.</p>

<p>Correct me if I wrong but wasn&rsquo;t the same thing said about Irish and Italian people in America 100 years ago? Was there any calls to deprt them in large numbers like they want to do with hispanics and other people of color?</p>
<p>Oh wait - Irish and Italians are white so that makes everything ok.</p>

		<p>la rhonda:  yes there were calls to deport them and yes there were immigration restrictions implemented in 1922.  </p>
<p>These &#8220;people of color&#8221; will never become Americans, will only turn us into a third world h*ll hole and should be deported simply becuase they are not white.  Let us look at the nations they are leaving behind.  They couldn&rsquo;t build their own nations,  or they destroyed them, and now they want to come here.  Look at any &#8220;people of color&#8221; city in the US.  That is our future.</p>

<p>Yes,la rhonda,it does. White people can-and do meld together over a generation or so,and form a culture/society/whatever you want to call it. White people of Italian descent wind up drinking green beer on Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day,and white people of Irish descent order pizza a couple of times a month.</p>
<p>Even if there&rsquo;s some friction for a generation or two-and I&rsquo;ll certainly own up to the fact that there has been,and will probably continue to be friction,it doesn&rsquo;t last. White people from Germany have kids that go to school with the children of white people from Scotland,and they wind up getting married and having kids of their own,and after some years,everyone gets along just fine.</p>
<p>Not exactly the hood,where everybody is so busy keeping it real that they can&rsquo;t seem to find time to do things like go to school or show up on time for work,but speaking as one of the white folks,we like it that way.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it that way-and I have no idea if you do or do not-there&rsquo;s this thing called an airplane. You buy a ticket and get on the airplane,and it will take you just about anywhere in the world you think might be a better place. If you don&rsquo;t like airplanes,there are also things called boats,and things called trains,and things called buses. You can get on those things,and they&rsquo;ll take you someplace else,just like an airplane will,albeit a little slower.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of those people who happen to be black,and think you should stay because you deserve some kind of reparations for slavery,here&rsquo;s something to think about:</p>
<p>We white folks enslaved you,made you work,didn&rsquo;t pay your ancestors a nickel while they were busy toiling under our lash,and have refused to pay ever since. (Or at least that&rsquo;s what  I&rsquo;m told has happened.)</p>
<p>Well and good. Ever hear of writing off a bad investment? Or just quitting while you&rsquo;re ahead,or quitting while you aren&rsquo;t terribly far behind? Or not throwing good money after bad,or any of the other mostly sound pieces of one-line financial advice?</p>
<p>If us white folks haven&rsquo;t paid you in what&rsquo;s almost a century and a half,what makes you think we&rsquo;re going to pay up now? Why not get on an airplane,or a bus,or a train,or a boat,and go someplace else,where you won&rsquo;t have to look at all of us who owe you sooooooo much and never intend to even begin paying off the debt????</p>

		<p>     La Rhonda, It didn&rsquo;t take four hundred years for immigrant groups to assimilate. They did it and became law-abiding and productive citizens in one or two generations.</p>

		<p>#2 la rhonda, most people didn&rsquo;t drive cars a hundred years ago. Drunkeness was often punished regardless of what color you were depending on whether you lived in the city or country. Please stop talking about the still undeveloped America of one-hundred or more years ago. Irish and Italians of today, are still &#8220;white&#8221; to my knowledge and they don&rsquo;t get affirmative action, quotas, or are a protected group either. So, on and on we could go.</p>

<p>They were also here legally. You understand what &#8220;illegal immigrant&#8221; means don&rsquo;t you? Hispanic immigrants continue to denigrate and scapegoat whitey while living off the fruits of white civilization. They want to live here without respecting those who make their lives so privileged. America was, in its original conception and institutions, a white country and it&rsquo;s only by maintaining that aspect of its character that it has any hope of survival. <br/>

<p>The United States was founded by white people, and because it was an overwhelmingly white country it became the freest and most prosperous country in recorded history.</p>
<p>Culture follows race.  If you let enough Mexicans settle in your country you will wind up with another version of Mexico.  The same could be said of Salvadorans, Guatamalans, Haitians, sub-Saharan Africans, or people from Asia.</p>
<p>It is only natural for people to feel more comfortable amongst people who resemble them and share a comon culture.  This is but one reason why whites should never apologize for wanting to prevent non-white immigration.<br/>

		<p>Driving while drunk is no big deal in Latin Ameican countries,- its part of their culture. The same goes with public drunkeness. </p>
<p>Why obtain a license or register a car when the car drives just as well without these? Besides, they&rsquo;ll have to bale out or speed off anyway when they cause an accident since they&rsquo;re usually illegal. </p>
<p>When I worked hospital security in South Carolina two years ago it was almost always the same old story.</p>
<p>A white hit and run vicitim/family would be brought into the emergency room and we&rsquo;d learn from the police doing the report that the suspect was described as hispanic male who caused the accident and then fled either by car or foot. </p>

<p>So you would have us all believe that the above enumerated crimes were issues (or even had relevant statutes on the books) in 1909?  That there was a MADD in 1909? That operating a motor vehicle on the public highways without insurance in 1909 was, as a practical matter, socially irresponsible?  You need to go tune up your rhetorical (and spell check) skills girlfriend.</p>

<p>First of all &#8220;LaRhonda&#8221;, they didn&rsquo;t have drunk driving 100 years ago because there were no cars. Secondly, LaRhonda the numbers of Irish and Italian immigrants were very small compared to today, they were here legally and did not get welfare or cause large scale crime. Yes, they were White and as opposed to Mexicans, that makes a difference. You see LaRhonda, race matters, as you know. Mexicans of whom the majority are non-White, see themselves in racial terms, as do  others. Mexicans and others advocate for their own race and look out for their racial interests. You are racist for expecting Whites to not do the same and it is bad for Whites to be displaced by Mexicans who will push us aside for their own race.</p>

<p>You are wrong. Two out of the three crimes in question (drunk driving and driving without a license) did not really exist in 1909. This is the typical ahistorical, irrelevant response of ill-read liberals: someone is rumored to have said something about someone a century ago, therefore similar complaints about contemporary matters are illegitimate. The remarkable weakness of this logic is obscured only by the frequent repetition of the non-argument.</p>
<p>In any case what matters is not what two groups  &mdash;  Italians and Irish on the one hand, illegal mestizos on the other  &mdash;  may have in common but what distinguishes them. The Italians and Irish have demonstrated beyond cavil that they are up to the demands of citizenship in a modern, Western democracy. The mestizos have demonstrated that they are not capable of citizenship in a first-world nation. In fact they are moving backwards, exactly the opposite cultural and economic trajectory of every European immigrant population.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;problem&#8221; is not people of &#8220;color&#8221; but rather people of &#8220;behavior&#8221; bad behavior that is, in form of rape, theft, robbery, murder, breaking and entering,driving under the influence, and on and on etc etc.</p>

		<p>I see &#8220;la rhonda&#8221; is back and all the posters responding to the troll. So, I&rsquo;ll add my 2 cents&hellip; White nationalities can meld together in one Nation, as if you didn&rsquo;t know. NON-whites do not and cannot, period.</p>
