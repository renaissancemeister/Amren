			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren Kornreich, CNN, August 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Republican congresswoman apologized Thursday for saying that her party is looking for a &#8220;great white hope&#8221; to counteract President Obama&rsquo;s political agenda.</p>
<p>Kansas Rep. Lynn Jenkins told the Lawrence Journal-World that she did not intend to make a racist comment, and was simply saying that &#8220;Republicans have been suffering in recent years and we need a bright light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;{snip} [Jenkins said,] &#8220;I was unaware of any negative connotation. If I offended somebody, obviously I apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenkins had been criticized for saying at an August 19 forum in Kansas that the GOP needs &#8220;to find the great white hope&#8221; to help the party succeed in the future.</p>

		<p>But it&rsquo;s the truth.  The GOP is done in its current configuration.  Unless it becomes an explicitly white racialist party, yeah, it might win some elections, and make the occasional gain, but the overall long term trend will still be toward irrelevance.</p>

		<p>Ha ha! You have to love something this addled! She&rsquo;s subconsciously a race realist, I suppose.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m somewhat serious. While some whites are waking up, I think a greater number are becoming racially agitated just under the level of full consciousness of what they&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>So, a Freudian slip? (I do believe in Freud that much).</p>

While I support anyones right to say anything, one has to wonder how people in political office today can be completely unaware of the implications of the words and ideas they use in public.</p>
<p>I was talking to a friend of mine a few weeks back. I asked him if our past politicians used to be greater men as can be surmised from their writing and quotes or if history has only made them appear as such by distilling, preserving, and promoting only their best work.</p>

		<p>Rep. Jenkins should just tell the media to use a little even-handedness in its reporting. </p>
<p>Given the countless blind eyes turned on Cynthia McKinney&rsquo;s ridiculous shenanigans, absolutely nothing can be off-limits for Rep. Jenkins. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Republicans have been suffering in recent years and we need a bright light&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberals better keep an eye on this one. Now she&rsquo;s Really being insensitive. Isn&rsquo;t her apology as &#8216;racist&rsquo; as her original statement? </p>
<p>Sometimes, victims of black crime are called &#8216;people of light&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a phrase thrown around here a few times!</p>

		<p>She is absolutely correct.  The Republicans need something because thanks in part to George Bush and largely to John McCain, I can barely see the difference between the Republicans and the Dummiecrats.  </p>
<p>Of course, had a black congresswoman or congressman told the reporter that &#8220;we need a great black hope&#8221;, nothing would have been made of the comment. </p>

		<p>Why not just simplify things and delete the word &#8220;white&#8221; from our vocabulary altogether? It seems to be the most vile, hateful word known in the English language, standing for racism, bigotry, intolerance, discrimination, oppression, etc., etc. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be the PC thing to do? </p>

		<p>She already screwed up, by apologizing. I&rsquo;ve said it a thousand times  &mdash;  anyone putting their faith in the GOP, to look out for white interests, agianst the Democrats denigration of those interests, is deluded. HIGHLY DELUDED.</p>

		<p>Does she really believe she will get the black vote by apologizing?  </p>
<p>She should have used the opportunity to state that most of her constituency is in the white community and that they feel disenfranchised by both paries.  She should have stated that since the black candidates overwhelmingly support affirmative action, she was expressing hope for a white candidate that will counter balance that discrimination.</p>
<p>Had she said that, she would have shot up in the polls and stature.  Instead she chose the path of pandering to people that have no intention of voting for her.  </p>

		<p>The absurd oversensitivity and professional victim status of blacks combined with the blatant greed of our elected criminals has driven political correctness beyond even the ludicrous bounds we&rsquo;ve become familiar with. Now we must weigh every single use of half the words in the English vocabulary. We have to substitute words for harmless descriptive words, historical phrases, even legendary works of art, lest we commit the unforgivable sin of &#8216;First Degree Offending&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Rep. Jenkins fits perfectly in The Obama Apology Tour.</p>

		<p>Many Whites seem to be embarrassed to be alive.  The Frankfurt School and others have been indoctrinating Americans for generations.  Of course, that is their plan: the &#8220;soft totalitarian revolution&#8221;.  Words are part of the plan.  The PC Enforcers have invented psychological words ( name calling) which when used have the effect of the making the opposition apologize.   First it was PC and now &#8220;hate speech&#8221;.  Just a way to rob people of their free speech.  Whites need to disregard this psychological name calling and stand up for themselves while they still can.  </p>
