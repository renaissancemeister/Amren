<h1>A Call for Diversity at the Capitol</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Johnson, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), August 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A black or Native American child visiting the state Capitol on a school field trip can wander among the statues, monuments and plaques without seeing an image of someone of the same skin color.</p>
<p>What the student could see is a statue of former Gov. Charles Brantley Aycock, a leading spokesman for the white supremacy campaigns of 1898 and 1900 that were marked by violence and voter intimidation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the statue of Andrew Jackson, who oversaw the forced removal of Native Americans from their homelands in the 1830s, the infamous &#8220;Trail of Tears&#8221; march that killed thousands.</p>
<p>Eddie Davis, a former teacher and former head of the state&rsquo;s largest teachers union, calls it &#8220;segregated history in the 21st century.&#8221; He is proposing that the state Capitol in downtown Raleigh, built with the help of slave labor, reflect and represent all of its people, including those who aren&rsquo;t white, about a quarter to one-third of the population.</p>
<p>He asked members of the state Historical Commission last week to add a &#8220;Hall of Inclusion&#8221; on the second floor of the Capitol, with plaques recognizing historical contributions by racial and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Capitol grounds feature 14 statues. Inside, an equal number of statues, busts and plaques salute the state&rsquo;s three signers of the Declaration of Independence, former governors, veterans and the &#8220;51 ladies&#8221; who organized the Edenton tea party in 1774.</p>
<p>Among the statues, only the Vietnam War veterans memorial on the east grounds depicts a minority. The three soldiers include a black and a Lumbee Indian, according to Keith Hardison, director of the division of state historic properties.</p>
<p><b>Too much clutter?</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about numbers, though, said John Sanders, an author and researcher on the Capitol who is retired from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&rsquo;s School of Government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;To convert the state Capitol to a showcase for one cause, however worthy,&#8221; Sanders told the commission, &#8220;would open it up as a showcase for other causes. Its significance as a local historic landmark would be compromised.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Disputes elsewhere</b></p>
<p>The discussion about North Carolina&rsquo;s Capitol bears little resemblance to the uproar that grew out of South Carolina removing a Confederate flag from its Capitol nearly a decade ago. But similar debates about representation have flared in other state capitals and in Washington.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re changing as a society, and down the road there will be monuments to Hispanic leaders,&#8221; said Bill Ferris, a UNC-CH history professor and former director of the National Endowment for the Humanities. &#8220;Monuments are a way of making people feel that their families have been honored and included in a special way.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Commission members sounded as divided last week as the presenters at their meeting. One member questioned whether people ought to be remembered by their accomplishments rather than a statue, while another member suggested that minorities visiting the Capitol are marginalized.</p>

<p>Laughably, this is the usual illiterate multicultural rubbish written (or should it be &ldquo;wroted&rdquo;) by the typical Marxist imbecile. Comrade Johnson seems to think that &ldquo;a black and a Lumbee Indian,&rdquo; only make up the depiction of &ldquo;a minority&rdquo; and not members from two groups of them. That is after all, the type of grammatical mistake one would expect from a backward second grader, not a paid &ldquo;journalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

<p>But not for building North Carolina but rather for conquering North Carolina, destrying it and making it &#8220;Latino&#8221;.</p>

		<p>But if blacks and hispanics didn&rsquo;t make any big contributions throughout certain parts of history, what sense would it make to &#8220;include&#8221; them in something they weren&rsquo;t a part of?  I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>

		<p>In reality, this concern is presently falsely.  The real aim is for the conquerors to assert themselves by removing the statues and symbols of the Anglo-American race and replacing them with the statues and symbols of the new regime.</p>
<p>Christians did this when they came into power in Rome and it was they who for example, tore down the Acropolis and the Parthenon as well as the remaining Seven Wonders of the Ancient world. Interestingly, the communist movement seized upon this tradition wherever it arose, only to see most of those statues and symbols removed in turn as those regimes failed.  However, the hodge-podge of races and creeds that will compete in the post Anglo-American nation will eventually tear one anothers statues and symbols down daily.  Chaos will reign and only strongmen will stabalize the situation for the length of their own lives as in Cuba and South America.</p>
<p>We need a new nation, this one is ruined.</p>

<p>and why might that be? could it be because the men who played a major role in America&rsquo;s and North Carolina&rsquo;s history were white? as i&rsquo;ve said before i live in Raleigh, NC and i would not mind seeing more statues of blacks or hispanics, provided that they played as great a role in our nations&rsquo; history as Andrew Jackson, the Confederate veterans, and the veterans of WW2.</p>

		<p>The frontlines of identity politics is in the public spaces.  </p>
<p>There is a modern surge in groups wanting to plant flags and erect monuments to their special interest.  The emphasis here is on permanence - for example the Chinese wanting a concrete archway leading into &#8216;Chinatown&rsquo;, or the Indians wanting a statue of Gandhi in a public park on a massive pedestal, or Muslims bulding a mosque with minarets.  </p>
<p>These cultural markers are built of bricks and mortar and bronze and are meant to say, &#8220;Look at us.  We&rsquo;re here, we&rsquo;ve claimed your land, and even though we&rsquo;ve displaced you, we intend not to be displaced. These are our fortifications and flags we and our descendants will rally around.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if one of those commission members would say - &#8220;okay, okay we give, we&rsquo;ll put up a statue of a black thug raping a White woman.&#8221; Anyway, when are non-Whites going to get it through their thick heads that this country WAS NOT built by them, for them or with them in mind! Besides manual labor, Blacks and all other non-Whites contributed VERY little to what this country was. Notice I said WAS, because now blacks and other non-Whites ARE contributing to the downfall of this country. Allot of horses and mules also contributed their labor to build this country, are we suppose to build monuments to them as well?  </p>

		<p>I think the monuments of Washington, DC should celebrate those who envisioned and then created the United States of America. Blacks and other races played virtually no role in this process and to pretend otherwise is to distort the facts of history.  </p>
<p>While blacks have been on the North American continent practically as long as whites they have contributed very little to the advancement of our civilization.  Quite the contrary, it&rsquo;s likely that they&rsquo;re an enormous net drain economically, socially, and culturally. The nation, not to put too fine a point on it, would be far better off in practically all respects were they not here at all. This is true of practically any nation they inhabit in significant numbers.</p>

		<p>Raleigh could erect a monument and some plaques to the memory of The Army&rsquo;s 24th Inf Regiment (Colored) sevice during the Korean War.  A high ranking Lt Colonel from the 24th Infantry Regiment refused deploy to the conflict, while a black Chaplain informed members of the regiment during a sermon that it was wrong for blacks to to fight orientals in Korea,  While awaiting movement to Korea in Gifu, Japan members of the regiment raped, robbed, and went AWOL.  Once in Korea the regiment continued this heritage and added fleeing from the enemy.  They proudly adopted the &#8220;Bugout Boogie&#8221; as their theme song.  Yes, the monuments and plaques would help balance out the city of Raleigh, NC.</p>

		<p>This is just a natural progression. We are being eradicated in all ways. Our history books, heroes and customs will all increasingly come under assault unless we as whites stand united against this outright destruction of us. From our founding fathers to the Alamo to Henry Ford et al. Every particle of whiteness and what it represents to &#8220;people of color&#8221; must be wiped out. </p>

		<p>Funny how they use &#8220;skin color&#8221;. &#8220;Race&#8221; is only selectively when convenient since they claim there is one human race when its convenient only. Why dont they ditch  &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;racism&#8221; and use &#8220;skin colorist&#8221; or &#8220;skin colorism&#8221; since they dont believe in 3 races? Forget physical traits like kinky hair, wide flat noses, small stubby ears, big bubble lips and bubble rumps, etc etc. What about todays misegenated world where many blacks are lighter than whites not to mention non-misegenated red/yellows who are many times genetically whiter than whites too? Bronze statues are the same color so how could you differentiate unless the artist creates the differences using known race traits? </p>

		<p>I knew that it was just a matter of time before the diversity hounds and blacks would start on Washington DC and it&rsquo;s &#8220;white&#8221; monuments to &#8220;white&#8221; guys.  It&rsquo;s not enough that they are building the MLK memorial smack dab in the middle of of the Mall and it&rsquo;s not enough that they have their own African-American Musuem.  They want IT ALL!!!  Which just goes to prove that the more you give them, the more they want.  They don&rsquo;t want a piece of history in Washington DC they want it all.   And they aren&rsquo;t going to stop until enough people say enough is enough.</p>

		<p>      As our numbers and inluence dwindle, naturally our flags and monuments will be put off in a corner if not thrown down. And naturally, steets and schools will be renamed. No people have a past who do not have a future-it works the other way too.<br>
      John PM: The Occidental Quarterly announced the winner of the essay contest. Michael O&rsquo;Meara won with a well written essay in favor of succession. Although respectful, he takes Sam Francis to task for his hanging on to not just Paleo Conservative ideas, but even plain old Conservative ideas in face of the crisis. O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s focus is not a cost/benefit analysis-the cost is going to be huge no matter which way we go. But rather a risk/benefit analysis. And the risk of not attempting succession outweights the risk of succession. Our prospects don&rsquo;t look too good, but at least we have a chance of coming through by attempting succession. We have no chance of taking back America with a huge and growing minority population, a dumbed down lumpen White population, and two entrenched parties of Globalist Anti-Whites in power.</p>

In fact in 2002, this same group identity politics came into full view when a 19 foot bronze statue of a Hispanic, Black, and White fire fighters was going to be made lifting an American flag over the ruins of the World Trade Center buildings   &mdash;   just like the picture with three White fire fighters lifting the American flag over the remains of the WTC.</p>

<p>The separate coloured <i>minorities</i> will be fighting it out amongst themselves soon enough.   I doubt if any of them will continue genuflecting to Marxist Political Correctness and its ethnic warfare tool of twisted symantics, for very long.</p>
<p>Instead, the only interpretation  of <i>diversity</i> the <i>minorities</i> are collectively likely to be interested in, is the triumph of one over another and this means they&rsquo;ll be getting right down to <i>business as usual</i> sooner or later, ie, initiating ethnic bloodletting and wholesale anarchy across the continent.</p>

<p>Your sentiments actually tend to give way to the Marxist Liberal fallacious denial of race reality and thus play into their hands.  We mustn&rsquo;t do that.  </p>
<p>Racism is, in actual fact, <b>natural</b> since the word denotes normal discrimination and subsequent <b>natural</b> survial instinct between separate ethnicities and their respective heritages and cultures. </p>
<p>What people forget is that Marx invented the term to be deliberately synonomous with hate and thus discrimination based on that alleged hate.</p>
<p>The term must be properly reclaimed by all races and its true and natural meaning restored.  </p>
<p>Non-white races, no doubt, presently believe the term in its present form, bears no FUTURE threat to them simpy because they are non-white.</p>
<p>They had better think again!<br>
