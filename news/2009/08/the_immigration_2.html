	<p>American attitudes toward immigration are hardening, according to a new Gallup poll. Half of all Americans say immigration should be &#8220;decreased&#8221;  &mdash;  up 11 points from 39 percent last year.</p>
<p>Anti-immigration sentiment is growing across all major political groupings. Some 61 percent of Republicans say they would like to see immigration decreased, up from 46 percent in 2008, compared to 46 percent of Democrats, up from 39 percent; and 44 percent of Independents, up from 37 percent.</p>
<p>Southerners show the greatest anti-immigration sentiment with 54 percent saying they would like to see immigration decreased, followed by easterners (51 percent), midwesterners (48 percent), and westerners (44 percent).</p>
<p>The poll also saw a shift in American attitudes toward whether &#8220;immigration is a good or a bad thing for the country&#8221; with more than a third (36 percent) saying it is a bad thing.</p>
<p>Gallup notes that this marks &#8220;a return to the attitudes that prevailed in the first few years after 9/11.&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/122057/Americans-Return-Tougher-Immigration-Stance.aspx?CSTS=alert">Americans Return to Tougher Immigration Stance</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Lymari Morales, Gallup Poll, August 5, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}, Gallup finds Americans less favorable toward immigration than they were a year ago. Half (50%) say immigration should be decreased, up from 39% last year. A third (32%) say immigration levels should be kept the same, down from 39%, and 14% say they should be increased, down from 18%.</p>
<p>The most recent results, from a Gallup survey conducted July 10-12, 2009, mark a return to the attitudes that prevailed in the first few years after 9/11; attitudes softened from 2006 to last year. The shift toward a tougher stance this time around may reflect the country&rsquo;s economic situation, as Americans tend to become less pro-immigration during difficult economic times.</p>
<p>{snip} Currently, 58% say it is a good thing  &mdash;  the lowest percentage saying so since 2003. The historical low for this measure, 52%, came in 2002, after the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 61% of Republicans who now say they would like to see immigration decreased is up from 46% in 2008. At the same time, the 46% of Democrats and 44% of independents who would like to see immigration decreased represent shifts in the same direction, up from the 39% and 37%, respectively, who said the same in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip} Americans in the South (54%) are the most likely to want immigration decreased, while those in the West (44%) are relatively less likely to say the same. Here again, each group has shifted toward a more anti-immigration stance.</p>
<p>Bottom Line</p>
<p>Americans have returned to a tougher stance on immigration than has been evident for the past few years. Republicans, in particular, have shifted most strongly toward decreasing immigration, with Democrats and independents moving in the same direction, but to a lesser degree. Thus, as lawmakers consider when and how to pursue immigration reform, they should do so mindful that Americans of all political persuasions are generally more resistant to immigration in broad measure than they were a year ago.</p>

<p>Interesting numbers, but what do they really mean?</p>
<p>What they really mean, is that most Americans are idiots and those who normally vote Republican, are only mildly less nitwitted!</p>
<p>This country is overpopulated with about: 75 million nonwhite interlopers; 32 million ex-slaves &ldquo;of color;&rdquo; and by my best guess, roughly 10 to 15 million hardcore multicultural Reds. Thus, before any future immigration into esthe country should even be ever considered again, between 117 and 122 people must be expelled or otherwise dealt with. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just illegal migration, legal immigration is way out of control. No country can afford to keep on allowing mass immigration constantly. We don&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t have the resources, or jobs etc. to support a constantly growing population. Right now, we are in a recession and immigration during this time should be abolished. </p>

		<p>I started following the immigration issue about ten years ago. There were similar poll results back then. I figured democracy would prevail and the problem would be solved quickly. After a few years nothing was happening but I was patient. Still no action. Five years ago I decided that democracy would not prevail and that the only solution was in helping whites develop a white racial identity. That&rsquo;s when I joined AmRen. I&rsquo;ve introduced about a hundred people to AmRen since then. I&rsquo;m not talented or rich enough to do more than that but I feel good to have helped in the movement. </p>

		<p>Let us be grateful for small blessings. The third world countries nearest the U. S. are Latin American. Thus our post-American political and judicial elites have not been able to use mass third world immigration to quite the same effect as in Europe. </p>
<p>This from a New York Times review of  &#8220;REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION IN EUROPE: Immigration, Islam, and the West By Christopher Caldwell, July 30, 3009: </p>
<p>&#8220;Through decades of mass immigration to Europe&rsquo;s hospitable cities and because of a strong disinclination to assimilate, Muslims are changing the face of Europe, perhaps decisively. These Muslim immigrants are not so much enhancing European culture as they are supplanting it. The products of an adversarial culture, these immigrants and their religion, Islam, are &#8216;patiently conquering Europe&rsquo;s cities, street by street.&rsquo;&#8221;:<br>

		<p>I find  these polls hard to believe.  Having followed the immigration debacle for many years it seems (according to other polls) that a consistent 60-65% of Hispanics, 75-80% of whites and 90% of blacks want immigration reduced or stopped.</p>

		<p>Note how people who are mostly just against illegal immigration once again become &#8220;anti-immigrant&#8221;.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I doubt the people polled are against reasonable levels of immigration of intelligent, productive, law-abiding potential future citizens.  It&rsquo;s the welfare sucking, job-stealing, baby-popping, anti-American criminal classes they are concerned about.</p>

		<p>This country takes in more people than any other nation in the world. We not only have over a million legal immigrants each year, we have the alphabet of visa holders, refugees from countries with real or imagined persecutions, the wet foot, dry foot fiasco, the resettlements and any number of those who will be a drain on our society. Since we pour money into most countries of the world, while our own nation is in the worst ecomomic downturn since the great depression, it seems that we could stop importing so many. Help them make their own countries economically feasible so they can remain there rather than forcing disparate societies to live together. This brings about all sorts of problems. We need a moratorium on all immigration until we get the last batch assimilated. And our leaders need to get a backbone and demand that illegals leave or face the consequences. Let Mexico and the other offenders yell, we have the law on our side.</p>

<p>And yet the composition of that &#8220;half of all Americans&#8221; has changed over the last few decades due to the government&rsquo;s open-borders policy. In other words, the view of &#8220;half of all Americans&#8221; changes as the demographics of the country change. </p>

		<p>58% say it is a good thing? Who are these people? It&rsquo;s one thing to take in the best and brightest. It is completely different when you take in any illiterate peasant who can manage to make &#8220;his mark&#8221; on a sheet of paper. After all, what possible benefit can millions of illiterate peasants, many of whom have never used a toilet, have on a modern technological society? NONE!!! And I am talking about LEGAL immigration. That 58% needs to get their heads out and take a look around. Our current immigration system encourages the worst non-whites, and most useless to immigrate here. Then prop them up with welfare. In the worst case, they are a few hours plane ride back home. There is no risk to them like the European immigrants of the past where it took weeks to get here, was expensive, and there was no social safety net. Work or starve. In fact, records show 40% of Europeans went home after 2 years. I bet less than 1% return home nowadays.</p>
<p>Even ignoring the quality of the immigrants, over-population is not a good thing. When do we put out the no vacancy sign? When we are at 500M or 1B? We have perfect examples of the quality of life in countries with dense populations. The Census bureau predicts the US population to exceed 500M by mid century and approach 1B by the turn of the century. Those levels of population will destroy the wide open spaces we enjoy. Add in congestion and pollution. You know the effects. And once you reach a 1B population it is too late to control or remedy. The organic growth (native births) alone becomes unsustainable. A modest.5% increase on 1B is 5M people a year added. It is no longer about porportions, it is about sheer numbers. We better wake up or the US will be a sewer in 100 years at most. Where the water is undrinkable and we can not grow enough food domestically to feed the populaiton. Add the fact that all of the growth comes from these 3rd world peasant immigrants and you have a disaster.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration is no brainer and should not even have to be discussed in sane society. Eliminate the magnets that draw and keep them here (jobs/welfare/citizenship) and they will leave eventually. Those that don&rsquo;t get 5 years hard labor. But legal immigration needs to be reduced to 100K/year at most. Even better, a 10 year moratorium followed by moderate numbers. Otherwise, you can kiss this country and its freedoms goodbye my friends.  What&rsquo;s worse, this problem is of our own making. Completely preventable if only folks would wake up.</p>

		<p>I spent a week recently in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The entire underbelly of the economy is Mexican. Wyoming! Not Arizona or California. Now I know that there are some whites who are genuinely not made uncomfortable having to mix with a &#8220;diverse&#8221; population. But they are a distinct minority. They have to be. It&rsquo;s human nature to be comfortable amongst your own and uncomfortable when surrounded by the other. The worst part of it all is that human beings can live with discomfort for a long long time. We adjust. And adjusts. And adjusts. So, for all I know, this situation of horrible diversity everywhere may just be tolerated. But if a breaking point comes it will come all over the country because that&rsquo;s the state we&rsquo;ve reached. It, or rather They, are everywhere now.  </p>

		<p>I believe that legal immigration is now set at about 2 million, give or take a couple hundred thousand, people a year. Before fifty years ago, it was a steady one-hundred fifty thousand people a year. This was when American manufacturing was going full speed, in almost every industry. Todays level of immigration doesn&rsquo;t make sense from either an environmental nor and economic point of view, both supposedly, Democratic and Republican issues.</p>
<p>This is the reason I always say that the present accepted level of immigration, is set by people with an anti-American agenda. It must have occured at some point to the geniuses in charge, that the various industries that would justify filling up the U.S. with two million people a year,are gone. All of this doesn&rsquo;t even consider the insane numbers represented by illegal immigration.</p>

		<p>The poll is deceptive in a way that tends to obscure the extent to which the majority wants immigration stopped. In the first place, the use of &#8216;increased&rsquo; or &#8216;decreased&rsquo; tends to confuse if you are answering fast. Also, if you are asking for &#8216;decreased&rsquo; immigration, you are still saying you want more immigrants. They could have asked, &#8220;Do you want more immigrants in the country, fewer immigrants in the country, or the same number of immigrants in the country?&#8221;, or &#8220;Do you want immigrants to come here faster than they are now, slower than they are now, or at the same rate they are now?&#8221;. </p>
