	<p>A $200 back-to-school giveaway for needy kids sparked a mad rush for money on the streets of New York on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s free money!&#8221; said Alecia Rumph, 26, who waited in a Morris Park, Bronx, line 300 people deep for the cash to buy uniforms and book bags for her two kids.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God for Obama. He&rsquo;s looking out for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thousands of people lined up at banks and check-cashing shops to withdraw the cash that magically appeared on their electronic benefit cards.</p>
<p>Some rushed out because of rumors the money would vanish by the end of the day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The no-strings-attached money went to families receiving food stamps or welfare.</p>
<p>Every child between 3 and 17 was eligible for $200, which worked out to 813,845 kids across the state  &mdash;  including 498,866 in the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Billionaire philanthropist George Soros gave $35 million toward the program, with $140 million in federal stimulus funds routed through state government making up the rest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gov. Paterson and Mayor Bloomberg joined Soros to announce the payments at Public School 208 in Harlem, where the billionaire reminisced that as a penniless student in London, he survived because of a handout he got from Quakers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paterson&rsquo;s Republican critics blasted the giveaway, saying he should spend the money to reduce property taxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a plan that is ripe for fraud and abuse,&#8221; said Senate Republican leader Dean Skelos. &#8220;This is a totally irresponsible use of federal stimulus money.&#8221;<br>

		<p>George Soros gave a lot of money to Obama (and McCain, too), so why did he only give $35 million, when he could have given the $140 million that we gave?  How much of this money will actually be spent on back to school supplies?  </p>

		<p>Wait till King Obama calls for reparations for slavery   &mdash;   and the money comes from White people&rsquo;s bank accounts and retirement plans.  Of course we&rsquo;ll all have to add a notation to our bank records first just so the government knows exactly who is White.</p>

		<p>Money that should go to people with productive ideas and businesses that employ people is diverted so that more cell phones and XBoxes can be purchased. Whatever. </p>
<p>The Greatest Inflation of All Time is Coming, as a result of Hussein Obama&rsquo;s give away programs and his stooge Bernanke monetizing the trillions of dollars in debt. These dumb idiots who thank Obama for their $200 don&rsquo;t realize that this sum will be worth about fifty cents soon. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what Soros&rsquo; game is other than to keep him floating while others sink.</p>

		<p>While passing through Harlem on the bus yesterday (I live in Washington Heights)I saw a huge mob of people crowded in a small check cashing shop and I wondered what the heck they could all be doing. All their kids were running around on the sidewalk and the line went out the door and took up the whole block. Well, this is sad, and worse than what I would&rsquo;ve expected it to be.</p>

		<p>This story when i heard it today struck me as the worst case of out of control spending i ever heard of. I believe a chap named Tyler said 200 years ago that taxpayers voting themselves the largesse of the treasury was the earmark for a dead democracy&hellip;.always followed by a dictatorship.</p>

		<p>If they had spent $175 Million on programs for gifted students, in 15 years we would have cured AIDS &amp; cancer, solved global warming and the energy crisis, and had colonies on Mars.  </p>
<p>Instead they spent it on the least-productive and least capable segment of society.  What will this $175 Million accomplish?  Exactly the same thing that Billions and Billions and Billions of Dollars spent on low-class Minorities have accomplished during the last 50 years: More crime, more high-school dropouts, more teenage unwed mothers, more prison riots, more ethnic tension, and more urban blight and pathological behavior among these people.  Don&rsquo;t believe me?  Then check the stats for New York State 10 years from now and see if there is any improvement.  I guarantee there will not be.   </p>

**********************<br>
You don&rsquo;t have to be on welfare to know this.  You can be a cashier at a grocery, like I was.  The EBT cards have been around for quite a while, they are used just as anyone would use a debit card, PIN number and all.  They buy &#8220;food&#8221; (pop, chips, candy) with the foodstamp account and anything they want on the cash account.  Same card, just press the right button when checking out.<br>
They are meant to give the recipients &#8220;dignity&#8221;.</p>

<p>Another reason why food stamps were EBTized is because too many blacks (and others) were trading food stamps for a lesser amount of money, so that they could use the money to buy drugs or alcohol.  However, doing so hasn&rsquo;t completely eliminated the fraud.</p>

		<p>@ 16 Kitty.  The idea of &#8220;dignity&#8221; when the switch was made to EBT may have been the publicly stated goal.  But a benefit from switching away from food stamps to the car is: the funds on the card can be spent but once.</p>
<p>I was stationed in Puerto Rico in 1980.  Food Stamps were virtually a parallel currency to the US dollar back then.  I saw them used for everything from car parts to &#8220;services&#8221; provided by the ladies of the streets.  The stamps were used openly in this illegal fashion, but no one bothered to enforce the regs, because &#8220;el norte&#8221; was giving them this money that they &#8220;deserved&#8221; because they were &#8220;oppressed&#8221;.</p>
<p>That, and no matter the location, the stamps were often sold for as little as 25 cents on the dollar for wine and dope money.</p>

		<p>I need another bite at the apple here, Amren.</p>
<p>Both Question Diversity and JewAmongYou2 are absolutely correct.  I was certainly aware of all the fraud under the old system and that &#8220;dignity&#8221; was the publicly stated goal, but the new system still didn&rsquo;t do much to curtail the abuses which go on.</p>
<p>&#8220;That, and no matter the location, the stamps were often sold for as little as 25 cents on the dollar for wine and dope money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, and these days they just sell the whole card along with the PIN number, I&rsquo;ve seen it many times.  And let&rsquo;s not get into dishonest merchants, they get around it too.<br>
