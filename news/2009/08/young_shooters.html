			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Darlena Taylor-Bonds, Detroit Examiner, August 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Typically a 12 year old would be at home in the bed, but not this 12 year old. The average 12 year old child is looking forward to summer vacation from school, looking forward to hanging out with friends and doing what children do. But instead, Demarco Harris has been charged with felony murder and armed robbery in the Aug. 1 slaying of Trisha Babcock.</p>
<p>Trisha Babcock, a 24-year-old woman from Davison was shot shortly after midnight as she sat in a car with a man at West Outer Drive and Minock. Wayne County prosecutors charged Harris on Saturday in juvenile court under a state law that gives the judge discretion to impose an adult sentence if the child is convicted.</p>
<p>Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy called the crime &#8220;very scary.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Serious,&#8221; but said she is not ruling out a plea that would keep the 6-foot-2 youth in juvenile custody. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new law just implemented in the City of Eastpointe, Michigan will have other cities considering whether or not it&rsquo;s not a bad idea. Eastpointe, Michigan implemented the Parent Responsibility law, if a child commits a crime, the city will charge the parents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obviously there is a problem, because why was Harris on the streets at midnight to begin with? Harris was not alone, a second juvenile suspect is in custody on other charges, police said, but has not been charged in the shooting. Detroit Police Chief Warren Evans said Wednesday, &#8220;We are confident that the 12-year-old was the shooter.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p> You can bet that there will be hordes of blacks trying to get him off as easily as possible, and trying to get the lightest charge that is possible.I am glad that it is not the 1970s anymore, when the worst that could happen to him would for him to be held until age 25.</p>

		<p>As our government attempts to disperse inner-city poor among predominately White communities, via Section 8 Housing, &#8220;anti-discrimination&#8221; laws, and Third-World re-settlement programs, prepare for much, much more of this sort of thing.  It used to be that most Black-on-white crime happened in or close to the &#8220;ghetto.&#8221;  However, now there will be NO safe communities, except, of course, the gated and guarded communities inhabited by our elite governmental officials, business CEOs and Hollywood liberals.  They and their families will be well protected from the mayhem as they continue to proclaim the great benefits of diversity, for the rest of us. </p>

		<p>A 12 year old out after midnight. This is common in inner city black neighborhoods. I&rsquo;ve lived in them, and to see even small black children out playing on a sidewalk at midnight is as common as gunshots, gangs, and street drugs.   </p>

		<p>Started to read the condolences. I myself have a habit of writing in to these when ever someone I vaugely knew dies.  I like to leave a sincere positive impression of whatever the deceased shared with me, no matter how little. Then it hit me! We as a &#8220;community&#8221; seem to come together more in death than in life. Maybe we should start reaching out before the tragedy instead of after. Safety in numbers instead of sharing the burden, so to speak.</p>

		<p>Good Lord, this thug -oops- &#8216;yuf&rsquo; is 12 yrs. old and he&rsquo;s 6ft2!!! Anyway - I don&rsquo;t think we have a horse in this race folks. This White gal was in Detroit trying to become a &#8220;dancer&#8221;. She was shot while sitting in a car with a man shortly after mid-night. And just what color do you think that man was? No, she was NOT one of us.</p>

		<p>In a just world, &#8220;Demarco&#8221; would be executed with the proceedings broadcast into the undoubtedly no account public &#8220;school&#8221; he attended. At the moment of hanging(we can dream, can&rsquo;t we?) he would be told he is executed for senseless murder and because he has a loser name like Demarco.</p>

		<p>This poor girl came from Davison, a small and beautiful town far north of Detroit, but still an easy hour and a half drive.  It&rsquo;s where mega-lefty film mogul Michael Moore owns a sprawling estate.  That being said, it&rsquo;s easy to understand how this naive white girl can believe that &#8220;blacks aren&rsquo;t bad and I&rsquo;m not a racist&#8221;. Schools teach such things and they aren&rsquo;t allowed to teach otherwise. </p>
<p>I know the area the article mentions. It&rsquo;s dangerous, filthy, third world, and anyone can buy a large brick house there for around 2 to 5 grand. It&rsquo;s also all black as far as racial composition. </p>
<p>Another lesson in race learned in the most painful way possible. I can&rsquo;t even imagine the pain her parents are going through right now. I think everyone reading the article should pray for them.  </p>

		<p>My God, they continue to kill our people!  The 6&rsquo;-2&#8221; 12 year old is a murderer clear and simple.  We could send a strong message and proceed to execute.  However, most likely he will be free by the time he is in his twenties.</p>
<p>One of our posters, calls our people to act but acknowledges that we probably will not.  These crimes our waking us up.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll be surprised if this &#8220;child&#8221; gets life in prison. I saw an episode just today on American Justice where a 12 yr. old black child beat to death a 6 yr. old black child, and the defense was he was play acting like professional wrestlers, and didn&rsquo;t understand the fatal injuries he was inflicting. All 35 of them.<br>
He served only 3 years.</p>
<p>The defense here will be this poor &#8220;child&#8221; has had no parental guidance, and that society has failed him, and it&rsquo;s really not his fault, he didn&rsquo;t know any better. His sperm donor (if he can be found) and the woman who spawned him, should be held accountable. I won&rsquo;t call them his parents, because a true parent would not allow a 12 yr. old boy to run the streets at midnight with a gun. They are just as guilty of this crime as he is.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve had stories surfacing in the news of children GANG RAPING children. Children routinely MURDERING children. The common denominator? That these are Blacks. So why should we be shocked or even surprised here? Violence and irrational crime seems to be a deeply ingrained component of the Black psyche. That crime by Blacks is extremely noticeable, not only in Africa, but primarily White European countries &#8220;blessed&#8221; with a Black immigrant population is something locals are very much aware of. Even if the controlled media does its best to downplay Black crime.</p>

<p>That &#8220;child&rsquo;s&#8221; Mother was and still is an affirmative action Florida State Police Officer.  The predatory thug got out but was still on parole for the stomping of the 6 year old.  Last I heard a few years ago, his parole was revoked.  He called a pizza delivery and when the pizza arrived robbed the delivery man at gunpoint.  This is the classic black ghetto crime isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>By the way, affirmative action police officer Mother was at home asleep (passed out?) during the early evening when the robbery occurred.  The &#8220;child&#8221; used Mom&rsquo;s police revolver to commit the robbery.<br>

<p>That 12 year old &#8216;goot boy&rsquo; was pretty handy with a gun, wasn&rsquo;t he? Bet mama didn&rsquo;t even know he had one. Mama also had no idea where her &#8216;chall&rsquo; was, what he was doing. Why? Because she didn&rsquo;t care. He was only a monthly welfare payment to her. White AND black people are dying every day because black parents don&rsquo;t give a flying fig.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this boy is 12 years old. At 6 foot 2 inches, it is almost impossible.</p>
<p>What I believe is that he is still in the 6th or 7th grade, and that is why the mainstream reporters are stating that he is 12 years old. I was eleven when I was in the 6th grade, but I was a year younger than the other students. This &#8220;boy&#8221; was probably held back several grades, is mostly likely 16 or 17.</p>

<p>A second woman in two weeks was raped in Philadelphia&rsquo;s Fairmount Park two nights ago.( That&rsquo;s not counting the two or three nightly shootings) The MO was the same in each case. Channel 6 Action News described the suspect as a man wearing a blue jacket or something like that. They&rsquo;re asking for help from anyone who might remember having seen that man.  Based on the info. given, I&rsquo;m certain that they&rsquo;ll be inundated with useful tips.<br>
White women, they&rsquo;re after you. Buy a good (snub nose) revolver and learn how to use it!!!!!!! Better to be judged by twelve than to be carried by six. And stop jogging at night in parks. If you can&rsquo;t jog during the day buy yourself a treadmill. If you can jog during the day make sure that you bring that revolver! THis is not the same society in which your grandmother grew up.</p>

<p>Could it be some kind of strategic lie by his lawyer<br>
to get the case sent down to juvenile court instead of <br>
adult court? That might be the only hope of avoiding the <br>

		<p>I wonder if there has been any increase in black on White rape since Obama was elected?</p>
<p>My neighborhood watch occasionally posts notices about crime in the area.  Last summer there was a rash of home invasions during the day.  Elderly women were targetted.  Most were widows living alone which made me suspect that the homes were carefully selected long before the robberies.</p>
<p>The invasions always occurred during the day.  The victims would return home alone, walk up to the door and be grabbed and rushed into the house.  No one was hurt as far as I know, although that would have been covered up.</p>
<p>But the posters were ridiculous.  Absolutely no description of the criminals.  I walked right into a news van and one of the newscasters making a report.  The police were still there.  The newscaster, another White male traitor asked me my opinion of the home invasions.  I in turn asked him to describe the invaders.  He totally refused to tell me the race or give any description of the invaders.</p>
<p>How the neighborhood watch thought those posters would help potential victims without a description of the home invaders I do not know.</p>

<p>Well, I agree. It shouldn&rsquo;t just be the parent raising the kid but the absentee one as well, usually the father. As a matter of fact, the absentee parent is more responsible. Also, some kids do rebel so I don&rsquo;t agree with charging the parent with the crime, but if the parent is negligent in their duties, then they should be charged with child negligence instead.<br>

<p>I never said that she deserved to die. And what do you mean &#8220;she was a stripper, so what&#8221;? You would feel the same sorrow for someone else who was innocently caught-up in this murderous robbery attempt? She came from a 99% white small town to crack-infested Detroit to ply her dangerous trade. Many strippers (especially beautiful ones) are also prostitutes. Plain and simple, she put herself in harms way. . I feel sorry for her father, family and friends. It&rsquo;s tough for me to feel sorry for her.</p>

		<p>To Alexandra:</p>
<p>Eastpointe, MI was East Detroit, but they changed the name to Eastpointe, because the town fathers thought that &#8220;East&#8221; Detroit had too many stigmata attached to it, because of Detroit&rsquo;s rep. They thought the name sounded sleazy, so they changed it to &#8220;Eastpointe&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lake Station, IN - the same story for the same reason. Lake Station was formerly known as East Gary.</p>

		<p>This case is similar to the Michigan &#8220;nathaniel abraham&#8221; case.  After murdering a man in cold blood at 13, this &#8220;youngster&#8221; (predator) was given a &#8220;blended sentence&#8221; by a &#8220;bleeding heart&#8221; judge.  Despite problems and &#8220;acting out&#8221; in the juvenile system, he was released.  The state attempted to give him a &#8220;free college education&#8221; and set him up in his own apartment.  However, when word got out, the public outcry was so great that the state was forced to back down.<br>
nathaniel abraham is now serving an &#8220;adult sentence&#8221; for robbing a pizza delivery man.<br>
