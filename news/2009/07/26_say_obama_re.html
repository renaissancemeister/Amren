			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen Reports, July 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Twenty-six percent (26%) of voters nationwide say President Obama did a good or excellent job answering a press conference question about an incident involving a white Cambridge, Massachusetts policeman and a black Harvard professor. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 46% rate the president&rsquo;s response as poor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The president was asked about the arrest of a prominent African-America professor at Harvard and the professor&rsquo;s subsequent complaint of racial profiling. While admitting he did not know all the details and acknowledging that the professor was a personal friend, the president said the police acted &#8220;stupidly&#8221; when they arrested Henry Louis Gates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seventy-one percent (71%) of African-Americans say the president&rsquo;s response was good or excellent, a view shared by just 22% of white Americans.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, 53% of white voters gave the president&rsquo;s response a poor grade. Only five percent (5%) of black Americans offered such a negative response.</p>
<p>African-Americans, by a two-to-one margin, say the question was inappropriate. Whites are fairly evenly divided on the appropriateness of the question.</p>
<p>Seventy-three percent (73%) of African-American voters believe that most blacks receive unfair treatment from the police. Just 21% of white voters share that view.</p>
<p>Thirty-two percent (32%) of black voters say that most policemen are racist, but 52% disagree.</p>
<p>Among white voters, just seven percent (7%) believe that most policemen are racist and 71% say they are not.</p>
<p>On a partisan basis, 50% of Democrats say the president&rsquo;s response was good or excellent. White Democrats are less supportive than black Democrats. The president&rsquo;s response earned a poor rating from 77% of Republicans and 52% of those not affiliated with either major party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The survey was conducted on Friday and Saturday, following significant efforts by the White House to move beyond this issue. The president called both the police officer and the professor with the suggestion that the three of them share a beer at the White House.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Following the press conference, the president&rsquo;s job approval ratings fell to new lows. {snip}</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s just split the difference and say most policemen are race realists. To toe the black-favored line police officers would have to be legally blind. Perhaps that is what they&rsquo;d like police officers to be. As long as they know most blacks (53% in our wonderful mosaic of diversity) commit their crimes against whites. &#8220;Seventy-three percent (73%) of African-American voters believe that most blacks receive unfair treatment from the police.&#8221; That&rsquo;s insane, and fits the definition of legal insanity. Most cops would rather deal with offenders who&rsquo;s race is anything but black. </p>

		<p>Those of us who have been paying attention know that this president is a racist whose friends are terrorists and communists, as well as thugs. </p>
<p>Please do not become distracted by this  &mdash;  keep the heat on your reps regarding his hideous health plan, etc. Summer recess is the time to find your local congresscritter&rsquo;s &#8220;town hall&#8221; meeting schedule, get to a meeting and make your views heard.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with 2/3 of Blacks that the question put to BHO was inappropriate.  And, because it was inappropriate, he could have dodged it easily, if he was smarter. &#8220;No comment.  That&rsquo;s a local matter.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>There are only two things one should ever say to an officer and they are &#8220;Yes sir&#8221; and &#8220;No sir&#8221;. This demonstrates a major disconnect in those who fail to realize that running one&rsquo;s mouth at an officer is inappropriate. There is a proper time and place to deal with complaints and the street isn&rsquo;t it. Unfortunately, even Harvard professors and US Presidents don&rsquo;t seem to understand that.</p>

		<p>One thing is for certain.  Whites are reaching the boiling point.</p>
<p>There is a lot of anger by whites expressed on many chat boards.<br>
I think this backfired on Gates and Obama.  Even liberals are starting to get the picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;As always, whitey now sits in judgment of me, preparing to cast my fate. It is your decision either to let me blow with the wind as a nonentity or to encourage the development of self. Allow me to prove myself.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Though this matter seems to be ending happily, I hope the lesson has been learned: Blacks, regardless of their education level or their status in society  &mdash;  even the President of the United States  &mdash;  will prejudge EVERY situation along racial lines. Even the nation&rsquo;s preeminent &#8220;black studies&#8221; professor is a ticking time bomb, ready to explode in infantile behavior and false accusations of racism at the smallest provocation.</p>
<p>Sergeant Crowley is more of a man than Obama and that affirmative action hire put together. He&rsquo;ll have the good sense not to rub it in when they sit down for a beer, but we all know the score.</p>

<p>Oh what a pity that is!</p>
<p>Comrade General Secretary BO was an abject fool (the King of Fools, to be precise) for allowing his vile media whores to &ldquo;steal his wallet,&rdquo; while he slumbered next to them on this one. The filthy Red harlots, will not let this one go and now they have managed to drag their demagogic tricky-pimp into the fray. They seem to think that this will &ldquo;stimulate&rdquo; a &ldquo;much needed&rdquo; conversation about race and of course &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; in this country. </p>
<p>Never mind Akron or Knoxville, among other similarly &ldquo;non-racially&rdquo; motivated incidents, this is what will be our national aria on race. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s just another black anti-white hater in a long list of white haters that are friends with the messiah.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written on here many times that this pro-black, anti-white president can&rsquo;t possibly hold anything but a quiet, hateful animosity towards whites, considering what he blurts out from time to time, his picks for office, and his close relationships with nearly every anti-white black activist in the country.  It was obvious to me from the beginning.</p>
<p>Also, obvious was the fact that his 20 years of black activism, as a black community organizer, verified his anti-white, pro-black agenda, and the presidency was just a way to attain his agenda under the guise of bringing unity between blacks and whites.  Rather than creating unity, he has upset many in the white population and encouraged black arrogance and attitude.</p>
<p>Keith Albo, a forensic psychiatrist was on Glenn Beck this evening.  Glenn asked him what he thought of Obama&rsquo;s conduct regarding the Gates matter.  Dr. Albo spelled it right out.  It was a shocker in that I never thought anyone would have the nerve to say what I&rsquo;ve believed all along.</p>
<p>It was his opinion that Obama had finally provided enough information in order for a trained person as he is to determine where he&rsquo;s (Obama) coming from, and Dr. Albo further noted that Obama dislikes whites.  He said his anger shows in a number of ways:  1)The company he keeps, and kept before becoming president, ie, Jeremiah Wright, Henry Gates, and a substantial number of other black malcontents who regard white people with disdain and dislike.</p>
<p>He said, further, that the messiah&rsquo;s pick to the supreme court of a woman who obviously dislike whites reveals this animosity by Obama.  He listed several other things as well.  His conclusion was that, before now, we had our suspicions, but now we have enough evidence to form a conclusion and that conclusion is that Obama is anti-white and will promote any person or agenda that agrees with him.  </p>
<p>He hides his animosity well, but it IS there for anyone who has the perception to see it, and it IS flourishing greatly.  Right now all we&rsquo;re going to be able to do is get snippets of information revealing his animosity, as we have been doing all along.</p>
<p>If anybody can watch this first segment of Glenn Beck when it comes up on youtube&hellip;.and it will&hellip;..it&rsquo;s explosive&hellip;&hellip;do so.  I strongly urge you to hear a man put to words what most of us have been thinking.</p>
<p>I think, also, there&rsquo;s a very real possibility that the woman who asked Obama about Gates&rsquo; arrest was told to do so by the White House, because there&rsquo;s no way she could have known so early that Obama was aware of the incident.  It would be Obama&rsquo;s sneaky, deceitful way of condemning the myth of racial profiling, hoping to bring pressure to bear on all police to treat all blacks with extreme deference.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be in for a harder time than I first expected.  </p>

		<p>Obama shows his well-hidden, at first, lack of intelligence, more and more. Look at his vagueness and lack of knowledge about HealthCare, Afghanistan, the alleged CO2 &#8220;crisis&#8221;, economics, and now the Cambridge police.</p>
<p>I love how not only do blacks like his &#8220;stupid&#8221; answer about the police, but that most blacks think &#8220;the question [about the officers&rsquo; treatment of Gates] was inappropriate. </p>
<p>Blacks have no concept of a full, two-sided debate. Only one side: theirs. This is the hallmark of unintelligent people who lack true intellectual curiosity. Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;white side&#8221; fades more each day.  </p>

		<p>  In an interview on C-SPAN with Brian Lamb, Gates talked about how his mother hated white people and loved Malcolm X.  Oh, and that his wife is&hellip; white!  Not surprising when you think about it.  Here are the links to the transcript:</p>

<p>AMB: At one point you had a line in there, something to the effect, &#8220;My mother despised white people.&#8221; </p>
<p>GATES: My mother hated white people. </p>
<p>LAMB: All her life? </p>
<p>GATES: Probably. I didn&rsquo;t know until   &mdash;   in 1959 we were watching Mike Wallace&rsquo;s documentary called &#8220;The Hate that Hate Produced.&#8221; It was about the Nation of Islam and I couldn&rsquo;t believe   &mdash;   I mean, Malcolm X was talking about the white man was the devil and standing up in white people&rsquo;s faces and telling them off. It was great. </p>
<p>(&hellip;)</p>
<p>LAMB: And is your wife white? </p>
<p>GATES: Yeah. She&rsquo;s white. <br>

		<p>Every time that I had to call police because of a problem that I had(being robbed at gunpoint by Black kids, having my windows smashed in), the policemen were very upfront to me about their contempt for Blacks. They didn&rsquo;t even seem to have any fear of backlash from presenting their views so openly to me. I usually am very careful about what I say, but I guess after dealing with the miscreants of society day in and day out, they get to a point where they just don&rsquo;t give a damn anymore. Who can blame them for this? Oh that&rsquo;s right. Black people and liberals.</p>

		<p>I work in a small grocery store in the south, and about half of our customers are black.  I have only worked there for a few months, but it&rsquo;s completely obvious that blacks simply do not listen to anything you say.  If a white person asks where an item is located, and I reply &#8220;on aisle five, sir,&#8221; nine times out of ten they will say &#8220;thank you&#8221; and go on their way.  If a black asks the same question and I respond the same way, I hear &#8220;what?  what you say?&#8221;  Nine times out of ten, they were on they cell phone when they axed the question, and when you answer the question, they are babbling on it again.  I normally have to tell them three or four times where something is.  I don&rsquo;t know if they simply ignore what&rsquo;s being said, or if it&rsquo;s a form of hostility  &mdash;  sticking it to &#8220;the man.&#8221;  I imagine, however, that Gates is not different.  He probably had no idea that Crowley was asking for identification  &mdash;  what he probably heard coming from Crowley was &#8220;you&rsquo;re a black man in America, and I am arresting you in your own home, and there is nothing you can do about it.  I and every other white person in American would certainly recognize the redoubtable Dr. Gates, yet as a racist cop I will choose to pretend that you are not Dr. Gates, but a loudmouthed boor.&#8221;  In Gate&rsquo;s mind, his own response was probably akin to &#8220;may I invite you into my home for a cup of tea, good sir officer?&#8221;  Of course he was shocked at Crowley&rsquo;s response.</p>

		<p>I hope that what Obama sees as a &#8220;teaching moment&#8221; turns out to be a lesson for him. Maybe the police officer should bring a tape of the incident with him and let Prof. Gates and the President hear exactly what happend. But, strangely enough, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t matter. The &#8220;racist&#8221; label is so deeply engrained in blacks, they can&rsquo;t see the truth for the color.</p>

		<p>Of course, the majority of blacks are going to side with Obama even though he&rsquo;s a Mulatto and <i>not a slave descendant</i>, just as they did with O J S.</p>
<p>Why is this so?  </p>
<p>Because blacks are obviously far far more inherently racist and hate-filled against whites than whites are against them.</p>
<p>I wonder, if blacks habor as great a deep-seated racial hatred for Jews and Arabs! After all, both of these played a much larger and in the case of the Arabs, longer role in the slavery racket than whites ever did.</p>

		<p>The American Spectator<br>
July 24, 2009<br>
By Ben Stein </p>
<p><i>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve Figured Him Out.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Why is President Barack Obama in such a hurry to get his socialized medicine bill passed?&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Because he and his cunning circle realize some basic truths:</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;The American people in their unimaginable kindness and trust voted for a pig in a poke in 2008. They wanted so much to believe Barack Obama was somehow better and different from other ultra-leftists that they simply took him on faith.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;They ignored his anti-white writings in his books. They ignored his quiet acceptance of hysterical anti-American diatribes by his minister, Jeremiah Wright.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>They ignored his refusal to explain years at a time of his life as a student. They ignored his ultra-left record as a &#8220;community organizer,&#8221; Illinois state legislator, and Senator.</p>
<p>The American people ignored his total zero of an academic record as a student and teacher, his complete lack of scholarship when he was being touted as a scholar.</p>
<p>Now, the American people are starting to wake up to the truth. Barack Obama is a super likeable super leftist, not a fan of this country, way, way too cozy with the terrorist leaders in the Middle East, way beyond naïveté, all the way into active destruction of our interests and our allies and our future.</p>
<p>The American people have already awakened to the truth that the stimulus bill   &mdash;   a great idea in theory   &mdash;   was really an immense bribe to Democrat interest groups, and in no way an effort to help all Americans.</p>
<p>Now, Americans are waking up to the truth that ObamaCare basically means that every time you are sick or injured, you will have a clerk from the Department of Motor Vehicles telling your doctor what he can and cannot do.</p>
<p>The American people already know that Mr. Obama&rsquo;s plan to lower health costs while expanding coverage and bureaucracy is a myth, a promise of something that never was and never will be   &mdash;   a bureaucracy lowering costs in a free society. Either the costs go up or the free society goes away.</p>
<p>These are perilous times. Mrs. Hillary Clinton, our Secretary of State, has given Iran the go-ahead to have nuclear weapons, an unqualified betrayal of the nation. Now, we face a devastating loss of freedom at home in health care. It will be joined by controls on our lives to &#8220;protect us&#8221; from global warming, itself largely a fraud if believed to be caused by man.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama knows Americans are getting wise and will stop him if he delays at all in taking away our freedoms.</p>
<p>There is his urgency and our opportunity. Once freedom is lost, America is lost. Wake up, beloved America.</p>

		<p>Obama is remarkably immature.  That whole &#8220;settle differences over a beer&#8221; thing is something I saw over and over in college.  It&rsquo;s great for minor disputes between dormmates, but the fact that Obama is endorsing the beer summit shows just how devoid of ideas he really is.</p>

		<p>#6 Anonymous says, &#8220;even liberals are starting to get the picture.&#8221; I don&rsquo;t know. It will take a hell of a lot more than a few incidents of so -called reverse racism to make me believe that &#8220;liberals are starting to get the picture&#8221;. That would mean a reappraisal of their whole philosophy and I just cant&rsquo; imagine it at this point in time.</p>

		<p>This whole &#8220;beer at the White House&#8221; thing is a potential powder keg&hellip;I&rsquo;ve seen Gates on PBS a time or two and can honestly say he&rsquo;s openly hostile towards everything White&hellip;I mean, he was complaining about how Whites were being served food and drinks by Blacks on a beach in Africa&hellip;It didn&rsquo;t matter that they were probably the largest contributor to the local economy, he felt that it should&rsquo;ve been the other way around irregardless&hellip;This is the mentality that we&rsquo;re dealing with here, folks&hellip;Couple that with the first White man I can remember in modern history who flat out refused to cave in and apologize at the behest of a Black and we have a recipe for fireworks&hellip;Obama&rsquo;s grand plan of damage control may backfire right before his eyes should officer Crowley elect to once again demonstrate his previous fortitude&hellip;It&rsquo;s a given that Gates will take a jab at him for a myriad of reasons&hellip;First of all, his pride is hurt and he needs to save face&hellip;Secondly, as mentioned before, he&rsquo;s far too hostile to let a White man have any semblance of moral authority over him&hellip;.Thirdly, this is what he does for a living&hellip;He can&rsquo;t be wrong, even when he IS wrong&hellip;It&rsquo;s just not good for the cause&hellip;.He worked too long and hard to create this spectre of victimhood to be anything other than just that&hellip;A victim of White aggression&hellip;.These are just the more obvious reasons, God only knows what else is running through his arrogant mind&hellip;I&rsquo;m just hoping they televise it&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Never mind Akron or Knoxville, among other similarly &ldquo;non-racially&rdquo; motivated incidents, this is what will be our national aria on race. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>And never mind Wichita, Little Rock (Anne Pressley) and the thousands of other places in which Civil War II is being fought, by one side only of course. The other side (Whites)haven&rsquo;t caught on as yet.<br>
It will be as are all other &#8220;discussions&#8221; on race. The white(s) will sit obediently and listen as a diatribe is lowered on them about how evil White people have been, are and will be per omnia saecula saeculorum.<br>
John, with all due respect to you and God. God helps those who help themselves.</p>

		<p>This is to Reaper:</p>
<p>Why, I think that would be great! I mean, if Gates really lost his temper on television. Many white people might realize the kind of reverse racist he is (and the same kind of individual that Barack is).</p>
