<h1>Famous Swedish Writer Connected to Racial Biology</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mats Öhlén, Stockhom News, July 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The classic Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf had connections with the ideology of racial biology according to a new article that has stirred up a debate.</p>
<p>In the last years several famous Swedes, for example Ingemar Bergman and Ingvar Kamprad, have admitted that they had leanings towards racial biologist ideology in their youth.</p>
<p>This is rather sensitive in the today&rsquo;s media-Sweden with a self-image of a liberal and tolerant country. Now another celebrity, Selma Lagerlöf is accused of leanings towards race biology in her youth.</p>
<p>It is an article by Bosse Schön published at the online debate site Newsmill.se that has stirred up emotions. He writes that although Selma Lagerlöf did reject antisemitism (she helped the German-Jewish writer Nelly Sachs to escape to Sweden) she supported a racial biologist ideology.</p>
<p>Bosse Schön bases his &#8216;accusation&rsquo; on a beauty contest in Stockholm arranged by the Swedish Race Biological Institute in 1921. This was a special kind of beauty contest in which the competitors were judged by their racial purity. Selma Lagerlöf is supposed to have donated a book and her autograph to the prices.</p>
<p>We must nevertheless remember that this was common sense in Sweden during the 1920´s. Sweden was in the front in the world when it comes to racial conciousness and it had since 1922 a public institute for guarding the &#8216;purity&rsquo; and &#8216;health&rsquo; of the Swedish people.</p>
<p>Selma Lagerlöf (1858-1940) is one of Sweden&rsquo;s most beloved writers. Her books are most famous for their romantic and sentimental style. The most famous is &#8216;Nils Holgerssons underbara resa genom Sverige&rsquo; (Eng. The Wonderful Adventures of Nils). She won the Nobel price in literature in 1909.<br>

<p>There must be no common sense in Sweden today.  And the Swedes don&rsquo;t care if they are replaced by Africans.  I mean, humans are no different than Lego&rsquo;s - different colors but interchangable.</p>
<p>Sweden is os weird and Socialist that they don&rsquo;t even let the King wear his crown..it always sits on a chair next to him.</p>

<p>Liberalism and a tolerant country have nothing to do with scientific fact, and to politicize eugenics is a mighty dangerous endeavor, one which will prove disasterous in the next 3 years.</p>
<p>The flakes, oddballs, kooks will be very disappointed in what the Wesy is going to look like soon.  Even more disturbing will be how attitudes have changed that are in oposition to their own.</p>
<p>Maybe they could live abroad in Africa, if they can get away, one step ahead of their pursuers.</p>

		<p>I have news for them - biology is racist! That is, of course, by the well accepted definition that &#8220;racism&#8221; simply means recognizing cognitive, physical and psychological differences between groups of people. </p>
<p>Up until the PC era of the last several decades, it was considered a given that racial and ethnic solidarity helped to keep a society or country strong; miscegenation and marrying outside of one&rsquo;s religion bred contempt, distrust and resentment. </p>

		<p>In those days, Sweden was racialist and welfarist.  And Germany was equally racialist and welfarist.</p>
<p>Funny how all you ever heard about was one country&rsquo;s welfarism and the other country&rsquo;s racialism.</p>
<p>The main difference was that Sweden was small and neutral, and kept her troops at home, where they belong.</p>

		<p>Funny. It&rsquo;s all right for blacks to have &#8220;black pride&#8221;. But Swedes? Perish the thought. Well, look at all the technology and contributions to science Kenya and Ghana have made compared with Sweden. What&rsquo;s Sweden got to be proud of?</p>

		<p>I used to have a sig/o that was-and I guess still is-a complete nut when it came to racial reality. This was a woman who worked with blacks,complained about blacks for 2 hours a night,and still wouldn&rsquo;t admit that the differences just might,maybe,be based in biology instead of culture.</p>
<p>She pointed out once that &#8220;We all bleed red!&#8221;</p>
<p>I pointed out right back at her that she had a tomcat that bled red when he got clawed up in a fight.</p>
<p>And then I asked her if that made the tomcat her equal.</p>
<p>It was-I believe-the only time I ever get her to be quiet.</p>

		<p>Swedes are tolerant? It depends. When Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics, they actually banned all boxing events in Stockholm, saying the Swedes were a peace-loving people and boxing was too violent.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sound like being tolerant to me.</p>

		<p>1 Shrewsbury, I understand that at least one Nobel Peace Prize Laureate was a race realist: Dr Albert Schweitzer, who spent his life healing the sick in Africa.  He knew what he was talking about after 50 years among Blacks.  </p>

		<p>There are surprising number of Nobel Prize winners who have said things in support of racial differences. And I suspect there are a whole lot more who agree but just don&rsquo;t say anything. It&rsquo;s the rest of the people who don&rsquo;t have common sense.</p>

		<p>Nothing much going on in Sweden at the moment if this is newsworthy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bosse Schön bases his &lsquo;accusation&rsquo; on a beauty contest in Stockholm arranged by the Swedish Race Biological Institute in 1921. This was a special kind of beauty contest in which the competitors were judged by their racial purity. Selma Lagerlöf is supposed to have donated a book and her autograph to the prices.&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;that would be &#8216;prizes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All right then, she donated (or is supposed to have donated) a book to a beauty contest based on racial purity waaaaay back in 1912. So what&rsquo;s next? Public burnings of one of Sweden&rsquo;s most beloved writers?<br>
This Bosse Schon needs a hobby.</p>

&#8220;Assusation&#8221;   &mdash;    Yes,  I noticed that eye-catching word too.   A  revealing choice of slanted terminology.  Talk about biased journalism!   &#8220;Bossy&#8221; Schön couldn&rsquo;t manage to get &#8220;prizes&#8221; correct, but was more particular about applying  the word &#8220;accused&#8221;.  [Btw, is Schön a Swedish name?  Looks to me like an import from Germany.] </p>
<p>We are &#8220;blamed&#8221; for  our mistakes, but &#8220;accused&#8221;  of deliberate and willful crimes&hellip;  or, or at least, of  something quite horrible, evil, and outrageous    &mdash;   if not fully illegal.  For merely an innocent mistake, one only gets blamed, not accused.  </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Far from alone indeed! </p>
<p>One of those names could  (almost) be the French writer, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, &#8220;considered one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century&#8221;.  However, he also wrote pamphlets for the French Right, which have compromised his reputation and have made him &#8220;controversial&#8221; to this day.  I say &#8220;almost&#8221; because he did not win the Nobel Prize, nor the Prix Goncourt, which he would have otherwise, but he was bypassed as being too controversial.</p>
<p>Surely one of those  ostracized Nobel winners who were on the &#8220;wrong&#8221; ideological side would be the great Norwegian writer, Knut Hamsun, once universally acclaimed but now almost forgotten and reduced to virtually a non-person, as the result of his pro-German sympathies. Those sympathies began with the Boer War, extended into the 1st WW and then the 2nd.  As a result, he was virtually crucified in his own country after WW2,  was put on trial (for his opinions) at the advanced age of 90, and escaped the death penalty only on account of his age. The government found an &#8220;excuse&#8221; to avoid killing him by declaring him mentally incompetent.  (Same as Ezra Pound.)   Nonetheless, he was heavily fined and was reduced to  poverty for the remainder of his life.</p>
<p>Hamsun has been called &#8220;the father of modern literature.&#8221;  The author  Isaac Bashevis Singer  wrote in 1967, &ldquo;The whole school of fiction in the 20th century stems from Hamsun&#8221;.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/books/28hams.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/books/28hams.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Following the end of the war, angry crowds burned his books in public in major Norwegian cities. Hamsun was confined &hellip; in a psychiatric hospital [where] a psychiatrist concluded he had &#8220;permanently impaired mental abilities&#8221;, &hellip;on that basis the charges of treason were dropped.  Instead, a civil liability case was brought against him, and in 1948 he was fined 325,000 kroner for his alleged membership in Nasjonal Samling &hellip;.  [however], Hamsun stated that he was never a member of any political party.&#8221;  [Wikipedia]</p>
<p> &#8220;After the war Hamsun was held in custody for some time – his wife [Marie] was imprisoned and sentenced to three years hard labor. In 1945 Hamsun was transferred to a psychiatric clinic in Oslo. Marie was interrogated [on] intimate details about their marriage and sexual life. In 1947 Hamsun <b><i> was tried and fined for his opinions.  </i></b>Ignoring the advice of counsel, he refused to pretend that he was senile &hellip;&#8221;<br>
http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/khamsun.htm</p>
<p> After the war he was sentenced to the loss of his property, put under psychiatric observation, his marriage was destroyed, and he spent his last years in poverty.&#8221;<br>
