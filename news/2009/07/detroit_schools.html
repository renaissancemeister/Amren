<h1><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124813472753066949.html">Detroit Schools on the Brink</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex P. Kellogg, AP, July 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A decision on whether to file for protection under federal bankruptcy laws will be made by the end of summer, according to Robert Bobb, Detroit Public Schools&rsquo; emergency financial manager. Such a filing would be unprecedented in the U.S. Although a few major urban school districts have come close, none has gone through with a bankruptcy, according to legal and education experts.</p>
<p>But in Detroit  &mdash;  where U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan dubbed the school system a &#8220;national disgrace&#8221; this spring  &mdash;  lawmakers and bankruptcy experts see few alternatives, given the deep financial challenges confronting the district and the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I optimistic that they can avoid it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? I am not,&#8221; says Ray Graves, a retired bankruptcy judge who has been advising Mr. Bobb in recent weeks.</p>
<p>As with General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC, bankruptcy may not be the worst thing for Detroit&rsquo;s schools. A filing under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, which covers public entities like school districts and municipalities, would allow the district to put major creditors such as textbook publishers, private bus operators and DTE Energy, the local gas-and-electric utility, in line for payment. It also would give Mr. Bobb broad latitude to tear up union contracts without protracted negotiations.</p>
<p>But a filing also could hurt the district&rsquo;s debt rating and ability to float bonds.</p>
<p>Some experts say the Detroit case could be the first in a string of Chapter 9 bankruptcies among school districts and other public entities battered by the economic crisis, and it could help shape that area of the law. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Behind DPS&rsquo;s predicament are many of the same problems that have haunted the city&rsquo;s auto industry for years: excess capacity, high labor and pension costs, fleeing customers, ineffective management, outside competition and  &mdash;  except for a handful of respected programs  &mdash;  a reputation for low quality.</p>
<p>Even after millions of dollars in budget cuts in the spring, including 29 school closings and thousands of layoffs, the district started the fiscal year this month with a $259 million deficit. To meet payroll and pension obligations, the district has had to seek advances on state funding and other stopgap measures.</p>
<p>DPS&rsquo;s enrollment  &mdash;  which largely determines its allotment of state funding  &mdash;  is about half what it was in 2001, as suburban districts and charter schools have siphoned off tens of thousands of students. By this fall, DPS will have 172 schools open and more than 100 vacant. Meanwhile, the high-school-graduation rate is 58%; coupled with the enrollment losses, only about one-quarter of students who start high school in the district graduate from it in four years, according to outside estimates.</p>
<p>But DPS&rsquo;s problems go beyond the type that sank GM and Chrysler. Wide-scale corruption has depleted district coffers, which held a $103.6 million surplus as recently as 2002. In June, Mr. Bobb&rsquo;s new team of forensic accountants found DPS paychecks going to 257 &#8220;ghost&#8221; employees who have yet to be accounted for. A separate Federal Bureau of Investigation probe in May led to the indictment of a former payroll manager and another former employee on charges of bilking the district out of about $400,000 over four years.</p>

		<p>&#8220;DPS paychecks going to 257 &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; employees who have yet to be accounted for&#8221;</p>
<p>My wife used to work for a large state agency.  Every so often, without warning, auditors would show up on payday.  Everyone had to present idea and sign for their paychecks in front of the auditors.  The auditors did not work in that office and thus had no reason to fake anything.  If you were not in the office on audit payday you didn&rsquo;t get your check until you came to work and verified why you were out (sick, vacation day, etc.).  That office never had a ghost employee the whole time my spouse worked there.</p>

Time and time and time again, blacks demand they be given control of &#8216;their&rsquo; schools. Black teachers, black principals, black school boards, black administrators, black-centered lessons, etc. The results are always the same.</p>
<p>The big push is now to get black kids into the better schools found in the suburbs. Just more of black clamoring for their &#8216;right&rsquo; to get away from the problems they create.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how location (not demographics) is seen as the problem. <br>

		<p>I know Chapter 9 is different, but when you think of bankruptcy, you usually think of liquidation.  That said, let me pose a question:  If you&rsquo;re a creditor of the DPS, who would want any of their assets?</p>

		<p>Since affirmative action in college admissions began in the latter 1960&rsquo;s, taxpayers (read:white taxpayers)have paid for college educations for uncounted thousands of blacks, most of whom have degrees in education, (because education is known for its &#8220;cake&#8221; courses. As of a few years ago, anyway, the U.S.had not graduated one black doctor of computer sciences.)Nevertheless, how about some of those blacks offering to give something back to the community? They could fill in at school, and tutor kids after school. That 58% graduation rate is misleading, because most of the graduates can&rsquo;t read or do math on a high school level. Tutors could bring up the level of black education. Why haven&rsquo;t we heard of blacks making such programs?</p>

		<p>I live in an almost all white suburb of Memphis, TN called Germantown and our high school (and middle school) is now majority black. It was once noted as one of the best schools in the state, but not anymore. The good schools used to help the property values here, but now the schools aren&rsquo;t a good selling point for our houses. Most of my neighbors either home school or send there kids to private schools that they can barely afford. We call it the &#8220;white tax&#8221;.<br>
Since we&rsquo;re part of the county school system, blacks are bussed in from the southeast part of the county (which is outside our city limits) to go to school in the white,(at least used to be white)suburban school.<br>
They even built a brand new school for the county students, but they complained that the only reason it was built was to keep blacks out of the traditionally white suburban school. They were given the best of everything, yet they still wanted what is ours. They filled the new school to capacity, but we still have a bunch bussed in here and there are more every year. <br>
I won&rsquo;t be surprised when our schools and neighborhoods end up like Detroit&rsquo;s.   </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that tutoring programs exist, but they likely aren&rsquo;t reported on because they too are doing poorly. </p>

		<p>I secretly live for stories about what Detroit is.  And they never disappoint.  </p>
<p>If you GIS &#8220;A tree grows in Detroit&#8221; you&rsquo;ll find an image of a tree growing <i>inside a school book depository</i>.  Those piles of math and science books have been mouldering in there so long that they&rsquo;ve become nourishment for a stray seed that sprouted into a tree.  It&rsquo;s the only use those books have had in Detroit in two generations. </p>

		<p>Eric Clemens: I traveled through Germantown in about 1998. I remember it was the crown jewel of Tennessee. The saying among blacks was the &#8220;no white folks live in Memphis- they live in Germantown or West Memphis.&#8221; Where are people moving- Collierville?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think this bankruptcy is so likely as the Obama/con-grease &#8220;stimulus&#8221; is rewarding Detroit schools with  530 million; http://tinyurl.com/ko5q6k</p>
<p>Actually, you and I are to blame for this continuing waste as we never take the minimal effort of at least complaining to our politicians.</p>
