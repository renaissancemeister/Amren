<h1>Confederate Flag Nixes ACC Baseball Tourney in South Carolina</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Strelow, The State (Columbia, South Carolina), July 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The ACC won&rsquo;t be holding the conference baseball tournament in Myrtle Beach, Commissioner John Swofford said today.</p>
<p>The ACC Baseball Championship will be held at NewBridge Bank Park in Greensboro, N.C. (2012), and the Durham Bulls Athletic Park (2011, 2013). This will give the championship a home through 2013, as the 2010 ACC Baseball Championship will be held in Greensboro, N.C.</p>
<p>The 2011-13 championships were originally awarded to Myrtle Beach. The ACC&rsquo;s decision to hold the tournament in this location was made with the stipulation that discussions be held, and agreements made, with all local and state organizations that had voiced concerns over the Confederate flag being flown on the state grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lonnie Randolph, state president of the NAACP, declined comment other than to say, &#8220;We have been having some very productive and friendly conversations with the ACC regarding the matter.&#8221;<br>

		<p>South Carolina showed fear in front of the NAACP dogs in 2000, by moving The Flag that was flying atop the State House dome down to a memorial.  The NAACP is still mad, and this has resonated to the Atlantic Coast Conference not holding anymore conference baseball tournaments in South Carolina.  For the record, the only ACC school in SC is Clemson.  (Fine, as far as it goes, but if the ACC was going to move anything out of SC, it should have been blacksketball.)</p>
<p>The legislators in SC, plus the pseudo-conservative groups, that agreed to and engineered this compromise, thought they were being so clever, and thought the NAACP would stop whining.  Instead, the NAACP got more shrill and hateful.  That&rsquo;s what happens when you show fear in front of the dog.  Now, back in the late 1990s and in 2000, had you stared down the dog and beaten down the dog, and told the NAACP to go away every time they tried, they wouldn&rsquo;t be complaining today.  Look what happened in Mississippi in April 2001:  Ninety percent of white voters and twenty percent of black voters told the NAACP to go away, and that they did.  Notice you don&rsquo;t hear the NAACP growling at MS much anymore, and certainly nowhere near the level they growl at SC.</p>

		<p>It is also my opinion as I forgot to mention, that any organization such as the (ADL, JDL, AIPAC, NAACP, etc) who are able in strength and or by single person, to come to another organization, politician, government body, public body, etc, and blackmail, extort, threaten, dictate, etc; that they be arrested for &#8220;terrorism&#8221; under the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;. What these Jewish and non-white groups such as the (NAACP) are doing is illegal and against the law and the true meaning of terrorism. However, we know only us &#8220;whites&#8221; can be labeled as &#8220;terrorist&#8221; in today&rsquo;s America.</p>
<p>Terrorism is the intentional use or threat to use violence against civilians and non-combatants &#8220;in order to achieve political goals&#8221;. This tactic of political violence is intended to intimidate or cause terror for the purpose of &#8220;exerting pressure on decision making by state bodies.&#8221;The term &#8220;terror&#8221; is largely used to indicate clandestine, low-intensity violence that targets civilians and generates public fear. </p>
<p>(JDL, AIPAC, SPLC, NAACP, La Raza, WJC,etc) are all terrorist by definition!!!</p>

		<p>Every White person should fly the Confederate Battle Flag from their homes, and cars, every day. The NAACP can have a Stroke over that. </p>
<p>I fly the Confederate Flag on my property, and I am in the North. That&rsquo;s my middle finger to the NAACP and the PC bootlickers in this State. Let them tell me they don&rsquo;t like it. </p>
<p>I am outside cutting my lawn, and washing my car, and no one says boo to me, because I am not the type to be fooled with, and people know it.</p>

		<p>This is one of the many results of &#8220;The Great Society&#8221; from our friend, LBJ. The NAACP is nothing more than a strong-arm, thug, extortionist organization. It&rsquo;s time that businesses and local governments started calling them on the carpet for what they are&hellip;no further comment because &#8220;what they are&#8221; is obvious.</p>

		<p>Historically Myrtle Beach is one of the top 5 tourist destination in America with the world famous 35 mile swath of 50 story luxury hotels country music entertainment restaurant mecca Grand Strand with the cleanest widest beaches in the world.</p>
<p>Like Virginia Beach that has been taken over there is an increasing problem with the changing demograpics and massive amount of blacks and mexicans who have slowly but surely taken over driving off most white vacationers who go into far North Myrtle or far south Murrels Inlet causing a problem with crime that never had existed before. </p>

		<p>The NAACP will always have something to carry on about, no matter what concessions are made to blacks.  The more Whites give in to them, the more they&rsquo;ll want us to continue to give in.  I think South Carolina should restore the Confederate battle flag to the flag staff on the capitol dome, and leave the present flag in its current memorial setting. Make the flag as &#8220;in your face&#8221; as possible, fly one from every flagpole.  The people of South Carolina might then teach the blacks and liberals a thing or two.</p>

		<p>When does the massive boycott of blacks begin by whites? This will be one for the history books when implemented.</p>
