<h1>Police: Brick Thrown Through Window Not Hate Crime</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juana Summers, Austin American-Statesman, July 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Early Friday morning, Barbara Frische said she woke up to the sound of glass breaking inside her East Austin home.</p>
<p>She called police but didn&rsquo;t learn what had shattered the double-paned window in her 4-year-old son&rsquo;s room until after police arrived. Officers showed her a brick with a note attached: &#8220;Keep Eastside Black. Keep Eastside Strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the first time anything like this has ever happened to me,&#8221; said Frische, who is white. She has lived in her house on 13th Street for about 10 years.</p>
<p>The incident doesn&rsquo;t fall under the hate crime category, which is a classification of a charge but not a charge itself, said Austin police Sgt. Richard Stresing. He said the charge probably would be criminal mischief and deadly conduct, both misdemeanors.</p>
<p>Crimes based on race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability or gender are flagged as hate crimes, Stresing said, so they can be referred to the Department of Justice. The note attached to the brick didn&rsquo;t include hate speech, he said.</p>
<p>Frische was featured in a Statesman Watch article in May in which she lobbied for action to be taken on a charred house that neighbors said had been a gathering place for drug dealers, prostitutes and squatters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nelson Linder, president of the Austin chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said incidents such as the one that happened to Frische are rare.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Linder said this incident is linked to an undercurrent of racism that city leaders have yet to address in East Austin.</p>
<p>African American and Latino residents had been in the majority since the 1920s and &rsquo;30s  &mdash;  a trend that is starting to change. Now, some of their descendants are selling their properties to a new wave of affluent investors and would-be residents. Property taxes have doubled, tripled or more since 2000, according to Travis Central Appraisal District records.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a very sensitive time for a lot of people,&#8221; Linder said. &#8220;Certainly as African Americans we&rsquo;re under a lot of pressure, but that&rsquo;s not an excuse.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I would say this lady received some excellent advice written on this brick, advice that if she listens to it, may save her life one day. <br>
White people who deliberately stay in majority Black or Mexican areas of the country when they could live elsewhere are acting foolhardy. I suggest she listen to the brick. </p>

		<p>Well&hellip; at least they got a free brick out of it.  But yeah, no surprises here.  I wonder if Amren could have a section titled &#8220;not a hate crime&#8221; where all these types of incidents could be kept together for easy reference.  That way, we could easily link to it or refer to it in our daily debates with the ignorant classes.</p>

		<p>When I was growing in Philadelphia in the 1960s, Whites would routinely throw bricks in our and fellow Blacks homes they did not want living in thier neighborhood.</p>
<p>Most of the time, they were given a slap on the wrist by police.</p>

		<p>In 1957 a group of blacks was singing &#8220;Doo Wop&#8221; under our second floor project window in Boston around 10 p.m. My (white)father opened the window and very politely asked them to be more quiet because the family was sleeping (I witnessed this).</p>
<p>What ensued was months of rocks, bricks and doorknobs coming through all of our windows; bedrooms, living room and kitchen. One day my mother picked up my baby brother from his crib and a rock came and landed where his head had been. A brick came into my two sister&rsquo;s bedroom. After replacing one or two windows, the Boston Housing Authority decided that it was too costly and put plywood up. My mother subsequently had a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>So when an elite Black such as Henry Louis Gates Jr. explodes and accuses a white who was just doing his job (and doing it well) of being racist because &#8220;that&rsquo;s what happens to Black men in America&#8221; I just want to say, &#8220;THIS is what happens to white men in America who are minding their own business and treat blacks as equals.&#8221; Having lived in Boston for 37 years (before moving) I have many other stories.</p>
<p>Leftist Massachusetts may be waking up a bit to reality. I understand that Officer Crowley was an Obama supporter. Wonder if he will vote for him again.</p>

		<p>My grandmother lived in Gary, Indiana for far longer than she should have, and she and her family members suffered all the indignities that one would expect  &mdash;  the muggings, the burglaries, and a shooting next door. </p>
<p>One night a brick was thrown through her upstairs window  &mdash;  while she was sleeping in bed. She was afraid to do so for many nights afterwards. This despite the fact that she had helped out the blacks many times in the neighborhood, such as loaning encyclopedias to neighborhood children for schoolwork (because they didn&rsquo;t have any of their own) or loaning garden implements to their parents (which came back broken). At least the brick that went through her window didn&rsquo;t have a note attached.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Valparaiso Indiana (which is just far enough from Gary to be safe) went into an orgy of hand-wringing and conference-holding and sensitivity-training because an epithet was scrawled on a school locker (yes, a locker!) https://tinyurl.com/l2m7nq</p>

		<p>A similar thing happened to my son, who lived in a 90% Hispanic neighborhood in Houston.  After asking his neighbor nicely several times over weeks to turn down the &#8216;music&rsquo; to no avail, he finally had to call the police. Of course the &#8216;music&rsquo; resumed, even louder, after the police left.  Later he found a noose on his front door.<br>
He called the police and the black cop just shrugged and said &#8220;nothing we can do&#8221;.<br>
He carried a gun for a while after that, until he left for a nicer place to live.</p>

		<p>Lord help us if Obama and Holder get their federal hate crime law thru. They won&rsquo;t prosecute incidents caused by blacks. But any &#8220;disrespect&#8221; by whites to blacks or Latins will be a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; with the US Atty on your back. </p>

		<p>Why so many whites continue to advocate their own destruction is beyond me. In order to save ourselves, we must be uncompromising and honest. We must be forthright about our intentions. We must simply tell all who oppose us that we are fighting for our own interests and not look too kindly upon those who oppose us.</p>

		<p>I object to those Whites that feel that this woman should heed the words written on this brick. It&rsquo;s that type of appeasement and fear that is bringing White people down. I&rsquo;m ashamed to see so many White people being afraid of Blacks. Those types of Whites that run away and move out at the first sign of Black aggression are on the same level as the sycophant liberals. It&rsquo;s time that White people regain their warrior spirit and stop  cowering and hiding every time a Black person comes near. </p>

		<p>Its the same in England.</p>
<p>The authorities fall over themselves to see hate crime everywhere until, that is, it is committed against a white person. Then they will not accept it even if the evidence screams it out.</p>
<p>And our politicians wonder why no-one trusts or believes them, everyone despises the police for being so political and why we are voting BNP.</p>
<p>The worst hate crime ever in the UK, the torture, mutilation and burning alive of a young scottish lad just for being white and non-muslim was played down and pretty much forgotten about.</p>
<p>Kriss Donald - see https://theopinionator.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/02/another-muslim-race-hate-attack-on-kriss-donald-street-1.html).</p>
<p>Meanwhile every single real or imagined slight by a black person receives top billing in the news and the police fall over themselves to charge someone. Any black person taken to task for not doing their job, misbehaving or whatever instantly plays the &#8220;race card&#8221; and gets off scot free. </p>
<p>Does the govenement not see what  this is storing up in the minds of the indiginous population - the British?  </p>

		<p>A similar event occurred to my parents when they lived in San Antonio (AKA Mexico DF north.  While there was no message tied to the rocks that sailed through their front windows, the message was clear.  </p>
<p>They bought their house in the early 1960s when the cold war was at a high point and the buildup for Vietnam was beginning.  Since the neighborhood was near one of the many AF bases located around the city, a lot of white military personnel bought or rented houses in the area.   </p>
<p>But things changed rapidly as &lsquo;Nam ended and civil rights went into high gear.  The area quickly became a Hispanic barrio, filled with illegals who refused to learn English and who, of course, were drawing benefits.  My parents were made to feel unwelcome in many ways such as insults from neighbors, petty thievery and other harassment that included terroristic threats. </p>
<p>The rock incident came after several &ldquo;discussions&rdquo; with neighbors to encourage them to control their kids and keep them from constantly trespassing onto my parent&rsquo;s front and back yards.  </p>
<p>Concerning the rocks, the cops did nothing but look and mumble, and since they couldn&rsquo;t get fingerprints from stone they left.  But before they took off my dad gave them the name of one of the principle culprits in the barrio that my parents crossed many times before.   The cops ignored this and didn&rsquo;t bother to conduct an interview. </p>
<p>A few months later, the rock throwing suspect whom the cops didn&rsquo;t talk to got onto his motorcycle, sped around the corner and hit a parked car.  <br>
 <br>
When I got confirmation that he was DOA at hospital, I bought a six pack of beer and celebrated.   </p>
<p>Soon afterwards we sold the house and left. </p>

		<p>I could see this as a fake, there were a few during the campaign. The media loves them, to show that only whites are racist!</p>
<p>And, if its real?! white people and good Americans will never band together as long as there is a disconnect with who founded this country and the people that made/make up the stock of this country and the values it holds.</p>
<p>As long as we are shamed for our culture our values and our RACE! we dont stand a chance. Look at all the patriotic rallies happening around the country what majority group of people do they consist of? <br>
 The gov. sees this, they are not! foolish. Keep us divided, and they succeed and destroy exactly what I said earlier, our Country our People and most of all Our VALUES! This is beyond political party, this FOLKS is a power grab. History will repeat itself.</p>
<p>FREEDOM, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - GOD HELP US!</p>

You are far too conservative vis a vis the reaction. &#8220;El Presidente ungido por Dios&#8221; would be holding ANOTHER press conference followed by a televised town meeting hosted by him, Oprah and some carefully selected self hating Caucasians like Chris Matthews, even at the risk of a relapse of his RLS at the sight of El Magnífico, to discuss this atrocity. THEN there would be the blood lust and the hand wringing and White self-flagellation.<br>

		<p>through yahoo I found the local paper in Austin TX. There were only a few comments a couple of them came from what appeared to be from self loathing whites. People at AR congregate, but where is the grass Roots?</p>
<p>I (a typical reader of AR) Urge ALL! AR readers, To write your comments on that papers local page, maybe even write the local gov. We need to show number, we need to show we are sick of it!</p>
<p>This is an outstanding way to spread the word of AR and let other whites who agree and just dont know about AR that they are not alone.</p>
<p>How many AR readers are there? - swell the ranks!</p>
<p>Whites are good decent people, I am tired of this witch hunt!</p>

		<p>Yes, this is accurate - authorities are operating under the idea that Blacks can never do hate crimes, because they are an historic victim group.</p>
<p>We made a video showing Attorney General Eric Holder (colored/mixed race not Black) coming out and saying that hate crime laws are not intended to protect all Americans just certain groups that have been &#8220;historic victims of who they are&#8221;</p>
<p>https://blip.tv/file/2350021</p>
<p>Please show this video to everyone you know and pass this story, pass the news that Whites are now being officially persecuted, the system isn&rsquo;t fair. We must organize and resist a very hostile unfair system.</p>

		<p>Boston Native: Your father had the &#8220;Audacity&#8221; to ask the Blacks gathered below the Apartment window to please keep it down, as your family was trying to sleep. Outrageous! No White man should ever ask a Black to act Civilized. Are you mad, man? Blacks have been &#8220;oppressed&#8221; by such requests. </p>
<p>By the way, Officer Crowley stated in his News interview, which was later put on You Tube, that he did not vote for Barry. I am sure that number has risen dramatically in the Cambridge Police Department, in Sgt. Crowely&rsquo;s family, and Town. </p>

		<p>I worked in Austin a couple of years and am now thankfully gone from there.  What I can say is that the east side is deplorable, dirty, and infested.  </p>
<p>I lived in an area near the University campus near downtown and can vouch for the fact that it was all mostly black, and more and more you would start to see whites moving in and you had the blacks complaining that taxes were going to go up etc which is funny because the majority of them don&rsquo;t work just like some areas here in chicago.  </p>
