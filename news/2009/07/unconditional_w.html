<h1>Unconditional Welcome</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Corbett, The Herald (Newcastle, NSW), July 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It should not surprise anyone that the Australian jailing rates of people of different countries of birth varies and varies greatly. I set about compiling such a list of these jailing rates when I learnt this week that statistics on crime by country of birth are not readily available. At the time I was seeking material for a column and blog on our national reluctance to deport visitors who prey on us criminally.</p>
<p>I compiled the list here by marrying country-of-birth statistics in an Australian Bureau of Statistics report, Prisoners in Australia 2008, with 2006 census figures for population by country of birth. In yesterday&rsquo;s blog I told how people in Australia who were born in Italy are the least likely to commit a serious crime, or more accurately are the least likely to be jailed for a serious crime, with one in 2620 of them being in jail for such a crime in 2007/08. Here is the full list of 30:</p>
<p>[<em>AR News Editor&rsquo;s note: The countries are ranked in reverse order of likelihood to have sent to prison immigrants who are in Australia. Immigrants from Italy are the most law-abiding, followed by Indians and Dutch. The large number in each entry is the number of law-abiding immigrants from each country for each immigrant who is in jail. In other words, one in 2,620 Italian immigrants to Australia is in jail. At the other, most crime-prone extreme  &mdash;  see the 30th entry  &mdash;  one in just 137 Tongan immigrants is in jail. Australians, themselves, are 17th on the list. Nationalities 18 through 30 are therefore more crime-prone than Australians. Nationalities 1 through 16 are less crime-prone.</p>
<p>[The other numbers, 14th, 15th, etc., indicate the ranking for particular crimes. For example, Indians are the second-most law-abiding immigrants, but are only 14th-most law-abiding when it comes to murder.]</em></p>
<p>1. Italy (one in) 2620. None jailed for robbery.</p>
<p>2. India 2195. High murder rate, at 14th.</p>
<p>3. Netherlands 2192. High sex assault, 17th; no robbery.</p>
<p>4. South Africa 1964. High drug crime, 14th.</p>
<p>5. Greece 1896. Relatively high murder and drugs; low robbery.</p>
<p>6. Germany 1868. 15th in sex assault.</p>
<p>7. UK 1632. Low drugs.</p>
<p>8. Sri Lanka 1596. 19th in sex assault; lowest drug crime.</p>
<p>9. The Philippines 1545. Low sex crime.</p>
<p>10. Malaysia 1465. No robbery; low sex crime, 4th.</p>
<p>11. Hong Kong 1305. High drug crime, 17th.</p>
<p>12. China 1208. No sex crime; 20th for drug offences.</p>
<p>13. Singapore 999. No robberies; high drug crime, 26th.</p>
<p>14. United States 907. No robbery.</p>
<p>15. Canada 810. No robbery.</p>
<p>16. Yugoslavia 730. Murder 21st, drugs 23rd.</p>
<p>17. Australia 637. Low drugs, 6th.</p>
<p>18. Thailand 598. No sex assault.</p>
<p>19. Cambodia 570 (in front of Iraq by a whisker). No sex assault; high drugs, 28th.</p>
<p>20. Iraq 570. Lower for robbery, 13th.</p>
<p>21. New Zealand 514. Lower drugs, 12th.</p>
<p>22. Turkey 395. Higher murder, 27th; lower robbery, 12th.</p>
<p>23. Fiji 394. Very low drugs, 4th.</p>
<p>24. Papua New Guinea 387. Lower robbery, 14th; lower drugs, 15th.</p>
<p>25. Sudan 380. Low drugs at 11th.</p>
<p>26. Lebanon 358. Lower sex assault, 12th.</p>
<p>27. Romania 266. No murder; no sex assault; lower robbery, 15th; second highest drugs, 29th.</p>
<p>28. Vietnam 233. Highest drugs; low sex assault, 8th.</p>
<p>29. Samoa 173. Second highest murder; lower drugs, 13th.</p>
<p>30. Tonga 137. Highest murder; high sex assault, robbery, drugs.</p>
<p>Is there a point at which the criminal record of certain nationalities of migrants and visa-free visitors to Australia becomes unacceptable? Or should we smile a welcome while being murdered, sexually assaulted, robbed and beaten?<br>

		<p>These statistics only tell which country a criminal came from.  They do not tell what race they are.  There is no question that many of those criminals from &#8220;white&#8221; countries, were not originally from those countries (or their parents were not).  In other words, &#8220;German&#8221; may mean &#8220;Turkish&#8221; and &#8220;Dutch&#8221; may mean &#8220;Congolese&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I know I&rsquo;m &#8216;preaching to the converted&rsquo;, and the statistics confirm what I&rsquo;m about to say, but Pacific Islanders (generally Samoans and Tongans) seem to be experts at intimidation and outright criminal behaviour here in Australia, closely following by the regular perp &#8216;man of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean appearance&rsquo;.  New Zealand is low down the list, mainly because of Maoris who have flooded into cities such as Sydney.  Forget the travel brochures that show cuddly, warm and friendly Pacific Islanders!   </p>

		<p>It should be noted there is a high murder/assault rate between Samoans/Tongans who bring their ethnic rivalries with them when they come to Aust/NZ.  Over the last year there has been a spate of violent carjackings /home invasions in Auckland NZ(where I live)In every instance the perps have been polynesian and the victims have been Asian or European-often elderly.<br>

<p>Perhaps I am misreading this, but it appears to me, knowing what little I know, that the majority of sex crimes are connected to countries and peoples that are muslims. Am I wrong in this?</p>

		<p>Is it me, or are these statistics really quite meaningless. The only rationale I can deduce is non-Whites are far more likely to do crimes&hellip; something we can establish right here in America without much effort. A safe bet being that Blacks and Hispanics are responsible, collectively, for probably 85% of all crime; Whites and other racial groups for the remaining 15%.</p>

<p>What I am about to say was something explained to me by an Australian chatroom buddy (and on-and-off AR reader) about differences between the United States and Australia, and its white populations.  So I&rsquo;m asking all of us, Aussies especially, to keep that in mind, because it might sound like a swipe and an insult, and would be if it were an original thought on my part.</p>
<p>In Australia, the standards for criminal justice are lower in America.  Or, to put it another way, Australia&rsquo;s leniency toward criminal behavior is much higher than America&rsquo;s.  On the flip side, Australia&rsquo;s gun control laws are far stricter than America&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The United States of America came to life as a bastion and colony for freedom-seeking Britons (and eventually other whites) fleeing religious persecutions, religious wars, and various other niceties.  Australia was founded as a penal colony, where England exiled major and minor habitual criminals.  America&rsquo;s indigenous population was organized, decently intelligent, and vicious, and put up a hard and long fight against their white conquerers, ended not much more than a century ago.  Australia&rsquo;s indigenous population had almost no intelligence (until whites explained it to them, they weren&rsquo;t able to link sex and pregnancy), weren&rsquo;t organized at all, were slothful (and still are, Abos drowning in dry rivers where they fall to sleep and wind up flooding is a frequent occurrence, they still haven&rsquo;t the sense to avoid river channels as overnight bunks), and put up just about zero resistance to white occupation.  Put those two things together, and it made sense to give Americans, with their individualist mindset and an Amerindian opposition guns, and no sense to give Australians, basically jailbirds with no real resistance, guns.  </p>
<p>For the same reason that the criminal justice system in black American communities is lenient, so is the Australian one compared to the American one.  I mean, who is going to throw the book at people, and lock them up and throw away the key, when you&rsquo;re closely related to such people?  The aforementioned Australian chatroom buddy told me everything he&rsquo;s done, and everything his low-down no-account good for nothing brother has done.  He himself has never served a day in a jail or prison (other than overnight detention), if he were American, he would have already done one or two prison bids.  His brother has done time in jails, and a little more than a year in a New South Wales prison.  If his brother were American, he&rsquo;d have a decades long bid.  </p>
<p>Another thing that I was made to understand about Australians is their transiency.  Social welfare programs are portable enough, and the expectancy of job tenure is low, because Australians love to all of a sudden get up and move from one place to another.  My chatroom buddy is a native of Sydney&rsquo;s western suburbs, and has lived in Wollongong, Bateman&rsquo;s Bay, Orange and Nowra, all in NSW, and in Cairns and twice in Townsville, QLD.  His parents shifted back and forth several times between the western suburbs of Sydney and various points on the south coast of NSW.</p>
<p>Even with all this wind to their faces, Australians (the white ones) have the highest standard of living in the Pacific Rim, much better than the much-praised Japanese.</p>

		<p>The American Colonies were used as a dumping ground for criminals by Great Britain up until the time of the American Revolution.Australia was chosen as a new penal colony and the first fleet sailed into Botany Bay on 26th January 1788.<br>
The anti-authoritarian-take the law into your own hands culture is a long established aspect of white Australia(called&rsquo;being a Larrakin&rsquo;)A good example of this was the recent Cronulla riots,when white Australian youths rose up against lebanese muslim criminals.</p>

		<p>The biggest criminal category is missing, that is, stripping all Australians of their right to defend themselves with firearms.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Howard  &mdash;  just two months into his eleven-and-a-half years in power  &mdash;  seized the chance to overhaul Australia&rsquo;s gun laws, trampling all opposition to make them among the strictest in the developed world. &#8220;I hate guns,&#8221; he said at the time. &#8220;One of the things I don&rsquo;t admire about America is their slavish love of guns &hellip; We do not want the American disease imported into Australia.&#8221; Howard argued the tougher laws would make Australia safer. But 12 years on, new research suggests the government response to Port Arthur was a waste of public money and has made no difference to the country&rsquo;s gun-related death rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;11/99 Aussie Gun Ban  <br>
Sunday, 28 September 2008 19:00  <br>
Going Down, Down Under<br>
by GOA founder Sen. H. L. Richardson, (Retired)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s study the horror of what&rsquo;s happening to our Australian, English, Canadian and South African gun owning friends. The Aussies, like us, are a gun owning population; or should we say, were. The Australian continent is a vast, arid land, populated with only 19 million people. It also has an abundance of varmints, a pest problem of major proportions. It is little wonder that practically every rural house contained a firearm, used for the control of these bothersome critters.</p>
<p>The crime rate in Australia has been historically low: 1.8 per 100,000. It is an isolated country with no borders for the illegal to slip across. It has been rightfully referred to as a sleepy, peaceful land. That is, until the leftist government implemented a draconian gun confiscation policy.</p>
<p>For years, the Labor party [socialists] and the Liberals [conservative] were closely balanced  &mdash;   a six-percent swing one way or the other could change their parliament. A small but vocal group of hard leftists split off and formed the Australian Democrat Party. They held few seats in Parliament; however, they have been mouthy, and the driving force behind the anti-gun movement.</p>
<p>On April 28th 1996, a maniac shot 35 people in Port Arthur. The media went ballistic, screaming about the evil of &#8220;assault&#8221; firearms. Australians were shocked. Nothing like this had ever happened in sleepy, peaceful Australia. The shrill cry and incessant anti-gun propaganda paid off and, in just 12 days, Federal resolutions were passed and the states enacted them into laws.</p>
<p>What did they enact? Did they just go after &#8220;ugly&#8221; guns, those military look-alike assault weapons? Think again! They outlawed every semi-auto, even those &#8220;pretty&#8221; duck guns, the Browning A5 and the Remington 1100&rsquo;s. They even struck down pump shotguns; the Winchester model 12 and the Remington 870 are two examples. The law read &#8220;Any pump shotgun with a magazine capacity of 5 rounds or less.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you own a Browning BAR rifle? Banned. How about a Winchester Model 100? Out of luck, all semi-auto hunting rifles were outlawed as well. They didn&rsquo;t miss a one.</p>
<p>You may ask, &#8220;Surely they left 22&rsquo;s alone, didn&rsquo;t they?&#8221; Nope, the criteria the government used was simple. If it&rsquo;s a semi-auto, it&rsquo;s gone. If caught with one of these &#8220;illegal&#8221; firearms, the crime was considered serious, punishable by multiple years in prison.</p>
<p>The Australian government offered to buy back all of the listed firearms. They then imposed a 1% tax on everybody to raise the money necessary to secure the &#8220;illegal&#8221; firearms. The massive 500 million buy back program was quickly, but poorly, implemented. Of the estimated 7 million firearms, roughly 40% are now prohibited. Close to 2.8 million firearms should have been surrendered to authorities. Was it a success? Hardly. Less than 25%, or 640,000 weapons, were turned in.</p>
<p>Gun Control and left-wing politicians said great things about the new law. A university of criminology professor stated, &#8220;It is probable that the crime rate will drop by up to 20 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing of the sort happened, in fact just the opposite took place. In 1997, just 12 months after the new laws went into effect, across Australia homicides jumped 3.2 percent, armed robberies were up a whopping 44 percent, assaults up 8.6 and in the state of Victoria there was a 300 percent increase in homicides. Prior to the new dictatorial anti-gun laws, statistics showed a steady decrease in armed robberies with firearms; now, there has been a dramatic increase in break-ins, especially against the elderly.</p>
<p>In 1998, in the state of South Australia, robbery with a firearm increased nearly 60 percent. In 1999, new figures reveal that the assault rates in the state of NSW has risen almost 20 percent.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that the crime rate for burglary in America is now substantially less than Australia, Canada, and Britain. The data from a comprehensive study from the University of Chicago [Lott, Mustard] showed that in these same three countries, people were home almost half of the time when the burglaries were committed.</p>
<p>In the US, it was less than 13%. Fear of firearms in the American home was the reason given.</p>
<p>Again, in Australia, Canada and Britain, all handguns were already severely controlled. Failure to yearly re-register in a prompt manner could bring law enforcement to the doorstep to confiscate the firearm.</p>
<p>Reasons must be given why anyone needs a license. The government lists only 10 reasons for owning a firearm  &mdash;   protection of self and family is not considered a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; request!</p>
<p>Guns aren&rsquo;t the only things prohibited.</p>
<p>In 1998, a new law was passed outlawing an assortment of knives. The fine for owning a classic Bowie knife? Up to $10,000 or two years in the crow bar motel. Owning handcuffs is prohibited. Caught with one of these items, the fine is up to $11,000 or up to 14 years in prison.</p>
<p>Hunting anywhere other than private property is now extremely difficult, where one must have written permission by the owner. One has to acquire a permit from government to hunt on government-controlled land. The Australian government is under no obligation to honor hunting requests and it is common for permits to be refused.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As a proud Aussie I am not sure how much these statistics<br>
are truthful except to show the criminal propensity(and low<br>
intelligence) of Pacific Islanders and Sudanese&hellip;<br>
 The media here  would have us assume that the local Italian mafia are running the drug cartels but as we can see the vast majority of Italian born and Italian decended Australians are decent law abiding,decent  hard working citizens.<br>
 From my own experience Aborigines, Pacific islanders,Middle East (esp Lebanese Muslims) and Sub Saharan Africans are most crime prone with a few East Europeans(esp Roamnians)involved in fraud and the drug trade.<br>
 Unlike America our black and hispanic population is still thankfully relatively small and crime,is apart from the big cities,not a considerable social problem.<br>
Our biggest enemies are probably  our lucklustre politicians and their liberal cohorts who go soft on crime and look to increasing immigation from those aforementioned countries which are the   most idle, crime prone and a liabiltiy to this great nation              <br>

<p>This thing is, until guns were largely barred, Australia had guns, certainly in the rural areas, and crime was very low. It&rsquo;s not guns, it&rsquo;s certain kinds of immigrants. </p>
