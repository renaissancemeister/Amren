<h1>Swim Club Offers Olive Branch After Racism Allegations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt, CNN, July 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A suburban Philadelphia swim club has invited children from a largely minority day-care center to come back after a June reversal that fueled allegations of racism against the club, a spokeswoman said Sunday.</p>
<p>The development came during a hastily called Sunday afternoon meeting of the Valley Club in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. Club members voted overwhelmingly to try to work things out with the day-care center, which accused some swim club members of making racist comments to black and Hispanic children contracted to use the pool, said Bernice Duesler, the club director&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>Duesler said the club canceled its contract with the Creative Steps day-care because of safety, crowding and noise concerns, not racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as we can work out safety issues, we&rsquo;d like to have them back,&#8221; she told CNN.</p>
<p>She said the club has been subpoenaed by the state Human Rights Commission, which has begun a fact-finding investigation, &#8220;and the legal advice was to try to get together with these camps, &#8221; Duesler added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Swimming privileges for about 65 children from Creative Steps were revoked after their first visit June 29. Some children said white members of the club made racist comments to the children, asking why &#8220;black children were there&#8221; and raising concerns that &#8220;they might steal from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Days later, the day-care center&rsquo;s $1,950 check was returned, Wright said.</p>
<p>Club director John Duesler told CNN that he had underestimated the amount of children who would participate, and the club was unable to supervise that many kids. He called his club &#8220;very diverse,&#8221; and said it had offered to let day camps in the Philadelphia area use his facility after budget cuts forced some pools in the area to close.</p>
<p>Wright [Alethea Wright, Creative Steps&rsquo; director] has rejected the camp&rsquo;s contention that the swim club&rsquo;s pool was overcrowded. The club had accepted a 10-to-1 ratio of children to adults and was considering adding up to three lifeguards, according to e-mails obtained by CNN.</p>
<p>But John Duesler said last week that the Valley Club also canceled contracts with two other day-care centers because of safety and overcrowding issues.</p>
<p>Bernice Duesler said she wasn&rsquo;t yet sure how the club will &#8220;reach out&#8221; to Creative Steps and the other two camps. And Wright said she still has concerns about the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the members who made those comments still there?&#8221; she asked.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;minority children&#8221; got to swim at Girard College and the local Jewish Community Center the last week or while all this was going on. Meanwhile, the swim club was shut down for a good part of the time. But you never hear any complaints about how the children who belonged to the club were without their swimming pool during all this time.</p>
<p>More double standards. Now that the &#8220;minority children&#8221; are going to be allowed to come, I wonder whether anyone else will bother to show up. This will be very interesting to watch unfold.</p>

		<p>The Valley Swim Club showed fear in front of the dog, and as a result, the dog is going to do nothing but bark at them and try to tear them to shreds.  Denny&rsquo;s backed down to civil rights pressure, and the civil rights crowd still picks on Denny&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Note in the Confederate Flag issue:  South Carolina gave in by moving the Flag from the state house dome to a ground-level memorial.  The NAACP is still barking.  Mississippi voted in April 2001, 90% of whites and 20% of blacks voted to keep the Confederateness of the existing state flag.  The NAACP doesn&rsquo;t bark at Mississippi anymore.  That&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s nothing to get.</p>

		<p>Well, there goes another white freedom of association club down the tubes. We all knew they&rsquo;d buckle under in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>As proof of the clubs &#8220;new&#8221; commitment to anti-racism, the director and selected cohorts, will go on a witch- hunt for those dastardly whites who had the nerve to verbally protest.  These white victims will then be sacrificed to the black gods of the underworld as proof of the clubs unyielding loyalty, or should I call it fear?</p>
<p>Blacks cry foul at the slightest provocation and they&rsquo;re rewarded for it and that&rsquo;s why they keep doing it. Too many whites, for far too long, have created this monster for themselves and can&rsquo;t cope with the consequences.</p>

		<p>I certainly consider it a safety issue. But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that the swim club blew it. First, by taking the money without any discussion regarding the number of children allowed at a time. And then by just kicking them all out at the drop of a hat. They opened themselves up to criticism through their incompetence. But now they&rsquo;re just taking a bad situation and making it worse. The day camps will never be happy and will just be looking to find fault. And this will drive away the rest of their customer base. Appeasement and pandering never work.</p>

		<p>If I were swimming at a private pool where I had paid a large membership fee and suddenly there were masses of &#8220;underprivileged&#8221; kids crowding the pool, making loud noise and possibly harassing myself and other members I would make a stink too, irregardless of the race of the kids. If there had been smaller groups of kids and they behaved themselves I would not have a problem. There was also a safety issue, most of the kids did not know how to swim and were restricted to the shallow end of the pool which contituted only about 1/3 of the entire area availble. If this &#8220;camp&#8221; or &#8220;daycare&#8221; agreed to send 10 kids at a time on different days we would not even be having this conversation. </p>

		<p>Did I read somewhere that the swim club was a private club? If so, they can invite those they want or keep out those they don&rsquo;t want. Or will the powers-that-be rule out private clubs or institutions because they aren&rsquo;t &#8220;diverse&#8221; enough? How about starting your own club and include only those you want? That&rsquo;s the meaning of private.</p>

		<p>Does anyone here think that those &#8220;campers&#8221; from the hood are going to settle for this! Not a chance! They&rsquo;ve got Whitey just were they want them- - as planned, and now it&rsquo;s time to pay up. I&rsquo;m not sure, but I believe I heard that they came to this swim club because theirs [a YMCA I believe] had been shut down due to their funds being cut off. If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;d like to know WHY the funds were cut off. Was it constant vandalism, theft, crime- - what!! I don&rsquo;t ever recall any YMCA around the ares that I lived having their funds cut off.  </p>

<p>Again we see this pernicious(and almost entirely anti-White) language. Evidently, not only swimming, but swimming with White people is a &#8220;Human Right.&#8221; Needless to say, that pretty much sums up the ludicrous folly that is Human Rights. If it all weren&rsquo;t so dangerous and maddening it would be comical.</p>

		<p>I was wondering about this. The pool is about the size of the pool we had at the summer camp I worked at years ago. We never allowed more than 30 children at a time. It would be dangerious to have more. This is with staff councelors who are trained to deal with emergencies. Odds are they never talked what should be done.<br/>
    Typical african overreaction. And if one of the black darlings drowned, they would be so angry.</p>

		<p>What comments were said to the children?Is it possible that these children lied about what was said.I haven&rsquo;t heard any information about the context of  the statements.It is so easy to accuse white people today because the media assumes the worse of us.Blacks can beat whites, call them crackers tell them this is our country and this is our black area.Then the clueless police will say &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think this is a hate crime&#8221;.Once again if one white looked at the black children and didn&rsquo;t worship them on the spot then cries of racism.America&rsquo;s sacred cows &#8220;black people&#8221;and that is why not one journalist would dare to ask B.O. the pres about his racist views and racist friends.</p>

		<p>I am sure that the black kids heard something that was not actually said. More than likely the person said something like &#8220;those kids sure are noisy and out of control&#8221; and the poor oppressed, think skinned minorities heard &#8220;why are all these black kids here?&#8221; Often when there are cases like this things get blown way out of proportion and people get accused of things that never really happened. It is often the same in black beatdowns, the victim is so injured that he or she does not remember what exactly happened and then the perpetrator can say something like &#8220;they called me the N word and I lost control&#8221; and then have a major sentence reduction. The best protection against that would be to avoid blacks period, especially if you see them in big crowds and you are alone. </p>

		<p>Where i live we have a health club it isn&rsquo;t inexpensive to go there and you still have a fair number of blacks that attend. However there is this do good white minister that brings blacks to the club and pays their fees for a day. They are a real nusiance and I have stopped going because of this.</p>

		<p>This club will be out of business by the end of the year, as well it should be.</p>
<p>Were the dues-paying members asked if this were OK with them?</p>
<p>I would drop my membership to such a club immediately as I would not want my White children or grandchildren to attend a private club, to which I pay dues, that contracts its pool out to blacks of any age.  I would be furious beyond words if I this happened to me.</p>
<p>This is the reason so many Whites in California build their own backyard pools and play areas for their kids  &mdash;  and then build a 9-foot wall around their property.  I have seen some unbelievable backyards with outdoor kitchens, fountains, ponds, salt-water swimming pools, and even small water parks for the kiddies.  </p>
<p>This is because our once-pristine beaches are disgusting, loud, overcrowded with mexicans, filthy and the public pools and parks have either been closed or taken over and turned into outdoor toilets by NAMs.</p>

		<p>I saw on the news today they are really turning the screws on the club now, they are refusing this peace offering to allow them back in, the children have apparently now been all coached to say they don&rsquo;t want to return to the club and are too traumatized and scarred.</p>
<p>So in other words, a grave injustice has occurred, and it cannot now be remedied by a simple and reasonable solution such as letting the children swim in the pool (saftey and overcrowding be damned).  Hmmm&hellip; I wonder what the remedy for this terrible tragedy will be? </p>
<p>The media is also really picking up a head of steam on this story. Ever afflicted with amnesia regarding past racial stories (Crystal Gail Who?) they are now reporting as solemn fact all the wild allegations of racist comments made by the pool members and staff. </p>
<p>Can you imagine this actually happening? I mean have you ever in your whole life seen a normal respectable suburban white person just go up to a black person, let alone a child and make a racist comment? It is unfathomable in our society  &mdash;  you would be tarred and feathered, fired from your job and divorced from your spouse, ostracized from society.</p>
<p>There is no way to disprove these wild claims of racist comments of course. The crazy wild rumor machine in the black mind gathers steam pretty quickly</p>
<p>Someone saying: &#8220;They probably think we will steal from them&#8221;, quickly becomes </p>
<p>&#8220;I HEARD them say we will steal from them&#8221; </p>
<p>Which then becomes </p>
<p>&#8220;I heard some blond haired white lady say we will  steal from them and then called me the &#8220;N-Word&#8221;, etc. ad nauseam.</p>
<p><br/>
Not much to do if you are in this situation, but open your wallet write out a check for the largest number you can think of, grovel for a few days, resign in disgrace from your job and be hated and demonized for the rest of your life. </p>

		<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the owner of the daycare take the black kids to one of Philadelphia&rsquo;s free Department of Recreation swimming pools?  After the city budget cuts were implemented this year, the only free city pools left open in Philadelphia were in predominately black neighborhoods.  For the daycare owner to sign a contract to haul the kids to a predominately white swimming pool in the suburbs of Philadelphia is baffling to me.</p>

		<p>We have been so indoctrinated with a distorted, leftist notion of &#8220;rights&#8221; that we have forgotten all about our property rights. If a private club wants to keep out blacks, then they should every right to do so without having to explain their decision to anyone for any reason.I think that it is pretty obvious that a private club of any kind should be able to dictate who its members are. The national council of La Raza does! Oops! I forgot that it&rsquo;s okay in their case because it is an organization of blacks! </p>
