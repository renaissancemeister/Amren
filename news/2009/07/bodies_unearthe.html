<h1>Bodies Unearthed at Alsip Cemetery</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lolly Bowean, Steve Schmadeke and Alena Scarver, Chicago Tribune, July 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five employees of the historic Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip were taken into custody Wednesday after authorities learned numerous bodies had been dug up and the grave sites were illegally resold, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said.</p>
<p>Detectives discovered a pile of bones  &mdash;  from more than 100 decomposed bodies  &mdash;  above ground and uncovered in an overgrown, fenced-off portion of the cemetery, Dart said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the first predominantly African-American cemeteries in the area, Burr Oak is home to many historic figures, including Emmett Till, blues legend Dinah Washington and heavyweight boxing champion Ezzard Charles.</p>
<p>Dart said he was certain Till&rsquo;s remains were not disturbed, but he could not ensure the preservation of the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot give people definitive answers at this point,&#8221; he said, adding they were working with forensic medical examiners to try to identify the remains.</p>
<p>None of the remains had been removed from the site, said Steve Patterson, a sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman. The state&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s office and FBI are also investigating, Dart said.</p>
<p>In recent years the cemetery at 4400 W. 127th St. has drawn complaints for overgrown grass, sunken grave sites and flooding.</p>
<p>Police told industry experts, consulted as they investigated the case, that the conspirators probably took in around $300,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s police learned of the grave-reselling scheme six weeks ago when they were contacted by the Arizona-based cemetery owners, Perpetua Inc., who told police they were concerned about possible financial wrongdoing, Dart said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dart said possible felony charges involve unearthing the dead, conspiracy and financial crimes.</p>

		<p>I saw on the news that Jesse Jackson has inserted himself into this story, which wasn&rsquo;t surprising given the combination of TV cameras and Black victims. But what I found very surprising was that it was the first time (that I can recall) where Jackson has taken the case of Black victims&hellip;.being victimized by Black perps. </p>
<p>This is another sad example of &#8220;affinity fraud&#8221; where greedy crooks specifically target people of the same race, religion or ethnicity, urging them to keep their business &#8220;in the family,&#8221; because those nasty &#8220;outsiders&#8221; only want to rip them off.</p>

		<p>This is a cemetery that has historically catered to blacks. Most of its employees are blacks also. </p>
<p>Maintenance issues have plagued this and other black operated cemeteries for years before this most recent scandal broke. In suburban Glenwood, coffins were literally resurfacing when cemetery workers buried bodies in shallow graves that flooded with water after every rainstorm. </p>

		<p>As much as I am a race realist, I have to admit that I have heard of White funeral directors doing the same thing. I&rsquo;m sure others on here have also. We really don&rsquo;t have any argument on this one in my opinion</p>

		<p>CBS 11 reports:</p>
<p><i>&hellip;Keith Nicks has a lengthy criminal record, although he was only ever found guilty of disorderly conduct. He was charged at various points with assault, domestic battery and violating an order of protection, but the charges were dropped.</i></p>
<p>Towns has no prior criminal charges. Criminal background information for Dailey and for Terrence Nicks was not immediately learned&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;Dart said Thursday that he was unable to provide concrete information to family members about their loved ones&rsquo; graves.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew there was going to be a lot of people coming here, for all the obvious reasons, but we weren&rsquo;t quite aware of the magnitude of this. We had people here at midnight, 1, 2 in the morning,&#8221; Dart said. </p>
<p>Midnight? 1am?</p>
<p>Yes, that sounds like blacks.</p>

		<p>I disagree with Tom S.  The news accounts I heard had a racial angle, strongly emphasizing that it was a black cemetery that was being vandalized and implying that white developers were digging up graves and disposing of the remains in an effort to steal the property.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of white funeral directors doing this. I am not saying they haven&rsquo;t, but that I am unfamiliar with them doing the same thing. Do you have links to any news stories? Just curious. <br>
One thing for sure, we know exactly how our white cemetaries and our ancestors remains will be treated when we are a minority race! </p>

		<p>I am on the fence on this one, it is disturbing yes if it was your relatives bones that were chucked in a dumpster or something, but cemeteries of all varieties are kind of a doomed business&hellip; </p>
<p>They profit from selling plots but when the plots are all sold then the cash stops pouring in. You can&rsquo;t charge rent to the dead, so you have to go out of business. Except when you go out of business, then you have thousands of overgrown neglected graves and people are outraged  &mdash;  from a business standpoint operating a cemetery is a lose lose proposition.</p>
<p>The cemetery can&rsquo;t make a profit to keep itself in business when they are full like this, so to keep the maintence men employed and the ground up kept, logically horrible things sometimes have to happen. </p>
<p>They could just shut down and let weeds and garbage fill the cemetery and they would still be under the gun and Jessee would be hounding them for that.</p>
<p>I hope when I die somebody just buries me in a pleasant clearing in the forest or something.  Cemeteries are creepy and depressing.<br>

		<p>Sounds a lot like the Tri-State Crematory fiasco. A black crematory operator did not repair hte crematorium when it broke down (it needed a cheap $200 part) but he did keep taking in bodies.</p>
<p>He ended up taking in over 200 corpses and just dumped them in piles on his property, then returned cement dust to the grieving families. I guess he thought no one would ever notice the piles of bodies.</p>
<p>I think there is a racial component. Dumping hundreds of bodies in piles out in the open (especially on your own land) will be discovered eventually. In both cases there were groups of blacks involved, and they all seemed to think it was a good idea and it wouldn&rsquo;t become a problem. That is not too bright.</p>

		<p>Grave sites are plentiful and most vacant plots do not command much interest when offered for sale. The exception to this general statement is that in a select few cemeteries, burial space is at a premium because these are deemed to be desirable cemeteries. When these cemeteries near capacity, grave prices sky rocket. This was not the case at Burr Oaks Cemetery. Graves were available for sale, but the swindlers did not stand to pocket an illegal profit selling graves legitimately. <br>
 <br>
What happened here is blacks preying upon other blacks. Since fewer blacks maintain checking accounts than whites do, many of their transactions are typically handled in cash (I am often amazed at how often blacks carry large amounts of cash to settle bills). The swindlers realized that they could pocket this cash by reselling the same graves without documenting the transactions on the books. The four thieves arrested yesterday cheated the public and the owners of the cemetery.<br>
 <br>
The cemetery owners neglected to supervise Burr Oaks and this, of course, allowed the swindlers an opportunity to rip off the public. </p>

A similar situation happened a few years back with a mortuary.</p>
<p>Blacks complain they don&rsquo;t even have their own funeral parlors anymore. They should be glad.</p>

		<p>Seems to me a typical combination that seems to point in one racial direction statistically: laziness and greed. When I hear those two faults combined in one deed I can be 99% sure of &#8216;who done it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When I first heard the  story, with no mention of the racial make-up of the cemetery, I figured &#8216;it was most likely the owners/operators/employees of the cemetery&rsquo;, which were likely black, and that meant likely a black cemetery. Algebra is really very simple.</p>

		<p>This story is getting lots of attention, but it is real nothing new in Chicago. Black swindlers have been preying upon their own gullible community for years by peddling worthless burial insurance policies and other prepaid funeral scams. Not too long ago, a funeral home director was cited for booking funerals and then not proceeding with embalming. He just pocketed the money and put the bodies in a refrigerator. He had dozens of corpses in cold storage. Another cemetery catering to blacks was in the news for burying coffins in shallow graves without concrete burial vaults. After a severe rain, many of the coffins resurfaced through the mud and began floating away. </p>

		<p>Why should we be surprised about anything in this story. Blacks tend to victimize their own all the time. Prior to the 1950&rsquo;s a lot of places had funeral homes that would serve as the local ambulance service. My mom worked at the Grady Hospital in Atlanta before she married and told me some stories about people who were in accidents of all types. The blacks would beg and plead with the cops to call a white funeral home to pick them up. The black funeral homes would drive them around until they bled to death. So this is nothing new. I am surprised that there are pictures of the accused. This is obviously related to white racism. </p>

		<p>Dont forget about the Black in Georgia who had hundreds of bodies sitting in sheds and in a pond outside his funeral home. And, in Detroit you have whites who are digging up their relatives from decades ago to get them the hell out.  No respect for living. Not surprised about their feeling for the dead.</p>

		<p>I seem to recall reading something on this site about how Black service providers, undertakers, lawyers, anybody, insists on cash up front, because they know that Blacks won&rsquo;t pay once the job is done.  I guess that the converse is true also: once you pay, the work won&rsquo;t be done.  It all reminds me of buying dope from a stranger: no trust.  </p>

<p>I does? Then why isn&rsquo;t in the news?</p>
<p>Are you referring to: &#8220;Darlington Memorial Cemetery volunteer caretaker John H. Williams stands near one of the toppled headstones Tuesday at the cemetery in Darlington. Starting last June 2008, Williams said, he started to notice more and more vandalism at the cemetery, which is on the National Register of Historic Places and is the first black cemetery in Darlington. Since then, Williams estimates at least 50 headstones have been pushed over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not the same thing.<br>

<p>AJ they were not digging them up and reusing hte plots because the cemetery was full. It was not full, they were dumping the bodies in an UNUSED part. They were digging them up so they could sell plots without the owners in AZ realizing and pocket the cash.</p>
<p>Seems like falsifying paperwork would have been easier.<br>
