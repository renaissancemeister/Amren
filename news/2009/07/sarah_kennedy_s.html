			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Niall Firth, Daily Mail (London), July 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Radio 2 presenter Sarah Kennedy has been chastised by the BBC for praising right-wing politician Enoch Powell during her show.</p>
<p>During her early-morning show on Wednesday, Kennedy, 59, described Powell as &#8216;the best prime minister this country never had&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Enoch Powell was famously sacked from the shadow cabinet by Ted Heath in 1968 after his &#8216;Rivers of Blood&rsquo; speech about the dangers of mass immigration.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the BBC said that the corporation had received 25 complaints by Friday and that the presenter had been &#8216;spoken to&rsquo; about the remark.</p>
<p>Rivers of blood: Sarah Kennedy has been &#8216;spoken to&rsquo; by the BBC for saying that right-wing politician Enoch Powell &#8216;was the best Prime Minister we never had&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;It was inappropriate for Sarah to offer an off-the-cuff political opinion and we have spoken to her and made that clear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is not the first time Kennedy has run into trouble over comments made on her show.</p>
<p>In 1999, she called a clergyman an &#8216;old prune, described fellow DJ Ken Bruce as an &#8216;old fool&rsquo; and accused a newsreader of soiling her underwear. She then took a week off work, citing exhaustion.</p>
<p>In 2007 she ran into a race row after she said she had almost run over a black pedestrian because his dark clothes made him &#8216;invisible&rsquo; at night.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s lucky he opened his mouth to yawn or do something and I saw him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In August 2007 she prompted a flood of complaints after slurring her way through her show, mispronouncing words and offering to send &#8216;panties&rsquo; to soldiers in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>A Radio 2 spokeswoman blamed a sore throat.</p>
<p>In his infamous &#8216;Rivers of Blood&rsquo; speech to Conservatives in Birmingham&rsquo;s Midland Hotel in 1968,  Enoch Powell spoke out the threats caused by the mass immigration of people from Britain&rsquo;s former colonies..</p>
<p>He also heavily criticised the planned anti-discrimination laws which would make it illegal to refuse service on grounds of race.</p>
<p>The speech was deliberately provocative in its views and language  &mdash;  with the use of the word &#8216;picaninnies&rsquo;, a 19th century slang term used in the southern states of America to describe the children of black slaves, causing particular offence.</p>
<p>It caused deep divisions in public opinion with Powell accused of inflaming racial hatred by many, but applauded by others for saying the unsayable.</p>
<p>He was quickly sacked from Edward Heath&rsquo;s shadow cabinet but he also received 120,000 letters of support.</p>

		<p>They sacked Powell but let in millions of immigrants who hate Britain, its culture and religion, and never intend to become English. Great Britain deserves the whirlwind it has sowed. Powell was a great prophet. </p>

		<p>It looks like she&rsquo;s about ready to be phased out. Another career ended.  It&rsquo;s surprising that she lasted this long   &mdash;   but this isn&rsquo;t the Continent.  Britain isn&rsquo;t quite that bad. Not yet. </p>
<p>In Germany, there was a very well known woman who had a popular TV program.  About a year ago or less, she made the unforgiveable  faux pas of paying a vague compliment to Hitler. This simply CANNOT be done!   NOTHING good can be said about nazis.   She was talking about the subject of families. What she said was  merely that the  government, under the Nazis, had a strong family program. As a result, she was abruptly removed from TV and has since become a non-person; her career in media is over and no one hears anything of her anymore.  </p>
<p>To Americans, such a black-out on free speech is hard to grasp.  In Germany  very recently, I had a discussion about this with an acquaintance who emphasized to me in the strongest terms that you cannot say ANYTHING good about nazis and such other right-wingers, or your career will be over and you will probably face prosecution.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s true!  It still cannot be said!   You cannot even say the nazis had a good highway-building program or that Hitler was kind to kittens.  All true  (after all, they did build the autobahn)   &mdash;    but YOU CANNOT SAY IT! </p>
<p>Does anyone remember this incident? There was an article about it on Amren, I&rsquo;m quite sure.  I would appreciate having my memory refreshed. It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago, within the past year.   I have searched, but  I cannot find it and I cannot remember her name either. </p>

		<p>The truth is you can offer an off-the-cuff political opinion as long as it is politically correct.  The government decides what opinions are politically correct.</p>
<p>England and the United States are in a race to see which can lose all freedom of speech first.  It is ironic since both claim to cherish freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Funny story..we used that term, non-derogatorily, to refer to black kids when I was a youngster.  I grew up in an almost white town in a very white county. My first year in college, in a heavily black city, I was amazed at the number of black children getting on the bus.  The northern NJ Jewish girl (fellow freshman) I was with looked at me puzzled, she didn&rsquo;t know what it meant!  Didn&rsquo;t realize they used the term in England.<br>

<p>There very well may have been - but do you really think the BBC would mention such it?  Furthermore, it could well be that only PC types even bother to listen to the BBC because it&rsquo;s so biased.  So naturally the letters they get will also be biased.</p>

A couple of figures from this article: </p>
<p>How many people supported Enoch Powell after what is rather misleadingly called the &#8220;Rivers of Blood&#8221; speech in 1968?</p>
<p>&#8220;He [Powell] was quickly sacked from Edward Heath&rsquo;s shadow cabinet but he also received 120,000 letters of support.&#8221;</p>
<p>I see. 120,000. That&rsquo;s a very large number. And how many people complained to the BBC that their broadcaster had praised Powell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A spokesman for the BBC said that the corporation had received 25 complaints by Friday&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do the math, BBC. You too, NuLabour. </p>

		<p>And to think I&rsquo;ve been relying on the BBC to tell the truth about the hellhole South Africa is turning into at the hands of blacks.  They comment on a subject that the American media is afraid to touch   &mdash;   the black failure to run South Africa. </p>

		<p>25 actual complaints? Enoch Powell got 120,000, letters, of support. The multicultists didn&rsquo;t let that sway them. But here in 2009, 25 complaints does the trick, if it agrees with the papers position.  </p>

		<p>Rivers of Blood is too right- reading the text of the speech it&rsquo;s small wonder the media decry his supporters- he was too right by half.</p>
<p>Out in France, though, it seems the Government is simply refusing to give out crime rates to do with the ongoing race riots:</p>
