<h1>Importing the Uninsured</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James R. Edwards Jr., National Review Online, July 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to envision how health reform can avoid tripping the immigration booby trap. Approximately 15-22 percent of the 46 million residents of the United States without health coverage are illegal aliens. That&rsquo;s about 9 or 10 million people. More generally, a third of the foreign-born are uninsured, Census data analyzed by the Center for Immigration Studies show. That means something like 12.6 million people, or more than a fourth of the total uninsured, are immigrants, both legal and illegal. Since 1989, immigration is responsible for 71 percent of the rise in those without health insurance. The fact is, the problem of the uninsured would be a more manageable one if the U.S. were not admitting millions of uninsured immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For example, the HELP [Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions] bill&rsquo;s proponents hope to expand Medicaid so that everyone earning up to 50 percent above the federal poverty level can enroll (currently, Medicaid income requirements vary by state, with the poverty level being the usual limit). Since immigration law only requires relatives who sponsor someone for an immigrant visa to earn 25 percent above the poverty level, the end result would be that someone poor enough to qualify for Medicaid would be able to sponsor new immigrants to the U.S. {snip}</p>
<p>And under the Finance Committee&rsquo;s plan, tax credits for buying insurance would be available to individuals who earn up to three times the poverty level. (That&rsquo;s $32,490 for individuals and $66,150 for families of four.) Like other refundable tax credits  &mdash;  meaning that if your tax credit is worth more than you pay in taxes, the government sends you a check for the difference  &mdash;  this health-coverage tax credit would amount to a welfare-type subsidy funded by those Americans who pay taxes.</p>
<p>No health legislation on the table requires federal, state, or local agencies  &mdash;  or private institutions receiving federal funds  &mdash;  to check the immigration status of health-program applicants, so some of the money distributed via Medicaid and tax credits inevitably would go to illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Also, the HELP bill makes citizens and lawful aliens eligible for a new Right Choices program  &mdash;  an advocacy program providing Democrats jobs spending taxpayer money. And another part of the Finance Committee plan would exempt illegal immigrants from a mandate to buy insurance. Uninsured Americans would have to pay a fine, but uninsured illegal aliens would be off the hook  &mdash;  thus, they would have no reason to buy their own coverage or to stop receiving taxpayer-funded health services at clinics, emergency rooms, etc.</p>
<p>If the children&rsquo;s health reauthorization early this Congress is any indication, liberals intend to redistribute income even to aliens. The Pelosi Congress dropped requirements that SCHIP applicants document their legal status, dumbed down standards so stolen Social Security numbers can be accepted, and allowed illegal aliens onto SCHIP for up to 90 days.</p>
<p>A recent Rasmussen poll found 80 percent of American voters oppose covering illegal immigrants in any health-reform bill, while just 11 percent support it. And 70 percent oppose universal health care if illegal aliens are included.</p>

		<p>There was a time I thought Obama was just stupid, and didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing.  Now, I truly believe he is out to destroy the United States, and quickly, too.  Sadly, I blame the Republicans.  Obama is what he is.  But years of the Bush clan eating away at whatever was worthwhile in America soured most everyone against the Republicans.  Healthcare &#8220;reform&#8221; along with allowing HIV immigrants into the US (see yesterday&rsquo;s article) will completely destroy our health infrastructure.  Man, it&rsquo;s hard to be optimistic these days.</p>

		<p>Our &#8220;leaders&#8221; plan at immigration reform will give a path to citizenship to the 40 million illegals already here and their relatives. In an instant they will become covered by the health plan.</p>
<p>My thoughts were that &#8220;legalization&#8221; was intended to happen before the housing bubble bust..then the Government would have been bailing out &#8220;citizens&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google LaRaza and Health Care you will find the following:</p>
<p>Quote:<br>
&hellip;Yes [they said they would get free health care for illegal aliens], these are my notes, Mark. They actually got up and said &#8220;Latino children need health care more than whites&#8221;. And then they would say things like &#8220;you must go out into your communities, use words like &#8216;streamline&rsquo;, use phrases like &#8216;all workers&rsquo; and &#8216;all families&rsquo;,&#8221; because they said   &mdash;   and I quote   &mdash;   &#8220;If the American people find out that this bill is about giving health care to non-citizens, they will rise up against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;One of the quotes they said was, &#8220;We want to make sure we take care of barriers like verification, but we can streamline programs to the more affluent&#8221; and, quote, &#8220;Useless treatments for the elderly can be gone because we don&rsquo;t need to spend money for people who are going to die anyway.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Majority of Doctors, and nurses will be foreigners brought into<br>
this country under the H1B visa program from India, and<br>
Pakistan.  There will be a very few, if any White American<br>
Doctors employed in the Government National health Insurance programs.</p>

		<p>Just another symptom of the multicultural diversity madness that has gripped America by the throat and is slowly throttling the life out of her.</p>
<p>People have become fondly attached to the Emma Lazarus poem on the Statue of Liberty, and love the &#8220;Good Guy&#8221; image of an America that takes in the world&rsquo;s tired, hungry, poor, etc.   But they never stop to think in terms of global competition exactly what it means to continually bring in the lowest performing groups that will cost us taxpayers money for generations, instead of bringing in the best and brightest who could immediately contribute to the USA&rsquo;s economy without ever latching on to the taxpayer teat.  If American Whites had enough sense to insist that those best and brightest come from the most compatible nations of White Europeans and high performing East Asians, we could have avoided ruinous expense and the catastrophic, irreversible cultural damage that we are facing - all of it due to mass immigration from the 3rd world since 1965.</p>
<p>I truly think that many Whites have lost their minds.  They wouldn&rsquo;t support a &#8220;give me your lowest performers&#8221; philosophy for their kid&rsquo;s soccer team, for their favorite pro sports team, for their own companies, their own families, or even their own neighborhoods.  Yet at the national level, they happily embrace the fantasy and pretend that importing 10,000 Sudanese will benefit the USA just as richly as importing 10,000 Englishmen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s idiocy, and it is absolutely destroying our people and our nation.  </p>

		<p>The poor, ilegals, and all who don&rsquo;t have health care, are not presently being refused health care. Therefore, a national healthcare reform will benefit only those who are in control of the trillions of dollars being paid to the government. Americans, pull your head out of your buttocks, and wake up.</p>

<p>Here in Australia we were fed the same nonsense and we are suffering the same moral and economic decline due to third world immigration. Don&rsquo;t be fooled about those so called high performing east Asians as most are not high performing at all and many end up washing dishes or cleaning houses. Australia and America need to get back to importing people of white European stock only. I don&rsquo;t really care if people call me &#8216;racist&rsquo; as I know that common sense dictates that importing non-whites only reduces our standard of living.</p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t have it both ways in today&rsquo;s America. Either the illegals are specifically excluded from Obamacare or Medicare, or you keep them out of the emergency room. </p>
<p>The &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; argument by immigrant advocates that little kiddies should not be responsible for the sins of mama and papa resonates with the professional class that runs the hosptials and runs the health care government bureaucracy.</p>
<p> One way or the other, illegals will get health care, and probably free health care. Stop employers from hiring them, and you will get some of them to leave the USA and thus the health care system we taxpayers and real Americans pay for with our rapidly shrinking dollars.</p>

		<p>Of course, health care reform will benefit illegal immigrants BIG TIME, while costing AMERICAN TAXPAYERS BIG BUCKS!</p>
<p>The illegals complain about having to wait hours in the local E.R. facility for free healthcare. They want, expect, the same prompt treatment people with health care insurance and money to pay the co-pay get.</p>
<p>I am against ANY American being unable to get needed health care. But I am TOTALLY AGAINST the illegal immigrants and the free ride they get, courtesy of our American taxpayers! Let Mexico take care of its own. Why in hell should we American taxpayers have to suffer the cost.</p>

<p>This is so on the mark and I have said the same thing. Go to any job interview. They want the candidate that will best fit the company, one that has a proven track record of success. A law firm, for example wouldn&rsquo;t dream of hiring somebody who came in for an invervies dressed &#8220;arty&#8221; with no education or experience in law, just art. A business wouldn&rsquo;t hire a CEO who had come from a failed company. The NFL wouldn&rsquo;t hire the worst player or one from only losing teams, they want the best. Any American would agree. Yet, when it comes to immigration, Americans(and others) do the opposite, allowing people from failed countries to pour in en masse. With enough of these people from failed countries and you will have a failed country.</p>

		<p>These politicians are hypocrites. Can you see any of them standing in line for government rationed health care? I wonder if Hillary Clinton had to stand in line to get her elbow fixed.</p>
<p>Hell no she didn&rsquo;t. She probably had it taken care of with one of the finest doctors money can buy (taxpayer money of course). Most of these policiticans have never held a private sector job their entire life. They&rsquo;ve made a career out of stealing my money and giving it to those they feel need it.</p>
<p>You can bet your sweet that this national healthcare will take care of all the illegals and their family. Nope, not having it. Where did I put my pitchfork.</p>

		<p>What I find particularly insidious is that many in the media are helping to sell this insane proposal, insisting that only the wealthiest Americans will foot the bill.  I disagree.  The rich may see an increase in taxes but will weather this storm just fine.  The white middle class, on the other hand, will be reduced to serfdom.</p>
