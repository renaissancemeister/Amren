			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, July 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two men have been jailed after becoming the first in the UK to be convicted of inciting racial hatred via a foreign website.</p>
<p>Simon Sheppard, 51, of Selby in North Yorkshire, received four years and 10 months, and Stephen Whittle, 42, of Preston, two years and four months.</p>
<p>The men printed leaflets and controlled US websites featuring racist material.</p>
<p>They fled to the US after being convicted at Leeds Crown Court last year, but failed in an asylum bid.</p>
<p>Sheppard, of Brook Street, Selby, was found guilty of 11 offences and Whittle, of Avenham Lane, Preston, was found guilty of five offences at a trial in July last year.</p>
<p>Sheppard was convicted of a further five charges in January 2009.</p>
<p>However, before the jury in the first trial could return verdicts, both men fled to Los Angeles International airport and attempted to claim political asylum.</p>
<p>Their bid was thrown out by a US immigration judge.</p>
<p>The men were charged with publishing and distributing racially inflammatory material, and possessing racially inflammatory material with a view to distribution.</p>
<p>Leeds Crown Court was told Whittle wrote offensive articles that were then published on the internet by Sheppard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Judge Rodney Grant told the men their material was &#8220;abusive and insulting&#8221; and had the potential to cause &#8220;grave social harm&#8221;.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Such offences as these have, by their very nature, the potential to cause grave social harm, particularly in a society such as ours which has, for a number of years now, been multi-racial.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Groundbreaking case&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;These are serious offences. I can say without any hesitation that I have rarely seen, or had to read or consider, material which is so abusive and insulting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. towards racial groups within our own society.&#8221;</p>
<p>The investigation into Sheppard began when a complaint about a leaflet was reported to police in 2004 after it was pushed through the door of a synagogue in Blackpool.</p>
<p>It was traced back to a post office box in Hull registered to Sheppard.</p>
<p>Humberside Police later found a website featuring racially inflammatory material.</p>
<p>The pair thought that they could circumvent English law because their website was hosted in the US.</p>
<p>That, said Adil Khan, head of diversity and community cohesion at Humberside Police, makes their conviction a first.</p>
<p>&#8220;This case is groundbreaking,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is now that we&rsquo;ve been able to demonstrate that you&rsquo;ve got nowhere to hide; people have been hiding on [sic] the fact that this server was in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inciting racial hatred is a crime and one which seems to occur too regularly. This kind of material will not be tolerated as this lengthy investigation shows.&#8221;</p>

		<p>How is the UK any different from the Islamic Republic of Iran?  Both have fanatical leaders that enforce a state run religion.  In Iran it&rsquo;s Islam, in the UK the religion of the state is political correctness and diversity.  In Iran those that dissent are jailed or murdered, the UK stops at jailing those that dissent against the state religion but who knows, death by stoning after a sharia show trial could be coming soon.</p>

		<p>Notice that the perspective of the judge was that they should not be given asylum because we have a multiracial society and the website might be offensive to those people.  </p>
<p>No mention of freedom of speech or expression from this judge.  Remember the only true free speech is that which is offensive, otherwise what is so free about it?</p>
<p>Mr. Khan of the police is correct - soon there will be no place for whites to hide - except behind the barrel of a gun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile two more lives will be ruined, but life will go on for so much of the rest of our unsuspecting society - who won the Super Bowl and American Idol&hellip;?</p>

		<p>commentator michael savage could be the next one to be tried under this law. even though an american citizen rumors abound that brit home secretary has requested savage be handed over by the state dept. one of the problems with international law is that treaties often bind nations to act differently from what their own laws require. being accused of being a nazi can and has led to american citizens being deported and tried. hate speech laws being considered here in the states would indeed allow for americans to be tried in absentia, and if convicted, the feds can and have arrested and sent people off to be tried.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;towards racial groups within our own society.&#8221; Perhaps the racial groups should be repatriated to wherever they came from.  That way, they would no longer be &#8220;within their own society&#8221;.  Problem solved.</p>
<p>Also I wonder what rational, if any, there is for denying asylum to those who are denied freedom of speech in their own country.  I guess it depends which country and which speech now doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>The Bolsheviks merely took their show on the road after leaving Russia and are now here, thriving.  </p>
<p>I am literally praying, knowing full well that it&rsquo;s going to take more than prayer, that this all backfires on them.</p>
<p>But check this out:  a quote from the above article.<br>
&#8220;Judge Rodney Grant told the men their material was &ldquo;abusive and insulting&rdquo; and had the potential to cause &ldquo;grave social harm&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Such offences as these have, by their very nature, the potential to cause grave social harm, particularly in a society such as ours which has, for a number of years now, been multi-racial.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an indirect confession that all of the anti-White propaganda is deliberate and that all of this is a calculated and brutal assault on Whites and the West.</p>
<p>The sentencing of these two men is very, very important to us all, to put it mildly. Though the coverage is small, of course, the word on this is going to spread.<br>
From the very beginning this was all about the, what I refer to as, Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan demonizing dissent, and pathologizing opposition.  Now they are just taking the next steps; Criminalizing and Imprisoning.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t go unanswered; what comes around goes around.</p>

<p>It certainly does depend.  It&rsquo;s always very selective, and very political.  Without a doubt, if somepone from, let&rsquo;s say Iran, were to flee here protesting persecution on speech grounds, they would be received with lavish sympathy. No way would they we sent back.</p>

		<p>Great Britain is simply no longer a free country. In Victorian times one couldn&rsquo;t discuss sex. In today&rsquo;s Britain it is the issue of race. I was immediately taken by the fact there was no place to leave a comment on any of this in the British stories.</p>

		<p>Very strong words against hate from the British government. If hate is so bad why wont they raise a peep about very real racial stabbings and murders?</p>
<p>Why is the word hate always and only used in regards to whites? It&rsquo;s gone on so long they&rsquo;re almost using the word &#8216;hate&rsquo; as if it is a noun. &#8216;These folks are the embodiment of hate&rsquo; seems to be the message. And hate needs to be punished.</p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s left to do is literally stone them for their arrogance and hate. The British government isn&rsquo;t going to have to look far for the crowd. </p>

<p>The name of that Police Unit does have that &#8220;Twilight Zone&#8221; or &#8220;1984&#8221; ring to it. </p>
<p>I wonder if anyone in Britain saw the Movie, &#8220;V&#8221; for Vendetta? </p>
<p>Or, for that matter, the original &#8220;Robin Hood&#8221; with Errol Flynn?</p>
<p>There is a video that Readers here should watch. It is, &#8220;Enoch Powell and His Rivers of Blood Speech&#8221;. This is a speech, filmed many years ago, as Britain was seeing the first real influx of Third Wolders onto its shores.</p>

		<p>The imprisonment of innocent people for expressing their honest views on mass immigration from the third world and destructive policies of multiculturalism has not gone unnoticed by the people of the UK and indeed the entire western world. There will be blowback as an increasing number of people come to the realization that the white race is in a war for its very survival. This is genocide on a massive scale, implemented by a hostile tyrannical state, using not the sword, at least not yet, but wholesale dispossession of its people through mass immigration. As anger builds, the war of survival will accelerate leading to the overthrough of a treasonous and commonly alien elite who are waging a war against the European peoples.      </p>

		<p>So, now Great Britain has no freedom of speech (we&rsquo;ve seen THAT coming), and The U.S. now will not protect freedom of speech.  So, that is just one more step in the wrong direction.  What hope do we as citizens have when we speak out?   </p>
<p>Thank God, there are still people here on both sides of the political spectrum who WILL speak out.  And I hope others will realize before all our freedoms are taken away, that compromising on even one freedom, is putting all of them in jeopardy</p>

		<p>These two are not criminal, but political prisoners.  1984 has arrived in Britain, but in a way George Orwell would never have imagined.  But the real fright is that America assisted this socialist nightmare in its crime against the people.</p>
<p>The government of the UK must be held responsible for allowing through idiotic immigration policies and quotas, indigenous British citizens to be victims of the governments policy.  </p>
<p>Now, hunt me down and extradite me to London - a man who has no criminal record, always obeyed the laws, etc.  Make an example of me as one of the international instigators standing against UK, EU and International corporate government - which owns the US government.</p>
<p>A local man here just got hunted down by a SWAT team in the middle of the night - on my quiet suburban neighborhood in front of my home - for stealing perscription medicine from a local pharmacy because he couldn&rsquo;t afford what he required to survive.  A White man in his late 40s.  Meanwhile, hundreds of illegal immigrants sign up for free care every week in America.</p>
<p>When will this insanity end?</p>

		<p>What makes this case so incredible, is the non-reaction to the prosecution of Simon and Whittle by those who supposedly represent American laws and ideals. Fellow Am Ren readers, the &#8220;far left&#8221; is in firm control of this nation and this case more than any other, except maybe the coming election of Sotomayer, absolutely proves it. Their total disregard for Constitutional principles is manifest in every thing they do. Americans should be afraid, really scared. Those two men should have, at the very least, never been jailed. It&rsquo;s insane.</p>

		<p>Oh, but that Obama who comes from a mass-murdering and racist father who ran with Jomo Kenyatta who raped, butchered, and cannibalized, thousands of whites in South Africa and all the way to Kenya can get asylum and become president and then give third-world terrorist asylum on our soil, but a few pro-white comrades who spoke their God given right to voice their opinions cannot. This reminds me of this past 4th of July where on our local news here in Washington they bragged about how new asylum seekers got their citizenship to be an good ole&rsquo; &#8220;American&#8221; and they should pictures with their precious hands of their heart and every last one of them where non-white from every ethnicity you can think of except &#8220;White-European&#8221;.</p>
<p>This truly sickens my stomach and shows America is now a dictatorship and no longer free but for the politically-correct!!!</p>

		<p>The whole thing is a perverse joke, on so many fronts.<br>
Their premise is that if people read this they will go on a kill-crazy rampage. <br>
Read and go on a rampage??? <br>
How would that explain Black on White crime?<br>
This is, of course, part Projection part Confession. <br>
Meaning this is how The Leviathan operates, not Whites.<br>
They are constantly and deliberately inciting violence against Whites through every aspect of the Media. We were even witness to the pathetically childish reaction of the snickering Obama during his inauguration when the Pastor made that corny and stupid joke about when White does what&rsquo;s right. <br>
Plus, today on Facebook I saw a contact of mine had Obama as a link of some kind.  The Official Obama Facebook thing; and it has &#8220;Women for Obama&#8221; &#8220;African-Americans for Obama&#8221; &#8220;First Americans for Obama&#8221; and on and on.<br>
It couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious which demographic isn&rsquo;t included.<br>
We&rsquo;re not even a demographic to them. The closest they came to &#8220;Whites for Obama&#8221; was the &#8220;Students for Obama&#8221;.  <br>
I do not see how any sensible White person could miss the obvious snub. But we&rsquo;re not talking about sensible people here.</p>
<p>Still, I will say it again; the Leviathan is not going to make it.<br>
I have just spent the last two days traveling the world via the web; I have watched all the Gerald Celente videos, the Jim Rogers videos, read dozens of articles from dozens of sites, and did my usual thing with whatever I could get my hands on relating to Cultural History and Human Behavior (used books for those two). <br>
And I am happy to report that, what I refer to as the Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan is literally weezing and puffing and breathing its last breath.  What will follow won&rsquo;t be pretty.<br>
The Money Power today looks at the States as a valuable piece of Real Estate and they look at the people as a dead population that is taking up space and have to be removed.<br>
Theoretically Seccession seems the right thing. But, aside from the fact that it would be a practical and logistical nightmare, the Will of the people is just not there. As far as I can tell the ONLY thing that will help is hitting bottom; but even that comes with lots of conditions, and no gauruntee. </p>

		<p>   The United States refused to give these two asylum, but would give it to anybody else. How is this country any different from the Islamic countries? Political correctness is just a new way of practicing censorship and communism. The U.S. has become something I don&rsquo;t recognize anymore. This is truly sad. I always thought the communists would come at us full throttle. But no, they just keep sneaking in the back door, like the cowards they truly are. All of us are to blame for it getting this bad. We didn&rsquo;t try to stop it. Farewell United States, it was nice while it lasted. Woe to those of us whom seek freedom. </p>

		<p>The British politicians live in mortal fear of citizens who evangelize the truth and this is why they are criminalizing the right of free speech.  Our British brothers are going to have to accept the fact that in order to eradicate their Marxist politicians they will have to get their hands dirty and possibly wrinkle their three piece suits&hellip;</p>

<p>Ironically we in the West are successfully pushing for Internet freedom in Iran.<br>

<p>The US is the last semi-free country in the world. That is in the process of being corrected by the Alinskyites, of course. I fully expect to do jail time before I&rsquo;m through. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be one of the 25 million Bills Ayers contemplated exterminating.</p>

		<p>That, said Adil Khan, head of diversity and community cohesion at Humberside Police, makes their conviction a first.<br>
&ldquo;This case is groundbreaking,&rdquo; he said.<br>
&ldquo;Inciting racial hatred is a crime and one which seems to occur too regularly. This kind of material will not be tolerated as this lengthy investigation shows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  In my opinion almost everyone who has ever made a posting on AR could be potentially liable to criminal conviction under the same British Law. Could that be why the Obama administration is rushing through &#8220;hate crime&#8221; legislation? Our first Amendment is barely holding on. </p>

<p>&#8220;Quote:&ldquo;Judge Rodney Grant told the men their material was &lsquo;abusive and insulting&rsquo; and had the potential to cause &ldquo;grave social harm&rdquo;. Actually, which is causing the greater &ldquo;social harm&rdquo;, indigenous whites speaking out against the importation of more and more third world trash into the UK or the PRESENCE of more and more third world trash in the UK?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for being more concise than I usually am&hellip;  </p>
<p>But this again illustrates that the UK and our own government, as well as many other Western governments are failing in their primary repsonsibility to protect their civilian populations.  They must be held responsible.</p>
<p>And it is happening because there is this &#8220;unholy&#8221; marriage between the international industrialists (capitalists) and international socialists.  They are both getting what they want right now. I just wonder what will happen when conditions change and they again face off?  </p>
<p>I think the conditions for this face off are shaping up daily.<br>

		<p>Indeed there seems an effort to dismantle the white identity and demonize the memory of it. I propose we take the highest road available&hellip;let the Cains of this worlds strike our faces (figuratively) and turn to them the other sides&hellip; yet let them not reduce us to their animal motivations and jealousy&rsquo;s. Foolish whites will squander and lose their white genetics believing themselves open, kind and progressive..let them,.. its their prerogative. The dignified whites harboring hatred for none but simply seeing the obvious value of preserving their white heritage will not be fooled by flawed idealogy&rsquo;s tempting them to squander their hard won inheritance. Peace to all&hellip;let Gods truth prevail.</p>
