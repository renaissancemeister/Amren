			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Express (London), July 29,2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>INDIAN workers could be handed more than 100 jobs at the British Council which will be outsourced to save taxpayer money, it was reported last night.</p>
<p>The council  &mdash;  which promotes British culture and language overseas  &mdash;  will recruit local Indian workers for finance and IT roles.</p>
<p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which funds the body, is exploring similar options, it was also reported. The move by the council  &mdash;  during a recession  &mdash;  has sparked union outrage. It is feared it could become a blueprint for Whitehall.</p>
<p>The Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents civil servants, said the decision was in direct conflict with Gordon Brown&rsquo;s vow of &#8220;British jobs for British people&#8221;. And it is thought to be the first time that the Civil Service, or a quango, has directly exported jobs to save money.</p>
<p>The council said that 500 of its 1,300 British workers would have to go in the next 18 months to save Â£45million.<br>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t think the British people could be subjected to much more after the takeover of their home by muslims, but I guess I was wrong. Perhaps those of us here in the US could team up with them and form our own country. Then we could make the rules who comes in. Beginning to sound good about now. We need to escape before the Government Run Health Care Plan is forced on us here. The Brits already know how that works - or doesn&rsquo;t work. God help us all. Glad I didn&rsquo;t vote for him.</p>

		<p>I can think of an even better way to save taxpayer money - deport some of the dole blodgers who have sneaked into the country. Interesting, the BNP was not only opposed parasitic immigration but also supports British jobs for British workers. And unlike Labor, they would have tried to keep their promises.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not to save &#8220;taxpayer money&#8221;, it&rsquo;s to get cheaper labor. How is it going to save taxpayer money when one lays off the natives, they will be out of work and won&rsquo;t be paying taxes?</p>

<p>What?  Shouldn&rsquo;t the British promote British culture?  And with so many Indians living in England did they really need to go to Inida to give Indians British jobs?  I feel confused.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worse than that.  A few weeks ago, the BNP ran a story about how the Brown government is giving like two million pounds to start India&rsquo;s space program.</p>

<p>Quite a valid observation.  I would say that this illustrates well the truth of the situaiton - which is that the desired results is to impoverish more British in the continued self-flaggellating frenzy that the British society and government seem caught up in to the point of self-extinction.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will set off another Peasant&rsquo;s Revolt (of 1380) and from there it will become a nationalist uprising?  One can only hope for the best outcome - eventually.</p>
