	<blockquote><i>&#8220;The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don&rsquo;t do anything about it.&#8221;<div align="right">  &mdash;  Albert Einstein</div></i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>&#8220;In my own life, in my own small way, I have tried to give back to this country that has given me so much,&#8221; she said. &#8220;See, that&rsquo;s why I left a job at a big law firm for a career in public service.&#8221;<div align="right">  &mdash;  Michelle Obama</div></i></blockquote>
<p>No, Michele Obama does not get paid to serve as the First Lady and she doesn&rsquo;t perform any official duties. But this hasn&rsquo;t deterred her from hiring an unprecedented number of staffers to cater to her every whim and to satisfy her every request in the midst of the Great Recession. Just think Mary Lincoln was taken to task for purchasing china for the White House during the Civil War. And Mamie Eisenhower had to shell out the salary for her personal secretary.</p>
<p>How things have changed! If you&rsquo;re one of the tens of millions of Americans facing certain destitution, earning less than subsistence wages stocking the shelves at Wal-Mart or serving up McDonald cheeseburgers, prepare to scream and then come to realize that the benefit package for these servants of Miz Michele are the same as members of the national security and defense departments and the bill for these assorted lackeys is paid by John Q. Public:</p>
<p>1. $172,2000  &mdash;  Sher, Susan (Chief of Staff)</p>
<p>2. $140,000  &mdash;  Frye, Jocelyn C. (Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Policy and Projects for the First Lady)</p>
<p>3. $113,000  &mdash;  Rogers, Desiree G. (Special Assistant to the President and White House Social Secretary)</p>
<p>4. $102,000  &mdash;  Johnston, Camille Y. (Special Assistant to the President and Director of Communications for the First Lady)</p>
<p>5. Winter, Melissa E. (Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff to the First Lady)</p>
<p>6. $90,000  &mdash;  Medina, David S. (Deputy Chief of Staff to the First Lady)</p>
<p>7. $84,000  &mdash;  Lelyveld, Catherine M. (Director and Press Secretary to the First Lady)</p>
<p>8. $75,000  &mdash;  Starkey, Frances M. (Director of Scheduling and Advance for the First Lady)</p>
<p>9. $70,000  &mdash;  Sanders, Trooper (Deputy Director of Policy and Projects for the First Lady)</p>
<p>10. $65,000  &mdash;  Burnough, Erinn J. (Deputy Director and Deputy Social Secretary)</p>
<p>11. Reinstein, Joseph B. (Deputy Director and Deputy Social Secretary)</p>
<p>12. $62,000  &mdash;  Goodman, Jennifer R. (Deputy Director of Scheduling and Events Coordinator for the First Lady)</p>
<p>13. $60,000  &mdash;  Fitts, Alan O. (Deputy Director of Advance and Trip Director for the First Lady)</p>
<p>14. Lewis, Dana M. (Special Assistant and Personal Aide to the First Lady)</p>
<p>15. $52,500  &mdash;  Mustaphi, Semonti M. (Associate Director and Deputy Press Secretary to the First Lady)</p>
<p>16. $50,000  &mdash;  Jarvis, Kristen E. (Special Assistant for Scheduling and Traveling Aide to the First Lady)</p>

		<p>The commentary regarding the so - called «First Lady&rsquo;s» extensive (and redundant), «staff» remind me of the appalling wife of the late (I believe he may be dead, I am not sure), «Baby - Doc» Duvalier, son of the late «Papa Doc» Duvalier, who, against almost all odds, managed to increase the degree of havoc and misery that has plaguesd that benighted Caribbean «nation» on the east side of the former Isle of Dominica.</p>
<p>  When hundreds and thousands of Haitians were, literally, dying of hunder, malnutrition and disease,  and were «housed» in conditions at which even an Bombay begger would turn up his nose, «Madame» Duvalier, an former West Indian fashion model,  would fly,  with an entourage, to places like New York City,  Paris, and London, and embark on extensive, and expensive, shopping tours. </p>
<p> I believe that, when the US State Department decided that the time had come for the Duvalier&rsquo;s to leave, (they were flown into exile in France),  the US AirForce, or the French air force, had to provide another aircraft to ferry, as cargo, the extensive collection of couture, shoes, furniture, «bric - a brac,» and «accessories» with, for some curious reason, the wives and consorts of Third World dictators, like to adorn and surround themselves.</p>
<p> Also, I recall the media «furore» which occurred when another First Lady - this one being Nancy Reagan, referred to an «crisis» in the White House kitchens. (the «crisis» in this instance being an shortage of spoons, or forks,  required either for coffee or salad).  Were it only thus!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;In my own life, in my own small way, I have tried to give back to this country that has given me so much,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Wow. What a change from &#8220;I&rsquo;ve never been proud of this country before&#8221; and that gem, &#8220;America is a mean country&#8221; when her hubby was campaigning. What&rsquo;s gotten into her? I think a lot of blacks had an epiphany when Obama was elected. Our local paper quoted a black citizen the day after the election. He said, &#8221; I can&rsquo;t believe we elected a black president. And WHITE people did that!&#8221; Yeah, this is a pretty good country, Michelle. You&rsquo;re lucky to be a part of it. And White people are no longer &#8220;the Enemy&#8221; that are causing all your people&rsquo;s problems. As for the &#8220;twenty attendants&#8221;, how many attendants did other first ladies have? Just curious. You need help if you are going to be an active First Lady. I&rsquo;m definitely in favor of her going to speak to little black ghetto girls and trying to impress upon them the necessity of getting educated, reading, not having illegitimate children, etc, etc, because God knows, they sure aren&rsquo;t getting that message from their mothers and &#8220;baby daddies&#8221;. <br>

		<p>The utter arrogance of this women is amusing and sickening at the same time. Affirmative action always, ALWAYS, leaves its beneficiaries with an attitude of entitlement. &#8220;THEY&#8221; are owned something by the &#8220;OTHER.&#8221; It reminds me of the song, &#8220;nice work if you can get it&#8221;,etc.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As for the &ldquo;twenty attendants&rdquo;, how many attendants did other first ladies have?&#8221;</p>
<p>The highest number of attendants given to a first lady was 28, under Betty Ford. Laura Bush had 14, so a rise to 20 in the midst of a recession is a quite a despicable choice. At a time when Elizabeth II is scaling back her travel plans and putting off renovations to Buckingham Palace and the Queen of Spain is flying commercial, Michelle Obama gets to wander around in luxury. Seriously, does she deserve to be treated better than Royalty?</p>

		<p>I dreamed last night, due to the financial disaster in which our country finds itself, that Congress took a pay cut - half their salary - for the duration and no perks. Then, the first lady cut her staff to two assistants, and the President gave his salary up entirely and is only depending on the kindness of strangers to keep him in blackberries. CEOs of AIG and other large companies will take no bonuses and illegal aliens will all go home giving us a net gain of billions of dollars. Next, h  &mdash;  - freezes over!</p>

		<p>Poster #1 quite correctly referred to her as the &#8220;so-called First Lady&#8221; which is stating thed matter correctly. There is no such offical title or position as First Lady. It is purely a creation of the press. She is not an employee of the government, appointed or elected. That phony title has always annoyed me   &mdash;   now even more so. No does the USA have any such thing as a &#8220;First Family&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s an attempt to create an approximation to royalty, something we don&rsquo;t need or want. It is un-American.  Mrs. Obama is only the spouse of an elected official, that&rsquo;s all.  In short, there is no such thing.</p>

		<p>That &#8216;career in public service&rsquo; that Madame Obama refers to -</p>
<p>Would that be the $300,000, mostly no-show job she suddenly had when her husband, Barrack Obama, became a Illinois State Senator,and directed millions in state funds to her employer, the University of Chicago Hospitals? </p>
<p>Would that be the same job that suddenly disappeared, never to be filled, when Obama became President? </p>
<p>Is that the public service job she&rsquo;s referring to? </p>

How are you going to feel when you loose your job/pension/investments/home?  That is guaranteed under the Republicans who expect the system to &#8220;correct itself.&#8221;  Just hilarious&hellip;..  but not funny at all.</p>

		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of George W. Bush, but he and Laura left the Whitehouse and returned to private life, and seem to have scaled back their lifestyles without any personal trauma.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see Barack and Michelle being able to leave the limelight voluntarily, EVER, nor do I see them being happy about giving up Air Force One, the huge staff, the all-expense paid luxury travel, the White House press corps, etc.  They&rsquo;ll be able to write their memoirs and make money, and no doubt go on speaking tours, but they are on TV so much at this point that they may well be overexposed by the time they leave office.  I know that after six months I am dead-flat tired of seeing him on TV every time I turn it on.</p>
<p>If Barack&rsquo;s presidency is seen as a failure (as Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s presidency was by the time he left office) or if it is proven at some point that Barack is a lying, fraudster of an illegal alien, then they may not even be able to make big money on the lecture circuit.  </p>
<p>In any event, I don&rsquo;t see these two being able to scale back to a quiet, private life.</p>

		<p>No matter how much we know of the corruption of elected officials and their spouses, we have not the power to stop them. Because secret cabals rule this nation behind the curtain, including the &#8220;fed&#8221; moneychangers/warmongers, we have no access to power. The lawyers inside and outside Congress are answerable to those cabals and will do nothing to bring our legal system back on the track of defending our Rights as Sovereign Citizens. The Sovereignty has been switched to the secret powers and Americans suffer as a result. So what can be done for us? Apparently nothing. We must await the next dastardly deed by the black ops, and react as always. Sad. Sad.</p>

 <br>
One job title with some other Hussein appointments tweaked my curiosity though, &#8216;Corey Ealons, Director of African American Media and Coordinator of Special Projects.&rsquo;<br>
http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-More-Key-White-House-Staff/<br>
(Check out how many media spinners there are.)</p>
<p>Is this a usual job for all administrations? Or just for this &#8216;special&rsquo; administration?<br>
I can understand the need for a &#8216;Director of Hispanic Media&rsquo; as they have their own language, but the other?<br>
What does he do? Record for prosperity &#8220;this is the first time a African American president has ever &hellip;(blown his nose etc.)&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe he shares little tidbits of information like Hussein and M.Obama&rsquo;s first date was to see Spike Lee&rsquo;s &#8220;do the right thing&#8221;. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/adksa7" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/adksa7</a> (no.28)<br>
Or what Hussein like to listen to on his iPod.</p>
<p>Finally there&rsquo;s this funny little article, that is curious to why they have to go back 50 yrs to find a comparison for this first lady in Jackie O, when they say the only thing they have in common is that they are mannequin like clothes horse&rsquo;s.<br>
Where a more appropriate comparison would be Hilary Clinton.<br>

<p>I wonder if the new black Disney princess will have a protruding jawbone and be 5&rsquo;11?</p>

		<p>She isn&rsquo;t giving anything at all back to this country; the princely salaries of this horde of do-nothing &#8220;attendants&#8221; are paid with our tax money, while we endure layoffs and pay cuts.</p>
<p>The oblivious pretense by this dim-witted America-hater that she is &#8220;giving something back&#8221; is akin to Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s 1789 suggestion that hungry French peasants &#8220;eat cake&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet dollars to donuts the vast majority of these assistants are black with a few white tokens thrown in so it doesn&rsquo;t look too suspicious.  Mz. Obama appears to be somewhat of a narcissist and very vain.  </p>
<p>I never thought a husband and wife team of black supremacists could ascend to the presidency.  Oh, and from what we know it appears our black attorney general is also a black supremacist. But as they say&hellip;.only in America.      </p>
