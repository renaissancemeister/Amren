			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Kravitz, Indianapolis Star, July 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In Indiana, and in many other parts of the NBA-watching world, it&rsquo;s the giant white elephant in the middle of the room.</p>
<p><em>Is Pacers president Larry Bird specifically trying to build a team dominated by white players?</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an uncomfortable question to ask in these politically correct days, but how do you ignore a roster that includes Mike Dunleavy, Troy Murphy, Josh McRoberts, Travis Diener, Jeff Foster and now, first-round pick Tyler Hansbrough?</p>
<p>In a league where little more than 10 percent of the players are white Americans, the Pacers roster is racially split down the middle, making them one of the whitest teams in the league.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see race at all,&#8221; Bird said recently. &#8220;I know a lot of it comes out of the brawl (in 2004 at Detroit), people think Indiana has to get all white guys, but I don&rsquo;t buy any of that. I played in Boston, where it didn&rsquo;t matter who came in or who left, it was who helped us win. (Late Celtics coach and architect) Red (Auerbach) never saw color. And I don&rsquo;t, either. I just pick them. If we hadn&rsquo;t taken Tyler Hansbrough, it would have been Ty Lawson. And if I could have gotten another pick (later in the first round), I would have taken Sam Young or Wayne Ellington.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is the perception, fueled in part by local and national sports talk shows, that because the Pacers imploded after the brawl and had several other off-court embarrassments that involved a select few black players, they&rsquo;re overcompensating by stocking the roster with white players they perceive (and their fans perceive) to be choirboys. This overlooks the fact that since Bird got involved in the draft process, eight of the 10 Pacers draftees have been black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In some ways, the Pacers president is still held hostage by some of the comments he made to Jim Gray in a 2004 ESPN roundtable discussion. Asked if the NBA would benefit from having more white stars (specifically white American stars), Bird answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think so. I think so. You know when I played you had me and Kevin (McHale) and some others throughout the league. I think it&rsquo;s good for a fan base because, as we all know, the majority of the fans are white America. And if you just had a couple of white guys in there, you might get them a little excited &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>How is that different than saying that Major League Baseball needs more black stars? Or that the NBA needed a Chinese-born star to open that huge market?</p>

		<p>I remember when Larry was the best in the NBA, how many blacks dumped on the Celtics. Magic Johnson was a very good player, but much of his popularity comes from the fact that he was the Black Opponent of Larry Bird in the playoffs. </p>
<p>In fact, the influx of talented Europeans into the NBA means the beginning of the end for at least the unintelligent blacks in the league. Europeans know strategy and play a team game. The Western Conference, while primarily black, has more white players and unquestionably is superior to the &#8216;physical&rsquo; but inferior nearly all-black Eastern Conference. </p>
<p>There would be more whites in the NBA, from Europe if not America, if not for a biased media starting with Disney&rsquo;s ESPN and going down to the newspapers terrified of being called &#8220;racist&#8221; if they demand more talented and intelligent white players.</p>

		<p>As almost always, it not a matter of Black or White, but of green. If the Pacers start winning games, then this criticism will evaporate. If the White players turn out to be hacks, then the same bricks will begin dropping that drop on any losing team and its leadership.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like whenever a Black coach complains about being the first fired. You don&rsquo;t hear these complaints from those who win. </p>

		<p>So, the Pacers are the only team in the NBA where blacks and whites are equally represented and THEY are the ones accused of being &#8220;racist?&#8221;  Bird makes a good point - the NBA would benefit financially from more white players.  I find it ironic that white sports like NHL and NASCAR are always trying to bring in more minorities to increase their fan base yet it is considered racist for a &#8220;black&#8221; sport like the NBA to try to bring in more whites to increase its fan base.</p>

		<p>But you can&rsquo;t take race out of it.  Why are we to assume that white basketball isn&rsquo;t good?  I think Larry Bird is looking for versions of himself for the pacers, i.e. guys who are mostly white who are versed in the fundamentals of the game.  Not street ball, slam-jamming, hanging off the rim, jumping high, and being ostentatious for the ESPN highlight reel.</p>

		<p> If Bob Kravitz REALLY thinks that &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t matter,&#8221; then he&rsquo;s definitely all mixed up. Of course race matters. Larry Bird as much as acknowledged that in his statement about how more White players would translate into a bigger gate.</p>
<p> There are I don&rsquo;t know how many friends of mine who have told me they no longer watch NBA games because of the all-black nature of most teams. In basketball-mad Indiana (I&rsquo;m a life-long Hoosier, by the way), if the Pacers want to recruit heavily among the good ole&rsquo; boys (and no, they&rsquo;re not choirboys, either) then more power to them. The mainstream media can talk all they want to about how gosh-awful talented these blacks are, but I say, scratch a black athlete, find a thug. </p>

		<p>I sometimes ask myself: &#8220;Do these critics ever realise the stupidity of their criticism?&#8221; The obvious answer is no. Having an almost all-black team is OK by them, but God forbid if any other variation is taken.</p>

<p>Uh&hellip; isn&rsquo;t it obvious?  The baseball matter is different because &#8220;the majority of the fans are white America&#8221;. Weren&rsquo;t you paying attention, Bob Kravitz, or did your own agenda blind you?  Whereas if Yao Ming opened up a new Chinese market for the NBA, then there is no difference, it&rsquo;s the same principle, and just as true.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe they&rsquo;re making this argument with a straight face. All I can say is that there is an easy way for the Pacers to settle this&hellip; on the court, baby. Now, the real question is whether or not the other teams will be embarrassed enough by losing to a white team to actually stop discriminating and get some white talent of their own.</p>

		<p>I think this is only a taste of what is coming in this country, and any currently white majority in this world. Blacks dominate this league. They makeup over 80% of the players, despite being only 13% or so percent on the American populace. The fact that there are ANY white players in the NBA is &#8220;too many white folks&#8221; for some. Blacks will never be satisfied with race relations until there are little to no white people left.</p>

		<p>Larry Bird is one of the best basketball players to ever play the game.  Larry Bird is correct and I support him 100%.  I don&rsquo;t know if this is fair or not but any white player playing in the NBA will be judged by what Larry Bird did on the court.  Besides Michael Jordan, pound for pound, Larry Bird is one of the greatest.  He proved that whites could play the game of basketball and not be great jumpers or runners.  Larry Bird could score anywhere on the court and no one will every match him for his mental toughness.  I&rsquo;m black American and I love attending the New Oreans Hornets basketball games.  I wish the NBA would stop filling their roster what European white players and start drafting more white American players.  I love my country and I do not feel that blacks are any better athletes than whites.</p>

		<p>The objection to the building of an almost all-White Team bothers many Blacks, the NAACP, and many Sports Announcers. </p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the All Black Teams of the Chicago Bulls, and New York Knicks bother them, as well? </p>
<p>So Blacks can make up the Majority, or the enirety of a Team, but the same is not allowed for Whites, because it would be Racist. I see. It goes back to the &#8220;We can, but you can&rsquo;t syndrome. I am way past the point of putting up with that nonsense. </p>
<p>I used to follow the Boston Celtics all the time, in the 1980s with Larry Byrd, and Kevin McHale, on the Team. It was great to see a passing game. A game of Team play, not simply one guy hogging the ball, and racing it to the net, and then jumping four feet in the air, to finally slam the ball into the hoop.<br>
Then for a finish, they would swing on the hoop like it was the Monkey Bars.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know ant Whites who watch Basketball. What&rsquo;s the point? </p>
<p>I can see all of that action, including the fights, at any Inner City Court. </p>

<p>There is a difference. Quite a large difference. The difference being whites are greatly underrepresented in the NBA while blacks are not underrepresented in MLB. They&rsquo;re a bit overrepresented in baseball. </p>

		<p>Once again, a brilliant illustration of the race hustle in America for all to see&hellip;if they have eyes to see. That a league wherein only ten percent of the players are White(despite being 2/3&rsquo;s of the population) can find fault with a few too many Whites in one spot, is a mind-boggling naked example of just how disingenuous and pernicious all this &#8220;diversity,equality,etc.&#8221; nonsense really is! </p>

		<p>Most of the media in America operates under a theory that if you insert racism into the news, that it will sell, like CNN, who seem obsessed w/racism, or their perception of it, has anyone checked the racial makeup of ESPN lately, looks like an overdose of Affirmative Action, using rapper thugs as commentators.</p>

		<p>Is anybody here but me aware of the fact that Olympic teams from white countries were beating our all black college teams, so the big bully USA used its influence and invoked the use of  paid professionals, something that is an absolute illegality according to the rules and against the very spirit of the olympics?  The leftist media called these pros, who had a hundred times the experience of the the teams from other countries, the &#8220;Dream Team,&#8221; instead of being ashamed that this country used them.</p>
<p>I wonder where the decision and influence came from to create an all pro team?  Alleging the white teams from other countries were the same as &#8220;pros&#8221; was nothing but a despicable lie.  They didn&rsquo;t have any more experience than the college players here in this country, no matter how long they played together.  Ability wins games, not familiararity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who was responsible, but I do know the reason for it was because whites were beating nearly all black US teams and people were beginning to wonder why we couldn&rsquo;t get more whites on our basketball teams since whites performed so well in other countries.  The answer, of course, was rooted in a black bias by the US media and US officials who were looking stupid for insisting on their all black teams everywhere, backed up by a behind the scenes element in this country that works dilligently to neutralize the whie power base any way it can.</p>
<p>The last laugh is on them, however, because the multimillion dollar professional blacks are being beaten at times by white amateurs.</p>
<p>But, you know what?  Like a couple of the above posters, I don&rsquo;t watch any kind of sports any more.  None.  Zip.  Nada.  And it&rsquo;s been that way for quite a while, so I guess I should quit worrying about the whole affair and wait until this entire multiracial pig sty implodes.  And, it will.</p>

		<p>Considering how Bird and his &#8220;white&#8221; Celtics did in the 1980&rsquo;s against basically all-black teams (most of which spent more money on talent than Boston) you would think Pacers fans would be glad. I suspect most of them are actually. The &#8216;complaints&rsquo; are more media generated anti-white garbage. The media will always quote or cite black &#8216;fans&rsquo;, the mysterious &#8216;some fans&rsquo; whom you never see, and of course &#8216;sources&rsquo;. They might dig up a disgruntled &#8216;white&rsquo; fan here or there. You can bet that &#8216;fan&rsquo; will most likely be a friend or relative of some news producer etc. </p>

		<p>Ranger #25&#8221; Yes, I remember that White Olympic Teams were devastating all Black American Teams. Even after the NBA Pros made up those &#8220;Dream Teams&#8221;, they were getting their heads handed to them,too. </p>
<p>Since when are Professional Athletes competing in the Olympics, in keeping with the Spirit of the Games?</p>
<p>We used to complain quite loudly about how the Russian Army Team was used in the &#8220;Amateur&#8221; Competitions, since everyone knew that the Russian Team ONLY PLAYED HOCKEY. This is all they did. </p>
<p>I remember watching the U.S.A. Olympic Hockey Team destroy its competition, which included the stunned Russians, in 1980. They ended the next day with a tie with Finland, and took the Gold Medal. What a thrill. That was Sport. </p>

		<p>Part of it is do to the native abilities of blacks but more is because of the harassment of white players once they have hit minority status. It&rsquo;s the same reason construction crews go all Hispanic. If you are the only white guy, expect to have an &ldquo;accident�?.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t whites just form their own leagues (again)? It&rsquo;s illegal, of course. When blacks were kept out of white leagues, they were free to form their own. The same right should be given to whites.</p>
<p>Whites are much more &ldquo;team players�? and would do very well against black leagues where dunking and show-boating are the norms. European teams prove this.</p>

		<p>Geez, why not?   In basketball you make the team by taking a test (nominally called a tryout) where your physical prowess and size may be very influential,but your race or cultural background not so much.  Let&rsquo;s try that same scheme in other trades and professions where the test is physical or written or both but capable of determining performance on the job.</p>
<p>Now in sports the outcome of the tryout is, more often than not, very racially disprate but by and large we accept the efficacy of the test to determine the best candidate.  In other trades and professions the best intellect will likely also be the best candidate for the subject job and similarily we may predict that the results will be very racially disparate!  Do you suppose all races can come to accept disparate results whether the testing measures physical prowess or intellectual prowess??</p>

		<p>Anyone remember the NFL and so many people said that Mark Sanchez was a perfect fit for the Jets one of the major reasons they gave was that there was a large Hispanic market in NY that could be tapped in to if the Jets had a Hispanic quarterback?  The unstated but implied point was that Hispanics would be more interested in watching football if the star of the game (Almost always the QB) was Hispanic.  In fact if anyone here is a football fan then you are familiar with the fact that the start of the NFL season coincides with &#8220;Hispanic heritage month&#8221; here in the USA, and we have to endure ad after NFL ad &#8220;celebrating Hispanic heritage&#8221;.</p>
<p>So help me understand this:</p>
<p>MLB &#8220;suffers&#8221; from too few black players - so any team that has &#8220;too many&#8221; black players should be suspected of racism?</p>
<p>Oh wait, sorry, I got my sports and my races confused, let me correct:</p>
<p>The NBA &#8220;is diverse&#8221; and doesn&rsquo;t have many white players, so any team that has &#8220;too many&#8221; white players is a suspect of racist policies - gotcha.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and Larry Bird said he was insulted when a white guy was guarding him - funny so few people complained about that statement.  And again, oh yeah, 80% of the players drafted under Larry Birds rule are African-Americans - how racist (I&rsquo;ll let the reader decide for themselves exactly which race is being discriminated against in that statement).</p>

		<p>People still watch the NBA? I stopped watching the minute the league became more concerned with ratings and pushing the large market teams. What the league should do is make sure that the game is played correctly and stop all the palming and travelling that today&rsquo;s &#8220;superstars&#8221; get away with. </p>
<p>Color of the players has never mattered to me  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s how you play the game. As a fan of the Sixers growing up, I loved Dr. J and Bobby Jones. I loved watching Pete Maravich play. </p>
<p>I always like Bird&rsquo;s ability to not only be such a good scorer, but he would throw some amazing passes to his team mates. Even though as a Sixer fan I hated Boston because they were in our division. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that color has become an issue in what really is a child&rsquo;s game. But this world is obsessed with race, so I shouldn&rsquo;t be suprised.</p>

		<p>They still play basketball? I wouldn&rsquo;t know. Professional sports have diversified themselves right out of my life. It is also the primary reason for the surge in interest in NASCAR, as the last &#8216;white&rsquo; sport.</p>

		<p>Equality means that all sporting teams and all professions must be dominated by blacks and other minorities.  If there&rsquo;s a case of  whites comprising a meager 40-50% in a given profession or sport  then the usual suspects scream racism. Incidentally, Tyler Hansbrough was the best college basketball player in 2008-09 but that&rsquo;s conveniently overlooked.    </p>
<p>In a country that prides itself on equality of opportunity I fail to see how that right is being extended when black males comprise 6% of the population yet the ratio of blacks to whites in the NBA is roughly 85/15. Perhaps Sotomayor will use her clout as U.S. Supreme Court justice to redress this grave injustice and see to it that the NBA opens doors to white players.    </p>
