<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8169285.stm">Points Bonus for Scots Immigrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, July 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrants who choose to live and work in Scotland could earn British citizenship more readily, according to Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy.</p>
<p>Writing in Scotland on Sunday, he says moving to Scotland could see immigrants earn points towards their application.</p>
<p>Points are granted according to things like skills, age and potential salary.</p>
<p>Mr Murphy said he wants to see Scotland become a melting pot  &mdash;  but he stressed new arrivals must be controlled under a tight immigration policy.</p>
<p>There is to be a consultation process on the proposal, but in his article Mr Murphy writes of the demographic challenge facing Scotland, with an ageing population and the need to recruit in sectors such as tourism.</p>
<p>The article says a new &#8220;points-based&#8221; test for citizenship will credit applicants if they have set up home in parts of the country in need of increased population.</p>
<p>Scotland has been singled out by the Home Office as a place where points could be earned, because its own population is likely to fall over the long term.</p>
<p>Mr Murphy wrote: &#8220;Our need for a growing population is ranked along with the need to recruit to shortage occupations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current system means foreigners can apply for British citizenship on the basis they are settled and have lived in the country for a specified period of time.<br>

		<p><i>.Mr Murphy said <b>he wants to see Scotland become a melting pot</b> &mdash; but he stressed <b>new arrivals must be controlled under a tight immigration policy</b>.</i></p>
<p>Direct contradiction there.</p>
<p><i>Mr Murphy wrote: &ldquo;Our need for a growing population is ranked along with the need to recruit to shortage occupations.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Please excuse the capitalisation of the following sentence, but I must express my complete and utter confusion:<br>
WHERE ARE THE SELF-PROCLAIMED &#8220;ENVIRONMENTALISTS!</p>
<p>There is clear evidence that Mr. Murphy and his cronies want the Scottish population <i>to <b>increase</b></i> and support the economic Ponzi scheme of &#8220;ageing population - more immigration - immigrants become elderly - <i>more</i> immigration - those immigrants become elderly - <i>even more</i> immigration&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;yet nary a peep from the mostly-white liberals who want to &#8220;preserve the environment&#8221;, &#8220;stabilise or reduce the human population&#8221; and &#8220;move towards greater sustainability&#8221;.</p>
<p>Do they believe that non-white immigrants from overpopulated nations on the verge of environmental collapse will care more about the Scottish environment and sustainability than the natives, that they&rsquo;ll have less children than the natives?</p>
<p>Or does the cowardly fear of being decried a &#8220;racist&#8221; trump their supposed &#8220;environmentalist&#8221; beliefs?</p>

		<p>The ignorance of Britain&rsquo;s New Labour Party is beyond belief.<br>
 Yes, it&rsquo;s afact that outside of Scotland&rsquo;s &#8216;central valley&rsquo; area (ie Glasgow and Edinburgh), that the country is very under-populated.<br>
  But surely they must know the reason for this, for centuries thousands and thousands of emigrants have poured out of the highlads and islands to all corners of the globe - if they never left than Scotland wouldn&rsquo;t be underpopulated.<br>
  They left simply because there is very little work to be had in the remoter parts of Scotland.</p>

This incredible self-destructive behavior is getting worse among White people, as they strive to be politically-correct most don&rsquo;t have any realization that they are helping to destroy our race.</p>

		<p>Obscuratus,</p>
<p>             They are not scarred of being called racists but their desire to see Whites race-replaced is greater than their concern for the environment. Indeed most leftists do not care about the environment as the biggest threat to the natural non-human world is the growing population of backward peoples around the world. Any true environmentalist would push for third world nations reducing their populations. Environmentalism is only used to weaken the nations of the west.</p>
<p>   On a different note, our ruling elites are either fools living in a wonderland or hate us with a vengeance. Anybody with eyes can see how mixed race nations like India, Brazil, Bangladesh, Mexico etc&hellip; are doing as compared to homogenous nations like Japan, S. Korea, Finland or Taiwan. Why would anybody in his right mind convert Scotland to a Brazil?<br>

With a recession and high unemployment, Scotland needs no immigrants. What happened to the Scottish Independence movement? I thought the reason to break from England was to preserve the indigenous Scottish people and culture? </p>

<p>Good post, paisan. I, too, have wondered how the multiculturalists-who also are at the forefront of &#8220;going green&#8221;- can posibly reconcile Third World immigration to the West, with maintaining our ecosystem. Are they blind to the fact that Haitians have destroyed 99% of Haiti&rsquo;s forests for wood for cooking; for example? Most Third World people are destructive to their environments in their country of origin. What makes the multiculturalists think the immigrants will suddenly become environmentally conscious?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the same ones who peddle the global-warming garbage and the pap that the wind and sun will provide the world&rsquo;s energy needs. Yeah, right.</p>

		<p>If by &#8220;melting pot&#8221; he meant that white immigrants from eastern Europe would come and adopt Scottish traditions, it would be one thing. But he clearly wants to &#8220;melt&#8221; Scottishness away and replace it with some insane multicultural abomination. I hope Scotts like gang rape, open air cremation and all the over joys of diversity. </p>

		<p>Scotland would not be &#8216;underpopulated&rsquo; at all, if the Highland Clearances had not depopulated the lands judged to be &#8216;overpopulated&rsquo; only a couple of centuries back.  Funny, but those &#8216;worthless&rsquo; people who were shipped off to the colonies virtually built the civilized world.  Last month, here on AMREN, I read that Scots are the third most affluent group in America.  That&rsquo;s saying a lot, since Jews surely occupy one of the top two spots.</p>
<p>How about we repopulate Scotland by offering restitution of land to the descendents of the victims of the clearances?  Those were commonly held lands. They were stolen from the Scottish tribes. But Scotland&rsquo;s nobility deemed sheep to be more profitable than the distant kinsmen they were obliged to protect.</p>
<p>Scots descendents would do as they do here in South Mississippi.  They would plant trees on the land.  Everybody&rsquo;s a winner with forestry.  It&rsquo;s a cash crop that improves the climate.  And trees are far nicer to interact with than are Somalis.</p>
<p>In any event, a falling population is a good thing, not a problem.  More room for trees and wildlife.  Sweden&rsquo;s prosperity is due, in part, to the planting of trees on former farms, after that country was depopulated by Swedes fleeing mistreatment by the aristocracy.  Forestry helped make Sweden rich.  It could do the same for Scotland.  In contrast, Third World immigrants will only be a drain on the economy.</p>

		<p>You want a REAL Melting pot? ALLOW ALL SCOTS, (who are descendants of the White Celts who emigrated from that land hundreds of years ago) who now live ALL OVER THE GLOBE, to be the ONLY emigres allowed for such a &#8216;melting pot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Allow those WHITES to &#8216;return home&rsquo; (a Celtic &#8220;Aliyah&#8221;?) and just SEE how that would TRANSFORM the Scottish nation to one of world-class prominence in less than twenty years.</p>
<p>Why not? is taht not a true melting pot. Do they not come from all over the globe? Would they not like a country for Scots, by Scots, and with Scots?</p>
<p>That would, of course mean, that all non-Scots and non-Whites, and non-Christians would have to leave&hellip;</p>
<p>And how much you bet they wouldn&rsquo;t do it, because they KNOW it would mean Edinburgh would be the Jewel of Europe, if they did! And all the blather over &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; as a &#8216;good thing&rsquo; would be shown the back door&hellip;and they KNOW IT!</p>

<p>none of these countries anywhere should be melting pots. No one else should have to suffer the American nightmare.</p>
<p>Re: #15 &#8220;Anonymous&#8221;:</p>
<p>Eastern Europeans are not Scots!! Why would Scotland wish to undermine its genetic heritage and links to ancestry? Europe isn&rsquo;t yet bastardised like America. Scotland still has a real, living heritage of tens of thousands of years - something that would be lost by mixing with Eastern European aliens.</p>
