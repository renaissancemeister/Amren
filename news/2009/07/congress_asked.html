<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31854789/ns/us_news-military/">Congress Asked to Address Racism In Military</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the country&rsquo;s main monitors of hate groups asked Congress Friday to investigate possible racial extremism in the military, after finding U.S. service members participating in a social networking site advertised as being for white people only.</p>
<p>Researchers from the Southern Poverty Law Center, based in Montgomery, Ala., identified about 40 personal profiles of people who list the military as their occupation on the Web site New Saxon, according to the group&rsquo;s founder, Morris Dees.</p>
<p>The site, run by the Detroit-based National Socialist Movement, describes itself as an &#8220;online community for whites by whites.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Examples that Dees cited from the Web page include:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* One who said he was serving in Afghanistan lists as his favorite book, &#8220;The Turner Diaries.&#8221; The novel is a favorite of white supremacists.</p>
<p>&#8220;We urge your committees to investigate the threat posed by racial extremists who may be serving in the military to ensure that our armed forces are not inadvertently training future domestic terrorists,&#8221; Dees wrote in a letter addressed to four congressional committee chairmen.</p>
<p>Dees said existing Pentagon regulations that prohibit active participation in extremists groups should be strengthened further.</p>
<p>Pentagon: Current policy is adequate</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Les&rsquo; A. Melnyk, a Pentagon spokesman, said in an e-mail that current policy is believed to be sufficient. Under it, military personnel &#8220;must reject&#8221; participation in organizations that espouse supremacist causes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jeff Schoep, commander of the National Socialist Movement, said there are members of the military who participate on the site, but not all are members of his organization. He could not say how many there are.</p>
<p>When violent material is found on the site, Schoep said, it is removed and the offender faces losing future privileges.</p>
<p>He said there are more &#8220;racialists&#8221; in the military now, but those who are members of his organization are advised not to recruit others.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they just mind their P&rsquo;s and Q&rsquo;s in there, and are good soldiers and do their jobs, then they have every right to be there just like anybody else,&#8221; Schoep said.</p>

		<p>Can we assume that Morri$ Dee$ will next investigate ourspace.com, and find black military personel who are openly in street gangs, or members who use it to organize white-beating mobs? Probably not, since the real threat to the U.S.A. is white supremacists. When will they learn that diversity is our greatest strength?</p>

		<p>Oh, Lord, please!  Here they knowingly put these Mexican and black gangs in our military and TRAIN them even more to do us in and the RACIST SPLC is trying to tell us it is the Whites that are a danger?  If only that were true.</p>

		<p>If the SPLC is operating here like I think they usually do, I could imagine that material &#8220;proving&#8221; that bent crossers exist in the Armed Forces is SPLC stooge material.  For instance, an FBI informant takes a picture of another FBI informant wearing &#8220;real&#8221; Army fatigues and bearing &#8220;real&#8221; Army equipment in front of a bent cross flag, then e-mails the pic to the SPLC.  FBI informants, at the behest of the SPLC, start something called &#8220;National Socialist Movement,&#8221; and FBI informants claiming to be military members post to the website.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the real problem in the real Armed Forces are black and Hispanic gangs.</p>

		<p>Here is the delema facing the White Survivalist movement (or whatever you choose to call it) - specifically, it is people and movements that utilize Nazi symbols and slogans as well as repeating the German Nazi propaganda.</p>
<p>It must be recognized that attempting to repeat rather than refine through rethinking - the White National Socialist idea will result in failure.</p>
<p>First of all, we must learn to tolerate ourselves. Next, we cannot allow one White persons relgious beliefs to dictate the policy for all Whites.  Then, we must begin to plan and practice practical solutions for the future.  That is because the world future without Whites is going to be chaotic.  Whites must be prepared to fall back and unify.  One hundred years ago, most Whites were farmers - it is time to re-establish this necessary set of knowledge and skill.</p>
<p>All the current trends point the future arriving sooner than anyone thinks.</p>

		<p>Whoever wrote this should spend time with blacks in the military when the percentage of them is greater than 10%. The troops returning home after, in some cases years in OIF/OEF, are finding a country they do not recognize (I did) and I don&rsquo;t like it. Weapons are indeed, our friends.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example of why the country can&rsquo;t be straightened out to a workable level no matter who is in charge or what process is attempted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just too many nutty types like this Dees and Foxman who are inherently evil and will be causing trouble for as long as they can to ever expect to have a decent country again.  It just won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Both groups, along with several others, should have been neutralized long ago.  That they haven&rsquo;t been reveals one of the greatest weaknesses of a free society.</p>

		<p>Dees should hang his head in shame at his treacherous double standard.  There are tens of thousands of militant Blacks in the Armed Forces who embrace the Nation of Islam and belong to websites &#8220;for blacks, by blacks&#8221;.  They can even wear their hate tattoos and shirts with FUBU (For Us, By Us) slogans with impunity.  </p>
<p>But of course it&rsquo;s the 40 White guys that must be kicked out for daring to have pride in their race.</p>

		<p>How many black military members read radical black teachings?Any blacks in the military listen to rap music that talks of killing whitey and raping and beating women?I think thats a little extreme.Is the military creating black rapists and future felons Mr. Dees?Is that normal behavior that should be justified?And why in the world would Schoep verify anything?Alot of these leaders are top FBI informers and are  noneffective to any real substance to make change within the system.They point their fingers at groups of people instead of taking responsibility for our own failures.You want to help our people in the most effective way listen to people like Jared Taylor and help support his efforts.</p>

		<p>Actually, nothing will turn an open-minded soldier or Marine into a racist more quickly than serving with blacks in a combat environment.</p>
<p>I did two tours in Vietnam (1965-66/1967-68), first with a rifle company and second with the 5th Special Forces. In that  conflict blacks made up roughly 13% of the men in line companies but overwhelmingly were responsible for the great majority of disciplinary problems, everything from malingering, cowardice, refusal to follow orders, etc.  To be sure there were many good and effective black troopers, but their performance, on average, was substandard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that now that the military is all-volunteer and one&rsquo;s MOS is guaranteed at time of recruitment, there are very few blacks in combat units, which are now overwhelmingly white and Hispanic.  Blacks have reverted to the role they played throughout WW II and previously, which is to say mainly support functions such as supply, transportation, logistics, etc.</p>
<p>Given that perspective, it&rsquo;s quite easy to see how a relative handful of British regulars and Boer irregulars prevailed, armed with single-shot Martini-Henry rifles or smooth-bore muzzle-loading muskets, prevailed over thousands of African tribesmen in numerous engagements throughout the 19th Century.</p>

		<p>   Funny how Mr. Dees doesn&rsquo;t seem worried about the black and hispanic gang members who are known to have enlisted in the military for the specific purpose of acquiring combat training and experience. They will, no doubt, exercise their new skills on the streets once they are home again. Of course, the stateside uniforms will have the crotch drastically lower than issue BDU&rsquo;s. </p>

		<p>There is no such thing as racism against blacks in the military or any where else in the world.  Black dislike by so many different people should be described not as racism, but what it actually is:  A reaction to disgusting black behavior and conduct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really as simple as that.</p>

		<p> I have a pending PTSD case with the VA conserning the many death threats and other abuse I/we suffered under the authority of black NCO&rsquo;s while I served. This type of thing goes on all the time in the military to one degree or another. If you do not believe it,just ask about anyone if there is a double standard in relation to race relations,rules etc that exists. I do not wish to make a big deal of what happened while I served and only hope that the death threats and other abuse is recognized by the military toward my disability claim. The fact of it being racially motivated need not be addressed. I hope they do the right things but I am sure there is pressure within the military to completely ignore the facts of my case due to the discriminatory (anti white) nature of it.</p>

		<p>The biggest irony here, and is there ever a diversity measure that is not dripping with irony, is that he may be right. The military may indeed be training whites who will become domestic terrorists. Just not in the way he thinks.  </p>

		<p>From servicemen I have known it is when whites are in minority units that the racism cmoes out&hellip;black on white racism</p>
<p>It has also appeared to me that there may be a conscious effort to put White and Hispanic women in units with a high percentage of black males in it&hellip;hence the high sexual assault rate in the Army especially, the Marines not so much, and the AF very little that I am aware of.</p>

		<p>If I remember correctly, early in the Iraq War II, a Bantu Muslim militant type threw a grenade at the tent of his own troops, and several men were killed. And yet, Dees is worried about Caucasians?</p>
<p>No wonder this country has not won a war, after the armed forces were desegregated. General George Patton regarded American Bantu troops as unfit for combat. If Bantus were a part of his 3rd army, they&rsquo;d probably still be trying to find their way around Siciliy. Heck, they&rsquo;d think Siciliy was a white woman. </p>

		<p>With Dees&rsquo;vast military experience he is qualified to ask Congress for an investigation.  I am sure he will ask for same if there is any indication of Black military personnel are reported involved in any type of Black power activities.</p>
