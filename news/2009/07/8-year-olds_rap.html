			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shaun McKinnon and Dan Nowicki, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), July 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Liberian refugees who have fled the war-torn nation say the rape of an 8-year-old girl in Phoenix is a horrifying case of families trying to escape violence in their own country only to find it again in their new home.</p>
<p>The attack, which police say was committed by four young Liberian boys, also exposed the darkest sides of the country&rsquo;s long civil war. Boys were recruited to rape, kill and torture, and experts and government leaders said sexual violence remains a challenge as the West African country rebuilds.</p>
<p>The assault also has revealed cultural attitudes about women and assault victims that could take a generation to change. Rape wasn&rsquo;t even outlawed in Liberia until 2006, and victims are still made to feel shameful and even complicit in the attacks on them, aid workers say.</p>
<p>Phoenix police say the local case, which has garnered international attention, is no different. After the girl was attacked on July 16 in a shed at a Phoenix apartment complex, her parents told police to take her away, saying she had brought shame on the family.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, my country is one that has been through quite a bit of trauma,&#8221; he [Liberia&rsquo;s ambassador to the United States, Milton Nathaniel Barnes] told The Arizona Republic. &#8220;And many of the people who are here as refugees are still traumatized after several years, primarily because rape and sexual violence was used as a weapon of war during our crisis. People are still trying to reconcile their own lives with that. But to say that someone would disown a child, or blame a child, to me is unfathomable.</p>
<p>{snip}&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Raised amid rape</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many details remain unclear about when the families of the girl or the four boys accused in the attack settled in Phoenix. Nearly 1,200 Liberian refugees have settled in Arizona since fleeing the war, which ended in 2003, and its aftermath, according to the Arizona Refugee Resettlement Program.</p>
<p>Ali Keita, a Liberian who immigrated to the U.S. in 1997, said many refugees he has worked with lived amid rampant rape and brutal violence in Liberia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said many parents found it hard to maintain control over their children&rsquo;s upbringing as rebel attacks forced them to relocate again and again, but &#8220;there is no excuse for the crime, for the behavior&#8221; of the four boys.</p>
<p>Tony Weedor, who fled Liberia and now helps efforts to rebuild the country, said the war changed his people in ways he still can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not like this before the war,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Since then, young men who were maybe 7 or 8 when it started, they saw their mothers and sisters raped and killed and then they joined the rebels, did the exact same thing. There are 60,000 or 70,000 young men who know nothing but looting and killing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Shame on the family&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Many rape victims in Liberia are children, according to the group Doctors Without Borders, which treats raped girls and women in Liberia. The group told the New York Times this year that of 275 sexual-violence cases treated from January to April, 28 percent involved children age 4 or younger and 33 percent involved children ages 5 through 12.</p>
<p>In 2008, the group said, 70 percent of the rape survivors treated in clinics were children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Some families don&rsquo;t call the police because it will bring shame upon the family, which is wrong,&#8221; Weedor said. &#8220;They are more concerned with the name of the family than the harm done to the child.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We know for a fact that there may be some concerns with communications, in terms of understanding,&#8221; Barnes said. &#8220;These people speak English, yes, but there are certain nuances within the way Liberians express themselves through the English language that we need to make sure is understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., who for years has worked on legislation supporting crime victims, said the dramatic culture clash complicates American comprehension of the situation in Phoenix.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s practically impossible for us to understand a society which has precisely the opposite idea about who should be blamed and who should feel shame and who should be helped or not helped,&#8221; Kyl said Friday at his Phoenix office. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not just a problem for Liberians. There are other people with a similar culture that is, frankly, the problem.&#8221;<br>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t mention what happens when women are gang raped, or children are raped. Their insides can be shredded, their bladders frequently rupture and they leak urine for the rest of their lives which makes them outcasts (assuming they survive, of course).</p>

		<p>I say let them sort out their rapist tendencies in their own country.  Once they&rsquo;ve outgrown that phase (and all their other murderous tendencies), then we&rsquo;ll see about accepting some of them here.  The victim was black Liberian and that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s such a fuss over her.  Had she been white, there would hardly be a peep from the media.</p>

		<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t surprise me anymore that an editor would allow a lead that asinine. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;trying to escape violence in their own country only to find it again in their new home.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if it were Americans who victimized their child. It was their own people who raped their child and then they themselves who continued the abuse by blaming her for the assault and disowning her. you can&rsquo;t escape violence when you bring it with you everywhere you go.  </p>

<p>So the liberians propensity to rape is only an artifact of thier civil war.  But wait:</p>
<p>&#8220;The assault also has revealed cultural attitudes about women and assault victims that could take a generation to change. Rape wasn&rsquo;t even outlawed in Liberia until 2006, and victims are still made to feel shameful and even complicit in the attacks on them, aid workers say.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, rape was only outlawed in 2006.  That means it was legal during all of Liberia&rsquo;s history, even prior to its civil war (which near as I can tell, went on about 20 years).  So maybe the real problem is not the &#8220;legacy of violence&#8221;, but simply the fact that a large number of liberians appear to be violent rapists.  So why don&rsquo;t we keep them out of our country?</p>

		<p> The thing that bothers me the most about the &#8220;elites&#8221; of this country that keep telling us how great multiculturalism can be is that they never experience it first hand.They live in gated communities,send their children to private schools,ride in limousines and hire armed body guards.<br>
 I think the majority of the people that post on this board realise that there will always be people with a lot of money and that&rsquo;s ok. I just wish they would stop pushing these people onto everyone else.</p>

		<p>The same thing happened after the LA riots. Black families fleeing the violence, took the violence with them to other cities, because they and their kids were the cause of the violence to begin with. </p>

<p>This smacks of the silly notion that behavior is learned rather than innate; nurture vs nature. </p>
<p>The prevalence of such violence universally spanning multiple generations of specific ethnic groups argues in favor of the fact that genetics cannot be altered in a generation. </p>

		<p>Now lets see if my study and understanding of history over the<br>
last several thousand years,esp European, holds me in good stead   <br>
  I think if we look at all the vicious wars<br>
and feuds from the Ancient Romans to the Vikings right through and beyond the Middle Ages I wonder how they would have dealt with the  issue of prepubescent gang rape.It beggars belief that in this miserable misnomer of a  so called `free` country `Liberia`,the  victim is ostracized by family and  little or nothing is done to punish the perpertrators.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine this type of  act ever being committed or condoned by our European forefathers many centuries ago just as  now its seen by all and sundry as  a morally reprehensible act.<br>
It indeed goes to show the growing cultural gulf between the<br>
sheer savagery and barbarism of the dark continent and whats left of our once great Western  civilization.<br>
 Once again all blame is placed on a brutal civil war and there is no examination of the racial dynamics.If ever the saying ` `You can take the African out of Africa but cant take the<br>
Africa out of the African` has pertinent relevance then<br>
surely this must be an excellent example.Which also  has  ominous repercussions as these so called refugees  increase in number along with their culturally induced barbarous acts .<br>
  And as our politicians wring their heads exclaiming we<br>
cannot undertand these different cultural values the ineviable problems which arise are not prevented,not confronted and  <br>
remain unsolved.Consequently and most tragically the number of victims,black and non black, will inevitably increase.          </p>

		<p>&ldquo;There are 60,000 or 70,000 young men who know nothing but looting and killing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement alone should be reason enough to not bring any of them to this country.  I heartily feel compassion for the people effected in that country, but it (the compassion) is not enough to want to subject me and my family to the same atrocities.</p>
<p>Also, the quote that claims that there are certain nuances with the way Liberians express themselves, seems to be trying to rationalize why they don&rsquo;t want their daughter to remain with them.  Sorry, but that is a very poor rationalization. </p>
<p>The fact that Liberia was founded/colonized by freed American Slaves and subjected to one of the longest periods of tyranny, oppression, depravity and economic plunder, even by African standards, should be proof enough to anyone what would happen to this country if there was a Black-majority rule.</p>

		<p>The Blacks that returned to Liberia from the United States make up a very very small percentage of the Liberian population. Upon their return they created a plantation economy and basically enslaved the native Blacks. It didn&rsquo;t last very long and the whole place has been in a state of &#8220;civil war&#8221; ever since.<br>
This news article should read &#8220;rape reveals horrors of Liberian culture, attitudes towards rape.&#8221; They try to blame war for the fact that Africans tolerate rape but this is found all over Africa even in Mandela&rsquo;s workers paradise were in a recent poll 1 in 4 men ADMITTED to having raped a woman. This isn&rsquo;t a Liberian problem its a BLACK one.</p>

Theoretically he caused more deaths than that of Mary Jo Kopechne. RIP<br>
