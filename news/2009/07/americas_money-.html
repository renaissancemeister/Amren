			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mychal Massie, WorldNetDaily, June 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tell me how an apology for slavery and Jim Crow makes blacks any better off. The answer, of course, is that it doesn&rsquo;t. But to that point, it never was about apologies was it? It has always been about reparations.</p>
<p>Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., head of the Congressional Black Caucus said, &#8220;I would not want to have any language in place that would deny anyone, any citizen, the right to address a grievance.&#8221; For those not familiar with legalese  &mdash;  &#8220;right to address a grievance&#8221; is a benign way of saying, &#8220;right to sue for megabucks based on a real or perceived wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said, &#8220;I feel that some method other than just an apology should be made  &mdash;  people should be whole.&#8221; Once again, for those not familiar with the language, &#8220;should be made whole,&#8221; simplistically put, means &#8220;should get a ton of money to repair a complaint.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that is exactly what has these elapidal, greedy, money-grubbing, racial extortionists so exercised. They want money, and the apology is simply the viscous lubricant that greases the machinations of their intent. Even more egregious is the fact that most of the black citizenry, being overcome with their own dreams of what reparation dollars will buy  &mdash;  are too blind and/or jaundiced to understand that they are the useful idiots in a much larger and more complex shell-game.</p>
<p>First of all, America has apologized  &mdash;  often and repeatedly. America apologized when over 700,000 men, women and children died fighting a war that ultimately led to the end of slavery. America apologized by being a country with the good sense and decency to abolish slavery and Jim Crow. America apologized with equal rights, civil rights, Great Society initiatives, race-based affirmative action programs, Act 101, race-based contracts and set-asides, race-based business loans and mortgages, the permitting of segregated dormitories, graduations and proms to placate race mongers, color-coded jobs, and the list goes on and on. But the cry is for more  &mdash;  and those who profit from white guilt, coupled with corrupt opportunity, are working diligently to extort trillions of dollars based on a debt that has already been paid.</p>
<p>The Congressional Black Caucus is upset because contained in the Senate version of the apology resolution is a disclaimer that reads in part, &#8220;Nothing in this resolution authorizes or supports any claim against the United States.&#8221; In common parlance that means, &#8220;You get a written apology, but not one penny in addition to same.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} [Senator Thompson] further indicated that it was the intentions of CBC members to vote against the apology specifically because they couldn&rsquo;t cash in on it.</p>
<p>{snip} The people clamoring for an apology are not interested in an &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry&#8221; unless it is accompanied by trillions of reparation dollars. {snip}</p>
<p>NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous, in a prepared statement, said, &#8220;The apology for slavery and the era of Jim Crow is long overdue and is the first step toward healing the wounds of African-American men and women throughout this country.&#8221; Note the language, &#8220;first step toward healing.&#8221; Anyone care to bet on what the second step is?</p>
<p>The wounds of Jim Crow and slavery have been healed for black families  &mdash;  but these entrepreneurs of racial discord and immiseration don&rsquo;t want that to be understood  &mdash;  because there is no financial quid-pro-quo in that scenario for them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tell me how &#8220;all races, ethnicity and national origins&#8221; are going to benefit from this shakedown. You may not agree with me, and I&rsquo;m sure many do not, but no apology and certainly no reparations are going to make a bit of difference in the lives of those they are supposedly for. {snip}</p>

		<p><i>Tell me how an apology for slavery and Jim Crow makes blacks any better off. The answer, of course, is that it doesn&rsquo;t.</i></p>
<p>Not the average black, but an apology will inevitably lead to reparations, and reparations will be a monetary equivalent of a rolling bordello for the black civil rights elite, aforementioned NAACP President Ben Jealous included.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I saw some sort of reparations confab on CSPAN, headed by black talk radio host Bob Law.  One of the panelists said, and the rest of them and Law agreed, that reparations should not be given to all blacks, on a prorated, per capita basis.  Their reasoning was that the average black person would be so traumatized upon just seeing the reparations checks, and have PTSD-style flashbacks in earnest, that they would inevitably go out and blow the checks on shoes and wasteful bling.  Instead, so saith them, the reparations money should be used for &#8220;black nation building.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, they know who splurgey blacks are, and want the money to become their personal cornucopia and sinecure pot.  Ben Jealous and people like Law and Cornell West came to do good, and would wind up doing very well indeed.</p>

		<p> Paying reperations would be akin to paying  blackmail. No payment would ever be enough and as soon as the money is spent, they would just come back for more.<br>
  For about the last forty years, the white race has given in to ever demand of the black race. They are now like a spoiled rotten child who&rsquo;s parents give them everything in the futile hope of trying to keep them happy. But like the parents of that child, we will eventually have to give in just to maintain peace.<br>
 The white guilt disease will eventually run it&rsquo;s course. The true question is: How long will it take? <br>

		<p>Yet again I would like to ask the opinion of amreners  &mdash;  -whether black fellows like Connerly, Sowell, or Walter Williams, have any place in an America in which racialist ideas become public policy?  It&rsquo;s just an honest question.  Are we talking deportation, or just freedom of association taken to the point of businesses being allowed to serve only those that they desire to serve?  Same question goes for other non-white races.</p>

		<p>AS the courts have ruled out &#8220;reparations&#8221; even from businesses whose earlier days benefited from slavery it seems that the race hustlers figure their only chance is to intimidate the congress into making it happen, whether anyone thinks it makes sense or not. Race hustlers are just trying to increase their status and money donations.</p>
<p>Reparations make no sense since the black descendants of slaves are beneficiaries of slavery and lucky to be here - notice that no blacks are pining away for life in sunny West Africa. In fact even the transported slaves themselves were relatively lucky in that the tribal war victors would have killed them (or the men at least) if they had no one to sell them to. </p>
<p>America has more than paid for this awful institution as the article points out. Can you imagine any African tribe ever having a civil war to end some moral anguish of having slaves? HA! Only white people would do that and the blacks are just shameless enough to demand money from whites whose ancestors  paid so much to end slavery.<br>

<p>Also, if they raise my taxes so that the government can pay slavery reparations, then they need to pay me Affirmative Action Reparations!</p>

<p>&#8220;Making whole&#8221; is an Anglo-Saxon concept, but never mind.  In this case, the only loss suffered by today&rsquo;s &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; is that of their natural abode in Africa.  So, yes, let us indeed make them whole, starting with Rep. Thompson on the first plane back.</p>

		<p>Reparations to blacks are a joke. Once they are given a large sum of money for slavery, the majority will exhibit a phenomenon known as &#8220;ghetto rich.&#8221; They will buy houses they can&rsquo;t afford, cars and SUVs that are expensive to maintain, silly FUBU fashions, and loud expensive bling. When they blow through their money like a drunken sailor, they will complain that they were not compensated enough. The cycle will start all over again, and again, and again,</p>

		<p>3 Ludwig, regarding the place of Blacks In the North American White Republic, we will take a page from the old USSR, the lodestar for our Red antagonists.  The law against &#8220;Anti-Soviet activity&#8221; can be a model for our own legislation.  Any person, of any race, found guilty of Anti-White Activity, will be sentenced to deportation or a life of servitude, whichever best serves the interests of the White Race.  While tens of millions of Whites will run afoul of this law, it will have a very disparate impact on Blacks.  Given what we have endured already, bearing the burden of having Mychal Massie and his kind around will be a relative pleasure.  </p>

		<p>Concurring with &#8220;Say It&#8221;&hellip; while slavery was not desirable for slaves, neither was it as bad as Hollywood hype tried to make it. Like prize cattle and fine horses, trained slaves were valuable property representing a considerable financial investment for owners. So what RATIONAL slave owner would be stupid enough to brutalize his slaves? As long as the slave obeyed orders, did a reasonably good job and was not a &#8220;trouble-maker&#8221;, he or she could expect decent treatment, even the occasional reward or treat from the master and mistress. Slaves often were freed after the master&rsquo;s death as provided in his will.</p>

		<p>When anyone apologizes it is an admission of guilt.When you admit that you are guilty then comes the punishment.Without admission of guilt legally there would be no recourse.This is one step toward getting what blacks want.Little by little step by step they are building their case for future justification and compensation.Our politicians think through this appeasement they will go away.They are not going to go away until they have total victory.Guess what that is?When I was a child a black woman told me &#8221; When we take over your going to be my slave&#8221;.I was 9 years old and she was an adult.WAKE UP WHITE PEOPLE!</p>

<p>Not a bad idea. Deportation was and is a pie in the sky idea. There are already places in the Old South that are predominantly black, and black culture permeates all of the Old South from the Blues to red beans and rice to ecstatic African styles of Christian worship. The black cultural home is already established. That is a hot, muggy, swampy climate that is the closest thing to Africa that we have here in America. </p>
<p>Whites are from a different environment: green, rainy, cloudy, with mountains and valleys and farmlands and open wilderness too. We already have that, and those places are already the whitest parts of America. </p>
<p>Turn off all those expensive air conditioners in the Old South and Southwest, and whites will not be doing too well. Get rid of all that Vitamin D milk and blacks will not be doing too well in northern latitudes. Heat exhaustion and severe sunburn is not any more fun than Rickets. Maybe that is nature saying something. </p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before on this site, the institution of slavery in early America has afforded American blacks a privileged status among all black Africans, the highest standard of living, unparalleled freedom, unmatched prosperity, and even the choice of eating themselves into the grossest state of obesity of any black Africans in the world.</p>

		<p>  If anything as stupid as this reparations nonsence were to happen, would the blacks born next year (10,20,30, 200 years) also get free stuff? If so I can just see a giant leap in black birth rate (if that is even possible), so those too could get free money that they have had nothing to do with.</p>

		<p>The US Blacks&rsquo; concern for reparations smacks of tribalism.  Aside from applying today&rsquo;s morals to those of 150 years ago, there is no legal or ethical standing for me to be held accountable for acts of another that were done in the distant past.  This is especially egregious as many whites&rsquo; ancestors were not in the US at the time slavery was legal.  The reparations argument is based on the black US tribe wanting retribution from the white US tribe for a perceived wrong delivered by perceived tribal ancestors long gone. This is itself racist as well as a primitive social construct.  In this country we have ample legal and social presidence counter to tribal theories of righting wrongs of that sort. A crime or debt committed by an individual is not the responsibility of family members, let alone broader tribal affiliations inclusive of racial groupings.  Further, enslavement of all races by all races has been a common characteristic throughout history.  And in the English speaking world it was whites that abolished the practice and freed the slaves.  Please send reparations to the whites who championed and fought for that freedom.</p>

		<p>Schoolteacher, thank you for answering my question.  I wish others would also make the same attempt, because these things need to be thought through.</p>
<p>Now, as to your answer  &mdash;  surely you can&rsquo;t be serious about deporting probably tens of millions of people, including white people, guilty of &#8216;anti-white activity&rsquo; (as if Congress would ever pass such a piece of legislation.  Have you ever heard of the 14th amendment?)  Following your Soviet example, are you also in favor of creating an American Cheka?  Your idea works for illegal aliens only  &mdash;  and so far, we haven&rsquo;t even been able to do that much.  What country will take all your deportees?</p>
<p>Not only is your idea impractible, it is not agreeable to the concept of American liberty  &mdash;  a concept which we ought to hold dear.</p>
<p>Keep thinking.  It is long past time for action, and we don&rsquo;t even have any good ideas yet.</p>

<p>Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said, &ldquo;I feel that some method other than just an apology should be made &mdash; people should be whole.&rdquo; Once again, for those not familiar with the language, &ldquo;should be made whole,&rdquo; simplistically put, means &ldquo;should get a ton of money to repair a complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do these people not read the newspapers? America is bankrupt; the only thing missing is a formal admission of that fact. If they want a pile of worthless paper, they should be careful what they wish for.</p>

<p>Anyway who thinks there is going to be a &#8220;North American White Republic,&#8221; is delusional.  There will be a North American White Republic right after Hugh Hefner leaves me the Playboy mansion in his will.  </p>
<p>For those living in the real world, the questions are simpler:<br>
1.  Will white demographics stabalize at 40%, or 65% of US population?<br>
2.  Will the parts of the country where whites make up 90% of the population or more, be economically viable places to raise children?<br>
3.  Will white guilt abate?<br>
4.  Will affirmative action end?<br>
5.  Will Mr. Massie&rsquo;s views receive more support from both whites and non-whites?  </p>

		<p>Thomas Sowell did not speak of a good effect on the culture of the conqueror but of the conquered. </p>
<p>He points out that the British Isles too was once quite primitive. Those peoples also greatly benefited in the long run by invasion and occupation from the then advanced Roman culture.<br>
 <br>
The worrying part of this is precisely that the conqueror culture in that case, as maybe in ours too, was later dissipated into oblivion.</p>

<p>&#8220;White Cornerback&#8221; basically stole my thunder on what I was going to say in response - but just to re-emphasize, Blacks(all 40 million of them) aren&rsquo;t going anywhere. There is no point in pretending otherwise. <br>
America, on a national level, is essentially a lost cause. The only hope we have is to create as many majority(if not exclusively) White enclaves as possible and continue to fight a government and system antagonistic to our people. The individuals you mention, Sowell etc., are useful in that latter fighting process, so in my mind, that is really the only role they play in White racialist circles. It&rsquo;s a matter of pragmatism, not ideology if you will. </p>

		<p>Another aspect of (black) slavery that is completely overlooked is the many skilled slaves who ran side businesses.  Those who were skilled in such trades as builders, cabinetmakers, carpenters, farriers and other occupations quite often got rich and were able to buy their freedom.<br>
&#8220;The slave chronicles&#8221; which interviewed ex-slaves (about 1910) shows a much DIFFERENT aspect of slavery that is almost never mentioned.  Many of the ex-slaves interviewed expressed a certain &#8220;fondness&#8221; for their situation.  They liked not having to worry about such things as personal belongings or a place to live; these things were taken care of by the &#8220;master&#8221;.  This in itself does not justify slavery; it merely points out that one has to look at the context of the TIMES when slavery was &#8220;legal&#8221;.  After the demise of slavery, many blacks signed on as &#8220;sharecroppers&#8221;; their situations quite often were much worse.<br>
Blacks that were brought here had it much better.<br>
Author Ben Richburg (who is black) went to africa to seek his &#8220;roots&#8221;.  His &#8220;relatives&#8221; wanted to involve him in their tribal wars.  After a short time, he couldn&rsquo;t wait to get back to the USA.  He later wrote in one of his books that he was glad that his ancestors had been brought to this country; slavery notwithstanding.<br>
Another misperception about slavery is the number of black slaveholders that were in the USA.  An article in &#8220;American Heritage&#8221; magazine called &#8220;Selling Poor Steven&#8221; outlines the extent of the slave trade and ownership among blacks.  Black slaveholders were much more common that is generlly believed. It is also stated that black slaveowners were quite often much more cruel to their charges than white slaveowners.<br>
Alex haley&rsquo;s &#8220;roots&#8221; series did much to perpetuate falsehoods about the &#8220;peculiar institution&#8221; of slavery.<br>
American blacks seeking to find their &#8220;roots&#8221; by going to africa are shocked when they are informed that THEIR OWN PEOPLE sold their ancestors into bondage.</p>

		<p>White cornerback and HH, I appreciate your pragmatism and I am in general agreement with you.  But I asked the question in the first place, in part, because of the views of some amreners like &#8216;Anonymous&rsquo; above, who says that we can deport 40 million blacks to Africa by force.  I can only add to your pragmatic response that not only is such an idea for dreamers, it would be unjust, because it is disingenuous to take advantage of the goodwill of blacks like Sowell, Jesse Lee Peterson, and so on, to further an agenda that results in them being asked to leave the country that they are trying to defend  &mdash;  unlike so many blacks.  Should blacks that have served in the US armed forces also be forced to leave the country?  I say that is unjust.</p>
<p>Now, failing deportation, we are going to have to learn to get along with a lot of people that we don&rsquo;t like too much, so the question is how best to do that.  It seems to me that the only reasonable policies that have been suggested to that end have already been stated by Jared Taylor  &mdash;  the end of immigration and the repeal of the 1964 civil rights act, which implies the end of affirmative action.  I think we ought to put our full energy into achieving those goals, and forget about deportation or legally enforced resegregation or anything that is just never going to happen without a racial war.</p>
<p>I am not in favor of a racial war, but it seems that some commentators around here are.  I don&rsquo;t think such people are reasonable or sane, frankly.  We fought a Civil War in part at least to free the slaves, and are we now going to fight a war against the descendents of those we freed?  How many people in America want such a thing?  Even more pointedly, who in the world should want such a thing?</p>

		<p>15 Schoolteacher and 3 Ludwig: I would agree and disagree. Clearly we need to work out laws that benefit whites, with the stipulation that they are not aimed at harming other groups; all other groups like blacks and Jews need to do the same. I don&rsquo;t think anti-white activity (or its lack) need be the only or basic criterion defining group membership. Rather, there should be the positive factors of ethnocultural similarity (unless they are ethnically blended whites) and common economic issues. Ethnic or racial background is a vital bonding component of a healthy society, but so are the economic issues that face people. It does limited good to have a common ethnic background if people are being stiffed economically (eg current trade policies, established by whites, not minorities) by others or even by people of their own cultural background. Further, is a society really a society if people are neglected in spite of their capacity to work? If anything, the ongoing attacks on whites by minorites and the Left should have shown us that as whites we need to stick together, and this requires laying out new policies and laws that enable this, based in a spirit of solidarity if not mutual benefit (which is not the same thing as wage equality). No non-whites should own or be in charge of any white economic or cultural institutions, for example, unless they have proven themselves to have whites&rsquo; best interests at heart. This however might be difficult to prove, considering how devious some people can be, and in any case should have no place as an independent white society struggles to get on its feet. Further, some whites will not have whites&rsquo; best interests at heart either, and may be selfish and only promote their own interests, so IMO should not find a place in our society if we find they have motives inimical to ours. Schoolteacher has already suggested the latter point, and maybe imprisonment or fines would be a good first step before deportation depending on the anti-white crime committed.</p>
<p>In line with the above, then, my line on moral blacks like Mr. Massie is that, though they would be respected if not welcomed socially, their best place is as leaders of a socioecomically independent black society. He probably already understands his people and has bonds with them, and otherwise the weaker and worst elements of black society might come to the fore. <br>

		<p>35 Ludwig: You write of pragmatism, of being reasonable, and of justice.  To me, pragmatism, reason, and justice are no longer the rules of the game, they are irrelevant and anachronistic.  This is not 1969, when people might have reasonably thought that outlawing racial discrimination and giving Blacks a little edge in hiring would allow them to achieve equality.  We can no longer pretend that letting a few non-White immigrants in won&rsquo;t disturb anything, it will just add a little color to our lily-White communities and let these poor people escape their wretched homelands.  The rules have changed, and it wasn&rsquo;t us that changed them.  Our Rulers have disregarded the principles of American liberty when it comes to us, so there&rsquo;s no reason that we ought hold those principles dear when it comes to them either.  </p>
<p>We Whites are being displaced, and there is no end in sight.  President Clinton openly applauded the prospect of Whites becoming a minority, and went unchallenged by the GOP, clearly indicating their acceptance of the idea.  So where is there any place for compromise?  We can&rsquo;t even openly discuss these issues without putting our jobs at risk.  Where is the reverence for free speech in this country?  They have left the shell of the First Amendment and gutted the meaning, so why should I respect the rights of the censors?  You doubt that Congress would pass legislation banning Anti-White activity.  You&rsquo;re absolutely right, they would be the first ones jailed under such laws.  They have, regardless of party, resolutely refused to even make an effort to control illegal immigration.  How can anyone think that there is any political solution possible, let alone one in accord with traditional Anglo-Saxon law, is beyond me.  My suggestion for laws modeled on Soviet laws was somewhat facetious, but ironically just, for the new class of diversity commissars that has developed in this country.  Such laws could only be passed when there was no more need for them.  </p>
<p>In post #35, you write of ending immigration and affirmative action, as if those things were possible, just like we were taught in civics class.  You say that you&rsquo;re not in favor of racial war, yet you advocate the two measures that would guarantee it.  Black and Hispanics think that affirmative action is an inalienable right.  Hispanics and other foreigners think that unlimited immigration is an inalienable right.  Why shouldn&rsquo;t they, since in practice the government has made them so.  Oppose those privileges and the non-Whites will count you as an enemy, not someone they disagree with, but someone to hate passionately.  They will accept no compromise.</p>
<p>Americans are so used to domestic peace that they can&rsquo;t imagine the sort of conflict that fills the history books.  But we have imported tens of millions from places where strife and squalor are the norm, and they see us as easy pickings.  This will not be resolved in courtrooms and legislatures.  </p>

<p>Do you realize that if you revoke the 1964 civil rights act, you are going to have a racial war?  That would be the inevitable outcome of your action.  Deportation would be the next logical step.</p>
