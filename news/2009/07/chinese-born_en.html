<h1>Chinese-Born Engineer Guilty of Economic Espionage</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Taxin, AP, July 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Chinese-born engineer was convicted Thursday of stealing trade secrets critical to the U.S. space program in the nation&rsquo;s first economic espionage trial.</p>
<p>A federal judge found former Boeing Co. engineer Dongfan &#8220;Greg&#8221; Chung guilty of six counts of economic espionage and other charges for hoarding 300,000 pages of sensitive documents in his home, including information about the U.S. space shuttle and a booster rocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trust Boeing placed in Mr. Chung to safeguard its proprietary and trade secret information obviously meant very little to Mr. Chung,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney wrote in his 31-page ruling. &#8220;He cast it aside to serve the PRC (People&rsquo;s Republic of China), which he proudly proclaimed as his &#8216;motherland.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors accused the 73-year-old stress analyst of using his 30-year career at Boeing and Rockwell International to steal the documents. They said investigators found papers stacked throughout Chung&rsquo;s house that included sensitive information about a fueling system for a booster rocket  &mdash;  documents that Boeing employees were ordered to lock away at the close of work each day. They said Boeing invested $50 million in the technology over a five-year period.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After the ruling, defense attorney Thomas Bienert said he planned to appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big feature (of this case) is not about what China wanted Mr. Chung to do, but about what Mr. Chung was willing to do,&#8221; Bienert said outside the courtroom. &#8220;There is no evidence that China used or benefited from anything in this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chung had been free on $250,000 bail before the verdict. His attorneys asked the judge to let him remain with his family in Orange until sentencing, but the government said a man facing such a long sentence with close ties to China could easily flee to the Chinese consulate and never return.</p>

		<p>One of many Chinese who are &#8220;serving the motherland&#8221; right here in the United States. I once worked with a Chinese who&rsquo;d lived here for years. I spoke to him in Mandarin and English. I made the mistake of criticizing Communism, and he became extremely defensive of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and became extremely critical of the U.S. government and the United States in general. His attitude was the exact opposite of the media-generated image of the poor immigrant who just wants a better life and the freedoms that America has. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve made comments on Chinese workers in sensitive security places in the U.S. before. I got some nasty responses from some Chinese posters, because I guess I hit a sore spot, like for instance, when I brought up Mr. Lee and the ten missing high security tapes. He was saved buy the Chinese community who circled the wagons to pay for his legal defense, and were more interested, apparently, in his not goint to jail, than whether of not he was a spy. I guess it&rsquo;s all part of how we are &#8220;enriched&#8221; by diversity&#8221;, as one respected AmRen poster always puts it.</p>

<p>How unusual!  I mean, because he crossed the US border and indicated a desire to be a citizen of this country, surely the transition itself is enough proof to this government that they have his complete, undivided loyalty.  Everybody knows that crossing a border magically changes a person&rsquo;s loyalty from the country he left to the one where he makes his new home.</p>
<p>Anybody so dense they arrive at another conclusion has got to be impared some way.  You know, like being a racist.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know for certain that Wen Ho Lee was guilty but there was absolutely enough evidence to warrant an investigation, as you noted.</p>
<p>His defenders played the race card shamelessly while chanting &#8220;racial profiling!&#8221;. Of course some of them were veterans of the Old Left who had previously declared the innocence of Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs. </p>

<p>Gee, who&rsquo;d have ever guessed that a man might have more loyalty to the nation which bore him than to a bland, publicly held corporation which cuts him a check every two weeks.  Obviously this comes as some kind of revelation to a U.S. Judge like Mr. Carney, who probably can not conceive of someone having loyalty to their own country.</p>

		<p>Last year in Canada&rsquo;s capital, just before the Olympics, ethnic Chinese stood beneath the flag of the PRC with a sign proclaiming their racial loyalty.  The sign read, &#8220;one China - one family&#8221;  </p>
<p>When officials of the Chinese state bureaucracy visit Canada, they show a great amount of deference. Some may not like the communist party, but they all love and identify with Chinese nationalism.</p>

		<p>It would have been much better if Ameria had remained labor self-sufficient like she was in the past. The is no labor market-economic justification for importing even one asian LEGAL immigrant since 1965. And one you throw in demographic and ecological issues, it is obvious that the case against asian LEGAL immigrants is very strong.</p>
<p>If you listen to the post 1965 asian &#8220;Americans&#8221;, they would have you believe that without asians, Native Born White America would never be able to produce her own engineers,scientists, doctors and computer programmers. This is a lie. For starters, Native Born White America manged to twelve Native Born White Alpha males on the moon. And the technological workforce that these 12 alpha Native Born White Males on the moon were 100 percent Native Born White Americans. </p>
<p>The lies of the post-1965 asians must be confronted exposed.</p>
<p>The passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act was a great benefit to Native Born White Amerians in an earlier century. And we can thank an Irish immigrant for its passage. Socialist and labor leader Samuel Gompers was a supporter of the Chinese Exclusion Act. </p>
<p>Post-1965 asians in Ameria are the mortal enemy of Native Born White Americans. They are actively involved in the destruction of who knows how many centuries of Native Born White Amerian Enginering talent-including future Nativ Born White Amerian Engineering talent that will never be developed. Post-1965 asians in America are waging a vicious race war aainst the Native Born White Majority.</p>

		<p>So is anyone going to ask the questions?</p>
<p>Yes he violated security protocols, but no mention of actually giving the information to Red China..  </p>
<p>However, how does someone steal, print, store, access, 300,000 pages of classified documents, take them home, and NOBODY noticed<br>
?</p>
<p>Is this ANOTHER failure of security??  </p>
<p>Is this ANOTHER Madoff-Type failure: The system is so broken, incompetent, and corrupt that a ROGUE individual can pillage a company, organization, or government for years and nobody notices!!!</p>
<p>When are we going to wake up, individuals cannot not steal, embezzle, cheat anyone out of large amounts of money or classified inro unless the system AND the guardians of said funds and documents are involved or completely incompetent.</p>
<p>We have a systems wide failure in America and the attention is on certain individuals NOT on the people who develop, guard, and create these systems of security, government etc.</p>

		<p>To all you &#8220;conservatives&#8221; ou there. If you voted for Repulican Presidents and Senators, you voted and continue to vote for Chinese tecnological and military espionage within the borders of America.</p>
<p>The Republican party is the mortal enemy of Native Born White Americans. Nothing could be more obvious.</p>
<p>For those of you who are Alex Jones fans:Alex Jones is a fanatical supporter of asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION. This makes Alex Jones a fanatical supporter of job theft, wage theft, tecnologocal and military secrets theft. If you don&rsquo;t believe me..go ask him.</p>

<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t dispute the numbers, but in practice I really don&rsquo;t believe that East asians are signifigantly brighter than whites.  It&rsquo;s more like the other way around.  I work as an accounting consultant for Kaiser in LA.  We all know how this company likes to push diversity, especially their CEO George Halvorson.  I&rsquo;m sure he lives in an all-white enclave in the bay area.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve had to deal with repeated mistakes made by chinese/asian employees within this company.  A lot of it is just common sense, but they seem to have none.  Another trait I&rsquo;ve noticed is that if they can push their work onto you, they&rsquo;ll do it in a heartbeat with absolutely no guilt whatsoever.  I&rsquo;ve read other posters on here say bring back the chinese exclusion, and I have to agree with them.</p>

<p>The reason why the Chinese have to steal high-tech secrets from America is that Asians are smart, but they can&rsquo;t innovate. They are very good at following directions precisely or improving upon advances made by white, Westerners.</p>

<p>You keep hearing the wrong info, guy.  China has a national I.Q. of 100, the same as the groupI.Q. for whites in the US.  Factor in blacks and Hispanics and the I.Q. average drops to 98.  </p>
<p>There is much more at play in determining intelligence than I.Q., although that would be the main ingredient, of course.  There has to be other factors at work that decides intelligence besides group I.Q. figures.  Otherwise, how do we explain why one race accomplishes far more than another?  It&rsquo;s got to be due to factors not yet coinsidered in overall intelligence, but I&rsquo;m positive they will be included eventually.</p>
<p>Too, some Asians will score higher on average than whites regarding math, but whites score higher than all Asians on verbal portions of tests.</p>
<p>Also, can you discount success entirely?  Absolutely not.  Whites are successful because they have qualities and intelligence above the other races of the earth.  There&rsquo;s no question of that.</p>
<p>And, let me ask you one other question.  Even if some Asian group I.Q. average is higher than the white average by 3 to 5 points, aren&rsquo;t you pretty silly to describe them as &#8220;much more intelligent?&#8221;  3 to 5 points are pretty much negligible.</p>
<p>Incidentally, let me pose another question to ponder:  If blacks in the US have a group average of about 85 why is it they could never accomplish the successes of Indians whose group average is 81?  We see many doctors, engineers, etc., who are Indian, but almost zero blacks, unless they&rsquo;ve been awarded a worthless AA diploma.  Too, could blacks EVER build the civilizations Indians have and could they ever have the intelligence or creativity to come up with the religious concepts of Indians, to name only a few things Indians do that outperform blacks.</p>
<p>I.Q. tests are excellent for determining who can learn, but they fall far short of providing a basis that gives a true evaluation of intelligence.  </p>

		<p>There was this guy of japanese descent that hung out with my group of friends in late high school and early college.  He used to make a joke that we shouldn&rsquo;t question his math skills because he&rsquo;s Asian.  If I had thought about it at the time I would have responded that if Asians are so much better at math, then why did Japan go to war with a country (the US) with a population two and a half times larger not to mention industrial output.  </p>
