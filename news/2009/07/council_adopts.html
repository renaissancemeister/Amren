<h1><a href="https://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=821894">Council Adopts Don&rsquo;t Ask Policy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jordan Carleo-Evangelist, Albany Times Union, July 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The city waded cautiously into the national immigration debate Monday night when lawmakers called on police and other public safety workers not to ask people their immigration status if they are &#8220;not posing a threat to the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Common Council approved the measure 14-0, with one member absent from the chamber, only after adding a clause that specifically said the intent was not to encourage people to live illegally in the United States.</p>
<p>Rather, supporters said, the resolution is meant to encourage a climate of trust and acceptance that will among other things enable immigrants  &mdash;  documented and otherwise  &mdash;  to access emergency services without fear of arrest and detention.</p>
<p>&#8220;What this is not is a free pass for someone to engage in illegal activity,&#8221; said Councilman James Sano, who expressed concern that the measure was being spun by some people to mean the city was asking police to turn a blind eye to crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t let the haters distort what this is not,&#8221; Sano urged.</p>
<p>The measure is not binding on city employees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In adopting the resolution, Albany joined at least 30 other cities, towns and counties throughout the country  &mdash;  including Boston, Cleveland and New York City  &mdash;  that have passed similar measures, many of them more strongly worded, said its chief sponsor, Councilwoman Barbara Smith.</p>
<p>At its core, Smith said, the resolution is another bulwark against racial profiling and a mechanism to keep questions if immigration status out of situations where they have no place.</p>

<p>Really?  I thought the &#8216;Illegal&rsquo; part in &#8216;Illegal Immigration&rsquo; made it pretty clear that it was, you know, illegal.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Don&rsquo;t ask&rsquo; worked for me too last time I delt with the police and happened to have a warrent out for my arrest (for not paying a fine imposed by the dog catcher - and not for something like being in the country illegally). Worked for me. Not. </p>

		<p>&#8220;racial profiling&#8221;? So basically, foreigners are here illegally skirting our laws and us white folks our white society are the bad guys?</p>

		<p>Councilman James Sano is &#8220;concerned&#8221; about hateful folks getting the wrong idea and not about illegal immigrants and immigration. Hopefully after election day he&rsquo;ll be concerned about finding a new job.</p>
<p>Illegal aliens all living in the big city is not the worst place they could be. For someone upset at &#8216;racial profiling&rsquo; James Sano is making sure they all live in one place. </p>

		<p>I think racial profiling has become a convenient excuse for politicians who want to disregard the law.</p>

		<p>Long-abandoned buildings literally falling apart (right in front of the State Capitol, in one case), thousands of no-fine &#8220;ghost tickets&#8221; handed out over the past decade and a half to politically-connected traffic scoflaws, little children gunned down while playing in the street, an 80+% minority public-school system suffering gang wars, city population eternally dropping, no resident parking permit system due to opposition by the state unions, and now Albany has become a &#8220;sanctuary city&#8221; to protect its rapidly increasing illegal alien population.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad my fair city has its priorities straight.</p>

		<p>I can see some sense to this. In atlanta blacks often rob hispanics near check cashing places because they know the hispanics are not likely to contact the police. You also don&rsquo;t want people refusing to be witnesses to violent crimes, or reporting violent crimes because they worry the police can target anyone near them.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of preventing crime, it makes sense to keep law enforcement separate from immigration enforcement.</p>

		<p>If the American citizenry would stop long enough and go to neutral, and see the neccessity of seriously dealing with these traitorous city councils and politicians,they would never dare to enact these policies. All politicians at any level of government care about is getting re-elected. Two years, for Congressman, and many city council and assemblyman. Two years and your voted out, if you don&rsquo;t do the will of the voters. It would be so easy to bend things in the citizenries direction, if they only cared enough.</p>

		<p>What a nest of hypocrisy. The local sleazeball councilman in Albany, trying to invite the dregs of the earth to Albany, has said: </p>
<p>&#8220;What this is not is a free pass for someone to engage in illegal activity,&rdquo; said Councilman James Sano, who expressed concern that the measure was being spun by some people to mean the city was asking police to turn a blind eye to crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>It IS a free pass, moron. It&rsquo;s also a warning sign to business and the middle class, skip Albany. The Tiajuana on the Hudson.</p>

		<p>Looks like I am a &#8220;hater&#8221; again (and I thought that was over with the Constitution Party thing).  :)</p>
<p>sonya - I see your argument, but we want to DIScourage illegal immigration, remember?</p>
<p>So sorry, &#8220;Jose&#8221;, if you get robbed and are too afraid to go to the police.  Try going back home to your &#8220;great&#8221; country of origin (most often Mexico).</p>
