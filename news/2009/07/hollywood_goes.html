<h1>Hollywood Goes on the Attack Again</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kyle Bristow, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> July 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hollywood is the vanguard of the anti-white movement, and several of this year&rsquo;s summer movies are only the latest proof. On a recent visit to a theater I found warnings that the theater discriminates against non-humans. In an obvious analogy to the pre-1960s South, notices specifically banned non-humans from bathrooms and drinking fountains.</p>
<p>These notices were actually advertisements for a movie called <cite>District 9,</cite> a story about human discrimination against peace-loving aliens who have come to Earth as refugees. You can watch the trailer for the move on YouTube.com at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZnpzfcMheA" target="trailer" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WznpzfcMheA.</b></a></p>
<p>Closed-minded humans appear on screen, saying things such as, &#8220;They don&rsquo;t belong here.&#8221; &#8220;We are spending so much money to keep them here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least they are keeping them separate from us.&#8221; &#8220;They must go.&#8221; &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t they just leave?&#8221;</p>
<p>The movie is set in South Africa, and before the phrase &#8220;They are not human&#8221; comes on the screen, viewers might think white South Africans had revived Apartheid. Some viewers might not even realize &#8220;they&#8221; are aliens, and think the phrase &#8220;They are not humans&#8221; is supposed to be what South African whites think of blacks.</p>

<p>There is a website, <a href="https://www.sonypictures.net/movies/district9/" target="trailer" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>https://www.sonypictures.net/movies/district9/,</b></a> that leads to several <cite>District 9</cite> websites, some of which pretend that the story in the movie has actually come to pass. One site is advertises a fictitious company called Multinational United, which offers high-paid careers for people who must deal with non-humans. The same company also offers low-paid jobs for non-humans as janitors in non-human dormitories and handlers of non-human garbage. Job offerings for non-humans are even offered in an invented foreign language that is supposed to be the language of this alien species.</p>
<p>The same site lists regulations for non-humans, who must live in a special area called District 9  &mdash;  from which the movie&rsquo;s name is taken  &mdash;  and work mostly in mines. Here are some rules for them:</p>
<p>&#8220;Non-humans must wear identification tags at all time.&#8221; &#8220;Non-humans are not permitted to own property.&#8221; &#8220;In large capacity public places, non-humans must sit in designated seats or viewing areas.&#8221; &#8220;Any trespassing [by a non-human] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is grounds for on-site extermination or indefinite detention.&#8221; &#8220;Sexual relationships between humans and non-humans are prohibited.&#8221; &#8220;Non-humans must not use public drinking fountains.&#8221; &#8220;Non-humans must use restroom facilities specifically designated for non-human use.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is also a link to a fake newscast made to look like a public safety message released by the government. The video implores viewers to contact the authorities by 800 number if they see any non-humans escaping from District 9. The video concludes with a picture of a wholesome-looking white family with the caption &#8220;Keeping humans safe by keeping non-humans separate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The purpose of the movie, of course, is to mock whites who do not like multiculturalism and multiracialism. The refugee aliens are a metaphor for illegal immigrants living in the United States and Europe. I do not know the story of the movie, which has not yet been released, but humans will no doubt be shown to be xenophobic nativists.</p>
<p>On Facebook, there is a <cite>District 9</cite> group where members can vote on the question:  &#8220;Do non-humans deserve equal rights?&#8221; I voted &#8220;No,&#8221; as did 53 percent of the respondents at that time.</p>

<p><cite>District 9</cite> is the second movie this year that treats humans as inherently evil and aliens as good. A children&rsquo;s animation movie called <cite>Battle for Terra,</cite> which was released in the spring, is set in a future after humans have destroyed their own planet through global warming. The last remnants from Earth invade a planet inhabited by charming, peace-loving aliens, with the intention of wiping them out to claim the planet as their own. The people planning this planet-wide genocide are mostly white men, and in the trailer, it is a black man who speaks out against conquest. You can watch the trailer here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plyRYrqa_4g " target="trailer" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plyRYrqa_4g.</b></a></p>
<p>In both <cite>District 9</cite> and <cite>Battle for Terra,</cite> a human betrays his own species to fight alongside the poor aliens the white men is oppressing. This betrayal is, of course, presented as heroic. The message could not be clearer: It is selfish and brutal to want to have territory just for one&rsquo;s own kind, and it is noble to make way for others who are utterly unlike oneself.</p>

		<p>Funny now that Hollyweird is changing its propaganda when it comes to non-existent fictional aliens of the beyond Earth variety.  I am of the opinion that the snake oil pseudo-science of uFOOLogy has been promulgated by elites to scare people into anti-racist universalist measures, world government and otherwise.  And yes, I think most of that stuff we see going bump in the night is of human doings (i.e. CIA), having nothing to do with ETs.  But they&rsquo;re more than happy for fools like Art Bell to go on night after night about space aliens.</p>
<p>If I had a dime for every guest on the Art Bell show that said that they were telling you something that the government doesn&rsquo;t want you to know, I&rsquo;d be rich.  Yeah, sure, telling us things the government doesn&rsquo;t want us to know, on 500 some odd radio stations, all of them FCC-licensed.  If you want to start talking about something that the government or assorted other elites don&rsquo;t want you to know, be white and talk about race in the Jared Taylorish way.</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t the geniuses who created this movie realise that discrimination against &#8220;non-humans&#8221; is already a widely practiced and perfectly acceptable form of discrimination already?</p>
<p>For instance my non-human dog is subject to most of those rules. The fact that he is better behaved than many humans makes no difference. It&rsquo;s just a blanket discrimination applied to all non-humans that nobody complains about.</p>
<p>I guess they never considered this because in their world the laws that apply to the rest of us don&rsquo;t apply. The consequences of subjecting themselves to minorities don&rsquo;t apply and the limitations of pet ownership don&rsquo;t apply. Everything is &#8220;taken care&#8221; of. So they believe that the world is a rosy bowl of cherries and ordinary peoples concerns and doubts are &#8220;ignorance&#8221;. To use due caution is &#8220;prejudice&#8221; and exercising ones right to free association is &#8220;hate&#8221;.</p>

<p>That sounds like a reductio ad absurdum argument that one of us AR commenters would make in order to mock the open borders crowd. I always knew lefties (especially the Hollywood ones) had little capacity for logical thinking, but this is just rediculous.</p>

<p>The people pushing this stuff on us are beginning to overplay their hand, as they always do. Opposition to illegal immigrants is one issue on which the white population of this country is already considerably aroused.</p>

		<p>I think these films are efforts to tame or subdue any inter-racial strife which may occur in the New World Order. As things continue to unravel, people who are brainwashed are less likely to oppose authority and defend their own interests.  In a way, the release of such films amounts to a subtle attempt at a pre-emptive strike.</p>

It&rsquo;s been said, a novel is a lie masquerading as the truth. This also applies to film and TV.</p>
<p>How many books and film such as To Kill a Mockingbird have brainwashed countless pliable, non-critical minds? And how many films, that don&rsquo;t even deal with race, have the ubiquitous racists whites insulting or beating an innocent black slipped in for no other reason than to create another racial myth in the peoples consciousnesses?</p>
<p>What was it that Twain said, a lie can travel around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes?</p>
<p>To read a book, watch TV or a movie, you&rsquo;d believe that knuckle-dragging, Neanderthal whites spend their lives hunting innocent blacks.</p>
<p>Media has to tell these lies otherwise people would see the truth.<br>

		<p>Hollywood is propaganda for liberalism in all its dimensions. Occasionally there is a Braveheart, or the movies based on Tolkien or C.S. Lewis. These are rare. Even if &#8220;race&#8221; is not involved in a movie, the characters are hardly typical of normal European-American families or values.  Read reviews, attend films sparingly. Try reading great literature. It still works.</p>

		<p>HBO has a current series called &#8220;True Blood,&#8221; about vampires living among humans. It is set in Louisiana and contains all the subtlety and nuance Hollywood is known for. </p>
<p>In the series, most humanoids are tolerant of the undead though somewhat cautious around them (old bigotries do die hard). Some humans - male and female - secretly lust after the vampires and go to great lengths to have sex with them. Often these people are the most bigoted vampire haters (there is that subtlety again).</p>
<p>There are a few outright bigots, centered around a charismatic (though, in an original twist, probably gay) televangelist. Vampires must endure signs that say &#8220;God Hates Fangs.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few vampires - bad apples no doubt - still kill humans but the real concern is the anti-vampire backlash that can occur when this happens.</p>
<p>The plot is so subtle that the show producers are forced to show photos of Klansmen (though not Black Panthers) and policemen beating blacks (though not blacks rioting and attacking whites) at the start of each show.</p>

		<p>In an interesting coincidence for me, I just watched a TV program here in Canada about how the Arctic was colonized by the Eskimos (Inuit). Starting a thousand years ago, a new aggressive style of Inuit called the Thule moved across the Canadian Arctic and overwhelmed and killed off the existing Dorset aboriginal people. There is also some evidence that fighting with the Thule helped end the Viking inhabitation in Greenland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to remember that whites are not always involved in ethnic/racial replacement.  </p>

		<p>Children of Men is a Sci Fi movie that had a conservative director?</p>
<p>The problem facing conservatives in the entertainment industry, is that in order to make their ideals palatable, to a public weened from birth on Marxist-like rhetoric, to appeal to them, a film must mirror some of the liberal trappings of the day. If this would be a surrender or not, who knows? You don&rsquo;t need to change your message, only the delivery. It&rsquo;s something &#8216;white nationalists&rsquo; should take into consideration when discussing their ideas. </p>

		<p>Found this:</p>
<p>Alive in Joburg is a science fiction short film directed by Neill Blomkamp, released in 2005 by Spy Films. It runs approximately six minutes long and was filmed in Johannesburg, South Africa. The film explores themes of apartheid, and is noted for its visual effects as well as its documentary-style imagery.</p>
<p>Blomkamp&rsquo;s 2009 feature film District 9 expands themes and elements from this short film.</p>
<p>In 1990, Johannesburg is home to a number of Extraterrestrial refugees, whose large spaceships (estimated to be nearly one kilometer in length) can be seen hovering above the city. When the visitors arrived, the human population was enamored with, among other aspects, the aliens&rsquo; advanced &#8220;bio-suits&#8221;, and supposedly welcomed them with open arms. However, later on, the aliens began moving into other areas of the city, committing crimes in order to survive, and frequently clashing with the police. The film goes on, playing as a documentary, complete with interviews and footage taken from handheld cameras, highlights the growing tension between the civilian population and the visitors, especially once the ships began to steal electricity and other natural resources from the city.</p>
<p>According to individuals &#8220;interviewed&#8221; in the film, the aliens were captive labor, forced to live in &#8220;conditions that were not good&#8221; and had escaped to Earth. As the film takes place in 1990, while Apartheid was still effect in South Africa, the aliens were forced to live amongst the already-oppressed black population, causing conflict with them as well as the non-white population. The theme of a race of oppressed alien beings escaping to a new planet, only to find even more oppression, is a similar theme explored in Alien Nation, in which a ship of alien slaves escaped and landed in Los Angeles In the early 1990s.</p>

		<p>This article is awfully presumptuous. The movie hasn&rsquo;t even come out and people are passing judgement on it without knowing its plot or the real meaning of the film. This is the exact same thing that religious fanatics do when they assume a movie will somehow blaspheme their religion and go out and protest a movie that they have never even seen. I think that Amren and it&rsquo;s readers should actually do some research of this film beyond just a viewing of the trailer. </p>
<p>Though this film is being distributed by Sony pictures, it is not a Hollywood movie. It is produced by Peter Jackson and directed by South African director Neil Blomkamp. Now you all know that Peter Jackson directed three of the finest pro European movies in the past decade, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Now if those films had been made by a Hollywood director, we could be almost certain that somehow minority actors would have been injected into the plot as protagonists, but that didn&rsquo;t happen. Jackson maintained the explicit message of Europeans united against the dark hordes of the south and eastern lands even amidst protests from the race hustlers&rsquo; cries of &#8220;racism&#8221;. I think that we should give Jackson and Blomkamp the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>You can watch Blomkamp&rsquo;s original short film, &#8220;District 9&#8221;, from which the feature length film was created. Notice that the film is much more complex than the above article would have you believe. It clearly shows aliens as a parallel for immigrants but but does not show them in a sympathetic light. It shows them as ugly, violent criminals looking to steal the resources of it&rsquo;s host country while spreading havoc and fear, juxtaposed against the ramblings of a liberal Afrikaner as he condemns the actions of the South Africans against them as bigotry and xenophobia. I think that Blomkamp leaves it up to the viewer to ponder the clear analogies that he lays out in the film. He never pushes a message. I think the film leans towards being clearly anti-immigrant and mocks the liberal viewpoint, but a liberal might see it another way. I think that the feature film will most likely take the same approach of moral ambiguity.</p>
<p>I think Amreners should pause and and not jump to any conclusions about this movie. You may find that it actually speaks to your cause.</p>
<p>Watch the short film here:</p>

		<p>Two of Hollywoods biggest white patriarchal stars, Clint Eastwood and Harrison Ford, disgraced their careers in the recent crop of pro-immigrant movies.  </p>
<p>Harrison starred in &#8216;Crossing Over&rsquo;. This movie portrays non-white immigrants as admirables full of hope, and whites as morally corrupt and conflicted.  The only &#8216;right&rsquo; choice presented is to be pro-immigrant.</p>
<p>Eastwood shames himself in &#8216;Gran Torino&rsquo;.  He plays a flawed man who, by the movie&rsquo;s climax, redeems his sins against non-whites by a Christ-like death. In his final gesture of capitulation, he hands the ownership of America (symbolized by his beloved American-built auto) over to a younger, morally superior immigrant, who drives off to a future without whites.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe these white men would lend their images as American icons to such blatant propaganda.   </p>

<p>I well remember the movie and TV series &#8220;Alien Nation,&#8221; although the propaganda aspect of same escaped me at the time. The plot of the series would have us believe that aliens came from vast numbers of light years away, and yet the only difference between them and the average white is that they had spots on their scalps instead of hair. They were productive in exactly the same percentages as humans and committed crimes in exactly the same percentages as humans. Any disapproval of them was purely irrational.</p>
<p>In the film District 9, the aliens are hideous and from what I can tell from the trailer look like giant insects. I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone wanting to be near such creatures. The film would also have us believe that aliens who are smart enough to master interstellar space travel, rather than being able to share their awesome technology with us, would instead have to &#8220;commit crimes in order to survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hollywood can invent facts in any way it wants to make a point.</p>

		<p>Last night I watched a new movie with Jackie Chan.<br>
It was a Chinese/Japanese production, and I read spanish subtitles.<br>
It was a catharsis.  Listening to Chinese and Japanese and reading spanish subtitles.  The movie was so good I don&rsquo;t care if I ever see another Hollywood production as long as I live.<br>
This is how Globalization could easily backfire on Hollywood.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the movie was about Immigration, and it was straight-forward and honest. Not a contrived, cookie-cutter anti-White male bore with wax-works posing as actors (has anyone seen moview like the one with Cuba Gooding Jr. or the really bad one with Val Kilmer? Unbelievably BAD!)</p>
<p>The Chan movie had its flaws, but the story was good, the pace quick, and the characters had depth, and damn if it wasn&rsquo;t a good movie. But above all, the Chinese and Japanese protrayed themselves pretty honestly. Since it was a mob picture they presented both sides as, well, mobsters. But there was an honesty and originality to it that was pretty impressive.<br>

		<p>  &#8220;a TV program here in Canada  shows how the Arctic was colonized by the Eskimos (Inuit). Starting a thousand years ago, a new aggressive style of Inuit called the Thule moved across the Canadian Arctic and overwhelmed and killed off the existing Dorset aboriginal people. <br>
There is also some evidence that fighting with the Thule helped end the Viking inhabitation in Greenland.  It&rsquo;s good to remember that whites are not always involved in ethnic/racial replacement.&#8221; <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Great!  Quite amazing that that is being shown!   And in Politically Correct Canada!</p>
<p>According to good PC doctrine, these gentle, peace-loving nature peoples all lived in harmony with nature and each other until greedy, capitalistic whites arrived and taught them violence, hatred, and war.  </p>
<p>So they were capable of doing some nastiness of their own after all!</p>

		<p>Just don&rsquo;t pay to watch the films. Reality is downloading and the web is having a massive impact on the film industry as much as the rest of the media. <br>
Last film I watched at the cinema was the anti-communist Polish film Katyn. Support, pay to watch and buy films like this and &#8216;The lives of Others&rsquo;. We do have our own media, you just have to have the will to support it.<br>
Even Hollywood has the occasional Blackhawk Down to see.<br>
The media war is one we must make progress on, the power of propaganda must never be underestimated.</p>

		<p>White Americans are influenced by the MSM to believe that their enemies are in the middle east, Iraq, Iran and Afganistan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got bad news for you. Try some truth and then do something about it:</p>
<p>Here is a list of the real enemies of white Americans, their long term survival and their way of life:</p>
<p>- American liberal government,<br>
- American liberal government agencies/departments,<br>
- American money powers (Big Business and banks) and the media run by them,<br>
- American film industry, Holleywood and all those liberal and decadent halfbreeds called stars and actors, which most of you so worship&hellip;<br>
- African Americans and other non-white aliens swarming to your country to become the enemy from within, whilst you white imbeciles are funding them and destroying yourselves financially. </p>
<p>America in conjunction with Britain and white Europe destroyed the only remaining civilized (read white) country on the African continent namely South Africa.<br>
They are going to do the same to you!</p>
<p>Have you never wondered why it is that in the midst of the Cold War, the only issue that the West and the East agreed upon and cooperated with one another, was that they both feverishly attemted to destroy white civilization in the Southern tip of Africa?</p>
<p>Some force is trying to wipe out Caucasions!<br>
You are next, unless you wake up!<br>
Beware, be aware and act timeously&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;One of the most pressing tasks confronting the Communist Party in the field of propaganda,&#8221; wrote  Comintern agent Willi Muenzenberg in a 1925 Daily Worker article, &#8220;is the conquest of this supremely important propaganda unit, until now the monopoly of the ruling class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Red Millionaire: A Political Biography of Willi Muenzenberg, Moscow&rsquo;s Secret Propaganda Tsar in the West, by Scan McMeekin; Yale University Press, 2003, about $60. </p>
<p>EVERYBODY SEEMS agreed that Willi Muenzenberg (1889-1940) was a genius. Arthur Koestler said it repeatedly. David Caute spoke of his &#8220;financial genius&#8221;, Stephen Koch of his &#8220;entrepreneurial genius&#8221;, Richard Krygier and Arnold Beichman of his &#8220;propaganda genius&#8221;. I did my bit too  &mdash;  describing him years ago as an &#8220;impresario of genius&#8221;. So after all that nonsense, it is a relief at last to read Sean McMeekin who says that, if Muenzenberg was any sort of genius at all, it was an evil genius. </p>
<p>He was certainly a master con man, but according to McMeekin in his new book The Red Millionaire, he was also a true believer. He supported the Revolution from 1917 to his death in 1940. From the famines and the forced collectivisation on to the slave camps, Muenzenberg was always there to defend the Kremlin and the Soviet Union. The Communist Party was his life. It gave him his luxury apartment in Berlin, his chauffeur, bodyguard and private barber. It put him into the Reichstag and bailed him out of all his financial disasters&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;1947/09 - HUAC subpoened 41 witnesses in an investigation of communism in Hollywood films - includes the &#8220;Hollywood 19&#8221; unfriendly witnesses (13 of 19 were writers) - &#8220;Hollywood 10&#8221; jailed for contempt - 84 of 204 supporters of the Hollywood 19 or 10 who signed amici curiae Supreme Court brief were blacklisted&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously there are still many &#8220;Red Millionaires&#8221; who continue to function in Hollywood.</p>

To Peter K (or is that Peter J *wink*; a nod to HAL being one letter from IBM):</p>
<p>I agree with you that we don&rsquo;t know the ending of the movie and therefore the ulterior motives of the aliens (and their coporate masters). Watching the original clip, it seems that these aliens are shock troops invading earth for the goal of overwhelming the earth population by an alien corporation. Again, this is pure assumption on my part. If true, Mr. Peter Jacksons&rsquo; message could be a warning about the flood of illegal aliens invading and destroying western nations for the sake of coporate profits.</p>
<p>Just as Presiden Reagans&rsquo; &#8216;one-time-only&rsquo; amnesty was nothing but a massive union busting sceme, so too might this movie be about the very real threat of illegal aliens being used by rich and powerful men in government and (alien) corporations to destroy western civilization using the pretext of &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; as a means to gain a foothold.</p>
<p>BTW, the space ships hoving over South Africa were also used in a book by Arthur C. Clarke called &#8220;Childhoods End&#8221;. Mr. Clarke also used the ships in his novel as a force to end apartheid. In the novel, the last man on earth was black.</p>
<p>And Mr. Jackson is to be commended for not caving to PC pressure and remaining true to Tolkens message. Well done, Mr, J (or K).<br>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, if aliens arrived on Earth, they would oppress all of us because obviously if they have the power and intelligence to get to our planet, then they could surely outmanuever us and conquer us.</p>

<p>They know exactly what they are doing and it has everything to do with logic, reason and purpose for THEIR vision, not yours.  The media is a powerful distributer of propaganda, and they are doing it in a cold, systematic way which the public willing sucks up (while making zillions at the same time).  And it&rsquo;s working.  How else could you make a people group (Whites) despise and turn against their own kind?</p>
<p>According to Merlin Miller:</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;Hollywood seeks to make European-Americans have deeply negative attitudes and beliefs toward their own people and their own culture. And it seeks to suppress the natural desire of European-Americans for a culture that promotes and sustains all of their highest ideals.<br>
 <br>
Hollywood has been insidiously propagandizing our people to believe non-truths, to worship anti-heroes, and to acquiesce to a world of increasing decadence and despair  &mdash;  a New World Order&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This sums up what Hollywood&rsquo;s main purpose and &#8216;message&rsquo; is to the masses  &mdash;  I would also add that Hollywood seeks to elevate non-Whites over Whites.</p>

		<p>The only scene that I liked from that godawful movie Independence Day was when all those lib airheads were standing on the top of that building underneath the massive alien ship, holding signs saying &#8216;Aliens Welcome&rsquo;and other such nonsense. The portal of the ship opens up with a blinding light, shining on the childlike smiling faces of the expectant multicults. This is it, Mommy is here! And proceeds to blow them off the face of the map. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this one will fly, just like the gay cowboy movie which was touted to exhaustion and still didn&rsquo;t break even, as far as I know. But life is not a movie and people are being treated to the real thing. Any scene with some humans holding hands with an alien will not likely have the effect the filmakers intended. </p>

<p>Hollywood has been rabidly anti White since the 1960s. If a decent movie somehow sneaks through or makes a ton of money like Lord of the Rings - these are just exceptions to the rule.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t whatever you do put any hope or trust into some fake Conservative Hollywood/TV hero, who isn&rsquo;t White racist at all, but is somehow presented as our hero/leader because he likes guns or is for certain wars in the Middle East, hates liberals etc.</p>
<p>Clint Eastwood - not our hero<br>
Ted Nuggent - No, 100 times no.<br>
Chuck Norris - &#8220;Walker Texas Ranger&#8221; &hellip; fights evil White racists like folks who read American Renaissance Magazine.</p>

		<p>Actually, this film might not be a covert (or blatant, as the case may be) goo-goo propaganda piece for Peace, Love and Understanding.  Instead of the extraterrestrials being overwhelmingly advanced and antagonistic, they&rsquo;re borderline helpless survivors and abjectly at the mercy of Earth&rsquo;s inhabitants.  It could turn out to be an interesting SF flick. Not having seen the film and going only by the following plot summary from Wikipedia, it could be the film&rsquo;s thesis focuses more on intractable problems and how they are dealt with.  I can see possibilities. </p>
<p>Since they&rsquo;re evidently capable of extra-solar system travel, implying they possess extremely advanced engineering skills, maybe the aliens could establish themselves on Mars, transforming it into a livable habituate, with the assistance of the governments of Earth.  And since they&rsquo;d no doubt succeed, then all of Earth&rsquo;s surly blacks and revanchist Mexicans could be sent there as part of the assistance deal. </p>
<p>Somehow I think that&rsquo;s not going to be the take away message, though. It could very well be a variation on the theme of the Constant Gardener, which I couldn&rsquo;t suffer through in its entirety, but got the general idea nonetheless.</p>

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neill_Blomkamp)</p>
<p>Plot<br>
District 9 is based on Alive in Joburg, a short film directed by Neill Blomkamp, Sharlto Copley, Simon Hansen and Shanon Worley. Copley also portrayed one of the interviewed policemen. The short film is about aliens landing in South Africa and becoming confined to a specific area and forced to work.</p>
<p>In the movie, aliens make first contact with Earth twenty-eight years prior while humanity waited for the hostile attack or for giant advances in technology, though neither came. Instead, the aliens that arrived were refugees; the last survivors of their home world. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa&rsquo;s District 9 as the world&rsquo;s nations argued over what to do with them. Patience over the alien situation ran out and control over them was contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company uninterested in the aliens&rsquo; welfare. MNU stood to receive tremendous profits if they can make the aliens&rsquo; advanced weaponry work.</p>
<p>MNU, thus far, have failed in making the alien weaponry work as activation of the weaponry requires alien DNA. Tension between the aliens and the humans comes to a head when an MNU field operative, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), contracts a mysterious virus that begins changing his DNA. Wikus quickly becomes the most hunted man in the world, as well as the most valuable, as he is the key to unlocking the secrets of alien technology. van der Merwe becomes ostracized and friendless and comes to hide in District 9.<br>

		<p>Todays Hollywood is essentially a culture consisting of every kind of perversion imaginable. They have been making less and less films in the U.S. and therefore contributing less and less taxes. All the Hollywood perverts are good for is creating and endless amount of social problems for American citizens, whom they have no interest in whatever, outside of them buying a movie ticket. They never have to live with the consquences of the things they push like illegal immigration. They should be boycotted. Americans don&rsquo;t really know how much they harm this nation.</p>

Why would these obviously advanced aliens, with these enormous spaceships, be forced to live in poor conditions?

		<p>Aliens and non-white immigration:  the metaphor doesn&rsquo;t work, really.  All humans share the same ecological niche, thus when you put different ethnicities together they compete for the same resources.  With distinctly inhuman aliens like these, it&rsquo;s unlikely that anything other than economic relationships would be possible:  basically, once the initial fear wore off, humans and crustacean-aliens would ignore each other, except maybe for trade.  Even if &#8220;equal rights&#8221; were provided for the shrimp-people, I doubt that would be nearly as disruptive as attempts to accomodate Muslims and blacks in the West.  </p>
<p>The aliens would eventually become viewed as something on the order of &#8220;animals that can talk,&#8221; albeit with considerably more rights than regular animals.  They also wouldn&rsquo;t find humans any more attractive than humans find them, and in any case genetics would definitely prevent &#8220;race-mixing.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the aliens were the near-human sort featured on Star Trek, then mass-immigration by them would create the same problems as non-Western immigration currently does.</p>

Most people, whose eyes haven&rsquo;t been opened, simply don&rsquo;t see the world in the same light as we who read Amren and who have devoted conscious thought to the subject.    Most are baffled by what&rsquo;s going on around them, but don&rsquo;t put two and two together. Most haven&rsquo;t really thought about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving these stars the benefit of the doubt, but it&rsquo;s possible they don&rsquo;t have even a clue.</p>
<p>After all, Hollywood millionaires aren&rsquo;t subjected to the same daily experiences as the rest of us   &mdash;   the annoying, degrading, frustrating,  elbow-bumping encounters   &mdash;    and thus  they aren&rsquo;t likely to have had the same eye-opening epiphanies  that we have had &hellip; as recounted by so many in &#8220;How I Saw the Light&#8221;.  Perhaps these celebrities just haven&rsquo;t had the occasion or need to see the light.</p>

		<p>Noob pursues this line of thought very logically, and makes a very good point, from a biological perspective. We don&rsquo;t share the same ecological niche, and therefore we would not be competitive for the same resources.  Nor would we find each other attractive or be inclined (or even able) to inter-breed.</p>
<p>The whole story is kind of silly. But the analogy to our present-day problem with aliens (human aliens) is what is interesting. And highly relevant.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how all of our (human) rights would be applicable to aliens. Also there is the possibility of their common cold wiping us out as Cortez accidentally did to the Aztecs (or vice versa), hence why separation wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Another movie is Race To Witch Mountain, staring two blond kids as aliens and the mixed race Dwayne &#8220;The Rock&#8221; Johnson who tries to save the aliens from the government.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Eastwood shames himself in &lsquo;Gran Torino&rsquo;. He plays a flawed man who, by the movie&rsquo;s climax, redeems his sins against non-whites by a Christ-like death. In his final gesture of capitulation, he hands the ownership of America (symbolized by his beloved American-built auto) over to a younger, morally superior immigrant, who drives off to a future without whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>I seldom go to the movies, but the last movie I saw was &#8216;Gran Torino&rsquo;, because I quite like Clint Eastwood -  his &#8216;Dirty Harry&rsquo; movies are amongst my favourites.</p>
<p>I found &#8216;Gran Torino&rsquo; a puzzling affair in the following ways;<br>
1) He&rsquo;s obviously angry at the degredation of his neighbourhood.<br>
2) He&rsquo;s annoyed at the influx of Hmongs, yet after a brief peroid of semi-hostility, he&rsquo;s willing to socialise with them - if I was him, I&rsquo;d rater sit on the verandah with my trusty dog and a beer or two.<br>
3) He actually hates his family; his sons, his sons&rsquo;wives (he hates them even more when they try to be nice to him&hellip;) and his grandchildren (they are particularly sub-standard) so much so, that he &#8216;semi-adopts&rsquo;, or takes under his wing, the son and daughter from next door.<br>
4) I was revolted by the Hmong gang and their treatment of Clint&rsquo;s adopted son and daughter, but seriously people, would you martyr yourself for them, when they have an entire community that can deal with their own, revolting as they may be, rather than one lone OLD white man taking it upon himself to do so?<br>
5) Leaving the big ol&rsquo; car to Tao - OK, he&rsquo;s a good kid, but what about your family&hellip;you know, your family! </p>
<p>I could go on, but it&rsquo;s a lovely sunny afternoon.<br>
Time for a BBQ!<br>

<p>Great post browser.</p>
<p>Though you could be right about some celebrities, the movie studios certainly know what they are up to. And not just the movie studios.</p>
<p>Still, in my view, I think the celebrities know too; they just don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I worked for ten years in the hotel business in NYC. <br>
The two worlds you mentioned in your post were laid out before me on a daily basis. Because of the particular job I had I spoke every day with the rich and famous in music, movies, tv, sports and media, and it&rsquo;s true, ie; the simply live on another planet.<br>
It really hit me one day when a colleague showed me the phone bill of a famous singer (minus his band) and his manager and accountant.  The three of them were there for a week.  <br>
When I looked at the bill I joked with my co-worker (who was a woman).  I asked her if she was giving me her phone number.<br>
She laughed and said, &#8220;No, it&rsquo;s not a phone number, it&rsquo;s a phone bill.&#8221;<br>
They are pampered beyond belief, spoiled rotten, and were very used to it and wanted it to keep coming. <br>
It&rsquo;s all implied that they have bosses and will do what they want. Except for maybe one or two rock stars who answered to themselves but were still driven by a desire to STAY famous.</p>
<p>Also, they are not just insular and bubble-headed, they are also all together on their Celebrity Island (which includes their managers, accountants, lawyers, agents, etc, etc.)</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a two way street.  No fans, No celebrities.<br>
After September 11th Conan O&rsquo;Brien said that he thought it was amazing that people wanted to know what celebrities thought about the tragedy. He said it was both strange and ridiculous, adding, &#8220;In the 19th century celebrities weren&rsquo;t celebrities, they were entertainers, nothing more.  We should go back to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, I think we are, sooner than later too. <br>

<p>&#8220;Todays Hollywood is essentially a culture consisting of every kind of perversion imaginable. They have been making less and less films in the U.S. and therefore contributing less and less taxes. All the Hollywood perverts are good for is creating and endless amount of social problems for American citizens, whom they have no interest in whatever, outside of them buying a movie ticket. They never have to live with the consquences of the things they push like illegal immigration. They should be boycotted. Americans don&rsquo;t really know how much they harm this nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby, this is the truth.  Thank you for stating it so concisely. </p>
<p>These people have the &#8220;god&#8221; complex.  They trapse about the world, partying, being annoyed when they get a little tired of attention and pretending to care about people by walking through the most troubled neighborhoods in the world and tossing a favor out here and there, or &#8220;working&#8221; to bring an end to - pick your issue.  It allows them to feel virtuous and superior.  What would really be heroic might be supporting their own people - homeless veterans for example.  But it is not just the actors, it is the business in general that prostitutes itself to every popular issue with sexual and emotional gratification combined with a sort of path to self-satisfication through the illusion of virtuousity.  </p>
<p>Third world people must wait breathless as the Brangelinas and Bonos of the world arrive - to see who wins the adoption lottery next.  We &#8220;Average Americans&#8221; are just too mundane and boring.  We are only good for buying tickets to the next ego parade on screen.  And as you say, we are stuck with the consequences of the social experiments they project onto us through movies. </p>
<p>I have been boycotting the movie theater for years now.  I just added television.  I pick what I bring into my home and what I want to view for entertainment.  But I can report that it is virtually impossible to watch ANY movie made since about 1990 without some sort of PC or One World, Multicult message in it.  Even a great film like &#8220;The English Patient&#8221; has to have the nurse character fall for a Seik when less than one hundred years earlier Seiks mass murdered, wholesale - British women and children during the India Mutiny.  It was written into the story just for interracial titillation as it adds nothing to the story.  He lover could have been White and there would have been no difference to the plot.  </p>
<p>So mostly, I am interested in early Hollywood films, those made up to about 1970 or so with a few exceptions, such as Gladiator, or Saving Private Ryan.  I have discoverd the silent film world and how really interesting silent films can be.  One must be picky.  I can&rsquo;t imagine how parents can have much control over the brainwashing of their children through movies and media these days.  But that is where our struggle lies for the moment; trying to control the effect of media on our conscious and the conscious of our children without being arrested for it. So it must be done though intellectual argument such as is done on the Amren posting boards (thank you Amren).  Hopefully, many people reading the posts find encouragement and ideas for combating the overwhelming forces against our racial and ethnic survival.<br>

		<p>Sci-Fi is a very difficult genre to figure out normally, and once one is reading into it, it becomes all the more difficult to interpret 100% accurately. For example, take the zombie trilogies of &ldquo;Night of the Living Dead&ldquo;  &mdash;  1968; through the &ldquo;Day of the Dead&rdquo;  &mdash;  1985 by George A. Romero and you get my meaning. Ironically, it was the &ldquo;Night of the Living Dead&rdquo; (1968) and its two sequels (&ldquo;Dawn of the Dead&rdquo; 1978 and &ldquo;Day of the Dead&rdquo; 1985) that captured a more realistic vision of the problems of a mindlessly shambling invader population; and its impact on a more advanced, but also inexplicably stifled population of humans. In all three films (which their creator Comrade Romero has openly admitted in many interviews,) was to point out how a lesser &ldquo;countercultural&rdquo; population might overrun a more established and superior one. Mind you, this man is no mossback or even a wet Troy; he is a typical &ldquo;creative&rdquo; Marxist, who enjoys &ldquo;sticking it to the man.&rdquo; His original vision, was that the shambling and neo-retarded retro zombies (laughable, when you really think about it) in his films would portray the hippies of his generation, and their inevitable conquest of the &ldquo;entrenched reactionary&rdquo; American sociopolitical &ldquo;monolith&rdquo; of the 50s. What he missed, was that those ravenous reanimated corpses might also portray the Third World&rsquo;s minions, and the ever desperate humans (particularly, the ones that take a logical approach to the ghouls) might represent a West fighting them back inefficiently. Or put another way, if the humans could only act sooner and rationally, they might win in the end; or at least gain a stalemate. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbONVqZUbYw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbONVqZUbYw</a> Do you see how desperate and bizarre that trailer is, and is it not, at its core, eerily like the same in regard to the real world &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; zombies &ldquo;of color&rdquo; that now &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; us as a country and a civilization?

		<p>Those pampered, spoiled celebrities that Dedalus mentioned   &mdash;   the ones that the masses adulate  and put on a pedestal   &mdash;    are all part of the vast entertainment machine that keeps us distracted, pacified, hypnotized, and in our place.  Thus, they are part of the problem and are agents for &#8220;the enemy&#8221;.  And, as Dedalus also said   &mdash;    no one exists alone   &mdash;   they all have bosses and must do what it takes to please them  &hellip; that is, if they wish to retain their celebrity status and keep getting all of that heady celebrity treatment.</p>
<p>Stars are made, not born.  And they can be un-made.  If anyone were to stray too far out of line, they would instantly become a non-person and would never be seen or heard in the public forum again.  The whole media industry would either turn on them, or just forget they ever existed.   That would be the end of the celebrity treatment and all of the lush perks that go with it. No doubt that&rsquo;s a very effective way to ensure their cooperation and keep them &#8220;behaving&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Well, District 9 is total Science Fiction.  Wanna know how I know?  Because in real life, our governments would be preoccupied with forcing humans to interact with the non-humans.  We&rsquo;d have Alien Amnesty laws.  We&rsquo;d have whole bureaucracies devoted to Alien assimilation, and prosecution of humans who discriminated against them.</p>
<p>All the best jobs would go to Aliens&hellip;.first, because they&rsquo;d work cheaper&hellip;.later, because of a quota system, and their Protected Minority status.  They&rsquo;d be voters in no time, and politicians would pander shamelessly to them.</p>
<p>The United Nations would see the Alien influx as the ideal moment to dissolve national sovereignty and institute the single world government.  Care for the Aliens would be a &#8216;world issue&rsquo;, with the only &#8216;solution&rsquo; being that the United Nations be allowed to directly tax each human on Earth.  Considering that the UN will soon have the GPS coordinates for all our front doors, this is less a stretch than one might think.</p>

<p>I would disagree about the zombie movies. All three have a black man who ends up being the hero at the end. In at least one of the movies, getting the girl. I would have to say, when you get to the end of the movie, you suspect that this state of affairs is in fact the cause of the zombie infestation. </p>
<p>In the second of the triligy, Dawn of the Dead, besides filming the problem beginning in the inner-city, the movie really plays up the difference between the white (could get the girl) hero character, and the black (gets the girl) hero character. The black guy is the hero, at least he lives. The black guy is cool, human, and hip, while the white guy is oblivious and obsessed with getting the job done.</p>
<p>Even AmRen began one one of their conferences by saying something like, &#8220;it&rsquo;s great to be among the living again&#8221;, as opposed to being among those who are asleep, or brain dead, I suppose.</p>

		<p>Peter K says that Amreners might be jumping the gun on this one. No, they&rsquo;re not. Look into Mr. Blomkamp&rsquo;s background. He&rsquo;s just another of the droves of well connected, anti-white hacks that populate and control Hollywood when it comes to what&rsquo;s served up in order to tell the public what and how to think. Go ahead, use Google and some other search engine to see for yourself. When you see phrases like &#8220;&hellip; plucked out of nowhere,&#8221; to describe guys like Blomkamp, then you know he&rsquo;s actually connected and of the right stripe, political and otherwise. Take a look at his &#8216;work&rsquo; and the publications that have focused on him. He was a hack illustrator, and anti-white in many of his ventures. Like Tim Wise, at home and with family and friends, he doesn&rsquo;t really consider himself white. </p>

		<p>One positive thing about this is,it may make people more aware of creeping sharia and of what the result of sharia law in the Western World would mean. What better description of dhimmi status than the laws the non-humans had to live under?</p>

		<p>Wanna know how I know? Because in real life, our governments would be preoccupied with forcing humans to interact with the non-humans.</p>
<p>And of course, some stupid college White girl would want to have sex with them.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t own a television and almost never go to a movie theater.  I might watch a movie (usually these days over the internet) about five times a year.  What really stands out is how the anti-white propaganda has ratcheted up in the decades since I was a regular viewer.  There&rsquo;s always some gratiutious little side plot whose sole purpose is to show you some nasty rural gun toting racist white crackers, just so you know what a &#8220;domestic terrorist&#8221; looks like.  In the main plot the incompetent screw up is always a white man.  The capable man of authority is always black, and gets the blonde heroine.  The scripts could have been written by Tim Wise, and the movies produced by the SPLC.</p>

		<p>      Remember the Telawits from the Outer Limits? They came to<br>
Earth to help Man. They started taking people on &#8220;cruises&#8221; to  their plantet; the only problem being that nobody ever came back. Their book, &#8220;How to Serve Man&#8221; when translated, turned out<br>
to be a cookbook. </p>
