<h1>Black Officer at Scholar&rsquo;s Home Supports Arrest</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Salsberg, AP, July 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A black police officer who was at Henry Louis Gates Jr.&rsquo;s home when the black Harvard scholar was arrested says he fully supports how his white fellow officer handled the situation.</p>
<p>Sgt. Leon Lashley says Gates was probably tired and surprised when Sgt. James Crowley demanded identification from him as officers investigated a report of a burglary. Lashley says Gates&rsquo; reaction to Crowley was &#8220;a little bit stranger than it should have been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if Gates should have been arrested, Lashley said supported Crowley &#8220;100 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP&rsquo;s earlier story is below.</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)  &mdash;  A multiracial group of police officers on Friday stood with the white officer who arrested a prominent black Harvard scholar and asked President Barack Obama and Gov. Deval Patrick to apologize for comments the union leaders called insulting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dennis O&rsquo;Connor, president of the Cambridge Police Superior Officers Association, said Obama&rsquo;s remarks were &#8220;misdirected&#8221; and the Cambridge police &#8220;deeply resent the implication&#8221; that race was a factor in the arrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Obama said the actions of the CPD were stupid and linked the event to the history of racial profiling in America,&#8221; O&rsquo;Connor said. &#8220;The facts of the case suggested that the president used the right adjective but directed it to the wrong party.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Black studies cherish the accomplishment of victimhood. </p>
<p>This case illustrates a short phrase I like, &#8220;expert coward&#8221;. <br>
Here is the pattern often followed :<br>
1st   Taunting the police <br>
2nd   Receiving forceful response<br>
3rd   Claiming righteous indignation at an injustice served<br>
4th   Getting sympathy from higher authority (thanks Mr. Obama)<br>

		<p>How dare that white policeman not recognize Henry Louis Gates?  Doesn&rsquo;t that slob know that Gates is a STAR!!  How insulting to be asked for identification.  Gates teaches at Harvard and is Black.  But, this puny, low white cop demanding to know who Gates is!  Incredible.  So Gates exploded into a tantrum.<br>
   And then President Obama chirped in about the stupid police, racial profiling, and how the percentage of Blacks stopped by police is higher than whites. Clearly, Obama thought white racism was the heart of the story.<br>
   But the white policeman had tried to save a Black athlete using mouth to mouth.  The athlete was already dead -performing mouth to mouth on a dead man.  A Black man.  I suspect there are Blacks who would not want that job.  Perhaps even Prof. Gates.  But Gates yelled that the officer was a racist.  And Pres. Obama called the officer stupid.  Stupid white racists.<br>
   But this officer, who teaches classes in how to avoid racial profiling, and who sought to save a Black athlete using m to m, is hardly the typical racist.  But to Gates and Obama, all  whites are racists.  That is what is taught at Harvard, and taught at Yale, and taught throughout academia.  That is what they believe.  So when a white officer asks for information and cooperation, Gates threw a tantrum.  Perhaps, Gates even has a &#8220;kill the Snitch&#8221; t-shirt.  Perhaps not.  But he was unwilling to cooperate with a low-level policeman who had been called to inquire about a possible burglary of Gates&rsquo; home.  As far as the officer knew, Gates could have been a burglar.  There were burglaries in the neighborhood.  The neighbor thought Blacks were breaking in.  And most street criminals just happen to be Black.  That is simply criminal profiling.  But academics want to pretend that Blacks are NOT disproportionately involved in crime.  Is is because Blacks are so often involved in crime that they may be stopped by police more often.<br>
    Bottom line, when Gates and Obama accused this officer of being racist, they were accusing all whites of being racist.  And the particular officer in this case was one least likely to be a white racist.  He was smeared.  Smeared by two racists, two Black racists, Prof. Gates and Pres. Obama.  &mdash;    &mdash;  Hugh Murray</p>

<p>Thanks, RandyB, for a great observation!  Oh, god, that&rsquo;s good! In just two terse sentences, you&rsquo;ve summed it up beautifully. Nowadays, it&rsquo;s necessary to have black endorsement to make any opinion legit.  Whites standing alone, on any issue,  would be just &#8220;racists&#8221;, not worthy of hearing. </p>
<p>And &#8220;Af-Ams&#8221; is a great term too.  I&rsquo;ll have to remember that one. I&rsquo;ve gotten tired of having to write out the long, pompous, now-compulsory, &#8220;African-American&#8221; word-of-the-day.  When they phase that one out to replace it with the newest permissible term, I hope they choose a shorter one next time.  It&rsquo;s getting hard for an old codger like me to keep up with all these trendy revisions of our language.</p>

		<p>Officer Lashley is an honest man, and also discreet, for it&rsquo;s a certainty that he softened what Gates&rsquo;s reaction actually was when he said,&#8221; It was,&#8221;a little bit stranger than it should have been.&#8221; He&rsquo;s telling us right here, that Gates went berserk to reasonable questioning.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s absolutely ridiculous that Obama is even involved in this farce. Is this how&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s going to be during his term? Every time some high-profile black gets in trouble, they go run to the president of the country and he proceeds to make half-baked statements after the fact? </p>

		<p>Once again black solidarity and the circling of the wagons is in full force for all to see. Watching and listening to the talk show&rsquo;s on radio and TV just about every black came to the defense of this Skip Gates character, including high ranking retired black police official&rsquo;s. This is almost totally across the board, lower class, middle class, and upper middle class. White middle and upper middle classes for the most part supported the cop. Of course some of the elite white&rsquo;s came to the defense of Gates. This just proves without a doubt that in any controversy involving black&rsquo;s race will win out each and evey time. Nothing else seems to matter with them, blood is always thicker than water.</p>

<p>Well, we can all rest easy now. </p>
<p>Irrefutable eye witnesses&hellip;&hellip;..8 civilians and two cops&hellip;&hellip;.were not enough validation to counter this dimwitted  black&rsquo;s unfounded claim of racism. It requires a black eye witness to authenticate the cop&rsquo;s story.  </p>
<p>Recordings in addition to the eye witnesses are not enough either.  One black eye witness to report what happened, is far better than 10 white people and audio verification.</p>
<p>Talk show hosts should take this oportunity to elaborate on the incredibly high crime rates among blacks, which are responsible for profiling in the first place. They should point out that since blacks won&rsquo;t police their own people, they&rsquo;re going to continue to be profiled, and doing anything else by the police will mean criminals won&rsquo;t be caught and prosecuted for their crimes. </p>
<p>It should also be pointed out many times that, instead of policing themselves and calling for less crime in their neighborhoods, blacks complain that too many of them are going to jail or they excuse black criminal conduct with more of their dumb, flimsy excuses.</p>
<p>Any profiling going on is the result of black failure to control their people, so the police have to do it. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that Africa, and black run governments in this country, wind up in shambles with crime everywhere.  Blacks are their own worst enemies, and if we continue to wait, be prepared, and continue keeping an eye on this deteriorating situation, we&rsquo;re going to see them implode at some point.  When it happens, it will be due to dumb tactics they always use which they think are effective.</p>
<p>To those who think &#8220;Worse is better,&#8221; this situation is almost on a par with the O.J. acquittal.  It&rsquo;s right up front and outrageous where everyone can see it.<br>

		<p>Obamas time would be better served providing the jobs his farce of a stimulus promised us!  What we&rsquo;re the horror stories he projected if it didn&rsquo;t pass?  We are DOUBLE that now!<br>
  As far as that arrogant race baiter Gates goes, he was just acting out like very other ignorant black in the U.S. and playing the part of the professional victim.  The only stupid idiot in the encounter was Gates himself.  All he had to do was show the officer his Identification, nothing more.  I&rsquo;m sure the officer would have told him about the phone call and apologized, END OF STORY!  Gates is an typical example of the lunatic fringe that supports Obama.</p>

Also, brother &#8220;Browser&#8221;, why do you feel the need to &#8216;keep up&rsquo; with what blacks want to be called. Do they try to keep up on anything WE want? Do they even care? You see what I mean? I make it a point to ALWAYS say\write &#8216;black&rsquo;, if they don&rsquo;t like it, too bad. I&rsquo;ve never had any of them say anything to me about it.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t restricted to blacks, it&rsquo;s restricted to non-whites in general.  Anyone but whites can lay claim to this.</p>
<p>It goes hand in hand with the unspoken assertion that all non-whites know precisely what it&rsquo;s like to be white.</p>
<p>More practically, it&rsquo;s just another way of playing the race card.  Once I was pulled over and made to sit on the curb next to my car for half an hour because I &#8220;matched a description of a race suspect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being white means I don&rsquo;t get to play the race card and pretend what was happened was all down to race.  I just had to suck it up and move on.  I actually laughed once the officer explained why he was doing what he was doing.  I suppose if I was non-white I could have made a federal case out of the whole thing.</p>
<p>White guilt is what perpetuates this.  If every white would fight this, it would disappear rapidly.  All we have to do is turn it back around and say, &#8220;oh, but you know precisely what it&rsquo;s like to be white, right?  This is where I&rsquo;m supposed to nod solemnly and agree with your &#8216;narrative,&rsquo; but that&rsquo;s not going to happen.  Instead, this is where I tell you I have a story too, and you don&rsquo;t have a clue what it&rsquo;s like to walk in a white man&rsquo;s shoes.&#8221;  Even racially neutered whites like officer Crowley can pull this off without wandering off the plantation.</p>

<p><br>
Of course!   Blacks complain that too many of them are stopped and questioned, too many blacks are arrested, too many blacks are in prison. </p>
<p>On the other hand, they complain that crime is rampant in their communities and that they receive inadequate  police protection.</p>
<p>Well, what racial element do they think is committing those crimes in the black communities?  Are white people coming into their neighborhoods with the purpose of burglarizing, robbing and raping them?    </p>
<p>Still  (as with tests and employment) they are obsessed with having  all the numbers come out equal;  unequal numbers imply discrimination. This is based on the [false] assumption that all races are exactly equal, therefore the outcomes should be equal.  If fewer whites are in prison, it must be because of white racism.   So they demand that blacks and whites should be  stopped, arrested,  incarcerated in EQUAL numbers to show that there is no discrimination going on!   That is irrational.  It is not reality. They are impossible to satisfy!</p>

Cops versus race: Hmmm.<br>
It&rsquo;s interesting to see, in this case, where two groups, each with a strong sense of group solidarity have clashed.   Deracinated American whites no longer have any sense of identity or solidarity, but at least cops do. </p>
<p>Cops stick together and blacks stick together.  Each have their own self-interest organizations.   So  now you have the Blue Wall confronting the &#8220;Black&#8221; Wall.    Interesting to see how it breaks down and who will win.   </p>
<p>Blacks have the mayor, the governor, the attorney general, and the president all on their side, as well as a sympathetic media and academia, in addition to the enormous power of the government.   The white cops have what?   If I were betting, I&rsquo;d place my money on the blacks. </p>

<p>I think the answer to the riddle of the vicious cycle you describe, that is between complaining about profiling/too many black men in prison, and complaining about crime, is that many blacks assume that whites sprinkle themselves with some sort of animist magic that makes them behave for the most part without much need for prison space.  All they want is for us to sprinkle some of that magic on them.</p>

		<p>Gates makes his living trumping up racism allegations. Yet far from being oppressed, his skin color has been an affirmative action jackpot for him. An actual incident in his privileged life would be mighty convenient for him to point to. The emerging truth, however, raises the question of whether all Professor Gates&rsquo; &#8220;examples&#8221; of so-called racism are this ridiculous.</p>

		<p>The only one that did racial profiling in this case - perhaps besides the original caller who had a darn valid point about two black men trying to pry open a door - was Gates.  Do blacks forget that judging people on the color of their skin works both ways?  Also, they need to reflect on why there is so much bad blood between the police and the black community.  Not all of it - in fact, I would venture to say most of it - has nothing to do with rogue cops or poorly-trained cops.  Blacks have a history of disrespecting authority, they have a culture that defends thuggery, they are quick to claim racism when they see white skin or any other skin color except black, and whites have a genuinely-justified distrust of them.  The only conversation they want to have about race is one with whites apologizing and giving them more handouts.  Whites want a conversation about race that will finally tell blacks that they are at fault for most of their own troubles and that they should thank their lucky stars that white Americans, by and large, are a good, although sometimes foolish, people.  We will never transcend race is this country and it is about time that both sides admit it.  Never&hellip; ever.<br>

		<p>Gates is a professor of &#8220;Black Studies&#8221; at Harvard - a completely bogus academic field perpetuated there, and at other colleges and universities to further knee-jerk affirmative action simply to assuage liberal guilt regarding faculty membership.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what &#8220;Black Studies&#8221; is, or what useful function in public life it will ever prepare anyone for - except of course yet more Black Studies &#8220;teaching&#8221; jobs?</p>
<p>If &#8220;Black Studies&#8221; is in fact a valid course of study, why are there no White Studies? (a majority of the population), or Asian Studies? or Hispanic Studies? or East Indian Studies?</p>
<p>- Because such racial &#8220;studies&#8221; would make an embarrassing farce out of any learning institution&rsquo;s curriculum - as is already the case at Harvard with &#8220;Black Studies.&#8221; </p>
<p>If Gate&rsquo;s hysterical reaction to a white police officer doing his duty is any indication, all Gates has taught himself (and probably others) is race prejudice.  </p>

		<p>There was no profiling going on here   &mdash;    except that done by this hyper-sensitive,  race-obsessed professor, in assuming that all whites are racists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Profiling&#8221; means operating on stereotypes and making assumptions about people.</p>
<p>But contrary to Gates&rsquo; assumption, the police did not question him because he was black, nor did they assume that because he was black he must be a burglar. In fact, they did not assume ANYTHING.  They were sent there on information provided by a witness who had seen two BLACK men forcing the door of the house. This was no mere assumption on their part,  and thus it was not profiling.</p>
<p>The only one jumping to a hasty  (and false) conclusion in this matter was Gates.  He was the one doing the &#8220;profiling&#8221;.</p>

		<p>the obamanation believes that there is along standing issue w/ minority&rsquo;s being disproportionaly being stopped by law inforcement [racial profiling?]. I wonder if he can explain why 13% of the population is responsible for 50% of the crime in this country.Take away the black &amp; hispanic &amp; illegal immagrant crime &amp; this country&rsquo;s crime rate would almost be non-exsistant. Surely the exalted one is bright enought to realize that?</p>

		<p>Gates is a quota black who has ridden the affirmative action bus for so long he feels like &#8220;black superman.&#8221;  He was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple.</p>
<p>Gate is what he is because of white guilt; he never had to earn anything, just be present.</p>
<p>No black, no brown will ever see whites as deserving of justice, or deserving.  Put it down in your journal.</p>
<p>When whites become the minority I suggest a move to another galaxy.</p>

The only stupid idiot in the encounter was Gates himself. All he had to do was show the officer his Identification, nothing more.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree.  OR&hellip;if he had to grumble a bit about the matter he could have done so within the limits of rational complaining.  Instead he goes into a hysterical raving like a common urban thug whose head is filled with rap lyrics denigrating whites, women, the police, making certain to let everyone know he wants to &#8220;off&#8221; them all.  </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s another black studies &#8220;scholar.&#8221; (Don&rsquo;t you just love to hear that someone who couldn&rsquo;t compete intellectually with a good number of white janitors is a &#8220;scholar?&#8221;)  It irks me no end.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s with the W.E. Dubois section.  The I.Q. average of the entire department will barely equal the white group I.Q. average of 100, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say.  It&rsquo;s very likely that some could be even lower than that.</p>
<p>When asked to go outside because his shouting was interferring with the police radio messages, he replied to the cop, Yo mama can go outside!&#8221;  Also during his complaint he said that &#8220;you don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re messing with.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Yo mama.  Messing with.&#8221;  Both are black jive talk terms usually reserved for uneducated lower echelon black thugs.  This is the &#8220;scholar&#8221; the far left MSM labels him.  And, it&rsquo;s  a direct reflection on Harvard, and places them in a bad light.  They show us by example that far from being some kind of elite school they&rsquo;re really nothing more than a spot where ghetto malcontents congregate. </p>
<p>On the Drudge report today this poor fool was quoted in an article as saying that this incident is great for bringing to light racial profiling. That everyone beyond a retard who reads about the incident knows right away that profiling doesn&rsquo;t even remotely enter into the picture, but he&rsquo;s so unintelligent he thinks it does.  </p>
<p>What this tells most of us is that unreasonable black conduct, harsh racist denunciations, and unjust black claims of injustice, speaks volumes to most white people, who are not the PC brainwashed types, about the lack of intelligence of those who are supposed to represent more intelligent blacks.  He has shown us by example that he&rsquo;s really no different than the vast majority who live in the ghettoes.</p>
<p>I wrote him an email and laid out what most whites think of him and the entire incident.  His email is: hgates@fas.harvard.edu<br>
I hope I provoked him enough to get him to enter into a debate via email, then post his comments for everyone to see, but I doubt if he will respond.  I kept the discourse civil.</p>

		<p>It all comes back to Rodney King. Its all about blacks, and what blacks want, and what can be set aside to &#8220;Apologize&#8221; for the slavery and segregation. It takes a dog less time to forgive its owner after being punished, black people still are self righteous and unforgiving. Rodney King stands as an example.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s great this is happening; but highly unfortunate that the blackness of the officers is the only thing that makes their opinions credible.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re missing the point here. It&rsquo;s not the officer&rsquo;s blackness per se, but the fact that he happens to be of the same background as Dr. Gates, who in this case is crying &#8220;racism.&#8221; By siding with his fellow officers, the black officer is arguably acting against the interests of his own race, and it is this that makes his position credible.</p>

		<p>I think Obama did some racial profiling, too.  I analyzed his words like a black would.  He used code words.  He invited Crowley and Gates to the White House for a &#8220;beer.&#8221;  Code word for Crowley aka &#8220;Joe Six-Pack.&#8221;  He can&rsquo;t fool me.<br>

<p>Sounds like cops sticking together trumps race, at least in this case.<br>
In the long term, I&rsquo;m not sure whether this is good or bad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I concur; the fact that this individual got loud or obnoxious is secondary to the fact that his property was not respected, and that the power of the State, in the person of a paid public official, trumped the right of a private citizen to control his own destiny. </p>
<p>Everyone, especially here, should always weigh the weight of tyranny, with the scales of individual liberty.</p>

		<p>Deval Patrick should be repeatedly hammered over his racist black stereotype mouthing off. &#8220;Every black man&rsquo;s nightmare&#8221;. Yeah. Aggressively approach a white man and have the white man fight back. That&rsquo;s the nightmare Deval. Governor of Massachusetts, Land of the pilgrm&rsquo;s pride. Right. Bet you hate those Pilgrims, Deval.</p>
<p>What a disgrace he is in the state that produced John Winthrop, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Conant, Henry Cabot Lodge, Henry Adams and even JFK. These people all had manners, Deval (and normal American Names).</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t these black people like Patrick and Obama know how to have a respectful but humorous discussion with a law enforcement officer? </p>
<p>Oh yes, Patrick IS the chief Law Enforcement Officer of Massachusetts. Great.</p>

		<p>The truth of the matter in this deal is that Gates was going to make himself a cause and it backfired. The MSM and TV news has decided to drop it when the cause wasnt there. You dont see it anywhere because Master Gates said it wasnt about him any longer. These farces are allowed to continue until they find there is nothing in it.  The MSM and TV crucified the Duke Soccer players like they did those in the Tawana Brawley deal. White folks probably need to sell everything they have and move to Africa because we have become slaves or is it we are cowards?</p>
