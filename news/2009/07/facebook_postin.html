<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} On Monday, a young aide to a New York City politician resigned after posting comments on her Facebook page about the controversy.</p>
<p>The aide, Lee Landor, who had been the deputy press secretary to the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, since May, posted comments on her Facebook page criticizing Mr. Gates and the president, whom she referred to at one point as &#8220;O-dumb-a.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Ms. Landor&rsquo;s comments were totally inappropriate and in direct contradiction to the views of the borough president and his office,&#8221; Dick Riley, Mr. Stringer&rsquo;s communications director, said in a statement on Monday evening. {snip}</p>

								<h2>The Facebook Comments That Got Lee Landors in Trouble</h2>

<p>&#8220;You know what, I am really getting SICK of hearing about how white people are evil racists. Black people, Hispanic people, Indian people, Asian people, whoever, are being over-the-top racists in recent weeks, as highlighted in the media since the Sotomayor-New Haven issue.</p>
<p>I get it  &mdash;  white men have dominated for hundreds of years and there&rsquo;s a lot of anger there. But HOW MUCH MORE can a white person do to correct the past injustices of their ancestors? Is affirmative action not enough? Is Equal Opportunity Employment meaningless? At least they&rsquo;re attempting to make the effort to right wrongs; give them a friggin&rsquo; break!&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and what would happen if the arresting officer was black? Or, what if the Harvard professor was a working class black man? Would Obama get involved then?</p>
<p>If Mr. Big Shot Harvard would have kept his mouth shut, shown ID and not started yelling at a police officer, he never would have been arrested. So please, it&rsquo;s time to get over this &#8216;it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m black&rsquo; bull  &mdash;  O-dumb-a, the situation got &#8220;out of hand&#8221; because Gates is a racist, not because the officer was DOING HIS JOB!</p>
<p>Is it any less stupid to start yelling at a police officer for asking you to step outside your home because he received a call that someone was potentially breaking into a house? Is it any less stupid to call that officer racist? What if someone broke in? I&rsquo;m sure this asshole Gates would have wanted the &#8220;racist&#8221; cop to arrest the perp.</p>
<p>And racial profiling does exist, but for good reasons. Take a look at this country&rsquo;s jails; who makes up a majority of the inmates? Exactly?<br>

		<p>Racial profiling is completely logical.  Every single crime category in America is lead by blacks, hispanics come in second, whites third and Asians last.  Since the so-called Civil Rights movement began more whites have been killed in America by blacks than there were soldiers killed in the Vietnam War.  Does anyone know of a black leader or national Politician that cares!<br>
After 60 years of fighting for &#8220;civil rights&#8221; blacks are the most<br>
&#8220;uncivil&#8221; of all the races in America.  One of the reasons for this is that black leaders are apologists and &#8220;victims&#8221;, like Gates.  Instead of demanding responsibility and &#8220;civilness&#8221; for their black &#8220;brehtren&#8221; they provide a &#8220;smokescreen&#8221;, it&rsquo;s called Racial Profiling!</p>

		<p> Kudos, Ms. Landor, for not being afraid to tell the truth! Of course, when it comes to matters of race, &#8220;the truth&#8221; is the last thing bleeding-heart liberals want to hear. It&rsquo;s too painful   &mdash;   because it IS the truth.</p>
<p> They&rsquo;re the kind of people who say, &#8220;We need a real dialogue on race in this country.&#8221; OK, folks, let&rsquo;s have a dialogue. Ms. Landor gave her opinion; obviously you&rsquo;ve got a right to give yours, too. What you should NOT have, in a free society, is the right to shout her down, or SHUT her down, or force her to lose her job, just because you don&rsquo;t like what she says. I think the name she chose for our fearless leader   &mdash;   &#8220;O-dumb-a&#8221; fits perfectly.</p>

		<p>Seems like the worm is turning, ever so slowly right now, but you never know about how things can all of a sudden escalate and you lose control. If a young woman like this can post something like that, I think our adversaries better start to watch out. Maybe they jumped the gun a bit with this obama fella after all.</p>
<p>Sorry the yung woman lost her job, but I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s better off now.</p>

		<p>Totally agree with this lady!  WE know why this is happening to us and it is time we took a stand or else our freedom of speech or any truths will be outlawed if it concerns the &#8220;protected&#8221; classes in this country! WE (Whites) are not one of those protected classes. WE are the new oppressed and dispossed in our own nation! How many times have we heard nonwhites say and do terrible things to Whites with nary a protest? That alone should tell us what is going on here.</p>

		<p>I just wonder how many white people feel the same way as this woman does.  For a long while I feared that only a small percentage of us had awakened to the war that has been raging against white middle class people.  I now believe that many normal &#8220;non racist&#8221; whites are completely fed up with the endless accusations of white racism and prejudice that white liberals and non-white activist groups bloviate about on a daily basis.  People are awakening to the absolute hypocrisy of the anti-white left in this country.  </p>

		<p>The real story here is the power of Facebook and other social networking sites.  I recently got a job at an institution where I will be a more public figure, and I am already cleaning up my Facebook.  Of course, I would NEVER say anything about race on my Facebook page.  Although I read all kinds of liberal in-your-face garbage on my friends&rsquo; Facebook accounts, I know that if I ever posted anything to challenge their views it could have consequences for my professional life as well.</p>
<p>The rule for Facebook and other social networking sites is simple: don&rsquo;t say anything that will offend a liberal if you are in any way a public figure. </p>

<p>That is absolutely correct. I&rsquo;m sure there are many Public Servants posting anti-white, ultra left wing tripe with nothing to fear. Where I work a crazy white boy ultra left wing loon spends his day-at work on the public dime, typing away at left wing websites. But that&rsquo;s OK has he&rsquo;s on the right side.</p>
<p>This story overall may be positive in that she came across these views, which are to me mostly correct. I wonder how many other white folks, especially in Liberal New York feel this way and how many people read the newspaper today and said &#8220;You Know What She&rsquo;s 100% correct&#8221;. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s an odd world we live in when a very large segment of the U.S. population (even many non-whites) would totally agree with what Miss. Landor (allegedly) wrote.  And yet it is still not permissible to say, or write, such things publicly in public sectors.  Reminds me of Stalinist Russia - where just about everybody knew the truth but nobody could speak it.</p>

Has anyone heard about the murder of young Lilly Burk in LA? Fox News reported it this afternoon but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything about it on any network.  The only story I found was in the online edition or the LA Times. It&rsquo;s amazing how stories like Lilly&rsquo;s get no coverage but a rope in a tree from which no one was hanged is world news for months.</p>

<p>Eric Holder happens to believe we are nation of cowards. And he said the following: &#8220;Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot in things racial, we have always been, and we, I believe, continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards,&#8221; Holder said at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. &#8220;Though race-related issues continue to occupy a significant portion of our political discussion, and though there remain many unresolved racial issues in this nation, we, average Americans, simply do not talk enough with each other about things racial. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I just wonder how many white people feel the same way as this woman does.&#8221;</p>
<p>MOST white people want to live in an all white country (as we have done for over 10,000 years).<br>
I can prove it unequivocally, without even asking any of them their opinions, by using scientific facts, otherwise known as &#8216;Revealed Preference&rsquo;.<br>
In the 1950s, when the first black families came over here (the U.K.) to live, they moved into certain areas. Those areas rapidly became &#8216;ghettos&rsquo; and experienced an increase in non-whites, and a decrease in whites. <br>
As soon as a house went up for sale in one of those areas, in the 1960s and 1970s, there would have been at least twenty times as many potential WHITE buyers as non-white. Yet somehow, those areas became more and more non-white. The ONLY scientific explanation for this is if the vast majority of potential white buyers did not want to live around non-whites. This is a hypothesis which is proved correct by the actions of literally MILLIONS of white house buyers, over the past fifty years. It cannot be refuted, or argued against. It is the ONLY explanation.<br>
So the next time a leftie tries to tell you that &#8216;most&rsquo; white people just love &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo;, ask them about house buying choices&hellip;</p>

		<p>The only mistake in her post was implying she, and the rest of us (Whites) were responsible IN ANY WAY for the suffering of the past.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I can not explain why, but since I was a child, I have never fallen for this.  Perhaps in my personal case I had more reason to feel the way I did, ie; that is was easier for me to justify and validate my view on the matter, than it would have been for a middle or upper middle class White.  <br>
Either way, I have never felt any guilt.<br>
The reason?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not guilty. None of us are. </p>
<p>But I love how they say only Whites can be racist.  Non-Whites can&rsquo;t because Racism = Power and non-Whites don&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>But this argument is ALWAYS made by Whites who have Power and the accusation is very often, in fact usually, levelled at poor Whites who don&rsquo;t have any Power and so, by their own definition, can not be &#8220;racists&#8221;!!!!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to have a firm grasp of this obvious fact and feel guilty at the same time.</p>

		<p>According to the NYC employee web page Ms. Landor did her keyboarding on Facebook while on the job. (as opposed to on her own time) Of course there are probably hundreds of other NYC employees that blog on Huffington Post and look at on line porn while on the NYC taxpayer dime</p>

		<p>To Terrified @ #13.  There are many constructive things you can say about race that should not get you in trouble.  Just make sure you use the vocabulary of the leftists.  Use words like &#8220;tolerance&#8221;, &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221;, &#8220;ant-hate&#8221;, &#8220;bigotry&#8221; and &#8220;self esteem&#8221;.  Direct positive, supportive comments toward groups that implicitly include whites.  You can write things like &#8220;I support inclusiveness for ALL of our public servants and they all deserve our support, when trying to do their jobs, regardless of their skin color.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can write many good things in ways that nobody can attack you for.</p>

		<p>My guess is that she got fired because the politician she worked for was afraid there would be a controversy that would affect him.  </p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d like to see are leftists being relentlessly ostracized for THEIR views on things.  I always say:  USE THE FAR LEFT&rsquo;S TACTICS AGAINST THEM!  Be confrontational, call them racists and homophobes, let them know that THEY are different, THEY are the fringe element, THEY are non-mainstream.  Treat them like they are mentally disturbed (I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that they truly are).  </p>
<p>Most European Americans, even self-described liberals, are indeed aware.  I try to call the truth as I see it, without using slurs or nastiness.  If more of us do it, the domino effect will ensue and the tide will turn.</p>

		<p>This is a little more than worrying. It is downright frightening.<br>
When the state starts censoring personal opinions and deems them<br>
&#8220;inappropriate and in direct contradiction to the views of the borough president&#8221; it is time to clean your weapons and head for the hills.</p>

		<p>not too bright. you get a cushy job for a democrat liberal (who does nothing-these &#8220;borough&#8221; jobs sound important but they are just symbols that a faction is part of the Mayor&rsquo;s Mafia) and then you trash their ideology. On Facebook. Do these kids understand the internet goes to the whole world. If you want say somethinig to your wife, lover, boss or best friend on a personal level, don&rsquo;t put it on Facebook.  She didn&rsquo;t think liberal problack sissies are TOLERANT, did she? Oh, she did. Too bad.</p>

		<p>When I first heard of the Gates thing one of my first reactions was, </p>
<p>Well, now we know who the Hate Crime Law is for.</p>
<p>If the roles were reversed Professor Crowley would have been arretsed for</p>
<p>Breaking and Entering<br>
Disturbing the Peace<br>
and<br>
A Hate Crime (for his Hate Speech).</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious.</p>
<p>So, we have Hate Crime Laws, Vampire-like Taxation (to cover for Banksters who are stealing our money and handing it over to people in any and every organization designed specificially to eliminate us), Mass Immigration, Affirmative Action, and now the Health Care Bill (or, as I like to call it, the Health Careless Bill: as in, &#8220;We could care less about you.  Just sign it.&#8221;  Pretty much what they did with the tax increase and everything else they are doing).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that they are pulling all the stops.</p>
<p>Balls in our court.  And don&rsquo;t think for a second there is nothing we can do.  </p>

		<p>Since whites are not protected by the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; statutes, we are no longer bound by the restrictions that these &#8220;laws&#8221; impose on us.<br>
eric holder and barack hussein obama have both declared that &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws apply ONLY to minorities  &mdash;  not to whites.<br>
Sell your house only to white people.  Gated communities and homeowner associations are a result of the &#8220;fair housing&#8221; laws.<br>
Hire who you want.  Names like lakeesha and laquanda are a dead giveaway on who NOT to hire.<br>
In business, freedom of association can be achieved with some difficulty.  Establish a trusted white clientele.  Discreetly explain why you do not do business with certain minorities.  You will find that your business will grow despite the lack of a black &#8220;clientele&#8221;.<br>
Real estate &#8220;diversity&#8221; testers are one area that is easy for white people to tell if a &#8220;tester&#8221; is white or black.  Black inflections in speech are easy to spot and cannot be disguised or masked easily.<br>
The ingratitude that is shown by blacks towards those whites that made &#8220;civil rights&#8221; possible will be the undoing of blacks IF white people &#8220;wake up&#8221;.<br>
The racial divide in this country is being reinforced by the actions of our black racist &#8220;leaders&#8221; starting with obama on down.<br>
All one has to look at the condition of Detroit (under black &#8220;rule&#8221; for the last 40 years) to see where the black &#8220;messiah&#8221; obama (and his minions) are taking the country.<br>
Friends, it is time to take back our country.</p>

		<p>Facebook is fun and useful, and when it isn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t use it.  It&rsquo;s that simple.  There are all kinds of fun and silly things you can do with it, as well as things more constructive and interesting, from contacting old friends or them contacting you, to sharing information and networking for that purpose.</p>
<p>But heads up gang.  There are moles and plants there, of course.</p>
<p>For example. A friend of mine yesterday told me that he accepted an invitation from someone, a pretty young lady in fact, and when he accepted her her wall page was loaded with corny Nazi stuff.  He bounced her immediately of course.</p>
<p>He also said that she had lots of friends and when he looked many of them, but obviously not all, were pretty girls too.  Just like her.<br>
My gut feeling is that its all baloney. Loads of hot Nazi girls.<br>
Yeah, the world is full of them.  My gosh, how transparent.<br>
The Left is notorious for sneaky tactics like that.  So, buyer beware, so to speak!</p>

<p>You have to wonder if this sort of &#8220;fishing expedition&#8221; nonsense on Facebook &amp; My Space is the work of SPLC (Southern Poverty Law Center) crew. </p>

		<p>Dedalus,<br>
I&rsquo;ve stated this before vis a vis Blacks&rsquo; &#8220;lack of power&#8221;. They are largely responsible for making vast areas of this country unlivable for the any civilized person be they White, Black or Asian.<br>
The streets of many of our major cities are unsafe day or night. They have destroyed our public schools and forced a growing number of families to spend more money in home schooling while at the same time paying their taxes; the same for parents who send their children to private or parochial schools. <br>
Our justice system has been hamstrung by the burden of repeat offenders and violent outbursts in courtroom as the &#8220;families&#8221; and &#8220;peeps&#8221; of the perpetrators assault witnesses and lawyers. The penal system is so overcrowded that they are letting many of these ferals out early to commit future atrocities against the innocent. <br>
They degrade every area where the move in because they are incapable of understanding what it means to treat other civilly.<br>
I live on a barrier island where due to the economy there has been a downturn in summer rentals.  The landlords of many of the rental apts. and houses have turned to Section 8 or other government subsidy programs and therefore we have a sizeable influx of Blacks. LAst evening my neighbor across the street was walking his dog when a young Black thug type was heading his way. As he got closer to my neighbor he shouted &#8220;Y&rsquo;all betta hold dat dog Muthah F  &mdash;  -ah&#8221;.<br>
My neighbor held his tongue because he was only feet away from his home and of course we have no idea where the &#8220;youf&#8221; lived but he knew where my neighbor lived. It&rsquo;s a no win situation.</p>
<p>THis my friend IS POWER!!!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got an idea. If Ms. Landor thinks her career in public office is over, she might want to think again. She should look into the career of Frank Borzelleri, who was an elected official on a school board in her very own city. He was able to say a lot of very honest things and get away with it because so many of the &#8220;silent majority&#8221; secretly agreed with him! It sounds like a definite career option for Ms. Landor, whose career in public service is definitely NOT all washed up!</p>
