<p>About the Campaign</p>
<p>A Richer Life is a public awareness campaign developed by the National Fair Housing Alliance, dedicated to the creation and sustenance of diverse communities throughout the nation.</p>
<p>Living in integrated communities means having neighbors from all walks of life, from different ethnic backgrounds and of various beliefs, providing the opportunity for deeper and more varied experiences that will prepare us and our children for the mix of people that makes up this great country and for the interactions of the global economy. We believe it is the right of us all to live in healthy, diverse communities and that we all deserve to benefit from the richer life they bring.</p>
<p>State Farm is the major underwriter of the A Richer Life campaign and activities commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act.

<p>Having lived in a vibrant, diverse community in a large city while in our 20&rsquo;s, my husband and I were thrilled to move to the boring white suburbs, where we are raising our kids and have no intention of moving. </p>
<p>I read somewhere that typical neighborhoods in this country are only 4% more integrated than they were in 1950.  Sounds about right.</p>
<p>BTW, cancel your State Farm if you haven&rsquo;t already done so and tell them why.  AAA and Farmer&rsquo;s Insurance are both excellent.</p>

		<p> &#8220;A Richer Life is &hellip; dedicated to the creation and sustenance of diverse communities throughout the nation.<br>
Living in integrated communities means having neighbors from all walks of life, from different ethnic backgrounds and of various beliefs, providing the opportunity for deeper and more varied experiences that will prepare us and our children for the mix of people that makes up this great country and for the interactions of the global economy.&#8221;</p>
<p><b><i>Comment: </i></b>That is fine-sounding preaching, coming almost certainly  from those who do not themselves live in such  delightful, enriching communities.  </p>
<p>Myself, I  don&rsquo;t need their preaching.  I learned  about diversity first hand.  I lived for 16 years in a heavily integrated community, and working in a similar environment. Both were chaos. I ended up being practically the only one who was keeping it integrated (and my contribution to this end was plainly not appreciated). In other words, I was one of the last whites out.</p>
<p>It was sheer hell watching the neighborhood crumble and deteriorate around me with all that rich &#8220;diversity&#8221;, but quite an educational experience which I&rsquo;ll never forget, and  after countless bad experiences I&rsquo;m truly lucky to be still alive.  That wised me up.  I started as a naive and trusting young liberal, with good will to all, but ended as something else. I became a hardened, cynical right-winger who had been through mill. Liberal propaganda no longer worked on me.  Like everyone else who can, I got out as soon as I could afford it, in the nick of time, and that probably saved my life.  Being so much the wiser now, I would NEVER go back there again.  I wouldn&rsquo;t even ride through the neighborhood where I once lived.  (And I am not exaggerating!)</p>
<p><br>
 &#8220;We believe it is the right of us all to live in healthy, diverse communities and that we all deserve to benefit from the richer life they bring.&#8221;</p>
<p><b><i>Question:</i></b> Sounds great! I&rsquo;m all for rights.  Speaking of rights,  is it also my right to live next to someone who doesn&rsquo;t want to be anywhere near me?   If so, then  I wonder if we also have a silmilar &#8220;right&#8221; to live among ouselves   &mdash;   if that is what we would prefer?   Or is living among our own not a right?  Maybe it only works the other way. I&rsquo;m unsure about this.</p>
<p>In other words, do I have a right to live among people who are not like me and don&rsquo;t want me around; but I do not have a right to live among others like myself?   And do others have a right to live next to me, but I do NOT have a right NOT to live next to them?</p>
<p>Please clarify.  All this diversity stuff is VERY confusing! </p>

When is somebody going to debunk this nonsense that Diversity brings  &#8220;a richer life&#8221;?</p>
<p>In fact, it already has been done.  There was, for example, a Harvard study done not long ago (featured here on Amren) establishing the fact that Diversity decreases mutual trust and interaction and causes people to withdraw into themselves.</p>
<p>Still, we get this endless propaganda for Diversity, despite all of the facts to the contrary.</p>

		<p>I have an idea, why don&rsquo;t we &#8220;integrate&#8221; liberal whites into the ghettos? They will be richer for the experience, of course. </p>
<p>&#8220;We believe it is the right of us all to live in healthy, diverse communities&#8221;</p>
<p>I should also have the right to live amongst my own kind. Somehow, though, that doesn&rsquo;t appear in State Farm&rsquo;s Insurance policy.</p>
<p>A better article would be, &#8220;Live Around That Can Actually Afford To Live In The Houses They Have&#8221;. I get along just fine with my Chinese, Japanese, Hindu and Jewish neighbors. </p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s something just not quite right about the blacks that sit home all day or work low-end factory jobs while living in $500K homes.</p>

		<p>When I lived in an all-white neighborhood I was all for diversity. Then I joined the military and experienced black culture up close and personal. That experience led me to run from diversity as quick as I could (at least when blacks are concerned).</p>
<p>But, to their credit, blacks never hector and badger each other to be more &#8220;tolerant,&#8221; &#8220;multicultural&#8221; or to &#8220;respect diversity.&#8221;<br>
Black race leaders don&rsquo;t have to encourage blacks to be black first, last and always. And they fight when their neighborhoods become &#8220;diverse.&#8221; They certainly don&rsquo;t send out the welcome wagon when whitey (or non-blacks) move into the &#8216;hood.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Yes indeed! You too can experience all the benefits of diversity by sponsoring a 3rd world family as your neighbor &hellip; today! Enjoy the ecstasy of hearing mariachi music from the house across the way as you entertain your in-laws and old uncle Ted. Marvel at the landscape as 8-10 junk cars line the street in front of your new neighbor&rsquo;s house&hellip; hopefully impeding entry/exit to your house. But hey, you&rsquo;re tolerant, enlightened&hellip; What&rsquo;s a little inconvenience in the name of diversity? Besides, your new neighbors are so thankful to be here and can&rsquo;t wait to adapt the ways of their new land. That&rsquo;s not 15 people living in a single family home, they&rsquo;re just having a sleep-over! And yes, that&rsquo;s right, they can afford a $25,000 car AND qualify for Food Stamps. American tolerance is such a wonderful thing! Don&rsquo;t mind the maggots&hellip;</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ve got to wonder if any of the people who spout this nonsense have actually ever lived in a &#8220;diverse community&#8221;.<br>
I have; those are the experiences by which I found myself here at Amren. I and my family NEVER gave races too much thought, especially regarding blacks, because we never had much exposure to them. We certainly got and education moving from white bread Orange Co., CA to NE San Antonio TX - it&rsquo;s DIVERSE, let me tell you, and when diverse gets worse, it&rsquo;s intolerable!<br>
I now live happily on the extreme NW side, where people have similar essential character traits, and, coincidentally, are mainly white like me.;)<br>
I suspect these promoters of &#8220;a Richer Life&#8221; live in places like I now live in, and have never indulged themselves in such &#8220;wonders of diversity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve lived in our house for 42 years and watched our neighborhood go from all white to 50% white. Our community is now a colder more alienated place. We no longer know who is living on our street. We used to socialize with our adjacent neighbors but now we socialize only with the white ones along the street. For houses further away I only exchange pleasantries and hellos with whites. There is more crime in our district. Bus drivers are behind protective shields. There is a policeman posted in the high school. There are more security guards at the mall. You don&rsquo;t see women going for a walk in the dusk hours. There is no sense of community around here.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Encourage and accept diversity in your neighborhood and community. It will promote a greater sense of engagement, better prepare your children for the global community they will inhabit &hellip; give us all a richer life.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have greater engagement all right with diversity in our neighborhoods.  It&rsquo;s called civil conflict, and it&rsquo;s coming soon to a neighborhood near you.  But I doubt we will have a &#8220;richer&#8221; life.  It will be more like a life fighting for survival.  I don&rsquo;t keep saying that, because I desire it, but because the facts are staring me right in the face.</p>
<p>I just spent an hour getting current on the latest economic news, and I can&rsquo;t help but wonder how anybody can still devote time to social engineering and promoting their scatter-brained dreams of a rainbow utopia when even Bill O&rsquo;Reilly is saying we&rsquo;re headed for an earth shattering crash.

		<p>No doubt all those people banging their gums are pushing for diversity in other people&rsquo;s neighborhoods and handpicking a couple of tokens for their own. If they are so all fired up about diversity then why don&rsquo;t they just move to a &#8220;diverse&#8221; neighborhood and leave the rest of us alone?</p>

		<p>What a load of smelly bull these executives at these mainly white owned &amp; operated corporations feel pressured (you know it!) into pretending agreement to. First of all, by &#8220;diversity&#8221; they mean, of course, pigmentation diversity - the only kind that seems to count. It&rsquo;s not enough that white people are a very diverse lot in themselves intellectually, culturally, etc.</p>
<p>How many of these high up executives in these sponsoring corporations live in very &#8220;diverse&#8221; neighborhoods? I bet they like their safe, gated, non-diverse communities for their families just fine. And gee, how come so many of them don&rsquo;t send their kids to public schools that just reeks of &#8220;diversity&#8221;? This organization should talk to President Obama to inform him of the wonders of diversity that their kids are missing out on.</p>

		<p>The Doublespeak in this article is incredible:</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe it is the right of us all to live in healthy, diverse communities and that we all deserve to benefit from the richer life they bring.&#8221; It&rsquo;s obvious that what they mean by this is it&rsquo;s the *duty* of us all to live in these kinds of &#8220;communities,&#8221; the &#8220;healthy, diverse&#8221; oxymoron notwithstanding. Naturally, there&rsquo;s no mention of the right of whites to live with our own kind.</p>
<p>What makes this whole article so laughable is that there are hundreds of &#8220;diverse&#8221; communities around right now, but they are communities in name only. A recent study concluded that people who live in &#8220;diverse communities&#8221; feel alienated, insecure, afraid and reluctant to associate with their neighbors. The whole &#8220;community&#8221; suffers as a result. Crime soars and the fabric of society disintegrates. By contrast, ethnically homogeneous communities exhibit stability, trust and a high degree of participation in society by the citizens.</p>
<p>Looking at the list of sponsors, I can&rsquo;t help but be impressed by the number of financial institutions that are behind this - all corporate whores par excellence, none of whom care the least about preserving the society that birthed them. Looks like a good list of firms to boycott.</p>

<p>I agree with you on that, but I think they will approach it more subtlely. They will seek to promote inter-racial marriages and neighborhoods though tax rebates, favored housing and education, promotions, and other such inducements.  And many whites will give in to the lure and bite the bait.  For obvious reasons, government always prefers using the carrot rather than the stick.  It&rsquo;s just easier that way. </p>

		<p>I clicked on the tab labeled &#8220;The Importance of Diversity&#8221; and I laughed so hard at what I saw that again I&rsquo;m wondering if this is really some parody by a fellow Amrenner.</p>
<p><i>Diversity stimulates local economic growth</i></p>
<p>Right.  That&rsquo;s why our most economically productive cities are Detroit, Newark, Memphis, and East St. Louis.  If increasing welfare payments in your neighborhood is your idea of economic growth, you&rsquo;ll love diversity.</p>
<p><br>
<i>Diversity produces culturally vibrant communities</i></p>
<p>I live in one of those communities.  Sometimes my windows vibrate from the Mestizos&rsquo; mariachi music.  Sometimes they vibrate from the blacks&rsquo; rap music.  Sometimes they just vibrate from some argument going on.  I&rsquo;d much rather have no vibrancy so I can listen to my classical music.  Then there&rsquo;s the apparently genetically fixed tendency of Mestizos to park their monster trucks on their lawns.  Or sometimes even on my lawn (on the grass strip between the sidewalk and the curb).  Another apparently fixed trait of the diversity is their tendency to never put trash in a trash can.  Why should they when the street and other people&rsquo;s yards are a much bigger target?  Why oh why don&rsquo;t rich liberal whites avail themselves of this diversity?  I&rsquo;d be happy to sell them my house.</p>
<p><br>
<i>Diverse schools enrich the lives of all students and prepare them to thrive in a multicultural world</i></p>
<p>Oh God this just too hilarious!  So why are our majority black and Hispanic schools nearly all academic basket cases?  The single life experience most likely to make someone a lifelong member of American Renaissance is attendence (or better yet, teaching) at a diverse school.</p>
<p><br>
<i>Diversity improves access to jobs.</i></p>
<p>Right.  Bringing in 20 million illegal aliens to bust unions and drive down wages did a great deal to help working class Americans get access to jobs.  And the H-1b and L-2 programs have displaced a great many middle class Americans from their jobs.  When I first started working in a technical field all but one of the technical people at the company I worked for were native born Americans.  At my current job I&rsquo;m one of only two native born Americans in the technical work.  We&rsquo;re outnumbered by both the Chinese and the Indians.  They are competent in their work, but there is no question that if they weren&rsquo;t here some white guys would have the jobs instead.  While Korean immigrants do create their own businesses they prefer to hire other Koreans.</p>
<p>Assuming that that web site is not a parody, I wonder   &mdash;   do the creators of that masterpiece really believe what they wrote, or do they really believe they can fool very many people?<br>

<p>Living in integrated communities means having neighbors from all walks of CRIME, from different ethnic backgrounds and of various beliefs, providing the opportunity for deeper and more VIOLENT experiences that will prepare us and our children for the mix of people that SLOWLY DESTROYS this great country AND IS JUDAEO-CHRISTIAN HERITAGE and for the SUBMISSION TO THE global economy.

We can buy oil from and sell grain to Arabs without having a single Arab living in America.  We could buy electronics from Korea and sell them military equipment without ever living next to a Korean.  It is stupid.  All we need to live in a global economy is to respect other nations cultures and laws, and speak their langauage (or they ours).

<p>&#8220;I want a richer life.</p>
<p>I want to live in a neighborhood that reflects the realities of our society as a whole – a society that is becoming far more varied and diverse. I want the benefits that living in integrated communities brings. I want neighbors from different ethnic backgrounds who can help me appreciate the beauty of diversity and better prepare my children for a future in which they will be part of a truly multicultural world.</p>
<p>I embrace the goal of this richer life for myself and my family and support the work of the National Fair Housing Alliance to promote neighborhood diversity in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, diversity is strength.  I think someone named Orwell had something to say about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll believe this when all of your corporate sponsor&rsquo;s CEOs, CFOs, board of directors, etc. move to the &#8216;hood.  I&rsquo;d like a list of said sponsor&rsquo;s head honchos race/ethnicity and their neighborhood&rsquo;s, just for comparison.  And how many of these send their kids to public schools, where they can revel in the joys of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; (violence, drugs, sex, etc.)?</p>
<p>Basically, you are asking me to accept MORE crime, MORE poverty, and more RACIAL/ETHNIC/RELIGIOUS TENSION where I live, in exchange for what?</p>
<p>Please, please tell me why is it that we must be taught and experience &#8220;multiculturalism (brainwashing)&#8221; constantly in a vain effort to &#8220;just get along&#8221;?  You know why?  Because I don&rsquo;t think there is a people on this earth that don&rsquo;t want to be WITH THEIR OWN KIND and/or JUST LEFT ALONE!  (OK, actually, when black persons/families get prosperous enough, a good percentage of them move to WHITE neighborhoods!  Does that tell you anything?  How about a black person&rsquo;s propensity to commit murder compared to a white person&rsquo;s?  Go to the FBI&rsquo;s website and look it up in their Uniform Crime Report.)</p>
<p>I shall keep your list of corporate sponsors in mind the next time I need their services (NOT).</p>

		<p> An interesting article on the real effects of diversity in a community. </p>
<p>Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam, author of Bowling Alone, is very nervous about releasing his new research, and understandably so. His five-year study shows that immigration and ethnic diversity have a devastating short- and medium-term influence on the social capital, fabric of associations, trust, and neighborliness that create and sustain communities. He fears that his work on the surprisingly negative effects of diversity will become part of the immigration debate, even though he finds that in the long run, people do forge new communities and new ties.</p>
<p>Putnam&rsquo;s study reveals that immigration and diversity not only reduce social capital between ethnic groups, but also within the groups themselves. Trust, even for members of one&rsquo;s own race, is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friendships fewer. The problem isn&rsquo;t ethnic conflict or troubled racial relations, but withdrawal and isolation. Putnam writes: &ldquo;In colloquial language, people living in ethnically diverse settings appear to &lsquo;hunker down&rsquo; &mdash; that is, to pull in like a turtle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the 41 sites Putnam studied in the U.S., he found that the more diverse the neighborhood, the less residents trust neighbors. This proved true in communities large and small, from big cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Boston to tiny Yakima, Washington, rural South Dakota, and the mountains of West Virginia. In diverse San Francisco and Los Angeles, about 30 percent of people say that they trust neighbors a lot. In ethnically homogeneous communities in the Dakotas, the figure is 70 percent to 80 percent.</p>

		<p>So basically what I get out of this quest for cultural richness is that Americans don&rsquo;t actually HAVE the right to live where they want. Rather, they are herded to diversify neighborhoods through any means available: guilt, finance, welfare programs (which benefit only the minorities), greedy landlords, etc. When the people who are able to relocate to a more homogeneous (safe, comfortable) location and racial one again becomes evident, they start the cycle all over. The law says all races are ALLOWED to lived among other races. It doesn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s required - although that is certainly only temporary, as it IS implied.<br>

		<p>If diversity were such a strength why is it that it&rsquo;s always the whites who leave and move away from it? If <br>
diversity were such a strength wouldn&rsquo;t it have benefited the whites as well as the African - Americans. If diversity were indeed such a strength there would be absolutely no need to advertise it, to legalize it, or to mandate it. The fact that all of the above is necessary to cram the concept of diversity down whitey&rsquo;s throat, is absolute, irrefutable proof, that diversity is a nothing more, nothing less, than what it has always been, and what is will always be, a damn lie! <br>

		<p>After 40 years of living in the hellhole known as Memphis TN, I Now live a richer life in the mountains of Virginia. Not much crime, 99.8% white and can sleep with the doors unlocked if I choose to. Memphis now is #2 in violent crime according to the FBI stats. Whoever thought up this program at STATE FARM has lost their friggen mind, and never lived in a diverse culture of mexicans and blacks. Thank God I&rsquo;m already living a RICHER LIFE, and State Farm just lost another homeowner&rsquo;s policy. </p>

		<p>&#8220;We believe it is the right of us all to live in healthy, diverse communities and that we all deserve to benefit from the richer life they bring.&#8221;</p>
<p>As long as this &#8220;right&#8221; does not get written into our constitution&hellip;</p>
<p>Do we also have the right to NOT live in a diverse community?  That is the real question at stake.</p>

		<p>I still do not understand what it is about diversity that so many people love. Based on my personal experience as a white kid growing up in the 21st century Bay Area, diversity more often than not fosters conflict. This is not to say that different groups cannot be around one another. I have had many non-white friends throughout the years. This is only to say that forced integration cannot work. The government and diversity organizations cannot force people to love on another.  Malcolm X once asserted that &#8220;you cannot legislate brotherhood.&#8221; Even though I have non-white and white friends, too much diversity makes me suspicious.</p>

		<p>post #52(anonymous) describes an interesting study by Robert Putnam of Harvard that will apparently show diversity in neighborhoods causes people to withdraw from one another. Immigrants factor into this destruction of communities. Who would have the guts to tell Congress this when it considers the amnesty legislation later this year or next?</p>

<p>I beg to differ. After reading sixty comments, I am rather surprised that no one has asked the simple and obvious question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Cui Bono?&#8221; Who benefits?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see. Judging from that list, the sponsors fall into two categories, roughly: insurance companies, and home finance companies. </p>
<p>The home finance companies want to get as many people into houses as possible, but the only trouble is, whites are already way oversaturated in houses. So, it&rsquo;s time to bring in the various hues of brown. </p>
<p>And the insurance companies sell to people worried about misfortune  &mdash;  car wrecks, vandalism, burglaries, and arson. All of these go up when swarthy elements move in, thus people purchase more insurance. I&rsquo;ve heard of McMansion developers building and selling low-end, low-profit apartments at cost, right next to older but still nice neighborhoods. It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one other thing at play here. Pre-emptive inoculation against justice department witch hunts. I&rsquo;ve noticed a lot of industries increasing the numbers of blacks in their commercials lately. This may merely be the equivalent of a shop owner paying money into a mafia protection racket. These companies may be protecting themselves from diversity lawsuits and accusations of preying on poor helpless minorities by grandstanding members of congress, who are looking to pin the blame for the housing bubble on anyone but themselves.</p>

<p>I think you hit the nail on the head.  The real reason our corporate masters promote affirmative action and diversity is because they want to avoid EEOC and &#8220;Fair Housing&#8221; lawsuits, and boycotts by Al Sharpton.  Basically the CEO, president, and corporate lawyers decided that the benefits of buying off the diversity mongers are high, and the downside costs are low.  When a dozen Amerenners cancel their insurance I&rsquo;m afraid that will never register with corporate headquarters as being due to their advocacy of diversity.</p>

Yes indeed    &mdash;   cui bono?  That&rsquo;s often the way to get to the bottom of it.</p>

		<p>Since when should the Government tell you who you have to sell your house to? Do they tell you who you have to sell your car, stereo, or guitar to? No. So why are they on White American Citizens, through HUD, to ensure we sell to Minorities? That&rsquo;s outrageous. </p>
<p>I have a solution to the MLS of your local Real Estate Broker, and how to get around selling to other than your own people, which would certainly destabilize a Community. </p>
<p>When you are in the Market to sell your home, don&rsquo;t list with a Real Estate Broker, but rather inform your Brother Lodge members at whatever Fraternal Organization that you belong to, that your house is for sale. Tell them, and only them, about it. That keeps the lid on the availability of the house for sale, to the right type of people. </p>
<p>You can repeat this at any Ethnic or Cultural Club, or Sewing Club, for that matter, but the results would be the same. </p>

<p>Yes, at least it would help. But you can&rsquo;t guarantee that everyone else in your neighborhood would do the same.  Somebody would sell.  So that&rsquo;s the leak in the dyke.  Eventually, the ocean will still get through. You&rsquo;re just delaying the flood. </p>
<p>And if Washington caught on to what you&rsquo;re doing, I suppose the neighborhood-busters would find some strategy to come in and build section 8 housing, or import a few thousand Sudanese refugees to &#8220;enrich&#8221; you with their diversity.  Somehow, they would find a way. They have all the power of government on their side.</p>
<p>Remember that those  now in power, like Obama and Holder (and so many others), are mulattoes.  They aren&rsquo;t looking to create purely &#8220;black&#8221; neighborhoods.  They&rsquo;re looking to create  <i>miscegenated  </i>neighborhoods   &mdash;    places that they would feel comfortable in   &mdash;   because that&rsquo;s what they are.  They want your neighborhood to look like THEM, not you.   But they don&rsquo;t want them to look too black either.</p>
