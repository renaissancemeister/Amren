			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Tancredo, Townhall.com, July 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last week, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Patrick Leahy spoke out against critics of Sonia Sotomayor as playing &#8220;racial politics.&#8221; According to Leahy, &#8220;You have one leader of the Republican party call her the equivalent of the head of the Ku Klux Klan.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That&rsquo;s what comes across. It comes across that if you belong to a group that tries to help Hispanics .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. somehow you&rsquo;re suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The last thing the Democrats want is for the American people to know about the National Council of La Raza, their radical agenda and Sotomayor&rsquo;s association with the group.</p>
<p>Sotomayor was a member of La Raza and her comments about &#8220;Wise Latinas&#8221; being superior to white men appeared in the La Raza Law Journal. The National Council of La Raza bills itself as &#8220;the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States&#8221; who works through &#8220;its network of nearly 300 affiliated community-based organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among these affiliates are several chapters of the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán (Chicano Student Movement of Aztlán) who La Raza helps fund. Aztlán is what radical &#8220;Mechistas&#8221;  &mdash;  as they refer to themselves on La Raza&rsquo;s website  &mdash;  call the American Southwest, which they claim still belongs to Mexico. Their slogan is &#8220;Por La Raza todo, Fuera de La Raza nada&#8221; meaning &#8220;For the Race everything, outside the Race nothing.&#8221; One chapter says on La Raza&rsquo;s site that their mission is &#8220;empowerment of our gente and the liberation of Aztlán.&#8221;</p>
<p>La Raza receives tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to set up charter schools like the Aztlán Academy of Tucson where they fly the Mexican Flag, but not the American Flag and teach students &#8220;Aztec Math.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1994, La Raza gave their &#8220;Chicano of the Year&#8221; Award to Jose Angel Guitierrez who once said, &#8220;We have got to eliminate the Gringo, and what I mean by that is that if the worse comes to the worst, we have got to kill him&#8221; and that &#8220;our devil has pale skin and blue eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While questioning her connections to radical left wing groups is off limits, attacking conservatives for belonging to mainstream organizations like the Federalist Society is fair game for the Democrats.</p>
<p>When Larry Thompson was up for Deputy Attorney General in 2001, Leahy questioned his role with the organization. Sen. Richard Durbin denounced the group as a &#8220;far right&#8221; group who he implied might want to bring back the Dred Scott decision upholding slavery.</p>
<p>The Federalist Society is nothing but a debating and social organization for conservative and libertarian law students and attorneys. In contrast to La Raza, it takes no position on legal cases or policy.</p>
<p>If membership in the Federalist Society is a problem for the Democrats, imagine how they would react if Samuel Alito or John Roberts belonged to a group called &#8220;The National Council of the White Race&#8221; who honored a man who once said &#8220;We have got to eliminate Latinos, and what I mean by that is that if the worse comes to the worst, we have got to kill him,&#8221; as &#8220;white man of the year.&#8221; They wouldn&rsquo;t pass the bar, much less become Supreme Court justices. But when a Hispanic or Black holds these views, we need to celebrate him for his diversity.</p>
<p>The Democrats support of Sotomayor and La Raza shows us what Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;post racial&#8221; America really looks like. Designated minority victim groups are free to promote their anti-white racist agenda, while any whites who fight back are playing &#8220;racial politics.&#8221;<br>

<p>&#8220;For the Race - Everything.  For those outside of the Race - nothing.&#8221;  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just a small group now relatively speaking, but large enough for all of 2008&rsquo;s Presidential candidates to have actually spoken before the &#8220;National Council of La Raza&#8221;.  They want to annex the Southwestern part of the United States for the new Hispanic country of Atzlan.  It&rsquo;s just unbelievable that a group with an agenda like this could actually attract Presidential Candidates for speeches, AND be accepted by the media. I guess that tells us what the agenda of the media is.  If this doesn&rsquo;t indicate where we are headed, then I&rsquo;m not sure what does.  </p>

		<p>Tancredo is right on.  At least there is one anti-illegal voice sounding off in mainstream politics.</p>
<p>This Sotomayor is a radical Mexican activist who dislikes whites and whose one main goal is to emplower mestizos.  She not only cares nothing for this country, unless it is mestizo dominated, she regards the constitution as just another piece of Gringo paper to have to get around to right the &#8220;oppression and injustices,&#8221; she delusionally perceives her people receive at the hands of whites.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just one more example of Obama&rsquo;s hatred for whites and the white power structure in this country.  His selection of a rabid hispanic activist who has no intention other than to manipulate the law as a tool to gain control for her tribal kin.</p>
<p>His support of the radical anti-white racist Henry Gates, and his appointments of black militants and white Marxists,  is further evidence of his desire to push out white Americans from all the positions of power he can do by deceit, manipulation, or lies.</p>
<p>The best thing that could happen to aware whites is for this administration to suffer one catastrophe after another to keep them busy enough that they can&rsquo;t work their plans against us.</p>
<p>And to those simple-minded duped whites who are helping to promote the messiah&rsquo;s agenda I would advise that they read a bit about history to remind themselves about what happens to those who align with people trying to destroy a country&rsquo;s way of life and traditions.  It&rsquo;s never pleasant.</p>

		<p> The older I get; the more baffled I become by the white race. Especially the so called &#8220;elites&#8221;. It seems we are undergoing some type of death wish. We praise the people that state openly of their desire to eliminate us from the face of the planet and condemn any white that takes an opposing viewpoint.<br>
 The Russians population has been dwindling too,unlike us they are attempting to reverse this situation.</p>

<p>Notice how you never see or hear this shocking remark mentioned by the MSM? If they played this up like they play up any white wrongdoing or misstatement, every American with a TV set would know of La Raza as a racist organization and as a &#8220;hate&#8221; group and Sotomayor would have no more chance of getting nominated to the Supreme Court than David Duke.  Proof positive that we live under a controlled media.</p>

<p>This is the last thing that Democrats may want, but it is also the worst thing that Republicans would ever want for Americans to become aware of. The two sides of the same coin that purchases nothing but treason, are most stealthy when that treason is not based on an acknowledged hatred of, but instead a sanctimoniously smirking mockery of, the primary (and also involuntary) supporters of that coin&rsquo;s value. </p>
<p>Who does that, the Republicans or the Democrats?</p>
<p>The Democrats are Reds, but at least they wantonly wallow in their witless wretchedness for all to see; the Republicans &ldquo;reject&rdquo; the same superficially in election cycles, only to pathetically practice the equivalent once in power. Or put another way; how else did the country fall from 85% white in 1980 to 65% white by 2007, after three Republican presidents were in office and only one Democrat had the same job for that time period?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>This is an excellent column which focuses on the real racism in Obama&rsquo;s Amerika. I didn&rsquo;t know La Raza gave their &ldquo;Chicano of the Year&rdquo; Award to Jose Angel Gutierrez for advocating the murder of whites. This certainly qualifies him for a position in the SPLC or the Dept. of Justice.</p>

<p>Just so we AM-Reners keep our facts straight here - Sotomayor is not a Mexican and has no history of agitating specifically for Mestizos, but a much broader spectrum of &#8220;Hispanics.&#8221; She herself is reportedly Puerto Rican, though ethnically she seems a bit of a mystery to me as she looks for all the world identical to my Jewish/European neighbor, and like few Puerto Ricans I have ever known here in NY&hellip;go figure!  </p>

		<p>Last night as I stood in line with my grandsons at MacDonalds, a very large, bald-headed Mexican in gang clothing stood nearby. on the back side of his HEAD was a prominent tatoo of &#8220;La Raza&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course he had several other tats, like the tear drops on his left eye, and other symbols of his gang&rsquo;s violence. He saw me reviewing his tats and gave me a scowling FU look.</p>
<p>La Raza is a sworn enemy of the United States, so why do they receive millions of tax dollars extorted by the IRS from white anglo-saxon natives? Simple answer, the Republicrat traitors want their cheap labor and easily manipulated votes.</p>
<p>Our traitorous judicial, executive and legislative branches have gone against their oaths to provide for the common defense and defend American CITIZENS against this Mexican invasion!</p>

<p>It is very simple.</p>
<p>An anti White, tax exempt organization called &#8220;THE RACE&#8221; slanders regular Whites, America calling us &#8220;Racist&#8221; - most fair people don&rsquo;t feel it is very fair to allow and openly racist organization called &#8220;THE RACE&#8221; to slander Whites with the charge &#8220;you&rsquo;re racist&#8221;.</p>

<p>Going by looks is really untenable in many cases, especially when it comes to Jews.  Does your neighbor look like Elizabeth Taylor, or Kirk Douglas or Paul Newman? or any number of beautiful White women who happen to come from families that have practiced Judaism?  I have known a few Christians who are not White and I bet you have too.  Every met a Black Jew?, there are many of those in the world as well as Arabic Christians.  The point is that it is a bad habit to generalize as broadly as you are doing - at least if you are trying to get &#8220;facts straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, in this case, you are almost accidently correct.  Sotomoyor is a Ladino extract.  Ladino was the Spainish/Hebrew language (now extinct) that developed in early Spain during Roman times when Latin was spoken by the Roman citizen settlers who mixed with the Jews who had long had communities there alongside Germanic Vandal tribes and many settlers from Carthage as well.  Barcelona was a major international trading port in those days.  Much later, after the &#8220;Christian Reconquesta&#8221; Jews were forced either to convert or leave Spain.  Many left, but many more remained and became Crypto Jews: Jews who practiced Catholicism but also retained some Jewish tradtions at home. Many eventually forgot they were Jewish and intermarried with others.  In fact, one expert lecturer I once heard on this subject said &#8220;In Spain, many say that if you are Spanish you are 1/3 Christian, 1/3 Muslim and 1/3 Jewish.&#8221;  Of course, this is a misappropriation of language to the objective investigator because on cannot actually be genetically a mix of three religions. Such ideas are based on locally developed and general assumptions that are erroneous - if you are interested in facts.</p>
<p>When Columbus made his journey to the New World, there were a number of known Jews on the voyage.  There is some valid evidences that Columbus himself was at least a secular Jew who feigned Catholicism for obvious reasons.  The Spainish crown was not against doing business with Jews and a Jew was in fact the royal banker.  He provided the credit to Ferdinand and Isabella for Columbus&rsquo; journey.  One of the first settlements in the New World was a majority Jewish region (must consult my history book for name and it is packed away at the moment).  It also turns out that many settlers of the Mexican Carribean and the region that became Texas were in fact Ladinos or Sepharic &#8220;Crypto&#8221; Jews.  DNA studies have confirmed this.  The name Sotomayor appears to me to be a Ladino version of the Yiddish (German, Slavic, Hebrew language of Ashkenazi Jews) Sotomayer - at least the suffix - the prefix might be the Spanish &#8220;Soto&#8221; with a distant Askenazi derived suffix.</p>
<p>I think that Sotomayor herself may not realize her own roots as this is a rather new genetic and genealogical discovery.  If she does, she probably wouldn&rsquo;t really want to be known for it because the &#8220;wise Latina&#8221; suddenly becomes the familiar (even for anti-semites) &#8220;wise Jewish mamma&#8221; and politically damaged.</p>

<p>Mexican? Puerto Rican?  Mestizo?  What makes the difference?  The term is correct as it is applied.</p>
<p>Mestizo:  &#8220;a person of racially mixed ancestry, esp., in Latin America, of mixed American Indian and European, usually Spanish or Portuguese, ancestry, or, in the Philippines, of mixed native and foreign ancestry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, old guy, but Mestizo seems to be correct.</p>
<p>Going off on matters of unimportant corrections only diverts our attention from more important matters. </p>
<p>&#8220;She herself is reportedly Puerto Rican&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but she considers herself a &#8220;latina,&#8221; which takes into account anyone from South America, Central America, Mexico and Puerto Rico, as the term is commonly used by all of them.</p>
<p>Can we stick to more important matters?   Or how about critiquing her policies?</p>

		<p>La Raza, Mexican Terrorist Organization</p>
<p>August 1, 2009</p>
<p><br>
By Monica Miller</p>
<p><br>
 <br>
Much has been in the news recently about La Raza, what a military intelligence acquaintance recently dubbed &#8220;a mestizo terrorist organization.&#8221; Republican congressman Charlie Norwood of Georgia&rsquo;s ninth district has called La Raza a &#8220;radical&hellip;pro-illegal immigration lobbying organization that supports racist groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is La Raza? The National Council of La Raza (its full name) is a pro-mestizo advocacy organization. The title &#8220;La Raza&#8221; is Spanish for &#8220;the race,&#8221; and its underlying rational is to support the interests of the mestizo race (people who are mostly Amerindian blood with a little Spaniard blood mixed in - people mostly from Mexico, Central America, and neighboring areas).</p>
<p>La Raza is anti-European in the sense that it opposes European Americans (whites) and favors the interests of indigenous mestizos. La Raza is notorious for supporting causes like amnesty, illegal immigration, birthright citizenship, chain migration, attempting to censor white journalists (most famously, Lou Dobbs), and removing white authors from schools to be replaced by mestizo authors.</p>
<p>Unknown too many is the financial support La Raza receives from donors like Wal-Mart, Exxon Mobil, McDonalds, and hundreds of other corporations. In more civilized times, these donations would be considered treason. But many of these corporations support La Raza for two reasons: they have bought into the religion of political correctness, and they want cheap labor. (Subsequently, I have not set foot in a Wal-Mart for over six years because of their support for La Raza - not to mention the fact Wal-Mart imports most of its goods from China and practices crony (tax-payer subsidized) capitalism.)</p>
<p>Also known too many are the sort of radicals attracted to La Raza. Just look at the statements of pro-immigration activist Jorge Sanchez:</p>
<p>&#8220;*Around the year 2040, whites will become a minority in the United States and, believe me, it will be payback time.&#8221;*</p>
<p>Related in name to The National Council of La Raza is the political organization La Raza Unida Party (RUP), roughly translated as &#8220;the party of the [mestizo] race.&#8221; To gain a sense of its anti-Western flavor, read the quotes of its founder José Ángel Gutiérrez:</p>
<p>&#8220;*We remain a hunted people. Now you think you have a destiny to fulfill in the land that historically has been ours for forty thousand years. And we&rsquo;re a new Mestizo nation.&#8221;*</p>
<p>&#8220;*Our devil has pale skin and blue eyes&hellip;&#8221;*</p>
<p>&#8220;*We have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill him.&#8221;*</p>
<p>We live in insane times. Only 30 years ago, La Raza would have been considered a treasonous organization, but now it&rsquo;s praised by anti-occidental leftists like Barack Hussein Obama and Sonia Sotomayor, and anti-occidental neoconservatives like Lindsey Graham and Linda Chavez.</p>
<p>Paul Starobin recently wrote in the *Wall Street Journal* that the United States has outlived its usefulness and it&rsquo;s now high time to break up into smaller countries. Perhaps he&rsquo;s right. Although some areas would be lost to the Third World, the remaining smaller pro-Western republics would be more immune to the lobbying efforts of terrorist organizations like La Raza.<br>

		<p>At the risk of seeming abrupt, rash, unthinking, etc. I have only one comment on this Sotomayer situation, which is quite simple to my mind. If the women is appointed a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, white men in the U.S. lose. They will lose in more ways than one could imagine. Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor has already set the program for white males, when she said that affirmative action needs at least another 25 years, and after that it might not be enough. Sotomayer wins, white males lose.  That&rsquo;s the  proper equation, to my mind.</p>

<p>Sounds nice in theory, but it isn&rsquo;t happening.  </p>
<p>First off, equality-obsessed leftists are the ones that want to take away people&rsquo;s &#8220;right to voice racial opinions,&#8221; if such opinions are right-wing ones expressed by whites.  Note the onerous &#8220;hate speech&#8221; laws in most white countries.  Such laws are rarely applied to non-whites.  And that &#8220;double standard&#8221; never bothers the white leftists.</p>
<p>The other problem is that you&rsquo;re confusing fairness (i.e. opposing double standards) and equality.  It is the leftist obsession with equality that isn&rsquo;t fair to its victims.  If you believe the races are equal, then you have no other choice to interpret inequality of outcome to some external problem, i.e. the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; doctrine.  For instance, the races are equal, but one race does way better than the other on a firefighters exam.  Ipso facto, the exam is the problem.  And therefore, the results of the exam are thrown out, with no thought to unfair this is to those who passed the test because they had the intellect and the sense enough to prepare.</p>

<p>Both parties claim that the Hispanic vote is crucial to win elections.  Since Hispanics and their culture are toxic to America the only way to keep the alleged election results in the hands of non-Hispanics is to drastically reduce the numbers of Hispanics in America any and every way we can.  If we don&rsquo;t the Globalist election puppeteers will eventually claim that Hispanics now decide the outcome of our elections and the rest of us may as well stay home&hellip;.    <br>

Flaxen-haired strumpet got it exactly right. It&rsquo;s mangled Spanish by a semi-literate graffiti artist who&rsquo;s trying to say &#8220;neighborhood (or community) yes; yankees no! These people are not educated in Spanish and are just doing the best they can. You have a lot of this in France with the Africans too who have evolved their own pidgin or patois.  Off that the French (who are notoriously sensitive about their language) don&rsquo;t complain about this.  It would be &#8220;racist&#8221; I suppose.<br>

<p>&#8220;For the benefit of those who do not speak spanish, please translate &#8216;La Raza&rsquo; means in english.&#8221;</p>
<p>A further question to ask would have been:</p>

&#8220;Sotomayor is not a Mexican and has no history of agitating specifically for Mestizos, but a much broader spectrum of &ldquo;Hispanics.&rdquo; She herself is reportedly Puerto Rican, though ethnically she seems a bit of a mystery to me as she looks for all the world identical to my Jewish/European neighbor, and like few Puerto Ricans I have ever known here in NY&hellip;go figure!&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
 <br>
I believe you&rsquo;re way off the mark in trying to establish some mysterious crypto-Jewish roots.  The name is a Spanish one with no Ashkenazic connection whatsoever. (I have written about this before and won&rsquo;t bother doing it again.) The other comments about Marranos in the New World are valid. Generally, they were not allowed to settle in the new territories, which were for Christians only,  but they did anyway. Medellin, Colombia, and Monterrey, Mexico were founded by crypto-Marranos.</p>
<p>In the case of Puerto Ricans, they have a certain small element of Taino aboriginal  blood in them, and I can see in her quite a bit of it. Just look at the eyes. The Indian element is very evident    &mdash;   much more so, in fact, than in most Puerto Ricans.  Most are mulattoes to some attenuated degree, but she is a mestizo (or &#8220;mestiza&#8221; in her case).  I see no trace of Africa in her at all. However, unlike Mexicans, Puerto Ricans don&rsquo;t think of themselves as mestizos, but rather as a mixture of three elements   &mdash;   Spanish being predominant in most (but not all).</p>
<p>Her face says to me she is fundamentally Caucasian (Spanish) with a touch of Taino. Looking for Jewish background is probably barking up the wrong tree. Anyway, Sephardic Jews (Spanish Jews) were quite another thing from Ashkenazic Jews. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s conscious of any mestizo roots (and I rather doubt it) or that she feels any common empathy with Mexicans. Puerto Ricans and Mexicans are two quite different groups having little in common beyond their background as Spanish colonies. Does the US feel any common identity with British Honduras?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right on, guy, about placing valid racial disputes for the first time in Congress, concerning a non-white.  Obama followed that clumsy maneuver with the incident about the racist Gates and effectively raised the race issue for dinner table conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was hoping he would do, as well as introducing race into white American households as a subject of legitimate debate, which will negate the subject as a &#8220;racist&#8221; one.</p>
<p>But we still have a long way to go before whites begin to complain about racial privilege and injustice as it concens themselves, but everything has to begin with prepatory dialogue and we&rsquo;re in the process of that, thanks to Obama and black racists like Gates who can&rsquo;t keep their mouths shut.</p>
<p>Did you ever think we would be watching experts on television expound on the fact that Obama is a racist?  </p>

		<p>#24 Gayle, said, &#8220;What is it about white men that continue to sell out their won race? A very good question. However, while everyone is focusing on what Sotomayor may or may not do as a Supreme Court Justice concerning whites, they need to remember one thing as I pointed out in my earlier post. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor, was the decisive vote to extend affirmative action, quotas, etc. and then she said, that it might be needed for another 25 years to &#8220;level&#8221; the playing field, and even then it might not be enough.</p>
<p>Apparently,sometimes it isn&rsquo;t just a question of what&rsquo;s wrong with white men, but also what&rsquo;s wrong with white women. </p>

		<p>Mention Jews and some people fly off the hook. Sotomayor does in fact look like two different Jewish teachers I had in Jr. and Sr. High. So what? Lots of people from one ethnic group look like they could be from another. If someone said she looked Italian there would be nary a peep from the PC crowd. What&rsquo;s important is that Sotomayor sees herself as &#8216;hispanic&rsquo; and puts her group, her &#8216;race&rsquo; above, in front, before all others. She sees whites as the enemy, all whites. That&rsquo;s the problem. The fact that such an unqualified person of not even average ability is a nominee for the Supreme Court shows how far this country has fallen. The fact that such an obvious tool for the behind the scenes Marxists running the show is a nominee for the highest court in the land shows just who is in charge. </p>
