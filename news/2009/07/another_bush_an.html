<h1><a href="https://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/07/09/another-bush-another-push-for-immigration-reform">Another Bush, Another Push for Immigration Reform</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Walter Shapiro, Politics Daily, July 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sometime around 6 a.m. Wednesday, the apologetic emails went out to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)  &mdash;  Jeb Bush&rsquo;s plane had broken down and he was stuck in Maine. For want of two wings, the former Republican governor of Florida was unable to fly to Washington to give lift and luster to the release of a <big>report</big> calling for comprehensive immigration reform.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that the CFR (an invitation-only membership organization filled with foreign policy mandarins) put together an immigration task force that ended up ratifying the establishment position on the issue. {snip}</p>
<p>What added drama was that presidential brother (and son) Jeb Bush was willing to serve as co-chairman of the CFR task force along with former Bill Clinton chief of staff Mack McLarty. At a time when few Republicans are willing to risk antagonizing the party&rsquo;s conservative base on immigration (paging John McCain), here was the most popular Bush in politics volunteering to stick his neck out. &#8220;Jeb Bush is such an important, vocal, leading Republican,&#8221; says Tamar Jacoby, the president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a national federation of employers championing immigration reform. &#8220;He&rsquo;s a very significant figure to come forward on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former Florida governor&rsquo;s physical absence Wednesday morning meant the loss of TV footage about the CFR report, but it did not diminish the political reality that Jeb Bush had endorsed this conclusion: &#8220;The Task Force recommends that a new effort to pass a comprehensive immigration bill be a first-tier priority for the Obama administration and Congress.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Over the next few months, the White House will decide whether there are enough likely GOP votes in Congress to risk making a major push for immigration reform before the midterm elections. {snip}</p>
<p>Immigration is that rare major issue on which the Bush family has always been on the liberal edge of the Republican Party. {snip} But most GOP conservatives opposed the president by denouncing any effort to legalize the status of illegal immigrants .  .  .  as &#8220;amnesty.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} As Jeb Bush put it in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson for Esquire, &#8220;The swing voters are Hispanic voters in most of the swing states. And the Republicans have done a poor job, sending signals that Hispanics aren&rsquo;t wanted in our party. Which is bizarre.&#8221; The same attitudes appear to have carried over to Jeb Bush&rsquo;s meetings with the task force. When asked about Bush, task force director Edward Alden said, &#8220;He&rsquo;s dismayed that elements of his party have taken such a strong anti-immigrant stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regardless of the partisan politics, there is a near-universal recognition that immigration reform is impossible as long as most Americans believe that the borders (and the gateway airports) are more Open Sesame than secure. In a recent interview with me, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano acknowledged that the voters need to know &#8220;that we have operational control of the borders.&#8221; The CFR report argues that this challenging goal is well on its way to being achieved: &#8220;The United States has made impressive strides in the past several years in strengthening its border enforcement measures.&#8221; {snip}<br>

		<p>I would rather have Obama in the WH than another Bush.  At least with Obama, the end will be a bit quicker, and we can get on with forging something new and different.  Mainstream Republicans, and their cheerleaders (Limbaugh, Bennett, Hannity et al), are why the Republican party is essentially irrelevant, today.</p>

		<p>Jeb Bush is a weird guy. He drops out of sight, and here he is.<br>
Fighting for unrestricted immigration. There are drugs and God knows what in his own family. His brother will be remembered as a total failure from both liberal and conservative views.</p>
<p>My reaction is:  Who cares what this loser thinks? Is the CFR stuck in the past circa 1991, when &#8220;Bush&#8221; meant something to some people? As for the borders being shut, that&rsquo;s only one issue, not the most important. </p>
<p>The Democrats and the Chamber of Commerce(Bush types) are trying to kill EVERIFY and other measures that identify illegals on the job and get them fired. That&rsquo;s how to winnow these parasites out. Where&rsquo;s &#8220;Jeb&#8221; on that issue?  </p>
<p>Seems to me I see lots of illegals every time I go to Florida, so &#8220;Jeb&#8221; didn&rsquo;t do too much checking of all those construction workers, maids, waiters, busboys and kitchen workers. And he didn&rsquo;t mind paying billions passed on to taxpayers for all the anchor brats the Hispanics and Haitians dump on the lousy school system &#8220;Jeb&#8221;, Mr. Education, imposed on Florida.</p>

		<p>Something is endorsed by Jeb, George, and the CFR.  Those are the three best reasons not to do it, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Translated into English, the &ldquo;three central components&rdquo; that Bush and McClarty means this:  (1) cheap labor for big corporations, (2) what need will there be for a border patrol if you&rsquo;re just gonna let everyone in?  It&rsquo;s like legalizing drugs then boosting funding for the DEA.  (3)  Since there will be amnesty, there will be no &ldquo;unauthorized workers,&rdquo; and therefore no employer will be hiring &ldquo;unauthorized workers,&rdquo; since they&rsquo;ll all have amnesty; same point as I made in (2).</p>
<p>As far as the most fundamental issue, a question I have had in my mind, one that I have never had answered with any credibility, is this:  Why are we to think that we somehow have an obligation to give a &ldquo;path to citizenship&rdquo; to people who sneak into the country?  If I sneak into Mexico, nobody with any real authority is going to think that I deserve a &ldquo;path to citizenship,&rdquo; I would get my ass jailed and then deported.  And by &ldquo;deported,&rdquo; I mean actually returned to the United States, not the flimsy American definition.</p>

		<p>Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, has sugggested that, since illegal aliens have supposedly been attacked by &#8220;American citizens&#8221; who are against illegal immigration, being against illegal immigration is therefore a &#8220;hate crime.&#8221; Boy, I thought George Bush Jr. was out of line when he called Americans against illegal immigration &#8220;vigilantes&#8221;. At least his attitude, unlike Feinsteins, wouldn&rsquo;t get Americans jail time for being against illegal immigration. The Democrats are proving, once again, where the tyrannts and radicals are.</p>

		<p>Does anyone here think that Jeb Bush is an important, leading Republican! I certainly don&rsquo;t. He showed his hand when he stated - &ldquo;The swing voters are Hispanic voters in most of the swing states&#8221;. So it IS about votes, NOT about whats good for our country and culture. He&rsquo;s a good example of why I will probably never vote Republican again. He&rsquo;s also for affirmative action. Jeb needs to understand that we want REAL men with backbone to lead this country, not limp wristed wimps like him. Like his loony-tune brother George, he&rsquo;s never worked a hard day in his life and won&rsquo;t be effected by any amnesty. Try going to their homes, I bet you couldn&rsquo;t get with-in a few blocks of them before you&rsquo;d be confronted by law enforcement. And then there&rsquo;s that &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; [yeah right] you&rsquo;d have to get around also. When idiots like Jeb are driven from the party, I will return. Until then, we are ripe for an independant party along the line of Britains BNP.     </p>

		<p>How&rsquo;s this for reform?  Secure the borders, heavily fine and I mean HEAVILY FINE the employers employing the illegals, round them up, including the anchor babies both past and present and send them home. Period!  Do not pass go, do not collect $200.</p>
<p>Vote out any traitor politician that subscribes to anything less than the measures stated above.  The browner the USA becomes, the closer we get becoming a third world nation.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Jeb Bush signs onto CFR drive for amnesty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reagan helped offset the ruinous liberal damage Carter made during his inept tenure, and at least set the country on a more conservative path.</p>
<p>This all changed with Bush I in office.  His social liberalism chased twenty million citizens to Perot and Clinton got in, and he did immeasurable damage to the conservative tenants of this country put in place by Reagan.</p>
<p>Bush II gets elected and destroys the Republican party almost all by himself with his unnecessary war, killing 100&rsquo;s of thousands of civilians and thousands of American soldiers in the process, and if that wasn&rsquo;t enough to drive away support for Republicans the fool backed amnesty for illegals trying multiple times to get them citizenship.  He was the cause for losing both chambers of Congress and driving away social conservatives and those who saw the war he created as nothing less than a criminal act.</p>
<p>Now, old Jeb is stepping up to the plate with more of the same. It&rsquo;s rumored he may well run for pres in 2012.  I guess what PaPa and big brother didn&rsquo;t destroy is going to be left up to him to finish off.</p>
<p>Establishment retards and backroom political hacks, who decide who will run for president, always come up with someone who would fit in better at the car wash than the presidency.</p>
<p>Third party or NOTHING.</p>

		<p>Yeah q Reagan certainly did set the country on a &#8220;conservative&#8221; path. </p>
<p>If by conservatism you mean handing the economy over to Wall Street so millions of jobs could be outsourced and we could be taxed to bail out the banksters in the S&L; fiasco, then that was conservative. </p>
<p>If you mean amnestying 3.1 million illegals and their scofflaw employers, then that was conservative. </p>
<p>If you mean trashing the Bill of Rights via the &#8220;War on Drugs&#8221;, then that was conservative. </p>
<p>If you mean wasting trillions on weapons to fight the Soviet Union circa 1960, then that was conservative. I know I was defense worker, we were still building weapons to guard against mass tank attacks through the Fulda Gap.</p>
<p>Reagan was the ABSOLUTE STUPIDEST and WORST president we have ever had.</p>
<p>Otis Graham has document his stupidity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.otisgraham.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.otisgraham.com/</a></p>
<p>Juan Mann at VDARE has documented how bad Reagan&rsquo;s amnesty was.</p>
<p>It is also of note that Reagan looked the other way when meat packing companies used busses to bring in Mexican strikebreakers.</p>

		<p>The GOP does not even have to mention amnesty or &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; in order to obtain more Hispanic votes.  Polls of Hispanics voters have shown that amnesty was not even one of their higher priorities.</p>
<p>So why is Jeb Bush saying these things???  His arguments are simplistic and without substantiation; the GOP should advocate &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; or the GOP will lose elections?!?!  I suppose alienating the GOP&rsquo;s base that despises &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; is also politically astute.  In fact, it is political suicide for the GOP to allow more people into this nation, or legalizing others who have, never, never, voted for the GOP.</p>
<p>So is Jeb Bush mentally deficient, or is he unaware of the Hispanic&rsquo;s voting record over the years????  He merely repeats the big lie over and over again.  In my opinion, he is a pathetic shill for globalist interests, just as GW Bush was.</p>
<p>Trust no one, especially from the Bush family.<br>

		<p>Just remember that in late 2008, Jeb Bush characterized the GOP as an &#8220;old white guy&#8221; political party.  That&rsquo;s the kind of language we expect from NAACP, ADL, and La Raza, not a former Republican governor of Florida.  Not one Republican has been quoted as chastising Jeb Bush for his sexist and racial views.</p>

<p>Obviously by pulling for a third party I&rsquo;m not a GOP supporter.  And I made reference to a &#8220;conservative path,&#8221; which was correct.</p>
<p>And anybody who thinks Reagan was the stupidist president we&rsquo;ve ever had is forgetting the leftist policies of Carter and Clinton&hellip;BUT&hellip;.those are the ones you probably like. The ones now are so ignorant it isnt even necessary to point them out.  They speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I could definitively take your post apart, regarding logic, but why expend the time on someone who has misinterpreted what I&rsquo;ve written so far.  That wouldn&rsquo;t  be understood either.</p>
<p>Otis Graham?  I imagine he&rsquo;s the leftist radical of the day on the Huffington Post or the daily Kos.  </p>

		<p> When objective Historians finally write on the Decline and fall of America, a great deal of blame will be squarely laid upon the Bush family. Unfortunately, they along with the Clintons held power at a pivotal time in American history. Together they ruled for a combined 20 years with very little policy differentiation, 20 years of blunders/overspending/mass third world immigration/open borders/corruption and cronyism. </p>

He also invoked a policy for banks to require IRS forms be completed when withdrawing more than $10,000 from the bank at one time, allegedly to prevent money laudering which I despised.  BUT&hellip;&hellip;.  He DID put us on a &#8220;conservative path.&#8221;  Do you understand the concept? </p>
<p>Did you also fail to understand that I&rsquo;m an advocate of a THIRD PARTY?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a few people on here who don&rsquo;t understand a post or are so naive they expect to only push for the perfect person that will appease all their prejudices.</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t gonna happen kiddies.  What is it you want?  All blacks to leave? A pres in office who is a White Nationalist?  It ain&rsquo;t gonna happen.</p>
<p>Conflicts are won by having the best game plan and sometimes that game plan requires the use of surrogates to move gradually in the proper direction.  And in the process of that a final satisfactory conclusion MIGHT be reached.</p>
<p>But, not in our case.  We&rsquo;ve gone too far already.  The die is cast.  There&rsquo;s no such thing as &#8220;returning&#8221; the country to any part of history somebody prefers.  The game is over.</p>
<p>I know.  I know.  I&rsquo;m advocating third party and then claiming we&rsquo;re finished, but it&rsquo;s more an exercise in an exchange of ideas than something that is based in realism.  </p>
<p>Bye bye Miss American Pie.  And not even Otis Graham or Harley Knuckleknocker can save us now.  <br>

<p>I have to disagree slightly.  Ronald Reagan was the best President of my lifetime.  Though, being as my lifetime started at Jimmy Carter, that&rsquo;s not a very high bar to flop over.</p>
<p>But I do agree that we have to stop the Reagan idolatry.  Republicans will never win Reagan&rsquo;s home state again b/c of the amnesty Reagan signed.  Another amnesty ends the Republican Party forever, though that might not be the worst thing in the world.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When asked about Bush, task force director Edward Alden said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dismayed that elements of his party have taken such a strong anti-immigrant stand.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His Party&#8221; advocates the rule of law in this country, no naturally, they also advocate enforcement of the law. The elements in his own party (referenced above) are NOT anti-immigrant&hellip;.they are anti-illegal alien. The Open Borders crowd does everything possible to equate illegal aliens with immigrants. Illegal aliens are not immigrants, they are criminal invaders, often colonists for their home country.</p>
<p>This article conveniently avoided mentioning that Jeb Bush sleeps with a Hispanic every night (being married to one). His kids are half-Hispanic. And he is governor of one of the most Hispanic states in the Union, in large part due to the votes of Hispanics.</p>
<p>So we are left with the idea that Jeb Bush is by no means biased toward amnesty&hellip;..in order to keep getting elected in Florida&hellip;.in order to keep peace in his own household?</p>

<p>Presidential campaigns have already become just that   &mdash;   Made for TV quasi reality shows.  The reason is that both parties agree on so many fundamental issues that are so bad for the American white working middle class.  What they argue about are mostly trivialities.</p>
<p>If they sound like they have your interests, they usually don&rsquo;t.  The Republican &#8220;Southern Strategy&#8221; (i.e. white strategy) was a Nixon concoction to head off George Wallace.  Lee Atwater mastered it to elect and out and outright plutocrat in the person of George H.W. Bush.  It as all a scam and a show to get white votes.</p>
<p>Likewise, David Axelrod&rsquo;s schemes are just as bad.  He came up with the triangulation that Barack Obama would &#8220;end tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas,&#8221; in order to trick enough white working class voters in swing states like Ohio to make the difference.  The scam of it is that even if such tax breaks eliminated (which they really won&rsquo;t be), the labor is that much cheaper in Bangalore and China, such that &#8220;removing the tax breaks&#8221; is like taking a cup of water out of the ocean.  Not only that, Obama wants a free trade zone in northern Pakistan, where textiles and clothing would enter the US tariff-free, which would end American textile manufacturing facilities.  He wants that out of the curious theory that if Pakistanis had slave wage jobs sewing t-shirts, then they wouldn&rsquo;t join AQ/Taliban.  That&rsquo;s the same nonsense that they spew with black gangs   &mdash;   if they only had minimum wage burger flipping jobs, they wouldn&rsquo;t join gangs.  Except that terrorism and gangs ARE their jobs, respectively.  You think that these AQ and Taliban types strap backpacks full of explosives on their backs to kill busloads of Jewish children for nothing, do you?  OBL takes care of their families.  Likewise, dope dealing IS the job for black American domestic gang bangers.  Illicit, illegal, and depending on your moral code, immoral, but a job nonetheless.</p>

		<p>When the Republican Party Nominated John McCain as their Candidate for President, I knew that they decided to commit Political Suicide. </p>
<p>Most people voted for McCain, ONLY to Block the Election of an Overtly Socialist Obama, not because they believed that McCain was a great choice. </p>
<p>I knew that McCain backed Amnesty for Illegal Aliens, and signed on to the Ted Kennedy-Obama plan for implementing it. </p>
<p>Just how &#8220;Conservative&#8221; can you be, if you sign on to what Ted, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll have another drink&#8221; Kennedy is proposing?</p>
<p>McCain, like is opponent, Obama, are both members of the CFR. So was every other Candidate that was running for President, minus Ron Paul, Mike Gravel, and Dennis Kucinich.</p>
<p>The Media never showed Primary Election results for Ron Paul, at any time. They purposely tried to remove him, and his name, from the view of the public. And they were successful. </p>
<p>Ron Paul ran the majority of his Presidential Campaign from the Intenet, with his &#8220;Campaign for Liberty&#8221;. </p>
<p>I wrote-in Ron Paul, on Election Day. I certaily would not vote for a traitor like McCain, and Obama was not even a consideration. </p>
<p>If more people had done what I did, or if Ron Paul had accepted the Nomination from the Constitution Party, he would have mopped the floor with Obama, and we would not be sitting here, with Trillions more in debt, an imploding Dollar, and extended  Socialism throughout our daily lives. </p>

		<p>q I understood perfectly what you meant. You meant that Reagan was conservative simply because YOU don&rsquo;t know what conservatism is. You listen to Rush limbaugh or Sean Hannity, and that as far as you know about conservatism. You think Reagan was conservative and Carter liberal. How so, what did Reagan conserve (the root word of conservatism)?<br>
Do you remember Carter&rsquo;s malaise speech? What was more conservative than telling us we were living beyond our means and it was time to tighten our belts for awhile?</p>
<p>Yes Reagan talked a good game but he was an empty suit that was lucky, Carter appointed Paul Volker for FED chairman and it was Volker who stopped the inflation. Reagan started at the end of a once in a lifetime bear market so everything had to look like it was going up.</p>
<p>You show your ignorance by the usual nonsense of calling everybody who disagrees a liberal thinking that means you won the arguement like the liberals calling someone a racist to end an arguement they are losing.</p>
<p>I voted for Ron Paul and donated the limit to his campaign. I have never voted Democrat. However, I know an empty suit when I see one and I also have enough brains to see cause and effect and when luck is at play. Reagan was an empty suit who was delt a lucky hand.</p>
<p>Of coure you didn&rsquo;t even bother to read Otis Graham, calling him some kind of a lefty. He is a scholar who documented Reagan&rsquo;s culpability in the amnesty.</p>
<p>Reagan&rsquo;s conservative bonafides:</p>
<p>Tripled the national debt</p>
<p>Criminaly used the CIA to bring drugs into the US</p>
<p>Let wall Street and the banks run wild and loot the treasury</p>
<p>War on drugs resulting the SWATization of police departments and assault on Bill of Rights because of it.</p>
<p>Did nothing about affirmative action.</p>
<p>Amesty for illegals.</p>
<p>Free trade started under Ron - The Canadian American Free trade Pact negotiated under him.</p>
<p>Looked the other way while conpanies used illegals to break unions and destroy communities</p>

<p>And your seething rage toward the Reagan White House makes me think it&rsquo;s personal.

		<p>Its refreshin to witness the rebirth of Hispanic power in this country. It is long overdoo. I am hopeful that Pres. Obama or Bush (Jeb) will introduce a Comprehensive solution to the immigration crises. Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics all have a vested interest in the Comprehensive reform which is one of the few guarenteed solutions to the current economic crises. Without jobs, minories cannot work and feed their families and hence, will have no &#8220;power&#8221;.  Or &#8220;food&#8221;.  Comprehensive reform will provide the jobs, raise wages, and incraese the standard of living among these groups. I wish most were astute enough to realize it.</p>

		<p>Sorry Question Diversity I worked in the defense industry under Reagan. I am just sick of constantly hearing how great he was when I know what an idiot he really was. I saw the waste of his defense spending every day. </p>
<p>I (unlike most Americans paid attention) and knew how he let businesses ignore the laws they didn&rsquo;t like. I am also an American firster and don&rsquo;t think it is in our national interest to destroy the lives of blue collar workers so the investing classes can get a better dividend.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like offshoring and outsourcing - all things that were the result of his simple-minded belief in &#8220;free trade&#8221;.</p>
<p>Read Murray Rothbard on Reagan. More and more people are starting to admit Reagan was no conservative. Hell, even Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s old magazine TAC has had a few articles along that line.</p>

		<p>q - It is simple, Reagan WAS the stupidest president EVER. I don&rsquo;t think that is even debatable. He NEVER accomplished anything on a cerebral level in his life. He could hit his mark and repeat his lines and that was it. Even the hated Jimmy Carter got an engineering degree from the Naval Academy and reached the rank of Commander in the Nuclear Navy. </p>
<p>The worst president is not mutually exclusive with the stupidest. You can be both, but I was being generous. Some president before my time may have been worse but could never be as stupid as Reagan.</p>
<p>I only commented on your post because you seemed to think Reagan lead us out of some liberal wasteland that Carter had us in and Ronnie showed us the conservative promised land and it was somehow all destroyed by Clinton. I wanted you explain what Reagan did that accomplished this? By doing so, you would realize, like many conservatives have lately, that Ron really wasn&rsquo;t one and that he is the main reason we have the problems we do today.</p>

<p>I hate to break the news to you, but most Presidents aren&rsquo;t the beacons of intelligence.  Jimmy Carter was probably among the highest IQ Presidents we had, but what did it get him?  Yes, he did appoint Vockler to the Fed, and that was the end of Keynesianism and the beginning of Friedmanite Monetarism.  Other than that, I will defend Reagan with this:  A Jimmy Carter appointed judge ordered a white teenage girl to attend an integrated high school at the point of a bayonette. (The source for that was a 1979 or 1980 issue of THE CITIZEN magazine, a publication put out by the Citizens Councils of America.)  A Reagan judge would have never done that.</p>
<p>Going back to your post number 33, you said something that flew right by me at first.  It was the part about the CIA bringing in drugs.  Mainly, those theories involved an investigative report in the San Jose Mercury News in 1995 or 1996.  It involved the CIA trucking in crack cocaine into the ghettoes.  The black excuseologists had a field day, not cognizant of the fact that there was an easy way to break this CIA conspiracy   &mdash;   don&rsquo;t take or deal crack.  Simple as that.</p>
<p>But my point is more fundamental than that.  Is it possible that the CIA is aware of impulsive and hedonistic mores and ways of life of black ghetto dwellers, and capitalized on that fact?  Yes.  But it&rsquo;s immaterial in my book.  Or, to put it another way, I don&rsquo;t care.  The reason is that most of these ghetto blacks got the money to buy the crack with government welfare checks, government make work &#8220;jobs,&#8221; and government mandated affirmative action jobs with private businesses.  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, all the CIA did was to recoup some of the government&rsquo;s own money for its black hat black box black suitcase black ops missions and budget. </p>
<p>Better that than the Pentagon paying $700 for a screwdriver or toilet seat, the overruns being siphoned off to the CIA.</p>

<p>q:  Then why didn&rsquo;t you list the things that would provide information for your argument?  All you did was shreik hysterically about hating Reagan.  And quote me the passage about my describing a &#8220;wasteland.&#8221;  And, yes, Clinton DID stop the momentum established by Reagan.  That&rsquo;s so obvious to most people no argument is necessary.  </p>
<p>And, yes, as well, to the fact that Clinton DID destroy the momentum of the conservative tone throughout the country SET BY REAGAN.   And, Carter and Clinton both introduced liberal concepts that started the ball rolling for the radical liberal agenda we see right now in Washington.  </p>
<p>I enjoy debating a topic, but not with someone who can&rsquo;t understand much and can&rsquo;t logic in coherebnt terms, nor do I like to exchange ideas with somebody that refers to statements that were never made as you did above.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I said about Reagan:</p>
<p>&#8220;Reagan helped offset the ruinous liberal damage Carter made during his inept tenure, and at least set the country on a more conservative path.&#8221;</p>
<p>q: That&rsquo;s exactly what happened.  There&rsquo;s nothing you posted that offered any argument to the contrary, but a bunch of nonsensical slurs.</p>
<p>Mark:  &ldquo;I am sure there were worse presidents, I don&rsquo;t know who, I wasn&rsquo;t alive then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>q: You&rsquo;re certain there were worse presidents, but you don&rsquo;t know who? Well, if you don&rsquo;t know who, then how would you know if there were worse presidents? I mean, you wrote you were SURE there were. </p>
<p>And if the reason you &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know who&rdquo; might be worse, because you weren&rsquo;t alive then, does that mean you know nothing of Lincoln, Jefferson, Washington and many other historical figures, because you weren&rsquo;t alive then?</p>
<p>People like you have no idea where they want to go.  You seem to be upset with the reference regarding the &#8220;ruinous damage&#8221; by Carter, yet there was a LOT of what he did that set the country on a course toward a liberal agenda.  Surely, you understand that Carter was probably every bit as liberal as Clinton, but not quite as liberal as Obama.</p>
<p>But, what makes the difference really?  No matter what any prior presidents did or didn&rsquo;t do isn&rsquo;t going to matter one iota now.  The sub-prime liberal agenda, put in place originally by Clinton,  has caused the world economy to go into collapse mode.  The game is over.  A depression level economy is only going to get worse, anybody who thinks we will get out of this mess without disintegrating into conflict and eventual break-up is an absolute fool.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity - Bringing up Carter&rsquo;s failings is irrelevant. Why, because he is a Democrat and he is supposed to be worthless. The fact that he was is to be expected. What wasn&rsquo;t to be expected was that Reagan was worse.</p>
<p>Carter gave us the stupid Mariel boatlift where we got all of Cuba&rsquo;s human effluent. It would seem to be impossible to waste such a big blunder but Reagan managed to top that blunder by taking in &#8220;refugees&#8221; (cheap labor, MS-13) from Central America that the death squads the CIA was helping create produced. This in addition to how many criminals among the 3.1 million illegals he amnestied. Carter&rsquo;s blunder could have destroyed the multiculturalists in their cribs but Reagan had his orders to flood the country with cheap labor.</p>
<p>There are many more instances. The &#8220;myth&#8221; of Reagan is kept alive by the RNC because they have been sucessful in using the name recognition to trot out one clown after another all claiming to be Reagan&rsquo;s reincarnation. It does us no good to perpetuate the myth. Dubya WAS Reagan II in every way - he just got more people killed in a stupid foreign adventure than Ron, and he didn&rsquo;t get his amnesty.</p>
<p>There used to be this wonderful WN website (no not stormfront) where one could go and see the latest WN information from around the world. Maybe you saw it. They had those two German-American girls who sang at WN rallys. The guy who ran it was indicted for child pornography and the site was shut down. I hope he was set up by his enemies and can prove it and that he wasn&rsquo;t a real perv. They had a wonderful biography on Reagan that took about three hours to read. It wasn&rsquo;t very kind to the Gipper. I wish I had copied those pages, I would love to share them with all the Reagan worshippers in the WN community.</p>
<p>By the way I don&rsquo;t consider myself WN. I am for stopping immigration, stoping laws that force people to integrate against their will, and against affirmative action type programs. I am for traditional conservative ideals family, community, and country first. I see the value in one generation sacrificing to make sure the traditions can be carried on by the next.</p>
<p>Oh, and the part about not caring that the government breaks its own laws to achive some ends that you agree with is a dangerous game. When the time and need comes, they will find a crime for you.</p>

		<p>This article should make anyone with have a brain feel like throwing up. The writer of it clearly needs shock treatments if he can speak with a straight face of Jeb and Slick collaborating on anything voters really want. (Jeb is liberal enough, but Slick?) </p>
<p>Shapiro gives no clue as to the exact STANCE of any of the players on the issue   &mdash;   what KIND of &#8220;reform&#8221; is at hand. But any fool should be able to see it&rsquo;s all just doublespeak and psychobabble for &#8220;same stuff, different day&#8221; in a further attempt to hoodwink the people on a life-or-death issue the politicians will never resolve if they can help it. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know why I&rsquo;m bothering to comment, because this piece is *such* refried, warmed-over, zombified feelgood liberal rot (the writing and the stuff it&rsquo;s about). Look at the last paragraph, especially the first sentence. What, the poor politicians can&rsquo;t fix the problem as long as the citizens feel the need is urgent? That has to be a dead giveaway that the only &#8220;reform&#8221; they&rsquo;re talking about is dropping all pretense of a border and welcoming the rest of the third world to this ex-country wholesale. That, to libs and commies, is progress. </p>
<p>Sorry, Janet, but just because a freshly minted liberal deity like you says something doesn&rsquo;t make it suddenly so. <br>

		<p>I can think of no family, with the possible exception of the Roosevelts or the Kennedys, which has contributed more to the diminution of this nation than the Bushes.</p>
<p>From the patrician but tongue-tied George Herbert Bush, who set about dismantling the Reagan Revolution immediately upon taking office, to his grinning idiot son George W. Bush, who presided over the greatest Federal spending spree in history and got us into two military quagmires early in his first term, and now good old Jeb, who apparently wants the entire populations of Mexico and Central America to be granted US citizenship, the Bush family has wrought more sheer devastation upon our nation than the entire criminal Democrat Party combined.</p>
<p>It was disgust with George W. that put the current lip-bibbling witless Marxist ninny in the White House and the Democrat Party firmly in control of both houses of the congress.</p>
<p>Hopefully the Bush name has become so tarnished that it will effectively prevent any more of them from attaining public office in any form.</p>

		<p>How can you defend Reagan?  He gave amnesty to millions of non-white illegals.  He never did anything pro-white.  We have to stop thinking of ourselves as &#8220;conservatives&#8221; and build our own movement.  </p>

		<p>God, how I hate the Bushes!   Now even more than ever. </p>
<p>In fact, I despise them just as much as the Kennedy&rsquo;s. <br>
 <br>
Which family has been worse for America? I don&rsquo;t know. Both of these &#8220;dynasties&#8221; - at either end of the political spectrum - have been disasters for the country.</p>
<p>As others have said above, we have to stop thinking in terms of &#8220;liberal&#8221; and &#8220;conservative&#8221;.  These old-fashioned terms have become  mis-leading and meaningless, and neither one takes into account the issue of race. Politics have taken on a new dimension.  What we need is is a whole new way of thinking.</p>

<p>Bullseye!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the situation in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Also, it was the liberal policies of the first Bush that allowed Clinton in.  20 million social conservatives flocked to Perot.  &#8220;Read my lips, no new taxes,&#8221; had absolutely nothing to do with it.  Nothing.   </p>
<p>Bush II destroyed his own party better than any of the opposition ever could.  </p>

		<p>#48 I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with your post. One thing many people overlooked about the Bush Clan, for the longest time was that they are not &#8220;conservatives&#8221;. They are as far from being conservatives, as your average college professor. No, except for a few issues that benefitted the Bush Family personally, like Bush&rsquo;s father pushing certain tax incentives for the rich, THE WHOLE FAMILY IS AS LEFTIST AS THE KENNEDY CLAN. They believe in empowering the central government and as much as possible. </p>

&#8220;I personally have no problem with that if she is legal&hellip;it&rsquo;s the rest of his pandering policies of the Bush family that bothers me now.&#8221;   &mdash;  -  SKIP<br>
==================</p>
<p>Well, you may not consider her a &#8220;problem&#8221; (although that and her legality are not even at ISSUE here);  but problem or not,  she is the EXPLANATION  for the &#8220;pandering policies of the Bush family&#8221;.    I, personally, would consider that a problem.  A big problem!    </p>
