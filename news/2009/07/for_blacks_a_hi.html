<h1><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=8108921&amp;page=1">For Blacks, a Hidden Cost of Obama&rsquo;s Win?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexandra Marks, ABC News, July 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, a growing number of African-American scholars are questioning the cost of that victory.</p>
<p>These scholars recognize that Obama still enjoys extraordinarily high approval ratings among African-Americans. An April New York Times poll found the percentage of African-Americans with an unfavorable opinion of him was too small to measure. {snip}</p>
<p>But there is some concern that in Obama&rsquo;s efforts to transcend race and unite the country, the African-American community could inadvertently lose political clout in determining crucial social-policy issues  &mdash;  from education to healthcare  &mdash;  vital to its well-being.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the price of Obama&rsquo;s election? In part, it was that we can no longer talk about race explicitly around national policy issues, or at least [Obama] can&rsquo;t, without being accused of playing identity politics,&#8221; says Eddie Glaude, professor at the Center for African American Studies at Princeton University. &#8220;So the question is then: How do African-American communities engage issues in light of their particular experiences without being accused of pushing a racial agenda?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>An Awkward Dance</b></p>
<p>To date, it has been an awkward dance. Some African-Americans have faced a backlash for criticizing Obama. In April 2008, Tavis Smiley, a leading black commentator, abruptly left a popular morning show on Black Entertainment Television after he criticized candidate Obama. At the time, host Tom Joyner told listeners that Mr. Smiley couldn&rsquo;t take &#8220;the hate&#8221; coming from listeners. Smiley, who did not return requests for a comment, later cited fatigue as a reason.</p>
<p>Prominent African-American scholar Cornel West was asked recently if he&rsquo;d take a post in the Obama White House. His reply: &#8220;You find me in a crack house before you find me in the White House.&#8221;</p>
<p>On The Huffington Post, comedian Elon James White called Dr. West&rsquo;s comment &#8220;sheer lunacy.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Dr. West is part of a group of Black intelligentsia that see it as their job to step up and police President Obama on his dealings on Blackness.&#8221; West was in Europe and unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Michael Eric Dyson, another leading black intellectual, has also come under fire for suggesting on radio that Obama was &#8220;playing&#8221; black people. Dr. Dyson did not respond to requests for a comment.</p>
<p>At the same time, other leading African-Americans have been chastised for being overly uncritical. Professor Glaude says the community is experiencing a confusion typical of any political movement in the midst of a historic transformation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, Obama is regularly asked what he&rsquo;ll do about the black community&rsquo;s disproportionately high unemployment or inequities in education and healthcare. His response steers clear of racial references and focuses on the need to fix the economy. &#8220;[If] I don&rsquo;t do that, then I&rsquo;m not going to be able to help anybody,&#8221; he said at a June press conference.</p>
<p>Such answers frustrate some African-Americans, who would like a more direct response. Achieving racial equity, they say, demands significant change  &mdash;  more than Obama has yet enacted and more than is produced by the symbolism of a black man at the White House.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought not to be blinded by the fact that he looks like some of us,&#8221; says Bruce Dixon, managing editor of the Black Agenda Report. &#8220;We can&rsquo;t invest so much in the symbolism that we don&rsquo;t really pay attention to what &#8216;brother man&rsquo; actually says and does.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Signs of a Different Approach</b></p>
<p>But others say that Obama has already made racial issues, like civil rights enforcement, a top priority. He has increased by 18 percent the budget for the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division and reversed the conservative stamp on the division, which under President Bush brought only two cases of voter discrimination on behalf of African-Americans.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has also made its presence felt at the US Supreme Court. It supported the City of New Haven against white firefighters, whose reverse-discrimination case was recently decided by the high court in the firefighters&rsquo; favor. It also opposed the challenge to the Voting Rights Act by a Texas entity. In that case, the court voted to keep the 1965 act intact.</p>

		<p>I know this is heresy on this site, but I&rsquo;m actually glad Mr. Obama won.  Because now we can to blacks, &#8220;your problem isn&rsquo;t America&rsquo;s irredeemable racism; it&rsquo;s that you don&rsquo;t act like that guy.&#8221;<br>

<p>What that means is that the NAACP and similar groups are scared that they&rsquo;ll be viewed as superfluous anachronisms now that there is a black President.  Money won&rsquo;t be rolling in like it used to.</p>

		<p>This is why Obama wanted Holder as Attorney General.  The Justice Department will become the new Gestapo, filing lawsuits and going after every business, city, police and fire department that does&rsquo;nt have the &#8220;correct&#8221; percentage of blacks and minorities that they think there should be.  Of course, when it comes to real civil rights violations, like voter intimidation, as happened with the New Black Panther Party in Philadelphia, the Justice Dept. dropped the charges against them.  Change we can believe in.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks fear losing political clout if Obama &ldquo;transcends race and unites the country.&rdquo; </p>
<p>LOL!</p>
<p>I think he has a far better chance of dividing the country, because of his gowing obvious racist decisions.  Rush Limbaugh made that assessment today also.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I&rsquo;m looking for this administration to be responsible for causing more racial animus among whites than anyone opposing him could hope for.</p>
<p>Just look at how race-conscious he has made whites today who weren&rsquo;t that way before the messiah was elected.</p>

		<p>Most blacks want federal(easy) jobs and/or welfare. <br>
They want public schools that will graduate their kids even if they are illiterate. </p>
<p>In fact, whether it&rsquo;s Obama or Bush or McCain, it makes no difference. Blacks get gravy from the feds and high school diplomas for the asking no matter who is President. No doubt they&rsquo;ll ditch private insurance for federal health insurance if it&rsquo;s cheaper. </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like Obama telling their girls to keep their zippers closed and to study. They may say they approve of Obama, but they know he is white, the son of white leftists who sent him to Ivy League schools most blacks can&rsquo;t get near.</p>
<p>They will eventually hate his guts, no matter how many affirmative action or hate crime suits Holder brings. I suppose they identify with Michelle, but even she hangs with too many rich whites from Chicago.</p>
<p>The problem with Obama is that he is a white leftist radical with all the baggage including PC and diversity junk that entails. He&rsquo;ll favor the hispanic illegals over unemployed blacks. But if he has to sell out anybody for reelection, including &#8220;his&#8221; people, white people, or the entire American people, he will. His &#8220;black&#8221; genes are the least of his defects. </p>

		<p>BHO got to where he is by acting like a movie Black, not a real Black.  He no more wants a &#8220;Black agenda&#8221; befouling his image among non-Black voters than he wants to live in Harlem.  </p>

		<p>This is SUCH a non-issue. Obama&rsquo;s like any other Establishment figure, of any race: the non-white is always his prime concern. There will be no &ldquo;transcending race&rdquo;, no &ldquo;uniting&rdquo; an increasingly fragmented country. As always that&rsquo;s just talk. Blacks will get all the handouts and preferences they want and whites will continue to be demonized and discriminated against. Every single black failure will continue to be the fault of white people. Blacks are incapable of taking responsibility for their actions and coming to grips with their inherent flaws.</p>

		<p>I think blacks expected a lot of favorable (to them) discriminating against whites &amp; targeted handouts that would improve their bank balances and intimidation power. They know that&rsquo;s the only way for their social-economic status will rise out of the gutter.  The more of them that see this is not coming the more disenchantment - in fact, they are not so sure Obama even much likes &amp; respects blacks for the same reasons non-whites (and even many blacks) don&rsquo;t much like or respect blacks. He is half white and likely proud of it though he dare not say so.</p>

<p>As many amren posters have noted, even if all six billion people on this planet woke up tommorrow morning without the slightest hint of &#8220;prejudice&#8221; or hate within them, the Racism Industry would never admit it.</p>
<p>After all that would mean that &#8220;Racism, Inc&#8221;- the ADL, NAACP, SPLC, La Raza, etc.- would have to get real jobs, and far less lucrative ones at that.    </p>

<p>Your comments are not that heretical. Last November quite a few posters, myself included, opined that in some ways Obama in the Oval Office would be less calamitous than the ridiculous, open-borders p.c. RINO McCain.    </p>

		<p>What worries me even more than half of B.O.&rsquo;s color is his secret agenda of rushing God knows what past us at blinding speed, putting our lives and country smack dab in the middle of the World Order, erasing every liberty and freedom that we have left - which isn&rsquo;t much. Socialized medicine, gun control, financial control and speech control are already nipping at our heels now.</p>
