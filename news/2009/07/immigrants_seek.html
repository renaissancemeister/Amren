<h1><a href="http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/01/payback-time/">Immigrants Seeking Money They Sent Home</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Samantha Henry, AP, July 1, 2009</i></p>

<p>With the U.S. economy in a ditch, money-transfer agencies have been reporting a decline in the wages that immigrants are sending back to their home countries. Now, it appears that some immigrants are going a step further  &mdash;  asking their relatives to wire them money.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve never seen this before,&#8221; said Marlen Miranda, manager of Peerless Travel in Fairview, which runs a money transfer service. &#8220;I mean, one or two people might receive money for a special reason, but not this quantity of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Miranda said she has seen her customer base dwindle from 200 people to 75 who regularly use her money-transfer services each month. Of those 75, Miss Miranda said, about 20 now come in to receive money instead of sending it home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is not clear how much money is being sent back to the U.S. or how widespread the phenomenon is. Large money-transfer agencies, such as Western Union, said they do not disclose how much money is sent or received by their field offices. Banks in foreign countries usually track only money sent into the country by their citizens living abroad.</p>
<p>But clearly, these &#8220;reverse remittances&#8221;  &mdash;  as the money wired back to the U.S. is called  &mdash;  are extremely small compared with the money that immigrants send home.</p>
<p>Immigrants working in the U.S. sent more than $50 billion back to their native countries last year, according to the World Bank, which predicts the amount will drop 5 percent in 2009. Mexico&rsquo;s central bank said remittances sent to that country are down more than 18 percent in the past year and registered their biggest decline on record in April.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>World Bank economist Dilip Ratha said he devised his own measure of how much money is sent back to immigrants living in the U.S. and other countries. Analyzing foreign currency deposits in the Dominican Republic, Mexico and India from February 2008 to January 2009, Mr. Ratha found that immigrants from those countries tapped into their savings accounts  &mdash;  money they had previously wired home  &mdash;  at an accelerated rate as the global economy worsened.</p>
<p>The amount of foreign currency on deposit declined 7 percent in the Dominican Republic, 12 percent in India and 6 percent in Mexico during the 12-month period, Mr. Ratha said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Ratha said the surge in money wired back to the U.S. will not last long.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability of, let&rsquo;s say, a Mexican family or a Nepalese family to be able to send dollar remittances to maintain somebody to pay for living expenses in the U.S. or in Europe is very weak, because they are very poor,&#8221; Mr. Ratha said. &#8220;And the savings that are there of the migrants are also not very significant in most cases  &mdash;  so those savings will run out very quickly.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What has to be sent back, in the other direction, are the &#8220;immigrants,&#8221; not the money. Everytime the issue of illegal immigration seems to be reaching the apex of absurdity, there&rsquo;s still another step that takes the insanity higher.</p>

		<p>I wonder how much of the reverse remittances are actually narco dollars that had been smuggled out of this country.</p>

		<p>I agree Bob&hellip;&hellip;.send the third world trash back to their homes. Open immigration and multi-culturalism have destroyed American jobs, standard of living and cohesion yet the Govt. does nothing about it. Just goes to show that our Western Govts. are not on our side.</p>

		<p>Just as I began to read this article, TV&rsquo;s Fox and Friends started a debate on returning veterans who can&rsquo;t find a job. But jobs must be plentiful for the alphabet of visa holders who are admitted right and left. As long as one vet or one American is without a job, then there should be no one admitted to this country. The insanity will continue unabated until we stand up and fight. We take in more immigrants and visa holders than any country in the world. We need a moratorium on ALL immigration, then the enforcement of laws that would cause illegals to self-deport. Our borders must be secure and, if necessary, armed military on the border. Stop the &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; fiasco and all benefits immediately. We&rsquo;d notice a great drop in those breaking into our country and an absence of illegals very quickly</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s one reason and one reason only immigrants flock to this country and that is because they can earn more money here.  Research has shown that most all of them, Mexicans for example, had jobs in their own areas, but wanted more money.  Entire towns have relocated en masse to the US and are sitting vacant right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more a situation of greed, rather than need.</p>
<p>So how bad must the economy get before they return home?  </p>
<p>Pretty bad, because no brighter than they are they&rsquo;re looking for the &#8220;person of color&#8221; who is now president to put them first in line for everything, and they will be drawing whatever social benefits they can scam; scrounging, committing crimes, or whatever is necessary to wait out the time until the golden messiah moment arrives.</p>
<p>Look for much black/Hispanic down and dirty fighting in the next three years especially, much more so than what is occurring now.  They&rsquo;ll be fighting over what flesh might still be left on the American carcass.</p>

		<p>What amazed me when I traveled the West Coast of Mexico from Baja down into Central America was how well off Mexicans are. We have this idea they are all living in dirt hovels begging for tortillas and nothing could be further from the truth. A friend of mine got back from Africa and they said there are more luxury BMWs and Mercedes on the road there than in their hometown of Duluth Minnesota. I was surprised at the wealth of countries like Costa Rica as well and I traveled the entire country. We&rsquo;re not on top like we used to be any longer.</p>

		<p>#6 Unemployed Wasp, so true about Mexico. I have pointed this out a thousand times. Mexico is a rich but extremely corrupt nation. Those rich do not want to pay the taxes to support their population and so send huge numbers of them to El Norte, so Uncle Suckers citizens can foot the bill for them. Other benefits are that the beaches and landfills and forests, etc. of Mexico remain pristine while our nation is ruined with the environmental damage that overpopulation causes. It is all so hopeless, when one thinks of the huge, and truly clueless, numbers of Americans who  &mdash;  JUST DON&rsquo;T UNDERSTAND. </p>
