<h1>Fla. Justices: Crist Can&rsquo;t Reject White Judge Nominees</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, July 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Florida Supreme Court says Gov. Charlie Crist can&rsquo;t reject an all-white list of appeals court nominees, even though he wants to appoint someone who will make the judiciary more diverse.</p>
<p>The justices unanimously ruled Thursday that the Florida Constitution leaves Crist no choice but to pick one of the six white candidates submitted by a judicial nominating commission.</p>
<p>Crist refused to make an appointment to the Daytona Beach court after the commission refused to give him a more diverse slate. The 10-member court has no black judges.</p>
<p>Crist said he was disappointed by the ruling but respected it.</p>
<p>Justice Jorge Labarga wrote that the high court applauded Crist&rsquo;s &#8220;well-intentioned&#8221; interest in promoting diversity, but that the governor could not refuse making an appointment.<br>

		<p>The Florida Supreme Court is interesting in this case because one of its members is Charles Canady.  He represented a Florida congressional district during the years of the &#8220;Republican Revolution,&#8221; and tried over and over again to repeal Federal affirmative action mandates.  Nut Gingrich turned him away every time, and he eventually declined to run for re-election after several terms.  Now, he&rsquo;s on the FL Supreme Court, and it&rsquo;s pretty obvious how he voted on this one.  Payback is sweet.</p>
<p>I hope the Democrats pick a black man or woman as their Senate nominee for 2010.  This will put Crist in the worst bind.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s weird about this is, everytime I&rsquo;m before local court, and i&rsquo;ve been in a couple different states now, the judges are all non-white or women. My local court should sure use some more diversity!</p>

		<p>Crist is a liberal Republican who believes that &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221; (meaning pandering to minorities  &mdash;  mostly Hispanics) is the way to grow the party.  He doesn&rsquo;t realize that Republicans will never be able to out pander Democrats.  For my part, the Republican Party is hopeless.  It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if they never win another major election.</p>

		<p>Crist, like all the Republicrats, has been revieweing the Census Data and the exit polls and understands the situation.</p>
<p>The situation is that European-Americans vote the same percentages over and over and over again&hellip;to no avail.</p>
<p>The same percentage of European-Americans support the Demoncans and Repubics, in essence, they have cancelled each other out of the political picture.</p>
<p>Crist knows the he MUST start pandering to the invaders or his future is bleak.  Since European-Americans are so divided, our future is also bleak.</p>

 Crist may be as much responsible as anyone for the fact that<br>
this disasterous bunch occupies the White House. He went all<br>
out to campaign for McCain over Romney. McCain won the Florida<br>
primary and Romney dropped out of the race, thereby setting<br>
the stage for the miserable McCain-Palin ticket.</p>
<p> We&rsquo;ll never know what may have happened without Crist&rsquo;s<br>
intervention, but I continue to hold him responsible. </p>

		<p>In the past eight years of being sued I have been attacked by no less than 17 white lawyers, five of whom are judges.  This affair, which went all the way to the Supreme Court of Texas, is far and away the most vulgar experience of my life.  Looking back I can honestly observe that it was a collusion between the lawyers and judges, who used the sad plaintiff, to strip me of everything I own.  There was only one judge who ruled in my favor, a black man on the appeals court tribunal.  The other five judges did everything they could to misread the documents and misconstrue the testimony, always in favor other plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyers. </p>
<p>To suggest that we need more white judges as a cure for the present judicial system could not be further from the truth.  We need a new legal system for a real American Renaissance.</p>
<p>As proof of this it is the 100% white judge panel in Florida that has upheld every anti white, anti human ruling proffered by the legislature and lower courts.<br>

		<p>I agree with poster #7.  Whites are a big part of our problem.  We need to start chastising and ostracizing other whites for their lack of tribalism.  Alienate them, pure and simple.</p>
<p>As for Crist, I live in Florida and he is a useless traitor.  He tried to change the State song (Swanee River) because it was deemed racist and also tried to get felons the right to vote.  I sent him an email protesting both and never got a response.  When I called his office to demand a response, I was assured I would get one soon.  Well, two or more years later, guess what?  Still no response.  I do my best to turn every favorable vote for him into an unfavorable vote every chance I get.  I&rsquo;ll vote for a black-pandering black before I would ever vote for Crist.<br>

<p>Joege thinks it&rsquo;s so great that Crist&rsquo;s mind is &#8220;right.&#8221;  I wonder if it&rsquo;s because his name is Jorge and he received his appointment via affirmative action?</p>
<p>Also, shouldn&rsquo;t legal decisions cone down as strictly legal decisions, having nothing to do with regarding the case being ruled on as goo or bad?</p>
<p>This Crist is just like ALL the Bush dorks.  Every one of them is a liberal when it comes to social issues, but staunch conservatives if a matter has anything to do with effecting their wealth.</p>
<p>Our boy Crist has ambitions to run for the presidency.  </p>
<p>These bonehead voters in Florida put this Martinez into the Senate and the liberal Nelson.  Any by supporting this present administration they voted to have their retirement money wiped out by all this rabid spending, so I hope they enjoy going broke.  Nobody deserves it more.<br>
