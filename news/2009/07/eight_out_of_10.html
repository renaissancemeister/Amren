<h1><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5888701/Eight-out-of-10-Britons-want-immigration-cap.html">Eight out of 10 Britons Want Immigration Cap</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rosa Prince, Telegraph (London), July 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The findings of the opinion poll conducted by Mori will come as an embarrassment to ministers, after Alan Johnson, the Home Secretary, ruled out imposing a cap.</p>
<p>Just 13 per cent of those asked for their views on whether a &#8220;strict limit&#8221; on immigrant numbers should be introduced said that they opposed the move. Another 81 per cent were in favour, according to the poll by Ipsos MORI for the UK Border Agency.</p>
<p>There was also a sharp increase in the number who feared that immigration could have an impact on their own job prospects.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of those surveyed, 69 per cent, said that they considered immigration to be a big or fairly big problem. Among this group, there was a 20 per cent increase since the start of the recession in the number who considered that their position was at risk from immigrants.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of respondents described themselves as fairly or very dissatisfied with the Government&rsquo;s handling of the issue of immigration, with a slightly smaller number, 64 per cent, saying that laws should be tougher.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Mr Johnson told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee that he did not &#8220;lie awake at night&#8221; worrying about the prospect of the population hitting 70 million.</p>
<p>Campaigners claim that millions of new arrivals could flood into Britain, forming 70 per cent of the nine million increase in the population which they predict by 2028.</p>
<p>Ministers say that the new Australian points system allows in only skilled immigrants who benefit the country financially.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson told the committee that a cap would harm the economy, adding that Britons should &#8220;welcome&#8221; immigrants who came to live and work here, and that he was &#8220;happy&#8221; to live in a multicultural society.</p>
<p>He went on: &#8220;I do not lie awake at night worrying about a population of 70 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m happy to live in a multicultural society. I&rsquo;m happy to live in a society where we not only welcome those coming to live and work in this country, but also where we can go and live and work in other countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said the argument that immigration had made a contribution to the economy was &#8220;irrefutable&#8221;.</p>
<p>But, he added: &#8220;The argument gets more difficult when you get into hard economic times.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Ipsos MORI polled 1030 people aged 16 or over between February and March this year.<br>

		<p>A cap is not enough, sending all non-Whites back outside Europe is the only solution for Britain and every European nation. Mr. Johnson should leave Britain and live in pakistan or nigeria if he so wishes but the people of Europe have all the right to maintain their genetic and cultural uniqueness. By mixing with these non-White invaders, Europeans have nothing to gain but loose as the future multicultural Europe will be dirtier, poorer, uglier, stupider and possibly barbaric while the invaders have everything to gain.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to live in a multicultural society. I&rsquo;m happy to live in a society where we not only welcome those coming to live and work in this country, but also where we can go and live and work in other countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;We..welcome those coming to live and work in this country.?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, 69% of Brits do not &#8220;welcome&#8221; those coming to live here, which means by its very definition that the immigrants are unwelcome. It also means that the home-secretary is lying.</p>
<p>During the next election these statements should be repeated consistantly until the population is convinced of what a self-loathing anti-British imbecile he is. He should take his own advice and &#8220;go and live and work in other countries.&rdquo;<br>

<p>The global &#8220;free movement of workers and capital&#8221;  that he alludes to will replace race-based and nation-based societies with one global class-based society.</p>
<p>One would think centrists and leftists would have a problem with this new world order, but the fog of multiculturalism blinds them to reality. </p>

		<p>This reminds me of a survey I read a few months back in which various political positions were listed. The majority agreed with every single position&hellip;. until they were told it was the BNP platform. Stop beating your heads against a brick wall and just vote BNP.</p>

		<p>Another good reason why British people should vote for the BNP.</p>
<p>The BNP actually represents the interests of the native British population.</p>
<p>The British government is out of line with its population&rsquo;s will. If an overwhelming majority of British people don&rsquo;t want to see their nation turned into an overpopulated, multicultural cesspool and made minorities on their own soil, the government ought to implement the people&rsquo;s wishes (we are a democratic society, aren&rsquo;t we?). But the British government behaves in a totalitarian manner and ignores the people.</p>
<p>We have the same problem here in America. You can look at surveys on the Internet. Over 3/4ths of Americans want to see illegal aliens removed from our country, but our stubborn, effiminate government refuses to do a damn thing about it.</p>

<p>No, a cap would help the economy as it would return jobs to the natives. It would also cost a lot less in welfare benefits. Frankly, who is this Mr.Johnson to tell people what they should want? Who is he to force his views on a population that obviously doesn&rsquo;t want it? It is the will of the people that counts and if 80% want caps, then so be it. The will of the people should be what happens.</p>

		<p>He is &#8220;happy&#8221; to live in a multicultural society?  What insanity. HE doesn&rsquo;t live anywhere near these people!  This sounds like our government officials. They also don&rsquo;t care what WE think or want when it comes to nonwhite immigration. They will shove it down our throats and continue living in their protected White communities.</p>

		<p>High immigration is simply the price of the Anglo-Celtic race&rsquo;s triumph over other European countries.  Everyone speaks English, not German, remember?  I find it difficult to to feel sorry for the Anglosphere when they themselves created this situation and are the prime upholders of the so-called New World Order.</p>

		<p>	Britain&rsquo;s indigenous population is suffering under strains of multiculturalism; while sanctimonious politicians live in all white neighborhoods; send their children to all white schools the think nothing of condemning the white underclass to dangerous cities where white children are often targeted for attack by minorities.<br>
	</p>
<p>        I say, make Mr. Johnson and the rest of his liberal minded colleagues live amongst the refugees, make their children attend minority ridding schools&hellip; these liberals would soon change their tune on the benefits of multiculturalism. <br>

		<p>The commenter at the &#8220;number ten&#8221; comment says he doesn&rsquo;t feel sorry for &#8220;the Anglosphere,&#8221; since they have pushed for high Third World immigration and this globalist New World Order.   The problem with this comment is that it would seem to issue a sweeping contempt for all the white people living in Canada, America, Ireland, Great Britain, New Zealand and Australia (among whatever other little pockets of the Anglosphere I&rsquo;m missing here).  There are millions of white families in &#8220;the Anglosphere&#8221; who would like to see all this Third World immigration stopped, but have had their wishes thwarted by the Leftist Elites who want to destroy the West altogether.   No, save your contempt for the Leftist Establishment that is imposing these policies on millions of innocent white people.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the UK&rsquo;s Tory Party, but if they seized on the idea of an &#8216;immigration cap&rsquo;, then they will certainly absolutely crush Labour at the next election.<br>
In fact, I&rsquo;m willingly to wager that Labour&rsquo;s defeat will be so massive and overwhelming (it would probably pick up less than 15% of the vote), that its future as a political party would be in doubt.</p>

		<p>Knowing the politically correct general media and its outside associates, this poll probably also included the opinions of non-white planters as well.</p>
<p>If so, this would add even more significance to the 81% result since it couldn&rsquo;t be passed off as a <i>typically white &#8216;racist&rsquo; one</i>.</p>
<p>I suspect, the bulk of the 13% opposing the cap were traitorous white Marxist Liberal sympathisers and Muslims.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Homeland secretary says they(the British citizenry) won&rsquo;t get it though.&#8221; (a cap on immigration)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly the same in the U.S. We needn&rsquo;t keep thinking that we are somehow different. We are worse in fact. Two million people a year, is what the U.S. allows to immigrate. Two Million!!</p>
<p>Forty five years ago it was a mere 150,000!!  I have to wonder if most Americans realize this fact. If there was ever a time that they needed to realize it, it would be now. It&rsquo;s surreal, mindboggling, 2 million a year!!</p>

While the Tory&rsquo;s will be just as treacherous as Labour if it meets their political objectives, they will sell themselves as the &#8220;reasonable&#8221; alternative to the BNP. The media will probably even try to help them if only to sabotage the BNP.</p>

		<p>Mr Johnson said the argument that immigration had made a contribution to the economy was &ldquo;irrefutable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But, he added: &ldquo;The argument gets more difficult when you get into hard economic times.&rdquo;<br>
Irrefutable, you say? That&rsquo;s quite a claim, Mr Johnson. Even refuting every argument that you&rsquo;ve heard to the contrary wouldn&rsquo;t make yours irrefutable. Please show us this argument (which is not included in the article), along with proof of its irrefutability.</p>
