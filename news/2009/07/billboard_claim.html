<h1>Billboard Claiming Martin Luther King Was Republican Angers Black Activists in Houston</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Abrams, FOX News, July 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Who knew?</p>
<p>A billboard proclaiming that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican has stirred a religious and political hornets&rsquo; nest in Houston, where a church leader is trying to draw black voters into the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The jumbo-sized roadside ad made its contentious claim for about a week  &mdash;  until a local black activist charged that the sign unjustly politicized King&rsquo;s legacy and was hurting his community by telling a &#8220;blatant lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Luther King may have very well believed in some of the Christian principles of the Republican Party, but Dr. Martin Luther King was not a Republican or a Democrat,&#8221; said Quanell X, who heads the New Black Panther Party in Houston.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. King was bigger than a political party  &mdash;  he was a humanitarian, and so to attach him exclusively to any party is to devalue his humanitarian global status,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We were insulted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by the billboard because it was a blatant lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the founder of RagingElephants.org, the black conservative group that sponsored the sign, told FOXNews.com that the sign was designed to get blacks to rethink their political affiliation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, he said, the sign is accurate.</p>
<p>Kimau-Imani told FOXNews.com that King&rsquo;s niece, the Rev. Alveda King, has long argued that her uncle was a Republican, though he acknowledged there was no documentation or voting record to prove it.</p>
<p>Those claims enraged Quanell X, who held a press conference late last week to rally against the sign and ended up in a shouting match over the legacy of the murdered civil rights icon.</p>
<p>The billboard, which Kamau-Imani says cost $3,000 to display for a month, came down shortly after Friday&rsquo;s press conference  &mdash;  about 20 days ahead of schedule, a move Kamau-Imani attributed to the &#8220;spineless&#8221; response of the billboard company, SignAd.</p>
<p>&#8220;The simple fact is that the leader of the Black Panther Party here in Houston called a news conference and they spooked,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Quanell X told FOXNews.com he was pleased that he had succeeded in getting the billboard removed. He added that King would never have embraced the present-day GOP, which he said had &#8220;racist elements.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What went little noticed in the fray was the subtext on the billboard, which said that the Raging Elephants are committed to &#8220;leading America&rsquo;s 2nd emancipation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kamau-Imani told FOXNews.com that black voters feel that &#8220;your blackness, your street cred is tied up with whether you are a Democrat or not&#8221;  &mdash;  a notion he said amounted to a kind of mental slavery that keeps blacks from speaking freely.</p>
<p>The president of the Houston branch of the NAACP said that the civil rights group does not wade into partisan politics, but seemed pleased that the sign had come down.</p>
<p>&#8220;The community has prevailed,&#8221; said Carol Galloway, president of the organization&rsquo;s Houston branch.</p>

		<p>Even though the billboard is a flat out lie, and wishful (and delusional) thinking on the part of America&rsquo;s two black conservatives, and white neo-conservatives and lamestream conservatives, anything that outrages our good buddy Quanell X is fine by me.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King didn&rsquo;t seem to show any preference to one party over another through his life.  I would guess that in his early days, he might have preferred Republicans on a national scale.  Nixon (as Vice-President under Ike) was a big MLK booster.  But in his later years, he was probably a Democrat.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that the Republican Party was the racial liberal party (compared to the Democrats) from the end of the WBTS all the way up to 1960.  As monolithic as the black vote for Democrats is now, that&rsquo;s how monolithic it was for Republicans between the WBTS and FDR.</p>

<p>I always regarded King as a very small man who had an affinity for communism and plagerism.</p>
<p>And, does anybody REALLY care if Quanell X, the anti-white racist,is offended?  I mean anybody who counts?</p>

<p>With this one, I do not know if it is appropriate to: laugh, cry, or vomit?</p>
<p>What the hell have we come to?</p>
<p>That is the best question I can ask, but in the end, it is also silly a rather silly one. We here at AR all know about Comrade &ldquo;Saint&rdquo; Martin&rsquo;s dalliances and treasons; with this point made, I am clearly only an alter boy shouting, &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to the choir and the priests!</p>
<p>Delicately, with all the skill of a clumsy butcher with a meat ax, I will observe that the Republicans in Texas, were utterly degenerated imbeciles to even attempt this, or even to try to attempt this. When Dr. Francis called them the Stupid Party, he was being far too kind.</p>
<p>A basic political lesson is this, only one group ever votes Republican and that is whites. So long as a majority of voters is white, and a majority of that voting bloc goes Elephant, the Republicans remain viable.</p>
<p>End of discussion!</p>
<p>With one qualifier, in 2008 they should have learned from Multiculturalism and Tolerance 101 via Auto-Media Professor X, that no matter what they do, they are only portrayed as this my friends:</p>

<p>Yeah the GOP&rsquo;s treatment of Bobby Jindal and Michael Steele has been nothing nothing short of atrocious.<br>
And I&rsquo;m sure that Hillary Clinton would attest that race is not a issue at all in the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>I hope whoever coined the word &#8216;racist&rsquo; is happily giving Satan a foot rub right now.<br>
I&rsquo;m still convinced most people don&rsquo;t even know what the word means or implies.<br>
I keep thinking to myself that I have a universal definition of the word sussed, only to have it contradicted by a non-white in the media within a couple of weeks.<br>
Like Al Sharpton&rsquo;s representative saying &#8220;dumb rednecks&#8221; yesterday or some of Ms. Sotomayor&rsquo;s gems doing the rounds lately.</p>
<p>I get tired of this same old routine and I&rsquo;m on the other side of the planet and I&rsquo;ve only been following this for a couple of years.<br>
The real true believers of the White Rights movement who have been up to their necks &#8216;in it&rsquo; for decades, must have iron constitutions and the patience of saints!<br>
As it all drives me crazy!</p>

		<p>MLK Sr- not Jr.- endorsed Nixon for president in 1960 because of his opponent JFK&rsquo;s religion. MLK Sr. actually gave speeches in black churches warning of the dangers of a catholic becoming president.</p>
<p>However Daddy King switched parties right before the election after JFK helped gain his son&rsquo;s release from jail after a protest. </p>

		<p>When I was a boy, growing up in the South. The only Republicans were black or carpetbaggers from up North. The Republican party was the party of Abraham Lincoln, who freed the slaves, after all. No one thought it was strange at the time. It had been that way for almost a century.<br>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t consider that a compliment. Shysters like Nixon used the southern strategy to woo southern whites and make them promises that never came true. Like I have said in a previous post, any white person who considers Reagan as one of the greatest Presidents is a complete fool. Look at the Republicans who worship him today, a bunch of sniveling PC crybabies who put their damn pocketbook ahead of everything else in life. I seriously think a complete collapse at this point would be better for white people than 20 more years bread and circus.</p>
<p>Also, I find it hilarious that Mr. &#8220;Quanell X&#8221; is so offended that MLK may have voted republican. I suppose that most blacks do not realize that they had a lower illegitimacy rate than whites before their leaders jumped onto the beatnik/hippie bandwagon. Along with government replacing Dad, I can&rsquo;t think of one thing the democratic party has done to improve the situation of most black Americans, except retard what is a spritual/self-motivated progress.     </p>

		<p>Fact is, the most devastating policy towards blacks today is the free immigration of dirt-poor folks from around the world.  That policy is supported by 50% (or less) of Republican politicians, and 100% of Democrats.  So supporting Republicans is doing blacks a favor, if only by default.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s foolish to expect more than a handful of blacks to sign on to the GOP.  It would be a much better expenditure of one&rsquo;s energies to chase them out of the other party.  A moderate third party concentrated in black districts would be the best thing for  both blacks and whites in this country.  They could coalesce with conservative Republicans on points in common, like immigration, school reform, and life and marriage issues.</p>

		<p>I assume that the only reason most of the blacks want to be Republicans is so all their bases will be covered.  No matter where you look, there will be a black candidate to vote for.  I suppose some of them really believe in moral values, but the great majority just want a black, any black in office.  Well, I am not buying it for one minute.  There are other parties out there.  </p>

		<p>This has always been the dirty little secret of the democrats:  their &#8220;racist&#8221; history.  I&rsquo;m continually surprising people here in California, where I presently live, by telling them about my childhood in the &#8220;racist&#8221; south, particularly when I point out that, in that whole segregationist era, the statehouses were solidly democrat from the Potomac to the Rio Grande.  In fact, I remember the first republican I ever met, when I was 21 years old, in New Orleans, LA.  It was like finding a unicorn.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we all have another name for those bad old segregationist days:  we call them The Good Old Days.  Those were the days when women could walk the streets at night with impunity, and you could send your four-year-old child on errands, all by himself.  Everyone&rsquo;s children were allowed to play outside, with no worries about it.  I also remember it as a time when children in schools actually received an education, and could read, write, and do complex math by the time we were halfway through elementary school.</p>
<p>Then, those republicans in Congress passed the Civil Rights laws, in 1965, and the decay commenced.  So no wonder MLK, Jr. was a republican.</p>

<p>What do you mean, &#8220;were&#8221; the days?  That sounds like life today in my hometown, and in hundreds of other rural counties in the Northeast and Midwest  &mdash;   which have been Republican since John C  Frémont&rsquo;s day.  And lily-white as well, as nature intended.</p>
<p>Except for the walking to the store part  &mdash;   Wal-Mart took care of that.  Now we&rsquo;re lucky to have a single store in every third county.</p>

<p>Soprano,<br>
Unfortunately given the behavior of several &#8220;Republican&#8221; stronzi lately, MLK would fit right in.</p>
<p>Quannell X was the one who was chased out of a White neighborhood somewhere in Texas a some months ago. He needed a police escort.</p>

		<p>When Reagan ran for his first time, I voted Republican. Richard Nixon abolished the draft, and for that I thought I was Republican. G Bush I seemed ok, so I voted republican. Clinton I hated, so I voted Republican out of disgust for the &#8216;other candidate&rsquo; in both 2000 and 2004&rsquo;s eclections.</p>
<p>But, seeing through Bush somehwere around 2005, I voted neither Republican nor Democrat in 2008. The Party that once defined a traditional (white, Europhilic, Christian) America is no more, even though the Tea Party events are overwhelmingly WHITE events; even though Ron Paul is still a Republican Congressman; even though I still think Sarah Palin is the best garlic against the Vampire of Bolshevik Obamaism. </p>
<p>Nowadays, the foolish utterances of Michael Steele- indeed, his very presence- has made me LOATHE the Republican Party. The fact that Lincoln and MLK were Republicans does not help- in fact, it merely proves that which many of my friends have yet to discover- both parties are the tools of the demise of America, and her White Majority.</p>
<p>And for this I should rejoice?</p>
