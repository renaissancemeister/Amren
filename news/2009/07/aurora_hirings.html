<h1><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_12868495">Aurora Hirings of Cops, Firefighters Probed on Race Issue</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Aurora has too few black and Latino police officers and firefighters, and city officials say a federal inquiry into the city&rsquo;s hiring practices may help them solve the problem.</p>
<p>In a letter notifying the city of a federal investigation to determine whether Aurora is engaged in a &#8220;pattern and practice&#8221; of discriminatory hiring, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice noted the percentages of Aurora&rsquo;s black and Latino firefighters &#8220;are significantly lower than would be expected for agencies of these types.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Having a more diverse public- safety team  &mdash;  police and fire departments  &mdash;  is a high priority for the city,&#8221; Miller [City Manager Ron Miller] said. &#8220;We look forward to working with the Department of Justice to identify additional strategies and opportunities to improve our hiring.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the Police Department&rsquo;s 626 sworn officers, 85.3 percent are white, 6.9 percent are Latino, 4.3 percent are black, 1.1 percent are Asian and 1.1 percent are American Indian.</p>
<p>Aurora&rsquo;s Fire Department employs 305 firefighters, 65 of whom are minorities. About 5 percent are Latino and 3 percent are black.</p>
<p>According to June figures provided by the Denver Civil Service Commission, 20.27 percent of Denver&rsquo;s sworn officers are Latino and 9.35 percent are black.</p>
<p>Denver&rsquo;s fire department is 19.8 percent Latino and 6.3 percent black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Oates [Police Chief Dan Oates] was hired in 2005, diversifying the police force was among his top priorities.</p>
<p>Oates has dispatched recruiters around the country seeking minorities for the force, visiting job fairs and military bases. Before budget cuts took them away, the city offered signing bonuses. The department now has classes to help people prepare for written and physical exams required for recruits.</p>
<p>These efforts have brought in many new minority hires, Oates said. On Friday, three of the nine graduates from the department&rsquo;s police academy were minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, the city hired Mike Garcia to be fire chief. His goal also is to diversify the department.</p>
<p>But the Fire Department has few openings every year  &mdash;  especially as retirements have fallen with the worsening economy. And not many minorities are in the pool of qualified candidates, Garcia said.</p>

		<p>We need to find out where all these liberal people live.Then take black men off the street and just give them these jobs.Let the affirmative action candidates service these liberal areas.Get the most diverse crew of minorites to  these areas.If there are white segregated areas give them the officers and firemen who passed the tests and are qualified.Lets see what the libs would say then!Like most people these liberal ideas are always a good idea for other people to live under .They need to reap the seeds they sowed in this country.</p>

		<p>Colorado is another state that is anticipating significant problems meeting their budget the fiscal year beginning July 1.  They will probably squeak by, but it&rsquo;s going to take some reductions in many departments, both state and local, as their revenue continues to fall substantially as further job losses occur.</p>
<p>Their braying right now about &#8220;diversity,&#8221; but they&rsquo;ll be singing a different tune toward the end of this year.</p>
<p>And, although this depression is one I&rsquo;d rather not have, I think it&rsquo;s just what we need to shut multicult mouths and to get their minds off saying things they believe will enhance their careers, because more likely than not many of them will be drawing unemployment before much longer.</p>
<p>When they do, I&rsquo;m hoping a non-white will be selected over them for every job they apply for.  That would be true justice.</p>

		<p> Were they giving prep classes for exams and signing bonuses to minorities only and to the exclusion of whites? Would this also constitute a violation of union contracts? How do they justify this? </p>

		<p>When I lived in Aurora, I applied for the police department.  I scored at the 97th percentile on the written test.  For &#8220;ethnicity&#8221;, I put &#8220;Asian&#8221; because I figured, since some of my ancestors certainly came from Asia (being Jewish and all) this would be truthful.  I was called in and questioned about this.  They told me that neither myself, nor Gypsies, could count themselves Asian.  Both groups are &#8220;white&#8221;, the man said.  When it came time for the interview, it was a black woman who did the interviewing and it was obvious, from the beginning, that she had no intention of considering me.  Like other police departments, they&rsquo;ll have to eliminate any meaningful standards if they want to have their precious &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>With the influx of minority applicants that are unqualified for the job, combined with the state budgetary cookie jars being empty, I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;d better start carrying $100 bills behind our driver&rsquo;s licenses again. The Comintern in this country seems hell-bent on hiring a Third World police force by gutting police officers&rsquo; pay and pensions. Next will come <i>la mordida,</i> as underpaid, unqualified, and dishonest cops decide to make ends meet by any means necessary, when Dear Leader&rsquo;s economic collapse occurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look for the first instance of a policeman who cannot speak English.&#8221; - Thomas Chittum, <i>Civil War II</i> </p>

		<p>Race-based hiring practices can be quickly summed up as <b>&#8220;white males need not apply&#8221;</b>! </p>
<p>Until white men wake up en masse to that fact, I&rsquo;m afraid this relentless conquest will continue to steamroll over every white male until we start taking back our sovereign rights as citizens of our respective countries. </p>
<p>Our Canadian white population has been drastically reduced to about 85% solely due to mass 3rd world immigration year after year, resulting in our police/firemen jobs being specifically reserved for recent arrivals by these traitorous &#8220;diversity promoters&#8221; as seen in <a href="https://www.immigrationwatchcanada.org/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=2247" rel="nofollow">this short article</a>.<br>

		<p>What a coincidence. Denver &#8216;doesn&rsquo;t have enough&rsquo; non-whites on the force either. Could it be because all the towns outside of Denver aggressively practice &#8216;equal opportunity&rsquo; also?</p>
<p>Funny thing is, cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Memphis and Philadelphia don&rsquo;t have diversity programs. Well, they do, and they are just as fervent. But by &#8216;diversity&rsquo; these places also mean programs and support for blacks. The very folks who are employed there at way, way above average census numbers. </p>
