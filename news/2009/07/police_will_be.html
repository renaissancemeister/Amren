			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Macer Hall, Daily Express (London), July 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>POLICE will be ordered not to charge Muslim extremists in many hate crime cases  &mdash;  to stop them becoming more militant.</p>
<p>Guidelines will tell forces to press for conviction only in cases of clear-cut criminal acts.</p>
<p>Officers will be advised not to proceed when evidence of lawbreaking is &#8220;borderline&#8221;.</p>
<p>Examples of crimes to which a blind eye may be turned include incitement to religious hatred or viewing extremist material on the internet.</p>
<p>Last night critics warned that the move could mean Islamic radicals being give the freedom to encourage violence.</p>
<p>Some saw the move as a politically correct attempt to appease extremists who hate Britain.</p>
<p>It could even mean officers tolerating many activities of Muslim preachers of hate like the hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza.</p>
<p>Tory MP David Davies said: &#8220;This sounds like abject surrender. Everyone should be equal in the eyes of the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether someone is suspected of incitement to hatred or shoplifting  &mdash;  they should all face the same risk of prosecution.</p>
<p>&#8220;There should be no special favours or treatment for any section of the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officials insist there is no suggestion that people who have clearly committed offences will avoid prosecution.</p>
<p>Instead, they want to avoid alienating Muslims on the fringes of extremism by dragging them to court over petty allegations unlikely to result in conviction.</p>
<p>One fear is that some young Muslims are falling under the influence of extremist preachers while serving prison sentences or on remand awaiting trial.</p>
<p>A senior Whitehall official said the guidance was being drawn up as part of a drive to use persuasion rather than the criminal justice system to fight extremism.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;The aim is to stop people being dragged into extremism.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not talking about letting someone off who has committed a clear offence, but where it is unclear if an offence has been committed.</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance, where there has been incitement or someone has been on the internet there can be a grey area where there is some discretion and it would be more sensible to avoid going down the criminal route.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Government&rsquo;s counter- terrorism board is drawing up the advice, which will be sent to all police forces, including the Metropolitan, later this year.</p>
<p>The move follows an updated Home Office counter-terrorism strategy announced earlier this year. The new strategy urges preventative measures to win round potential extremists instead of arrest and prosecution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to be able to provide support for individuals who are drawn into criminal activity,&#8221; the document says.</p>
<p>Councils, community groups and the Government&rsquo;s youth justice board will be among organisations expected to identify those drawn into extremism or at risk.</p>
<p>Social workers, teachers and other professionals will be asked to try to work with some Muslim youths to reduce the likelihood of them turning into extremists.</p>
<p>But the new strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of prosecutions against Islamist extremists protesting against troops.</p>
<p>In Luton earlier this year, protesters displayed placards bearing the words &#8220;butchers&#8221; and &#8220;animals&#8221; at a homecoming parade for 2nd Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment. There were no arrests for incitement.</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said: &#8220;Preventing people becoming radicalised is a key priority for the Government. The police response needs to be proportionate to deal with crimes people commit while reducing the risk to public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest move represents a reversal of the policy introduced under Tony Blair in the wake of the terrorist attacks in London in 2005, when as Prime Minister he called for an overhaul of the criminal justice system to root out and prosecute extremists.</p>
<p>Past attempts to win over potential Muslim radicals have frequently run into controversy. Millions of pounds have been pledged to fund Muslim groups, drawing claims that they are receiving special treatment.<br>

		<p>If we charge Muslim extremists with hate crimes, then that will drive them into a world of hate.  I have a great idea   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s do away with all criminal law, because enforcing criminal law against criminals only drives them into a life of crime.  Not only that, they would have rap sheets.</p>

<p>Most of these &#8220;professionals&#8221; will be bleeding heart do gooders with no idea whatsoever of what the muslim agenda IS. No matter what the Brits or we in the U.S. do to appease the muslims, they WILL NOT BE SATISFIED until they are in control and there are no more non muslims. We may have to invent words (ethnicity comes to mind) to encompass more words for surrender. Mustn&rsquo;t outrage the muslims and, as usual, Weapons are our friends.</p>

<p>Which any fool with half a brain knows it will only serve to make them bolder and even worse.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example of one of my contentions:  Whites will get no respect from cowardly elitists until they get up off the couch and take their destinies in their own hands.</p>
<p>Right now they expect us to take any degradations they dish out, and they&rsquo;re right.  The only problem for them is that there IS a growing rage among several million people in the West, and if they are forced out of their comfortable lifestyles the world will shake with thunder.  And these same elitists will be on everybody&rsquo;s payback list.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be in their shoes.  <br>

		<p>Weakness,  weakness ad infinitum. <br>
Criminal elements will simply take advantage of being declared a &#8221; protected species&#8221;.  Good luck to you all&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.you&rsquo;re going to need it.<br>
Imagine declaring a race being above the law beacause that&rsquo;s basically what it boils down to. You socialists are going to have to answer for all this sooner or later.</p>

		<p>Maybe the British bobbies should look at how the Chinese police deal with rampaging Muslims. British bobbies are as useless as bazooms on a bull. I would rather rely on a gun for my protection, than any police officer.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that it is illegal in Great Britain to view &#8220;extremist material&#8221; on the internet.  Big Brother has won.</p>
<p><i>The move follows an updated Home Office counter-terrorism strategy announced earlier this year. The new strategy urges preventative measures to win round potential extremists instead of arrest and prosecution.</i></p>
<p>Such tolerance will never be shown to the BNP of course.  That is because, despite all their whining about how the BNP are dangerous facists, the powers that be know in reality that they are law abiding, nonviolent people.  By contrast, the powers that be are genuinely frightened by the radical Muslims.  They know they mean business.  Hence the appeasement.</p>

		<p>I left the UK nearly 6 years ago after living in London for a while.</p>
<p>In that time we experienced a white child stabbed about 300 yards from our house. The criminal ran into a mosque and the police would not go in after him - for fear of causing offence. The police arrested the childs father when he tried to go in after his sons attacker.The people at the mosque then were able to spirit him out of the country. </p>
<p>My wife was stoned by a gang of muslims on the way home from work; we were also attacked by a gang outside the vets surgery when we took our sick dog in. </p>
<p>Immediately after the 7/7 bombings my neighbour, as much a Leftie as you can get, was walking home (all transport had been stopped) and he, along with thousands more office workers, had to run a gauntlet of jeering muslims lining the streets of Wapping and Limehouse. No police action.</p>
<p>He now votes BNP.</p>
<p>Muslim gamgs frequently &#8220;mobbed&#8221; white women and sexually assaulted them in the streets, they also had a &#8220;game&#8221; of running up behind white males and stabbing them in the buttocks/legs. </p>
<p>The police stood by.</p>
<p>After several years of increasing violence and intimidation the locals began to complain to the local authority, the police and Members of Parliament.</p>
<p>The typical reaction was to brand US racist.</p>
<p>They did nothing.</p>
<p>The UK is a lost cause.</p>
<p>Where I live now I have the right to bear arms (which I exercise) and to self defence. My neighbours nearly all have weapons for hunting, target shooting and self defence. The police are armed, unafraid and delightfully &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are no muslims outside of the slums near major cities and crime is virtually non-existant.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I live in France.</p>
<p>I will NOT be going back to the UK.</p>

		<p>These idiots will never learn, as long as there are Muslims in your country there is trouble. This concept of the moderate muslim is a myth. Even if a muslim does not plant bombs in your street and seems to live a civilised life, he will still hate you because you are a Kafir or non believer. <br>

		<p>&ldquo;borderline&rdquo; That means inciting to violent and hateful acts against Christians and Jews.<br>
One wonders if they will prosecute the stonings, beatings, arson, and beheadings that will follow the lenient treatment.<br>

		<p>As we all know, London will be hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics. I fear for the foreign visitors who&rsquo;ll be coming into London; putting their lives in the hands of the British bobbies. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me one iota, if there was a terrorist attack at the Games.</p>
<p>The British will do absolutely nothing about Muslims wiping their feet on them; but Nick Griffin running a slate of BNP candidates for Parliament is labeled an extremist.</p>
