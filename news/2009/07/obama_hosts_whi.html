<h1><a href="https://news.aol.com/article/gates-and-crowley-meet-at-white-house/595506">Obama Hosts White Cop, Black Scholar</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Feller, AP, July 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With mugs of beer and calming words, President Barack Obama and the professor and policeman engulfed in a national uproar over race pledged Thursday to move on and try to pull country with them.</p>
<p>There was no acrimony  &mdash;  nor apology  &mdash;  from any of the three: black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., white Cambridge, Mass., police Sgt. James Crowley who had arrested him for disorderly conduct, and Obama who declared on national TV that the police had &#8220;acted stupidly.&#8221; But neither Gates nor Crowley backtracked either, agreeing they still had differences.</p>
<p>Said Obama after the highly anticipated, 40-minute chat at a picnic table on the White House South Lawn: &#8220;I have always believed that what brings us together is stronger than what pulls us apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am confident that has happened here tonight, and I am hopeful that all of us are able to draw this positive lesson from this episode,&#8221; said the nation&rsquo;s first black president.</p>
<p>Under the canopy of a magnolia tree in the early evening, Obama joined the other players in a story that had knocked the White House off stride. Vice President Joe Biden joined them for drinks and snacks.</p>
<p>The policeman and the professor both expressed respect for each other after their dispute had unleashed a furor over racial profiling in America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s meeting did not include Lucia Whalen, the woman who called 911 to report the potential break-in. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We agreed to move forward,&#8221; Crowley said Thursday night when asked if anything was solved in the meeting. &#8220;I think what you had today was two gentlemen agreeing to disagree on a particular issue. I don&rsquo;t think that we spent too much time dwelling on the past. We spent a lot of time discussing the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>For his part, Gates said he and Crowley had been caught up as characters in a much larger narrative about race over which they had no control.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is incumbent upon Sgt. Crowley and me to utilize the great opportunity that fate has given us,&#8221; Gates said in a statement. He said their task must be to foster sympathy among Americans about &#8220;the daily perils of policing on the one hand, and for the genuine fears of racial profiling on the other hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, meanwhile, a black sergeant who was with Crowley at Gates&rsquo; home said he&rsquo;s been maligned as an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; for supporting the actions of his white colleague, according to an e-mail that CNN said it received from the sergeant.</p>
<p>The officer, Leon Lashley, said he &#8220;spoke the truth&#8221; about the arrest, and he said Gates should consider whether he &#8220;may have caused grave and potentially irreparable harm to the struggle for racial harmony.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Actually, I think the Gates case woke up quite a few sleeping whites.  A saw a lot of rage directed at Gates, and a lot of disgust directed at blacks who rallied around him, as they always do regardless of how much guilt is on the black side.  The fact of the matter is we will never get along completely.  Yes, we have a few on both sides that feed off the other or make money off the other but we have nothing in common.  And, you just don&rsquo;t get along with folks you have nothing in common with.  So, the country will let this pass and we&rsquo;ll all go on pretending, for the time being, to get along with each other until the next incident.</p>
<p>I thought Sgt. Lashley would eventually pay for his honesty and his loyalty.  They always do.  <br>

		<p>Am I about the only one who is completely fed-up with hearing about this whole entire incident? An incident which was not at all race related and a relatively minor occurance which never warranted nation-wide publicity in the first place. But I guess the left-wing national news media can&rsquo;t resist any story, no matter how unsubstantiated, involving allegations of evil white racism to trot out in front of the public. Whether it was the &#8220;Jena 6&#8221; affair or this incident, the liberal media can not resist the opportunity to fan the flames of racial animosity. The public should demand better from their cable news channels and newspapers by threatening to change channels or cancel their newspaper subsciptions unless/until they stop exploiting these disgusting racial hoaxes. </p>

<p>  &mdash;  In the same way that Blacks denigrate those of their own color who stand up in any way or agree in any way with Whites - that&rsquo;s the way Whites have to react to other Whites who are multiculturalists or liberals who support the agenda of other races and the displacement of Whites.  They must begin to understand that this is not about justice; it&rsquo;s about power and command.  We still have much power and wealth in this country and the Blacks and non-Whites who habitate here and are invading us through both legal and illegal immigration want it.  With the attainment of that power they want to destroy us.</p>

		<p>The cop didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong!  Of course he shouldn&rsquo;t say &#8216;sorry&#8221;.  This had nothing to do with race&hellip;nothing&hellip;except that Gates and Obama made it racial.  But both men are so small, so shallow that neither can conceive of appologizing to a white man.  </p>

<p>Obama attempts to recover by playing to his strengths.  He makes grand, sweeping statements about a confidential conversation that was artificially staged for damage control.  Since none of us were there to hear what was said, he can preach all he likes about bringing people together, etc.  That&rsquo;s right Obama, go back to your platitudes  &mdash;  we&rsquo;ve seen what happens when you actually make a concrete statement.  </p>

The confrontation between Crowley and Gates amounts to &#8220;he said, he said&#8221;. Since they were the only two present for the majority of conflict, we can only go by what Crowley wrote in his report and what Gates said in his few interviews with a select group of supporters (such as the journal The Root   <a href="https://www.theroot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theroot.com</a> ).</p>
<p>People are dismissing Crowleys&rsquo; version because of something called &#8216;the good cop syndrome&rsquo;; the alleged tendency to believe the perceived good and honest cop verses the &#8216;criminal&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Gates has said he wasn&rsquo;t yelling because he couldn&rsquo;t because he had a throat infection. However, we can see from the photo that it appears that he was yelling.</p>
<p>We also know that the black cop said he heard Gates essentially mouthing off though he gives no specific details as to what Gates said.</p>
<p>At least for me, Gates has yet to come out in an open forum and flatly refute the allegations. So far, his denials have come through, as I said, supportive outlets. At this point, it appears to me he doesn&rsquo;t want to say anything that he may be called on later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said there are three sides to every argument. There&rsquo;s your side, there&rsquo;s my side, and there&rsquo;s the truth. At this point, unless either one admits to exaggerating or lying, I don&rsquo;t know how we can arrive at the truth.</p>
<p>What I find fascinating is the 911 call by Lucia Whalen. In the call, she is extremely reticent to give a racial description and it sounds like she&rsquo;s tearing herself apart when she says the suspect might be hispanic. In the press conference, she&rsquo;s terrified that anyone might for a second believe she&rsquo;s a racist.</p>
<p>This woman is terrified of both the truth and her own perceptions.</p>

		<p>The only reason Obama invited Crowley to the White House is because Obama&rsquo;s comments about &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221; where so indefensible and were so patently biased that he had to respond with damage control.  </p>
<p>Prof. Gates also was in damage control since the 911 tapes showed conclusively that race was never mentioned and so when Crowley responded, he was clearly responding to a call in which race played no part.  The black police officer also confirmed that Gates was acting strangely.  So with Gates and Obama having no where to turn, they decide to have a beer and call it quits.   </p>

<p>No.  The reality is, Gates injected race into what should have been a nonevent.   Gates was in complete control as the officer  gave him several warnings about calming down and to stop shouting.  Gates also aggravated the situation with &#8220;yo mamma&#8221; wisecracks and &#8220;you better not mess with me&#8221; threats.  Gates was practically begging for an arrest.  </p>

		<p>   The case of Lucia Whalen is interesting, and overlooked.  She was on TV on the defensive, &#8220;I am not a racist.&#8221;  She did NOT identify the possible burglers as Blacks.  She thought one was Hispanic.  People were denouncing her as a racist.  She was no such thing.  How horrible!<br>
   Well, Ms. Whalen is probably a racist after all.  I have no idea what Gates&rsquo;s chauffeur looks like.  It is possible he is Black.  So is Gates.  Whalen saw the two trying to jimmy the door of Gates&rsquo;s home.  It was dark.  She did not see them well.  But it IS interesting that she identified neither as Black.  Was she being a racist in her identification?  Her failure, or rather her REFUSAL to identify Blacks as Blacks - is that not also racism.  <br>
   Whalen should be commended for trying to alert police of a possible crime.  However, if she purposely misidentified the possible perpetrators, simply out of fear of fingering Blacks, then she is indeed a racist.  &mdash;    &mdash;  -Hugh Murray </p>

<p><br>
Unfortunately, this never solves anything.  Ever.  But this effects ever social aspect of life, from a Couple, to a Family, a Society, a Culture, a Race, etc. you get the idea.  It even effects an Individual in their personal life.  <br>
I may be wrong about the term but I think psychologists call this &#8220;confluence&#8221;, or, agreeing to disagree. <br>
All it does is put the problem off until a later date.  By which time of course it is building and building and simmering and simmering and -  Ka Boom!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see. </p>
<p>One possibly very positive thing to come from this is that the black officers have not backed down either, in their defense of their co-worker.  You see?  Not everyone is on the Multi Culti Hate The White Man No Matter What page.<br>
For me, it&rsquo;s clear that the whole phoney and twisted PC Narrative is unraveling, falling apart.<br>
Crowely clearly walked away, not so much the &#8220;winner&#8221;, but simply - a man.  A real adult.  Whereas the behavior of Obama and Gates was cheesy and sortid. </p>

		<p>To be honest, many of us Whites would have been critical of White police officer ho defended a Black cop over a White person or any other situation. Thus, I can understand why a number of Blacks are upset with Mr.Lashley. Thy are only showing thier rcil solidarity and pride. </p>

		<p>The fact is that the cop was a racist bully! Professor Gates is 5&rsquo;6, 150 lbs soaked with water and walks with a cane. The cop looked to be almost 6&rsquo;0, if not taller, about 225 lbs, well built and in good shape. It was clear that the cop used his physical prowess over professor Gates in an effort to humiliate him.</p>

		<p>I suggest that racial profiling has been shown to be unusable and socially disruptive for explaining black policing problems. If two highly sophisticated black men mistook competent policing for racial profiling then ordinary black people will often be mistaken as well. Look at all the fuss that has resulted. It&rsquo;s time to remove the concept of racial profiling from the list of possible causes of black policing problems. </p>

		<p>It is true that if two rational people have a dispute, usually all it takes is sitting down and talking it out. However, if one person is completely irrational, or three in this example, the equation doesn&rsquo;t work. All that was accomplished here was a publicity stunt paid for by Jane and Joe Taxpayer. </p>

<p>Being as Dr. Gates hurled numerous insults at Sgt. Crowley, including the oh-so-intellectual &#8220;Yo&rsquo; Mama,&#8221; I&rsquo;m glad that Crowley used his 6 inches and 75 pounds on Gates to humiliate him.  Cops might be a lot of things, but I&rsquo;m certainly not going to insult a man with a badge and gun to his face.  I&rsquo;m not proud of everything I&rsquo;ve done, but I do like living, and want to stay that way.</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity:</p>
<p>First off, I&rsquo;m a police officer. The badge and handgun are simply implements of my office. Never allow their presence to curb your right to speak. The only people who should ever feel intimidated are the predators who mean you harm. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dealt with several black people who&rsquo;ve reacted in the same manner as Professor Gates. When a simple &#8220;Here&rsquo;s my license officer&#8221; would prevent so much hostility and discord, they opt instead for the I&rsquo;m-gonna-mess-with-the-white-cop play. </p>
<p>Blacks are quite wily in their dealings with the police. They know that as long as they keep their hands to themselves, there&rsquo;s pretty much nothing they can&rsquo;t get away with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pretty big guy, and I&rsquo;m well trained. However, despite what treatment you may have received from other police, the last thing I&rsquo;d ever do is let my hands do the talking just because a citizen mouths off. A professional uses directed violence, for a lawful purpose - there should never be any such thing as &#8220;wall-to-wall counseling&#8221; just because a citizen talks tough.  </p>
<p>I too may have arrested Professor Gates, but not because he ran his mouth. That&rsquo;s a citizen&rsquo;s right (provided they don&rsquo;t voice a believable threat of impending assault). However, as an experienced cop, what homeowner in their right mind wouldn&rsquo;t start handing over a driver&rsquo;s license, a phone bill, a cable TV bill? What homeowner prolongs things with odd and unnecessary hostility?</p>
<p>Does Gates think the average officer has never locked himself out of his house? It&rsquo;s a common experience, one easily explained. Getting mouthy doesn&rsquo;t offend me so much as it makes me even more suspicious. </p>

		<p>In a CNN report, Lucia Whalen says:</p>
<p>&#8220;Cambridge is a wonderful place, and when I was called racist and I was a target of scorn and of ridicule because of the things I never said, the criticism hurt me as a person, but it also hurt the community of Cambridge,&#8221; she said, close to tears.</p>
<p>She only called 9-1-1 because another person who didn&rsquo;t have a cell phone observed what appeared to be a break-in and asked her to call. According to the report, Ms. Whalen was born in the United States to Portuguese parents. She appears to have moderately dark skin in her picture.</p>
<p>In another report, Ms. Whalen said she saw only the backs of the persons she reported. The storm of criticism which has struck this innocent passerby, who was only trying to do her duty as a citizen, doesn&rsquo;t reflect well on the media.<br>

<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>It seems gates was the one who tried to intimidate Officer Crowley.  Here is a portion of the police report  &mdash;  the police report that was removed from the Boston Globe website and that the Cambridge Police Department refused to release.  Why do you suppose that is?</p>
<p>Here are a few salient points about gate&rsquo;s behavior:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; As I stood in plain view of this man, later identified as Gates, I asked if he would step out onto the porch and speak with me. He replied &#8216;no I will not.&rsquo; He then demanded to know who I was. I told him that I was &#8216;Sgt. Crowley from the Cambridge Police&hellip;. While I was making this statement, Gates opened the front door and exclaimed &#8216;why, because I&rsquo;m a black man in America?&rsquo;&hellip;. yelling, he told me that it was none of my business and accused me of being a racist police officer. .. Gates then turned to me and told me that I had no idea who I was &#8216;messing&rsquo; with and that I had not heard the last of it.</p>
<p>Gates began to yell over my spoken words by accusing me of being a racist police officer and leveling threats that he wasn&rsquo;t someone to mess with.</p>
<p>My reason for wanting to leave the residence was that Gates was yelling very loud&hellip; His reply was &#8216;ya, I&rsquo;ll speak with your mama outside.&rsquo;  As I descended the stairs to the sidewalk, Gates continued to yell at me, accusing me of racial bias and continued to tell me that I had not heard the last of him&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/m7azl7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/m7azl7</a></p>
<p>BTW:  gates later lied and said that he had a bronchial infection and didn&rsquo;t and couldn&rsquo;t raise his voice</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s clear from the police report that Officer Crowley used his size to intimidate gates who was only trying his hardest to politely cooperate with a racist police officer, right?</p>
<p>Why did gates suddenly decide not to sue Officer Crowley after all and retract his demand for an apology from Officer Crowley for the &#8216;lies&rsquo; gates claimed Crowley wrote in the police report?</p>
<p>Lawrence Auster is correct when he writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I suggest that when a White police officer sees someone breaking into a black-owned home or black-owned store, he think once, think twice, and then walk on down the road&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>The whole thing is stupid beyond reasonable belief! A report of an apparent break-in. Police responding, questioning the person answering their knocks (Gates). Gates apparently getting mouthy with the officer. Refusing to cooperate and show sufficient I.D.</p>
<p>Reverse the scene with the responding officers refusing to check out the apparent crime; the media circus would have it appear the police refused to check out the apparent crime&hellip; simply because the residence was inhabited by a Black man (Gates). Go figure!</p>

		<p>Another glaring example of intimidation by the Obama Thugs from Chicago. As the nation&rsquo;s chief law enforcement officer, Obamalama surely FORCED Crowley to come to this ridiculous photo op. </p>
<p>Here are more examples from the Chi-town hustlers: </p>
<p>Thanks to Michelle Malkin&rsquo;s article posted on VDARE</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/malkin/090728_bully_boys.htm</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask the Congressional Budget Office. Last week, President Obama spilled the beans on the &#8220;Today Show&#8221; that he had met with CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf &mdash; just as the number crunchers were casting ruinous doubt on White House cost-saving claims. Yes, question the timing. </p>
<p>The CBO is supposed to be a neutral scorekeeper &mdash; not a water boy for the White House. But when the meeting failed to stop the CBO from issuing more analysis undercutting the health care savings claims, Obama&rsquo;s budget director Peter Orszag played the heavy.</p>
<p>Orszag warned the CBO in a public letter that it risked feeding the perception that it was &#8220;exaggerating costs and underestimating savings.&#8221; Message: Leave the number fudging to the boss. Capiche?</p>
<p>Obama issued an even more explicit order to unleash the hounds on Blue Dog Democrats during his health care press conference. &#8220;Keep up the heat&#8221; translated into Organizing for America/Democratic National Committee attack ads on moderate Democrats who have revolted against Obamacare&rsquo;s high costs and expansive government powers over medical decisions.</p>
<p>Looks like there won&rsquo;t be a health care beer summit anytime soon.</p>
<p>The CBO and the Blue Dogs got off easy compared to inspectors general targeted by Team Obama goons. Former AmeriCorps inspector general Gerald Walpin was slimed as mentally incompetent (&#8220;confused&#8221; and &#8220;disoriented&#8221;) after blowing the whistle on several cases of community service tax fraud, including the case of Obama crony Kevin Johnson. Johnson is the NBA star turned Sacramento mayor who ran a federally funded nonprofit group employing AmeriCorps volunteers, who were exploited to perform campaign work for Johnson and to provide personal services (car washes, errands) to Johnson and his staff.</p>
<p>Walpin filed suit last week to get his job back &mdash; and to defend the integrity and independence of inspectors general system-wide. But he faces hardball tactics from both the West Wing and the East Wing, where first lady Michelle Obama has been intimately involved in personnel decisions at AmeriCorps, according to youth service program insiders.</p>
<p>At the Environmental Protection Agency, top Obama officials muzzled veteran researcher Alan Carlin, who dared to question the conventional wisdom on global warming. The economist with a physics degree was trashed as a non-scientist know-nothing.</p>
<p>Obama Treasury officials forced banks to take TARP bailout money they didn&rsquo;t want and obstructed banks that wanted to pay back TARP money from doing so. The administration strong-armed Chrysler creditors and Chrysler dealers using politicized tactics that united both House Democrats and Republicans, who passed an amendment last week reversing Obama on the closure of nearly 800 Chrysler dealerships and more than 2,000 GM dealerships.</p>
<p>At the Justice Department, Obama lawyers are now blocking a House inquiry into the suspicious decision to dismiss default judgments against radical New Black Panther Party activists who intimidated voters and poll workers on Election Day in Philadelphia. The DOJ is preventing Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., from meeting with the trial team in the case. Wolf has been pressing for answers on what communications Attorney General Eric Holder and his deputies conducted with third-party interest groups and other political appointees about the case. So far: radio silence&#8221;</p>
<p>The only honest gesture I saw on the video of the beer party in the garden, was bumbling boob Biden sucking down the beer.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly care for cops OR blacks, so I can&rsquo;t take anybody&rsquo;s side on this one. If you ask me, the police and the African &#8220;community&#8221; in the United States deserve each other,  but I usually end up siding with the cops against the blacks because the blacks are almost always at fault. In this case, Gates is a pampered Ivy League affirmative-action black with a childish and unjustified chip on his shoulder  &mdash;  the same old story  &mdash;  but what did he do to deserve getting arrested? Yell at a cop?</p>
<p>Since when is it a crime to yell at a cop? Since when do we owe cops instant and total obedience? You don&rsquo;t have to do everything they say, you know. You don&rsquo;t even have to talk to them or answer their questions beyond showing them ID in some cases. Furthermore, who gave the cops the authority to kidnap us at force  &mdash;  using Tazers if necessary to enforce &#8220;compliance&#8221;  &mdash;  and hold us for ransom just because they don&rsquo;t like our &#8220;attitude?&#8221; Gates didn&rsquo;t commit any crimes, He didn&rsquo;t rob or rape anybody. All he did was scream like a baby at a cop, who then proceeded to abuse his authority to get even. I can&rsquo;t support either of them.</p>
<p>Gates behaved like a spoiled brat, but free people don&rsquo;t worship law enforcement. Never forget that these same cops will be enforcing hate speech laws against the likes of us in a couple years. </p>

		<p>It is quite obvious to anyone with any investigatory experience that Gates staged the whole incident.</p>
<p>Having said that, it means that everyone from journalists to police through to independant observers have been complicit in this scam through their silence.</p>
<p>Does anyone remember when the story broke that the call was about two &#8220;young&#8221; men who were trying to break the door down and when gates was later questioned about this he claimed he had enlisted their help after he&rsquo;d locked themselves out. They&rsquo;ve never been questioned or identified and this section of the story has been long forgotten.</p>
<p>*Scenario* Gates gets two swarthy young men to act suspiciously in his well-to-do neighborhood and overtly break into his house, Gates then waits for police to arrive ensuring he&rsquo;s the only one on the scene when police arrive. Gates then deliberately escalates the situation as he was planning to do all along. JOB DONE.</p>
<p>Has anyone even attempted to identify and question Gates&rsquo; accomplices? If not, why not?</p>

<p>Read my post (#16) above. Not every cop is the draconian, medieval thug you may believe them to be. Are there belligerent, bullying cops out there? Absolutely. Are there needlessly combative citizens out there? Absolutely. </p>
<p>As for your prediction that cops in the future will enforce as-yet unwritten hate speech laws, you&rsquo;re wide of the mark. Absent from your prediction is the preceding necessity for average citizens like yourself to even allow their elected officials to first discuss, then enact, those imaginary free-speech restrictions. A citizen&rsquo;s voice tends to be loudest at the ballot box.</p>
<p>As for talking to police, I say again, read my post above. You&rsquo;re correct in stating that citizens have broad rights when it comes to expressing themselves to a police officer. However, most Americans can name every contestant on Dancing With the Stars but no more than two or three of the Constitutional Rights guaranteed them by the Bill of Rights. If a citizen doesn&rsquo;t know their own rights, whose fault is that?</p>
<p>Instant and total obedience to police officers? I can only say that a professional cop will never impose upon a private citizen without lawful reason to do so. When that happens, deciding to ignore an officer&rsquo;s lawful authority is a risky decision only you will end up answering for.</p>
<p>As for worshipping law enforcement? That&rsquo;s preposterous: in reality, most people can&rsquo;t stand the police&hellip;until they need one. </p>

&#8220;Am I about the only one who is completely fed-up with hearing about this whole entire incident? An incident which was not at all race related and a relatively minor occurance which never warranted nation-wide publicity in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Count me in too.  This actually took some time away from talking about Jacko for a while at least.<br>
 However, a much more tragic death (kidnapped, beaten and throat slashed), that of 17 year old Lilly Burk (RIP)at the hands of another in again out again Black predator while she was on an errand for her MOM received one mention on Fox.News( Thank you Martha Mc Callum) and none from anyone else. Lilly was just another victim of The Dirty War being waged against White people. <br>
Blacks love it when things like the Gates case get so much coverage because attention is focused away from the horrors that are going on all over the US almost every day.<br>
I contend that if Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman had been murdered by an unknown with a name Hakim Shamir Thompson  of South Central LA we would never have heard of it. The only reason that we did was because of OJ&rsquo;s celebrity (in the eyes of some fools at least). </p>

There are many issues here.</p>
<p>One is that every time a police officer responds to a call, he has to fully assess the situation.</p>
<p>Crowley was doing his job by responding to a 911 call where it was reported that TWO men were seen forcing their way into a house.</p>
<p>When he arrived, he only found one. Where was the other guy? If Crowley didn&rsquo;t see the second man, what assumptions should he have made? Was the second man hiding? Was the second man a threat? Should the police officer let down his guard simply because one man says &#8216;this is my house&rsquo;? The officer needs to see proof AND assess every aspect of the situation.</p>
<p>Even if it was Gates&rsquo; house, the officer needs to determine why the owner was seen breaking in. Did he simply lock himself out? Or was he locked out?</p>
<p>While Gates may have been the resident of the home, there&rsquo;s no way for the cop to immediately determine the full circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, Gates may have been involved in a domestic dispute with his wife and had a restraining order against him. If so, the wife would have likely been told to change the locks.</p>
<p>When Crowley arrived, he had no way of knowing exactly what was going on. Gates could have been locked out of his house by his wife after a domestic complaint. Even if he presented proof he lived there, that doesn&rsquo;t prove that he wasn&rsquo;t a threat to his wife who may have filed a complaint against him.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say Gates simply gave Crowley his license and Crowley accepted the story that it was his home. Crowley leave. Gates (and his accomplice) then waits for his wife and attacks her. She&rsquo;s hurt or killed.</p>
<p>The next step would be to blame Crowley for not following proper procedures in questioning of Gates and why he simply took Gates&rsquo; word that he was a resident of the home. The feminists and victims advocates would have demanded Crowley be fired for his sloppy and incompetent police work. There would be demands that the entire police force needs to be retained to be senstive and aware of domestic issues.</p>
<p>The police have to make these kinds of on-the-spot, life-and-death decisions all the time. They have to ask lots of questions. </p>
<p>Since it appeared that a crime was being committed and a 911 call was made, it is a police officers duty to find out all the facts. Simply presenting a license or proof of residency does not mean that Gates wasn&rsquo;t a threat to other residence of the home.</p>

<p>You are probably correct. I think that are a number of White men who will not hesitate to use their physical strength to humiliate or intimidate Black men who are smaller than they are.</p>
<p>I am a Black man who is 5&rsquo;5, 140lbs. From 1994 to 1996, I worked at an advertising firm in Nevada. I was easily the shortest man there. I was also the only Black person as well. There were previously three of us, but the two other women left. One to start her own consulting firm and the other moved to the northeast.  </p>
<p>Frequently during my tenure there, a number of the guys would stand over top of me,look directly down at me in my face and speak to me as if I was a child. Others would make comments like &#8220;how is it donw there&#8221; &#8220;you are really down to earth&#8221; and <br>
&#8220;Napoleon was a short guy, wasn&rsquo;t he Eddie?&#8221; and other obnoxious comments. </p>
<p>A couple of times, one guy who was at least 6,1 and 235 lbs came up from behind me, picked me up and moved me aside and kept on walking. Another time I had just came back from lunch and I had a tape that someone left in my mailbox. The measage on the casette said &#8220;play this tape.&#8221; On the tape was the song &#8220;Short people have no reason to live.&#8221; I was so angry. </p>
<p>After a few months, I complained to magagement about the behavior of certain co-workers. They promised to have a talk with these individuals. Afterwards, things did get better, but some of the psychological behavior continued.  overtime such behavior had taken is toll and I requested a transfer. I continued to work in advertising for another three years and afterwards I decided to make a career change. I am now an independent consultant and a parttime adjunct college professor.</p>
<p>I have spoken with a number of short Black men like myself who have talked about enduring degrading and humiliating situations with police officers, in bars, in college dormitories with jocks etc&hellip; </p>
<p>Even on this board from time to time I have seen examples from short Black men who have recited stories of humliation and physical and psychological abuse from larger White guys.   </p>
<p>My point is that such behavior does indeed take place.</p>

The released tpaes made it clear that Gates did not say &#8221; I will speak with your mama outside.&#8221; This was false.</p>

<p>If anything, your words in this thread make me glad even more that I have a cautious attitude when it comes to cops.  Until recently, the city of St. Louis had something called a Citizens Academy, and it was an 8-week long two night a week mini-academy about the realities of cop work and law enforcement.  One of the nights later on in the process, they let us take a couple of rounds in the firearms simulator, where you pretend to be a real cop with a quasi-real gun, and the screen ahead of you has a recording of a real situation that you can make decisions in.  It was a real eye opener, too; I made three mistakes that would have costed a real cop his job.  It&rsquo;s easy to bash cops when you don&rsquo;t walk in their impossible shoes.  It was at that point I figured out that I should make life for a cop as easy as possible and as non-threatening as possible.  Disclaimer:  I have not yet been stopped, pulled over or accosted by an LEO (i.e. as a suspect or person of interest) in my 32 years of life.  I did have one ask me, looked to be a rookie, ask me for street directions in the neighborhood where I lived, but that&rsquo;s it.  </p>

		<p>I avoid cops and courtrooms.  Both are skewed way out of any advantage for me as a regular citizen.  When I have to deal with a cop I show only respect, same as I did in the military.  Even as a White man I know that if I mouth off to a cop I am likely to be arrested on some kind of charge real or trumped.  I don&rsquo;t pick fights I know I can&rsquo;t win.<br>

		<p>re: Eddie- It was because you were short, not Black that some of these people did that and this has nothing to do with Whites/Blacks. These same co-workers would have done it to a White man and there are big Black men who do the same to small White men. I agree that such behavior, hassling someone over their height is wrong. Your former co-workers sound like children.</p>

<p>&gt; Eddie wrote about being bullied as a short Black.  I wish submit to him that it was more about being short than Black.  Even in his own story, nothing came up about being teased for being Black, just short. His bullying co-workers were right about one thing; Napoleon was very short.  But he sure dominated a lot of tall men, didn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>I have had to fight against being discriminated or just not taken seriously as a short person all my life.  I fought it by turning the tables on the bullies in my early life and conquering through academics and mastering sports in which being short did not matter.  I have a room full of awards for motorcycle racing, fencing, and even horse jumping.  I also have a post grad degree, public speaking awards and a very large personal library full of history, literature and science books.  I don&rsquo;t let anyone bully me on any level, even on the subtle plain - I notice everything.  Which is one reason that I have to respond as a White man to the attacks on White people world wide since it is overwhelmingly obvious that it is all aimed at the genocide of my race.</p>
<p>But the point is that I recognized early on that as a short person, I had to work harder and be fiercer.  I think that this has been helpful to me in my life.  I also think that I can see clearly that if I had just thrown up my hands and whined about being a short person, I would have suffered much more than I did.  I never let it get to me, I just worked to equalize the equation.  You are making a very good illustration of the idea that claiming victimhood of any kind easily becomes a bad habit and does more harm to the claimant than the actual acts of discrimination, because it invites more as it excuses the claimant of any need to work harder to overcome it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Professior&#8221; Gates is a perfect example of this problem.  There he is - a professor at an Ivy League college.  All the Affirmative Action doors and special funds opened wide for him so that he could strut about on the campus as an expert.  But what does he teach?, Black History.  That is to say he teaches justification for victimhood as a career.  People like that attact proof of their oppression because they ask for it - the way he did when he over-reacted because a White cop wanted him to prove that he had broken into his own home.  Personally, I&rsquo;d be glad that my neighbors were watching the area that well.  Also, I have had a couple experiences with White policemen who were unfair and a bit nasty to me for no reason, except for their assumptions (I was in a red car one time!).  But my response wasn&rsquo;t to call them a pig or fascist or something that a White anarchist might.  No, I took it and moved on.  Life is easier that way, it wasn&rsquo;t that big a deal - but it could have been.  I&rsquo;ve known a few cops and they have to deal with aggressive idiots all the time.  It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to be a little humble when they obviously irritable - that is unless you have a big chip on your shoulder, like your self-view as a victim.  All I can say is what a way to live!</p>
<p>The song &#8220;Short People&#8221; by the way, is a song by Randy Newman.  He wrote it to satirize the bigoted mind.  A clever response by Eddie would have been to play the Newman song &#8220;Rednecks&#8221; at his own desk, loud enough for them to hear. I bet they would have laughed and slapped him on the back - and left him alone after that.</p>
<p>Of course if you really learn history, then you will know that the Rednecks were coal miners who fought for a Union in the early 20th century and got shot and harassed for it by bully boys hired by the Capitalist bosses.  They were called Rednecks because of the red bandanas they all wore around their necks.  The Rednecks fought back with firearms themselves until the government sent in the U.S. Army.   Since many of them had just finished serving in that army during WW1, they folded.  Yeah, Rednecks - those commies who tried to get ridiculous rights for coal miners in Appalachia.  Funny how identifications and ideas get twisted around over time, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>Nobody has yet explained why Skip has such a chip on his shoulder.  He&rsquo;s been given everything in this country.  He&rsquo;s had opportunities given to him that no African-African could ever dream of.  Maybe his deep seated, seething rage is the result of his having been racially profiled by Harvard University when they, due to his physical characterists, allowed him to enter the University despite falling short of the minimum requirements expected of all othe racial groups.  It seems that racial profiling, whether it&rsquo;s fake (as in the incident with Officer Crowley) or beneficial (as in the form of racial profiling we know as affirmative action) to the black person, always results in underlying rage.</p>

<p>What I find fascinating is the 911 call by Lucia Whalen. In the call, she is extremely reticent to give a racial description and it sounds like she&rsquo;s tearing herself apart when she says the suspect might be hispanic. In the press conference, she&rsquo;s terrified that anyone might for a second believe she&rsquo;s a racist.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  </p>
<p>I wonder what she would have done if she HAD been able to determine that two black men were breaking in?  Would she have mentioned race?  And if she had, would she be vilified as a racist?</p>
<p>After all, what is more important to the Left and to blacks:  the truth, or hiding it?<br>

		<p>Two observations:</p>
<p>Everyone with a racial agenda seems to forget that their finger-pointing is done from a position of luxury.  Who considers the fear in which police live every day, as they respond to 911 calls that could potential end in their getting killed in the line of duty?  But no, all that seems to matter is that they make no political mistake during every second of every encounter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see some of the whiners respond to a 911 call.</p>
<p><br>
Second observation:</p>
<p>Obama used beer as a metaphor for &#8220;let&rsquo;s all get along, we&rsquo;re regular guys&#8221;.</p>
<p>But he forgot that his Muslim constituents don&rsquo;t use alcohol (neither do Mormons).  What kind of message is he sending them?  Is he anti-Muslim now?  Is he turning his back on his heritage?  etc etc?</p>

<p>While I will admit that I am not a fan of too many Blacks or other non-Whites for that mater, the fact is that i cannot say that I have a lot of respect for cops either. </p>
<p>It has been my experience that there are more than  few cops who abuse their power and are dishonest. Just because officer Crowley said that Professor Gates made such a comment does not mean it is true. In fact, it may vety well be false. </p>
<p>In fact, in some cities police corruption is rampant. Yes. There are many good decent police officers, but here are a number of who have no business wearing a badge and should be in prison themselves.</p>

		<p>Do you realize how many resources this race nonsense consumes?</p>
<p>You should hear the blacks point of view bloviated at MSNBC.</p>
<p>It is clear we are of two worlds and NEVER the twain shall meet.</p>
<p>It is time for whites to stop always being on the defensive and demand our right to self-determination and association. This country needs racial separation. Or whites simply need another country.</p>
<p>P.S. Republicans are for globalization, immigration and continued wars which are killing over 80% white. Whites will not do well under current Democratic or Republican rule.</p>
<p>P.P.S. If I see a black breaking into a house, I will think twice before calling the cops. Who wants to have to hire an attorney and go on national television defending oneself against accusations of racism? Insanity.</p>

		<p>  I have to give President Obama credit his beer summit was a very smart political move. He just sat back and let professor Gates and Officer Crowley talk it out. Neither appeared willing to back off. I can&rsquo;t agree with those who think that Dr. Gates was being deliberately intimidated by a bully white cop because Mr. Gates is a short black man. Verbal abuse invites a reaction and Officer Crowley played it by the book and never laid a hand on Dr. Gates.  It was the Governor of Massachusetts, Dival Patrick, and President Obama that should have excused themselves from commenting on a purely local matter under investigation. </p>

&#8220;It really amazes me (though it shouldn&rsquo;t) to see all the characters in this silly little drama desperately protesting that they aren&rsquo;t racists. Heavens no! Perish the very thought. And all claim that their actions had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with race.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s amazing as well, but I&rsquo;m further amazed that only a few of the people following this are aware enough to understand that the only racists in this entire situation is Gates and Obama and demand they answer for their racist conduct and assertions.   Remember, it was Obama, who said this type of profiling continues on throughout the US to blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>I truly believe the messiah had the question prepared beforehand to give to the useful idiot reporter.  And the reason for it?  He thought by saying what he did he would bring to bear considerable highlighting and therefore immense pressure on what is incorrectly termed &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221;  Remember too, it was Gates who was hopping from foot to foot with glee saying that he had succeeded in bringing attention to racial profiling and that a national dialogue would have to take place.</p>
<p>Both the messiah and gates, obviously, were too dimwitted to foresee that the situation would backfire the way it did.  There was no apology to the cop, because their plan didn&rsquo;t work out as intended.  </p>
<p>The talk shows should pick up on situations like this and shine the light of truth on them,  discussing the high crime rate among blacks and mestizos as reasons police might be wary of them.</p>
<p>Too the high incarceratin rate among blacks and mestizos is because they commit more crimes than any other group.  If blacks are too stupid to connect the two for cause and effect, then whites are stupid for not pointing out the high non-white crime rates.  </p>
<p>To an experienced strategist in psychological warfare, black and mestizo complaining about racial profiling and high incarceration rates would be a dream come true, because he would highlight it so consistently blacks and mestizos wouldn&rsquo;t ever dream of bringing it up again.</p>
<p>But whites are mostly managers not clever military in-fighters that go for the throat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame.  Now look at what we have.  Blacks committing unfounded racial accusations that they themselves are guilty of, and complaints from them for being locked up because they commit so many crimes.</p>
<p>Is anybody going to wise up and/or grow a spine besides some of us among the herd?</p>

<p>&#8220;As for worshipping law enforcement? That&rsquo;s preposterous: in reality, most people can&rsquo;t stand the police&hellip;until they need one.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not disagree with you more.  Most people, at least those in my circles, have nothing but the utmost respect for law inforcement.  Sure, there are those that do not serve the badge honorably, but what profession doesn&rsquo;t have a small  number of members who behave badly.</p>
<p>I believe the job of our law enforcement is a difficult one at best and only a select few can do it effectively.  I know I couldn&rsquo;t.  My temper would get the best of me; especially when it comes to dealing with some of the mouthy blacks that are our there i.e. &#8216;Professor&rsquo; Gates.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and Gates is an idiot but not as much an idiot as those Whites that enpowered him.  A PHD in Afro-Studies, huh?  What job does that qualify one for other than being a loud mouthed &#8216;racess&rsquo;! NO VALUE ADDED!<br>

		<p>really, if Obama came from a decent ethnic background, he would have served (for example) shots of Jameson whiskey to all. </p>
<p>Keep it going for several hours. Everyone would be &#8220;honest&#8221;. Video the whole thing. </p>
<p>Would &#8220;Professor&#8221; Gates be the most profane? Would Obama start to cry and curse his feckless father, and wish he, the President, were white? </p>
<p>Would Officer Crowley, once Gates made a move on him, lock Gates&rsquo; hands behind his back, ram a knee in his back, and quietly declare, &#8220;Henry, you are under arrest for fraud and for being a baby.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;you just don&rsquo;t get along with folks you have nothing in common with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;re right, though there are always exceptions.<br>
But mostly, you&rsquo;re right.  The problem here is, your words describe how most Whites feel about each other. <br>
As everyone here, and not just here, knows all too well, the one thing Whites all have in common, ie; being White, has not been near enough to unite us. <br>
What a shame too; because as soon as we do unite, at least for practical purposes, you know, with things like SURVIVAL!, we are going to be more than a force to be reckoned with.  And they know this, hence the Hate Speech Laws, and the bullying when just ONE White man comes to defend White interests, ie; Jared Taylor in Cananda, for example.<br>
But the point still stands.  The one thing all Whites have in common, Race, still evokes no answering emotion in most of us.<br>
Still, the bright side is that some do indeed seem to be waking up, and not just because of Obama&rsquo;s response to the whole sordid affair, but to Crowely&rsquo;s compsure, professionalism, and maturity. </p>

<i>&#8220;After all, what is more important to the Left and to blacks: the truth, or hiding it?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Hiding it.</p>
<p>Last fall, the Buffalo News ran an article, with photos, of a man suspected in a series of rapes. He was clearly black and the location suggested the victims were white.</p>
<p>I said he was suspected in a series of sexual attacks. The Buffalo News didn&rsquo;t report this story until there were seven attacks. Rather than report that a rapist was in the neighborhood, especially a black rapist, the Buffalo News let six more women fall victim to this predator because they didn&rsquo;t want to report that white women were being attacked by a black man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how liberals think. Even feminists don&rsquo;t seem to be bothered that women are attacked as long as the race of the rapist is protected. </p>

<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t particularly care for cops OR blacks, so I can&rsquo;t take anyone&rsquo;s side on this one. If you ask me, the police [and] the African &#8216;community&rsquo; in the United States deserve each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>YES. Very well said. Neither pro-police conservatives, nor minority-loving liberals grasp this understanding at all.</p>
<p>Actually blacks and cops often have a lot in common. Each group stands by its own members whether right or WRONG (it&rsquo;s the WRONG part that is troubling), practice brutality with sadistic glee, upon getting power often abuse it, take advantage of their authority to practice corruption, and so on. </p>
<p>Police are concerned with &#8220;respect for the badge.&#8221; Unfortunately, what too many officers really want is cringing fear and abject submission. This isn&rsquo;t appropriate treatment towards a free people. When an educated and dignified citizen is subjected to this kind of treatment, it generates feelings of extreme resentment towards the police. </p>
<p>Many officers don&rsquo;t give a damn about the public&rsquo;s feelings   &mdash;   and there lies the crux of the problem. Someone in a position of responsibility has to intervene and explain to these officers that the intimidating, bullying treatment is only for crime prone lowlifes, hoodlums, and sociopaths, not respectable citizens who are cooperative with the officer. A respectable citizen has the right to &#8220;talk back&#8221; to an officer if they feel that a situation is not fair. If the cops don&rsquo;t like the rights of US citizens, then they should move to China or Cuba and become a cop there. </p>
<p>I agree with #22 Anonymous in this Professor Gates affair. Gates was truly going into prima donna hysterics. He was completely obnoxious. But Crowley abused his power to get even. I don&rsquo;t like Gates nor Crowley. Perhaps they deserve each other as #22 said. </p>
<p>#24 Quiet Professional said &#8220;&hellip;most people can&rsquo;t stand the police&hellip;until they need one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. If you can get them to do their job.</p>
