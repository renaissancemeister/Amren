			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Construction News (London), July 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Plans for the construction of a five-storey building which will be one of London&rsquo;s biggest mosques have been given the go-ahead.</p>
<p>Harrow Central Mosque will serve Muslim worshippers from across north London when it is built on Station Road. The designs include a 40m-high minaret, a gym, a crèche [day-care center] and a café within the 5,745 square metre development.</p>
<p>It is expected to open next year after Harrow Council approved changes to the original plans, which were passed in June 2000.</p>
<p>The planning committee has imposed conditions on the build, which include that a house on Station Road currently being used as the mosque is turned into affordable housing. The Mosque builders will also pay £15,000 towards controlled parking measures in Rosslyn Crescent.</p>
<p>Councillor Marilyn Ashton, cabinet member for planning, development and enterprise, said: &#8220;This is a very significant building on Harrow&rsquo;s skyline and while permission was given some while ago, it was important we regularised changes that had been made. I&rsquo;m pleased that we have been able to give formal permission while at the same time balancing that with the views of local residents.&#8221;<br>

								<h2>About Harrow Central Mosque</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Harrow Central Mosque</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The mosque in its current form is located adjacent to the new building. At present it is far too small to service the whole of the Muslim community presently residing in Harrow. The new mosque project therefore aims to provide a purpose-built mosque which will become a cultural centre for Muslims residing in Harrow and further a field.</p>
<p>Following the completion of the external work on the building, it is plain to see that the new mosque is something special. The building is not only aesthetically pleasing up close, but is also a landmark that can be seen from miles away.</p>
<p>The new mosque is not only a place of prayer. The intention is that it will become an educational resource centre as well as a place of interest for Muslims and non-Muslims alike.</p>

		<p>A country has a cultural landscape.  To desecrate the cultural landscape with foreign objects is an affront to the indigenous inhabitants.</p>
<p>This is like planting a huge cross or Western flag in the center of Mecca.  All mosques on Western soil are an unanswered provocation by an invading people.  Our passive acceptance stimulates their further aggression.</p>

		<p>How disgusting. All the beautiful chapels and cathedrals in Great Britain. Mosques (and British Islam) are an ugly symbol of the death of Britain. </p>
<p>All the sacrifices Britain made against Continental Europe for over a thousand years, the Battle of Britain-all for nothing. I have rethought my youthful opposition to the Crusades. I understand them, and wish a decisive victory against Islam had been secured. </p>
<p>There was a chance to remove the Muslims from Britain after 9/11, but that moment has passed. Blair, and most British pols are effeminate wimps, who have no love of British tradition. You know, that white, sexist, Christian tradition.</p>

		<p>Comments of surprise and/or indignation are really unmerited.<br>
    The fact is that London is already a non-White majority city with muslims forming a very substantial proportion of the population.Undoubtedly the numbers of worshippers at mosque on a Friday is perhaps an order of magnitude greater than those attendig church on a Sunday.</p>

		<p>YUP! Englandistan is gone, gone, gone. If Councillor Marilyn Ashton, cabinet member for planning, development and enterprise,<br>
Thinks the muslims will adhere to ANY restrictions after construction is going on she is delusional. The 40m high minarete I guarantee, will be at least 60m and no one better say ANYTHING about it&hellip;mustn&rsquo;t outrage the black, Paki muslims. As in Kuwait and Saudi, there will also shortly be a mosque EVERY 1000m in each direction from tha last one. The entire skyline of Kuwait City is minarets.</p>

<p><br>
Just a few days ago the last British surviving veteran of WW1 passed away.   If only he had spoken out about the present conditions! If only he had said something!  Is this what his sacrifice (and that of so many others) was for? Did they fight for THIS?<br>
Or maybe he did say something, but they silenced him.</p>

		<p>We know for absolute certain that MOST of the indigenous white majority do not want this - because none of them buy the houses that come up for sale in sight of this monstrosity.</p>
<p>You must keep reminding everybody of this fact. You don&rsquo;t have to say you support it, or that you believe Islam shouldn&rsquo;t be here in your country - just ask the question: How is it that these areas become majority immigrant, when the majority of the general population is still white? Why aren&rsquo;t white people moving into those areas?</p>

		<p>Do the people who approved this mosque realise that according to Islamic teaching, once a mosque is erected in a &#8220;kafir&#8221; country it then legally becomes Muslim and the Muslims have the right to claim it for Allah?</p>
<p>Now I realise that there are already mosques in the UK, but to allow the building of something of this magnitude surely sends signals to the Muslim &#8220;community&#8221; that Allah is blessing their endeavours and that it is time to accellerate the programme. The British are unwittingly slitting their own throats.</p>

		<p>Why are they building new mosques? Why don&rsquo;t they just erect minarets around Salisbury Cathedral and turn it into a mosque and call it &#8220;Islamic architecture.&#8221; (Don&rsquo;t the Greeks know something about that?) I&rsquo;m sure that the Archbishop would love the idea as part of his commitment to tolerance and diversity. </p>

<p>The Emir of Kuwait and the King of Saudia said &#8220;there will be no more christian churches built on muslim land&#8221; this in response to the Philippine embassy&rsquo;s request for another Catholic church to accomodate the @ 9 million Philippine Catholics enslaved by the Saudis and Kuwaitis.</p>

<p>Probably, let&rsquo;s ask any non-muslims from Dearborne, Michiganistan (if there are any left) and NOW, the call is electronic audio of varying types since the black muslims in America are to lazy to climb into the towers and YELL PRAYERS 5 times a day (usually), especially the 0415 prayers..they were busy violating other muslim tenets the night before.</p>

		<p>I think hsitory may be repeating itself.</p>
<p>The Crusades happenned because of Muslim expansion becoming a very serious threat. </p>
<p>When the soldiers and knights from the West retook Jerusalem from the Muslim Arabs, they killed every single one of those invaders, down to the last man, woman and child, and burned their dead bodies on pyres.</p>
<p>Will we, one day, have a War of the Religions? If so, I think we will win! And then perhaps, as they did nearly a thousand years ago, the fires will consume the contemporary Muslims invaders, once again.</p>
