<h1>Akron Police Investigate Teen Mob Attack on Family</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phil Trexler, Akron Beacon Journal, July 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Akron police say they aren&rsquo;t ready to call it a hate crime or a gang initiation.</p>
<p>But to Marty Marshall, his wife and two kids, it seems pretty clear.</p>
<p>It came after a family night of celebrating America and freedom with a fireworks show at Firestone Stadium. Marshall, his family and two friends were gathered outside a friend&rsquo;s home in South Akron.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, the six were attacked by dozens of teenage boys, who shouted &#8220;This is our world&#8221; and &#8220;This is a black world&#8221; as they confronted Marshall and his family.</p>
<p>The Marshalls, who are white, say the crowd of teens who attacked them and two friends June 27 on Girard Street numbered close to 50. The teens were all black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They said it started when one teen, without any words or warning, blindsided and assaulted Marshall&rsquo;s friend as he stood outside with the others.</p>
<p>When Marshall, 39, jumped in, he found himself being attacked by the growing group of teens.</p>
<p>His daughter, Rachel, 15, who weighs about 90 pounds, tried to come to his rescue. The teens pushed her to the ground.</p>
<p>His wife, Yvonne, pushed their son, Donald, 14, into bushes to keep him protected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After several minutes of punches and kicks, the attack ended and the group ran off. The Marshalls&rsquo; two adult male friends were not seriously hurt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew I was going to get beat, but not as bad as I did,&#8221; Marshall said. &#8220;But I did it to protect my family. I didn&rsquo;t have a choice. There was no need for this. We should be all getting along. But to me, it seems to be racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Akron police are investigating. Right now, the case is not being classified as a racial hate crime. There were no other reports of victims assaulted by the group that night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Marshalls say they fear retaliation at home or when they go outside. They are considering arming themselves, but they&rsquo;re concerned about the possible problems that come with guns.</p>

		<p>Sadly, this is not a surprise. When young blacks gather, their courage is magnified and they act out in stupid and destructive ways. Standing in the street and blocking cars is a black only problem in my suburban city. Alone they are almost universally complete cowards. When challenged alone, they invariably back down.</p>
<p>  A gun is a fine idea IMO. The look of surprise on their faces when they see it is something I wont forget. My gun has saved me no less than twice, and an innocent (black no less)bystander at least once.  I carry mine every day, and no one is the wiser until I need it. </p>

		<p>South Akron, Ohio. Sounds like a heavily black area to me. I am not blaming the victims, but I would not be out at night in any area where there are a lot of blacks. &#8220;This is our world&#8221;. They demand color blindness from us, but they are completely territorial when it comes to their neighborhoods.Just let  them wait until  hispanics arrive in larger numbers. They will not be pushed around so easily.</p>

		<p>The possible problems that come with guns are negligible compared to the problems that come with not having guns.  I once brought a gun to a street beating.  The sight of it at my side, dangling in my hand, was enough to convince the beater to go home.  In the right hands, a gun is a first class problem solver.</p>

		<p>Funny. Even though it&rsquo;s been among the ohio dot com&rsquo;s &#8220;most read stories&#8221; for the last 24 hours, nobody seems to have anything to say in their comments section, although there&rsquo;s no shortage of discourse on the &#8220;Man falls into vat of chocolate in N.J.&#8221; story or any other story on the site, for that matter. How very unusual. </p>

		<p>It is unfortunate that these people were insensitive to the fact that this IS a black world and that they, as evil white people, have a limited place in it. They are here to do the work that needs to be done, and to earn the money that pays the taxes that funds the midnight basketball, food stamps, ADC payments and public defenders the black world demands. (and someday soon the reparations payments)</p>
<p>As for the medical bills, those will soon be paid by Obama Care, which means it will be taken out of the man&rsquo;s paycheck before he even sees it, in order to pay for the medical care of those who sent him to the ER.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t you dare call this a hate crime. Only whites commit hate crimes. This was merely a demonstration of black solidarity in the face of honkie oppression and like that.</p>

		<p>My God! If the police aren&rsquo;t going to call THAT a hate crime, when would they ever? I&rsquo;m gobsmacked. If it&rsquo;s really true that whites can&rsquo;t expect just when they&rsquo;re the victims of hate crimes, no matter how clear the evidence, I can see no reason to remain loyal to this nation and this government.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s particularly aggravating about all of this is that there is no European-American rights group to stick up for this family and demand that charges be brought against the blacks who took part in this. </p>
<p>Had the situation been reversed, you would have Al Sharkton, Jesse Jack-Son and every other racial grievance-monger demanded swift and immediate police action and that the perps be brought up on &#8220;hate crime&#8221; charges.</p>
<p>This was an obvious hate crime, and why it hasn&rsquo;t been classified as such is a complete outrage! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to know how The Marshalls voted in 2008.  If they voted Obama, then they really did vote to make this world &#8220;their world&#8221; for their assailants.  I suspect they did vote Obama, because of their anti-gun rant at the end of this article.</p>

		<p>We all know that if a black family was attacked by some white kids shouting &#8220;this is a white world&#8221; that it probably would make history books for years to come and it would be used to throw guilt on us for generations to come.  </p>

		<p>The blindside punch is the assault of choice for blacks. The Jena Six did it to the white kid they stomped in a high school gymnasium. An unidentified black assailant did it to Lt Ben Vargas in a bathroom hours after he filed his anti-discrimination law suit with Frank Ricci. An elderly white woman was recently punched blindside by some black homeless guy on a Seattle bus. Check Live Leak for convenience store security cam footage of various clerks being stomped: black assailants always begin with the blindside punch.</p>

		<p>We are fed so many categories for criminal behaviours. Not just the &#8220;hate crime&#8221; tag, but the Akron police are now investigating whether this was &#8220;gang related&#8221; or &#8220;just a group of kids&#8221; https://www.ohio.com/news/50172282.html<br>
Based on statistics alone these &#8220;just a group of kids&#8221; are effectively just as well organized, and perhaps more of a present danger to many Americans, than those we hear of called &#8220;terrorists&#8221;.</p>

Look folks, these two statements alone sent up red flags in my mind. CLUELESS LIBERALS!!! They&rsquo;re probably gathered together discussing what THEY did to provoke this assault and wondering if they should volunteer in the inner city so as to better &#8220;understand&#8221; the anger of these black &#8220;youths&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Of course they aren&rsquo;t ready to call it a hate crime or a gang initiation. I know I don&rsquo;t need to say this, but I will anyway. Imagine if a black family had come from a 4th of July celebration and been attacked by a group of whites shouting &#8220;this is our world. this is a white world&#8221; </p>
<p>Its amazing that these groups of dozens of black males can spring up so spontaniously. Over and over again. </p>

<p> In conversation with honest police officers you will learn thet by virtue of blacks being a &#8220;protected class&#8221; they will rarely, if ever be charged with a hate crime.</p>

		<p>&#8221; They are concerned about the possible problems that come with a gun&#8221; And rightfully so! But what they realy mean is they fear the &#8220;legal ramifications&#8221; of using a gun. </p>
<p>Because urban regions in the north are rampantly anti- gun, whites fear legal retaliation more than street retaliation. Blacks know this and almost never assume a white will be armed and engage in cowardly wilding against their greatly outnumberd white victim(s). </p>
<p>A white middle class man who kills or wounds black attackers with a firearm runs a very high risk of being indicted by a grand jury. Even if he beats the criminal charge, he&rsquo;ll get nailed on civil charges and then its good-bye middle class lifestyle. Most whites have something to lose, most blacks dont.</p>
<p>Whites are faced with a bogus choice,(more so in the north): Remain unarmed and take your chances becoming a victim or, kill/wound your aggressors and be sued into oblivion. I personally choose the latter.</p>

You know if the colors were reversed and a bunch of white kids were yelling &#8220;it&rsquo;s a white world&#8221; that all hell would break loose and the naacp and all the good monkey reverends would be heading to Akron faster than you can say &#8220;Reparations&#8221;.

		<p>  It is a wonder the white family was not charged with a hate crime.  Call the &#8220;police&#8221; and unfortunately the innocent stand a good chance to  be made out to be guilty. (Unless the innocent are a member of some special minority group.)  I have learned this by experience.  White people MUST learn to be aware of their environment and take no foolish chances, because they do not have an advocate in this country.  Fourth of July-what a joke anymore.</p>

		<p>This goes on daily in this country. With Whites the victims. So how long do we take it?  When it is black on white crime it seems the question is always, &#8220;well did the Whites say or do something offensive to the blacks&#8221;.. like the victim is the one who is at fault. Until Whites get a backbone and stand up against this assault on our race then nothing will change, it will only encourage more of the same.</p>

		<p>Dwayne O said &#8220;&hellip;I can see no reason to remain loyal to this nation and this government&#8221;. I think that is the critical issue. As this country is changed forever, never to return to the sanity that was present during it&rsquo;s inception and growth, what of value is left? How can one possibly feel pride and respect for a country that is no longer a reflection of the people who designed it, but rather a quota flea market of racial spoils? I think we often try to express optimism in the hope that things will work out, but if history and geography are our teachers, we already know this cannot work. What awaits us is essentially a third-world country. Look to the poor souls in South Africa, with their extreme (and ill reported) ethnic violence, failing infrastructure, affirmative action, and black empowerment. Ultimately, there&rsquo;s nothing but a bag full of excuses.</p>

		<p>BowleDover, the reason there are no comments for that story is because the Ohio.com is NOT letting us comment on the story. They have turned OFF the comment option for that story.<br>
Why? Because they know the things that will be said are the same things that are being said on all other forums around the country about it!<br>

		<p>Police don&rsquo;t want to call it a hate crime yet or gang initiation, so they say. </p>
<p>I guess they want to wait a while then call it one or the other, because they always play down black on white attacks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they always do.  They probably think it&rsquo;s their duty to keep a lid on things, so they&rsquo;ll say whatever is necessary to keep whitey from fighting back.  </p>
<p>They want us to believe in almost every anti-white hate crime that occurs the perps are not part of mainstream blacks but are gang members.  By marginalizing the perps they expect to continue to keep whitey from reacting.</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is that Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s congregants applauding and cheering his hate-whitey rhetoric are the rule for black feelings towards whites.  They&rsquo;re not the exceptions, and this mob of blacks are not gang members either.  By failing to denounce the racist, hateful black criminality, the authorities and the media encourage it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get worse. </p>

		<p>Why was this not a lead story on the national TV news?  Oh, I forgot, the hours of special news on Michael Jackson.  If this Akron assault had happened in reverse, white teens attacking a Black family, we would be reminded of this horrible racist attack every night for a year.  Of course, the Akron violence was a racist attack.  But to the acadamedia complex, Blacks cannot be racist.  So the Akron attack does not exist in the national media.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -HM </p>

		<p>My neck of the woods, more or less.  There&rsquo;s a reason why people call it CRACKron.</p>
<p>Rolling Acres Mall in Akron closed recently, most likely due to white shoppers being harassed by blacks and the mall losing business as a result.</p>
<p>This reminds me of an incident at a fireworks show in or around 1991 in Detroit.  A pair of twin black girls was charged with beating a white woman.  I think one was found not guilty.  Cassandra and Cossandra Rutherford were their names.</p>

		<p>Was at the funeral for the mother of one of my (very few) black friends Tuesday morning. It was a little different from the other funerals for the parents of friends that I seem to be attending a lot of lately, but not THAT different.</p>
<p>It occured to me there that, for all the things I post here sometimes, I really and truly don&rsquo;t detest the entire race. It&rsquo;s just the 80% or so that act out like the &#8220;youths&#8221; in this article.</p>
<p>It also occured to me how vulnerable an open-minded white person is in this society nowadays. We just don&rsquo;t seem capable of hating blacks the way they hate us, and it makes it easier for them to act out on us. Sometimes I wish I possessed their purity of feeling&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, for most other stories they have a link for posting comments, but not on that story.  I find that in general newspapers forbid comments on stories about black crime because too many of the comments that would be posted would reflect our point of view.</p>

<p>Right, ohio.com is not accepting comments on this story (they provide no means to comment, unlike their other stories).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this done a few times at knoxnews.com where I post regularly  &mdash;  on a recent article about an argument between a Knoxville mosque (yes, a Knoxville mosque) and one of its neighbors, the site wiped out the comment thread after a few comments because the comments weren&rsquo;t to the site management&rsquo;s liking.</p>
<p>The MSM is not kidding about keeping the lid on any potential white racial feelings. </p>
<p>This article should be an eye opener for the white population of Akron. The story probably won&rsquo;t be seen much anywhere outside of Ohio, so please keep the story in mind for whenever you read an article about black misbehavior anywhere else, so you can recover the link to this story by advance searching &#8220;Akron&#8221; on amren.com with google, and then post the link on the article you&rsquo;re reading. </p>
<p>This seems to me one of the most telling articles we have, and it&rsquo;s time for the country to start reading some real black history!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to Eric Holder&rsquo;s very interesting responses to sharp questioning by Senator Sessions and Senator Coburn on the proposed new &#8220;hate crime&#8221; law:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnziaXfYhc4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnziaXfYhc4</a></p>

		<p>&#8220;They demand color blindness from us, but they are completely territorial when it comes to their neighborhoods&#8221;</p>
<p>We have to remember that blacks truly are on the average stupid. It&rsquo;s not just something we say here, it&rsquo;s really true, confirmed by years of IQ studies.</p>
<p>When this really sinks in, a lot of their behavior makes perfect &#8220;sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>And even the ones who have some intelligence don&rsquo;t often discipline their minds into rational thought processes. What their minds produce are mostly just verbal expressions of their emotions and desires.</p>
<p>So, as times get tougher, they will blame whites for that (it&rsquo;s their most reliable mental process, after all), and there will be more mass attacks like this Akron one, except they will be inspired by more explicit bitterness and hatred rather than just black youngsters&rsquo; spirited disposition to &#8220;party.&#8221;</p>
<p>At some point surely whites will become enraged that legally they are now as sheep tethered for the delectation of packs of wolves, and will begin to react in some form.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m still alive to see that day arrive. It will be very unpleasant (I&rsquo;m old and don&rsquo;t like commotion), but also extremely satisfying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its amazing that these groups of dozens of black males can spring up so spontaneously.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As an educator in Akron I can tell you that this behavior is the norm, rather then not. This same behavior is prominent in our Akron Public Schools. We can have a couple students disagreeing in the hallway or cafeteria and, in seconds, there will be 25 to 30 fighting, screaming and &#8220;wilding&#8221;. This behavior is becoming a part of their culture and it will only get worse. We just had the poor 68 year old white guy in Rootstown that was asked by a white girl to use the phone because her car, supposedly, broke down. when he offered to assist her, 3 black bastards broke in and beat him so badly that he is paralyzed from the neck down. In a couple more years there will be no white people in the large cities in Ohio, except for the white trash that likes to hang out with them. Just shoot them when they attack.</p>

A leftist relative of mine once sent me FBI statistics supposedly showing how blacks are victims of &#8220;hate-crimes&#8221; more often than whites.  I retorted that that the label &#8220;hate-crime&#8221; is typically only applied when the victim is not white.  If I send the relative articles like this one, his response is, &#8220;please stop sending me those articles&#8221;.  This is the way of the leftist: willful ignorance.</p>

		<p>From Anon #39:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Not too long ago, I saw a few Blacks working the streets in my almost all-White Neighborhood, and going door to door. I got myself ready for any eventuality, and then the front door bell rang.</p>
<p>The oustide Storm Door was locked, and there, one of those wondering Pan Handlers stood, asking for, what else, money&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was most likely casing your house for easy entry for a break-in robbery later, and the rest of the gang was noting how many residents are home, how many are outside, possible escape routes.</p>
<p>I also saw blacks canvassing my White California neighborhood last night when I was walking my pit bull/police dog mix  &mdash;  he positively despises blacks and hispanics and barks and growls ferociously whenever he spots them, even from a large distance.  </p>
<p>When this happened before, I called the police and couldn&rsquo;t get past a PC dispatcher who wanted to know MY drivers license # and also why I suspected a group of young blacks hanging out on a street corner in a White neighborhood as any kind of threat.  I asked her what was the point of the large sign in my neighborhood that says &#8216;Neighborhood Watch, Call Police for Suspicious Activity?&rsquo;<br>
Idiot didn&rsquo;t understand any of it, of course.</p>
<p>After my dog and I were finished with our evening constitution last night, I put him on a long steel cord in the front yard that reaches the boundaries of my property on each side.  In fact, I notice a lot of my neighbors are doing this as well with their dogs  &mdash;  the ones that haven&rsquo;t built nine-foot barricades around their property that is (we are one of the last holdouts, perhaps not for long).</p>
<p>I watched out my front window as the black group made a decision not to come down my street.  Hopefully, they went down a neighboring street that is now majority Armenian and they got a taste of their brand of justice.</p>
<p>Yeah, welcome to Southern California, Capital of the Third World.</p>

<p>Send that dude THESE Dept. of Justice Statistics, which show that blacks are raping over 35,000 white women a year, but whites are raping virtually ZERO black women!</p>
<p>(But didn&rsquo;t we hear plenty about that ZERO black woman that was (not)raped by the Duke Lacrosse team, and hear NOTHING about the over 35,000 white women that WERE raped by blacks!) </p>
<p>(Scroll down to Table 42):</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/6agtmq</p>
<p>This data also shows that the percentage of the black male population that rapes white women is 4 TIMES the percentage of the white male population that rapes white women. (A useful response to the innumerates who will pounce on you with the fact that the absolute number of rapes of white women by whites is about 1 and 1/3 times the absolute number of rapes of white women by blacks).</p>
<p>For murder, the graph and table at the DOJ page below show that the percentage of the black population that murders whites who are strangers is 3 TIMES the percentage of the white male population that murders whites who are strangers.</p>
<p>(&#8220;4 TIMES&#8221; AND &#8220;3 TIMES&#8221; are computed from the white population being 5 to 6 times the size of the black population in this country).</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2n9lkc</p>
<p>(Stranger murder is considered a small percentage of total murder, but I believe that is because the high proportion of murder victims that are among the criminal classes skews the figures towards friend and acquaintance murder. I believe I and all decent whites are at least as much in danger of being murdered by a (more often black) stranger as by our family, friends, or acquaintances.)</p>

		<p>The unspoken assumption behind liberal exculpation of black crime, whether against whites or not, is not that inner-city blacks are the victims of their circumstances  &mdash;  or &#8220;root causes&#8221; as Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote.  That&rsquo;s a red herring the Left has traded on for 50 years to corral and manipulate the black vote.  </p>
<p>The unspoken liberal assumption is just this:  that blacks are so inferior that they are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong.  Every liberal excuse, every liberal attempt to smother such stories as this one, implies this truth about liberal hypocricy.  Liberals claim that black criminality is caused by living in slums, while their policies make it perfectly clear that, in their view, blacks are incapable of living anywhere else.</p>

		<p>With all due respect my brothers, I have to disagree with the notion of buying a firearm with the intent of using it only to intimidate.  Yes, I would imagine most times the would be attacker would back down.  However, you will have those that will challange the bluff or walk away and come back with their own gun or even pull their weapon right then and there.</p>
<p>No, the risks are too great.  If one decides to use a firearm for protection, the goal should be this and only this: Quickly make your face and the barrel of the gun the last thing the threat ever sees, period, end of story.  It takes a lot of practice and many rounds of ammo to get to that level of proficiency.  Don&rsquo;t let the first time you decide to use your gun be in a life or death situation.  If one is not ready to make that level of commitment then do not draw or even own the weapon.</p>
<p>Personally, I will take out the trash before I take a beating&hellip;no brag&hellip;just fact.</p>
<p>The world is on fire and unfortunately, a lot of us may find that we have come to terms with making these types of decisions.</p>

		<p>I posted the below to a story concerning Jena Six.  I think each time I see a story about black on White crime, I&rsquo;ll post something similar.</p>
<p>Folks, crimes of this nature are not going to stop. It may have very well happened already and just did not get the publicity due to its sensitive nature. Suppose a Black man or group kills or seriously hurts a White because they claim the White calling them ni**er(s). It doesn&rsquo;t matter if this really happened or not. All that matters is the Black says he did. The Black(s)&rsquo; defense/justification for killing the White will be that the White called him the N-Word and he just lost control of his emotions/actions. It is very concievable that the sentence/charges would be reduced (or, heaven forbid, dismissed who knows under Obama). There will be no mention of a hate crime. At least, not on the part of the Black. Of course, us Whites would, as usual, hush up and move on.</p>
<p>Be ready to act on this scenario my brothers because I believe it&rsquo;s going to happen if it hasn&rsquo;t already.</p>

If the (acorn) census worker comes to the door, ask for a driver&rsquo;s license.  If they refuse, DO NOT DEAL WITH THEM.  Write down all information.  You may need it for the subsequent break in and invasion of your home.<br>
The only question you are legally required to answer is &#8220;how many people reside in your household?&#8221;.  If you are white, you should have at least SIX people.  acorn stole the election by fraud.  Maybe we can change apportionment by taking the census.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see any other way for a small middle-aged female with children, grandchildren and animals to protect than to use deadly force.  Most NAMs have no conscious  and are impervious to reason  &mdash;  but they do understand the business end of a shotgun (the clack-clack is understood in all languages).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made this point before:  To all MEN.  Make sure your females, your daughters, your wives and girlfriends are able to protect themselves with deadly force if necessary!  Teach them not to make themselves vulnerable.  Encourage them if possible to learn to handle guns safely and to practice shooting, a lot of practice.</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s rights include the right to defend oneself.</p>
<p>I know this is difficult with a lot of females who either take a &#8216;helpless&rsquo; role or who feel &#8216;guns cause crime&rsquo; or &#8216;guns are more likely to be used on family members over dishwashing&rsquo; or &#8216;kids may get their hands on them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My children have taken gun safety classes specifically for kids and know the power and danger of guns.</p>
<p>Look, I live in Kalifornia, the unemployment rate is posted at 11% by the government which means it is probably double that, we are run by White-hating liberal kooks, especially around LA.  Yesterday, Scharzenegger announced that Kalifornia has 12% of the general population and 30% of the welfare population and they are about to have the benefits curtailed sharply as we are out of money here.</p>
<p>Would you like a voucher instead of your paycheck?  A voucher the banks won&rsquo;t even take?  I heard a lot of business people on my radio show last night who had received them as payment for services provided to the state and cannot pay their employees.</p>
<p>The situation is dire here and it is becoming less safe.  Forewarned is forearmed as the old expression goes.  Call me Cassandra if you wish (and as my family does) but I am ready to defend myself and my property if necessary.</p>

		<p>I live in Akron.  Already callers on the television are <br>
blaming the young girl who was knocked down.  &#8220;She must<br>
have know one of the boys and started some trouble.&#8221;  I kid<br>
you not. This is the mind set of these people. <br>
Get ready.  Bad moon rising.</p>

		<p>I have to ask why census workers would be coming to people&rsquo;s doors to begin with.  I remember that in 2000 forms were mailed to everyone, and you filled it out and mailed it back in.  According to the Census 2010 site, forms will be mailed out this coming March.</p>
<p>No ACORN nut is going to darken our doorstep for more than a moment, because we&rsquo;ll tell them to scram.</p>

<p>Reminds me of when kids fight, one thing that&rsquo;s done is to separate them.  Sounds like a good idea in this case, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p><b> THIS; </b><i>&hellip;attacked by dozens of (black) teenage boys, who shouted&hellip;&ldquo;This is a black world&rdquo; </i></p>
<p><b> FOLLOWED BY THIS;</b> <i>We should be all getting along. But to me, it <b>seems</b> to be racist.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b>ENDING WITH THIS</b>;<i>Akron police are investigating. Right now, the case is not being classified as a racial hate crime.</i></p>
<p>Should startle even the most clueless but it won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Re your post #65:</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a &#8220;NAM&#8221;? Pardon my ignorance, but I have to ask. Else, it&rsquo;s all alphabet soup to me.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
