<h1>Experts: Did ACORN Elect Al Franken?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David A. Patten, Newsmax, July 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Democrat Al Franken&rsquo;s emergence as the victor of the marathon Minnesota election battle has triggered growing complaints from those who blame former Sen. Norm Coleman&rsquo;s defeat on the Association of Community Organizers for Reform Now (ACORN).</p>
<p>Matthew Vadum, senior editor for the Capital Research Center think tank, {snip} points out that ACORN registers voters who are expected to vote Democratic in overwhelming numbers, based on demographics. In the year leading up to the election, ACORN tallied 43,000 new registrations in Minnesota. That was likely a decisive factor in a contest decided by 312 votes out of nearly 3 million ballots cast.</p>
<p>Vadum comments, &#8220;It just seems probable that they got enough fraudulent registrations in, in order to swing the vote. But I don&rsquo;t have evidence that they did. More likely than not, it played a role.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Vadum tells Newsmax ACORN &#8220;set in motion a process that allowed an election to be stolen.&#8221;</p>
<p>That process, Vadum says, began when ACORN helped Minnesota&rsquo;s secretary of state, Mark Ritchie, get elected in 2006. Ritchie is a favorite son of the George Soros-funded Secretary of State Project (SOS), which has succeeded in installing partisans in key state positions that can influence election outcomes.</p>
<p>Ritchie, for example, presided over the recount that saw Coleman lose an apparent lead of 775 votes on Election Day. All of Coleman&rsquo;s legal challenges to that recount were thwarted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Justice Department and over a dozen states have launched investigations into ACORN&rsquo;s activities, charging ACORN set illegal quotas that pressured canvassers into submitting fraudulent registrations.</p>
<p>Prosecutors filed 39 felony counts against the group in Nevada. Four former ACORN workers are standing trial on charges in Pittsburgh that they forged or illegally solicited voter registrations in November. And in Ohio&rsquo;s Cuyahoga County, prosecutors have indicted Darnell Nash, a voter who was registered by ACORN, for voting illegally. Officials say Nash registered to vote on nine occasions, using different names and addresses each time. And investigators say as many as 4,000 ACORN voter registrations in Ohio may have been fraudulent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To some it seems curious that Minnesota, the only state with a marathon election dispute stemming from the 2008 election, has thus far refused to launch an investigation into ACORN or possible vote fraud. Investigators in Dakota County are looking into about 50 cases where felons may have voted illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Heather S. Heidelbaugh, vice president of the Republican National Lawyers Association, tells Newsmax: &#8220;When you&rsquo;re running for U.S. Senate and you&rsquo;re going to affect potentially the balance of the Senate, and potentially affect whether major pieces of legislation are passed and whether our nation changes course in major philosophical ways  &mdash;  you&rsquo;re talking about an enormous, enormous effect of potential fraud.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Specifically, von Spakovsky [Hans A. von Spakovsky, an election expert at the Heritage Foundation] says, &#8220;Minnesota really has no system for checking and verifying the accuracy of its voter registration system.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minnesota Majority has filed a lawsuit alleging that Ritchie and 25 county election officials failed to reconcile their registrations  &mdash;  the routine process of matching votes cast with actual people registered and living at valid addresses. Cleaning up the voter rolls periodically is required by law.</p>
<p>Minnesota Majority [a nonprofit organization with Republican backing] founder Jeff Davis says he&rsquo;s also very concerned also about votes cast illegally by felons, by non-citizens, and by individuals who provided residential addresses that do not exist, including &#8220;city parks, business developments, freeways, and empty lots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Minnesota is doing absolutely nothing to investigate or verify any of that information,&#8221; says Von Spakovsky. &#8220;It points out that in a close election where every vote counts, that kind of a sloppy system can allow someone to steal an election.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Davis is calling for a federal investigation of vote-registration procedures in the state. He tells Newsmax that the state&rsquo;s failure to reconcile its voter database casts a shadow over the validity of some 30,000 ballots cast in November.</p>

		<p>Voter fraud has become a major component of Democrat campaign strategy, without which they&rsquo;d lose many local and national races.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Democrat Party is always foremost in shrieking hysterically about &#8220;voter intimidation,&#8221; and thus &#8220;disenfranchisement&#8221; which usually takes the form of a cop being seen in the vicinity of a polling place in some inner city precinct.  Evidently they believe their constituents are so criminally inclined (they often are) that they&rsquo;re frightened away from a polling place by the mere presence of police.  Interesting supposition.</p>
<p>But actual voter fraud bothers them not all. They call it a &#8220;victimless crime,&#8221; quite overlooking the fact that every fraudulent ballot cast disenfranchises an honest and genuine voter. </p>
<p>Voter fraud should get the same penalty as espionage in wartime.  It&rsquo;s a direct assault on the integrity of the republic.</p>

<p>Where do you think the &#8220;dimpled chad&#8221; and the &#8220;hanging chad&#8221; in Florida in 2000 came from?  The only way it could have happened is if someone put multiple cards in the vote-o-matic and punched a hole for a certain candidate (i.e. Al Gore), some of the cards punched, some punched but the chad didn&rsquo;t break, some cards had their chad with a dimple but no perforation.</p>
<p>Black political machines, in St. Louis and elsewhere, are notorious for this:  They&rsquo;ll wait for the polls to close, and the legit voters to leave, and then they&rsquo;ll punch ballots for the registered voters that didn&rsquo;t show up.  This is why the Dems want motor-voter, no restrictions on ex-felons voting, or anything that makes it easy to register to vote, to get all those registered voters in the black ghetto precincts, so they&rsquo;re on the books and so that a poll worker can vote them after hours.</p>
<p>The reason they don&rsquo;t like cops around the polling places is because they know they&rsquo;re up to no good.</p>

		<p>This analysis is absolutely correct. In many states where ACORN has been active, criminality is a major factor in their campaign activities. </p>
<p>Forget the euphemisms of &#8220;liberal&#8221; or &#8220;progressive&#8221; politics in states such Wisconsin or Minnesota where ACORN has had a higher profile in recent years. ACORN favors eliminating minimal voter registration safeguards designed to prohibit vote fraud using the pretext that such laws have a disparate impact upon the poor. The reality is that ACORN wants to file faked voter registrations to tip the balance of power in elections.</p>
<p>A Wisconsin relative described several Democratic victories in his state as being within &#8220;the margin of vote fraud.&#8221; Liberal Minnesotans have a new senator elected on the basis of vote fraud. Friends have told me how active ACORN was in that state. To a less examined degree, ACORN stole caucuses and primaries from Hillary Clinton.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure there was fraud to some extent.  But in the big scheme of things does it really matter?  The real issue is the rapidly changing demographics in this country, not a few thousand votes forged by Marxist kooks.  And to be honest, Franken is not much worse than the gentleman he replaced.</p>

		<p>When the acorn (oops I mean census) worker comes to your door DO NOT COOPERATE.  They will be asking questions like &#8220;what time do you leave for work?&#8221; and &#8220;how many hours per day do you work?&#8221;.  These questions were designed to enable acorn criminals to set up home break ins and home invasions.<br>
The only question that you are legally (constitutionally) required to answer is &#8220;how many people live in your household?&#8221;.  If you are a white conservative, you should have at least SIX people in your household.  If you chose to answer the other invasive questions, LIE.<br>
If you choose to answer questions from the acorn (oops I mean census) worker, ASK FOR A DRIVER&rsquo;S LICENSE.  Do not answer any questions if your request to see ID is turned down. Write down all the information, name and address, driver&rsquo;s license number etc.  You may need it for police when your home gets broken into by acorn criminals.<br>
acorn stole the election  &mdash;  let&rsquo;s steal the census.</p>

		<p>This scenario has been identified as one of the standard tricks played for years by Soros and his lackeys: first, elect a &#8220;friend&#8221; as the secretary of state where GOP has relatively small advantage, and then fix the elections by various means, hoping that the &#8220;friendly&#8221; secretary of state will be unwilling to expose the fraud.</p>
<p>I tell you guys, we are facing thugs that have no ethics. We must get over our moral reservations and fight against the SOBs with all means possible or face the ultimate defeat. I suggest adding to your principles that separating a Democrat from an office is always moral (not that the Republicans are automatically good). And if you can convince Soros and his lackeys to move out that would be even more moral thing to do. </p>
<p>Also, deporting all deportable individuals would take some man power from the Democratic party.<br>

		<p>We are headed for a complete and ongoing one party system of government (the Democrats will control the three branches of government).  This has been in the works since the 1970s.  When that which is in our country illegally is made legal to the tune of about 20 to 30 million individuals the one party system will be consummated.  Many of these ACORN type organizations are controlled and put in place by individuals (i.e., George Soros) who have very little love for European Americans or our country.  Organizations such as ACORN are crooked through and through but they do have an anti-European American agenda and this is how they justify much of their actions; how else could we get an Al Franken in the US Senate.            </p>

<p>The above is a typical example of superficially sound but actually invalid rhetoric that so many Democrats use in their campaign of deceit and fraud.</p>
<p>The agitator that wrote the above forgot to mention that the &#8220;pregnant chads&#8221; and &#8220;hanging chads&#8221; were Gore and not Bush votes, which makes it clear who was the cheating party in Florida 2000 (the Dems were). Here is another quote that explains it well:</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/l5rwwc" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/l5rwwc&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Although many of your ideas posted there seem rational, I propose that a totally different approach to voter fraud is needed.</p>
<p>1. Rather than creating federal data bases etc., any form of voter fraud should be made punishable as treason (if a US citizen committed it) or espionage (if a non-citizen committed it). In particular, anyone convicted of voter fraud should be barred for life from voting in federal, state, and local elections. Prosecutors investigating alleged voter fraud should have a mandate to access all relevant data nationwide. Once the cheaters end up serving lengthy prison terms, virtually no one would risk casting a fraudulent vote.</p>
<p>2. Under the circumstances of roughly half of the eligible voters actually voting, facts from mathematical statistics should be used to determined what constitutes a fraud and what does not. In particular, the voting population should be a fairly random sample of all eligible citizenry (for otherwise the outcome of voting cannot be recognized as the will of the People), and any actions that inject bias to the sample should be unlawful and punishable as voter fraud. So, when ACORN orchestrates &#8220;voting drives&#8221; and the group that they coerced to vote significantly differs from the rest of the voter&rsquo;s population, it should be considered voter fraud and led to stern punishment of ACORN operatives.</p>
<p>3. The border must be rigorously enforced, for once crooks are let into our country there will be only two option available: accept the rampart fraud and cheating as a fact of life or surrender some of your constitutional liberties in order to make fraud prevention possible. Obviously, none of the two is acceptable.<br>

		<p>The farce is over, and the Bolsheviks have won this state away from ANY balanced POV. Bolshevik, you say? How can I be so &#8216;prejudiced&rsquo;? Oh, come now&hellip;</p>
<p>If you have read any history of the state of &#8216;Minnestroika,&rsquo; (the name given it during the era of dying Soviet power, when Raisa Gorbachov visited the &#8216;Siberia of the Midwest&rsquo;) you can see that the Bolsheviks targeted the Union movements from the early 19-teens, and Minnesota was one of the first to believe the lies of Marxism, as &#8216;interpreted&rsquo; by the Bolshies. The MN. Democratic Farm-Labor (DFL) party was, and has been since then, THE &#8216;agent of change&rsquo; (read socialism by degrees) in MN. ever since. </p>
<p>Realize that it was HHH who brought, encouraged, and made us in the &#8216;Upper Midwest&rsquo; to believe that blacks from the Gary, Indiana slums, and the south side of Chicago, would be &#8216;good for Minnesota.&rsquo; Well, my mother saw the light, and got us out of the &#8216;inner city&rsquo; well in advance before the &#8216;Chocolate Horde.&rsquo; Fast forward forty years, and EVERYTHING SHE FEARED, has now come to pass.</p>
<p>Nowadays, North Minneapolis (and the Brooklyn&rsquo;s- Center and Park) is/are THE center of drugs, violence, robbery, knife stabbings, closed malls and shopping areas, etc. in the Seven-County Metro area. It all due to one thing - non-white races coming where they never had been before; being treated differently than their white neighbors, living in government-subsidized housing- whether Section 8, reduced rent, or &#8216;immigrant assistance.&rsquo; With the help of Lutheran Social[ist] Service, the &#8216;social change arm&rsquo; of one of the most liberal Church in the USA (outside of the Episcopal Church) -I speak of the ELCA- the &#8220;Evangelical Lutheran Chruch in America- (who counted Abortionist Tiller as one of their &#8216;communicants&rsquo; before the wrath of God smote him&hellip;), my wife and I have seen the destruction of everything except &#8220;Minnesota Nice&#8221;- that stifling sense of restraint that will not admit there is an elephant in the living room, even when he&rsquo;s defecating on your rug!</p>
<p>This Bolshevism of the DFL and the LSS is the reason MN. has the shame of having the first MUSLIM congressthing, and having a very large horde of Somalis in &#8216;the state formerly known as Little Scandinavia.&rsquo; (Oh, yeah,now that we are lauding &#8216;Black Musicians, let&rsquo;s not forget to mention that Prince is the child of Minnesota liberals, another mixed-raced-or appearing- androgyne, in the vein of the late MJ.)</p>
<p>Franken&rsquo;s spurious &#8216;win&rsquo; is the last in a long, long line of people who loved their state, but who watched as their government, their social services, their way of living, their neighborhoods, and their churches were CONSCIOUSLY liberalised according to the Bolshevik agenda, until to speak sanity is considered the worst &#8216;hate speech&rsquo; liberals can smugly accuse their conservative friends (if they even have any!) without fear of reprimand- why, even Garrison Keillor has been using his radio show of Lake Wobegon as a platform for Republican scapegoating for years! </p>
<p>As we watch Detroit (and other &#8216;multi-racial cities&rsquo; return to nature in the wake of the city&rsquo;s inability to maintain infrastructure, (in what once was the heart of the American Automotive industr) -all of it due to enforced black presence in the North&rsquo;s manufacturing sector- let&rsquo;s just realize that the Obamanation is clearly gathering the apparatchniks, and MN. is merely a piece in the puzzle to ostracize and make impotent the best and brightest of the Caucasians in this state.</p>
<p>This state&rsquo;s potential for wresting itself from the iron grip of the liberals is toast. I&rsquo;m moving somewhere else, where White Men are free to criticize and enjoy the Bill of Rights, before the Obama regime unleashes it&rsquo;s iron fist out of the velvet glove. It may be only a few years, but, by God, I am not going to watch the land of my ancestors go the way of the rest of the nation, once &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo;s rot&rsquo; takes hold.</p>
<p>MN, requiescat in pace. You&rsquo;re gonna need it.</p>

<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s common sense. Donna Braziele, a black woman who ran Al Gore&rsquo;s 2000 Presidential campaign, (who can sometimes be seen on the Sunday morning gab shows), said in late October of 2000 that all Gore needed to do is to get his average poll numbers within the margin of error, and she could &#8220;get five points on the ground.&#8221;  What else could that mean, other than black voter fraud?</p>
<p>As for your other post, your suggestion #1, and any suggestions you might have of prohibiting people to vote, is unworkable without Federal listkeeping.  The reason is that local &#8220;authorities&#8221; in certain places would just overlook the prohibition and register them anyway, and count their votes.</p>

<p>I knew Dr. Driller was not only a member at a Lutheran Church in Wichita, but he was an usher at the church.  I didn&rsquo;t know if it was a MO Synod or an ELCA; thanks for letting me know.  I had my suspicions that it was an ELCA; the MO Synod (which I was baptized in) is far from perfect, but there is no way they would let a driller of holes in baby&rsquo;s skulls become an usher.</p>

<p>Not really. It would suffice to employ a similar mechanism that keeps felons from voting (at least in some cases). I don&rsquo;t see anything unworkable with delegating such power to the courts.</p>
<p>Speaking of common sense, we will surrender little by little all our individual liberties (except, perhaps, the right to child pornography or blasphemy against the Christian religion) to the authorities in order to prevent all kinds of fraud and crime. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the direction that those of us who are attached to the Constitution and the Bill of rights would like to follow. <br>
