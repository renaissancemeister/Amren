			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, July 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oklahoma&rsquo;s bipartisan congressional delegation this week accused the Obama Justice Department of trying to strong-arm the state into rejecting an English-only referendum by saying it could cost Oklahoma federal funding.</p>
<p>In a stern letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., the lawmakers  &mdash;  six Republicans and one Democrat  &mdash;  said Justice officials were meddling in Oklahoma affairs when they issued a pre-emptive April warning letter, well before any potential violation of law would take place.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the Justice Department says Oklahoma lawmakers themselves have already cleared up the problem by changing the referendum in April to remove any conflicts with federal law.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposal appropriately allows languages other than English when required by federal law and, as long as recipients comply with those laws, federal funds are not at risk,&#8221; said Justice spokesman Alejandro Miyar.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma Legislature voted in April to ask state voters next year to vote on requiring official state actions be conducted in English and preventing individuals from suing to have state services provided in languages other than English.</p>
<p>In her April warning letter, Loretta King, the acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, said limiting services could amount to discrimination against persons based on their national origin. She said state programs could lose federal subsidies if they run afoul of discrimination laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, the Oklahoma lawmakers, led by Republican Sen. James M. Inhofe, said that by acting even before lawmakers had passed their measure, much less before voters had approved the referendum, the administration was acting outside of the civil rights rules the Supreme Court laid out in a 2001 ruling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawmakers questioned why Oklahoma received a warning when other states have similar language requirements. State Rep. Randy Terrill, a Republican and sponsor of the referendum, said the letter was an effort to &#8220;blackmail&#8221; the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DOJ&rsquo;s argument is legally unsound and tries to equate English-language laws with national-origin discrimination. No court in the country has ever issued a ruling that supports the DOJ&rsquo;s specious legal claims,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Justice Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations has sent letters to state courts warning against dropping specific translation services.<br>

		<p>The reason Oklahoma got the warning and other states did not is because Oklahoma was the reddest state in 2008.  It&rsquo;s not like Obama has a chance to win it in 2012.  </p>

		<p>In the comments section at the original article somebody said that Oklahoma was the only state in the union in which Obama did not carry a single county in the 2008 election. If that&rsquo;s true, then it goes a long way to explaining this situation.</p>

		<p>The name Loretta  King, Asst. AG,  keeps coming up in controversial  situations.   Apparently she played a major role in dismissing the lawsuit against the New Black Panthers for outrageous voter intimidation.  The dismissal happened despite the fact that the AG&rsquo;s had already won the lawsuit by default.<br>
When Congressman Frank Wolfe attempted to question AG King for the reasons for the dismissal, she stated that such information is privileged.  </p>

		<p>What I could never understand is the idea that it is wrong to discriminate on the basis of national origin?  Why shouldn&rsquo;t we be allowed to discriminate in favor of our own countrymen?  Should our own come first?  The foreigner can leave, where can we go?</p>

		<p>Oklahoma should tell the feds to take a long walk down a short pier. If they cut off funding, let them. Legislators will likely discover the cost of complying with federal mandates nearly equals   &mdash;   if not exceeds   &mdash;   the money received.</p>
<p>Back in 1999 Walter Williams applauded Louisiana for enacting a state sovereignty resolution, and outlined how any state could put teeth into such a measure   &mdash;   namely, a federal tax escrow law. All federal taxes, tariffs, etc. would go into escrow and the state would periodically remit the money to Washington. If the feds threaten a funding reduction or cutoff of any kind, the state would simply withhold from the next escrow payment however much money was needed to recover the shortfall. Not long after, the League of the South wrote a draft for such a law. All a legislature has to do is fill in the blanks. I still have both the column and the draft bill in PDF format; anyone interested in reading them can e-mail me.</p>

		<p>I think this Eric Holder character, as new Attorney General, is real bad news!</p>
<p>I mean, a black lawyer who quite possibly owes his carreer to affirmative action (like Barack Obama himself), who could be a reverse racist, at the very top of the structure of an organisation as important (and powerful) as the Department of Justice&hellip; Bad news!</p>
<p>Man! For the last few months, the news have been full of reverse racists. I mean, in addition to His Highness, the Prince of America, Obama himself, there&rsquo;s been Sotomayor, «Skip» Gates, Pastor Wright, Janet Murguia (of La Raza), and now this Holder character!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seriously worried about what our place will be, in this new society those reverse racists are building for themselves&hellip; Building it, with the help of one particular minority, the name of whom cannot be said publicly, for fear of being sued for the new crime of «hate speech»&hellip; or is it hate thought?!?</p>

		<p>After reading the original article, I did look up voting information for 2008. Oklahoma is the only state where every county voted for McCain.  </p>
<p>Also on the original article, some of the commentors suggest that Oklahoma is bigoted and intolerant (big supprise) and that Oklahomans are ignorant rednecks who can barely speak English themselves (so who&rsquo;s being bigoted and intolerant?)</p>
<p>I grew up in Oklahoma. My parents and siblings still live there. If there is going to be a pro-White revolution, I think Oklahoma will lead the way. Aside from some areas of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and the historical black college Langston, the state is very white, very conservative, very pro-gun, and very ready to end the anti-White nonsense we&rsquo;ve been subjected to for the past 30+ years.</p>

		<p>Another nail in the coffin of this once-great country. With Washington determined to make this a multi-cultural, multi-language, multi-everything, we&rsquo;ll be just another third world teeming with hoards of people from every corner of the world.

		<p>As a Canadian I can only warn Americans that there is NOTHING good about bilingualism or multilingualism. The USA should be doing everything in its power to support the English langauge, just like Mexico does all it can to help Spanish. You guys are heading down a linguistic wasteland road to nowhere. Trust me on this. If the Spanish language takes root - really takes root - in America you will be very sorry.</p>
