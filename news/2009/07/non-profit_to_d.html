			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yvonne Wingett, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), July 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon is bringing a representative from the Southern Poverty Law Center to help raise awareness about the presence of the state&rsquo;s hate groups, the Nativist movement and White-supremacist organizations.</p>
<p>The Montgomery, Ala.-based non-profit organization <a href="/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.html#splc" target="splc_does_not_check_for_accuracy">identifies, monitors and investigates</a> hate activity across the United States.</p>
<p>According to the center, the number of hate groups nationwide has risen 54 percent since 2000, fueled by opposition to non-White immigration, the economic recession and the election of the nation&rsquo;s first Black president.</p>
<p>Heidi Beirich, the center&rsquo;s director of research, will meet with law-enforcement officials and the media Aug. 12-14.</p>
<p>The mayor also is planning some type of public forum to discuss hate groups, especially anti-immigration extremists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;With the Internet, these groups are able to give themselves their own label of &#8216;patriots,&rsquo; or &#8216;community activists,&rsquo;&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;And even the media has picked up on that and is using that label for the groups. The groups we&rsquo;re talking about are not community activists or patriots.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trip has been in the works since last spring with the release of the center&rsquo;s report, &#8220;The Year In Hate.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>The center defines hate groups as those that have &#8220;beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s just one more incident which reveal this mayor as a left wing fool who is too ignorant to know he&rsquo;s beinh used by this radical group to futher their agenda of open borders in their quest to destroy America&rsquo;s white power structure.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a disgrace to his state.  That such a conservative state could vote for the radical leftist Janel Napolitano for governor and this mayor is living proof that white people, as a group, are naive and ignorant of what is going on in the country today.</p>
<p>Naïveté and ignorance are the two most important factors that must be present in order to allow totalitarians and demagogues to gain power.</p>

		<p>People like Phil Gordon are nothing more than part of the many canaries in the coal mine, where any danger to the U.S. from continued massive immigration from Mexico is concerned. He has been outrageous on illegal immigration issues. Another brave U.S. border patrol agent was murdered a few days ago, but these things apparently don&rsquo;t phase people like Phil Gordon.</p>
<p>I should add that Gordons even being allowed to stay in office, rather than having already been recalled is also an indication  that the mine is going to explode unless Americans start recalling these people whenever they start exhibiting their traitorous tendencies.</p>

<p>- Immutable characteristics? I never knew someones citizenship status was immutable. I always thought one could change their citizenship status if they so desired. Stupid me.</p>

<p>Many Americans are completely unaware of the SPLC and ADL backdoor relationship with the police at local, state, and federal levels. These groups pay off the politicians who in turn give the groups access to police intelligence. That&rsquo;s right! Law enforcement paid for by your tax dollars, essentially is rented out to private &#8220;watchdog&#8221; groups to spy on citizens that &#8220;special interest&#8221; groups and Hostile Elites fear and despise. It is a violation of citizens 1st amendment free speech rights and 4th amendment privacy rights. The media, of course, don&rsquo;t tell the public anything about this. Some free country we live in. </p>

		<p>The first time I&rsquo;d heard of the SPLC I formed an impression of it as a weird fringe group squawking from the sidelines.  I still hold that view.</p>
<p>It amazes me that they are quoted in mainstream media and courted by elected office holders.  I will not hesitate to upbraid anyone who gives them any credibility.</p>

		<p>#6, feller says, How much is Morris D charging?</p>
<p>That question just struck me as extremely funny. That must always be the first question with the SPLC, and must be why they&rsquo;re so rich. The &#8220;civil rights&#8221; bonanza, another very profitable racket. I belive it is a racket, because Dee&rsquo;s and company,have expanded into areas that have nothing to do with American immigration law or civil rights. I&rsquo;m surprised he hasn&rsquo;t created a franchise. It makes me feel sorry for all of the people in the U.S. who actually work for a living.</p>

		<p>Mark Krikorian, executive director, Center for Immigration Studies, Washington, D. C:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across the West we see efforts to restrict free expression of political ideas related to immigration &hellip; The most recent salvo on this side of the ocean is a report released last week by the Southern Poverty Law Center tarring the three leading groups working to limit immigration &mdash; including my own Center for Immigration Studies &mdash; as part of a racist conspiracy, supposedly orchestrated by a retired eye doctor in Michigan named John Tanton. The fact that they went after mainstream groups rather than fringe ones shows that the goal is not elevating the tone of public discourse but shutting it down altogether. Perhaps a more honest title for the report would have been &lsquo;The Protocols of the Elders of Restrictionism.&rsquo;&rdquo;*</p>
<p>*Free Speech Is Great, But &hellip;The open-borders lobby&rsquo;s attempts to silence its critics.<br/>

		<p>Wonder when La Raza and the other immigrant groups will try to muzzle the press? We had a story airing locally, that in San Antonio, a Mexican female, Oty Sanchez, murdered her infant, mutilated the body and even ate part of the decapitated child&rsquo;s brain. But that&rsquo;s no problem. Aztec and Mayan ancestors of today&rsquo;s Mestizos did basically the same thing on their vaunted pyramids. After murdering their sacrificial victims.</p>

		<p>It all depends on one&rsquo;s definition of hate, doesn&rsquo;t it? If the SPLC designates the Boy Scouts of America a Hate Group because they don&rsquo;t allow homosexual scoutmasters, then by golly it&rsquo;s a Hate Group.<br/>
We have to learn to define our own terms. Just remember what the great Arizonian Barry Goldwater said in 1964, &ldquo;Extremism in the name of Liberty is no vice…moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue&rdquo;. </p>

<p>Lol, you mean like groups who think of white Christians as knuckle-dragging peasants forever one hair&rsquo;s breadth away from becoming Nazi goons?  The type who form organizations like the SPLC and the NAACP?  The kind that demonize and attack white Christians like they&rsquo;re national pasttimes?  Those kinds of malign beliefs and practices?</p>
<p>Immutable characteristics indeed; projection is a classic error and the left is especially prone.</p>
