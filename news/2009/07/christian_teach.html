			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luke Salkeld and Laura Clark, Daily Mail (London), July 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A teacher claims he has been sacked for reprimanding pupils who made racist remarks about his being a Christian.</p>
<p>Nicholas Kafouris said he lost his Â£30,000-a-year post because he would not tolerate the &#8216;openly racist&rsquo; behaviour of pupils as young as eight.</p>
<p>He said the predominantly Muslim youngsters openly praised Islamic extremists in class, and hailed the September 11 terrorists as &#8216;heroes and martyrs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Greek-born Mr Kafouris, 40, taught for more than ten years at Bigland Green Primary in Tower Hamlets, East London, where according to the most recent Ofsted report &#8216;almost all&rsquo; the 465 pupils are from ethnic minorities and a vast proportion do not speak English as a first language.</p>
<p>He is taking the school, its headmistress and assistant head to an employment tribunal where he will claim he was forced out after highlighting the rise in racism among pupils.</p>
<p>In 2006, said Mr Kafouris, he brushed against a boy while giving him a book.</p>
<p>&#8216;He said rather brusquely to me, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t touch me, you&rsquo;re a Christian&#8221;. I found this very offensive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Later that year, he said children aged eight and nine in his class praised the suicide bombers in the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>&#8216;In late November and December 2006, many various unacceptable and openly racist, anti-Semitic and anti-Christian remarks were being made by many and various children in Year 4,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;These included, &#8220;We want to be Islamic bombers when we grow up&#8221;, &#8220;the Twin Towers bombers are heroes and martyrs&#8221;, &#8220;we hate the Jews&#8221; and &#8220;we hate the Christians&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And in January 2007, he claims some pupils &#8216;expressed delight&rsquo; that a child had died when a wall collapsed on him in London.</p>
<p>When asked why, he said one of the children replied: &#8216;Because he&rsquo;s English.&rsquo; The following month, during a religious education lesson about Jonah and the whale, he claims one of the pupils asked if Jonah was a Jew, before shouting: &#8216;I hate the Jews, they&rsquo;re our enemies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Kafouris says he completed &#8216;Racist Incident Reporting Sheets&rsquo; and notified headmistress Jill Hankey in writing about each incident.</p>
<p>But he claims his concerns were ignored because she wanted to maintain the school&rsquo;s &#8216;good&rsquo; Ofsted rating.</p>
<p>Mr Kafouris, who is unmarried and has no children, was also reprimanded for handling a discussion about religion with a child &#8216;inappropriately&rsquo;, which he denies.</p>
<p>He says assistant head Margaret Coleman accused him of shouting at pupils and telling them Muslims had produced suicide bombers  &mdash;  claims he rejects.</p>
<p>&#8216;I believe after I complained to the head about the racist and religious discrimination incidents, I suffered victimisation,&rsquo; he says.</p>
<p>&#8216;I also suffered less favourable treatment and incurred harassment by the head and assistant head.</p>
<p>&#8216;The two people above created an intimidating, hostile, degrading, threatening, humiliating and offensive environment for me at my work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Kafouris says the way he was treated brought on stress and depression, and that he was forced to take time off work. He was finally dismissed because of his absence, on April 30 this year.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council, on behalf of the school, said: &#8216;The governing body stands by its decision and we believe all the correct procedures were followed.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>I posted my response to this story on the dailymail website last week.  Of course it ignored.  I simply stated that there will be open warfare on the streets of Britain within the next decade thanks to the endless immigration of non native people who&rsquo;s culture is so diametrically opposed to western civilization.  Evidently this was deemed to racially hostile for them to print.  Hope they don&rsquo;t try to extradite me for thought crimes, because as we have seen this tin pot republic government won&rsquo;t stand in their way.</p>

		<p>Muslims from the Middle East are the most racist people on Earth as far as I am concerned. As I have mentioned before I am a former Muslim and I know how I as a White American was treated by the Middle Easterners. Blacks are the low people on the Islamic totem pole although there have been movements to try to bring blacks back to Islam as it was thought to have been their original religion. This is just a ploy to use the innate lower intellegence and aggression of black men to be the foot soldiers of Islam. I have been called horrendous names by the Muslim children, some of them no more than 5-6 and I am sure that this poor teacher is totally correct in what he has experianced. </p>

 <br>
This same boy will grow up to seek out every available opportunity to &#8220;touch&#8221; Christians: raping, beating, stabbing. To see this malignancy, this self-destruction, overwhelming England is so disturbing, it&rsquo;s almost unbelievable. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s anything new to the mindset of the British elite. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, or why, but they seem to absolutely hate their own people of the lower socio-economic classes: the working-class people. This must have been a major impetus for the fleeing of British people to the American colonies, to escape a very deep hatred by their own overlords. I&rsquo;m reading a book on the settling of Australia and it is truly shocking how much the British lower (&#8220;criminal&#8221;) classes were despised by the upper crust. I said &#8220;criminal&#8221; because of the pervasive attitude of the elite to view every under-class Brit as a criminal, or potential criminal. It was mind-boggling how many petty things a person could be charged with and sent into exile to Australia. The lower class was viewed as complete riff-raff, and the lords stopped at nothing to send as many of them as possible into exile in the land-down-under. Today their strategy is different: you don&rsquo;t send your countrymen away to a foreign land, YOU BRING THE FOREIGNERS TO YOUR COUNTRYMEN. Destroy the lower classes from within. Almost daily we see articles here on AmRen on the destruction of Britain, but we never get to the bottom of - Why? Why the hatred of their own people? Why, where, when did this start? Did it start in Roman times? Saxon times? Norman, Viking times? How did this schism develop between the elites and the rest of the people? I&rsquo;m wondering, if you go back far enough, if the people comprising the upper crust are of a completely different ethnicity and even sub-racial stock than the have-nots below. Maybe that accounts for their almost genetic hatred for the working class. I don&rsquo;t know enough about British history to answer my own questions. I just have a feeling the that hatred by the elite for the lower classes has been going on a very long time, and has just begun to turn deadly serious in modern times. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just thinking too hard. Maybe there is no reason for this insanity.  Anyone know of any good books on this subject?</p>

<p>If he were non-white or non-Christian, he would have this case sewed up.  He should be anticipating a hefty settlement that would allow him to retire in comfort for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>But being on the &#8220;wrong side&#8221; of the fence, racially,  his case is shakey, at best.    I say &#8220;good luck&#8221;,  because he&rsquo;ll need it.<br>

		<p>The English are paying heavily for their &#8220;generosity&#8221; to &#8220;immigrants.&#8221; It really is a sad state of affairs when a government that is supposed to protect its people allows the creation of a society within a society, one bent on clear domination if not destruction of its host.  If they were smart in England, they would quickly rid themselves of all Muslims that refuse to pledge an allegiance to England first, Islam second. This teacher is just the beginning, wait until Islam grows even stronger in Engalnd&hellip;can anyone say &#8216;violent civil war?&#8221;  What are the options when ones government basically allows a non-military invasion and takeover of one&rsquo;s homelan? Can anyone seriously see any Muslim government allowing such a situation to develop inside its country?  I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip;</p>

		<p>The English are getting exactly what they deserve. They invited hundreds of thousands of Muslims into their country, and now they&rsquo;re &#8220;shocked and appalled&#8221; that they are acting like Muslims. Why should the Muslims have anything but contempt for a people that are giving away their homeland. The English are contemptable. So are white Americans for the same reason.</p>

		<p>I hate to say it but most White people need a hard dose of reality to wake them up.  Many more White people are going to be casualties of multiculturalism before a large percentage of Whites wake up.  This is tragic but probably necessary.  Some Whites are so blinded that no matter what happens they&rsquo;ll still believe in their illusions.  I think we can take heart in the fact that it&rsquo;s not our fault.  Any people subjected to 24/7 conditioning the way we have for at least the last 60 years would be deluded and carrying a guilt complex.</p>

		<p>I am a US-American &amp; have lived in Germany for 15 years.</p>
<p>Everyone I speak to here is horrified by the Islamization of Europe, &amp; realizes that they can never be assimilated in large numbers</p>
<p>(A small number are very well assimilated, the intelligent ones who love European civilization &amp; are in ectsay over having escaped the mindnumbing stupidity of the Ismlamic world. Some of these get assasinated by their psychotic brethren. There have been 50 &#8220;honor killings&#8221; of women in Germany sibce I arrived) </p>
<p>It is just the polcymakers and the media &amp; the crazy left that keeps repeating the robotic mantras. </p>
<p>Many Euros are ready for open insurrection, so the real issue is:</p>
<p>can ENOUGH white people get in touch with their instincts for self-preservation, or have they been too numbed by prozac, brainwashing, consumerism, and sheer conformism??</p>
<p>When whites decide they WANT to survive, the problems will solve themsleves: <br>
euros will elect governments that end immigration, stop subsidizing high birth rates among the invaders, send as many home as posible, and pubich crimes by immigrants with more than a slap on the wrist. </p>
<p>actually, Americans are much more complacent about their invaders (most of whom who are at least christian, do not CELEBRATE 9/11 as a HOLY DAY like most euro muslims - I&rsquo;m NOT kidding!!), have more confidence in multiculti than Euros do. </p>

<p>Despite propaganda to the contrary, sustaining a myth that the English have always been a multiracial, multicultural, mongrel nation, the fact is that the basic stock of the indigenous English is Anglo-Saxon, with an admixture of the very closely related Vikings.</p>
<p>The Norman Conquest of 1066 brought in a small ruling elite, who although quite closely related to the indigenous English ethnically (being a mixture of Norse and Frankish - both Germanic peoples) were distinct culturally and linguistically. This distinction (between the Anglo-Saxon masses and the Norman elites) has remained in place to this day, but it has latterly been overlaid by the &#8220;long march through the institutions&#8221; in the postwar period of sociocultural Marxists, who despise all of the indigenous peoples of Europe and their historically-, culturally-, linguistically- and ethnically-defined nation-states as obstacles in the way of the creation of a global, multicultural, multiracial utopia.</p>

		<p>This ghastly area of Wower Hamlets is mainly Bengali. Bengali tribal elders control politics and all teachers in such areas treat them with exaggerated and submissive respect.</p>
<p>In this part of London, public money is spent on Islamist group who churn out demented religious hatred 7 days a week [all good Islamists live on the bounty of the Welfare State, of course.]</p>
<p>If you are brave enough, go to the SOCIALIST UNITY website and also the RESPECT website for an idea of the utter horror mass immigation has inflicted on this part of East London.</p>
<p>Tower Hamlets is a thoroughfare of sorts; Flemings and Jews passed through here but few white people choose to live here. In any case, publicly-owned housing is allocated by local government officers who understand very well the desires of their Bengali political overlords.</p>

The native British have remained more or less unchanged for the last 12,000 years<br>
https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0719_050719_britishgene.html</p>
<p>Despite invasions by Saxons, Romans, Vikings, Normans, and others, the genetic makeup of today&rsquo;s white Britons is much the same as it was 12,000 ago, a new book claims. </p>
<p>In The Tribes of Britain, archaeologist David Miles says around 80 percent of the genetic characteristics of most white Britons have been passed down from a few thousand Ice Age hunters&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s been a lot of arguing over the last ten years, but it&rsquo;s now more or less agreed that about 80 percent of Britons&rsquo; genes come from hunter-gatherers who came in immediately after the Ice Age,&#8221; Miles said. </p>
<p><br>
So much for the leftish rubbish of Britain being a land of immigrants and multiculturalism. Indeed BRITAIN INCLUDING IRELAND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LANDS OF EMIGRATION.</p>

<p>One wonders why Mr Kafouris marital status was inserted into this MSM piece. Are they implying that, since he has no children, he has no understanding of how to handle them? This strikes me as a subtle attempt to discredit him. If he were gay that fact would most certainly NOT have been used in such a manner by the MSM.</p>

<p>Your statement begs this response: Although less extreme, many Christians are brought up to hate Jews and Muslims and non-Christian (as Protestants often think of Catholics, or Catholics often think of Protestants)- add Buhddists, Hindus, and any other non-Christian faith to the list.  Therefore it is impossible, ultimately, for anyone to live with Christians, except Christians.  It was only 3-400 years ago that European Christians underwent what conservative often deride as the start of communist thought - The Enlightenment.  But that is how the U.S. came to be and what has allowed the West to advance beyond the remaining peoples, with their fanatical religions. I can imagine the West returning to frank Barbarism as Germany did for 12 years in the 20th century - to its ruin.  Don&rsquo;t forget what Hitler and his Nazis did to Germany as they grew more fanatical.  And don&rsquo;t blame it on paganism - the proofs are there and books have been written about the involvement and influence of Christianity on Nazism and it fruits.</p>
<p>I am always arguing for a fresh vision of a White future.  I think it is neccessary if there is going to be any real intention beyond endless complaining among Whites.</p>

Sonya is right. In Europe they are continually confusing religion with race, as if there is no recognizable difference   &mdash;   even in the courts.  But nonetheless, it all boils down to bigotry either way.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Are they implying that, since he has no children, he has no understanding of how to handle them? This strikes me as a subtle attempt to discredit him. If he were gay that fact would most certainly NOT have been used in such a manner by the MSM.&#8221;<br>

To the contrary, though it was oddly worded, I definitely took it as an oblique attempt to imply EXACTLY that, in order to discredit the merit of his case and undermine his credibility!</p>
<p>Unprincipled though it seems, the media are by no means adverse to using such a strategy. Although they have relented, only in recent years, on matters of sexual orientation, not that much has really changed. In the carefully  hierarchical world of political correctness, when it comes to choosing priorities, Islam and color ALWAYS trump sex or orientation   &mdash;   especially if the grievant is white. That&rsquo;s why black rapists (of white women) attract no special outrage or even attention   &mdash;   whereas if the rapist were white, the whole world would be reading about it with shock and horror.<br>

<p>One has to realize that one&rsquo;s race IS one&rsquo;s religion.</p>
<p>What I mean is, that the mantra Hilaire Belloc once wrote- &#8220;Europe is the Faith; the Faith, Europe&#8221;.</p>
<p>Christianity has been (in the more aware past) called &#8216;the White Man&rsquo;s Religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All of these things point to the fact taht, until the rise of Caesaro-papalism in the 12th century, Christendom and Christianity were co-terminious- beyond the Bosporus or the Straits of Gibraltar, the Christian populace stopped, as did Western civilization.</p>
<p>All that has occurred since then is a religious, as well as a racial, aberration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to restore the Faith as Folk, once again, and return &#8216;ad fontes&rsquo; to the &#8216;bound of our habitations,&rsquo; as St. Paul states.</p>

<p>These creation myths about the &#8220;British&#8221; have been doing the rounds for some time now, and have been eagerly seized upon by the BNP (whom I otherwise broadly support).</p>
<p>Actually, what they really do is WEAKEN the territorial claim of the English (as opposed to the Celts) to England. As far as I am concerned, however, 1500 years is quite long enough to establish the Anglo-Saxon ownership of England; I do not have to rely on highly contentious genetic pseudoscience claiming that (certain of) my ancestors have occupied Britain since the last ice age.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, or why, but they seem to absolutely hate their own people of the lower socio-economic classes: the working-class people. This must have been a major impetus for the fleeing of British people to the American colonies, to escape a very deep hatred by their own overlords. &hellip;. The lower class was viewed as complete riff-raff, and the lords stopped at nothing to send as many of them as possible into exile in the land-down-under.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely true.  33 years ago my sister married an Englishman who inherited his Father&rsquo;s title, the lowest of all titles, Baronet. In addtion to being landed gentry, the family is very sympathetic to communism, in fact her father in law, the deceased Baronet was heavily involved in the Cambridge communist ring that produced McLean, Burgess, Philby, Anthony Blunt etc.</p>
<p>Yet this leftist communist upper class family absolutely detests working class people.  They look down on even nurses, school teachers and other professionals.  Small business owners are considered absolute trash.  My sister worked for several summers as a waitress while in college.  They sneered at her for years about it.  Her husband, the present ultra leftist Baronet who still admires soviet russia throughly despises the working classes.</p>
<p>Read some of the Agatha Christie type popular fiction of 1900 to about 1940.  There are many mentions of the upper class attitude towards children killed in car accidents.  The attitude was that the working classes should keep their unruly children out of the streets so the upper classes could speed through the main street and residential areas without being held responsible for killing working class trash children.</p>
<p>Then there is of course the horrors of the early industrial revolution when 5 year old orphans were sold to factory owners as the cheapest of labor.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Of course, all over Europe   &mdash;   Spain, Italy, Russia   &mdash;   this was true, not just in Britain.</p>
<p>Aristocrats have always liked to distance themselves from the toiling classes, on whose labor they live,  believing that centuries of in-breeding had made them a genetically distinct group, superior to the hoi polloi. </p>
<p>In the British case, they had the further excuse of claiming Norman ancestry, thus separating themselves from their conquered Anglo-Saxon serfs.</p>
<p>Several months ago, here [in response to a question why  the British royal family seems so unconcerned about the present race-replacement],  somebody stated that  &#8220;royalty&#8221;  has always held itself apart as distinct group   &mdash;   considering itself  <i>virtually another race from the people it rules.</i>  I had never heard that before, but I found it fascinating.  It certainly makes sense, and it ties in with a lot of other things. </p>
<p>In Poland, for instance (so I have read), the nobility held itself apart, believing that it was descended from some vague, mythological conquerors that came from out of the East in the dim past. They evidently did not consider themselves to be Slavs and thus felt nothing in common with the Polish peasants whom they ruled, although there are no historical facts to back up this notion.  They too, like the British upper class, considered themselves a completely separate group, distinct from the rest    &mdash;   at least in their own minds.  In Spain, the upper class still considered itself Gothic, and in France (until the revolution at least) as Franks   &mdash;   even though it was many, many centuries since real Franks and Visigoths ruled, and their blood must have become very attenuated after all that time.  And, after a thousand years, the same with the Normans in the British Isles. </p>
<p>I recall reading somewhere the  amusing comment made by a British aristocrat to a guest. They were at his manorial estate overlooking a valley containing a large city.  He casually remarked, gesturing over the countryside, &#8220;There&rsquo;s nobody else around here but us. We&rsquo;re the only ones left&#8221;&hellip;  (referring to other aristocrats, obviously),  ignoring the fact that below them lay a city of half a million people!  To him, those people did not exist. They  were &#8220;nobody&#8221;.<br>

		<p>To Anonymous #29: Thanks for the tidbit on your family. I just confirms my belief that the overlords have a rabid hatred for the underlings. Johnny English #17 alluded to the Norman Conquest bringing in a ruling elite that persists to this day. Maybe this is the answer I&rsquo;ve been seeking. Those Normans must have been real SOB&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll have to look them up.  </p>

		<p>To ghw: So the British lords think of themselves as essentially another race of people apart from the rest. This is the clearest possible explanation yet as to why they allow this destruction. They no doubt actually enjoy watching the carnage. It&rsquo;s like throwing the Christians to the lions. Blood sport. This is a graphic warning what is in store for us (in the U.S.) if we let an alien people overtake us. </p>

<p>Want a real eye opener! go look closely at the relationships of the warring countries&rsquo; rulers involved in early European wars,  and to AT LEAST WWI. One will then understand &#8220;inbreeding&#8221;</p>
