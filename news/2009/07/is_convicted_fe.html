			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner, July 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After leaving the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, KA, Michael Vick started a construction job paying $10 an hour, fulfilling the work requirement of his release. Apparently, that introduction to hard work was too much for the former NFL quarterback, as he began working at the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of the Virginia Peninsula, this week.</p>
<p>Amazingly, the same man who was convicted of torturing and brutally killing dozens of dogs is spending the summer working with children!</p>
<p>Boys and Girls Club CEO Steven S. Kast told reporters: &#8220;Because we think there is an opportunity for our children to learn lessons from his experiences, we have chosen to support Michael in his efforts to make amends. To this end, he will be working with children in some of our Clubs on health and fitness activities in the coming weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Vick is a convicted felon, and displayed an incredibly brutal and callous nature, the club&rsquo;s more than 5,000 children will now have contact with this man who is still under house arrest.</p>
<p>Kast said of Vick: &#8220;We were disappointed by some of his recent actions and decisions, but believe he has learned from these experiences and is now conscious of his obligations and responsibilities as a prominent sports figure that impacts and influences our kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reporter&rsquo;s note: When I was in my early 20&rsquo;s, I worked as a volunteer coach for an inner city football team. In order to do this, I had to undergo a background investigation, the first thing I was asked by the club&rsquo;s director was whether or not I had any felony or misdemeanor convictions. Any such conviction would have been an automatic disqualification.</p>
<p>People with felony convictions must ordinarily have a job as a condition of their early release, as well as their parole. Felons are very limited in the jobs they can do and most often consist of manual labor. Any job where daily exposure to children is part of the felon&rsquo;s duties, would simply never happen for most convicts.</p>
<p>Of course, Vick is not most convicts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obviously, Vick is receiving preferential treatment because of his celebrity status. However, that is not the most outrageous aspect to this story.</p>
<p>Michael Vick is idolized by poor, young black boys (which is primarily with whom Vick will be working), who see a trip to the NFL or the NBA as their only way out of poverty. Unfortunately, all too many of those same kids see a prison sentence as a badge of honor. For them, Vick&rsquo;s lawless actions may only serve as further encouragement down a road which leads then to prison.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vick knows that much of the public hates him for what he has done, as the mountain of evidence against him showed him to be a monster. The image of him tossing a football to smiling kids could help change folks&rsquo; opinion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Or at least that&rsquo;s what Team Vick hopes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Would you want your child spending the summer with someone who spent years torturing and drowning dogs?<br>

		<p>Vic&rsquo;s now working with children?</p>
<p>Well, this has become the standard operating procedure to prove to the American public, what good guys rich criminals in the U.S., and/or, politicians, really are. Examples would be, Wall Street Criminals like Mike Milken teaching kids math in Los Angeles and dancing with overweight, unpopular girls, Ivan Boskey, handing out religious phamphlets, crooked politicians(there&rsquo;s too many to name)doing a little community service, etc. Everything involving any real sincerety or repentance in the U.S. is just an illusion, just a game.</p>

		<p>To &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221;: Maybe now people will have a better understanding why I don&rsquo;t watch any &#8220;Professional Sports&#8221;, other than Hockey, which is still White. That, and Professional Billards Championships. </p>
<p>I will not pay to see some Black Ghetto Gangster runnning up and down a field for 40 million dollars. Let some other guy pay that Bastard&rsquo;s salary, because it won&rsquo;t be me. </p>
<p>Honestly, Michael Vick should have been horse whipped in Public, for his crime of animal cruelty, and slaughter, as well as Dog Fighting. I believe that 100 lashes would do the trick, and impart on other Blacks and Hispanics, young and old, alike, that this will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>I agree. He is a role model for those kids and they will be encouraged to follow in his footsteps. 99% of blacks have no feelings for animals as it is; putting this this sadist on display to be admired by those youths is likely to put future dogs at risk.</p>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is why Vick is suspended perhaps forever, and St. Louis&rsquo;s own Leonard Little only got a few games suspension after having driven drunk and killed a white woman in the process.  Are the lives of dogs worth that much more than that of a white woman?</p>
<p>The difference might be is that the current commissioner, Roger Goodell (his father filled out the rest of RFK&rsquo;s Senate term after RFK was a&rsquo;nated), has been far tougher on player transgressions than his predecessor, Paul Tagliabue.  Little&rsquo;s suspension was handed down by T., Goodell has at least suspended Donte Stallworth (drove drunk and killed a Hispanic man in Miami) indefinitely.</p>

		<p>Michael Vick is on his way to his destiny with living on the streets. He&rsquo;s got no way to earn money other than football and in the end, he&rsquo;ll be in the gutter drinking cheap wine talking to another bum, like himself, sitting alongside him about, [back in the day]. I&rsquo;d say this will come to pass within 5-6 yrs.</p>

He&rsquo;ll latch on to some football job (coaching, analyst, commentator, etc.) given to him by a &#8220;brother&#8221; based on their common disdain for &#8220;the man&#8221; and his bigoted laws against such tickey-tack offenses such as murder, armed robbery, blatant animal abuse, vehicular homicide and sexual assault.

<p>Maybe it didn&rsquo;t occur to Steven S. Kast (&#8220;Kast&#8221;?) that Michael Vick&rsquo;s lesson for children is: If you behave as Vick did, you get punished. </p>
<p>Vick should be an object lesson, not a mentor.<br>

<p>If you think the guy that killed the white woman should face a harsher punishment then FINE, but why do you feel the need to mock what those helpless animals went through at the hands of truly sadistic monster that enjoyed watching them suffer and die? Does mocking cruelty towards animals somehow increase the value of human life? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Vick should have gotten 20 years (or death) in my opinion. That has NOTHING to do with an unrelated drunk driving case.</p>

<p>I think the children will be o.k. around him, unless this group includes girls who are over the age of puberty then they will be subject to his scamming in an attempt to get sex.  It&rsquo;s definitely animals that this evil man is a danger to. </p>
<p>Third world peoples everywhere, and black Africans especially, have an inborn callousness against the welfare of all animals and a very large percentage of them have no compassion whatsoever for the welfare of any kind of animal, but especially little dogs and cats.  They&rsquo;re not about to change after thousands of years of abuse, so a children&rsquo;s program or anything just isn&rsquo;t going to change this man&rsquo;s propensity for animal cruelty.</p>
<p>I seriously doubt that years of psychotherapy would be effective either.  It just isn&rsquo;t possible to change people&rsquo;s basic instincts.  The threat of punishment is the only thing that works, and as we know it only works in some cases.</p>

		<p>In comparing Vick&rsquo;s suspension with Littles&rsquo; I would point out the issue of INTENT. Vick DIDN&rsquo;T accidentally kill those dogs (say he was driving his car - not speeding - and an unleashed dog suddenly just bolted right across his path with no time to react, slow down or stop) he deliberately and very cruelly killed them. INTENT is the difference. Little (so far as I know) didn&rsquo;t INTEND to kill that women. That doesn&rsquo;t eliminate his responsibility of course, but it makes a difference. </p>

		<p>I just got finished reading the diary of a black man (William Johnson, Natchez) who lived prior to the civil war in Mississippi. He was a barber by trade, money lender, farmer, property owner, entrepreneur, slave owner, and all around good citizen for his time. </p>
<p>Interestingly, one of the things he was constantly flogging his slaves about was mistreating animals.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m sympathetic to dogs, whites are who I protect.  Vic should get treated much lighter than Bernie Ebbers, Ken Lay (who I doubt is dead), and Jeff Skilling, etc.  Then add all the traitors at the top of every American corporation that pushes or has pushed diversity.  Wind it all up with all the Marxists, media and entertainment biggies, and all the corrupt politicians in this country (98%).  Each and every one of these scoundrels should get the electric chair.

		<p>He should have told the judge that dog-fighting was part of his rich African heritage.<br>
I know the Hindus have some laws regarding animals and Buddhists are supposed to &#8220;do no harm&#8221; to living things, but is compassion towards animals a widespread sentiment outside of the US, Canada and Europe? I doubt it. Most 3rd-worlders would laugh hysterically at the notion that animals have &#8220;rights.&#8221; <br>
PETA and most animal rights groups go way to far but I think most readers here agree that while qualitatively different from the Rights of Man, there is a right and a wrong way to treat animals. We Americans are sentimental about our dogs though, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong in my opinion with enforcing laws against abuse. <br>
Furthermore, people who take pleasure in the abuse of animals very easily go on to take pleasure in the abuse of people, Especially for less intelligent more sociopathic groups of society. </p>

Blacks are sadistic to animals.  That is what I tell people and that&rsquo;s the sole justification I need for my racial views, and I&rsquo;ll that to anyone who asks.  </p>

<p>McNair should be judged for what he was, a good athlete with earned accolades who died for adultery.  People remember, our country loves movies about psycho affairs, well, here is one of the same.</p>

<p>Anon:  &#8220;Then why are there so many more wild animals running around today in Africa, South America and SE Asia than Europe and the US?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the wild animals can defend themselves, and they live in jungle areas that offer them excellent cover.  Do you think some indigenous, barbaric animal abuser wants to go head to head with an animal that has an even chance of surviving?</p>
<p>Now if you&rsquo;re talking about other wildlife that can&rsquo;t protect itself like birds, monkeys, etc., they ARE in short supply wherever these black cruelty merchants live.</p>
<p>Black poachers in Africa will destroy any habitat and kill any animals they have to in order to get ivory from an elephant or to cut off the hands of a gorilla for ashtrays they sell to third world contries.  </p>
<p>Non-whites have a natural propensity for cruelty to animals.  A trip to Africa or any other third world country will offer enough proof for anybody to verify for himself the veracity of that statement.<br>

		<p>If only it were so. Our greedy, lowlife capitalists will prostitute themselves to endow richness back upon Mikie with TV &amp; movie deals, book deals,interviews. Commentator jobs, perhaps even behind-the-scenes positions such as assistant coaches, etc. will keep Mikie in the good life to which he had become accustomed.</p>
<p>As a Georgian, is is indeed fulfilling to hear Arthur Blank, who would virtually sleep with the bum before now adamantly refusing to let Mikie come back to the Falcons. </p>
