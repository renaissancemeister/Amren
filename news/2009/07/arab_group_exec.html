<h1><a href="https://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2009/07/02/9997971-sun.html">Arab Group Exec Quits After Online Tirade</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brett Clarkson and Joe Warmington, Toronto Sun, July 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Canadian Arab Federation moved to distance itself from one of its own executives who resigned yesterday after he apparently posted &#8220;F  &mdash;   Canada Day&#8221; on his Facebook page, called Canada a &#8220;genocidal state,&#8221; and said he &#8220;couldn&rsquo;t be more ashamed to be Canadian.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tirade on Omar Shaban&rsquo;s profile stirred up a firestorm of controversy and put CAF leaders in damage-control mode as they were quick to condemn the posting on the social networking site.</p>
<p>Just after 8:30 last night, Shaban, 23, resigned his post as the CAF&rsquo;s executive vice-president for Western Canada, CAF national president Khaled Mouammar confirmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a big outcry from our member organizations and it was felt that he had to correct that,&#8221; Mouammar said. &#8220;He decided that the best thing for him to do was to resign.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Ashamed&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Shaban didn&rsquo;t return requests from the Sun for interviews and to verify that the comments on his personal Facebook status update were indeed his writings. But his Facebook page spoke volumes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s finally Canada Day .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Couldn&rsquo;t be more ashamed to be Canadian,&#8221; he wrote, apparently in reference to Canada&rsquo;s treatment of the native population.</p>
<p>Mouammar said the comments don&rsquo;t reflect the views of the CAF, a group that represents more than 40 Arab organizations across the country.</p>
<p>Tarek Fatah, founder of the Muslim Canadian Congress and a media commentator who has been critical of the CAF in the past, called the comments &#8220;hateful&#8221; and that Canadians shouldn&rsquo;t tolerate it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This hateful attitude towards Canada is a direct result of how some politicians and police have refused to stand up to Islamists, either out of fear or for electoral expediency,&#8221; Fatah said.</p>
<p>According to the CAF website, Shaban was born in Canada in 1986 and was raised in Lebanon where his family lived in the Nahr El-Barid refugee camp for a short time.<br>

		<p>  If he is ashamed to be Canadian then he should go back to Lebanon and renounce his Canadian citizenship so he can live in the country his family came from or he should immigrate to a country that he would be proud to be part of where ever it may be.<br>

		<p>I live in Canada, and I&rsquo;ve noticed how Muslim immigrants on campus try to stoke Western guilt.  </p>
<p>Their position is that because of the history of white colonialism, whites don&rsquo;t have a moral right to be proud or stand up for their culture.  They pretend to speak as &#8216;Canadians&rsquo; (which they are not) and cry loudly about how Canadians should atone for injustices.  Some whites fall for this nonsense.  </p>
<p>Many other Canadians, infuriated by this ex-pat Middle Easterner, have told him to pack up and go back to his homeland.</p>

		<p> Canada, like every other White nation, is undergoing disposession.<br>
While every other race considers their own people allies, Whites are in opposition with themselves, mostly broken down on sex, age, and location .<br>
Whites are almost enthused at their demise. This is truly historic in that no race in history has ever been against itself and survived. </p>
<p>Just my $0.02 worth.</p>

		<p>Canadians have been mentally conditioned more intensely than Americans and adopted multiculturalism with the fervor of a religious zealot.</p>
<p>Organs of communication did a lot to bring the deterioration about, like the large newspapers and television, but, like the US Northeast, small monthly and weekly newspapers are known to have influenced leftist thought to a substantial degree, as well as the universities.</p>
<p>Somebody wrote a piece trying to prompt people to start up social conservative publications to try to offset the influence, but it&rsquo;s far too late for that.</p>
<p>We reached the point of no return probably about 1985 when the 1965 immigration fiasco had a few years to work its evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get interesting throughout the West pretty soon, though, because the economic data is coming in looking worse and worse.  Already, they&rsquo;re talking about another stimulus package, because the first one was ineffective,  (Big surprise, eh?)  </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if the PC agenda was destroyed and forgotten in one riot after another after so many years of working toward its implementation to the exclusion of all else?</p>

		<p>Many people are creating their own political dossiers on MySpace and Facebook.  In the near future, a lot of political careers will be stillborn due to electronic trails.  &#8220;Mr Candidate, in 2007 you clearly stated that Whites are the cancer of history.  Would you care to elaborate?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a white Canadian, and I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m overly proud of my country and feel like cheering it on on Canada Day, although I would never stoop as low as Mr. Shaban. The reason I don&rsquo;t feel particularly patriotic is because as a white Canadian (and male to boot), I&rsquo;m a rather despised species. I work hard, pay more than my fair share of taxes, have no criminal record, etc., but so what? It&rsquo;s multiculturalism and third-world immigration that have soured me on Canada. I have presumably nothing of value, and I&rsquo;m expected to endorse all the cultural traits brought with immigrants from their respective third-world hell holes. In other words, I&rsquo;m a second-class citizen, through no fault of my own, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter how hard I work or how good I am, no federal government of any political leaning will ever cater to me. Third world immigrants are what counts, which explains why the right-wing Conservatives bend over backwards for them, and the NDP (supposed workers&rsquo; party) loves them to pieces (despite the damage they cause to Canadian workers). Nobody speaks for me, and I feel like a despised species. Can you blame me for not being patriotic? But even so, I&rsquo;d never denigrate Canada in the fashion that Mr. Shaban has. You gotta have some class, I guess.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster/commentator #2. I have seen muslims try to guilt-trip us White Canadians, and yes, some ignorant Whites do fall for this baloney about &#8220;natives&#8221; being treated badly. It&rsquo;s the Ghetto Lottery - Canada style. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that all or most muslims feel the same way. Just because we are friendly to the Jewish nation and usually harsh toward muslim terrorists, we get lip and attitude from muslims. I for one, wouldn&rsquo;t shed a tear if all muslims left MY country. There would be far less &#8220;cultural enrichent&#8221; (ie gang rapes and terrorist plots) but I think I could live without those &#8220;enriching&#8221; experiences.</p>
<p>Also, anyone see the irony here? This muslim is worried about how Whites ALLEGEDLY took indian land, yet he NEVER apologised for the 100s of millions of deaths that muslims have caused since the evil day of its inception.</p>

		<p>People such as Omar Shaban  &mdash;  and there are millions of them in the West (some of them, like Shaban himself, born and raised in our midst)  &mdash;  are destroying us. </p>
<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism&#8221; is short for &#8220;Death to the West!&#8221; It&rsquo;s so obvious at this point that only a liar or a fool would deny it. </p>

		<p>I agree with #2. I&rsquo;ve also noticed that some minorities agitate against their country of residence by pretending to be a loyal citizen when in fact they are a fifth column.</p>
<p>Also, I realize this is a minor point but the article said that the Canadian Arab Federation&rsquo;s executive vice-president for Western Canada was only 23 years old. I find that odd.</p>

 population.</b></p>
<p>I have news for you. </p>
<p>1. Just because the Canadian media calls you a Canadian, <br>
we whites <b>know</b> you&rsquo;re not a Canadian.  You&rsquo;re an <br>
Arab,  living in Canada unwanted. </p>
<p>2. We all know you aren&rsquo;t going anywhere; in fact, <br>
you&rsquo;re probably arranging to bring your whole family over <br>
to suck at the welfare teat. </p>
<p>3. Arabs have no right to shame Canadians on their treatment <br>
of the natives when Arabs themselves are legendary for <br>
harassing and raping maids from Indonesia and the Philippines, <br>
and when those maids try to file a police complaint, <br>
they are accused of adultery, which will earn them a <br>
public whipping.  And this is going on TODAY   &mdash;   the war <br>
against the Indians happened centuries ago. </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;It seems to me a certainty that the fatalistic teachings of Mohammed and the utter degradation of the Arab women are the outstanding causes for the arrested development of the Arab. He is exactly as he was around the year 700, while we have been developing.&rdquo;&hellip;George S. Patton.</i></p>

		<p>I think this book is relevant to the discussion regarding Canada&rsquo;s love affair with third world immigrants, including Arabs and Muslims: United in Hate: The Left&rsquo;s Romance with Tyranny and Terror, which can be found at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/l26sy7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/l26sy7</a></p>
