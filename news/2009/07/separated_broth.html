<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE church of La Placita, &#8220;the little square&#8221;, formally called Nuestra Se√±ora Reina de Los Angeles, was founded under Spanish rule at around the same time as the pueblo bearing the same name, the future Los Angeles. As the land on which it stood became first Mexican and then American, it always stayed Latino in both look and character, says Father Richard Estrada. Catholicism and Hispanic culture seemed inseparable there.</p>
<p>They still largely are. Virtually all Father Estrada&rsquo;s parishioners are Hispanic, most of them of Mexican extraction. When Guatemalan and Salvadorean refugees showed up in the 1980s, it was natural for them, as good Catholics, to find sanctuary at La Placita, where they slept on the pews and Father Estrada gave them food. It was natural again in 2006, when the country went on an anti-immigrant binge, for many of the Latino counter-marches to start from La Placita. Latinos still come from all over southern California for baptisms and prayer, social services and a sense of community.</p>
<p>But more and more grandmothers also come to Father Estrada with worries about children or grandchildren who have become hermanos separados, separated brothers, after defecting to an evangelical church, usually one with a Pentecostal flavour. The converts may have followed one of the evangelicals who come to La Placita to recruit, or friends whom they met at a spiritual rock concert or picnic. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t worry, but I find it to be challenging,&#8221; says Father Estrada.</p>
<p>Some 68% of Hispanics in America are still Catholic, according to the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, and their absolute number, thanks to immigration and higher birth rates, continues to increase. But about 15% are now born-again evangelicals, who are fast gaining &#8220;market share&#8221;, as Gaston Espinosa, a professor of religion at Claremont McKenna College, puts it. He estimates that about 3.9m Latino Catholics have converted, and that &#8220;for every one who comes back to the Catholic church, four leave it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The main reason, he thinks, is ethnic identity. Evangelical services are not only in Spanish, as many Catholic sermons are nowadays, but are performed by Latinos rather than Irish or Polish-American priests, with the cadences, rhythms, innuendos and flow familiar from the mother country. The evangelical services tend to be livelier than Catholic liturgy and to last longer, often turning into an outing lasting the whole day. Women play greater roles, and there are fewer parishioners for each pastor than in the Catholic church.</p>
<p>The evangelical churches are also more &#8220;experiential&#8221;, says Samuel Rodriguez, a third-generation Puerto Rican Pentecostal pastor and the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, an evangelical association. In the Catholic church, a believer&rsquo;s relationship with Jesus is mediated through hierarchies and bureaucracies, he says, whereas the evangelical churches provide direct access to Jesus. The Pentecostals go one step further, with the &#8220;gifts of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (1 Corinthians) letting believers speak in tongues and pray for divine healing.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first group in America to reconcile both the vertical and the horizontal parts of the cross,&#8221; says Mr Rodriguez. By this he means that the Latino evangelical churches emphasise not only &#8220;covenant, faith and righteousness&#8221; (the vertical part), as white evangelicals do, but also &#8220;community, public policy and social justice&#8221; (the horizontal part), as many black evangelicals, but fewer white ones, do. To Latino evangelicals it is all one thing, he says, and the social outreach the church provides goes far beyond any government programme, with pastors snatching young men away from gang life and fighting to uphold the rights of immigrants.</p>
<p>This also means that Latino evangelicals as a political force are distinct from white evangelicals. Many of the whites have veered hard right, hating abortion and gay marriage and reliably voting Republican, though less so very recently. Latinos tend to be even more pro-life and traditional marriage than whites, says Mr Rodriguez, but only because they know that &#8220;mom and dad in the home is the prime antidote to gangs and drugs.&#8221; That same pragmatism makes them believe in government services and the taxes that pay for them, and of course in immigrant rights. As voters, he reckons, Latino evangelicals are therefore the quintessential independents, up for grabs by either party.</p>
<p>But it may be American Catholicism that changes the most. About a third of American Catholics are Latino now, and their share is growing. Their influence is not only physical and linguistic, with more of them turning up at church. They are also different Catholics, with more than half describing themselves as &#8220;charismatics&#8221;, according to the Pew report. Charismatics remain in their traditional denomination, but believe in some aspects of Pentecostalism, such as the gifts of the Holy Spirit, especially the speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>Latino charismatics see themselves as a renewal movement within Catholicism, as it converges with other churches. And in general all churchgoing Latinos tend to see themselves as renewing Christianity in America. That makes them a powerful force as demographic changes turn America ever more Hispanic, and increasingly different from secular Europe.<br>

		<p>Most of these peasant morons can&rsquo;t read Spanish or English above the 4th grade level let alone Latin or Greek, of which they have never heard anything. They think Jesus spoke in street Spanish.</p>
<p>The average peasant in Judea in the era of Jesus and Paul knew more about the Bible(Torah) than most Latino teachers, let alone the drones who dig ditches and clean tables. I&rsquo;m not knocking hard work by anybody, and I respect it deeply. But I&rsquo;m not going to have the future of religion put in the hands of mentally challenged adults who think like  children, who are illiterate generally, and illiterate specifically about Biblical writings, commentary by famous scholars of several religions, history of religion, and philosophy. </p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t spell philosophy in Spanish let alone English, and can&rsquo;t think abstractly or consider various viewpoints in the course of making spiritual or even practical decisions. </p>
<p>The morons shall inherit the Earth, I am afraid.</p>

		<p>    The catholic church of my youth is gone. What&rsquo;s left is a hierachy of traitorous child molesters.The faithful europeans are the salt of the earth. But they have been betrayed by careerist types that coddled pedophiles for the sake of advancement.Why would otherwise intelligent parishoners allow themselves to be bossed by a bunch of unelected dumpfkoffs.Once you become American and fight and sacrifice, enough of the slave-like devotion to church authority.</p>

		<p>Note that whites are said to &#8220;hate abortion and gay marriage&#8221;, while Latinos are &#8220;more pro-life and traditional marriage&#8221;.  Those nasty, hateful whites strike again.  What we need are more peaceful, gentle Latinos, speaking in tongues and rolling on the floor.  :)<br>

		<p>It is so obvious that this writer, like so many pundits, commentators and idiot intellectuals knows nothing about the Roman Catholic Arch diocese of Los Angeles.  </p>
<p>First, some priests may have Irish or Polish names, but they are all bilingual in Spanish.  It is a basic requirement.  Then too, for more than 200 years, very few Irish or Poles ever settled in Los Angeles.  It&rsquo;s not Chicago or New York. There are very few Poles or  Irish catholics in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Second, the archdiocese bends over backward to turn the Universal, all inclusive, supposedly way beyond national boundaries church into a Mexican catholic church.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the catholics of European white and Asian descent who are made to feel uncomfortable in the churches their parents and grandparents built.</p>
<p>That church she mentioned is lovely.  It was built by the Franciscans around 1775.  It is right in the Olevera st historic pueblo site.  If you are ever in Los Angeles, go and see it.  It is a million times more attractive than the new cathederal a few blocks away that looks like a walmart.</p>

		<p>Latinos are pro-marriage? Since when? I never see Hispanics married anymore. The 13 year olds are pregnant and the 18 year olds have 4 kids apiece with no husband. The married Hispanic men don&rsquo;t believe in monogamy and the wife puts up with him cheating on her with everyone. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Note that whites are said to &ldquo;hate abortion and gay marriage&rdquo;, while Latinos are &ldquo;more pro-life and traditional marriage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Then why do hispanics who are mostly catholic continue to have the highest abortion rate in the country?</p>
