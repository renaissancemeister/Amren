	<p><b>I Want to Sob Like a Child for All We Have Lost</b></p>
<p>I was born in Oakland, California, in 1944 and raised in a lower middle-class area of the city. There was only one non-white family in the neighborhood, and crime was almost unheard of. For example, once a week I was required to accompany my aunt on an all-day shopping excursion to downtown Oakland. Before leaving, my aunt would open wide both the front and back doors to her home, in order to let in fresh air. Those doors were open for six to eight hours straight, and no one ever trespassed. The family car was always parked overnight with its doors unlocked and its windows rolled down. No one ever tampered.</p>
<p>Slowly, incrementally, the demographic and political profile of the city changed, and by the late &rsquo;60s to early &rsquo;70s, it was no longer the city I had loved. Oakland had become an unhealthy, dangerous place. My racial consciousness arose from the many experiences a white man must endure in the inner city.</p>
<p>It came, in part, from the owner of the neighborhood grocery store (a Chinese immigrant) being gunned down in front of his wife and three small children. And from the owner of the local liquor store (a Hungarian immigrant), shot to death while his wife pleaded for his life. And from John, the elderly owner of the local hardware store, being dragged into a rear room of his store, his lifeless form discovered several hours later, his skull having been smashed to bits with a hammer taken from his own inventory. And from my arriving home from work one afternoon to find that everything I owned had been stolen from my duplex, with the exception of the rifle I kept hidden behind the water heater.</p>
<p>It arose in part from the endless stream of nonsense spewing from the mouths of the &#8220;oppressed:&#8221; Power to the people. Send a pig to heaven with a .357. Black is beautiful. Try black and you&rsquo;ll never go back. Keep it black &#8216;til I get back.</p>
<p>It arose also from the media making heroes out of local radical groups and individuals (who were nothing more than common street thugs): the SLA, the Soledad Brothers, the Black Panthers, Huey Newton, Eldridge Cleaver, Angela Davis  &mdash;  the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>It arose from the degenerates of my own race in Berkeley, the Castro district, and Haight-Ashbury, and also from having a large caliber revolver placed to my temple while being told, &#8220;I&rsquo;m gonna blow your white m***** f****** brains out, Honky!&#8221; My racial consciousness is a product of all of these things and so many more, the total weight of which I could no longer endure.</p>
<p>To my discredit I fled California in 1987. I&rsquo;ve since lived in Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Tucson. With each move I&rsquo;ve sought to restore the quality of life I was so privileged to enjoy as a youth. I have failed in my quest.</p>
<p>I want back my city! My streets! My ocean! I want back my schools, my infrastructure, my arts, and the companionship of like-minded citizens. I want the comradeship of similar people working together to achieve similar goals. And I once again want to stand atop the high ground just north of the Golden Gate and gaze toward the city in wide-eyed wonderment at the panorama my race created. And as I write this I want to drop to my knees, round my shoulders, and sob like an abandoned child for all we have lost.</p>

<p><b>I Believed My Ancestors Were Bad</b></p>
<p>I would like to share my experiences of living in Los Angeles as a white teenager. My father has always tried to instill a love for my heritage and pride in the accomplishments of Europeans, even though everywhere else, I was being told the opposite. I didn&rsquo;t quite understand what my father wanted me to be proud of.</p>
<p>Until ninth grade, I believed my European ancestors were bad, that they were racist, and hated anyone unlike them. I believed this because it is what I was taught in school. It was all over the media, and I couldn&rsquo;t escape it. I did not think what I was hearing was wrong.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until high school that I began to understand. Every one of my classes had an agenda to make white people feel bad about their heritage and ancestry. Being a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, Caucasian female in LA, I have encountered much racism. The students at my school were mostly blacks and Hispanics, and I began to dread having to go to classes and hear insults aimed at my people every day. I was always around people who are not tolerant of fair-skinned people, but I was supposed to have respect for them. I decided home schooling would be better for me.</p>
<p>I enjoy reading your publication. Both my father and I like to hear about other white men and women waking up and opening their eyes to the truth. I am proud to be white and I won&rsquo;t let anyone tell me differently. Thank you for helping our race.</p>

<p><b>&#8220;Racist&#8221; Feelings Were Something Immoral</b></p>
<p>I am 43 years old, an educated, self-employed professional working in a technical field in a large mid-western city. I first met black people in elementary school when they were bused from the black part of the city to our genteel neighborhood school. My observations at the time, as a 4th, 5th, and 6th grader, were that the few black children tended to be loud, unruly, and not too smart. With the exception of one well-behaved black boy who applied himself, the others caused my teachers a disproportionate amount of the relatively little trouble they had in a 1960s middle-class elementary school.</p>
<p>I wish you could see the class photo of my 6th grade class  &mdash;  three rows of beaming white faces, two smiling black girls who were amiable but loud and dull-witted, and one large-for-his age, scowling black boy standing in the back row, half-turned away from the camera, with a classic case of &#8220;attitude.&#8221; He was also the class bully, and terrorized some of my friends and me. At this point I had already begun to form a poor impression of blacks but, as a child, I didn&rsquo;t think deeply about this.</p>
<p>As I went through high school, more and more blacks were bused to our school, and the pattern of classroom disruption continued. There were the outbursts of hallway fighting between blacks or between blacks and the tough whites from the poorer neighborhoods. I had two black friends, girls who were gregarious and reasonably studious. One became pregnant by a 15-year-old black boy when she was a senior. By the end of high school, my impression of blacks as dull-witted, irresponsible, loud and disruptive was pretty well set, but I still did not think in terms of racial consciousness. I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable around blacks, and I didn&rsquo;t respect any of the blacks I knew (except for one studious girl and the studious boy from elementary school), but I felt that being outspoken about my &#8220;racist&#8221; feelings was something immoral that had to be hidden, something I needed to grow out of.</p>
<p>As the years passed and I met more black people in college, graduate school, and in the workplace, my impressions did not change. There was the psychotic black woman in the dormitory where I worked as a residential advisor, who harassed the white women on her floor; the clique of black students who insisted on having a &#8220;blacks only&#8221; social organization funded with student government money; my advisor in graduate school, a black woman who taught in a graduate journalism program but was a poor speller and who could not finish paperwork by the necessary deadlines. In my field of computers, the few blacks I have met have been at best borderline competent.</p>
<p>By my mid-30s, I was firmly convinced that blacks are a problem for white society but I didn&rsquo;t see a moral justification for doing anything about it. I had never been exposed to anything like AR or a well-reasoned racialist argument. I felt that my secret resentments of and poor opinion of blacks were personal weaknesses for which I would be answerable in the next life.</p>
<p>What changed my mind were two arguments.</p>
<p>I had arrived at a political view that was mostly libertarian: Give us back our freedom of association and we can voluntarily separate from troublesome blacks. Stop taking away our money to support indolent, sexually irresponsible blacks, and we will have fewer problems. But then I read that whites will eventually become a minority in this country. Combine that with the fact that no majority-black or -Hispanic nation has ever maintained a society of the kind whites create, and it becomes a logical certainty that whites must politically and geographically separate themselves from blacks and Hispanics if we are to survive as a people.</p>
<p>The other powerful argument that convinced me a racialist approach was necessary was evidence like that presented in <cite>The Bell Curve,</cite> that blacks are less intelligent than whites and more emotional and disruptive and crime-prone for genetic reasons. I used to think blacks&rsquo; problems could be fixed with education or social programs, but I became convinced social programs can&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I began to search for web sites that had articles on these matters, and this is when I came across AR. I have concluded, based on the dispassionate, reasoned arguments I have found in AR and a few other places, that much as I would like to be an idealist, the reality is that whites simply must separate themselves from blacks in some manner that protects us as a people. I feel a sadness for the decent black people who through no fault of their own are part of a race that as a whole is unable to manage its affairs. I hope there is a way to order the world so that blacks can be free and prosperous and that people can have goodwill towards one another.</p>
<p>The only approach to race that has a chance of working is one that avoids histrionics and does not demonize others. One reason so many whites feel uncomfortable with racialist ideas is their historical association with violence and white supremacy. The white man who blew up the black girls in that Birmingham church did a great deal of harm to the white race. Violence or shrillness will never convince white people who may well have doubts about blacks but think it is immoral to be &#8220;racist.&#8221; Talking about &#8220;Jews&#8221; as the source of the problem smacks of Nazism  &mdash;  another violent movement that did us great harm.</p>
<p>I have made racial arguments to a few of my closest friends, and I know they can have an impact. Still, it takes time for people to give themselves permission to think in a racially conscious way. Even I am still not 100 percent comfortable doing so. But the arguments, the facts, the studies  &mdash;  these, combined with personal experiences will eventually change enough minds to make a difference.</p>

<p><b>Forced Busing Began in Wichita</b></p>
<p>I was born in Wichita, Kansas, in 1958, and have always known blacks were different from whites: louder and more animated. Still, I did not think much about this until I went to junior high school in 1970. That was the year forced busing began in Wichita. Blacks beat whites for no reason, and shook them down for pocket change. It was shocking to us. The few blacks who had been with us in earlier grades were not that way for the first month or two of school, but soon started acting like their 8th and 9th grade brethren.</p>
<p>My increasing dislike for blacks continued through high school. Blacks generally kept their distance in high school, but woe to the white who walked the halls by himself as the end of the school year approached. Blacks did not like taking final examinations. As exam days approached, they would look for a solitary white and beat him up. They would be kicked out of school and not take final exams, but would be passed on to the next grade.</p>
<p>I attended undergraduate school at Kansas State University. In junior high and high school the percentage of blacks has been 15 to 20 percent, but now it was two to four percent. This meant no more black-on-white violence, and I loved it. So did other whites from high schools with many blacks. Still, there were a few negative experiences. Once, at a lecture, a black man walked across most of a row purposely bumping into whites and not excusing himself. When he came to a black student he excused himself.</p>

<p><b>I Needed to Find a New Career</b></p>
<p>I saw the light when I chose public education as a career relatively late in life. I had been a New Thought minister for 11 years, and converted to another faith. That meant I needed to find a new career, so I chose teaching.</p>
<p>One of the first things I learned was that in our jurisdiction you cannot give a black child an IQ test. I couldn&rsquo;t believe my ears. Once I overheard a black mother tell a friend, &#8220;Well, it&rsquo;s time to have another baby. The welfare&rsquo;s about to run out.&#8221; When I went to graduate school to get a teaching credential, I was immediately cast into the world of multiculturalism and its doublespeak. I was told that the great disparity in test scores between white and black and Hispanic kids was caused by institutional racism. That did it. At age 52, I was not exactly wet behind the ears.</p>
<p>I was raised by a Southern mother in Southern California, and she always said there was a difference in capability between whites and blacks. I had always looked for evidence that she was wrong, but now I began to see the evidence that she was right.</p>

<p><b>My Country Is Marching Down the Same Path</b></p>
<p>It is relatively easy for me to pinpoint when my views began to change. The year was 1994, and I learned of a controversial new book called <cite>The Bell Curve,</cite> which was causing a stir even in Canada, where I lived. I had to read the book in order to satisfy my curiosity, even though it required a special order because the bookstores in Halifax, Nova Scotia, were not stocking it.</p>
<p>In 1994 I was 40 years old, so my opinions on practically everything were well established. I had grown up in a town, a province, and a country that were overwhelmingly white. Race had always seemed irrelevant, except as a way periodically to look down on the Americans for their race problems.</p>
<p>I was perplexed by <cite>The Bell Curve.</cite> Could it be true? I had always known that intelligence played a role in life outcomes, but did the races really differ in average IQ? The evidence presented by the authors seemed undeniable. I could not let it rest, and thus my investigations began. I must say they were not easy. There is a tremendous amount of garbage about race put out by a never-ending supply of crackpots and morons. Thank God I accidentally stumbled upon AR.</p>
<p>Michael Levin, Philippe Rushton, Arthur Jensen, Samuel Francis and Jared Taylor became my tutors. Their scholarly articles and books became the core of my curriculum. To be sure, race does matter, and as I&rsquo;ve come to learn, it matters a great deal. My country is marching down the same path as the United States. Non-white immigration is at record levels, and whites are already a minority in two of our three major cities: Vancouver and Toronto. With my awareness comes a profound sadness and sense of foreboding. My nation is changing in countless ways and no one seems to care. I can&rsquo;t help but envision a grim future for my grandchildren.</p>
<div align="right"><i>Name Withheld, Canada</i></div>
<p><b>I Can&rsquo;t Say I Am Completely Convinced</b></p>
<p>I do not agree with everything in AR, but your magazine has helped me streamline my thoughts. For the record, I am an immigrant, so I do not belong to the category of people you favor, but I can understand that.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in the most politically correct country in the world, where multiculturalism and diversity (these terms together were called internationalism) were an integral part of a higher &#8220;religion&#8221; called Communism. Dissent was a crime and punished accordingly. That country was called The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and I think we can learn valuable lessons from its breakdown. Most Americans think Communism and the poor economy were the main reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Those factors played a destructive role, but many do not realize that the policy of &#8220;internationalism&#8221; had a major influence on the disintegration of a once powerful and feared country.</p>
<p>When the Bolsheviks came to power, Lenin stated that &#8220;every nation has the right to self determination.&#8221; What he meant was not independence, but that all parts of the happy Soviet family could preserve their culture, traditions and language as long as they embraced Communism. You will find striking similarities between Lenin&rsquo;s teachings and the views of today&rsquo;s proponents of diversity. For about 70 years the impression was that this policy worked, and at the end of the 1960s, I believe, it was declared that a new entity, the Soviet People, had come into being and that the national question had been solved.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s after I graduated from university I had to travel a lot on business. I talked privately to many people in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine and other former Soviet republics and found that they had an unfavorable opinion of Russians. Some hated Russians outright. At the same time many Russians referred to other nationalities as &#8220;low-lifes.&#8221; However, &#8220;nationalism&#8221; was a severely punishable crime. All people are brothers and brothers don&rsquo;t hate each other. Period.</p>
<p>When Communism fell, one of the first things that happened was that every Soviet Republic declared independence from Russia and formed its own <em>national</em> state.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the majority of newly independent countries realized they would <em>not</em> be better off economically. The Soviet economy had been very tightly integrated to ensure that none of the republics could gain economic independence. In many cases the economies of those countries deteriorated badly, but people still felt they could manage themselves better as nations. After independence, they started to persuade Russians either to leave their countries or assimilate, learn their language, and accept their culture. There was no more talk of internationalism.</p>
<p>Significantly, there were not as many racial, ethnic or even cultural differences among the nations of what was known as the USSR as there are between whites and blacks in America. Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians are all Slavs, they have similar languages and the same religion. But even for these groups, there were enough differences to warrant separation.</p>
<p>When I lived in Russia, I was an avid listener to the Voice of America, and was under the impression that the situation in the United States was completely different. The many ethnic groups and races all considered themselves American, spoke one language and shared the same culture, traditions and history. When I brought my family to the USA, I considered myself lucky to be here, and I did not think too much about what was happening in this country. Only later I started to notice things that did not seem to be quite right.</p>
<p>It was not any major event that altered my views, but small things. When we came to the US my son was four and didn&rsquo;t speak English. When he went to kindergarten I immediately was offered all sorts of special programs for him. I insisted that he be treated the same as any other kid. The school administration told me we needed to preserve his language, culture and traditions. After a couple of meetings with teachers they finally backed off and in six months my son spoke English as well as any other kid in his class. I had to go through the same thing when my younger son enrolled in school.</p>
<p>When we bought a house it was in a nice, well-kept neighborhood, but after four years things slowly started to change. My next-door neighbors sold their house to Sikh immigrants from India. I found I couldn&rsquo;t open windows or enjoy our rose garden anymore because of the incredibly strong smell of curry in the air. To make things worse, they were cooking in the garage with all the doors open. After some hesitation, I politely explained that although I respect their right to cook and eat whatever they want, they in return should respect my right not to smell what they are cooking. They called me racist, fascist and Nazi. I was shocked.</p>
<p>I talked to other neighbors about this. Some agreed with me, but said nothing can be done; others said it did not bother them; others called me a Nazi racist again. As the neighborhood became more and more colorful, more and more problems arose. I started to think about this disharmony. I could not find any satisfying answers in the mainstream media, because according to them it was me  &mdash;  an intolerant bigot  &mdash;  who was the problem! I discovered your publication and subscribed to it. I also bought some politically incorrect books and started to study the problem. I can&rsquo;t say I am completely convinced yet by your point of view, but I guess I am still at the beginning of my path to understanding the racial problem. I have learned one thing: Diversifying society brings nothing but harm.</p>
<p>Americans should take a closer look at what happened in the USSR, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Oops! I forgot there are no such countries any more. My sincere hope is that nothing like that will ever happen here.</p>

<p><b>Roaches Crawled Freely About</b></p>
<p>I am probably the only AR subscriber who graduated from a historically black college (HBC), but I really can&rsquo;t say that made me &#8220;see the light.&#8221; I was treated very fairly, and overall my time there was positive. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t realize then how academically sub par the school was, and I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t choose an HBC if I decided to continue my education.</p>
<p>After leaving college I went into law enforcement, and it was there that reality hit me like a club over the head. I realized that all those doubts about blacks I had in the back of my mind were there for a good reason. Despite my college experiences with black people, I had never gone into their neighborhoods and homes. I had never been in homes where roaches crawled freely about, eating food that had obviously been lying on the floor for days. I could never have imagined going into the home of a nearly blind 90-year-old black man who called police because his granddaughter had come over and stolen his Social Security money. I could never have imagined responding to an armed robbery call and discovering the white female convenience store clerk who had confronted the black juvenile female shoplifter in her store, and had gotten the entire side of her mouth cut open with a box cutter  &mdash;  her teeth were clearly visible. And it is hard to describe the anger I felt when I watched a young white mother cry because the black man who had just burgled her home had stolen her video camera and all the precious, irreplaceable tapes of her daughter.</p>
<p>But what I really could never have conceived of before becoming a police officer was the complete lack of guilt and remorse for the terrible acts blacks seem especially capable of committing. I can honestly say I have met some characters whom I consider to be beasts without souls.</p>
<p>When that July 1995 issue of AR arrived in my mailbox  &mdash;  unsolicited  &mdash;  it was like discovering hidden treasure. Here at last were articulate people putting into words what I had known for years to be true, but was constantly told by the establishment media was not true. I still think the cover story, &#8220;The Morality of Survival&#8221; by Michael Masters, was one of the best ever. And through reading AR I discovered authors like Richard McCulloch, whose books make the moral case for racial consciousness as well as anyone. So sixteen years of police work, many books by racialist authors, and of course, AR, have me &#8220;seeing the light&#8221; quite clearly.</p>

<p><b>Proud to Be Gay and Proud to Be White</b></p>
<p>Like the Jewish reader who wrote of his racial awakening in <a href="/news/2009/07/how_i_saw_the_l.html" target="part1" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Part I,</b></a> I am a member of a minority group that is assumed to &#8220;belong&#8221; to the left. As a lesbian, I am supposed to be glad to be a band in Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s rainbow. And for most of my life, I believed the left&rsquo;s rhetoric about identity politics, voted Democrat, and supported the liberal agenda.</p>
<p>Growing up in Los Angeles, I attributed the racial conflicts I experienced to black oppression  &mdash;  when blacks called me &#8220;blondie&#8221; and pushed me around, they were venting legitimate frustration, given their history as victims of the system. When Watts burned, I watched the smoke rise over East LA from the front lawn of my parents&rsquo; working-class home. And, again I rationalized: Years of police brutality had caused the riots, not the blacks themselves. When affirmative action was put in place and blacks were given preference over more qualified whites, I acquiesced. We owed them that much. Even as late as the 1980s I was still buying it. Like most gays and most blacks, I voted for Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>But slowly, my attitude began to change. Although there were many, I can think of three specific events that finally pushed me out of the rainbow. The first was President Clinton&rsquo;s speech about the demographic future of America in which he rejoiced at the impending demise of the white majority. Although I rejected my own reaction at the time as racist, the words that came to my mind were &#8220;traitor to his race.&#8221; I ignored my gut reaction and filed it away.</p>
<p>The second was a job I nearly lost out on because I was white. The man who hired me told me in confidence that although he wanted me for the position, he had been instructed to hire a &#8220;person of color.&#8221; To his credit, he disobeyed his supervisor, ignored this directive, and hired the most qualified candidate. A white friend wasn&rsquo;t so lucky. During a job interview she was told, without apology, that only blacks would be hired.</p>
<p>And third  &mdash;  an outcome that made so many of us question our assumptions of race  &mdash;  was the O.J. Simpson verdict.</p>
<p>As a lesbian, I have never experienced discrimination on the job, and I can count on one hand the number of times I have been verbally harassed because I am gay. As a white person it has been an entirely different story. I have white lesbian friends who have been raped by black men; white gay male friends who have been beaten up by Hispanic gangs (in one case my friend died); and numerous straight white friends whose &#8220;quality of life&#8221; has been reduced by blacks and other people of color.</p>
<p>I am still uneasy with many aspects of the Euro-American movement as I try to reconcile being a proud gay person with being a proud white person. But when push comes to shove, my guess is that race trumps sexual identity, and that I&rsquo;m not the only gay on your subscription list.</p>

<p><b>The Whites Let Out a Collective Gasp</b></p>
<p>I grew up in largely white suburbs in the Midwest and South. While there were always a handful of blacks and other non-whites in the public grade schools I attended, they were for the most part no different from my fellow whites. In behavior, dress, speech and socioeconomic background, we were all pretty much the same; it was in the early to mid 1970s, and I don&rsquo;t believe any of us children were really conscious of race.</p>
<p>That changed dramatically in high school. I went to a school in suburban Atlanta that was virtually all white  &mdash;  typical suburban children from typically suburban families. At first, there were few blacks, and again, other than their skin color, they were pretty much like the rest of us. Then DeKalb County started something called the &#8220;Majority to Minority&#8221; (M to M) transfer program, a voluntary desegregation plan whereby any student could switch schools if it meant leaving one where his race was the majority and going to one where it was a minority. The program was open to whites as well as blacks  &mdash;  I knew one white student who transferred to a black school to play on a better basketball team  &mdash;  but M to M basically meant blacks transferring to white schools.</p>
<p>These were not the blacks we white suburban kids were used to. They came largely from the Atlanta part of DeKalb, or from the black southern portion of the county, and came by the busload. They most definitely did not dress, talk or behave like us, or the blacks we knew and with whom we were comfortable.</p>
<p>The difference was driven home by an incident one day in the cafeteria when two M to M black girls started arguing. They were soon screaming at each other, using the most vile language imaginable, and then they started fighting. At school I had never seen anything more than a scuffle, but this was an intensely violent &#8220;street&#8221; fight. The girls  &mdash;  15 or 16 years old  &mdash;  were punching, kicking, pulling each other&rsquo;s hair, and <em>clawing</em> each other as if they meant nothing short of murder. None of us had ever seen anything like it. The white children sat in stunned silence, our mouths practically hanging open. The idea of breaking up the fight never occurred to us, although if the girls had been white, someone would surely have stepped in.</p>
<p>One of our assistant principals  &mdash;  a very large black man who was a former college linebacker  &mdash;  ran out of his office and got between the girls. This did not end the fight. As he tried to separate them, they both attacked him with the same animal ferocity. One of the girls picked up a cafeteria chair and swung it at his head. He ducked, but a leg caught him on the forehead, opening up a nasty gash. The whites let out a collective gasp. None of us could have imagined striking a school official, much less hitting him with a chair. In her rage, this black girl had lost all fear and, it seemed to us, something of her humanity as well. The assistant principal wrestled the chair from her and managed to get his arms around her while other administrators dealt with the second girl. They hauled the girls off and, as I recall, we never saw them again.</p>
<p>Although the fight lasted just a few minutes, it had a profound effect on many of us. I believe most of us learned our first lesson in racial consciousness that day. We no longer saw blacks as just like us, only darker. They  &mdash;  particularly the M to M blacks  &mdash;  were different: profoundly alien and potentially dangerous.</p>
<p>The M to M program itself seemed to awaken a racial consciousness in our parents. As the school got more M to M transfers, whites began to leave. White families with children in public schools began moving to other, more distant whiter counties. Blacks bought their homes. As more blacks moved into the area, the schools became blacker, prompting still more whites to leave. When I left that part of DeKalb County in the early 1980s, it appeared to be 90 percent white. Within a decade, it was perhaps 40 percent white. I would imagine the figure today is closer to 10 percent.</p>

		<p>My conversion to racialism wasn&rsquo;t really a conversion, because I was never really a racial liberal.  There was a period in my life, between the ages of 16 to 20, when I was sort of a lamestream conservative on race, opposed to affirmative action and similar measures, but stubbornly holding on to egalitarianism and Lincolnian ideologies. </p>
<p>Those were the ages I was starting my right-wing activism.  Part of that was listening to talk radio, in St. Louis locally and nationally. Friday nights on WGNU, 920 on the AM dial, had &#8220;The Right at Night,&#8221; hosted by a National leader and a local leader of the Council of Conservative Citizens.  Once I joined, I learned about Sam Francis and Jared Taylor, and many others.  That&rsquo;s when I became a full fledged racialist, having learned not only scientific, but also common sense explanations for my racialism.</p>

		<p><i>One reason so many whites feel uncomfortable with racialist ideas is their historical association with violence and white supremacy.</i></p>
<p>No, no, no.  It&rsquo;s a modern mass media association, not an &#8220;historical&#8221; one.</p>
<p>If &#8220;historical associations&#8221; actually made any difference, anti-racism, radical egalitarianism, blank-slatism, big government, and the rest of the commie platform would suffer negative social connotations a multiple of that suffered by racialism.</p>
<p>The commies killed way more people, in the name of half the planks in the liberal establishment platform.  Where are the associations?  Oh, they&rsquo;re waiting to be unleashed by billions of dollars worth of propagada, sorry, I mean entertainment.</p>

		<p>I always was a racialist because bolth of my parents were wise enough to be racialists of the AR type, too.What really made me more of a racialist was all of the hate motivated black on white violence, much of it that I learned of not through the media, but from word of mouth, and all of the racism that blacks emit, and how hypocritical they so often are in regards to racism.</p>

		<p>Hi. My name is Whitey, and I&rsquo;m a racist. Unlike most people on AmRen, my race realism didn&rsquo;t begin in school. I was born in a suburb of Chicago, but my parents moved to rural NW Oklahoma in 1980. I went to a very small school, a total of 168 or so students, and that was the ENTIRE school, K-12. All white, except for 2 American Indians, and two half-black, half-white brothers that moved to the area when I was in 5th grade. No racial problems, no drugs, no violence, no politically correct revisionist history classes. </p>
<p>All I knew of blacks, and of other minorities, was what I saw on TV and movies. I would hear my parents, and other adults, talk of black&rsquo;s bad behavior, but I didn&rsquo;t really comprehend. Then I went to college. The school I went to didn&rsquo;t have separate athletic dorms, so I got my first taste of diversity-blasting rap music, yelling, screaming, blacks walking down the hall and intentionally running into whites and asians, cutting in lines, etc. I lasted 1 semester at that school until I transfered to a smaller school closer to my home.</p>
<p>At the smaller school, a small college in rural NW Oklahoma, I got my first taste of anti-white ranting, in the form of a white, blonde, middle aged female Socialogy teacher who never missed a chance to bash white males, throughly and consistantly. I dropped that class after a few weeks, and took another socialogy class the following semester, taught by an American Indian middle aged woman, that oddly enough revolved around statistics and scientific evidence and open discussion of all points of view and not white male bashing.</p>
<p>From there, it was onto the military, where my racist eyes where truely opened. In basic training, the handful of blacks tried their best to stare down and intimidate the whites and hispanics, when they weren&rsquo;t busy trying to sneak out of the barracks or rapping about selling drugs and b**ches.</p>
<p>However, just as most whites seem to be in a state of shock when they first encounter true black behavior, I think blacks are shocked when they have to deal with whites on a personal level. Blacks are shocked when whites don&rsquo;t back down and aren&rsquo;t intimidated. Blacks are shocked when whites aren&rsquo;t afraid of them. Blacks are conditioned to believe whites are afraid of them.</p>
<p>After basic it was on the regular army, where I had the opportunity to experience more diversity, in the form of being sent to a unit that was 95% black, including a black female first sergeant, all black platoon sergeants. They weren&rsquo;t not shy about their white-hating. If you were white, you could expect to be put on every detail and never be giving a chance to go to the promtion board. You could also expect to hear more about rims, grillz, baby mammas, and go to da club, than you would ever want to know. I never met one black, even the 18 year olds, that didn&rsquo;t have at least one kid. One black guy was literally shocked when I told him I didn&rsquo;t have any kids.</p>
<p>Following a deployment to Iraq, I left active duty and went to the Illinois National Guard. I went into a small unit, mostly white, with some hispanics. Everything was fine, until we, and most of the Illinois National Guard, were deployed to Afghanistan. Because we were such a small unit, we received a lot of additional troops, including 6 blacks (5 males, 1 female) from the Chicago area. I&rsquo;m sure every AmRen reader can guess the results. Constant conflicts with these 6. I personally had confrontations with 2 of them, including the female, after she cut in line for a hands-on weapon training session and turned her back to me after I told her she wasn&rsquo;t cutting in line. These 6 blacks (all of them PFC and below) have terrorized the entire unit. I&rsquo;ve overheard them talking about how if a white person tells them to do something, they&rsquo;ll just stare them down, knowing that the white will be too afraid to push the issue (Of course, the discusion wasn&rsquo;t worded like that, but that was the ebonic jist of it.) All the whites are apparantly too afraid to deal with them. I can only imagine what their home unit is like.</p>
<p>I was injured in Afghanistan and sent home, so I don&rsquo;t know what further problems they have caused. I do know one the them, while on guard duty in a tower, unplugged the communications radio so he could plug in his playstation portable. </p>
<p>Now I live in a small town about an hour outside of Chicago. Everyday I have to deal with mexican gangsta wanna-be&rsquo;s walking down the middle of the streets. They won&rsquo;t move for cars and stare you down while you drive around them. The little grocery store is constantly tagged with gang grafitti. I see no future in the U.S.A. I see no future for any white country, or the white race. We&rsquo;ve been sold out. The younger whites have been brainwashed into thinking being white is shameful and boring, and being black is cool. Whites are afraid to stand up. I&rsquo;m afraid there is no future.</p>

		<p>I can relate to all the above stories. So now, that there are millions of us who have experienced and feel the same way, what are we going to do about it? We owe this to our descendants and it is our duty to make it right for them. We allowed this to happen and were too afraid to speak out and we need to use any means necessary to stop the insanity. Voting for either party will not do it. They don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p> I was aghast in 1965 when that Immigration Act was passed. I was aghast that the Civil Rights Act was passed. I was aghast at the order of desegregation throughout the nation. Why do we allow ourselves to be enslaved and punished this way? Can anyone answer that question?</p>

		<p>I grew up in a medium sized town in southwest Louisiana close to the Texas border. While there were a couple of black kids in the schools that I attended there were never really enough to gang up or band together and attack white students. In fact, most of the black kids were the children of more upwardly mobile black lawyers, doctors and other professionals. Even though we knew that there was a predominantly black side of town we never went there because there was never a reason for any of us to. My parents were very liberal where school for me was concerned and when I was going into 5th grade they managed to get me into one of the new, so called &#8220;magnet schools&#8221; that were usually just a new term for trying to make failing schools better. Much of the time these were traditionally nearly all black schools in poor neighborhoods, the &#8220;magnet&#8221; title was merely a ploy to try to get good students from other schools to transfer this particular school was mixed but was in a very poor neighborhood. It was the first time that I was around blacks in any kind of number. As others on this board have stated, as soon as blacks get into about the 5th grade or so they start to mature at a much faster rate than the white (or other race) kids in the class. During fifth grade, the slower black students kept the white students who had transferred from other schools from getting ahead and the &#8220;extended day&#8221; program was obstensively a day care for the poor students of both races to be watched until parents came home from work. Loud screaming blacks often disrupted class and harassed the white kids mercilessly. It was only a move to Oklahoma that prevented me from attending a magnet middle school which would have been much worse. </p>
<p>The school I ended up attending for middle school was nearly all white but again, I was subjected to a &#8220;magnet&#8221; school for my freshman year of high school. This time the school that had been made into the magnet school was formerly an all black school in the days of segregation and was in a very scary black neighborhood on the north side of Tulsa just past downtown. At first I liked the school but I soon noticed that the school was always full of trash in the halls, damaged books and classrooms and constant fighting. During that year I had 2 jackets, a necklace and numerous other things stolen from me. By the end of the year I had to bring only the bare essencials to school. It was pretty obvious that the blacks were there because of tradition and led the sports and social scene, the whites did not participate in dances or other social activities. When the school elected its first white homecoming queen there was a near riot among black parents as well as kids. I left the school after only one year and I still had no idea about what blacks were really about until about 10 years after I left high school. </p>
<p>It was not until I left college and moved into the working world that I could see what blacks were really about. I had assumed that the loud behavior, trashed hallways and &#8220;no go&#8221; zones were part of high school and had no place in the &#8220;real world&#8221; I was wrong. Whenever blacks congregated for lunch or breaks the room was always in extreme disarray when they left. Most whites did their best to schedule lunch hours when the blacks would not be present. I also noticed that most of the management were black and they often treated whites with distain or outright contempt. When I was hired for a new job I had to attend a training session that was a large percentage of blacks. The black trainees asked nuisance questions and generally took up so much time that the other trainees who were ready to go on had to wait for them to catch up. I was more than willing to stay at my current job when I was offered a raise and better hours. As I saw more and more special programs, assistance and other aid set aside just for blacks or other minorities I realized that no matter what whites did for them it would never be enough. Even though I had not been born until 1971 I would have to be made to pay or atone for what my supposed ancestors did. My unique Southern culture was denegrated and many things that I previously had taken pride in were now considered &#8220;racist&#8221;. I now realize the further away from blacks that I can be the better. I do not have a problem with most blacks but since I am considered a &#8220;racist oppressor&#8221; merely because I am white I do my best to avoid all blacks, especially ones who tend to travel in packs.  </p>

		<p>I grew up in Virginia in the 1940s and 1950s, but was a racial liberal and lefty radical by the time I arrived in Berkeley, Ca. about 35 years ago, where I still live.</p>
<p>I had countless bad experiences with blacks here  &mdash;  girlfriends raped, myself beat up, regular insults on the street, but for me this all existed in another world from my ideology  &mdash;  it didn&rsquo;t even occur to me that the events I was experiencing might speak in some way to the views I held.</p>
<p>Fortunately, about 10 years ago I entered into a long-distance correspondence with someone who brought me to my senses.</p>
<p>I had written the fellow concerning another subject, but our letters soon became a discussion of race, with him pressing the white racialist point of view and me defending racial liberalism.</p>
<p>After months of stalemate, I decided to sit down with all his letters and see if there was something in them I&rsquo;d overlooked or hadn&rsquo;t understood.</p>
<p>I noticed, for the first time, that in almost every letter he spoke of integration having created &#8220;racial conflict&#8221; or &#8220;racial tension.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those two phrases had been passing right through me, because they didn&rsquo;t mean anything to me  &mdash;  I had no notion that such a thing as &#8220;racial conflict&#8221; or &#8220;racial tension&#8221; even existed!</p>
<p>But as I thought about it, it began to dawn on me that what I had been experiencing for 20 years out here was exactly &#8220;racial conflict&#8221; and &#8220;racial tension!&#8221; (DUH!!!!!!&hellip;!)</p>
<p>Countless experiences large and small began to assemble themselves in my mind in a way that now made sense. I understood more deeply why Oakland had felt like an incredibly bright and friendly place (in contrast to the vague sullenness I usually felt from the city) on the single day I&rsquo;d been driven around the city by a black neighbor I was helping, and all the blacks we dealt with were responding to him instead of to me, and so were open, happy, and friendly.</p>
<p>My memory is vague, but I think it still took me about a year of dropping by Amren (it somehow felt good to read the ventings of all the &#8220;racists&#8221;!  &mdash;  of whom I didn&rsquo;t yet consider myself as one!) before I began to see that there was real substance underneath the anger in the posts here, and then suddenly I was posting here myself, and after about a year or two of hanging out here and posting and reading seriously, my head and feelings were finally pretty clear.</p>

		<p>I had two awakenings: <br>
   1). Chancing upon the website &#8220;Stalking the Wild Taboo&#8221;. I found the idea of racial differences in IQ to be so fascinating, I just had to tell everyone. Knowing about IQ differences really explained a lot about the differences in the levels of civilization that exist all over the world. My father and I used to have discussions pondering this. Why did civilization develop in some parts of the world and not others? We were trying to focus on a climate link, for lack of anything else, because it never occurred to either of us that it was IQ! <br>
   2) The O.J. Simpson trial. When the verdict came in, and I saw all those jubilant blacks literally dancing with joy, I almost gasped. That was a true awakening. I just remember thinking, oh my God, they really aren&rsquo;t like us. Yeah, talk about your epiphany!  </p>

		<p>I was born in 1948 and grew up in a white culture until the sixties dawned and we began hearing about civil unrest and cities set on fire every summer by blacks. I had a few small incidents with blacks in my teens but didn&rsquo;t pay too much attention to my feelings about them. One day, when I was sixteen, I was driving to the hardware store to pick something up for my father when 100 or more blacks rushed into the street a short distance from where I was and linked arms to block my way. As I had grown up in rough neighborhoods, I had a very short temper and would fight for almost any reason but when I saw this travesty unveiling before my eyes I was incensed to a point beyond sanity. In an absolute rage I floored the gas pedal. As the car roared toward the blacks I could see the fear in their eyes and they scattered in every direction. I went to the hardware store and picked up the item my father had sent me for and turned around and went back home the same way I had come. All the blacks were gone. I didn&rsquo;t see a single one anywhere. I have no doubt I saved someones life that day. If I had been a white woman, I probably would have been raped and beaten to death. Think of your mother or sister or wife or girlfriend. These sort of provocations cannot be met with fear or dialogue. Still, surprisingly, this incident did not make me hate blacks though I did not like them. I went to Vietnam in 1966 and spent several years there fighting for God and country. While I was enduring my multiple tours of duty, fighting for what I thought was freedom and democracy, certain people in the States were complaining about too many blacks being killed in the war, so the powers that were came up with a creative solution. They started taking blacks away from combat areas and putting whites in their place to die instead, as though enough white guys were not dying already. This became a matter of policy. My anger towards blacks rose dramatically higher while my love for country and trust in the government took a nosedive from which I have never recovered. After 4 years of military service, 3 1/2 of which were spent overseas, I came home to the States to run smack into the brick wall of affirmative action, something of which I had never heard of before that time. I could not believe what I was hearing. I thought the military had made a mistake and had dropped me off in a foreign country. Surely, this could not be the United States. Is this what I had gone to war for? Had I been fighting for my own disenfranchisment? Had I gone to war in Vietnam to help bring freedoms to the Vietnamese people that my own government was taking away from me? What had happened to this country while I was away? The point of all this is that white people need to stand up and push back very aggressively when they themselves are pushed. People only do what they do because they think they can get away with it. The government does what it does because white people don&rsquo;t fight back. They flee to other areas. Eventually there will be no place left to flee to. Better to fight now and keep what you have then to have to try to regain it later.</p>

		<p>I was raised in the typical liberal family and was taught all races were equal. I gone through school with many blacks and never had a problem with them. I went to college and met a nice intelligent black man and we got married after college. I went to the doctors one day and we discover I was pregnant. That night we argued over having an abortion then we went to bed. When I woke up he wasnt their and his wedding ring was on the table. </p>
<p>I met a man from Nigeria and he was a well paided doctor. We got married and for two years we had an ideal marriage. I had two of his children and from their it went down hill. He began to be very abusive both verbally and physically. We sought out every form  of help to save our marriage but it ended in a divorce.</p>
<p>Now to this day I am stuck raising three kids by myself and I cant locate either of the fathers. Had I found AMREN earlier I wouldnt be in this predictament I&rsquo;m in now. Let my story be lesson learned and show this story to your daughters so they wont repeat what happend to me.</p>

		<p>In my experience only people who have had very little or no contact with blacks have a good impression of them. Anyone who is regularly EXPOSED to blacks and sees what they are REALLY like (as opposed to the Hollywood or TV version) can&rsquo;t help but see them in a bad light. </p>

		<p>I have worked many years in a government social worker type agency, dealing with convicted felons. </p>
<p>I was convinced that I was wrong, that the reason these blacks were criminals was lack of education or opportunity. My relevation was when I was finding them jobs and they would do nothing to better themselves. I literaly found jobs for them across the street from their homes, jobs just for the asking in good economic times, and they would not even cross the street to inquire. </p>
<p> I found my black co workers were no better. The clearest moment in my experience was the OJ verdict. Absolutely every black person, save one who did not participate, all got together in one meeting room, ordered pizza and glared at every white person passing by the glassed in doorway. They were in there from 11am, for the verdicts announcement in my area, and stayed separated like this for the rest of the day. They refused to speak to white people for the next two days or so. The (black) management not only let it go on, but participated, and directed the white/rest of us to continue our work!   That was precisely the moment I realized I dont owe any of these people a blessed thing.   While I still have to work with both clients and co workers of this ilk, I no longer invest any of myself in their success or failure. I am polite and professional, but my sympathy and support goes to my people alone.  To my surprise, by being fair and holding blacks accountable for their lack of progress has actually been met with positive feedback by my black co workers. </p>
<p> I dont hate any of these people. I merely see them for what they are, and treat them accordingly. I certainly hope they succeed, and help accordingly, but those destined to fail do so on their own, with no sympathy from me. </p>

		<p>Four years of anti-white propaganda at college did it for me, not to mention the personal verbal abuse I received daily from roommates, teachers, students, et cetera for being white.  What an insane nightmare it was!  I&rsquo;m so bitter from it, and I still have not recovered, don&rsquo;t know if I ever will recover. </p>

		<p>I remember growing up during the 1960&rsquo;s in a typical, liberal Jewish home in the Northeast.  Our family had a summer home on the New Jersey shore.  During the summer of 1967, at age 11, I think it was, we saw the movie &#8220;Guess Who&rsquo;s Coming to Dinner&#8221; about interracial marriage.  After the movie, at the Jersey shore, I remember my mother saying something like &#8220;In an intermarriage you can say to the children,&rsquo;Do you want to be a Jew or a Christian?&rsquo;&#8221; and saying something of how it is just not like that in an interracial marriage.  My parents were for Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement.  They let my eldest brother, my sister in the middle, and I date non-Jews, but certainly not blacks.</p>
<p>This I remember because during my adolesence, my parents would send me, on one Saturday night a month, to an inter-faith dance being held at a Presbyterian church, in an attempt to get me to have a social life.</p>
<p>Although, I have never married  or had children, my sister is married to a wonderful man of Ukrainian-Catholic backround, with two wonderful children.</p>
<p>As a teenager, I had some trouble with bad blacks, but I also personally knew some good blacks as well.  This was at a private high school for learning disablied youth.  During that time, I remember my parents would let me see R-rated movies, but were wise enough not to let me go into theaters showing &#8220;hate whitey&#8221; movies like &#8220;Shaft&#8221;, &#8220;Superfly&#8221; and &#8220;The Bus is Coming.&#8221;  Sometimes, I wonder if during that period of time in the early 1970&rsquo;s, there were naive, liberal, young white youths who foolishly went to those movies, only to get beaten up, robbed, raped, and otherwise be terrorized by the racist black audiences.</p>
<p>At this private high school for learning disabled youth, at the age of 14, I felt like a freak because I started having visible male-pattern baldness and a dermatologist said it was hereditary and nothing could be done about it.  It further upset and offended me when it was suggested that I get wig, an I idea considered even worse than the baldness.  This was in the early 1970&rsquo;s, long before the advent of monoxidil and rogaine.</p>
<p>I had not yet gotten my driver&rsquo;s license at the age of 18 and my mother was against it because of my coordination problems.  Fortunately, my father stepped and convinced my mother to let me learn to drive, so few months later, I finally got my driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>At this prep school, my classmates teased, tormented, and humiliated me over my baldness, not because I was going bald, but because I would not gracefully accept going bald.  They would ridicule me for trying to brush my remaining hair over my baldness.  Somehow, they just could not understand why I was deeply upset over going bald.</p>
<p>During this time at the prep school, I was too busy being an anti-semite over my baldness, coordination problems, and learning disabilities, to have any animosities toward blacks, or even notice the racial problems blacks cause.  This was not the case with my classmates.  They used the n-word to describe blacks all the time, both the Jewish and non-Jewish white students.  One of my classmates was good friends with a decent black person, who had just graduated from this prep school, had this  opinion on race and this is what he said &#8220;There is a black and there is a (n-word)&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I look back on those early years of my life, I now realize why my classmates at this prep school used the n-word all the time; they went to the local public schools, before going to this prep school.  Having gone to public school, they were well aware of racial realities and must have had bad experiences with blacks.  On the other hand, even though there some blacks at the private high school I went to, somehow I still was not really aware of the racial realties reported about at American Renaissance.</p>

		<p>My Awakening&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I was 19 years old&hellip;..I got sentenced to 10 years in prison&hellip;.(I worked a whole week for this company, under a sub-contractor and when pay-day came&hellip;..he spent EVERYBODYS money on drugs, so we were cut out of our money..so I went to his storage unit and stole some copper to &#8216;get&rsquo; what was owed to me&hellip;.4 spools of copper, nothing more)&hellip;..anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>The authorities were &#8216;interviewing&rsquo; everyone on the crew about the theft&hellip;.I told them hell yeah I done it&hellip;.he owed all of us money for the week before and noone got any money for our services&hellip;that all I got was 4 spools of copper&hellip;.nothing more&hellip;</p>
<p>Well&hellip;..since it was at 11:30 at night they charged me with this &#8216;midnight burglary&#8221; thing&hellip;..and gave me 10 years&hellip;</p>
<p>I completely fell out!!&hellip;.I could not believe it!!&hellip;</p>
<p>I went to a place in Georgia called Alto&hellip;..in 1989&hellip;..the ratio was 90% American-african&hellip;and 8% American-American..and a few hispanics&hellip;..</p>
<p>I found that they are loud, stupid&hellip;and they hate Whites (American-Americans)&hellip;..the majority (99%)of them are gay (they would wrap up with eachother like they were boyfriend and girlfriend with blankets provided by the state, drink hot cocoa and eat cookies..and THEN&hellip;.go to visitation and act all macho while holding their children and kissing all over their wife, girlfriend, prostitute, sister)&hellip;.</p>
<p>Youve heard that saying &#8220;Fly on the wall&#8221;??&hellip;..well, I was the &#8220;Cracker in the hall&#8221;&hellip;.and Ive heard things that were so evil&hellip;as to what they wanted to do to Whites&hellip;.strictly for being White&hellip;..noother reason&hellip;.and they literally hate White Women&hellip;.thats why they rape them&hellip;&hellip;.that, and to &#8216;disrespect&rsquo; White Men&hellip;..</p>
<p>I had to fight&hellip;.fight more&hellip;.and more&hellip;..</p>
<p>Blacks can never be assimilated into a civil society&hellip;they will NEVER excel above a 5th grader&hellip;..theyre too stupid and the Whites that believe otherwise&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;are the true enemies&hellip;</p>
<p>Im seeing more and more of that &#8216;prison&rsquo; attitude out here in the free-world&hellip;.more and more American-africans that carry that &#8216;hate Whitey&rsquo; sticker on their foreheads.<br>

		<p>WE all should heed Lisa&rsquo;s story. It is typical of our White women far too often today.</p>
<p> Lisa, you married not one, but TWO different black men? WHY? After the first one why did you marry the second one? Did you ever date any White men? I am not admonishing you, I am just curious as to why you dated black men in the first place? Now you have their children to raise alone. Were you ever racially aware or did you fall for the &#8220;we are all the same&#8221; propaganda that has all but destroyed our race? Did you not know the reputation of blacks all over the world?  Did you read all the news about black behavior and their crimes? </p>
<p>Hope you answer and I hope you don&rsquo;t take offense at my questions. We, as a race, have to take back what has been lost.</p>

		<p>I was raised in Marxist, I hate America, Vestal New York. I was placed in AP type classes where the commie brainwashing was intense. As a result, I was trained to think that &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221;. Of course, there were NO blacks around to test that theory against. </p>
<p>When I was a freshman in high school, my parents moved to Tampa, Florida. I lived on the wealthy peninsula attending all-white H.B. Plant High school. The school had an excellent reputation for academics. My very first exposure to &#8220;black culture&#8221; occurred when I was on the frosh basketball team and we traveled to the projects to play an all-black, Division II high school. I couldn&rsquo;t believe were we at a high school, the building looked like a bombed out WWII hulk, with garbage and filth everywhere. As our all-white team entered the gym, the crowd went nuts, throwing all kinds of stuff at us, call us &#8220;honky mother******&hellip;&#8221; and other pleasantries The game was a nightmare. The first time I took the ball out on the sidelines (the crowd was seated within inches of the paint) someone reached from behind me and punched me in the testicles. I fell over in pain and had to leave the game. The ref came over and asked me what happened, when I told him, he just turned away without saying anything.</p>
<p>Two years later, a Yankee Federal Judge, ordered the de-segregation of the Tampa school system via busing. The very first day of school, I was riding my bike to Plant and noticed a plume of smoke near the school. As I got to the main entrance, a Florida patrolman turned me back saying &#8220;no school today, go home.&#8221; Turns out, within minutes of getting off their busses, the blacks set fire to the cafeteria! We all had a two week school start vacation. The next two years were total chaos. I could write a book on the day-to-day experiences with armed robbery in the bathrooms, books thrown thru glass doors on classroom&hellip;my younger brother and I began to carry knives all the time. I kept a baseball bat and .22 pistol in my car. The dean of boys, a retired Marine Corps gunnery sgt, told me that he was quitting because &#8220;I am tired of going to court with the NAACP to get 23 year male, ex-cons expelled from the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>My next exposure to blacks was in the Air Force. When I got off the bus at Lackland AFB, by the luck of the draw, I was put into a training squadron with 37 blacks, all from the same East St. Louis Illinois ghetto. Turns out they were all sentenced by the same judge. My most vivid basic training memory occurred when one of their girlfiends sent a letter embedded with multiple hits of LSD. As soon as I got wind of this, I made my bunk, then crawled underneath it. As the drug took effect, they got louder and louder and began throwing chairs all over the dorm room. I heard the dorm door slam open followed by multiple drill instructors and security policeman. They eventually cleared the dorm with night-sticks and cuffs, but they punished the entire training group by setting us back a full month. Even that did not help as the remaining blacks became even more crazy. Eventually, they replaced both of the white DIs with two black DIs, one of which was 6 foot 6 and 270 pounds. This enforcer eventually got us through basic, with an attrition rate of over 50%. My only saving grace in the military was that I was an avionics technician and they still had hardcore pre-requisites to get into that training. In four years I never again encountered a black in the flight line computer shops and the avionics squadron dorms were all white too.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 years I have had multiple, violent encounters with blacks. When my children were younger, they had a trampoline in the back yard. At the time we were living in an all-white suburb of Seattle. The kids were all bouncing on the trampoline when I heard one of my daughters scream. I rushed outside to see a large, flaming object on the trampoline. I pulled it off and extinguished it with the hose. I asked what happened and my terrified daughter said those boys over there threw it over the fence at us. I turned to see two black boys, maybe 12-13 years old in the alley behind the house. I jumped the fence and they immediately bolted to a new apartment complex down the alley. I ran and followed them as they ran into an apartment. I pounded on the door but no one answered. I returned home and called the police. They came and also pounded on the door to no avail. Long story short, the Feds built this NEW apartment complex to house section-8 welfare clients and it was now stocked with ghetto families from Seattle&rsquo;s Raineer district. The two boys had approached my kids demanding that they come through the fence and use the trampoline. When my girls said no, they got a rolled up newspaper, set it on fire and tossed on the trampoline full of kids. Eventually, the police got into the apartment. The whole time, both the boys and their two single-mothers were home. The police ended up arresting the women as the apartment was full of drugs and stolen property.</p>
<p>My kids are all grown now and I raised them with a total awareness of &#8220;people of color&#8221;. If either of my daughters have to go to Seattle, or God forbid Tacoma, their purses are always equipped with a .45 auto.  My son lives in Denver and he too always takes the necessary precautions if he must enter a Mexican or black area.</p>

<p>#9, I found the same thing in the U.S. after 3 1/2 years LRRP in Cambodia, Laos and N. Viet Nam BUT!!! an even bigger difference after 5 years involved in OIF/OEF I find my country over run with muslims and BLACK muslims..A difference between the beach head the muslims and blacks have here compared to the one the Allies had on the Normandy Beaches, is that we Whites control ALL of the logistics and gravy train supply routes,,,we need to STOP THE TRAIN.</p>

		<p>Living in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada&rsquo;s third largest metropolis, was the catalyst for my racial awakening. Prior to that, I&rsquo;d soaked up all the multicultural and leftist propaganda shoved down my throat in both public school and at university. But it took being a white minority to realize I&rsquo;d better take some pride in who I was as a white man. Once whites are the minority, they are not treated with any respect by those non-whites who are now the majority. And that includes prosperous non-whites, such as the Hong Kong immigrants who dominated Vancouver. These were law-abiding, home-owning, and determined to get a good education type folks, but their scorn for white people was both shocking and abysmal. I can only imagine what it would have been like for me living in a city where the majority population was black.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was the realization that non-whites will never treat a minority white population with anything even remotely approaching basic respect that did it for me.</p>

		<p>I grew up a baby boomer in an all-white town.  Like all baby boomers, I grew up watching TV.  Numerous shows dealt with the same story line:  A nonwhite comes to town.  Evil, bigoted whites are unhappy about this and are unjustly suspicious of the nonwhite.  (The only &#8220;good&#8221; whites are the series regulars, who defend and stand up for the nonwhite.)  The nonwhite is falsely accused of some crime.  With much dignity, the nonwhite bravely endures the abuse directed at him/her by stupid, racist whites.  And of course, it always turned out that the nonwhite was innocent and that some horrible white person had actually committed the crime.  The lesson was clear:  Nonwhites were superior to whites.  Only stupid, bigoted, jealous whites thought otherwise.  &#8220;Good&#8221; whites were willing to accept their inferiority, but there would always be some stubborn, hateful whites who would still insist on disliking nonwhites and saying insensitive things, and these whites were the most horrible people on earth. </p>
<p>Well, these TV shows were all I knew about blacks, so when my family moved to the inner city of Chicago, I looked forward to the opportunity of going to school with wonderful black people!  </p>
<p>Shortly before I started at my high school, the students and teachers at that time, (all white) had protested and picketed to get a new building and equipment.  And they had succeeded.  The building was brand new and ultramodern.  Well, blacks immediately complained that it &#8220;wasn&rsquo;t fair&#8221; that whites got to go to such a nice new school.  They demanded that the school boundaries be changed so that more blacks could go to the school; otherwise, they&rsquo;d riot.  Each year, the boundaries were expanded so that more and more blacks could attend the fancy new school building  &mdash;   the one that white students and teachers had picketed and protested and worked to obtain.</p>
<p>By my senior year, the school was about 50% black.  Whites were jumped and beaten just for walking down the hall.  White girls were not allowed to use the restrooms or try out for cheeleader, or they&rsquo;d be beaten.  Black kids stole from whites and demanded whites hand over their possessions.  Blacks pushed whites&rsquo; food trays to the floor in the cafeteria, then demanded the whites cleam up the mess.  The principal and teachers sided with the blacks out of fear.  The blacks were given everything they demanded, while whites were told to shut up, give in, and not antagonize them.  Blacks loved setting off the fire alarms, forcing everybody to evacuate and go outside in the freezing Chicago weather.  Blacks rioted on a regular basis.  All the good teachers got disgusted and ended up leaving.  Normal teenage activities like proms, clubs and dances were simply not possible at my school.  Learning was not possible.  It was all about making it through the day alive, and suffering through the four years just so you wouldn&rsquo;t have the stigma of being a &#8220;high school dropout.&#8221; </p>
<p>I often wondered what those former students and teachers thought, the ones who had picketed and protested to get the brand-new building.  Because by the time I left, you&rsquo;d never know the building was only four years old.  It was a dump.</p>
<p>After I finally graduated from that hellhole, I spoke to a white girl who was one year behind me.  The school had gotten so bad by that time that no white female was safe walking across the courtyard.  White girls had their cousins, fathers, etc. meet them after school and walk them across.</p>
<p>I recently looked up the school to see if it still existed.  It&rsquo;s 100% black.  The school now has a fancy &#8220;Academy&#8221; name, probably some liberal&rsquo;s idea to help the &#8220;self-esteem&#8221; of the &#8220;students.&#8221;  I see the school now has a daycare center on site.</p>
<p>Those four years of high school taught me everything I needed to know about blacks, and since then, my opinion has not improved.  Not that I haven&rsquo;t met *some* nice blacks.  But far too many are a problem.  I&rsquo;ve had black coworkers who were loud and lazy, coming in to work whenever they felt like it and doing little or no work, while white employees were expected to work hard and be on time.  I&rsquo;ve seen dumb white women who married black men, only to have those black men cheat on them, openly and blatantly flirting with their wives&rsquo; white girlfriends.  I, and numerous of my friends, have been robbed or our property vandalized, and it&rsquo;s been a black perp every time.  </p>
<p>I live in fear of getting into an auto accident with a black.  One time a drunken black wandered into the road outside my apartment building and a white male driver, (a doctor,) couldn&rsquo;t avoid hitting him.  Immediately the poor doctor&rsquo;s car was surrounded by a mob of screaming, angry blacks, claiming that the racist driver had purposely run into a black.  Fortunately, a white man who lived in my building happened to see the whole incident and was able to be a witness for the doctor.</p>
<p>Like other baby boomers, I often get e-mails forwarded to me saying things like, &#8220;Remember the good old days, when we didn&rsquo;t have to lock our doors, and as kids, we could go play outside?!&#8221;  Everybody likes to forward those e-mails, but nobody dares express WHY our country isn&rsquo;t like that anymore!  Bottom line:  It&rsquo;s blacks and Hispanics.  The amount of crime in a neighborhood is in direct proportion to the amount of blacks and/or Hispanics living there.  If it weren&rsquo;t for immigration and welfare, we&rsquo;d still have that wonderful country where there was hardly any crime and you didn&rsquo;t have to lock your doors.  We had it, but we stupidly, foolishly, tragically threw it away.</p>

		<p>A different twist on racial awakening.  I was born in 1965 to a European-immigrant father and a mom from a traditional American family.  Ideas of going to a non-white school or marrying non –whites were so ridiculous that they were hardly mentioned.</p>
<p>However, my mom became a hippie and lauded my plans to study an exotic foreign language in college.  After graduating with a minor in Chinese I went to Taiwan to sharpen my skills to prepare for high-level work as a translator.  I started translation work about a year and a half into my 3 year stay there. Thus began my awareness that the future of the white race was truly in jeopardy.</p>
<p>East Asians are quite different from the stereotype presented by the mainstream media.  Definitely not the &ldquo;Bell-Curve&rdquo; genius sort that many on here seem to subscribe to.  There is a plethora of all types of crime; sexual crimes toward white women tourists are rampant.  Highest IQ? Please.  For every bright Asian there are thousands upon thousands of barely average to dull ones.  A third world people with a third world society.  </p>
<p>Worst of all they are very keen on immigration to white countries and miscegenation with whites. To them, a white spouse or half-white child is the ultimate prize to wow your friends with.  If an Asian makes good money the first high status trophy to obtain is citizenship papers to a white nation.  In my work I was approached daily by Asian women begging me to set them up with white men and people trying to get me to falsify paperwork to get them into white colleges.  I worked for a company that helped Chinese students get into grad programs in the US.  Many of these, um, &ldquo;high IQ&rdquo; students went on to flunk out of these American schools.  But it was their weird, unnatural drive to race-mix with whites and immigrate that shocked me into giving up my profession and rejecting non-whites in white countries.  Massive Asian immigration would spell genocide for whites.</p>
<p>Today I am mother to three white children.  I cannot fathom looking into the face of my grandchild and seeing the face of China, Japan, Korea, Africa, India etc there instead of a continuation of my white family.   Doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo; mean  to &ldquo;produce again&rdquo;?  To that end, a mixed grandchild would be more of death than a life, the end of our gene line.  Yet it is demanded that whites not only accept this as an eventuality, but joyfully embrace it.</p>
<p>Often I am disturbed by some of the opinions of &ldquo;race-realist&rdquo; types like Steve Sailor, Peter Brimlow et al.  While they readily admit the problems with blacks, Mexicans and muslims their writings suggest that they are willing to basically give away the (white) farm to legal immigrant Asians.  Is the issue for them (and some others) merely high crime, low performance and IQ of NAMs?  The news flash is that they have been hoodwinked about Asians.  Asians cannot produce a white country, that&rsquo;s why they immigrate here by the millions and seek intermarriage.  Quite a lot I have posed this question to the cult of Asian worshipers:   Why, if these people are indeed more intelligent than us, is it that we whites have produced the most desirable society and highest standard of living?  I mean, the direction of east-west immigration is about 100% Far East to White West.  None of the Asiaphiles seem to want to debate the topic. </p>
<p>Down to brass tacks though. Debates on Asian intelligence or performance really just detract from the core issue.  The real point is that whites as a distinct race have a right to exist, and the immigration of any alien race regardless of who they are threatens our survival.  Is race-realism about giving away the West to whoever is perceived to be the highest IQ invader or is it about preservation of our own?<br>

		<p>Anonymous 9:02PM,  I&rsquo;ve seen many answers to your questions. I came to the conclusion that I didn&rsquo;t have the necessary academic background to try to answer the deep questions about the white condition. Instead I decided to support white organizations and let them deal with the questions. I do some missionary work for these organizations by introducing whites to what is available. There&rsquo;s AmRen of course and you can find others in the links section here. I&rsquo;m cautious about who I approach because I&rsquo;d like to avoid confrontations, especially with neighbors and people at work. A few times a week I&rsquo;ll visit a bar or lunch counter and I&rsquo;ve found that is a way to meet people. There have been few nasty situations but sometimes a good connection can be made. </p>

		<p>Some context here: I&rsquo;m Jewish, was born in 1949, and lived in nice white neighborhoods in Los Angeles.  My parents were not into all this multi-culti stuff, and my mother had a rather harsh tone in her voice when she used the term &#8220;schvartzer&#8221; (Yiddish for black male), but open bigotry was not expressed.</p>
<p>I maintained an open mind as there was little to sway me in another direction. The black men who worked for my father were always well-mannered, and one or two of them were just crazy about my brother and me.</p>
<p>(keep in mind: this was pre-LBJ and his family-destroying &#8220;Great Society&#8221;)</p>
<p>School? Almost entirely white from K to 12. In fact, my high school had, probably, 20 non-Jews.  It was, quite literally, Portnoy&rsquo;s Complaint West.</p>
<p>One summer at a YMCA camp, I encountered quite a few blacks. Mostly poor, from Watts. Virtually all of them were darn good guys. Different? Yes. But most were kind, decent, and a heck of a lot of fun.  </p>
<p>One stood out, though.  Trashy mouth, pushy, STUPID, and noisy. The other black campers really wanted nothing to do with him; each time he opened his mouth you could SEE how embarrassed they were.  About the only friend he had was a whiny, ghetto-talk counselor who found reason to complain about just about everything. (Another black counselor, Eddie, was a big brown-bear of a man who was laid back, kind, intelligent, and who had no time for either Camper Trashmouth or for Counselor Whine. And I detected NO racial issues with the man).</p>
<p>So, based on my experiences, the open mind remained. It remained through my time in the service even though I did serve with blacks.  The particular job I had required brains and a quick wits (radio intercept, crypto-analysis, etc) so the affirmative action placements did not last much beyond A-school. </p>
<p>The shift toward my being racially aware came in the last year of my Navy service. A black Chief Petty Officer in my division was openly racist, but I dealt him a hand he had a hard time playing. Trust me: it cost him dearly. At least back then, the Naval Security Group did not have time for this nonsense.  The other blacks? They hated his guts.</p>
<p>The awareness continues. I work in the field of industrial and commercial lighting, with my specialty being energy conservation.  This means I work a lot of projects for energy management companies that hold performance contracts with school districts, municipalities, and with prison systems.</p>
<p>The settling in to my awakening came with with survey work I conducted in the Los Angeles Unified School District. I went into, roundly speaking, 35 to 40 schools over a several-week period.  I encountered a lot of open hostility not just from the black students, but from black administrative staff and teachers. Rude, arrogant, loud, and hardly a one of them could compose a grammatically correct sentence if their lives depended on it. Vulgar language was included in the mix as well. Oddly enough, I got NONE of this sort of thing from either TRULY educated blacks.</p>
<p>The neighborhoods themselves were appalling.  The loud music, the trash in the streets, sidewalk fights, and the manner in which people drove was a sight to behold.  </p>
<p>The race hustlers often complain about traffic stops for &#8220;driving while black&#8221;.  Nope. The reality is, they are stopped for &#8220;driving LIKE a black&#8221;, a term given me by a friend who is a cop. And black. DLaB is purposeful recklessness, almost daring you to hit them, and hatred in their eyes while doing it. And they do it to each other!  </p>
<p>Trust me: this big, red-bearded honkey in his pickup truck made darn sure he was on the freeway and well on his way back to Ventura County by no later than 3PM each day when having to work in areas like that. The city fathers in LA frown on self-defense, so it was discretion, not fear.</p>
<p>To this day, I maintain as open a mind as I can. For example, I listen to a lot of black musicians, but most of them are long-dead of natural causes. They were GOOD musicians, so the skin tone means nothing to me. But when it comes to real live everyday living, I go my way and let them go theirs.  I do not shop in stores that have a high percentage of black clientele. I avoid their parts of town.</p>
<p>But if forced to deal with them and they cause me problems I darn well speak up. Example: I did not accept &#8220;attitude&#8221; from a black nurse when I was in the hospital for surgery. I demanded that the floor manager fix the situation or I would take it higher up. The problem was solved.</p>

		<p>The so-called women&rsquo;s movement was really invented to divide and conquer whites.  Turning white women against white men was a key ingredient to tearing down our culture.</p>
<p>The man-hating feminists are predominantly white women.  Latino women, by and large, are absent from the women&rsquo;s movement.  Judge Sotomayer, for instance, is not anti-male in general, she is anti-white male.  She is very supportive of her own race as she is a member of La Raza, and she will be very supportive of Latino men in general.</p>
<p>And black women can&rsquo;t stand white women, unless the white women are joining them in denigrating whites in general.  This was demonstrated in the O.J. trial.  The prosecution naively thought having many females on the jury would be a good thing  &mdash;  even though every jury consultant tried to tell the prosecution that focus groups show black females are hostile towards white women in general and they will likely be less sympathetic towards white victims.</p>

		<p>When ghetto blacks first started moving into my Minneapolis suburb is when I started to realize blacks are not like they are portrayed in old civil rights march footage and entertainment media.</p>
<p>My first crystal clear realization that the media was explicitly anti-white was the Rodney King affair. That they purposely edited and looped the tape to make it look like an innocent black being beaten by abusive police officers floored me in its dishonesty and evil. When in reality it was a case of a raging violent felon resisting arrest. And the rest of the video showed as much but was kept from the public. As a result, dozens of people were murdered after the acquittal.</p>
<p>The reaction to the O.J. verdict was the last straw. This showed me that even the &#8216;good ones&rsquo; would close ranks with the worst of them and celebrate the cold blooded murder of whites. Now, to me there is no categorizing good blacks and bad blacks, all of them are just blacks - to be treated with a high degree of caution and suspicion. </p>

<p>When were you in the AF?  Because I&rsquo;m not a big fan of redundancies, and to me, &#8220;East St. Louis ghetto&#8221; is a redundancy.  I&rsquo;m guessing it was quite awhile ago, and if so, it was probably in the final years of ESL having a significant white population.  It was 75% white 25% black in 1960, but down to 10% white 90% black in 1970.</p>

		<p>Hello, </p>
<p>I want to share my story on how I &#8220;woke up&#8221;, so to say. </p>
<p>I was raised by both parents: a Scots-Irish-Cherokee, white, Southern-descended father who attended a Baptist church. </p>
<p>My mother was a Nordic princess: German-Norwegian descent from the upper Midwest, and a Lutheran. </p>
<p>Both of my brothers were my &#8220;dad&rsquo;s boys&#8221;, they loved NASCAR, hunting, gun ranges, gambling, wild parties, conservative Republican politics, patriotism and rodeos. </p>
<p>As for myself, I followed my mom&rsquo;s family line: I was a bookworm, took my studies seriously, went to college, dabbled in Wicca and other New Age spiritual practices, was fascinated by art, science and history. Had a passion for helping others and voted Democrat quite often. I was your typical, Nordic Yankee. </p>
<p>It was in my Northern, Yankee side that I found a home. Also, I did my best to live up to that stereotype by taking an egalitarian view on race, like my mother once had, and bemoaning the &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;prejudice&#8221; of my father and brothers and their detestable, redneck Southern mentality.</p>
<p>Well, needless to say, both my mother and I were mugged in a parking lot by two armed blacks, where we had everything stolen. They left my Mom alone but they cursed me, called me &#8220;f  &mdash;   cracker&#8221; and every other horribel name you could think of.</p>
<p>It was probably the biggest wake-up call I&rsquo;d ever had and I was 23 years old. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can answer it, but I can scratch the surface.  Or at least I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>#1. It&rsquo;s taken a little at a time, nibble by nibble, over a period of years so that we hardly notice the slight differences (at the time).</p>
<p>#2. We&rsquo;re all scared for our reputations and our jobs. We don&rsquo;t want to become known as bigots or racists. We don&rsquo;t want to lose our friends or our jobs or be snubbed in our neighborhood. The other side has all the propaganda sewed up, and anyone who opposes them is branded as a bigot if not an outright psycho.</p>
<p>#3.  We&rsquo;re lazy. It&rsquo;s a natural tendency to wait for somebody else to come along and fix the problem.  We&rsquo;ve been waiting for many years now and most of us are STILL waiting. In the meantime, the TV  keeps us hypnotized with celebrity news, sports, sit-coms, and day-to-day local nonsense.</p>
<p>Then some day we wake up, look around, and realize that we didn&rsquo;t vote for this! We didn&rsquo;t expect any of this!  We didn&rsquo;t plan for the world to turn out this way! But that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>Well, how&rsquo;s that for a start?</p>

		<p>One thing that I cannot emphasize enough is that if you are a parent to get your kids out of public school immediatly. If your kids are young you will be able to repair the damage but if they are older then you will have more damage to repair from multi-cultural teaching liberals. If you absolutely have to put your children in public schools then stay away from schools that have words like &#8220;magnet&#8221; or &#8220;academy&#8221; in the name of the school, these are just buzz words for trying to raise test scores by attracting white students from other districts by offering classes or programs that are not availible in other schools. Most of these schools are in very poor or predominantly black neighborhoods that might not even be safe for parents picking up or dropping off children or worse for high school students that might be driving back and forth. It is especially critical to get white kids, especially girls away from blacks starting around the 3rd grade, it is a proven fact that blacks hit puberty early and with black kids being held back at a higher rate it is possible for kids who are 10-11 years old to be in the 3rd or 4th grade and to look and act much older than a comparable white 3rd or 4th grader who is still a couple of years from puberty. I was always told that it was unacceptable for me to bring home black friends or date a black boy but when I ended up going to schools that were more than about 10% black it was always a disaster. Even when there were less than the tipping point, there was always a wise acre who joked, screamed and cut up in class so that nobody would learn anything. </p>
<p>You can do research online about the schools in your area to determine the racial makeup, this works for private as well as public schools. I would homeschool if it is at all possible, that way you are in control of what your children are learning 100% of the time. If you have the means or can secure a scholarship then a private school is a good way to have more control over what your child is learning if you cannot homeschool. Remember the multi-cultural teachings are still being taught in schools that are 100% white so make sure that kids understand that there are racial differences and that even though blacks are people with human rights and dignity that does not mean that we have to be best friends with or even associate with them other than is business or very casual ways. </p>

		<p>I, too, was brought up in a family that was, and still is, race naive. As a kid i had no contact with blacks until i was in my teens and, at that time, were something of a novelty. My racial awakening began when I started to see past the liberal media bias to figure out for myself. How the media shapes ideas! Blacks have it good in the US but they cannot coexist with other races. They should have their own country so they can mess is up and leave whites alone so they may continue to prosper.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m told that ideologically, most private schools are not much better.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing that there are laws that prevent home schoolers from also taking in a couple of children from those who cannot home school.</p>

		<p>I was born in the South at the tail end of Jim Crow.  In my town, they closed down the black schools and spent massive amounts of money adding on to the white schools in order to accomodate the influx of blacks once their schools were closed and integration achieved.</p>
<p>Before the blacks came, our schools were safe and there was only an occasional scuffle between students.  On the third day of my freshman year (which was the year ALL the blacks started at my high school), we had a knifing.  One black stabbed another.  This was unheard of in my small town of 6,500.</p>
<p>I went through a phase where I used to think my parents were bigots and racists and would debate them about the way they thought.  Little did I realize, they were trying to give me some street smarts.  Once I got out on my own and began working and living in the real world, I saw blacks and hispanics in a completely different light.</p>
<p>I have not seen any area of the city I reside in where it&rsquo;s improved, gotten nicer, safer, and cleaner once they become the majority.  Most are infantile, rude, low class, loud, boisterous, disrespectful, indolent, and not the brightest crayons in the box.</p>
<p>America is now sliding down towards the abyss of becoming a third world nation.  Most of the minorities think things will be peachy once they get control of things and teach whitey a thing or two.  But they better realize this.  Once the geese are gone who are laying the golden eggs, life as they now know it will cease to exist.  Most of them are not intelligent enough to comprehend this.</p>

<p>The Globalist Bankster Elite want to destroy American civilization and submerge this country into a neo-feudalistic One World Government which they rule over.  Cities full of economically independent, well educated, religious Middle-class Whites was their biggest obstacle.   Forced racial integration was and is one their greatest weapons and the outstanding results are cataloged on AR and elsewhere. But realize the Herculean effort behind this undertaking:  Tens of billions spent on 24/7/365 pro-diversity propaganda from the corporate media and unrelenting negative coverage of &#8220;racists&#8221;.  Years spent to takeover education at all levels from Kindegarten thru University to brainwash every young person to hate those who doubt diversity. Trillions spent to move non-whites into white areas and sustain them there.  Corrupting the justice system to give criminal minorities license to commit mayhem.  Twisting the law to promote non-whites and their integration and to persecute those who object to it. Using the awesome and limitless might of the Federal Government, its courts, and its armed forces, to mercilessly and viscously crush any group or individual that dares resist. When faced with all that,  driven by a power and a purpose they don&rsquo;t understand, its  no wonder why most folks just meekly submit.</p>

<p>Wherever there are these kind of racial problems in the world, this is where the media will focus on the hatred and bigotry (of whites). Wherever these is the most affirmative action, this is where the official policy will be that it is whites who are discriminating, and it&rsquo;s wrong, and evil. The late Sam Francis called this &#8216;Anarcho-Fascism&rsquo;. The more depraved non-whites become, the more the authorities crack down on white folks.<br>

<p>While I certainly don&rsquo;t mean to disagree with Spartan  (and  I  don&rsquo;t disagree), I also have to wonder what effect this will have on the kids. It seems that either way, public school or homeschooling, there will be adverse effects.   (Oh, and btw, it&rsquo;s not just public school;  parochial or private schools will still promote multiculturalism, will they not?)</p>
<p>What I mean is that we are all part of our surrounding society and have no choice but to function within it.  Eventually, those kids will have get out in the larger world and earn a living.  Won&rsquo;t a homeschooled education produce children who are culturally disconnected with the world around them if they don&rsquo;t share the same values, beliefs, outlooks, and cultural interests?   Won&rsquo;t they be regarded as strange people with bizarre, crazy views by the rest of the people they will have to associate with?    For example, if you don&rsquo;t know who Michael Jackson is,  or Beyonce, or  LLCoolJ, etc.,  or  breakdancing or hiphop, many people will view you as sort of a freak &hellip;  where have you been all your life?   And if you don&rsquo;t share in the worshipful adulation of Martin Luther King, you&rsquo;ll be viewed as not only stupid but downright immoral.  A dinosaur!   If you&rsquo;re not up on the latest sitcoms or basketball scores or So-&-So&rsquo;s latest recording/video, you&rsquo;re culturally out of touch with the world around you.   </p>
<p>One of the posters here said that he doesn&rsquo;t watch TV and doesn&rsquo;t even have any;  but when his co-workers learn of this they look at him like he&rsquo;s from another planet!   I can understand that because  he&rsquo;s living in a different world than they are.  A world that they can&rsquo;t imagine. They wonder what&rsquo;s  &#8220;wrong&#8221;  with him. </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to make your home and earn your living in China, Brazil, France, wherever, you need to have some understanding and connection to the  culture around you.   Same here in the US.  Otherwise, you&rsquo;re  a fish out of water  -  an oddity. Life will only be more difficult for you.   Sad but true.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s good to vent and swap stories about how we each came to our present way of thinking about blacks.  Since most of us agree on the problems it&rsquo;s time for ideas regarding solutions.<br>
 <br>
One poster mentioned that it&rsquo;s far too late for meaningful political actions.   Probably correct.  However, I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re at the point yet where it&rsquo;s time for every man-jack to lookout for himself and head for the bunker.  There&rsquo;s a political way out, albeit a tough one.  And it will take convincing lot of white people to cross the Rubicon. <br>
 <br>
The only real political solution is secession for racial separation.  This could be done peacefully.  Most white people will complain but will be too comfortable and apathetic to take the leap. Most won&rsquo;t support it.  </p>
<p>Any such movement will need to come from the younger generations because the older ones are too hooked into the system for life support.  But looking at the vote results for 2008 we have a long way to go with the younger crowd.  It&rsquo;s possible whites will simply fade away as the once great United States collapses into tribalism, anarchy, and ruin.  </p>
<p>Results show that 52 percent of white males in California voted for the Kenyan in 2008. True the alternative wasn&rsquo;t pretty (except for the VP candidate), but opposition must start somewhere.   </p>
<p>Here is what the white male supporters of the Kenyan will get, after his third or perhaps forth term.</p>
<p>1.Outright quotas for blacks and other minorities</p>
<p>2.Increased taxes to pay for undisguised reparations to blacks</p>
<p>3.Increased taxes to pay for additional care of illegals (schools, health etc)</p>
<p>4.Blue collar salaries driven to minimum wage by hordes of illegal job seekers </p>
<p>5.Gun control.  The 2nd amendment hinges by a one vote thread among the supreme dorks. </p>
<p>6.Hate crime laws that punish whites for political expression</p>
<p>7.Laws to make it a crime to speak ill of a congress member</p>
<p>8.Taxes on achievers to spread funds to the ghettos to keep them from blowing up</p>
<p>9.Concessions to Sharia law which has already happened in some cities of the US.</p>
<p>10.Sons pushed out of college for a favored minority less qualified</p>
<p>11.Daughters pressured into sleeping with blacks</p>
<p>12.Brownouts or blackouts because no power plants will be constructed.   </p>
<p>13.Gas shortages because of the ban on domestic energy production.</p>
<p>14.Cars that are more like riding lawn mowers</p>
<p>To you white boys in California who voted for the Keyan, have fun in the new hell you helped create.  And I hope you enjoy your new found forth rate citizenship status.  As long as a large minority of the white male voters insists on cooperating in their own demise, there is little hope in the political sense.   </p>
<p>Over the past many years I&rsquo;ve crisscrossed the country many times traveling for my business.  It almost never failed that I would end up in the hotel bar to witness crowds of future white male Kenyan voters sitting around watching football, basketball, or other ghetto sports, hugging their beers and cheering for their favorite black thug players.  Disgustingly, some of these white males would be wearing the jersey of their favorite black &ldquo;hero.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>How many on this forum would openly support a secessionist effort to separate the races?    <br>

		<p>&#8220;The so-called women&rsquo;s movement was really invented to divide and conquer whites. Turning white women against white men was a key ingredient to tearing down our culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with this at all. White women don&rsquo;t hate White men. Actually, more of the reverse is true.</p>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t say I had an awakening as dramatic as many of you.  Mine came in degrees.  The blacks I&rsquo;d known as a child were our servants and field hands.  So of course they were as nice to me as they could be.  Then, I went to college (in the early seventies) with them, assumed I could be friends with them, and was viewed with either amusement or mild contempt.  </p>
<p>Then, not far out of college, I bought an apartment building in a town that was going black.  I thought the town was gentrifying, since a nearby metropolis was growing in its direction, and there was a large stock of fine old homes there.  No such luck.  Blacks were murdering old people in their homes, robbing and attacking in the ways that have been described countless times on Amren.  I thought I could flip the building, but instead spent fifteen years trying to sell it.  In all those years, I got not one serious offer.  All because of the steadily growing percentage of blacks in the town.  Finally, I sold for half what I&rsquo;d paid for the place (less than a quarter, once inflation was taken into account.</p>
<p>After that, I entered internet searches like &#8216;whitest place in America&rsquo;.  I wanted to get as far away from blacks and the poverty they create as I could.  Finally, those searches led to Vdare, which led me to American Renaissance.  Well, I&rsquo;ve learned there isn&rsquo;t anywhere to run.  Not yet.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t really put my finger on when I had an &#8220;awakening&#8221;, because I haven&rsquo;t really mixed with many blacks.  I&rsquo;ve always felt uncomfortable around them, hate the way they talk, the way they walk, the way that every conversation always comes round to race.I hate the way that every black person that I see is bellowing into a mobile phone clamped to their ear.  I&rsquo;ve tried having black friends, but even the most intelligent ones show their true colours after a while, usually by manifesting some kind of psychotic or antisocial behaviour. What I hate most of all, is that these traits, and you all know exactly what I mean, have filtered down into society in general.   No one now takes responsibility for anything, no one will just put their hands up and say &#8220;sorry, I was wrong&#8221;, they have to argue the toss with you about the most trivial thing.  Violence is quite often the first resort, everyone knows their rights, but not their responsibilities.There seems to be no shame in having several illigitimate kids by different fathers and living on benefits.  And the more I blacks I see, and there are more and more infesting this formerly majority white city I live in, the more I hate them. I&rsquo;ve tried to educate friends about this but the answer is always &#8220;but you cant generalise, we&rsquo;re all human&#8221;, or &#8220;but they have to rob/steal/rape, because theyre oppressed and poor&#8221;</p>

<p>Good GOD!!! this sounds familiar. I always end up hearing the same thing, to which I say YES I CAN GENERALIZE&hellip;It is clear that people NOT raised or closely associated with numbers of blacks don&rsquo;t know them as some of us do, or they would GENERALIZE too.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The man-hating feminists are predominantly white women&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Although I agree with your premise about feminism-it is designed to denigrate and destroy Whites  &mdash;  if you look a little deeper into this issue, you will find it was neither started nor promoted by predominantly White women, although some did join and participate later.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;This was demonstrated in the O.J. trial. The prosecution naively thought having many females on the jury would be a good thing&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This was engineered by Marcia Clark.  She felt that black women would sympathize with a  women (of any color) who had been beaten up by &#8216;her man&rsquo; because of the high rates of domestic violence in the black community.  </p>
<p>She was profoundly wrong, of course, and was too stupid to realize that color trumps EVERYTHING else.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right that jury consultants told Clark repeatedly that black female focus groups, all of them, despised Marcia Clark AND Nicole Simpson, felt no sympathy for her whatsoever and stated that  &#8216;she got what she deserved.&rsquo;  Remember oj dumped a black wife for the beautiful young blonde  THAT&rsquo;s what the black females &#8216;focused&rsquo; on.  DNA meant nothing to them as the jurors reported later they could not understand it.</p>
<p>It seems for some posters on this thread and the first one, the oj trail was a turning point in their racial awareness. </p>
<p>I remember hearing an interview with black prosecutor Chris Darden<br>
right after the trial.  He said he took one look at the jury, at the black women especially,  and knew the prosecution could not possibly win the case.  Later, he was excoriated and vilified by the black community. </p>

<p>Yes, it is exactly how I feel.  I&rsquo;ve never had any trauma involved with them, and I&rsquo;m a successful person, doing quite well, so the radical leftists who like to think that people don&rsquo;t like blacks, because they&rsquo;re &#8220;losers,&#8221; are fools.  Most people I know who are REALLY anti-black are pretty successful. </p>
<p>Only in this day and age is it necessary to explain oneself for disliking a loud, unruly, violent, stupid, inconsiderate, arrogant, selfish, souless people.</p>
<p>They speak so much of having &#8220;soul,&#8221; but if there is a race on earth that lacks compassion and understanding it is these people with the &#8220;black&#8221; souls, if they are even assigned one.<br>

		<p>My dad never had much good to say about blacks, but growing up in the mid 60s I had absorbed the &#8220;peace and love&#8221; hippie ideal, and believed everyone was equal, or if they were not it was due to white discrimination.  I just knew the old man was wrong in his thinking.  </p>
<p><br>
I left home at 16 moving outside of Chicago into an apartment with some young GIs.  They occasionally gave the place over to some high school age blacks, who would bring their mostly white girlfriends over.  I&rsquo;d never witnessed anything like it.  The blacks had nick-names: Thunder, Grief, and Meat (can you guess about the latter&rsquo;s name?).  One day Meat and Thunder were over with two high school girls.  Meat told his girl to go upstairs with him, however she refused.  He swiftly took off his belt and began whipping her.  I never imagined such savage behavior was possible. I wondered where he learned this sort of savagery?</p>
<p><br>
Later, when I was in the Army in Germany, the extent of racial animosity was almost too much to bear.  Blacks were often heroin addicts, and our barracks were self-segregated.  No white ever went into the black section  &mdash;  it was understood that interaction between the races was verboten, and not in anyone&rsquo;s best interests.  As long as the heroin flowed, the blacks more or less were pacified.  </p>
<p><br>
It is difficult to describe what living with blacks was like.  I became convinced that there was something intrinsically different between the two races, and that little could be done to overcome the split.  Over the years I came to understand what my old man knew, so many years ago.</p>

		<p>To be truthful, it was Amren that lead me to see the true racial realities that exist, though for years I had suspected as much. Despite a steady indoctrination in high school of egalitarian views, I could not escape the observation that my own senses provided me - the races were different, especially Blacks. I noticed, even at a young age, the complete alien nature of Black people. Though I found myself as a child being able to feel comfortable around most other races, I always felt a huge sense of panic whenever I got around large groups of Blacks, especially adult Blacks. I remember going to a birthday party of a Black friend from elementary school and seeing for the first time the lewd and raucous behavior of Blacks. The thing that struck me the most was how the adult Blacks seemed less intelligent than me, and I was maybe 8 years old at the time. As I grew older, I became weary of Blacks as I faced more and more incidents of completely irrational Black behavior, some of them from my Black teachers. When I got into junior high, I saw many of my Black friends convert to the nature that I had witnessed in the adults. It did not surprise me, but at the time I attributed it to culture. </p>
<p>When I got to high school and started to seriously study genetics and heritability, I often wondered to myself the what&rsquo;s and why&rsquo;s of our racial differences. We didn&rsquo;t discuss this in school, but my biology teacher did once bring up racial differences as a valid biological concept and this sent my head spinning. I thought about the many environmental and selective factors that would&rsquo;ve given rise to variations in skin color, eye shape and face shape. I even thought deeply about intellectual differences and concluded on my own that the cold climate of the northern hemisphere likely had something to do with it. At the time, the internet was still in it&rsquo;s infancy and I had no way to explore my ideas further as the subject was taboo and there was no one for me to discuss them with. </p>
<p>For years I kept those ideas in my head and over a decade later came across an article on the internet discussing race and intelligence. The article dismissed the idea of race as a biological concept and claimed all differences were merely skin deep. I found this view to be deeply flawed and did a search for race and IQ. I discovered the writings of Arthur Jensen and I found Amren. From there my quest for knowledge about racial differences grew exponentially as one discovery opened up ten more. For the past ten years or so I&rsquo;ve spent a great deal of time exploring the politics of race in America and the rest of the world, as well as delving deeply into the field of genetics and anthropology. </p>
<p>I have to thank Amren and other like minded sites that have allowed me to find perspectives that I most likely would have never known had I lived in an earlier time. My hope today is that with the internet and the vast amount of information that is available, more and more young people will discover the evident truths about racial differences and take these discoveries with them into positions of leadership in the future and affect change in the policies our nation pursues. </p>

		<p>I was born in 1973 and I always took it for granted I&rsquo;d marry white  &mdash;  which I did.  To be completely honest, the thought of marrying a black man disgusted me.  The idea, to me, was like &#8220;let&rsquo;s not go there.&#8221;</p>
<p>I graduated from a Detroit-area high school in 1991.  In my graduating class were several pregnant girls  &mdash;  all black except for this white girl that was reportedly pregnant by a black football player  &mdash;  and that was talked about quite a lot!  There were very few mixed-race couples when I was in high school, I remember just that one.</p>
<p>Not too long ago I was flipping through my old yearbooks, and I noticed that the special-ed classes had plenty of blacks.  I was in the accelerated/gifted classes in school, and these had whites and Jews and a couple of Asians and one or two from the Middle East.  I remember this one Iraqi boy who was in my class, really smart young man, and really nice and polite, also in some accelerated classes.  I was in Honors Math, which means I was a year ahead of the &#8220;average&#8221; student in the school district (I had geometry in ninth grade instead of tenth, for example), and I don&rsquo;t remember any black students in those classes, maybe one if that.  They were mostly in Basic Math.</p>
<p>We had black security guards in my high school and they were typically shuckin&rsquo; and jivin&rsquo; with some of the black students who were skipping class.  Personally, I never thought my high school needed those security guards, not during my four years there.  </p>
<p>I was in the marching band and mostly the black boys (there were a few) were in the drumline  &mdash;  and having spent four years in the high school band, I&rsquo;ve found that drummers tend to act up a bit.  Guess where they sat on the bus to go to band camp?  In the back, and typically they had a boom box blaring their music.  I didn&rsquo;t mind, I just tuned out the noise and listened to my own tapes with my headphones.</p>
<p>I recall seeing a marching band at a competition, also from the Detroit area, mostly black.  It didn&rsquo;t surprise me that they didn&rsquo;t score very well, let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>So there were all these indicators over the years that blacks are not equal to whites (or any other race, for that matter) but it took a race realist friend of mine to point it out to me.  Then I look back over my 36 years and think, you know what, it was right there in front of me all this time.  You just need eyes to see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that whoever says that racism is ignorance probably lives pretty far away from &#8220;da hood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I understand where you are coming from but is it worth it for a child to come out of 12 years of public schooling not ready for the &#8220;real world&#8221; either? I agree with you that socialization is important and understanding of popular culture is essencial to being a well rounded person and I will say that Amish kids who do not have zippers of buttons on their clothing probably know who Michael Jackson or Madonna is. </p>
<p>Case in point about public schools: A few years ago my husband and I had the great misfortune to have to share a house with a 20 year of Hispanic girl and her on and off again White boyfriend. They had both graduated from public schools in California but if faced with any real knowledge they had no idea about American or World History, Geography, or writing a complete sentence without gramatical or spelling errors. However they knew (1) What their rights are and what to do and where to go when they are violated. (2) How awesome as persons they both were due to the constant self esteem education. I have never met people who had as little regard to anyone else&rsquo;s rights or feelings as these two. I could give examples but this is not the forum for it. </p>
<p>You say that private schools are just as likely to push the PC line on multiculturalism. While this can be true, if you research the school carefully and ask to examine the curriculum you will see just where the school stands on this sort of thing. Unless it is some sort of &#8220;touchy-feely&#8221; sort of Montissori or other non-secterian school then you will probably be right. If you choose a religious based school then they might be more likely to concentrate on educational basics rather than indoctrination. With most private schools, parental involvement is not only encouraged, in many schools it is required. I am not advocating raising kids in a bubble, but just being careful about what kids are exposed to. Not having or limiting television is another good idea. Even the commercials are indoctrinating kids or adults toward multiculturalism. Just honestly watch TV one evening and count how many commercials feature either a blonde attractive White woman and a black man, a stupid White person (or either sex) and a smart minority telling them how dumb they are. White men get it the worst but just honestly watch and tell yourself if this is not as much indoctrination as forcing someone to go to a class. </p>

		<p>All very interesting comments and anecdotes!  But while I see many references to blacks here (indeed, almost all are about blacks), I am a bit concerned about this over-emphasis on blacks because it overlooks  <i><b>the larger, more complex problem. </b></i> </p>
<p><br>
Blacks are undoubtedly America&rsquo;s most obvious, visible, vexatious racial problem   &mdash;    but by no means are they the only one.  In fact, without the constant aiding and abetting that they have received from certain other anti-white elements in our midst, elements which are less noticeable but invariably inimical to whites and friendly to blacks/non-whites, the blacks could never have become the problem that they presently are. This is not a simple subject!  And the problem does does not have a single answer.</p>
<p><br>
Even without the aid of government and the courts to promote their causes, blacks have enjoyed the continual mentoring of, for example, the many vastly wealthy extra-governmental foundations which have access to enormous resources. These, through the years, have been taken over by elements that are virtually ALL ultra-left-wing and anti-white in their ideology.   Add to these, the  identical situation with the churches and the schools and  the entertainment/information media establishment   &mdash;   all of which wield the power to shape people&rsquo;s minds.  And going beyond them, there are ethnic and religious groups which have their own very exclusive interests to serve, the majority  of the public be damned.  Indeed, many of these agree in seeing the hated majority as the enemy to be vanquished. Thus, they are fully in collusion with the blacks, and against the whites.<br>
 <br>
In the course of the past half century we have seen virtually all public policy and official &#8220;thinking&#8221; become pro-minority and anti-majority. The unquestioned  assumption behind this being that minority=good, and majority= bad.  The result is that the USA has become a pro-minority, anti-majority country!   Its own white majority has become The Enemy!   Its young people are taught in school (and its adults in the media)  that THEY are the problem.   Canada too, and by now most of the western, white countries have joined this anti-white program.  Thus, it is hardly surprising that we have seen such an astonishing spectacle as the President of the USA proclaiming the on-coming disestablishment of the American white majority as a wonderful thing, and this prospect being enthusiastically applauded by a hall of university students!</p>
<p><br>
It has only been with the sponsorship, protection, and mentoring which blacks have received   &mdash;   over the course of the entire  past century   &mdash;   that they have achieved so many victories at the expense of the beleaguered, reviled white majority &hellip; and almost all of those victories, when inspected closely, turn out to have been virtually GIVEN to them by these same powerful elements that exist, little noticed,  within the white camp. In other words  (and as is usual), our very worst enemies are among ourselves.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say I disagree with those policies.  But I should mention that Amrenners may want to try and get a well-rounded take on ethnic nationalism and not to get their news and views only from a single source.</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity (comment #28): I&rsquo;d estimate Mr. Jackson joined the USAF around 1968-70. I enlisted in 1979, and of the 48 men in my flight only four were black. Three were decent; the one creep also happened to be the dorm chief. Fortunately the rest of us had to put up with him for only six weeks.</p>
<p>Like JewAmongYou2 (comment #24), my military specialty required brain power, and the washout rate in training school was fairly high. Memories fade a bit after 30 years, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I had no black classmates (either AF or Navy) there, nor in the advanced school three years later. The only black officer I can recall in my career field was a female captain who taught at that advanced school. I admired her intelligence &amp; hard work so much that when it came time to re-up just before graduation, I asked to to swear me in.</p>
<p>One thing readers here must know about the 1980s military (at least the USAF) was the total lack of racial preferences <i>in any direction</i>. &#8220;Equal opportunity and treatment&#8221; meant just that. Blacks got no &#8220;brownie points&#8221; on classroom tests or promotion tests, nor were those tests &#8220;race-normed.&#8221; Blacks who failed to meet standards of competence or conduct were dealt with just as severely as whites. In fact, any mention of race on a person&rsquo;s job performance review was strictly forbidden. Not surprisingly, people got along and worked together quite nicely as a result. Conflicts occasionally arose, of course, but they were never race-related. Given what I&rsquo;ve read here and elsewhere about today&rsquo;s military, I&rsquo;m glad I left when I did.</p>

		<p>The personal stories posted here and on the first thread really affected this normally cold-hearted Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p>Several of the stories I have transferred onto my hard drive  &mdash;  Whitey Ford, Spartan 24, Anon #9, Lisa, Dumpty,  Frank, Conservative Lesbian, Jack, Grafted Devil, Thomas Jackson, Ellen, Georgia Mom, Jew2  &mdash;  all exceptional, valuable first person accounts of &#8216;seeing the light.&rsquo;  Many I read two and even three times.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;And as I write this I want to drop to my knees, round my shoulders, and sob like an abandoned child for all we have lost&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>How many of us here feel the same way about what has happened to our once peaceful, safe, beautiful communities?  This story comes out of Oakland, which was transformed a while ago, but this process is now happening quickly all over the country  &mdash;  non-Whites forced into White areas via &#8216;voluntary&rsquo; school busing, refugee dumping and Section 8 housing  &mdash;   bringing high crime rates, destruction of schools and attacks on Whites wherever they settle.  </p>
<p>My home, Southern California, has turned into a morass of babbling languages, spoken by competing groups of profoundly ethno-centric non-Whites. The pristine beaches where I spent time as a child now look like Tijuana  &mdash;  blaring mexican music, overcrowded, trash-strewn, dirty and they regularly receive grades of F or F- from the water quality district.</p>
<p>The typical California girl, which was once a beautiful blond in a bikini, has been replaced by a very young, pregnant latina pushing a baby stroller with three or four kids trailing behind.</p>
<p>I sat in the local mall tonight with my young son thinking about these powerful anecdotes, noting how few Whites I saw pass by and realizing that he will never experience California as I once knew it.  I am in my 50s and sure that I am a part of the final cohort of Whites that experienced the Golden Era of California before it became a banana republic.  I wanted to fall down and sob like that guy in the first story for such a profound loss.</p>
<p>And from M. Dumpty:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I arrived in Berkeley, Ca. about 35 years ago, where I still live&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>My father received a doctorate from Berkeley in the early 50s and spoke often of how beautiful it was there, of the views of SF bay, the city clean, safe, uncrowded, the food in SF incomparable. </p>
<p>I had a chance to visit Berkeley for the first time this past spring when I took my middle daughter and one of her friends there for a prospective students&rsquo; day.</p>
<p>I was shocked by the large number of loud, aggressive, dangerous &#8216;homeless&rsquo; people who roamed freely around the town and on the campus  &mdash;  I was told by a Cal employee that the worst ones had been cleared off the campus for the day so as not to scare parents. It was worse than anything I had ever seen in Santa Monica, which is noted for its large population of mentally ill and drug-addled homeless.</p>
<p>It seems this dangerous, wretched population has the right to do anything it pleases.  Is this true?  I am a wary Southern California, used to noting my surroundings, and this did not seem a safe environment for young White or Asian college students, especially females.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad my dad is no longer alive to see what has become of the state he loved so much.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was 75% white 25% black in 1960, but down to 10% white 90% black in 1970.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went into the Air Force in 1972. Looks like your demographics are correct.</p>
<p>BTW, an Air Force Training Flight in 72 was 60 men, 12 x 5. Of the 60 members in my flight, 58 were black with only two whites. Of the 58 blacks, 37 were from ESL and as you surmised, they were all sentenced to the Air Force by the same judge. In fact, the blacks liked to brag about this disgrace as if it were a badge of honor. </p>
<p>Here is another story thread from that same time. After about four weeks into basic, the DI gave us all permission to visit a nearby BX extension, kind of like an on-base 7-11. He gave explicit instructions that we were NOT to go the main base exchange and to be back in 20 minutes. The 58 blacks had appointed this one 24 year old ESL black as &#8220;dorm chief.&#8221; Evidently he had been a local thug leader back home. After the 20 minutes had expired, everyone had returned and was in formation except the Dorm Chief. The DI let loose with a spewage of expletives as he discovered this. Just then we saw the Dorm Chief strutting down the street towards the drill pad. He had on pair of reflective aviator sunglasses and seemed so proud of himself. Just then another DI was driving by in a convertible. We all saw the DI give the Dorm Chief the eye, then suddenly halt the car, jump out and grab him by the shirt. Our DI immediately screamed at us to sit down on the tarmack as he zoomed over there. Then both of the DIs were cussing and punching him in the gut. Turns out the &#8220;Dorm Chief&#8221; had disobeyed the order, went to the BX and purchased hisself some of those fancy &#8220;ribbons&#8221; to wear, including Viet Name era combat medals. The two DIs, both Vietnam Vets went berserk when they say this ultimate disrespect. Needless to say, we never saw the Dorm Chief again&hellip;probably got a bus ticket BACK to ESL.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Georgia Mom, <br>
I worked in Hong Kong for two years and I find your opinions off. I don&rsquo;t know what your experience was like but I didn&rsquo;t experience anything that made me angry in the same way. My conclusion is simply that it was a somewhat mundane place. But certainly first world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hong Kong?  Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been there.  If one wanted to be  charitable HK could  be classified as &ldquo;very low first world&rdquo; since it was governed and built by first world whites, but primarily peopled by orientals.  Not exactly the cultural Mecca that Paris or London was before the left began the massive re-settlement of third-worlders in Europe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amusing that you choose to cite a territory originally designed and run by the British as your example of Asian modernity.  Remember when the territory was to be ceded back to communist China in 1997? There was such an outcry among the Chinese living there that communist China agreed to keep the Western system in place for some years.  Those Asians preferred the system run by a white colonial government over a government of their own people.  So much so in fact that hordes of them wanted to rely on the &ldquo;citizen of the British Empire&rdquo; notion, believing that residing in Hong Kong made them automatically eligible for residence in Britain.  Millions of Chinese wanted to move there.   Britain, realizing it was facing a potential tsunami of incoming Chinese, vetoed these plans.  Funny how after whites vacate a former colony, instead of relishing their free space, the native third-worlders try to follow the whites home.   Swarms of Indians immigrating to Britain, millions of Chinese, Koreans  and Japanese trying to get to Australia, Canada and the States.  Groups of Chinese laden with backpacks hiding in shipping containers, trying to get smuggled in.  Coming in via snakeheads as indentured servants.  Setting up &ldquo;baby tours&rdquo; so that pregnant Korean and Chinese women can drop their babies in the US to steal citizenship just like Mexicans.  Very third-world behavior.  How many whites do you hear about desperate to get into Asia?</p>
<p>When the HK Chinese were not granted automatic residence in Britain they then borrowed a page from the black playbook and cried &ldquo;racism&rdquo;.  Just like when the Japanese in the US whined for apologies about internment camps. Notice they don&rsquo;t simply stay home in Asia or leave the West if they feel we are so racist.  They don&rsquo;t want to live in their lesser countries, they want to live in whitey&rsquo;s first class nation.  No different from other non-whites demanding access to whatever whites have created.  (As an aside, if whites have a second-rate intelligence compared to Asians why do huge numbers of Asians want to attend schools that we have founded?  When I was in Asia it seemed every Asian was hooked on the idea of getting into a school in the US, Canada, Europe or Australia.  Shouldn&rsquo;t these Asian Bell Curve geniuses have established the premier institutions of higher learning instead of whitey with the lesser-brain? Hmmm.)</p>
<p>Truly Asians are no different than other non-whites trying to extract good things from whitey.  And in this time when whites have been taught to hate self-hate the creepy obsession Asians have with miscegenation gives real meaning to the phrase &ldquo;yellow peril&rdquo;.  If whites still had a racially healthy psyche we would have no problem shutting down non-white immigration and would eschew race-mixing. But decades of guilt-tripping and programming for self-hatred have made our precious younger generation vulnerable.</p>
<p>I wish I had a dime for every time an Asian girl said to me &ldquo;You have bwu eye! You have bruva wikey Chinee girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend anyone sending their daughter to school at UC Berkeley  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s not a safe campus and not a safe town.</p>
<p>The main danger by far is from blacks&hellip;the white homeless are actually about the only class of people in this burg that have some sense about race, since they are preyed upon regularly by housed and unhoused blacks.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;d like to agree with Svigor that it&rsquo;s very useful to visit other white racial sites in addition to Amren&hellip;other sites have been a large part of my education also.</p>

<p>Thanks but&hellip;.</p>
<p>Too Late!  For what ever it&rsquo;s worth, UC Berkeley is still the Crown Jewel of the entire UC system.</p>
<p>My middle daughter just attended freshman orientation at Berkley  &mdash;  part of which was conducted by the police!  They told the students that there is 24-hour surveillance on the campus but to never walk anywhere alone, night or day.  The police also said a lot of laptop computers are stolen  &mdash;  I wonder if blacks hang out on the campus looking to prey on unsuspecting young students?</p>
<p>Seems my premise was correct about the &#8216;homeless&rsquo; having all the rights.</p>
<p>You also write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The main danger by far is from blacks&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>During parents&rsquo; weekend, I didn&rsquo;t see one black on the campus  &mdash;  security must have swept them completely away for the day.  In fact, I saw only a very small handful of blacks among the prospective students (which I took as a good sign).  </p>
<p>Later, as we were leaving town, I saw a number of very hard looking blacks (look, I used to work in Watts) hanging out on the street corners.  This I didn&rsquo;t like.  I am aware that wretched sections of Oakland are close by  &mdash;  I have warned my middle daughter and her Asian friends to STAY AWAY from Oakland and not to ride the Bart through there.</p>
<p>Pity that such beautiful parts of the bay area are dangerous and off-limits for Whites.</p>
<p>Wonder how Mario Savio feels about Berkeley now  &mdash;  oh that&rsquo;s right, he&rsquo;s dead.</p>

		<p>Bon, it&rsquo;s not just the campus that&rsquo;s dangerous&hellip;even more it&rsquo;s the neighborhoods that surround the campus&hellip;they are good neighborhoods as far as the people who live in them, but blacks drive in from Oakland, Richmond, and other parts of Berkeley, and either on foot or jumping out of cars prey on students and other persons who are on foot. The danger is mostly at night, but daytime is not completely safe by any means.</p>
<p>My personal impression is that riding BART through Oakland (without disembarking) is not especially dangerous&hellip;of course one should be in a car that has other passengers in it.</p>
<p>Mainly, she should be very careful anywhere on foot after dark, and vigilant during the day. Black criminals come to Berkeley for easy pickin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A lot of laptops are stolen from cafes, I think.</p>
<p>If she&rsquo;s careful, she&rsquo;ll be okay&hellip;.and of course the University has a lot to offer in spite of its liberal bent&hellip;undergraduates are sort of on their own there, it&rsquo;s not a school that holds your hand, that&rsquo;s for sure! (I tutored students there for many years).</p>
<p>Best wishes to her!! And to you!</p>
