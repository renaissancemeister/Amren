<h1>France Vigilant After Al-Qaida Burqa Warning</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>French officials were on guard Wednesday after an al-Qaida affiliate threatened vengeance for President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s criticism of the face-covering veils worn by some Muslim women.</p>
<p>France is maintaining &#8220;very great vigilance&#8221; toward actions and statements by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, or North Africa, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Eric Chevallier said in a briefing.</p>
<p>&#8220;French authorities reaffirm their determination to fight terrorism,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The Algeria-based group issued a statement on Islamic Web sites vowing to &#8220;seek vengeance against France&#8221; over Sarkozy&rsquo;s comments about face-covering Muslim veils such as the burqa and niqab. The declaration could not be independently verified.</p>
<p>Sarkozy said last week the burqa would not be &#8220;welcome&#8221; in France and would turn women into prisoners. France&rsquo;s parliament created a commission to study the issue, which could lead to banning the Muslim robes from being worn in public.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch said the move would be counterproductive, and a top British Muslim group said Sarkozy&rsquo;s comments were patronizing and offensive. Lebanon&rsquo;s most influential Shiite cleric called on the French leader to reconsider his statement.</p>
<p>The al-Qaida declaration called on followers to act &#8220;for the honor of our daughters and our sisters&#8221; and called on all Muslims &#8220;to respond to this hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard-line Algerian militants left over from a civil war between radical Islamists and government forces in the 1990s joined al-Qaida in 2006. They regularly target Algerian government forces and have tried to step up attacks against foreigners.</p>

		<p>What Al Qaeda does not realize, or is perhaps too fanatical to care, is that the same kind of French &#8220;liberte, egalite, fraternite&#8221; liberalism that let AQ into France to begin with also wants to de-burquaize Muslim women.  Racial equality, gender equality, samey same.</p>

<p>France is about to rue the day they ever allowed these people in, and it began with the creation of the &#8220;no go zones&#8221; in their cities filled with third world fanatics.</p>
<p>They only have themselves to blame.</p>

<p>The government is responsible for children. When girls are forced by their families and peers to where burqas then the government is responsible to provide freedom of choice. No future adult citizen of the republic should have been coerced as a child. That is anti-democratic and a violation of individual rights.</p>
<p>After the French Revolution, it could go even further than that as Question Diversity said above. The French government could go so far as to make teaching Islam, or any religion, illegal to children under eighteen years of age.   </p>

		<p>I agree voter. If Muslim women want to (or have to) wear whatever items of clothing, they can go right ahead. <br>
Sarkozy is an idiot, and besides, Muslims were allowed into France decades ago without the imposition of &#8216;French dress-standards &rsquo; from the government.</p>

		<p>The whole &#8216;burka issue&rsquo; is really a diversion from the real issue, and furthermore smacks of a sly, underhand attempt by Sarkozy to &#8216;punish&rsquo; muslims rather than to face up to reality.<br>
  The fact is that France&rsquo;s huge muslim population are definitely not &#8216;brown skinned Frenchmen&rsquo; as Sarkozy claims but a profoundly alien presence in that ancient nation, an alien presence that is firstly and foremostly muslim and seondly Arab or Berber by ethnicity, the &#8216;French&rsquo; identity doesn&rsquo;t register at all.<br>
  The real issue is why the alien presence was allowed into France in such massive numbers in the first place, and why once their presence was felt, was it allowed to grow so massively to the point where it is now projected to reach majority status by mid-century.</p>

<p>If it were just the Abayaa I wouldn&rsquo;t care either, but the Abayaa and it&rsquo;s attendant customs (male domination of females) and the agenda of the muslims to overthrow/destroy non-muslim cultures that is the problem. There is NO ROOM FOR NON MUSLIMS in a muslim world, EVERYONE needs to get that into and through their heads!</p>

Though it seems oddly contradictory, the presence of this &#8220;profoundly alien&#8221; (and even hostile) population is conforting to rootless cosmopolites of indefinite identity such as Sarkozy.  Hostile though they may be to him, nonetheless their presence makes Sarkozy and those like him feel much more &#8220;French&#8221; (by contrast),  and thus more secure.  If there were no extreme aliens to drawn attention away from Sarkozy, then HE would be the noticeable alien and subject to scrutiny/criticism.   And so, strangely enough, he <i> needs </i> them   &mdash;   whether or not he likes them, nor whether they like him.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what the fuzzy-headed socialists and liberals who are running  Europe do NOT get through their heads.  They are convinced, and completely believe it,  that once Moslems are exposed to the liberal culture of the West, they will loosen up and drop their rigid ways and stop being Moslems. Western leaders don&rsquo;t grasp that this culture is exactly what the Moslems detest and intend to destroy.  The everything-goes culture that the liberals find so attractive, is what religious Moslems find sinful and hateful.</p>
<p>Western leaders are staking everything on a gamble that the Moslem masses will be won over and somehow become good Europeans, given time.  This is nothing more than a blind assumption, based on trust and on hope and wishful thinking.  It&rsquo;s a lot to be gambling your country on!</p>

<p>Given free choice few Arab muslim women want to wear the abayaa and all that goes with it. Witness&hellip;take a flight to Saudia or Kuwait and as you approach you final destination watch the lovely muslim ladies take turns in the toilets to change into the abayaa, especially those from Saudia. Previous, they were in all liklihood dressed to the sexy 9s but could be beaten to death if they arrived home like that. If they chose NOT TO RETURN, it is likely they would have been kidnapped, of which I know several cases of just that from the U.of South Carolina</p>

		<p> The primary reason for the government being against the burqa is facial recognition. More and more places are under camera surveillance and if people are allowed to wear the burqa, it renders all of these cameras completely ineffective. There have been crimes committed by men wearing burqas that were identifiable only due to their capture either during or immediately after the crime took place.<br>
 If the west continues to tolerate the burqa, they will eventually   demand more concessions and then just start pulling religious demands out of thin air.This is an extremely intolerant religion. The west may have gone too far in being tolerant of these people. When civilizations begin to tolerate anything thrown at it, they will certainly fall. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Sarkozy is against ANYTHING muslim, see his previous speeches and comments about such. He is waffling because of the progress parties such as BNP and whatever the Francistan counterpart is. He wants to stay in power (as do all politicians to any end) and he doesn&rsquo;t care who he throws under the bus to do so. The muslim WILL kill him though, so expect to see some &#8220;accomodation&#8221; another of the French words for surrender.</p>

<p>And I  think you&rsquo;re right.  He is full of contradictions, trying to head off and co-opt the French right while forestalling and appeasing the French left.  But this issue goes beyond just Islam and Moslems.   They don&rsquo;t like him at all (and I am sure he must know that), but he is constantly trying to woo them.</p>
<p>The operative word here is not  really &#8220;Islam&#8221; but &#8220;Diversity&#8221;.  Globalists and miscegenationists such as Sarkozy are all for increasing the diversity, thus is he is for Islam&hellip;but only in that sense  (more Islam means more diversity).  The key thing is co cosmopolize and break down the host French population by weakening it and diluting it in any way possible.  It&rsquo;s just as we see happening in the US and in Canada.</p>
