<h1>Rights Museum Set to Pay Off Loan for King Papers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Errin Haines, AP, July 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Organizers of a civil and human rights museum planned for Atlanta said Wednesday they are poised to pay $11.5 million left on a loan so they can acquire the rights to 10,000 documents belonging to Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>In June 2006, Atlanta&rsquo;s mayor led an 11th-hour coup to buy the King Collection for $32 million only days before its planned public auction at Sotheby&rsquo;s in New York. Organizers had pledged to pay off the loan in two years but had struggled in the economic downturn to raise donations.</p>
<p>A four-member finance and executive committee of the Atlanta City Council on Wednesday unanimously recommended repaying the remaining debt with the help of city-issued bonds later this month. The plan requires the approval of the full council, which is expected to meet on the issue Monday.</p>
<p>Doug Shipman, executive director of the museum project, said paying off the loan will finalize acquiring the exhibition rights to the papers. The collection  &mdash;  which includes King&rsquo;s personal papers, sermons and books  &mdash;  is intended to be the cornerstone of The Center for Civil and Human Rights, which is planned to be built downtown and open in 2012.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The King collection includes items ranging from canceled checks, to a term paper King wrote as a student in college and a draft of his most famous speech, &#8220;I Have a Dream,&#8221; delivered at the 1963 March on Washington.</p>
<p>Atlanta  &mdash;  the birthplace of King and where he and his wife Coretta are buried  &mdash;  had been seen as the sentimental favorite in the planned bidding for the documents in 2006 despite speculation it could have faced stiff competition.</p>
<p>Morehouse College, where King earned a degree in sociology in 1929, is the steward of the papers and is responsible for archiving and preserving the collection for academic use.</p>
<p>Because the King Collection is considered a key economic development project for Atlanta, the city and Atlanta Development Authority agreed to issue $40 million in bonds to the center. The money was to be used for construction costs, but the center will use $11.5 million to secure the exhibition rights for the papers, said Cheryl Strickland, the authority&rsquo;s managing director for the tax allocation district.</p>
<p>The remainder is still set aside for construction costs and cannot be spent before the center raises the $85 million it needs to break ground. The center is required to reach certain milestones as a condition for spending its bond money  &mdash;  approved last year by the council.</p>
<p>The council administers the funds and also must approve the proposed amendment to the agreement. City Councilman Kwanza Hall, whose district includes the proposed museum, said securing the King Collection is an important step.</p>

		<p>&#8220;City of Atlanta paid $32 million for MLK&rsquo;s papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re going bankrupt.  I mean, they have plenty of money.</p>
<p>Oh, wait a minute, is this the same city that declared it wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to meet its budget this year?</p>

		<p>The is the same city (and black mayor) who furloughed hundreds of police, firefighters, paramedics, closed down fire stations and cut medical benefits paid to policemen and firefighters injured on the job, all due to a several million dollar budget shortage due to an &#8216;accounting error.&rsquo; Atlanta police and firefighters despise her, and they have a number of lawsuits against the city and Mayor Shirley Franklin.  Brilliant priorities.</p>

		<p>I live about 3 miles from the city limits of Atlanta.  I have lived in the Atlanta area for 29 years.  The city is a basket case. The infrastructure is in shambles.  The city government is an embarassment to the state. And the public education system is a double embarassment. I have driven by the MLK center many times and never see more than a handful of people there.  One might see school buses there on occasion meaning that school children are being sent there on field trips (compulsory). Otherwise not much is going on and the surrounding community is pretty rundown. Atlanta has no money to invest in MLK deification but don&rsquo;t think that will stop them from trying.  The city is broke. B R O K E </p>

		<p>The King family tried to sell this stuff to the Smithsonian some years ago, and were turned down because their asking price was absurd.  So they found a group of Blacks, the politicians of Atlanta, with the power to take the money from the public and pay far more than any private collector would.  I have only three questions: How long before King&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s children blow it all?  How much will his bastard&rsquo;s get?  And how long will it take the archivists to sort out all that really important stuff like high school report cards from the old cancelled checks and dry cleaning receipts that comprise the bulk of this man&rsquo;s &#8220;papers&#8221;?  </p>

Are there anywhere MLK shares to buy? I am hell sure the MLK business will be a fat one in the comming years..</p>

In the long term luther king could be set to be the prophet of a new religion. The religion of &#8220;Diversity is Unity&#8221; of course only under black rule&hellip; In forging a religion facts do not matter. Hey we already have at least one religion, where the &#8220;holy prophet&#8221; did not really surpass the level of MLK. (islam) </p>
<p>And hey, just think about it: we christians have a faultless Jesus which didnt cause any good to the western world, in fact I wold say christianity is one of the causes of the fading of western civilisation.</p>

		<p>So King &#8220;earned a degree&#8221; from Morehouse College in 1929?  I thought 1929 was the year he was born.  What kind of illiterates is the AP hiring these days?</p>

<p>I caught that error as well. King was born in 1929. Maybe he began his plagiarism, while still in diapers.</p>
<p>The newspaper must have laid off its proofreading staff.</p>

		<p>Will these papers include his plagiarisms? </p>
<p>It was proven that he pagiarized at least one college paper with others strongly suspicious.</p>
<p>Too, will they include anything regarding his infatuation with communism or socialism, since like most all blacks he liked any system where people are appointed rather than required to master any kind of subject matter.  </p>

<p>One need only reflect on the amount of money blacks will be willing to pay to see the papers&hellip;Atlanta will be RICH beyond a black big chief&rsquo;s dreams.<br>
