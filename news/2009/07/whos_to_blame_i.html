<h1>Who&rsquo;s to Blame in Sex Assault of Girl? Father Says Nobody</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corey Rangel, KNXV-TV (Phoenix), July 24, 2009 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s a story creating a huge stir across Arizona.</p>
<p>The parents of an 8-year-old girl sexually assaulted by four boys are blaming their daughter for the attack, according to police.</p>
<p>Those four boys are now under arrest, and the victim is in Child Protective Services, away from her mom and dad.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The father also said the family moved to the United States five years ago from West Africa and they don&rsquo;t understand the United States&rsquo; criminal system.</p>
<p>When ABC15 asked him what he wants to happen to the suspects involved in the assault against his daughter, he answered, &#8220;nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police are exploring what impact culture may have played in the incident and in the parent&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>The four sex assault suspects in the crime apparently lured the girl into a vacant shed near 43rd Avenue and Thomas Road last Thursday by offering her chewing gum, said Phoenix Police Sgt. Andy Hill.</p>
<p>They then restrained her, and sexually assaulted her for 10 to 15 minutes, according to Hill.</p>
<p>Officers were called to the scene after receiving phone calls about the young girl screaming, and running out of the shed partially clothed.</p>
<p>Arriving officers said they saw several boys running from the scene, and were able to detain one and later identify three more.</p>
<p>Hill said all the boys, ages 9, 10, 13 and 14, have been arrested and put in a juvenile corrections center. All four have apparently admitted to planning the assault and have been charged in the case.</p>
<p>One of the boys, identified as 14-year-old Steven Tuopeh, is being tried as an adult for the crimes, facing two counts of sexual assault and one count of kidnapping.</p>
<p>The 13-year-old suspect is accused of three counts of sexual assault, and one count of kidnapping. The 10-year-old is accused of two counts of sexual assault and one count of kidnapping. The 9-year-old suspect is accused of one count of sexual assault. All of the crimes listed are class 2 felonies.</p>
<p>According to authorities, the girl&rsquo;s parents said they blame their daughter for the assault and for bringing shame on her family.</p>
<p>A relative at the girl&rsquo;s home said the statement was untrue but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>According to the victim&rsquo;s family, the 8-year-old victim wanted to go to a party and left the home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looked around, I look around and she was not here,&#8221; said the 8-year-old&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Femi Babarinde, an African Studies professor from the Thunderbird School of Global Management, said it is normal to feel shame because of a rape in the family in the Liberian culture.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/2009/07/23/20090723abrk-phxsexassault23-ON.html">Oldest Boy in Assault of Girl to Be Tried As Adult</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Amanda Lee Myers, AP, Jul.y 24, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Authorities said Thursday that four boys ages 9 to 14 took turns raping an 8-year-old girl behind a shed for more than 10 minutes in what Phoenix police are calling one of the most horrific cases they&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>The outrage over the allegations intensified after police said the girl&rsquo;s parents criticized her after the attack and blamed her for bringing shame on the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;The father told the caseworker and an officer in her presence that he didn&rsquo;t want her back. He said, &#8216;Take her, I don&rsquo;t want her,&rsquo; &#8221; police Sgt. Andy Hill said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a deeply disturbing case that has gripped our community,&#8221; Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas said Thursday. &#8220;Our office will seek justice for the young victim in this heartrending situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hill cited the family&rsquo;s background as the reason the family shunned the girl. All five children are refugees from the West African nation of Liberia.</p>
<p>In some parts of Africa, women often are blamed for being raped for enticing men or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Girls who are raped are often shunned by their families.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a shame-based culture, so the crime is not as important as protecting the family name and the name of the community,&#8221; said Tony Weedor, a Liberian refugee in Littleton, Colo., and co-founder of the CenterPoint International Foundation, which helps Liberians resettle in the U.S. &#8220;I just feel so sorry for this little girl. Some of these people will not care about the trauma she&rsquo;s going through  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re more concerned about the shame she brought on the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ali Keita, a Liberian refugee and president of the Arizona Mandingo Association, works with refugees to ease their integration into U.S. society. Keita said that Liberian families may question why sexual-assault victims were in a situation that left them open for attack but that the initial response likely stems from disappointment and frustration with the family&rsquo;s circumstances.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s healing process will be particularly difficult, said Paul Penzone of Childhelp, which aids young victims of crime. Authorities said the victim was in the care of Child Protective Services.</p>
<p>&#8220;These four boys used what was a ploy to entice her to a place where they could take advantage of her almost like a pack of wolves,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what&rsquo;s so disturbing beyond the initial crime is the fact that a child needs to have somewhere to feel safe, and you would think that would be in a home with her own family,&#8221; not in state custody, Penzone said.<br>

		<p>I think that multicultarist haven&rsquo;t thought their program of attempting to blend all cultures together in one country through to the logical conclusion.Logic dictates that if the host country encourages all immigrants to retain their culture then said country is duty bound to respect all facets of that culture. You then have a situation where the people live in their own enclaves complete with their own laws, courts and punishment system. From that point forward; it&rsquo;s all demographics. The more people that arrive from that culture, the stronger they become. Then when they arrive at the tipping point, it&rsquo;s too late for the host country and the majority culture takes over with their laws, traditions and customs.<br>
 The more of these people we allow into our country, the more widespread these occurrences become.Since most of the &#8220;elites&#8221; in this country are multicultarist they will soon start to demand that their laws, traditions and culture supersede our own.</p>

I don&rsquo;t exactly consider myself a liberal feminist, but how can anyone who has any respect for women want to invite cultures like this to our country? </p>

		<p>I read this story on mainstream media yesterday.  My first thought was that this would likely have happened and is happening right now in Liberia, as well as many other locations in Africa.  The difference? - We brought them to Phoenix and now we are supposed to be shocked and horrified that it happened right here in the U.S.  </p>
<p>Our government is importing people who come from corrupt and brutal cultures and plant them in neighborhoods all over America.  We are supposed to integrate with them.  What happens first is that we are robbed, raped and otherwise made miserable prisoners of our own communities, unable to speak out for fear of accusations of racism and only slightly veiled threats to our jobs and basic security.  Next, we must move aside to give them a place ahead of us so that we can achieve an equal society.  On the way down to poverty, we cannot protect our children from their influence and assaults.  I can&rsquo;t imagine how our government can imagine a bright, shinny future through this sort of social management/manipulation.</p>

<p>This rape case is just another example of why third world values are incompatible with the ones we hold dear in the United States, and why they ought to keep those kinds of people out of the country. Maybe they should have gone to some Muslim country instead, seeing as to how they are more concerned with the shame of the family than the feelings of the victim, as well as blaming some poor 8 year old who was probably too young to know better. They would have fit right in.</p>

		<p>I wonder what feminists and women&rsquo;s rights organizations will have to say about this incident? Probably nothing. If the rapists and their rape victim had been white, they&rsquo;d be up in arms. But these supposed defenders of women&rsquo;s freedoms are too obsessed with multiculturalism to posit a response, let alone a critique and condemnation of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey ho, hey ho, western civ has got to go!&#8221; I&rsquo;ll bet these feminists were chanting something like that a few years back. Now they&rsquo;ve got their wish come true. I wonder how they like it?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a &#8216;shame based culture&rsquo;. They expect people to feel shame about world wide white supremacy when anything bad happens to anyone. Especially a person of color. Because a crime against a person, or nation of color, would be a real crime. They can&rsquo;t help it. It&rsquo;s in their genes.</p>

		<p>A middle-aged, lesbian classmate of mine posted this story on her Facebook page, and commented on how she couldn&rsquo;t understand the cruel response of the girl&rsquo;s family. I commented back (in full view of all) that in many African cultures, rape is considered a perfectly acceptable rite of passage for young boys (nullifying the potential for a &#8220;racism&#8221; charge, by playing up to lesbian man-hatred.) For this particular lesbian, I knew that arguing from a &#8220;womenist&#8221; perspective would allow my argument to be heard, even though I was subtly nudging her thoughts to the possibility that the African&rsquo;s culture was the problem.</p>
<p>I continued to play the &#8220;female card&#8221; by pointing out that this girl was lucky to be separated from her family, for if her rape brought shame to the family, it was very possible that another charming aspect of third-world culture would be felt: Honor Killing.</p>

		<p>I worked with a Liberian man several years ago. It was the most miserable time in my working career. </p>
<p>He would scream &#8220;Racism&#8221; at the drop of a hat, and bad mouth American Blacks, calling them &#8220;Lazy&#8221;, &#8220;Stupid&#8221;, &#8220;Ignorant&#8221;, etc., which they are, but I didn&rsquo;t need to be in the middle of it when the American Coloreds took extreme exception to Moron&rsquo;s words, and tried to punch his lights out. </p>

<p>One of the core tenants of the Church of Victimology is that whenever one designated victim group mistreats another designated victim group, it&rsquo;s always because of oppression by some non-victim group. For example, American Indians owned black slaves because their morals were corrupted by us evil white folks. Now, in this case, the reason that Liberian men mistreat their women is probably because they were enslaved. Since blacks in other African countries were never enslaved, the reason that they mistreat their women is colonialism or apartheid. I don&rsquo;t know how the multicultists rationalize mistreatment of women in Iran and Saudi Arabia, which were never colonized by the west, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve done it somehow.</p>
<p>Anyway, as you well know, all of this is complete bunkum. If all abled, white, heterosexual males disappeared tomorrow, white females would be enslaved into concubinage and treated even worse by non-white men than they treat their own women. Disabled and homosexual white men would simply be liquidated.</p>
<p>All I can say is that when non-whites become the majority in this country and gain real political power, these white feminist Laputans (double entendre intended) are in for the rudest awakening of their lives. </p>

<p>&#8220;Hill cited the family&rsquo;s background as the reason the family shunned the girl. All five children are refugees from the West African nation of Liberia.&#8221; (Um, and the parents aren&rsquo;t?)</p>
<p>Then why are we importing these people?  They have no place in our culture.  Oh, wait, I know why - to destroy the social cohesion of America - that&rsquo;s why!  How could I have forgot?</p>
<p>&#8220;On the hard left, race always trumps sex.&#8221; - No, on the hard Left (as in most places), MONEY, POWER and CONTROL always trumps everything else.</p>

While that would be well deserved, please remember that *all* women and girls would be in line for this sort of abuse - not just the insane feminists.</p>
<p>Also, as others and myself have posted: race *always* trumps gender in the PC world. When that is understood, many other things become clear.<br>

		<p>If you think that this infestation of lowlife immigrants hasn&rsquo;t already affected the basic foundation of this country, just sit in the entrance of a Wal-Mart and watch the people coming in and out. The entire American (and whatever else they are) public looks like they just climbed out of a dumpster, with trashy clothes, underwear showing from all directions, baggy, wrinkled, torn, faded, hanging off their backsides, tattoos everywhere. Even at work, people look like they&rsquo;re wearing what they slept in. America looks like the third world county it is becoming. </p>

&#8220;Mandingo&#8221; was made into a move,  released on DVD in 2008.<br>
It seems to have been a paean to miscegenation. And sensational racism!  Just check out the advertisement. Whites were never wickeder, nor more lustful!  And note the white man sitting with his feet planted on a black body!</p>

		<p>Gee, I&rsquo;m glad the people of the United States could provide an environment for backward Liberian culture to display itself. See, how nicely these specimens of human depravity dovetail with the non-profit-white-displacement-apparat and the state based safety/ welfare net.  Maybe after enough sexual crimes are committed in the name of &#8216;tradition&rsquo; we can send the US State Department out to find some African cannibals to come here and clean up after their own. Then the US President could have them in for a US Freedom Award while the remnant places the bicycle chains and padlocks on all the exits.</p>
<p>Sorry, disgusting reality leads to personal moments of exuberant imagination. Time to turn on the television and self re-program to brown. Besides, will be in mixed company this afternoon and  need to be passive, self loathing/ minority apologetic best.  </p>

		<p>This is just great. In addition to a traumatized girl, these African boys face prison time, in a true American hell, where they could be brutalized, and/or learn to brutalize, and come out ten times as worse. Wouldn&rsquo;t it just be easier (and cost effective) to deport them all and their entire family?</p>

		<p>Spend some time on the Arizona paper&rsquo;s web-site, azcentral.com.  I guarantee you&rsquo;ll be quickly disgusted by what and how the multi-culti immigration news is reported there.</p>

		<p>Nothing about his story surprises me; nothing.</p>
<p>Not the incident, nor the family reaction.</p>
<p>The only thing that sickens me is outrage of the idiots in America who are shocked, what did you people expect from people who do this as a way of life?  Open your simple eyes and see the world for what it is rather than what you hope or feel it is.</p>
<p>Africa and aids, Africa and sexual assaults, Africa and genocide, Africa and different value systems, please put your mind in focus and stop importing these people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Woul;dn&rsquo;t it be easier just to deport them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course it would!<br>
Ah, but then we would lose the benefit of their enriching diversity.<br>
And that seems to be the real reason behind having them here in the first place. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s really all about. It&rsquo;s not about THEM.  It&rsquo;s about getting US diversified.</p>

		<p>It is known that many church groups sponsor these animals and encourage their immigration along with their sub-culture.  It is time for all people that are concerned with this immigration fiasco to stop contributing to the churches that sponsor this human garbage.<br>
P. S.  The US government gives a &#8220;stipend&#8221; to these church-sponsored immigrants which is GREATER than the maximum &#8220;social security&#8221; payment that an American citizen can &#8220;earn&#8221;.<br>
It is a sad state of affairs when a sub-cultured &#8220;immigrant&#8221; can come here and be &#8220;rewarded&#8221; by our own government.  Let&rsquo;s not forget to mention that their (muslim) cult will be honored to a much greater degree than those of us who are Christians.  Americans are EXPECTED to defer to their &#8220;culture&#8221; by our own &#8220;government&#8221; (under penalty of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; legislation).<br>
Friends, the time for revolution draws near.<br>
Draw your own conclusions.</p>

		<p>  Under multiculturalism it is the dominant culture that adapts itself to the new immigrant&rsquo;s rather than the other way around. Wasn&rsquo;t Liberia partially settled by American blacks? Is this really part of their culture and should it be excused? If all cultures are &#8220;equal&#8221;, is the answer  &mdash;  yes?</p>
