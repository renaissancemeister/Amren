			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Yeagley, Bad Eagle: The Rantings of a Conservative Comanche, June 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Fifty years from now, there won&rsquo;t even be any white people!&#8221; said my pathological Middle Eastern neighbor. He knew I was an American Indian, and he expected me to dance in his vision.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t. I found his attitude, and that of his angry black wife, repulsive. I don&rsquo;t appreciate being presumed upon or being dictated to in any matter, especially in the matter of race. Nobody tells this Indian how to think. I&rsquo;m free to like and dislike whomever I please, for whatever reasons I choose.</p>
<p>My two neighbors were racists, obviously. And they were making me a victim of their racism. Because I was non-white, they presumed I was a natural partner in their resentment and animosity toward the white race. I was judged by the color of my skin, so to speak.</p>
<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">  <tr>    <td align="center"><img src="/news/2009/07/14/hated-white-race.jpg" alt="Yeagley" valign="bottom"></td>    <td rowspan="2"><img src="/illustrativeArticles/images/spacer.gif" width="15" height="270"></td></tr><tr><td align="center">&nbsp;<small><b>David Yeagley.</b></small>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>This all happened many years ago, but, I never forgot it. Today, I see truth in the words of my neighbor. White women are leaping in bed with black men, or other darkies of the world, and popping out strange-looking children. Generally speaking, the male in these incidents could not care less about the children. It&rsquo;s all about sexual aggression against the white race. They&rsquo;re happy to conquer for the moment, and to create ghastly, permanent consequences. Marriage and family have nothing to do with these misanthropes, nor the lusus naturae they create.</p>
<p>This denigration of race is a cruel mockery of manhood. It is a pathetic testimony of the personal irresponsibility and malignant selfishness of failed men. Indeed, a careless woman is generally such for the lack of a caring father.</p>
<p>Like the universal law of aesthetics. We want beauty. Superior beauty lies in the white race. It is the variety of color, the red hair, the blonde hair, the green eyes, the blue eyes. All the other races in the world have only one coloring, the same black hair, the dark brown eyes and skin. A bit drab in comparison, can&rsquo;t we say?</p>
<p>The darkies of the world are truly fascinated with the white race, and always have been. However, there is a certain envy that naturally, unavoidably develops. But the sexual encounter of the dark with the white makes the white dark. And what most people  &mdash;  especially white people  &mdash;  forget is the fact that the white race is the minority in the world. It is, and has always been, vastly out-numbered by the dark races. Moreover, the pigmentations of the white race are all genetically recessive. The whiteness is first to fade.</p>
<p>Therefore, integration tends to mean elimination for the white race. That&rsquo;s simply the way of the genetic world. That the white race became the most powerful, dominant, ruling race may be attributed to cultural values more than anything else. It was of course the white race that adopted the Judeo-Christian religion. The social constructs and psychological hierarchies in this tradition evolved a people more astute and agile in every way.</p>
<p>Whatever &#8216;mental&rsquo; problems the white race developed as a result of being more powerful are only fairly recent evolutions. In his day the white man has created a throne like no other in history. If it is criminal at the foundation, the challenge is chiefly from envy  &mdash;  always the weakest charge. Besides, what&rsquo;s the point of the dark man accusing the white man of not keeping his white morals, if the dark man himself does not believe in those morals? The charge of hypocrisy is moot, made in impotence. (The white man&rsquo;s self-flagellation is the only hope of the darkies.)</p>
<p>I would not look forward to a time when there is no white race. My neighbors were nothing I would want to see more of in this world  &mdash;  certainly not their attitude. But that there is a growing number of people in the world who think like them is a concern. The Muslim world tends to produce such a disposition.</p>
<p>Disguised though it may be in moral and religious terms, political terms, or even genetic terms, the case is fairly obvious: &#8220;the hated white race&#8221; is such for its beauty and power.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think the hate can be explained by anything but pure racial jealousy over prosperity.  Ignorant minds believe ignorant things.  Ignorant minds are going to believe that some evil doin&rsquo; must be going on in order to have the average person of one race to have more than another.</p>
<p>White liberals feed it when they religiously deny racial differences in IQ, intelligence and other matters.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken on the subject of race with one of my Hispanic friends. Not surprisingly, he revealed much envy. He talked about &#8220;how white people had all the money.&#8221; He also told me about the time when he saw, in his words, a &#8220;white b****&#8221; driving his dream car, and was angry and envious over it.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if these attitudes were held toward whites by the majority of the darker skinned people. Afterall, our race has invented virtually every technological advancement in this word and has created a civilization unmatched in beauty and progress by any other non-white civilization, so envy and resentment felt towards us by lesser people shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising.</p>

<p>Nonsense. The White Race became the most dominant race in the world due to genetics developed in a cold climate. Religion had nothing to do with it. White genes might have made them more accepting of Christianity, but that is not why they are dominant. In fact, one can argue that Christianity has made the White race weak.</p>

		<p>What a: beautiful, refreshing, honest, and well written article!</p>
<p>There are many truths to be found here; however, there is one that is so glaringly obvious, it is unfortunate that it even has to be mentioned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;White women are leaping in bed with black men, or other darkies of the world, and popping out strange-looking children. Generally speaking, the male in these incidents could not care less about the children. It&rsquo;s all about sexual aggression against the white race. They&rsquo;re happy to conquer for the moment, and to create ghastly, permanent consequences. Marriage and family have nothing to do with these misanthropes, nor the lusus naturae they create.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, white women are not the only ones guilty of this abdominal behavior these days. There are far too many &ldquo;white men,&rdquo; who refuse to accept that degrading their race (and in their own strange way admitting to a failed white masculinity,) is nothing to be proud of! There is only one way for the white race to reproduce and to flourish, and that is through unions between white men and white women; all other approaches, no matter how &ldquo;well intentioned,&rdquo; are acts of auto-genocide. </p>
<p>Or put another way, miscegenation and white nationalism/race realism are 100% incompatible. To believe, or worse to behave, otherwise, is to embrace and celebrate the very core of the abject evil that is multiculturalism.  </p>
<p>End of discussion and as always, God help us all!!!<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m in solid agreement, of course, with what this guy writes, and I&rsquo;m glad he wrote the article, but I have to say that if he thinks he can pass for an Indian then I can pass for an eskimo.</p>
<p>He reminds me EXACTLY of Ward Churchill.  He claims full Indian blood because of some kind of mental disorder, but he&rsquo;s obviously Caucasian, and in Churchill&rsquo;s case he was outed as a fraud.  Like Churchill this guy seems to think letting his hair grow long will convince people he IS an Indian.</p>
<p>I hate to have to write these things after so many compliments, but there&rsquo;s no way this guy is Indian.  He even expresses himself in writing like a white man. </p>
<p>NOTE:  I just made a quick &#8216;Google.&#8221;  It appears that this man&rsquo;s adopted mother was a Commanche, and he is a white man who has assumed an Indian persona, probably for the above reasons I cited.  Aparently he has had cosmetic surgery to make him appear a bit more &#8220;Indian,&#8221; it is claimed, but it didn&rsquo;t come out like he wanted, because he still looks like a white man to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;David A. Yeagley is a white supremacist who poses as a Comanche Indian. He was mistakenly enrolled in the Comanche Nation because the stepmother who adopted him is Comanche. He falsely claims descent from the Comanche leader, Bad Eagle (1839-1909). Comanche elders and members of the tribal government all deny he is actually Comanche.&#8221;</p>

Unfortunately, hatred for the white race includes a great number of whites.</p>
<p>As a race realist, I don&rsquo;t hate other races. Individually, I&rsquo;ve always gotten along well with diverse individuals.</p>
<p>However, I respect the true meaning of the word, diverstiy. Races are distinctly diverse and should remain so otherwise, you lose diversity. Races are not interchangable and we shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to pretend they are. It&rsquo;s unnatural and only creates increasing levels of anger, jealousy, and resentment.</p>
<p>While whites are more than happy to live with their own, other groups can&rsquo;t standing their own kind and are naturally drawn to whites for safety, security, and prosperity (all of which they can&rsquo;t seem to provide for themselves). Non-whites can&rsquo;t live without whites. They do everything they can to be around us. Yet, they hate us and want us to die off. That alone should tell you who&rsquo;s more intelligent.</p>
<p>I said I was a race realist but I got along with individuals. I used to work with an American Indian woman. On my birthday, she was the only one who gave me a present. It was a key chain made with bead work. She lived on a NY reservation and when she gave it to me, she proudly said, &#8216;it was made by a real Indian&rsquo;. I still have it and never used it. I keep it in pristine condition in the box she gave it to me in. While we were good friends at work, at the end of the day, we each went home to our own people. Some see that as hate. I see it as love. I want to see her culture survive intact as much as I want mine to as well.</p>

		<p>One thing I&rsquo;m sure most White people don&rsquo;t realize is the fact that members of other races - EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM - are jealous of Whites.  All you have to do is put yourself in their position.  There is no other emotion that one can feel, especially if you&rsquo;re Black.  There is no racism toward Blacks today or any other race by Whites, it&rsquo;s all by every one of these races AGAINST Whites.  The sad thing is that this media in this country has been conditioning Whites to back down, be subservient, and otherwise have a guilt complex the likes of which has never been fostered on any group of people in history.  whites are literally LETTING people of every other race, religion color etc. to take over not only here in the U.S. but in every majority White country in the worlds.</p>
<p>Wake up White people.  Please.</p>

		<p>Interesting commentary.  I don&rsquo;t know about the assertion that we&rsquo;re emulated for our &#8220;beauty,&#8221; but we&rsquo;re certainly emulated, envied, and often hated for our power.</p>
<p>The race, like it or not, has been responsible for virtually all human progress in practically all fields of endeavor.</p>
<p>To be sure, East Asians and Indians are capitalizing on and extending what whites originally introduced them to and in some ways are actually surpassing us, Japan being perhaps the foremost example of this.</p>
<p>But the white race has. for the past two millenia, been at the forefront of human progress in practically all fields of endeavor. </p>

		<p>&hellip;so I wish the author would clarify his boundaries for being &#8216;White&rsquo;-though there are many races that would OBVIOUSLY not be considered White by any reasonable person.  Similarly, it is a bit subjective, this article (though I agree with most of it).  Yes I agree that many non-White nationalities are jealously, and viciously anti-White: (particularly, and for the most part) Muslims (generally Black and Arab), Blacks, and Hispanics.  I think though that, to be fair, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I find that, on average, Kazakh, Japanese, and Korean women (on average) are far more attractive than the obese hordes we have in America (many of whom are, sadly, White).  Not just in relative terms, but Korean and Japanese women (in addition to the already mentioned nationalities) are attractive even in absolute terms. </p>

		<p>David Yeagley, Bad Eagle has it correct.  The white race possessing the most advanced genes as showed by their civilizations holds the key to the advancement of this planet.  Certainly, humanity will be in pure state of misery if the black  race were dominate.  But that will never happen for the yellow man will be the dominate race if the white man somehow disappears.  It is very unfortunate that the red man&rsquo;s voice is seriously missing on this planet for they also possess superior genes.  But in ages past, the red man fought each other so hard that a large amount of the superior genes were eliminated.  </p>

		<p>This guy has stated some truths that White people would not dare speak.  All Africans look the same, all Orientals look the same and even different nonwhite races look similar.  You could put a Filipino, a Mexican, a North African and a Saudi in a lineup and many people would not be able to guess which nationality is which.  </p>

		<p>I think I see a little bit of Native in him, looking at the eyes.</p>
<p>My mother is probably no more than 1/16 Cherokee but she does look Native and was told she looks at least half  &mdash;  and you could tell with my maternal grandmother.  I used to get made fun of in school for my &#8220;Japanese&#8221; looking eyes&hellip;but it&rsquo;s a throwback from my Native ancestry.  I&rsquo;m a brown-eyed brunette and I tan easily.  </p>
<p>At any rate, I do agree that a lot of the hate is due to jealousy.  I think blacks, being at the bottom of the totem pole, so to speak, are the most hateful.  I&rsquo;ve never heard too much about Native Americans going after whites in recent history, but there may be things I&rsquo;ve never heard about, granted.  I have a maternal uncle up in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan who&rsquo;s friends with just about everyone on the nearby Chippewa reservation.</p>
<p>Whether this guy is Native, Caucasian, or whatever, I still agree with what he says, regardless.</p>

<p>Having met other Native Americans, I learned that many of them are surprisingly more supportive of whites, than other non-white races. And he was not saying that white brunette women can&rsquo;t be beautiful, he is simply saying that the variety found mostly in the white race is beautiful, and I firmly agree even if it isn&rsquo;t modest or humble of me to feel this way. Those other groups aren&rsquo;t even comparable. Aboriginal people only have blonde hair, while they are very young, and it hardly flatters their skin tones, sorry but that&rsquo;s a fact. The rest of those people are rarities, in their native countries, where with white people, it isn&rsquo;t even rare for members of the same family to have different hair colors naturally.</p>

		<p>By the way, do the people at AmRen think only blondes and redheads are &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;, or have they forgotten the fact most Whites are brunettes?</p>

<p>Only white usually are described as brunettes, since it is whites who have so much variety. And Jaclyn Smith is indeed beautiful, you will rarely find a non-white woman with her delicate features, and porcelain complexion. <br>

		<p>While whites are more than happy to live with their own, other groups can&rsquo;t standing their own kind and are naturally drawn to whites for safety, security, and prosperity (all of which they can&rsquo;t seem to provide for themselves). Non-whites can&rsquo;t live without whites. They do everything they can to be around us. Yet, they hate us and want us to die off. That alone should tell you who&rsquo;s more intelligent. </p>
<p>Further proof of the pathological jealousy he speaks of. A lot of it goes to the point of insanity. A world without whites would be, less progressive, less prosperous, more violent, more dreary, and definitely less beautiful.</p>

		<p>     It is our duty to mate with White Women, but we need pretend<br>
that they are the most beautiful or even that they are our friends. Generally, they have been completely ruined by the ma-<br>
terialistic upbringing. Add to that the feminism and political<br>
correctness, and you a race of harpies and harridians. So I guess<br>
the answer is find one who isn&rsquo;t as bad as most and then just<br>
grin and bear it. For Enland as they used to say. To expect White<br>
Women to be racially conscious and sympathetic to the plight<br>
of persecuted White Men, is expecting far too much. White Women<br>
will remain Enemies until we begin to regain power. Then they&rsquo;ll<br>
come in out of the cold like nothing was ever differnt. It&rsquo;s not<br>
very admirable, but that&rsquo;s the way of women. Pragmatic to a de-<br>
gee almost impossible for men to imagine. Study the rape of the<br>
Sabine Women in Roman History for a good example.</p>

		<p>This is 100% accurate. I sometimes feel like a broken record on my posts here, but I routinely cite the overriding theme of intense racial resentment and envy on the part of non-Whites and their never-ending program of grievances and gripes against Whites. Indeed, the whole great egalitarian fraud of liberal western democracy is undergirded by a superstructure of naked hatred for Whites - and tragically many, many Whites have risen to the bait and accepted this monstrous lie as legitimate. Our doom is written in the language of this very phenomenon.</p>

The &#8216;blonde&rsquo; black in the first photo looks outrageously fake. Getting a little desperate to ward off the reality aren&rsquo;t we? whites have a much more &#8216;diverse&rsquo; variety of hair color/texture and eye hue than do many other races. The fact redheaded/Blonde is associated naturally with whites further proves this. Im sure you being most likely liberal would like to tout &#8220;Whites are only making it seem that way!&#8221; But reality betrays you, as if you look around, you&rsquo;ll be hard pressed to find anything to the contrary.

		<p>Non-whites have always been jealous of white women. Sadly a lot of the white women who are dating black men are obese with short bleached blond hair.</p>
<p>One of the posters above mentioned a lot of the white women here in America are obese. I concur. However you see a ton of Mexican women here in California who are obese and so are their children. </p>
<p>If the white race were not a sign of beauty then why do Asian women have their eyes fixed to look like Caucasian women? I see Mexican women here in California highlight their hair and even bleach it blond (eek) to look more like the white woman. </p>
<p>That is why Black women straighten their hair and sometimes even bleach it as well. In Hollywood, the lighter skin blacks are the ones who get the leading roles. Very rarely do you see a really dark black person who is a tier 1 actor or actress. Men maybe, but not women.</p>

Truer words have never been spoken.</p>
<p>Though I don&rsquo;t understand why everyone thinks that miscegenation is happening on a massive scale.  Percentage wise(at least in the US) whites marry non-whites least than any other group.  But since there are more of us it tends to look larger in terms of absolute inter-ethnic marriages.  And this I got from a previous amren article.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m too worried - while I have seen a few white woman/black male couples, the woman is usually either immensely unattractive(usually obese as well) or so stupid that it hurts just to hear her speak.</p>

		<p>As an Indian from India, I completely agree with this Indian man (Yes I know he is a different kind of Indian). <br>
Whites (both men and women) are on average not only better looking than other races but are the most creative, dominant race that has invented the modern world, gone to the moon and charted the depths of the oceans.  White people do not realise how jealous other people are of them. And jealousy leads to a desire to kill and harm those who posses the qualities, the jealous party wishes to have but cannot have. This attitude is even stronger among blacks. If they cannot have what the Whites have then according to them, nobody should have that. Ofcourse blacks are the exact opposite of Whites, they are the most ugliest and have the least achievements among the races of humans.<br>
  This attitude is strongest among blacks and weakest among North East Asians with others (South Asians, Hispanics, Arabs etc&hellip;) in between. The best course of action Whites must take and should have taken till now as nations and communities is to not have any contact with the non-White world than actually needed. Keep a distance. Whites do not need them.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the other white female readers of this site are very aware that black females are very jealous of our hair. Jealous to the point of pathological venom.<br>
This article made me think of something that happened to me this very morning.<br>
I was on the bus today and there was a black female sitting directly behind me yakking into a cell phone. It said to whomever it was talking to, &#8220;girl, this white (expletive) be sittin in front of me, I want to cut that (expletive)&rsquo;s hair off and use it for my weave.&#8221;<br>
I was the only person sitting in front so I know the comment was about me. <br>
My hair isn&rsquo;t anything special. Another white lady wouldn&rsquo;t even notice it as anything to comment on. It&rsquo;s very average. It&rsquo;s just &#8220;white girl hair&#8221;, pretty fair and straight.<br>

<p>Those examples are mostly from the Middle East and Central Asia -where whites have mixed with darker-skinned people- due, historically, to slavery and warfare - the same kinds of threats that white people are facing now.</p>

<p>There are far too many overweight Americans today, that goes without saying. But while there are too many overweight white Americans, there are even more overweight Black and Hispanic Americans. There is data to back this one up. So to suggest that obesity is a white issue is ridiculous. In fact, decades back obesity wasn&rsquo;t an issue in America, and in those days the country at least 90% white. Americas eating habits have changed considerably over the years, along with the level of activity, this is also true of school age kids. But again, obesity is hardly white trait.</p>

		<p>That non-Whites are insanely jealous of Whites is a given. Mexicans are &#8220;eaten up&#8221; with envy of us. I see those Mexicans living on our street&hellip; furtively watching the Whites trying to see what they have&hellip; what they bring home from the store. If one has a new car, they can&rsquo;t stop jabbering about it.</p>
<p>With Hindus, Asiatics, even with African Blacks in general, I firmly feel it&rsquo;s insane envy of White accomplishments. After all, those races have virtually nothing to point to as to monumental accomplishments. Granted Asians had civilizations but virtually are able to boast of relatively few technologocal inventions or accomplishments. Africans, zilch! Which explains the massiveinferiority complex Africans can&rsquo;t admit but have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the old, old story. The Industrial Revolution that really got things moving&hellip; started in England, Europe and North America. The steam engine was invented/developed in England; NOT, emphatically not in an obscure Asian village. Emphatically not in an African collection of huts. Just as the early intellects who gave us such a great start were those magnificent Greeks. Leading us into mathematics, philosophy, and so on and on.</p>
<p>Given the dark races   &mdash;   Africans, Asians, modern Hispanics owe everything they know and have to White accomplishments&hellip; their massive hatred, envy, and of course their built-in inferiority complex becomes quite understandable.</p>
<p>For example, why would we have to undergo the hype and nonsense of Black History month&hellip; if Blacks actually HAD any real history to boast of.</p>

		<p>In virtually all the countries and cultures of the dark-skinned peoples those with the lightest colored skin are the most idolized and those with the darkest colored skin are considered to be inferior.<br>
 <br>
The reason some white women debase themselves with dark-skinned minorities is because women in general are creatures of the heart and as such they think emotionally rather than logically.  People who let their hearts rule their heads are people who can easily be manipulated through their emotions by the guilt trips, lies and half-truths of the unscrupulous.  This is why the Founding Fathers forbid females from voting.  This is also one of the many reasons we had racial segregation in America&hellip;<br>

But like the writer above, I would not want to live in a world where white women were replaced by minorities, not just in the literal sense of word, but as objects of beauty. Beauty might well be in the eye of the beholder, but few of the models I observed, could adorn as many walls or male fantasies as this late great beauty did in the 70&rsquo;s <br>

		<p>Hey Stuck in No Man&rsquo;s Land:</p>
<p>Those pictures that Anon posted are real. The first pic is not of Black children, but of Aborigine children. Aborigines sometimes will have blonde hair when they are young, but lose the color as they get older. And the others are of Central Asians, except the Mongolian girl. Light eyes and hair are not unknown in Central Asians, because Central Asia is a buffer zone between Europe and Asia and there is a long history of gene flow between the regions. I think Anon was just pointing out the falsehood that light hair and eyes is exclusive to Whites. There&rsquo;s no need to get defensive; it only makes you look ignorant.</p>

<p>The poster Mike is wrong. These White women that are with black men are not just the unattractive ones. Many are beautiful. Look at Tiger Woods wife. How about Heidi Klum with Seal? How about Nicole Simpson? The list goes on. I have seen the very unattractive obese White women with blacks also. But more and more are very pretty dumbed-down blondes. And yes, Mike there are thousands of Whites who are with blacks and it is growing daily. I see them everywhere. In Europe also. </p>
<p>In all fairness, I think it should be pointed out, that all of these black men are wealthy and famous. (Or now, infamous and incarcerated in OJ case). And while not all of them are always blond, many are, because I believe these black men are truly attracted to their polar opposites, in their quest to obtain the ultimate trophy wife. However, lower income black men, rarely attract super-model types from what I have observed.</p>

		<p>This thread is as good a place as any at AR to tell a true story that happened to me in 1989. <br>
I was going out after work for a few beers with my buddy George (moved to the US from Ecuador at the age of 12 and was 24 at the time of this story), George&rsquo;s brother Michael, and our friend Santana (who was Puerto Rican).</p>
<p>Santana and I were in the back seat of the car and we pulled up to a Korean Deli and Santana jumped out to get us some beers.  While waiting for him George turned to me and said, &#8220;Why do White people think they are so superior to everyone.&#8221;<br>
I sighed loudly and said, &#8220;Ah, come on George! We&rsquo;re out for some beers and you&rsquo;re going to start with that?&#8221;<br>
He and his brother practically in unison, told me I was backing away (presumbably not obeying their corny macho, code of the street, whatever).<br>
They insisted, so out it came.  I even surprised myself, and was even more pleasantly surprised at the reaction.<br>
I said, matter of factly, neither angry or friendly, &#8220;How many White people do you know are moving to Ecuador to live a better life?&#8221;<br>
Their reaction? <br>
The two of them burst out laughing. Michael said, &#8220;My man!&#8221; and George said, &#8220;Finally, an honest White man.&#8221;<br>
Of course, that was twenty years ago, and people like us have long since been out-numbered by Whites like the dope who wrote this article. <br>
But until there is NO hope, I refuse to despair.</p>

I am a Native Californian, who was educated in the public school system, between the late 1960&rsquo;s and the early 1980&rsquo;s. Now believe it or not, in those days, the whopping majority of students were white. In elementary school, I would say that in each given classroom, around  2 students were overweight, with the rest being well within the normal healthy range. Today, when I drive by my old schools, almost none of the children are white anymore, and I can&rsquo;t help but notice that the vast majority of these kids are noticeably overweight, and even obese. Now as a white woman, in I will admit that I have gained an extra 10 pounds over the last decade, which I am not too happy about, but I am in my late 40&rsquo;s now, and my BMI is 20.1. The normal range being(18.5 to 24.9) So I try not to beat myself up about it too much. While it might be true, that East Asians tend to be the most trim ethnic group, I don&rsquo;t know where you get the idea, that whites somehow lead the way in obesity?</p>

		<p>Integration withother races is suicide. the author is correct. but whites must remember, and teach their kids, that even if we are a minority, we can rule the world and control culture and our environment, because physical strength is important, but mental power and the capacity to put thought into action is all important. Strong bodies, strong minds, strong imagination. That must be our slogan. And one more: No Fear.</p>

<p>&hellip;so I wish the author would clarify his boundaries for being &lsquo;White&rsquo;-though there are many races that would OBVIOUSLY not be considered White by any reasonable person. Similarly, it is a bit subjective, this article (though I agree with most of it). Yes I agree that many non-White nationalities are jealously, and viciously anti-White: (particularly, and for the most part) Muslims (generally Black and Arab), Blacks, and Hispanics. I think though that, to be fair, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I find that, on average, Kazakh, Japanese, and Korean women (on average) are far more attractive than the obese hordes we have in America (many of whom are, sadly, White). Not just in relative terms, but Korean and Japanese women (in addition to the already mentioned nationalities) are attractive even in absolute terms.  </p>
<p>Okay, here are pictures of your average Kazakh women</p>

		<p>Although too gushingly pro-White, the author has a point. Generally, unattractive and economically-challenged people will always resent and envy those who don&rsquo;t suffer those. Any person of European descent living in areas that are majority non-European will immediately notice and feel this pathological hostility directed at them.</p>

		<p>Like the universal law of aesthetics. We want beauty.  It is the variety of color, the red hair, the blonde hair, the green eyes, the blue eyes. All the other races in the world have only one coloring, the same black hair, the dark brown eyes and skin. A bit drab in comparison, can&rsquo;t we say? </p>
<p>Not long ago, while on another website, I clicked a link with heading &#8220;Only mixed whites are attractive&#8221;, which sent me to the African American forum. On it, some rather catty black women were saying that only Southern European women were beautiful, because in their words, &#8220;they had color&#8221;, and they got their dark beauty from their black roots, and really weren&rsquo;t white. They went onto add, that real whites were those pasty faced people to the North. For them, fair skinned, fair haired, light eyed Europeans were something to disparage, because they are not a group they can so easily lay claim on. Although, it is just as preposterous, that they would try and claim Southern European women, are part black, just because they mostly have dark hair and olive skin. Because whites were blessed with diversity in hair and eye color, it seems the goal among some non-whites is to attempt to divide them. Light eyed, light haired, Europeans are white, dark haired, dark eyed Europeans are not. I think truly irks them, that one race could have so much variety, that they refuse to accept it.</p>

		<p>Geronimo&hellip;A very intense man and though vicious was widely respected for his intelligence and audacity. At the world fair he is reported to have commented how kind and peaceful the white populace was and he was sure had he been around Mexicans he would have had to defend his life. In a book written by a Colonel Dodge back in the eighteen hundreds (our wild Indians)(not subjegated) he comments how one of his Indian friends willingly came over the to the white way of life due to the perpetual vindictiveness of his own. Basically what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that a great deal if hogwash has passed for legitimate perception in the past 40 or so yrs of hate the white man syndrom. This author though to me appearing largely caucasion is telling a VERY obvious truth that has been covered up with very flawed romantacism, like the kunta kinte garbage so many half witt whites used as fuel to masochistically canabalize themselves about. When white people were in their struggle for a piece of the pie they never would have fallen so deeply for this horse hocky&hellip; but given a little suburban comfort that came after their accomplishments their minds often turned to mush, believing the refuse that entertained them on the apptly named Boob Tube. With their heads filled with this refuse and false self rightious indignation they went out to debase their ancestors in alleged compensation,..when in reality their real Hidden indignation was likely their self disgust (Unbeknownst to them) of their own lethargy and self betrayal in not maintaining the momentum of their ancestors. This Mr. Yeagley spelled it out as succinctly as could be hoped, not pulling any punches,,,I admire his courage to say the obvious which has become such a liability in this age of Genetic Marxism!!! </p>

<p>WR: &#8220;My understanding is that Yeagley himself claims to be of mixed white and Comanche ancestry. Whom should I believe  &mdash;  Yeagley or the usual leftist rabble determined to smear him?&#8221;</p>
<p>ranger:  First of all, let me reiterate that I don&rsquo;t really like having to criticize the man, and I&rsquo;m certainly the last one on here who would take the word of any left wing radical, but so far as I&rsquo;ve been able to determine Yeagley claims he&rsquo;s Commanche, not just half.  I&rsquo;ve never seen anything where he claims to be of mixed heritage.  And if he is of mixed heritage, why doesn&rsquo;t he say so instead of identifying himself as a Commanche?  Half white/half Commanche doesn&rsquo;t translate to &#8220;Commanche.&#8221;  </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s quite an accomplished man, and, without doubt, he looks white in the above photo, so it would seem to me that, as a white, he would want to identify with whites, since it is they who have excelled in the same areas he has.</p>
<p>I &#8220;googled&#8221; &#8220;david Yeagley, photos,&#8221; to get a better idea of how he looks, besides the above photo and came up with the following.  In two of the photos he looks white, but in one of them he does appear to be half Indian, so I&rsquo;m not sure now what to make of it all.  Allegedly his hair was light brown, but he dyed it black.  I suppose I could search until I find earlier photos of him, but quite frankly I&rsquo;m not interested enough to spend the time.</p>
<p>I DO know that if he&rsquo;s another one of these romaticists who find some kind of misguided desire to appear Indian and he&rsquo;s really white, then I think he clearly undermines everything he has to say.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m willing to give him a pass, since he&rsquo;s on my side, but I can&rsquo;t help but resent him since there IS a very real possibility he&rsquo;s white, but doesn&rsquo;t want to say so.  His many accomplishments are indicative of whites, not Indians.<br>

		<p>I think you&rsquo;re missing the point of the article that only European/white descended people can produce the blonds and red-heads &mdash;  like the two photos at the end of the article. Hair color is only one factor in determining race. In addition, our United States Government classifies Middle Eastern People (Arabs, Palestinians as in your pictures) as white. </p>
<p>Yes, technically the government classifies the above groups as white. Although, white is really synonyms with European. Racially however, they are Caucasians. All whites are Caucasians, while not all Caucasians are white.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the old, old story. The Industrial Revolution that really got things moving&hellip; started in England, Europe and North America. The steam engine was invented/developed in England; NOT, emphatically not in an obscure Asian village. Emphatically not in an African collection of huts. Just as the early intellects who gave us such a great start were those magnificent Greeks. Leading us into mathematics, philosophy, and so on and on.&#8221;</p>
<p>But surely, the Greeks learned everything they knew from Africans, you know, the ones that built the Pyramids?  THen we, as a race of people, covered up and destroyed all the evidence of Black acheivement in ancient times,like how they circumnavigated the world (but didnt colonise Madagascar, 300 miles from the African coast), and built vast empires, while Europeans were hunting Mammoths.  Oh, and the Vikings were Black as well.  Cant you tell, just look at the population of Iceland, mostly descended from Vikings. Black as your hat, every last one of &#8216;em. </p>

_________________________________</p>
<p>Have you ever been to Europe? The only predominantly brunette part of Europe is the SE/SW. Northern and a very large section of Central/Eastern Europe is blond-light haired. </p>
<p>Here from Bertil Lundman:<br>
https://carnby.altervista.org/lundraces/lundman-races1.htm</p>
<p>As you can see, the most depigmented people are found in the dampest parts of Europe. The warmer and/or oceanic climate, the more darker people (very visible in the British isles)</p>
<p>The map circulating on web (on Wikipedia too) from amateur anthropologist Peter Frost and his funny &#8220;Sexual Selection&#8221; thesis are utterly wrong.</p>
<p>Light hair isn&rsquo;t restricted to Caucasoids (there are even SE Asians with light hair and eyes and yes, they don&rsquo;t have white admixture both anthropologically and genetically). </p>
<p>In my opinion, these are very old traits and can occur among all races, in Europe more, in other continents rarer, most probably something to do with to the climate.</p>
<p>Light hair may have been an advantage in snowy terrains of Central/Northern Europe while hunting (a better camouflage unlike dark hair?) like polar/grizzly bear difference.</p>
<p>According to another study, men tend to be more light eyed than the women which may also be related to hunting.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care for the author&rsquo;s style.  Writes like a savage civilized, probably to sound Apache Indian, though I expect he<br>
doesn&rsquo;t live in a teepee, ride a horse to work, or shun the supermarkets so he can kill his own dinner.  Nice act but hard to take seriously.  Nonetheless I think his opinion here typifies what all American Indians I have ever heard really think about the demographic changes occurring due to illegal immigration.  They greatly disdain it.</p>
<p>And the attitude among the newcomers, I have been learning, is exactly as author presented in the example of his neighbors.  They actually view whitey&rsquo;s demise with satisfaction and they know they all feel the same way.  This attitude is not how Americans have viewed minorities, nor do I believe it is the attitude most American minorities have had towards white people, who, like the author here, probably said nothing and walked away when the newcomers would gloat over bad things happening to white people.  </p>
<p>Minorities, American minorities, resent the invaders as much as American white people do, and that is as it should be.  </p>
<p>An aside here, I find the author&rsquo;s giving the impression that there are not white people with black hair and/or brown eyes, rather peculiar.      </p>

		<p>It is unfortunate that this American Indian wants to trivialize the problems between the races as being stemmed from jealousy about something as petty as looks. Now to me he appears to be Caucasian, but he could be of mixed ancestry and he has the right to identify as he wishes. As a very light-skinned Black woman who has hair texture different from many Blacks, I do not like it when people mistake me for another race. But I feel there are enough issues in the Native American community and he can write something more constructive.</p>
<p> There have been many successful people (of all races)who probably would not win a beauty contest by any means. American sitcoms and reality shows are full of homely people. And the big screen has its share of homely stars as well. </p>
<p>Now I know studies have been claimed to show that how attractive you are CAN be linked to how successful you will be, and we all know that beautiful people enjoy many perks that not-so -pretty folks do not. But looks fade so make sure you have something else with it.</p>
<p>What worries me is some idiot claiming people want to attack Whites only because they are &#8220;beautiful and powerful&#8221;. There have been many homely white victims and perpetrators of crime, and let&rsquo;s face it, many people of color feel Whites are weak. (I personally do not think that way) In most places in the U.S. Whites are the majority so they can make up a larger pool of victims and/or potential victims. I have heard some Blacks say that Whites are easy to rip off because they are so gullible (which is a stereotype in itself). But most people choose to commit crimes based on flaws within themselves. They could be just evil, psychologically unstable, or just lazy choosing to take from others instead of working for a living.</p>
<p>One thing I also find strange is how &#8220;the whitest of whiteness&#8221; is overrated. A White person of any ethnic background can be beautiful, but they would be beautiful because of symmetrical facial features not JUST because of eye color or hair color.  I have seen a pretty brunette passed over for a homely blond many times(As was the experience of both of my college roommates who were White brunettes) It was too weird but I think the guys were probably lame anyway.</p>

One would think that sexual selection by now would have created a preponderance of blondes. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel AmRen does any such thing. Yes, among whites, blondes are less common than brunettes, and redheads, even less common that blondes. But among my own white relatives, there are natural blondes, brunettes, and redheads. So it&rsquo;s not THAT rare. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if someone has an attraction for one hair color over another, that is all a matter of personal taste. But what&rsquo;s great about it, is there is all this natural variety to choose from. Yes, some non-whites don&rsquo;t just have dark hair, dark brown eyes, and brownish skin. But their variety is nothing like that of the white race, with hair that can commonly range from dark to light, and can be combined with brown eyes, hazel eyes, green eyes, gray eyes, and blue eyes. I think it is interesting how these liberal social engineers, try and program whites into believing they need diversity, in their boring cookie cutter lives, by bringing more non-whites to Europe, when these non-white immigrants often blend in with one another. It is whites have the most natural diversity, and I feel a lot of non-white resent it. It is usually not whites who promote a Nordic ideal, but interestingly, many non-whites, resent Nordic looking people, because it is look they can never achieve. A brown haired white woman, can lighten her hair to blonde, and look totally natural. A blonde white woman can dye her hair red, and look ravishing. But when non white women attempt it, they,  usually look ridiculous, and unnatural. Quite frequently, it usually non-whites who promote darker hair and darker eyes as superior, even on whites. But that is because they yearn to be the standard of beauty.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;And Jaclyn Smith is indeed beautiful, you will rarely find a non-white woman with her delicate features, and porcelain complexion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agreed. That is why I posted a picture of her to illustrate my point about the beauty of brunettes. I actually met her a number of years ago in Manhattan when she was at her prime. No picture could ever do that woman justice.<br>

Quite honestly, with that beautiful face of hers, she could have hair of any color, and still be breathtaking. Lately, she is wearing somewhat lighter, in more of an auburn shade, though it hardly detracts from her beauty. Even more amazing, she is in her 60&rsquo;s now, and still looks incredible. Her bone structure is so exquisite, you could shave her bald, and she would still be gorgeous. </p>

		<p>One quick thought&hellip; other than a few psychological cripples, how many White males would want to marry either an Afro-American of Hindu female? Next question: Why would they even consider it? Beauty is subjective. Most people would find it only among their own kind.</p>

		<p>Re:Howard at 6:27 PM on July 14 - &#8220;In fact, one can argue that Christianity has made the White race weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, Judeo-Christianity has DEFINITELY made the White race much weaker than it once was.  Judeo-Christianity, with its hideous &#8220;One World/One People/One Love&#8221; doctrine has been pushing multiculturalism down White throats for almost 2,000 years.</p>
<p>Judeo-Christianity has also been very dysgenic for the White gene pool, with many of the smartest White males not breeding in Europe for about 1,000 years because they were so often forced in to the celibate priesthood.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Pleasant enough looking, I guess? But, I don&rsquo;t care how politically incorrect this sounds to you, I still believe that average white women, are generally better looking.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think the average white woman looks better than the average asian women too.  But whites are not reproducing in any great numbers.  Also American whites are so mixed anymore that there has been a real downgrade in terms of their beauty.  I see photos of people from the 50s and 60s when there was a high white birth rate and can see whites had high rates of very attractive people compared to now.</p>

<p> let&rsquo;s face it, many people of color feel Whites are weak. (I personally do not think that way) In most places in the U.S. Whites are the majority so they can make up a larger pool of victims and/or potential victims. I have heard some Blacks say that Whites are easy to rip off because they are so gullible (which is a stereotype in itself). </p>
<p> <br>
It might surprise some of those non-whites to learn that many whites aren&rsquo;t half as gullible as they like to believe. We know how they like to talk about us. The internet alone, can provide valuable insight. What&rsquo;s interesting though, is how often they contradict themselves. On one hand, they insist whites are weak, then often turn around, and talk about whites and their brutal barbaric history of colonization, war and slavery. Which is it? Are they weak, or are they cruel barbarians? At any rate, when they bring up the white mans evil history, it is usually intended to inflict shame, and guilt upon whites. The brainwashed lemmings who fall for it, can justifiably be described as weak. However, when the writer speaks of power, he isn&rsquo;t so much talking about street toughness, or immunity to crime. More likely, he is referring to the mans history of achievement. All the things some non-whites choose to downplay, or even take false credit for in the form of Afrocentrism. He is just cutting through the bull, and giving his own honest take on racial relations today. Even though he is bound to be resented for it by other non-whites.</p>

		<p>  Howard at 6:27 pm, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I believe in God, however I do believe that whites have taken the christianity thing way too far when they will give their last dollar to some television preacher whom will blow it on some other race, or hookers for himself. The huge fancy churches and all the wrappings that go with it will NOT bring you any closer to God. Too many churches fund missionaries to other countries, and waste precious funds on people whom could care less. Too many churches use funds to supplement illegals in our own country. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the churches that raised the white race to dominance. It was the white race itself, belief in one&rsquo;s own race and peoples.</p>

<p> As a very light-skinned Black woman who has hair texture different from many Blacks, I do not like it when people mistake me for another race. <br>
One thing I also find strange is how &ldquo;the whitest of whiteness&rdquo; is overrated. A White person of any ethnic background can be beautiful, but they would be beautiful because of symmetrical facial features not JUST because of eye color or hair color. I have seen a pretty brunette passed over for a homely blond many times(As was the experience of both of my college roommates who were White brunettes) </p>
<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t quite understand why you judge whiteness according to how light someone hair color is?  Maybe, this is how some non-whites perceive our level of whiteness, but very few whites feel this way. To me, any Caucasian of European ancestry is white, no matter what hair or eye color they have. My sister has two 13 year old fraternal twin girls, one has blonde hair, and the other brown. Do you think we view one as more white than the other, when they share the same biological parents? Hardly! Both girls are cute, and popular with the boys, although they haven&rsquo;t begun dating yet. And honestly, most of us do judge physical beauty according to more than hair color. I am sure even for most white men who prefer a certain hair color, they still prefer the hair, frame a pretty face. I honestly don&rsquo;t believe we as whites are nearly as caught up in hair color, as many blacks are with skin tone with the light skin vs dark skin issue. So, I don&rsquo;t see why some of you are so fixated on the blonde vs brunette thing? Either way, this man did not say anything, about blond or red haired white women being superior to dark haired white women. He was just saying that most non-whites do not have blonde hair, red hair, blue eyes or green eyes. And he wouldn&rsquo;t like it if such types vanished from this earth. There is nothing wrong with finding this child beautiful<br>

		<p>Mr. Yeagley is correct in so many of the things he says, especially that many &#8220;minorities&#8221;, hate and are extremely jealous of whites. I have experienced this on a personal level, over and over. Jealousy by fellow minority workers who wondered what kind of house I have, how big it is, etc. What my car cost me. How much money do I actually have, etc. The funny thing is, they simply assume that I have all of these things, in abundance, and leave it at that. It&rsquo;s kind of an axiom for them to consider whites as being, rich, priviledged, powerfull in some way,etc. There really IS, a seething enviousness, or hatred, that many minorities have towards whites, and I say it not because of having read articles like the one above, but because of having direct experiences long ago, that proved it to me. In some cases, I have even been told that this is the case, by people who are minorities that I have been friends with. I really am losing respect for many whites, for as obviously smart as many are in so many ways, when it comes to the things that are RIGHT NOW, occuring in this nation of theirs, and that are DIRECTLY AGAINST THEIR OWN BEST INTERESTS, THEY ARE JUST PLAIN DUMB. SORRY, BUT IT&rsquo;S TRUE. How can a people who did so many great things, fall so low?</p>

		<p>Bobby:</p>
<p>You just made me think of something.  In the last decade or so, there have been more and more companies, particularly large corporations, that have implemented the workplace policy of prohibiting their employees from discussing their salaries and wages that they make from the company with each other.</p>
<p>I think race plays into it somehow.  I have two theories on how it plays in:</p>
<p>(1) Blacks making the same as whites on the same rung of the corporate ladder get mad when the whites have a better standard of living with the same income, and get ignorantly jealous.  They don&rsquo;t stop to consider that personal behavior and vices factor into it.</p>
<p>(2) Affirmative action means blacks are promoted into positions up the rung of the ladder that they are wholly unqualified to fulfill, but the work needs to be done anyway.  So the company has some passed-over white do the work, and quietly gives him more money.  They don&rsquo;t want people talking about their salaries because the blacks on the same level of the white person in question would get mad and jealous, (not realizing that there was a very good reason why the white was getting more), and whine and scream civil rights lawsuits and NAACP.</p>
<p>A non race theory:</p>
<p>(3) Lilly Ledbetter.  The company where she worked had this kind of policy, and as it turned out, it was all to conceal gender discrimination.</p>
