			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Egelko, San Francisco Chronicle, July 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California is entitled to administer school achievement tests and high school exit exams in English to all students, including the nearly 1.6 million who speak limited English, a state appeals court ruled Thursday.</p>
<p>The First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco rejected arguments by bilingual-education groups and nine school districts that English-only exams violate a federal law&rsquo;s requirement that limited-English-speaking students &#8220;shall be assessed in a valid and reliable manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>The federal law, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, neither requires nor forbids testing in a student&rsquo;s native language and leaves such decisions largely up to the states, the court said in a 3-0 ruling. It noted that the U.S. Department of Education has approved the state Board of Education&rsquo;s testing plans since 2002, though department auditors recently suggested more accommodations for limited-English-speakers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Justice Timothy Reardon] also said developing native-language tests would be difficult, because students in California speak at least 40 languages. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For students who speak limited English, the law requires &#8220;reasonable accommodations,&#8221; which can include extra time, use of dictionaries, and giving instructions in a student&rsquo;s native language. States can exempt students from the test during their first year in a U.S. school.</p>
<p>The law penalizes any school if any identified group of students falls short of state academic standards or fails to meet certain benchmarks for progress in any year. The penalty for several years of noncompliance can include changes in a school&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>The nine districts in Thursday&rsquo;s case all have schools that have been penalized under the law, including one school that has been placed in trusteeship, Coleman said.</p>

		<p>So what good is a high school diploma if you go to get a job and can&rsquo;t speak anything resembling fluent English? Can&rsquo;t communicate effectively with customers, co-workers etc. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably twice that many. Many Mexicans speak something other than Spanish, many Philippines something other than Tagalog, and so on.</p>
<p>The Justice has a point that should be hammered home.  You can&rsquo;t argue that some Mexicans have a <i>right</i> to take tests in Spanish without implying that other Mexicans have the same right to take them in Mixtec.   (Yes, it will break the system  &mdash;   but that&rsquo;s what we want!)</p>
<p>The ticket machines for the rapid transit in Minneapolis will sell you a fare in Spanish and (I kid you not) Somali and Hmong. But not in Ethiopian, Eritrean, Russian, Ukrainian, Korean, Tibetan, Cambodian or Lao, despite the presence of those communities. I suspect that&rsquo;s because Somali and Hmong use our alphabet while the others&rsquo; scripts are alien.  But that&rsquo;s hardly fair  &mdash;   all foreign languages are equal! </p>
<p>By the way, I have never seen anyone use these other languages to buy a ticket.  The Somalis, to their credit, learned English before arrivingl; the Hmong don&rsquo;t ride the train; and it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me at all if the Mexicans were riding without a ticket.</p>

		<p>Testing kids in English is fine, except that TEACHERS are held accountable for their students&rsquo; scores - and if they have a room full of kids fresh out of the river from Mexico, and you can bet they don&rsquo;t speak or read English, well, such an unlucky teacher is penalized because of her kids&rsquo; low scores on the state tests.  That&rsquo;s why teachers just about fight over who gets the Asian kids - they know that Asian children will be speaking and reading English just fine by the end of the school year.  They also know the Mexican kids won&rsquo;t, and the punishment for that will fall on the teachers, not on the kids.  The problem with No Child Left Behind (NCLB)is that they don&rsquo;t consider the material the teachers have to work with - i.e., the ethnicity of the kids.  Believe me, I have 10 years&rsquo; experience - in primarily Mexican barrio schools in SoCA - and it makes a HUGE difference where the kids come from (ethnicity).  It&rsquo;s even worse if you&rsquo;re in a black low-class area - they have no excuse as far as language goes, but the language they use is dirt-poor in terms of decent vocabulary, and the kids for the most part aren&rsquo;t really interested in doing any work to learn.  So unless you&rsquo;re prepared to put on a major &#8220;dog and pony&#8221; show every day, such kids will score just as badly as the Mexican immigrant kids on the state tests at the end of the school year.  The scores reflect this, but the authorities persist in refusing to acknowledge the ethnicity differences and in punishing teachers for the lack of accomplishment in the groups that always score lowest.  I would advise any young person to stay out of education today - it&rsquo;s thankless, draining work with few positive results.</p>

		<p>If this law is reviewed by the federal US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Sanfrancisco, this state court decision could be tossed.  The Ninth Circuit often ignores the Constitution and Congress and goes its merry way. Think of 12 Nancy Pelosis sitting in black robes. I don&rsquo;t doubt political connections between Pelosi, Boxer and Feinstein and the judges of the Ninth Circuit. Politics don&rsquo;t stop at the high federal appellate level, as demonstrated recently by Judge Sonia of the federal Second Circuit(NY and Connecticut).</p>
<p>George Bush&rsquo;s Big Fat Federal Interference with Local Schools&rsquo; No Child Left Behind Law is a disaster. Thanks W. You were not a conservative, you moron.</p>
