<h1>Sotomayor Failed to Disclose to Senate Memo in Which She Argued Death Penalty Is &#8216;Racist&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pete Winn, Cybercast News Service, June 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Judicial Confirmation Network (JCN) says Judge Sonia Sotomayor failed to disclose to the Senate Judiciary Committee a controversial document arguing that the death penalty is &#8220;racist&#8221; and a violation of the present &#8220;humanist&#8221; thinking of society.</p>
<p>The 1981 memo, they say, should have been disclosed as required under Question 12 (b) of the questionnaire that the Supreme Court nominee turned in Thursday.</p>
<p>Question 12(b) requires a nominee to &#8220;(s)upply four (4) copies of any reports, memoranda, or policy statements you prepared or contributed to the preparation of on behalf of any bar association, committee, conference, or organization of which you were or are a member or in which you have participated.&#8221;</p>
<p>JCN Counsel Wendy Long sent a letter Friday to Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and members of the committee arguing that Sotomayor had not properly complied with this requirement because she had not submitted the 1981 memo on capital punishment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Long told CNSNews.com that her group had obtained a copy of the memorandum from an undisclosed source  &mdash;  and was convinced of its authenticity. The copy of the memorandum attached to JCN&rsquo;s letter to the Judiciary Committee is signed by a three-person task force of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund (PRLDEF) that included Sotomayor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She also truthfully listed on the questionnaire an April 10, 1981 letter from PRLDEF to then-New York Gov. Hugh Carey, opposing reinstatement of the death penalty.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what she omitted, and what is far more substantive and revealing,&#8221; Long told CNSNews.com, &#8220;is the underlying policy memorandum that she and two other task force members sent to the board of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund with all their reasons for opposing the death penalty, and arguing for the organization itself to take the stand that it ultimately did take in its letter to Gov. Carey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The memo that Sotomayor signed makes a number of &#8220;controversial, unsupported, and badly reasoned assertions&#8221; about the death penalty, Long added.</p>
<p>The memo, titled &#8220;Task Force on the Bill to Restore the Death Penalty in New York State,&#8221; and dated March 24, 1981, states:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>  &mdash;  &#8220;Capital punishment is associated with evident racism in our society. The number of minorities and the poor executed or awaiting execution is out of proportion to their numbers in the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The document was signed by Sotomayor and the other two members of the task force  &mdash;  Joseph P. Fitzpatrick, S.J., and Jorge Batista.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, a Washington Post.com story cited Fitpatrick as the &#8220;driving force behind the document,&#8221; but failed to report that Sotomayor was required to disclose the document to Congress  &mdash;  but didn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, what she&rsquo;s saying in this memo is that everybody agrees with this: that the death penalty is racist, that there&rsquo;s no other view, that it completely violates the Judeo-Christian position  &mdash;  all of these are highly controversial positions that are certainly contradicted by other evidence,&#8221; Long told CNSNews.com.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Then they need to NOT kill people, and, thus, they won&rsquo;t be executed.  Problem solved.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s because minorities (mainly blacks, Chicano Hispanics and Afro-Caribbean Hispanics) commit murder disproportionate to their numbers.  The hard truth of the matter is that whites convicted of first degree murder in states where there is capital punishment are more likely to be executed than blacks (ibid.)</p>

		<p>Sotomayor should have looked at the stats involved!  If they had really looked for &lsquo;racial disparities&rsquo; and racism they might looked into the fact that a black person is 108 times more likely to rob a white person, 34 times more likely to assault a white person, 15 times more likely to murder a white person than the reverse, and that black men are around 600 times more likely to rape a white woman; and yet blacks are only 2 1/2 times more likely to be charged with an officially designated hate crime.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that Sotomayor is working with an agenda and that&rsquo;s the way she will rule as a justice of the Supreme Court. <br>
She is a proven quota queen and has a strong bias against white people.  She has a good chance of being one of the worst appointments in the history of the court. </p>

		<p>Judge Sonia is not honest. That bothers me far more than her position on the death penalty. Many Catholics oppose the death penalty. Many don&rsquo;t. Be honest as to where you are coming from. </p>
<p>Frankly the issue is, will Judge Sonia support the precedent of the Court to uphold the death penalty in some cases and not in others. There is no room for an absolutist on this issue on the Court. </p>
<p>It was a disgrace a few years ago when Justice Brennan voted for the criminal in every case where the death penalty was an issue. Can this woman think; can she fashion opinions on matters where she may personally disagree with the outcome of the Court but must follow the Law. Can she walk and chew gum at the same time?</p>
