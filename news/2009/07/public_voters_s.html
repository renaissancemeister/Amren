			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beth Hale, Daily Mail (London), July 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Her ambition is to follow in her uncle&rsquo;s speedy footsteps and win Olympic gold.</p>
<p>For Rachel Christie, that dream is still at least three years away. In the meantime, however, the 20- year-old niece of Linford Christie has just won another title  &mdash;  becoming the first ever black Miss England.</p>
<p>The professional track and field athlete swapped her running gear for high heels and a glamorous dress to win the contest on Monday night.</p>
<p>It means 5ft 10in Miss Christie will have to juggle her training schedule again as she prepares to face another hurdle  &mdash;  a bid for the Miss World crown in South Africa later this year.</p>
<p>But her win was under something of a cloud after the contest&rsquo;s website showed that she had gained only nine votes in the public voting part of the competition, compared with fellow finalist Zoiey Smale, who got 2,013.</p>
<p>Although 20-year-old Miss Smale won the public vote, that was only enough to secure her a place in the last 15 of the final. In the event, she did not finish in the top three.</p>
<p>Part-time model Miss Christie had been one of the favourites to win Miss England, after being crowned Miss London City in May.</p>
<p>But she nearly did not make the contest after a car crash on Friday left her with whiplash and bruised legs. More used to being put through her paces on the running track  &mdash;  by her uncle or his former coach, Ron Roddan  &mdash;  Miss Christie was yesterday getting used to a whirl of beauty pageant publicity.</p>
<p>Speaking of her win, which she greeted with tears, she said: &#8216;It means the world; it really does mean so much to me.</p>
<p>&#8216;One of my reasons for doing Miss England in the first place was because I wanted to show people, the younger generation especially, that you can do something positive with your life.</p>
<p>&#8216;Whoever you are, you can be who you want and whatever you want to be if you just put your mind to it and have ambition and determination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Christie trains six days a week at the stadium named after her uncle in Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, West London, and is already highly ranked at the 400 metres and the heptathlon. Her brother James, 22, also trains at the stadium.</p>
<p>Their father Russell had been a promising athlete but unlike his brother Linford, who won Olympic gold in the 200 metres in Barcelona in 1992, fell into crime.</p>
<p>On the night of Linford&rsquo;s Olympic glory, a warrant was issued for Russell&rsquo;s arrest for allegedly stealing clothes and handling stolen credit cards.</p>
<p>In 1994 came a three-year sentence for theft and beating up a lover. He was stabbed to death in 1996 after becoming involved in a drugs war.</p>
<p>Miss Christie, who lives with her mother Diana Kiss, two brothers and a sister, says it was her father&rsquo;s death that made her think about &#8216;what&rsquo;s important&rsquo; in life.</p>
<p>While her ambition and focus is fired by memories of her father, her inspiration is her uncle. Growing up in West London, the whole family used to gather round the television to watch him compete.</p>
<p>She began athletics training aged 11, but fell in with &#8216;the wrong people&rsquo; and lost focus until she realised that she did not want a future &#8216;on benefits&rsquo;. After an 18-month injury break she is now fighting back, and aims to shave seconds off her personal bests to join the British Olympic team.</p>
<p>Her venture into the world of beauty pageants was partly driven by a need for more money to fund her training.</p>
<p>&#8216;I applied to Miss England because I thought it might give me an entry into legitimate modelling and that would help me fund my training,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>She added: &#8216;We struggled for years, we had no holidays, no car  &mdash;  the day we children got something we wanted was a rare one. So I know I have to work hard.</p>
<p>&#8216;When you begin with very little, maybe you have to aim high.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last night rumours continued to fly about whether her family name had helped her win a place in the final.</p>
<p>Miss Smale, who competed as Miss Oxfordshire, said: &#8216;I felt quite let down as did all the girls that I spoke to because the ranking three didn&rsquo;t win any of the awards that were available for our hard work in the run-up to the finals.</p>
<p>&#8216;There were so many things we had to do. Yet none of it mattered at the end of the day.</p>
<p>The public vote was supposed to be acting as one of the judges&rsquo; decisions. It was a big deal to me, but on the night it felt like it meant nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Calls to register a public vote cost more than 60p each  &mdash;  and only small print on the official website indicates that a &#8216;vote does not mean a contestant will win the competition&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Organiser Angie Beasley said all the girls knew success in the public vote would only secure a &#8216;fast-track&rsquo; place in the last 15 and counted as one-seventh of the final judging decision.</p>
<p>She said Miss Christie also had a fast-track place because she was representing a cosmetics company. Half the finalists were fast-track contestants.</p>
<p>Soldier Kat Hodge is glowing with the thrill of taking second place in the Miss England contest  &mdash;  and nursing a pair of very tender feet.</p>
<p>In her day job, the Lance Corporal is used to wearing sturdy boots, but for the beauty pageant these were replaced by a pair of heels. The 22-year-old clerk with the Adjutant General&rsquo;s Corps is probably the only entrant to Miss England who has a commendation for bravery.</p>
<p>Miss Hodge, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was only 18 and was serving in Iraq with the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment when she leapt into action after the vehicle she was travelling in overturned.</p>
<p>It gave an Iraqi insurgent time to grab two rifles and threaten the soldiers. Miss Hodge punched him and retrieved the guns.</p>
<p>She said she entered the competition because she wanted to do something different and promote the Forces. &#8216;I&rsquo;m really proud to be in the Forces. The Army made me who I am. It&rsquo;s taught me so much and given me so many skills, so I want to be able to give something back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She has been doing some modelling work, but added: &#8216;My ambition is still with the Army. I&rsquo;m not kidding myself I&rsquo;m going to be the next Kate Moss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As for the men she works with, she said: &#8216;They are more interested in the other girls in their bikinis. I&rsquo;m just another lad.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Uncle Linford was eventually exposed as a drug cheat, so he&rsquo;s not exactly one to look up to. However, the drug use did explain him running his best and fastest races at age 37. As for young Ms. Christie, track fans know she was never considered any type of prospect on the world stage of track and field. More hype as the PC train rolls on.  Enoch Powell will definitely have the last laugh. </p>

		<p>Reading this story is a posters dream come true. There is so much insanely stupid about this article that I hardly know where to start. While I think that military service is honorable I found this line to be particularly ridiculous:</p>
<p>(FROM ARTICLE ABOVE)<br>
Miss Hodge, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was only 18 and was serving in Iraq with the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment when she leapt into action after the vehicle she was travelling in overturned.</p>
<p>It gave an Iraqi insurgent time to grab two rifles and threaten the soldiers. Miss Hodge punched him and retrieved the guns.<br>

		<p>Why are they letting non-ethnic english become Miss England?  It defeats the entire purpose of these contests.  That, and the blonde on the left is far more attractive in my opinion, though granted the gal in the middle has very attractive (indeed, quite caucasian looking if you ask me) facial features.</p>

		<p>None of the three look like beauty queens to me. It appears that they picked average whites as second and third place. I wonder if this was done because beautiful whites would have made the black winner look even worse by comparison?</p>

<p>Any black judges?</p>
<p>Actually I have lost interest in beauty pagents many years ago when they started making the talent and oratory skills a big part of the contest.</p>
<p>It should be based on purely physical attributes.</p>
<p>Black girls generally don&rsquo;t have very shapely legs and that is a big part of the body, especially in heels.</p>

		<p>Well this is more proof that black people are superior to white people.  No wonder blacks don&rsquo;t want to be our equals, they (and many facist liberal whites) see themselves as superior by every measure. If you take away white racism, blacks win every time.  Just ask Soledad Obrien.</p>

<p>Make sure you keep scrolling down until you get to the individual pictures.  The white girls are far prettier than the minority girls in these pictures.  And I think that every region of every continent was represented in this pageant.  Was this really a pageant for England?</p>

		<p>In the public vote, &#8220;Ms Christie finished 49th out of the 54 original finalists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this just how multiculturalism works?  The majority of us are against it, but a small cabal of elites decides in favor of the outcome they want.</p>
<p>&#8220;One contestant, quoted anonymously in The Sun newspaper, questioned the &#8220;odd&#8221; judges&rsquo; decision. She said: &#8220;It seems very odd that the overall winner, chosen by the judges, won so few public votes. The competition is far more than just a beauty contest, but it looks like the judges were totally out of touch with the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it is more than just a beauty contest. </p>

<p>Why in these types of competitions, do the &ldquo;Black&rdquo; people always look mostly white???</p>
<p>  &mdash;   The answer is very simple Al:   Mostly all successful so-called &#8220;Blacks&#8221; have White in them.  It&rsquo;s a prerequisite for success in mostly anything other than sports.  Without White genes there would be very little of either beauty or intelligence.  Of course the media here in the U.S. parades all these mulattoes around as &#8220;Black&#8221;.  What the media is actually doing is palming these half-White, half-Black people off as Black.  If the powers that be have their way one day there won&rsquo;t be any pure Whites around.  All our genes will be given to Blacks and they will claim them as their own and say in unison, &#8220;You see we were capable, beautiful and intelligent all along.  It was those evil White people that held us back.&#8221;  We need a movement and we need it now.</p>

<p>Bailey&rsquo;s hair length is just fine for a young woman.  I guess I prefer short or somewhat short hair on a woman rather than the long length popular with women of that age cohort.  This preference was true for me even in high school.</p>
<p>I think I would prefer Julie Christi over Rachel Christi, even with the age difference.  I am old enough to know who Julie is, and the span between my age and Julie&rsquo;s is probably only five years.  The ladies of a certain age can still be appealing.</p>

<p>You think that the mullato winner is better looking that the two runners up?  Not me!  They aren&rsquo;t amazing beauties like Miss DC but they aren&rsquo;t bad.  Rachel Chrisie is hardly even passibly average for a mulatto!  Notice that she has her gown hiked up over her thighs - some class!</p>
<p>Another reason for the whole world to be laughing at England and the UK.  Just how masochistic as the British?<br>

		<p>More importantly read this later report - it was a fix.</p>
<p>Only 9 - yes, 9, members of the public voted for her. She actually came 49th out of 54 contestants. The judges fixed it so that she won.</p>

<p>This is a perfect exaple of what is going on in the UK. they fix a competition so that the black girl won.</p>
<p>No way can they entertain having a Miss England who is actually English.</p>

		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t even aware of this competition, let alone given the opportunity to vote.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get too fired up about it. It certainly hasn&rsquo;t been given a huge amount of attention in the media over here. Beauty contests attract very little interest.</p>
<p>A far, far more important issue is the &#8216;right&rsquo; of Sikh crime victims to have a Sikh police officer appointed to their case. Soon to be extended to other minority groups - ie: whites need not apply.</p>

		<p>This poor woman is a tool by the powers that be that be to promote race mixing.  She may be passably attractive but it&rsquo;s unmixed people who are better looking - they have a better balance of features and nicer colors.  The goal should be to improve your race; not degrade it.</p>

		<p>  The worship of blacks seems to have entered a new phase in formerly Great Britain. The new quadroon looking Miss England is attractive without being beautiful. I&rsquo;d have to chalk this up to British &ldquo;Positive Discrimination&rdquo;. However, the runners up are no great beauties either.  I think they need some new judges for this pageant. </p>
