<h1>&#8216;Racism Isn&rsquo;t the Reason Our Kids Are Failing in School&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tamara Obeng, The Voice (London), July 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>ACADEMICS HAVE long argued that &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo; in Britain&rsquo;s schools is the root cause of black boys failing in the education system. But leading educational consultant and author of Generating Genius, Dr Tony Sewell, argues the &#8216;experts&rsquo; have got it all totally wrong.</p>
<p>In fact, Sewell, director of the Science, Maths and Information Technology Centre at the University of the West Indies says that what black boys are saying to him is the opposite. They are failing because of a variety of problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why was it that we had all these politicians saying that this is to do with black boys being victims when this isn&rsquo;t what they say themselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sewell&rsquo;s new book, Generating Genius, explores the problems of love, ritual and schooling in young black boys.</p>
<p>The book is based on his highly successful project turning 12-year-olds in Jamaica and England into potential scientists. Sewell strongly believes that education is the key to fighting crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think in the UK educationalists have got it all wrong. They want to be seen to be politically correct so what they tend to do is listen to those who tell them it&rsquo;s all about racism. As a result, you get attempts to try and fix white teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sewell&rsquo;s project on the other hand takes a group of youngsters and works with them over a long period of time. He says: &#8220;We&rsquo;ve taken them out of their familiar environment and then they&rsquo;ve developed over four years.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Sewell, love has a lot to do with how black boys fare in education.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kind of love given to the boys is a very strange one. We did some research which showed that girls were doing all the housework. This was the way in which the mother thought she was best showing her love.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the end what actually happens is boys turn out to be lazy and unable to deal with tasks in school and the girls actually do better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The love of a father is central to Sewell&rsquo;s argument; if the father isn&rsquo;t there these boys seek acceptance elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find that a lot of the gangs are a replacement for that love. The people in the gangs in Jamaica are prepared to lay their lives down for &#8216;the don.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s interesting that they would lay their love down for a fellow man. They wouldn&rsquo;t do it for a woman but they&rsquo;re prepared to do it for their male boss,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>Sewell says many believe the reason black people are doing badly is because of dysfunctional families, initiated by slavery.</p>
<p>But, this shouldn&rsquo;t be used as an excuse he says. &#8220;I think you have to take care of your kids. If you have loads of kids you can&rsquo;t excuse not being there for them and say it&rsquo;s because of slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Generating Genius found that the biggest challenge for black youths is not in the classroom, it&rsquo;s on the streets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peer pressure plays a big role in black boys underachieving,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;What our boys have to go through to gain academic success is fighting their peers. How do they say no to an offer to come out and play and instead stay in to study?</p>
<p>&#8220;We in society are so image driven. That&rsquo;s why I put boys in white coats on the front cover. People think boys doing science must be nerds or gay. These boys were highly academic but at the same time very streetwise  &mdash;  they do normal things.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&rsquo;re afraid of is brain power. It&rsquo;s the part of us that&rsquo;s the most powerful but the most neglected. The forces against them are not necessarily the white teacher; the forces against them are people exactly like them.</p>
<p>&#8220;These boys created their own groups, a science gang as their way of protecting each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sewell believes his project provides the quality extra schooling for black boys missing in the education system.</p>
<p>These youths showed promise and potential, with most of them attaining at least nine GCSEs.</p>
<p>UK rapper Bashy in his 2007/2008 single Black Boys states: &#8220;No we ain&rsquo;t hooligans, just young and talented Nubians.&#8221; Generating Genius was developed through this belief.</p>
<p>Sewell added: &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got a situation in the UK where there are hundreds of boys hungry to get on a programme like this. We have not got in the world today a Nobel Prize winner in science.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m convinced that out of this group there will be serious inventors. The boys that we&rsquo;ve got easily could start doing their degrees from now [aged 16].</p>
<p>&#8220;This thing about genius isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s special, you can actually create it. Michael Jackson, Mozart, Tiger Woods, what they had to do in order to become the genius was work really hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever you might say about Joe Jackson, had he not done all those practice sessions with Michael he would never be able to do what he can now. This is why it&rsquo;s called Generating Genius.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project saw groups of 12-year-olds from London and Luton working on high demand at London&rsquo;s Imperial College. Projects also took place in Jamaica, with boys attending summer schools at the University of the West Indies.</p>
<p>Sewell explains: &#8220;They need to have a challenge earlier on and be exposed to things that aren&rsquo;t familiar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still, I don&rsquo;t want to be overly critical of this Sewell gentleman. At least he&rsquo;s pushing hard work and studying to blacks instead of the usual victimhood.  </p>

<p>Bull!  He&rsquo;s twisting the facts to suit his thesis and wants to sell books or he&rsquo;s just another leftist oddball wanting to tout the party line.</p>
<p>Intelligence has very little to do with environment and it will not change no matter what is attempted.  These people are so afraid of rioting blacks they&rsquo;re willing to prostitute themselves to any theory that will pretend they are on a par with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so VERY disgusting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Racism&#8221; isn&rsquo;t the issue. Race, genetics, heredity, DNA, genes, and IQ are.</p>

<p>&#8220;Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement,&#8221; by John Ogbu, a Nigerian-born US scholar, that describes how well-to-do Shaker Heights, Ohio does more than mortal man can to get blacks up to par in school, and still they fail.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; is a near-obsession in this pinko suburb, but try as the might blacks still lag.  It&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;d call a page-turner, but for folks who frequent these pages it&rsquo;s worth a try.</p>

		<p>While there is obviously some truth hidden herein, this sounds, in the final analysis, distressingly like the American Conservative movement&rsquo;s patent, &#8220;if only young Blacks had better home environments eveything would be fine&#8221; mantra. We must be careful about promoting such false and empty hopes just because they go against the typical liberal ideal. One racial fantasy is ultimately as fraudulent as the other - it doesn&rsquo;t matter which side of the political spectrum it derives from.    </p>

Although this latest black educational huckster Tony Sewell isn&rsquo;t quite as vile as <i>most</i> black educational hucksters, I still believe that very many of these &#8220;12-year-olds in Jamaica and England&#8221; are capable of <i>realizing</i> this purported &#8220;potential&#8221; (the operative word here) to be &#8220;scientists.&#8221; I&rsquo;ve read too much about Race and IQ, both here on AmRen and elsewhere, to be conned by that one anymore. </p>
<p>I appreciate that Sewell is making a sincere effort to uplift his race; I merely don&rsquo;t think that uplifting can, to any great extent, be accomplished   &mdash;   either by his methods or anyone else&rsquo;s. Sewell&rsquo;s methods may help curb black failure somewhat, but they will NEVER close the black-white achievement gap because that gap has been imposed by thousands of years of differential evolution between those two races. Expecting to reverse, in a few years, differences that took millennia to accrue, is a fool&rsquo;s errand. </p>
<p>But more than anything else, what I&rsquo;d like to point out is that Sewell   &mdash;   along with everybody else under the spell of Multiculti witchcraft   &mdash;   accepts it as completely normal and unquestionable that these Jamaican youths are in England in the first place. It is NOT normal; it was NOT somehow inevitable; and it was NOT something that &#8220;just happened.&#8221; The situation was the result of very specific changes in immigration policy enacted by the British government (although without the consent of the British people, needless to say). It was due to a man-made change to a man-made law   &mdash;   and man-made decisions and laws can be reversed. </p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the crucial distinction: A law made by man (e.g. immigration policy) can be unmade; a law made by Nature, or if you prefer, God (the IQ gap and all the myriad problems that flow from that gap) cannot. </p>
<p>If Dr Sewell thinks he can fix the brains of 12-year-olds Jamaicans, let him do it in Jamaica and with Jamaican tax money. Underachievement and criminality of Caribbean teenagers should not be the problem of Britain, Australia, Canada, the US (no shortage of West Indians in NYC!), or any other historically White country. </p>

<p>Sewell skimmed a few off the high end of the bell curve, gave them discipline and a positive environment, and is getting promising results.  Congratulations.  Let&rsquo;s see him replicate this feat with a random selection&hellip;</p>
<p>IQ is largely immutable.  &#8220;Generating Genious&#8221; with respect to IQ is not possible with our current technology.  Now, if you go with the liberal idea of genious- that someone who is really really good at a motor skill is a genious (ala Tiger Woods or MJ)- then yes, you can generate genious.  It&rsquo;s called practice, and anyone can improve on almost any motor skill if they practice it enough.</p>
<p>Being an inventor or accomplished scientist?  Not motor skills.  Will his pre selected little geniouses in training accompish great feats of science and engineering?  I truly hope they do, after all I don&rsquo;t care who finds the cure for cancer or invents the next best mouse trap, but there is many a slip &#8216;twixt a cup and a lip.  High IQ is only part of the puzzle.  They must resist temptation, practice self discipline, choose their friends wisely, not end up with 5 baby mamas, etc&hellip;  And, be lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>High IQ people of all races tend to drift towards the top of their respective professions/societies anyway.  The good from this study is that it is not following the tired and worn out &#8220;blame whitey&#8221; script.</p>

		<p>This Sewell guy may be right, but it&rsquo;s the same old made up &#8216;science&rsquo;. Another researcher in another town has black boys saying the complete opposite thing. Actually I bet there are about 100 &#8216;sociologists&rsquo; reporting facts completely opposite of the ones Sewell finds.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how successful his program will be. But if he is encouraging students to work hard and study then I think it&rsquo;s a good thing. I doubt it will bring them up to the level of everyone else. But it has to be better than joining gangs and goofing off.</p>

		<p>At least this is a modest step in the right direction. For the longest period of time, the egalitarians would not even admit that some cultures were better than others. More recently, I have heard some grudgingly admit that yes, black culture is a problem  &mdash;  but that&rsquo;s just a few bad apples and anyways, lets get back to the main problem of white racism.</p>
<p>Perhaps finally we can see the third step  &mdash;  egalitarians and academics wondering aloud if black culture is entirely to blame, and white racism is a minor or non-existent factor in black failure. This is still not really correct of course, without a discussion of genetics; but at least we can start talking about solutions. </p>
<p>For example, if exposure to a rotten culture is the primary problem, then the obvious solution must be to separate and isolate black children from the problem, perhaps with a radically different style of school for black boys. Probably a military style academy from an extremely young age, with only occasional contact with the outside world. And of course, affirmative action and hiring quotas would no longer have a leg to stand on. I do not think something like this would make blacks equal, but the problem can be more manageable than it is now. Crime statistics and anecdotal evidence from the pre-civil rights era prove it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the &#8220;it&rsquo;s a rotten culture&#8221; meme will catch on among egalitarians without stiff resistance though. Perhaps in 20~30 years. Why? Because it will be a last-ditch attempt to fend off the tidal waves of evidence pouring in from genetic science. Anyone left arguing &#8220;all cultures are equal&#8221; or &#8220;a few bad apples&#8221; will seem laughably quaint.</p>

		<p>What I&rsquo;ve been saying all along: Freud got it right. The only problem is that, for most black men, the only thing that they could teach the next generation is how to get over on the White civilization. Culture is a function of race, not vice versa.</p>

		<p>I was just remarking to myself that I&rsquo;ve never heard a good definition of &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;.  Well, I did a Google search and found Wikipedia&rsquo;s page on it.  Aside from the usual blather on racism, they have few hard examples of it today in America.  The best they can come up with is poor healthcare (as if blacks will use better care - I&rsquo;ve read that they don&rsquo;t trust doctors as it is) and used textbooks in predominately black schools.</p>
<p>I wish these racist, and I do mean RACIST Leftists of all colors would actually define their terms, but they don&rsquo;t want to because that&rsquo;s part of the game.  Call anyone anything negative if they don&rsquo;t conform, just to smear them.</p>
<p>Like the woman fired from NYC government, I am sick of all the charges that &#8220;white people&#8221; are &#8220;evil racists&#8221;.</p>
