<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8130624.stm">Three Die in Karnataka Violence</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, July 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least three people have been killed in violent clashes between mobs of Hindus and Muslims in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.</p>
<p>Two people died in the riots in the city of Mysore and a third was killed when police opened fire.</p>
<p>Violence began when the carcass of a pig was thrown into a mosque. A curfew has been imposed in the affected areas.</p>
<p>Mysore has a significant Muslim population and police say it has a history of religious strife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some miscreants threw the carcass of a pig in the mosque. People gathered in large numbers and protested,&#8221; senior police officer VS D&rsquo;souza told the BBC.</p>
<p>Correspondents say pitched battles were fought between Hindu and Muslim mobs before police opened fire to disperse the rioters.</p>
<p>Several people have been arrested, police said.</p>
<p>A curfew has been imposed in the riot-affected areas and schools and colleges have been ordered shut until 4 July.</p>
<p>Karnataka is the only southern state ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
<p>Last year, more than 20 churches in the state were desecrated by the hardline Hindu group Bajrang Dal.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s leader in the state, Mahendra Kumar, was arrested after he admitted that his group had carried out the initial attacks on churches.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not worried one bit about this type of violence. By 2040 Whites will be a minority in America and the world will suddenly become a safe and harmonious love fest between the races.</p>

<p>Nor will they ever get along, in spite of the multiculturalist propaganda.</p>

		<p> This is yet another example of a universal human characteristic: You side with those who are like you; you are likely to clash with those who aren&rsquo;t like you. The liberals can talk all they want to about us being &#8220;all alike,&#8221; and suchlike hooey, but that fact remains.</p>
<p> The Muslims have shown their bitter intolerance for and hatred of others not like them the world over during the past 30 years or so. The Hindus in Karnataka have shown they can be just as intolerant, desecrating both mosques and churches. But intolerance shows at least one positive thing: Where there is such a clash, people at least believe in something. That&rsquo;s more than you can say about far too many of us Caucasian Americans nowadays.</p>

		<p>actually there are at least 30 different violent secessionist movements in India -I would not blame solely muslims - but if any country is an example of how ungovernable and how unliveable multicultural societies are it is &#8220;India&#8221;. </p>

		<p>What muslims in India don&rsquo;t realize is that their ancestors were Hindus who were forced to convert to Islam, a religion they hated, on pain of death.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very true. But they don&rsquo;t want to know it.  It&rsquo;s also very true that Moslems don&rsquo;t believe that anything of importance happened BEFORE Islam,  and for them the arrival of Islam was like the start of history.   So anything prior to that was negligible, unimportant, and remains mostly unknown. People back then, pre-Islam,  were living in a state of primitive benightedness.  History begins with Islam.</p>
<p>A special exception would have to be Egypt, because the times of the pharaohs were Egypt&rsquo;s ONLY real glory.  Also, a lot of international prestige   &mdash;   and tourist dollars   &mdash;   come from exploiting ancient Egypt.  To an extent, this could be said for Persia too, at least it was during the time of the Shah, much less so now.</p>
<p>When I took geology, there were a number of Arab/Turkish/Iranian students in the class. The professor was describing the eruption of Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii. [This event was described in detail, minute by minute, by the historian/naturalist Pliny the Younger.]   One of them asked, skeptically, how we could possibly  know such things from so long ago.  The professor replied that it was all written down by the Roman scientists and historians who left us very detailed records.  These students (<i>university</i>students, I emphasize!!)  were incredulous!  They couldn&rsquo;t imagine that Rome had historians, writers, libraries!   They could hardly belive it.  I suppose they didn&rsquo;t know that Romans could even write (?)   &mdash;    at least they obviously never thought about it. Apparently, they had supposed that the Romans were little more than primitive cavemen.   Up until  the arrival of Islam, of course!  That&rsquo;s when civilization began.  </p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s their official story that they&rsquo;ve been indoctrinated with.  It was an astonishing moment (for me) to encounter their utterly different point of view, their total ignorance of this matter.</p>
<p>No wonder they believe that all the glories and achievements  of Mediterranean civilization were the product of Islam  (a point of view that we hear incessantly today). They barely heard of anything that went before it   &mdash;    the foundations of culture  that Islam actually appropriated from others.</p>
