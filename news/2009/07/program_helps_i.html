			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Faye Flam, Philadelphia Inquirer, July 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As part of an attempt to fight crime, Philadelphia is now the subject of an experiment never tried in another city: A computer is forecasting who among the city&rsquo;s 49,000 parolees is likeliest to rob, assault, or kill someone.</p>
<p>Since March, the city&rsquo;s Adult Probation and Parole Department has been using the system to reshuffle the way it assigns cases. Each time someone new comes through intake, a clerk enters his or her name and the computer takes just seconds to fish through a database for relevant information and deliver a verdict of high, medium, or low risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a complete paradigm shift for the department,&#8221; said chief probation and parole officer Robert Malvestuto. &#8220;Science has made this available to us. We&rsquo;d be foolish not to use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The controversy over the new system cuts to the heart of a long-standing debate: whether parole agencies should control dangerous people or help them reclaim their lives.</p>
<p>The computer isn&rsquo;t merely crunching data  &mdash;  it is creating its own rules in what is known as &#8220;machine learning,&#8221; a fast-growing technology that enables computers to encroach into the human realms of judgment and decision-making.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The computer doesn&rsquo;t use a formula, nor does it develop one that anyone could write down. Instead, it learns by itself after being fed reams of &#8220;training data,&#8221; in this case on past parolees and their subsequent crimes. The system looks for patterns that connect such factors with subsequent crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To &#8220;train&#8221; the system, Berk [University of California statistician Richard Berk, an expert in machine &#8220;learning&#8221;] fed in data on 30,000 past cases; about 1 percent had committed homicide or attempted homicide within two years of beginning probation or parole.</p>
<p>The data included the number and types of past crimes, sex, race, income, and other factors.</p>
<p>To test its power, he fed in a different set of data on 30,000 other parolees. This time he didn&rsquo;t tell the computer who would go on to kill.</p>
<p>Applying what it had previously learned, the system identified a group of several hundred who were considered especially dangerous. Of those, 45 in 100 did commit a homicide or attempted homicide within two years  &mdash;  much higher than the 1 in 100 among the general population of probationers and parolees.</p>
<p>The predictors that mattered most were age, age at first contact with adult courts, prior crimes involving guns, being male, and past violent crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Race mattered only a little  &mdash;  and so Philadelphia decided to leave it out of the equation. Berk said he thinks the model should work fine without it and the decision to ignore race minimizes concerns about racial profiling.</p>

		<p>This is the same kind of algorithm that many e-mail programs use do discern what is or is not spam   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s called a Bayesian program.</p>
<p>Since this is the universe of criminal convicts, it might actually be the case where race might not come into play as much as it does the other factors that the program uses, or in other venues of life.  White felons and black felons both have tendencies of recidivism, but the gap between the two is probably not as big as the gap between white crime rates and black crime rates overall.</p>

		<p>Race only mattered &#8220;a little.&#8221; Compare that with the precise statistics used in preceding paragraphs of the article. Dr. Berk hit the nail on the head, this is about fear of accusations of &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;. </p>

<p>So once again, political-correctness trumps any real desire in obtaining conclusive evidence in their wholly inadequate study. Ignoring race as a major &#8220;ingredient&#8221; is equivalent to leaving yeast out of the process of baking bread that ends with flat results for both.  </p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely these pseudo-scientists would even consider a DNA study as seen in this report. </p>

<p>In the absence of any other information about an individual, this would obviously be a false statement.  But here they are used very powerful predictors of criminality on a set of people that already have criminal records.  So they are most likely correct in their statement.  Still, if all one cared about was getting the most accurate predictions, then race would have been a helpful field to include in the database.  Of course there is some PC occurring here.</p>

		<p>There is in statistics the notion of a &#8220;surrogate measure&#8221;.  When you can&rsquo;t measure   something directly, you measure something else that has a known statistical relationship with the unmeasurable thing, and calculate it with a useful degree of accuracy.  This is what insurance companies and credit agencies do.  This is why Blacks with incomes of 75K have worse credit ratings than the average White who makes 35K.  If they have enough information, they don&rsquo;t need to enter the race of the offender because the racial characteristics will shine through the numbers.  </p>

		<p>To #4 - Anonymous&hellip;that was an excellent article, including some of the most stupid statements by the opponents of Frudakis&rsquo; DNAWitness.  The black special prosecutor who wishes he could make the technology disappear - and thus have more unsolved rapes and murders because police look for the wrong kind of suspects, like the highlighted case in Baton Rouge.  Disgusting.</p>
