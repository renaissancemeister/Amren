			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Welsh and Doug Smith, Los Angeles Times, July 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Los Angeles Police Department&rsquo;s online crime map intended for public use has failed to include nearly 40% of serious crimes reported in the city, a Times analysis has found.</p>
<p>The omissions, which date back at least six months, include thousands of crimes known to LAPD officials and are included in their official crime statistics.</p>
<p>Among the 19,000 incidents between Jan. 1 and June 13 that do not appear at <a href="https://lapdcrimemaps.org/">lapdcrimemaps.org</a>:</p>
<p>* 26 homicides</p>
<p>* 137 rapes</p>
<p>* 10,766 personal, vehicle or other nonviolent thefts</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lapses mean that the map, touted by city leaders as an important and innovative resource for city residents to determine whether their neighborhoods are safe, presents a drastically incomplete image of city crime.</p>
<p>Some residents have tried to bring the problem to the department&rsquo;s attention, to no avail. Jason Insalaco, a former resident of Atwater Village who uses the pen name GlendaleBlvd, posted a message about unmapped crimes in that area on a neighborhood message board earlier this year, but his concerns were dismissed by the department. He said he was outraged by the site&rsquo;s inaccuracies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The community is not being accurately informed,&#8221; Insalaco said. &#8220;They are being misled and lulled into a false sense of security.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Times discovered the magnitude of the problem while developing its own online map to display LAPD data. Comparing the LAPD map with the department&rsquo;s official totals revealed that thousands of crimes through mid-June were missing. The department&rsquo;s official crime tally recorded more than 52,000 serious crimes this year. But the database on the public mapping site contained fewer than 33,000 for the same period.</p>
<p>Among the omissions, caused by a programming error, were more than a thousand violent robberies, including two out of seven street robberies committed in April and May by men posing as police officers.</p>
<p>The Times informed the LAPD last week of the discrepancy and specific examples of missing crimes.</p>
<p>This week, the LAPD added about 20,000 crimes from 2009 to data it provides The Times. But as of late Wednesday, those additions had yet to appear on the LAPD map.</p>
<p>&#8220;The department is looking into the issue that you brought to our attention,&#8221; said Lt. Rick Banks, the officer in charge of the online unit. &#8220;When we come up with our findings, we will respond to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The missing crimes mark the second major problem with the LAPD&rsquo;s public maps. In April, The Times found that programming errors by the LAPD&rsquo;s contractor had caused thousands of crimes to be mapped in the wrong place, mistakenly portraying the Los Angeles Civic Center as the most crime-ridden location in the city. To resolve the problem, the contractor has dropped those crimes from the map, but has not yet placed them in their correct locations.</p>

		<p>Computer error makes L.A. seem safer than it is.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it. Now I get why L.A. Mayor Villaraigosa said that Los Angeles is safer now than it was in 1954. Honest, he said that. It turns out he was misinformed, and since I criticzed him, I am going to have to write him an apology  &mdash;  some year.</p>

		<p>First mayor Villaraigosa makes LA a sanctuary city where illegal aliens are protected from arrest.</p>
<p>Then when crime skyrockets the mayor claims the city is safer than it was back in the 50&rsquo;s. He presents improved crime rate stats that turn out to be in &#8220;error&#8221; because the chicanos in charge accidentaly (cough, cough) forgot to include 40% of the crimes committed!</p>

Computers don&rsquo;t make errors. Programs cause errors. Bad data cause bad results. <br>

		<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, they use similar tactics in U.K. and South Africa.  Wherever &#8220;people of color&#8221; run wild in the streets, the powers that be use tricks to mask reality.</p>

		<p>This was no error.</p>
<p>What is shocking is that the LA Times reported it.   I no longer receive the LA Times so I don&rsquo;t know if it was buried in the back pages of the Metro section or featured on the front page (doesn&rsquo;t matter to me, I&rsquo;ll never subscribe again).  Maybe they figure at this point they have nothing to lose as their original subscriber base has either fled the state or canceled their subscriptions due to the Times&rsquo; anti-White, leftist bias.  My colleagues tell me that the LA Times is now light as a feather, including the Sunday edition.</p>
<p>The groups they pander to  &mdash;  welfare recipients, illegal aliens, uneducated NAMs,  Section 8 dwellers  &mdash;  cannot read the 4th-grade level writing.</p>
<p>On another interesting note, Brimelow over at VDare.com recently had a fund raising drive and reported that donors from California (including me) were over-represented.  This is because we are on the front lines of the invasion and have witnessed the destruction of our state from Third World degradation, rising crime, wrecked neighborhoods, wretched schools  &mdash;  all of this with the encouragement from low g-loaded puppet politicians such as villaraigossa (follow the money for the real string pullers).  On top of this, we are forced to fund our own displacement (our car tax just went up, almost doubled, and now the legislature wants to add an additional $15/car).</p>
<p>Our choice is either to barricade ourselves behind high walls or gates (as the politicians do) or leave the state.</p>
<p>Scharzengger also tells us that we carry 30% of the welfare population in the entire country  &mdash;  and that we now &#8216;must do something.&rsquo;  Well, what does he expect when we&rsquo;ve had years of unfettered Third World immigration with a population marked by high birth rates, high crime rates, low IQs, school failure  &mdash;  on into the 4th generation, while the producers and businesses in this state have been driven out due to satanic taxes, wretched schools and an anti-White political climate.</p>
<p>It is far too late for us, but maybe not for you.  Please let this be a warning to those in other states  &mdash;  this is coming your way, and fast.</p>
<p>Bon, 10 years clean of the LA Times</p>

		<p>You can bet that the stats are far worse than what the city is now admitting. Living and working in L.A., I can tell you the city is far more dangerous now than just ten years ago. I&rsquo;ve been living here since I was a small child in the 1960&rsquo;s. The bald-face lying by officials, from the Feds on down, when it comes to crime in L.A. and in fact the entire US should be a capital offense. </p>

		<p>Considering the workforce pool in the area and EEO hiring preferences, it very likely IS an error. However, the error is that it&rsquo;s likely twice as many missing as they &#8216;claim&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Call it &#8220;just wondering&#8221;&hellip; but HOW MUCH crime by Blacks and Hispanics is reduced through the subterfuge of computer error or human error inputing data? We&rsquo;re expected to believe members of racial minorities are no more crime-prone than Whites&hellip; yet the constant evidence with respect to violent crime in the news tends to show that lie up for what it really is.</p>
<p>What is it with our liberal fools? That they&rsquo;re so dead set on trying to foister their warped idealism on the rest of us. We KNOW from reality what the real crime picture is. 90% of violent crime can be blamed on our two largest minorities   &mdash;   Blacks and Hispanics.</p>
