<h1>Black Philadelphia Police Sue Over Message Board, Say It&rsquo;s Racist</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Kessler, CNN, July 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of black Philadelphia police officers filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against their department, alleging an online forum geared toward city police is &#8220;infested with racist, white supremacist and anti-African-American content.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit alleges white officers post on and moderate the privately operated site, Domelights.com, both on and off the job.</p>
<p>Domelights&rsquo; users &#8220;often joke about the racially offensive commentary on the site .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or will mention them in front of black police officers,&#8221; thus creating &#8220;a racially hostile work environment,&#8221; according to lawyers for the all-black Guardian Civic League, the lead plaintiff in the suit.</p>
<p>A look at the site&rsquo;s forums Friday for racist comments found several possibilities.</p>
<p>Reads one: &#8220;In urban areas, it seems [African-Americans] living on welfare in paid for housing is ingrained in their culture as well as fighting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Kids, along with adults can&rsquo;t speak proper English or spell at a 3rd grade level, but they can sing among &#8220;theyselves&#8221; the lyrics to a rap song.&#8221;</p>
<p>Said another Domelights user of an African-American woman: &#8220;She is a classic example of that exact non tax paying, no car insurance driving, bad weave wearing, all the whitey&rsquo;s are racist black women.&#8221;</p>
<p>The site&rsquo;s tagline is &#8220;the voice of the good guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time African-Americans do or say something in our city, we get this backlash of cops who think they&rsquo;re anonymous on this Web site  &mdash;  just racist, nasty, hurtful things about what we do,&#8221; said Rochelle Bilal, the president of the Guardian Civic League and a 23-year veteran of the force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve heard the same story over and over again, which is that [African-American officers] witness in the workplace Domelights being used and discussed [in a racial manner],&#8221; said Brian Mildenberg, whose firm is also representing several campers from a mostly black Philadelphia day camp that recently gained national attention when its members were turned away from a swim club.</p>
<p>He said it was &#8220;a gift from the heavens in a way that the two things happened at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Mildenberg and Bilal said they had been monitoring the 10-year-old Web site for years, the pool incident did seem to play into the timing of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they said something about our pretty, brown, young, innocent children and called them monkeys because they wanted to go swimming, that was enough,&#8221; Bilal said.</p>
<p>She may have been referring to this comment posted on Domelights: &#8220;Maybe the people who work for a living didn&rsquo;t want to swim with a bunch of ghetto monkey faces.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ideally, Mildenberg said, his clients would like to see the site shut down. Failing that, they want Philadelphia police officers to be prohibited from posting comments on the site, particularly during working hours.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the class-action suit also are seeking unspecified financial damages available under the Civil Rights Act for Philadelphia&rsquo;s 2,300 African-American police officers, according to Mildenberg.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>That gives me a clue that blacks and/or left-wingers are trolling Domelights and posting the most provocative comments, including the one about the monk-y.  As for everything else, I mean, where do they get a crazy idea that blacks are somehow linked to crime?</p>
<p>Shutting the site down is going to be impossible, and almost as impossible will be proving that any cops posted to the site.</p>

		<p>Great. We have moron black cops who don&rsquo;t know what freedom of speech is. The only part of the Constitution they might know is &#8220;equal protection&#8221;. </p>
<p>On second thought, they don&rsquo;t know that either because none of them have ever read the constitution. They don&rsquo;t want equality-they want white cops out. </p>
<p>Well, all the white owned real estate owner and bankers who pay the city&rsquo;s bills up there in Philly will love it with an all black police force. What will happen to property values in the Citay of Brudderly Luv?  </p>

		<p>     These miscreants should be fired,jailed re-educated. Then reparations should be given to all blacks fot this outrage. Then the Jews should be compensated. Mexicans and Latinos should get paid too. These White devils are too much. What did they ever do for civilization?

		<p>Most of the comments were just telling the truth! I do take exception with the guy who wrote the &#8220;monkey face&#8221; comment. I understand where he is coming from since he has obviously had to deal with blacks on a day to day intimate level as a police officer. I think calling kids names will never make anyone come over to our side and hear the truth. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Domelights Rule #112: It is racist to make any kind of distinction between races that does not show blacks in a positive light.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is really the truth.  Politicians can make constant reference to race as long as they are talking about showing preference to blacks or handing out affirmative action jobs or otherwise complimenting blacks.  </p>
<p>It is also ok to have an entire organization based on race as long as the organization is for blacks, by blacks, promoting blacks or attacking whites.  </p>

		<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s the real reason for this &#8220;outrage&#8221; of Whitey not wanting blacks swimming in the same pool&hellip;That last paragraph. Pay up Whitey!</p>
<p>As for the black police officers being &#8220;hurt&#8221; or whatever, I am most sure that they say WORSE things about Whitey in and off the net.  Maybe it&rsquo;s time to start tracking all the violations of OUR civil rights from blacks? Think we got a few cases?</p>

		<p>Rocelle Billal is the president of the all Black Guardian Civic League and she stated that she has been monitoring the Domelights<br/>
 web site for years.Why?  Who has been monitoring the all black guardian civic league?Did someone force Rocelle to go to that web site?When she saw things that offended her why did she go back?Is she certain that none of her black members have ever expressed any racist views?When they are gathered together in their all black meetings can we be sure that these black officers always present themselves honorably?Is having an all black organization proof that they only care about blacks?The very idea that in the year 2009 we still have segregated one race civc leagues.Every position in the Guardian Civic league is chaired by blacks from the president on down.We need to integrate this organization to truely reflect all the officers.Where are all the multicults when you need them?Nothing but the sound of crickets.Blacks can&rsquo;t stand to see whites have anything of their own so they seek to destroy them from within.Maybe its time for a new strategy in as much as whites wouldn&rsquo;t want to join the black group for the sake of our future we need to go and learn about our enemy!</p>

<p>The full quotation, <a href="http://www.domelights.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=31629" rel="nofollow">here</a>, is rather interesting:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The Creative Steps Daycare that is suing the Valley Swim Club owes the state of Pennsylvania and the IRS in excess of $100,000 dollars. This is documented in the Philadelphia civil Dockets that can be accessed by the public. There are 20 active dockets of unpaid judgements including 2 to the IRS each in excess of $40,000 each. Alethea Wright herself has 4 dockets listed including a judgement against her for a car accident of about $9,000, that means no insurance. She has all the motive in the world to file a frivilous lawsuit against an innocent club. She also is familiar with this club as she has lived in this &#8220;white&#8221; neighborhood. She claims she just wants what&rsquo;s right, well pay your taxes b*tch. She claims that white people have stereotyped black people, well she is a classic example of that exact non tax paying, no car insurance driving, bad weave wearing, all the whitey&rsquo;s are racists black women.&#8221;</i></p>

		<p>How can they sue the police department over what occurs on a private forum? The police department is responsible for controlling what its members say on a private site? I suppose they think the First Amendment doesn&rsquo;t apply when blacks are offended. I don&rsquo;t expect them to lose this one. </p>

		<p>Well, here we go again. Looks like the Valley Club incident&rsquo;s starting to take on a life of its own. Now whites can&rsquo;t associate anywhere, not even online, not even anonymously. Nor can we enjoy freedom of speech, not if in doing so we sometime, somewhere create a &#8220;hostile work environment&#8221; for nonwhites. </p>
<p>What the police do on their own time is really nobody else&rsquo;s business, anyway. If it&rsquo;s done on the job, there might be a case for disciplining them if the blogging or commenting interferes with their work. But I&rsquo;d be willing to wager that getting a chance to blow off steam actually helps them do their jobs better. I&rsquo;m sure that if anyone needs an outlet for pent-up frustrations, it&rsquo;s the Philly cops. Denying them the opportunity may lead to their taking out their frustrations later on the very people who are complaining about the web site.</p>

		<p>Have these people ever heard of freedom of speech? The truth hurts doesn&rsquo;t it? They talk about a class action law suit with  financial damages. NOW we get the real motive here. It&rsquo;s all about getting paid to these people. They also mention these poor brown innocent children in the swim club case. Catch up with these same kids 10 years from now, and I&rsquo;ll bet you a hundred bucks 90 percent of them will have an arrest record. Any takers?</p>

		<p>  Sue away.  So sue me.  Go ahead&hellip;make my day.  When there ain&rsquo;t no money, you can&rsquo;t sue.  One of the (many) positive sides of the economic debacle we are in is the fact that lawsuits mean nothing when there is no money to be had.  And the lawyers start getting scarce too.  Talk to lawyers sometime.  They will tell you that their work is slowing down.  Municipal governments are running out of money big time.  Police departments, especially those in bigger cities, are out of money.  There ain&rsquo;t no money.  HA HA HA.  </p>

		<p>I have been reading this site for sometime. If you look around there you will find this statement:<br/>
Quote:<br/>
Forum for interaction, information exchange and friendly debate among police officers and law enforcement agents, as well as their friends and supporters. Focused on issues affecting the Philadelphia Police Department and other law enforcement agencies in the Philadelphia region. </p>
<p>And this:<br/>
The forum that enables firefighters and paramedics to give voice to their wide array of opinions regarding their profession. The forum is moderated by firefighters, for the use and enjoyment <br/>
of firefighters, paramedics, and their supporters. </p>
<p>Also this:<br/>
Dedicated to the men and women of our armed forces, past and present, along with the families and friends whose support and love is unwavering.  </p>
<p>It seems to me that the only thing these offices did wrong was posting on the site during working hours. </p>
<p>Nowhere does it state that this is a white only site. Nowhere on that site does it state that.  It appears to me that anybody can post here.  There was no exclusion of blacks If blacks wanted to post there, there is nothing to stop them. There probably did post there as internet &#8220;trolls&#8221;, Just like they perpetuate &#8220;hate crime hoaxes&#8221; ala Tawana Brawley and Madonna Constantine among others to cash in on the ghetto lottery or whatever other nefarious motivations blacks have so they can &#8220;stick it to the man.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, this reminds me of a Parade that took place in Rockaway Beach, New York which is almost all Irish. The T.V. News reported that a few members of the NYPD and FDNY had participated in the Parade, wearing Black face make-up and holding watermelons.  </p>
<p>You know that Al Shakedown got into the picture, and Demanded the Cops and Firemen be fired from their jobs. Several were repremanded, but a few lost their jobs. </p>

		<p>Philadelphia blacks won&rsquo;t be happy until the city is 100% black and of course the police force is 100% black. Well, then you have the demographics of Zimbabwe, right?</p>
<p>I went hunting last year with 6 cops from a surburban police force. The town is mostly a bedroom community and 90% white. Their comments around the nightly campfire sounded just like domelights. Why is that?</p>
<p>They still spend the vast majority of their time and energy in the one area where the &#8220;people of color&#8221; live and spawn their gang-banger children. </p>
<p>This thing must be genetic or something.</p>

&ldquo;Rocelle Billal is the president of the all Black Guardian Civic League and she stated that she has been monitoring the Domelights&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but isn&rsquo;t Billal or Bilal the name of the mad Black scientist who, according to the deslusional psychotic mind of Louis Farrakhan, invented White people in an experiment gone wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Yakub&#8221; is their fantasy character who invented Whites on an island by breeding fair-skinned mulattoes. The NOI is mental.</p>

		<p>To anybody that might be interested I suggest reading the book, Race, Evolution, and Behavior, by J. Philippe Rushton. I think you may find out why you know what you already know, and what everybody already knows.</p>

I don&rsquo;t get it. So if this site is not hosted or sponsored by the police department, why are they on the hook for it? And how is it anyone can tell the Police Department to order officers not to post on it on their own time? <br/>

<p>Members of police departments are generally forbidden to have anything to do with &#8220;racist&#8221; or other such organizations. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s constitutional, but that&rsquo;s the rule.</p>
<p>Also, police officers are considered, technically, to be always &#8220;on duty&#8221;. This makes it complicated. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I do take exception with the guy who wrote the &ldquo;monkey face&rdquo; comment. I understand where he is coming from  [but]&hellip; I think calling kids names will never make anyone come over to our side and hear the truth. &#8221; <br/>

<p>You are right. But these are cops, not diplomats. </p>
<p>Incidentally, we have seen Rochelle Bilal&rsquo;s name here before.  She was involved when that young rookie made his indiscrete comments to the female journalism student who was riding in his car.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Sue away. So sue me. Go ahead…make my day. When there ain&rsquo;t no money, you can&rsquo;t sue&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Be careful what you wish for.  There may be no money, but they&rsquo;ll go after your job, your reputation, your wealth (however meager) and any property you might own.  And they will stop at nothing until they utterly destroy you.</p>
<p>Many of these &#8216;aggrieved&rsquo; non-Whites are backed by powerful, influential race- or ethnic-based groups that have plenty of money and won&rsquo;t hesitate to use it against anyone or anything they don&rsquo;t like.  They are vicious and vindictive and I believe they enjoy destroying Whites and Western Civilization.  Examples of such are the ACLU, ADL and $PLC.  BTW:  If you are White, these groups will NEVER come to YOUR defense even if you are raped, robbed or murdered by non-Whites. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Have these people ever heard of freedom of speech&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What Freedom of Speech?  It didn&rsquo;t work well for Fuzzy Zoeller, Michael Richards, Don Imus or that idiot Trent Lott, did it?  All have had their careers and reputations either destroyed or heavily damaged.  If I (as a White) tried to say openly the same venom I hear spewed every single day by non-Whites against Whites, I would lose my job and pension on the spot.  Freedom of Speech is only for non-Whites.</p>

<p>Who would come to my rescue, the head of the Justice Department, Eric Holder?  The one that is trying to ram through Hate-thought Legislation against Whites?  The one that has openly stated that enhanced hate penalties do not apply to crimes committed against Whites?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the government sets its sights on the Internet.  George Orwell was right when he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act&hellip;&#8221;</p>
