			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Edwards, Telegraph (London), July 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Analysis of figures from the European Commission showed a 77 per cent increase in murders, robberies, assaults and sexual offences in the UK since Labour came to power.</p>
<p>The total number of violent offences recorded compared to population is higher than any other country in Europe, as well as America, Canada, Australia and South Africa.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders said the disclosures were a &#8220;damning indictment&#8221; of the Government&rsquo;s failure to tackle deep-rooted social problems.</p>
<p>The figures combined crime statistics for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The UK had a greater number of murders in 2007 than any other EU country  &mdash;  927  &mdash;  and at a relative rate higher than most western European neighbours, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>It also recorded the fifth highest robbery rate in the EU, and the highest absolute number of burglaries, with double the number of offences recorded in Germany and France.</p>
<p>Overall, 5.4 million crimes were recorded in the UK in 2007  &mdash;  more than 10 a minute  &mdash;  second only to Sweden.</p>
<p>Chris Grayling, shadow home secretary, said: &#8220;This is a real damning indictment of this government&rsquo;s comprehensive failure over more than a decade to tackle the deep rooted social problems in our society, and the knock-on effect on crime and anti-social behaviour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re now on our fourth Home Secretary in this parliament, and all we are getting is a rehash of old initiatives that didn&rsquo;t work the first time round. More than ever Britain needs a change of direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The figures were sourced from Eurostat, the European Commission&rsquo;s database of statistics. They are gathered using official sources in the countries concerned such as the national statistics office, the national prison administration, ministries of the interior or justice, and police.</p>
<p>A breakdown of the statistics, which were compiled into league tables by the Conservatives, revealed that violent crime in the UK had increased from 652,974 offences in 1998 to more than 1.15 million crimes in 2007.</p>
<p>It means there are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the UK, making it the most violent place in Europe.</p>
<p>Austria is second, with a rate of 1,677 per 100,000 people, followed by Sweden, Belgium, Finland and Holland.</p>
<p>By comparison, America has an estimated rate of 466 violent crimes per 100,000 population.</p>
<p>France recorded 324,765 violent crimes in 2007  &mdash;  a 67 per cent increase in the past decade  &mdash;  at a rate of 504 per 100,000 population.</p>
<p>The Home Office says there has been a downtrend in overall violence for the past decade.</p>
<p>But last October it emerged that levels of violent crime in England and Wales had been underestimated for more than a decade because of a blunder in recording methods.</p>
<p>Ministers admitted that some police forces had not been recording offences of grievous bodily harm with intent as serious violent crime. When the offences were included violent crime figures immediately increased by a fifth.</p>
<p>Separate figures disclosed in May showed that the number of people requiring hospital treatment after being seriously hurt in street fights or assaults has risen 50 per cent in five years.</p>
<p>More than 20 people a day were taken to hospital accident and emergency departments in England last year after being hit, kicked, scratched or bitten. Alcohol is blamed as a factor in half of the incidents and raises further questions over 24-hour drinking.</p>
<p>Researchers admit that comparisons of crime data between countries must be viewed with caution because of differing criminal justice systems and how crimes are reported and measured.</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: &#8220;These figures are misleading. Levels of police recorded crime statistics from different countries are simply not comparable since they are affected by many factors, for example the recording of violent crime in other countries may not include behaviour that we would categorise as violent crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Violent crime in England and Wales has fallen by almost a half since a peak in 1995 but we are not complacent and know there is still work to do. &#8220;<br>

		<p>Will this now end patronizing holier-than-thou British and European liberal know-it-all from lecturing the United States of America?  England is nowhere near as non-white as the United States, but already has a higher crime rate.  Imagine how bad it will be once England gets to where America is now, 1/3 non-white.</p>
<p>So much for gun control</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s true that the Labour Party opened the door to this problem, then they are culpable. However, they need to narrow down WHO is committing these crimes. Do they they want to know the answer?</p>

		<p>How can this be?  Thirty years ago, the English were renown for their politeness and honesty   &mdash;   almost to a fault!  Although there was always some crime, it was very, very low, and most of England was considered safe and peaceful.  What changed?</p>

<p>WHAT!! did they forget to include murders and rapes?? and they &#8220;forgot&#8221; to mention the involvement of aliens in these crimes and whom those crimes were AGAINST! but we all know, don&rsquo;t we. What black politician in D.C. or Balt. said that if we don&rsquo;t count the murders, our crime rate is rather low!! typical black thinking.</p>

<p>Maybe no mention of immigrants because, for the ones born in the UK and for the family line forever after, they are considered British. When the media discuss the &#8216;immigrant population&rsquo; and the &#8216;non-white population&rsquo; of the Britain, the media can be very deceptive.  </p>

		<p>ALL OBVIOUSLY DUE TO THE ALIEN INVASION.</p>
<p>In my heart, I consider the thug Blair is one of the most evil man England has ever been cursed with.  He unleased a rampage of alien invasion on England.</p>
<p>When will western nations&rsquo; people wake up and realize that alienism is a crime against humanity?  The death and destruction of a nation by allowing immigration qualifies it as a crime against humanity.</p>
<p><br>
I think the English (and others) can wake up, amend their constitution to allow national referenda, and try the alienists who destroyed their country for crimes against humanity, and deport all aliens and their children.</p>
<p>Do it before it is too late.  </p>

		<p>The UK hasn&rsquo;t a history of slavery. The blacks there migrated legally and freely due to being part of its Commonwealth. It is indeed telling that race relations are bad there, despite the fact that slavery in England was not extant as it was in America. Therefore, slavery appears NOT to be a causality factor in Blacks&rsquo; social dysfunction and retarded achievement.</p>

		<p>&gt;Overall, 5.4 million crimes were recorded in the UK in 2007 &mdash; more<br>
&gt;than 10 a minute &mdash; second only to Sweden.</p>
<p>And we all know what Sweden is known for in Europe. No, it&rsquo;s not IKEA, it&rsquo;s multiculturalism. 13.4% of the population were born out of Sweden. The UK in comparison has 9.4% of the population foreign born.</p>
<p>A thing to note is that the UK has a population of 61.6 million but Sweden only has 9.2 million yet Sweden has more crime per minute than the UK.</p>

		<p>Niu Labour have destroyed British culture after 12 years in office. The Conservatives aren&rsquo;t much better as they support more diversity and decay. The only solution for Brits is to vote BNP. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if the Home Office told the truth about the perpetrators of crime? Most of the criminals in Britian are black, muslim or gypsy. 80% of gun crime in London is black another success of multi-culturalism. Send them back to Africa so they can self destruct.</p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve heard from Brits, it could be the leniency on crime and the fact that the government doesn&rsquo;t allow law abiding citizens to defend their homes or persons with a gun or even with pepper spray, in addition to the change in immigration. Here in Texas, you can legally shoot someone who breaks into your home to rob/rape you, you can legally shoot someone who attempts to rape you etc., and sentences are often much tougher for  violent crime, including the death penalty for captial murder. This doesn&rsquo;t mean there is no crime in Texas by any matter of means,we certainly have our criminals too, many of them immigrants, but criminals are much less likely to tangle with someone who might be armed.</p>

		<p>Sorry, but someone must be using a different definition of &#8220;violent crime&#8221; for the US.  According to the numbers the article presents, one is roughly 3.5 times more likely to be a victim of &#8220;violent crime&#8221; in Austria than the USA. </p>
<p>This is ridiculous: not only have I been to both countries and can I affirm that this is not the case, a quick wikipedia search indicates that in 2002 the USA had over 7 times as many people murdered per 100,000 than Austria. (https://tinyurl.com/6x4pmk)</p>

		<p>Anonymous #3 asks:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;What changed?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The demographics of the country changed as violence-prone, low IQd Third World rabble poured in the UK.</p>
<p>Here are the crime rates by race in Britain:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the U.K. Home Office&hellip;statistics are for men in prison in relation to their numbers in the population&hellip;.the Chinese rate is 0.7 of the white rate, while the South Asian rate is 1.3 times the white rate, and the Black rate is 8.1 times the white rate&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only going to get worse due to the much higher birth rates of non-Whites in the UK:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the white fertility rate is 1.6 children per woman, while blacks and the Indians have about 30 percent more children than whites at 2.2 and 2.3. The Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Somalis have 5.0, more than three times the number of children as whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Richard Lynn estimates that, &#8220;by 2061 about two thirds of the population of Britain will be of non-European origin, while about one third will be white.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/lfejst</p>
<p>Brimelow writes that whoever allowed the demographic changes in California should be hanged from lampposts.  The same could be said of those who engineered and encouraged permanent demographic upheaval in Britain  &mdash;  at the same time demanding that the populace be unarmed and unable to defend itself. Criminals well know that the native population has been rendered defenseless through governmental policies. </p>
<p>According to Reason.com:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In the two years following the 1997 handgun ban, the use of handguns in crime rose by 40 percent, and the upward trend has continued&hellip;.  Your chances of being mugged in London are now six times greater than in New York&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only did the citizens of the UK have their guns confiscated but there is this type of insanity as well, foisted on them by traitorous bureaucrats:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;when an elderly woman fired a toy cap pistol to drive off a group of youths who were threatening her, she was arrested for putting someone in fear&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;an English homeowner, armed with a toy gun, managed to detain two burglars who had broken into his house&hellip;. When the officers arrived, they arrested the homeowner for using an imitation gun to threaten or intimidate&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2832xt" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2832xt</a></p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up, no one would believe you.</p>
<p>Hope that answers your question as to what changed.</p>

<p>Similar cases happen routinely in Italy, with people defending their homes or stores from criminals and being sent to jail.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Italy recently made illegal immigration a criminal offense, and plans to increase deportations of illegal immigrants. </p>
<p>No particular point to make, just thought I&rsquo;d throw that in.</p>

		<p>I read about this on some liberal girls blog. She was saying that multiculturalism is not the reason America is becoming a violent third-world country. And her proof of this was that the UK has the highest violent crime rates of any developed nation. Obviously, she didn&rsquo;t know that Europeans are also dealing with &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; and that the UK is becoming an Indian colony. <br>

		<p>Actually, violent crime in Britain is far lower than in the USA and far far lower than in South Africa. Comparing the statistical rates between different countries is difficult when the thing being measured in each is completely different.</p>
<p>This BNP article contains mistakes with some numbers but generally has the right idea:<br>

<p>&#8220;Actually, violent crime in Britain is far lower than in the USA &#8220;</p>
<p>Again, it depends upon where you are in either the UK or USA. When talking of people killed, the USA has a very high rate of crime and murders in gang and drug infested ethnic neighborhoods. These figures are included in the national average which gives the USA a very high rate of crime but this is very misleading. When in non-ethnic neighborhoods, the American crime rate is very low, same for the UK or Austria etc. American Whites, British Whites etc. all have equally low crime rates but the high crime rates in both of these countries comes from the ethnic groups. Some parts of the UK have much higher crime rates than the USA and the reverse is true too.</p>

		<p>Two points:</p>
<p>1) Violent crime is bad in Britain, and getting worse all the time (mainly due to the arrival of third-world, Kosovo Albanian and Roma dross), but even now it is nowhere near as bad as Texas, so simplistic solutions such as capital punishment and arming civilians clearly do not apply;</p>
<p>2) Anthony Burgess wrote the novel A Clockwork Orange in 1960 (it was published in 1962), when there were far, far fewer immigrant youths in the country. His depiction of thugs as white Anglo-Saxons had nothing to do with political correctness and everything to do with the reality of demographics at the time. (His later novel, 1985 (written in the late 1970s), had gangs of Muslim thugs roaming the streets.)</p>

		<p>There is much truth in what Johnny English says,and the true<br>
homicide rate even now remains considerably lower than that of<br>
the United States in general, and the culturally enriched South in particular.There is also the added dimension of a suicidal<br>
culture of binge-drinking among young whites.The spread of this<br>
nihilistic activity has been deliberately encouraged by the Government and its corporate cronies in the brewing trade who <br>
remain oblivious to the brutalised mayhem of English town centres<br>
that unfolds on a near-nightly basis.There is no doubt in my mind that this descent into mindless hedonism,coupled with a virtual decrimilalisation of all narcotics is part of a greater masterplan to anaesthetise what remains of the Anglo-Saxon population to a position of docility and indifference,while England mutates into Anglistan.</p>

<p>Well, Bubbah, I think you might have just a wee problem with viewing the situation with the correct analysis as to cause and effect.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;recognizing reality.&#8221;  But, don&rsquo;t feel bad, there&rsquo;s so many like you it would be possible to start your own army of dimwits the numbers is now so huge.</p>
<p>Let me give you a bit of data to consider here. First of all, you&rsquo;re not only going to fail to contain your imported restless natives, but they&rsquo;re going to get far worse from this point forward and will culminate in an out-of-control situation in a couple of years or so.</p>
<p>You will, of course, deny that and and hold to your wonderful view of a nation of smiling rainbow faces.  You&rsquo;ll do this even as you&rsquo;re carried away atop a mob of third worlders, because your&rsquo;re white, trying to get them to understand how much you love them.</p>
<p>And, it couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer guy.</p>

<p>Actually, &#8220;Johnny English&#8221;, you don&rsquo;t understand Texas or the USA when it comes to crime and most of Texas has a low crime rate. A large portion of crime here in Texas(or the USA) is caused by certain ethnic groups in ethnic neighborhoods, including large numbers of Mexican illegals coming across our border, as we border Mexico. We have higher rates of these ethnic groups than Britain, whose crime is mostly caused by certain ethnic groups also .  However, outside of these &#8220;ethnic&#8221; neighborhoods in Texas, the crime rate here  is very  low, much lower than in many British cities . This is because British cities now have large ethnic crime causing groups. My comments about guns or capital punishment are not simplistic, I&rsquo;m writing from my experience in the place where I live.   With our gun laws for law abiding citizens and concealed carry and with longer prison citizens including capital punishment, crime in Texas fell quite a bit. Home invasions in Texas are much lower than the UK because criminals are afraid of getting shot. Of course we still have plenty of crime in ethnic neighborhoods which drives up our overall averagae giving the impression that Texas is more crime ridden than the UK, but it&rsquo;s only in ethnic neighborhoods in Texas compared to White neighborhoods in Britain where this is true. . I also believe that if law abiding Brits were allowed to defend their homes and persons with gun or mace and if prison sentences became much tougher including capital punishment, crime there would fall quite a bit too. I think that law abiding people, whether in the UK or US or anywhere have a right to defent themselves against violence by any means necessary.  However, it&rsquo;s your country and if you do not wish to allow law abiding citizens guns or not have capital punishment, than that&rsquo;s you business, as it&rsquo;s your country. </p>

		<p>These statistics are bogus, contrived, and apochryphal.Austria has nearly four times as much violent crime per capita as the United States! England is more violent that South Africa! The populations of Austria and Finland are almost as violent as that of South Africa?! That&rsquo;s like claiming that Bismarck, North Dakota is almost as violent as Detroit or that Evanston has almost as many violent crimes as the Southside of Chicago.</p>

<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s not true; the crime rate amongst whites in the UK is much MUCH higher than it is here.  London has roughly three times the crime rate of New York.  London is about 8% black, NYC is 35% black.  </p>
<p>The VIOLENT crime rate is about the same for whites in both places, but keep in mind there are practically no guns in England. </p>

		<p>Hello, as a non-white living in the UK I just want to shed light on this article. The immigrant population of the UK is about 10%, much lower than the USA and even France. Next immigrants are concentrated around major metropolitan areas - London (Greater London), Birmingham (West Midlands), Manchester (Greater Manchester), Leeds &amp; Bradford (West Yorkshire), etc. But still Whites are majority in every major urban area in the UK. Next in areas that are not major urban areas whites are in complete majority. The crimes are based on the whole of the UK, so that means urban and non urban areas (in both places whites are majority), therefore it is clear that whites make up the majority of the crime statistics. If you lived in the UK like I do, then you would know that it is true.</p>

<p>The white population in the US is much larger than the black population, but it is the black population that commits 58% OF ALL VIOLENT CRIME.  They are only a little over 12% of the US population.  These statistics are going to be nearly the same in any Western nation in which blacks reside.  There&rsquo;s no denying that, and using the kind of logic you use to justify non-white criminality is absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no way you people belong in a civilized setting, and we are going into an economic phase that will bring much attention to non-white crime and violence throughout the entire West..</p>

<p>If one looks at overall crime statistices, of course Whites will be in the majority as they are the majority. However, crime statistics are broken down in the number of crimes per 100,000. Whites in the USA, for example, commit 5 murders per 100,000 on average. Hispanics commit 3-4 times that amount per 100,000. So while Whites may show having committed more murders, the murder rate when compared with Hispanics is much lower as Hispanics are a smaller portion of the populace.</p>
