<h1>China Says 140 Dead in Xinjiang Riot, Blames Separatists</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Buckley, Reuters, July 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 140 people have been killed in rioting in China&rsquo;s northwestern Xinjiang region, with the government blaming exiled separatists for the traditionally Muslim area&rsquo;s worst case of unrest in years.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people have been arrested, the official Xinhua news agency said, after protestors from the Uighur minority took to the streets of the regional capital on Sunday, burning and smashing vehicles and shops, and clashing with anti-riot police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Along with Tibet, Xinjiang is one of the most politically sensitive regions in China, and in both places the government has sought to maintain its grip by controlling religious and cultural life while promising economic growth and prosperity.</p>
<p>But minorities have long complained that Han Chinese have reaped most of the benefits from official subsidies, while making locals feel like outsiders in their own homes.</p>
<p>No figures have been given on the ethnic identity of the dead but a senior security official said that many of the bodies he saw were Han Chinese, suggesting an explosion of pent-up anger against the economically dominant group.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like a war zone here, with many bodies of ethnic Han people lying on the road,&#8221; Xinhua quoted Huang Yabo, deputy director of the Urumqi Public Security Bureau saying.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>OVERSEAS FORCES BLAMED</p>
<p>The death toll from the riot in Urumqi, 3,270 km (2,050 miles) west of Beijing, was 140 on Monday and expected to rise further, with over 800 people injured, Xinhua quoted Xinjiang police chief Liu Yaohua saying.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But exiled Uighur groups adamantly rejected the Chinese government claim of a plot. They said the riot was an outpouring of pent-up anger over government policies and Han Chinese economic dominance.</p>
<p>The riot followed a protest about government handling of a June clash between Han Chinese and Uighurs in Southern China, where two Uighurs died, after a false allegation that six Uighurs had gangraped a Han Chinese woman.</p>
<p>Almost half of Xinjiang&rsquo;s 20 million people are Uighurs, but the population of Urumqi is mostly Han Chinese.</p>
<p>&#8220;These incidents reflect the complete failure of government policies in ethnic minority areas, although there is no justification for the violence,&#8221; said Nicholas Bequelin at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally saw several Han people being stabbed. Many people on buses were scared witless,&#8221; Zhang Wanxin, a Urumqi resident, said by telephone.</p>
<p>Admissions at the People&rsquo;s Hospitals, one of the biggest in Urumqi, also suggested Han Chinese were targeted.</p>
<p>Xinhua said the hospital received 291 people of whom 17 died later. Among them 233 were Han Chinese, 39 were Uighurs, while the rest were from other ethnic minorities.</p>

		<p>To be fair to the Uighurs, this is their country. It&rsquo;s the Han Chinese who are immigrating into the Uighur homeland, oppressing and disposessing the native people, just as they did in Tibet and Taiwan. Islam is a particularly aggressive religion but it has little to do with this conflict which is overwhelmingly ethnic in character.</p>

		<p>The Chinese regime has been harsh and brutal for some 60 years, to be sure. But, aside from fighting  the United Nations in the Korean War, and giving military aid to the  North Vietnamese; they haven&rsquo;t posed the threat to us, the way Muslims have, ESPECIALLY after 9-11-01. Mao had his faults and conducted hare-brained policies at times, but I don&rsquo;t think he embarked on that Long March, just so that Chinese women would be covered in burqas. He did not promulgate the Cultural Revolution, so that one day, an Islamic caliphate would be established in China&rsquo;s western province with Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I call upon the Chinese people to defeat and destroy the Uighur Muslims, if they continue their treasonous activities. If Uighur Muslims feel the need to pray five times a day facing east, then they should be allowed to do so in the sands of Saudi Arabia. But their goals are to subjugate China and allow Muslims a firmer toehold in the world&rsquo;s most populous country. The ultimate result would be a state of dhimmitude for the mass of China&rsquo;s population. That simply cannot be allowed. </p>
<p>If Uighur Muslims want to die for their religion-which is the dream of every Muslim- then, that&rsquo;s their business. But they shouldn&rsquo;t drag the Han Chinese into their version of &#8220;Muslim heaven&#8221;. The USA should also stop supporting Uighur Muslims by refusing them entry into this country. But, with the Obama regime in Washington, that&rsquo;s dicey. He&rsquo;ll mouth some human rights platitudes for Muslims, but he won&rsquo;t send aid to the Uighur Muslims - he needs China as an &#8220;economic partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s refreshing to see Muslims being dealt with, the way they should be dealt with; for rioting, murder, pillage and destruction in a country where they make up not even 1 per cent of the total population. Undoubtedly, China has seen the destruction that Muslims have promulgated in places like India. They&rsquo;re better prepared to deal with it. Compare that to the reactions of Britain, France, Canada, Australia and even the USA, when Muslims go on a rampage.</p>
<p>Uighur Muslims should pay in blood for their actions in western China.  That way, they&rsquo;ll get to meet their god Allah, and enjoy 72 virgins in &#8220;Muslim heaven&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Muslims are having trouble?  Please.  These are terrorists, pure and simple.  It is disgusting that the US government supports them.  If the US had focused on Muslim terrorists instead of that emergency landing in Hainan, maybe September 11th would never have happened.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t seem fair for the story headline to be blaming this on the muslims. The Chinese intentionally destroy societies, like they did in Tibet, by flooding the culture with an endless supply of the Chinese minority.</p>
<p>They do it with the intent of destroying the culture. I read that in Tibet the Chinese teachers would give the children homework assignments such as &#8220;kill something and bring it to class tomorrow&#8221;. Then reward them on the kill, 1 point for an insect, 3 points for a mouse, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>They did it solely because they KNEW the Tibetian Bhuddhists believed strong it was not okay to kill things, so the Chinese worked on the children.</p>
<p>That is sick and I sympathize with the Uighur. </p>

<p>You actually have sympathy for Uighur Muslims?! Why?  They may live in a province of western China, but their allegiances are with Saudi Arabia, the motherland of Islam. They are blood brothers to the Muslims who danced in the streets after we were attacked on 9-11-01. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Let the roads of Xinjiang province flood with Uighur blood.</p>

		<p>Actually the Tocharians, a white race of Buddhists were there before the Uighurs who are muslims.  We know they were white and Buddhist because Chinese imperial records listed them as blonds and redheads who followed the teaching of Buddha.  </p>
<p>The Tocharians wiped by the muslims who came during Middle Ages when the Chinese empire was riven by rebellion.  The muslims ARE the invaders not the Chinese.  </p>
<p>The muslims are killing little Chinese girls.  This little girl and her mother were murdered by muslims.  We know this is a Chinese girl because only ethnic Han children wear the split pants.  There have been beheadings by muslims as well.</p>

		<p>In my opinion, this seems to be the fault of the Chinese. They have been the historically dominant force, and still are. But ever since the Chinese reclaimed Xinjiang as the &#8220;new territory&#8221;, they have been trying to impose their culture on them; regardless of whether the Chinese Government was Monarchy, Republic or Communist Regime. However, Tibet received better treatment under the control of the Chinese Empire, and their culture was encouraged. Maybe its time that China cut of Xinjiang and let them have their own country. This whole riot started because two Uighurs were killed in a Han Chinese City, granting independence would stop the migration, preventing another trigger. And also, the Dalai lama must be let back into Tibet, if a solution is to be achieved.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous. Tibet and Xinjiang are as much a part of China as Texas and California the United States. Tibetans and Uighurs have significantly increased in population since 1949. Their life expectancies have also been greately increased. If China really did intend to kill of Tibetans and Uighurs, and eradicate their culture, they certainly had the numbers, the power, and the ability to do it - especially during the time of Mao, when the country was virtually closed off to outsiders.</p>
<p>But instead anyone visiting those places can see thriving Tibetan and Uighur populations, speaking their own respective languages, bilingual TV stations and radio stations.</p>
<p>And they benefit from a raft of affirmative action policies, including easier access to tertiary education (in fact some Han are now even claiming Manchu ancestry to benefit from these), are not restricted to one child (as Han&rsquo;s are), and have more money spent on them per capita than Han.</p>
<p>During the Cultural Revolution the old traditions and religions of <i>all</i> people in China were targeted, not just Han.</p>
<p>The Chinese police in fact treat minorities with kid-gloves - in Shenzhen illegal Han street hawkers are come down upon like a ton of bricks, while the Uighurs hawking honeydew melons were left alone.</p>
<p>The problem is not deliberate assimilation of minorities on the part of the Han majority, it is there has not been enough assimilation, and the government by encouraging minorities to foster and maintain their traditions and language is reinforcing ethnic idendity and hence separatism. A side effect is also people who are steeped in their own traditions and can speak their own language, but are not job-ready, and competent enough to compete with Chinese Han in the job market.</p>
<p>Other examples of the wickedness of Western propaganda is reporting about the demolition of old unsafe buildings in Kashgar. The Uighurs are sometimes being forcibly evicted from old earthquake prone buildings, but are then given modern apartments. Yet this is painted as another example of Chinese perfidy - another attempt to destry the Uighur culture. Yet if China did not do this and people died in fires, or earthquakes because of unsafe buildings, the Chinese government would also be attacked by the usual suspects. And in any case, even in the West, people can be forced out of buildings deemed unsafe.<br>

<p>Ordinary Han like my brother-in-law, are actually surprised that, what they consider to be goodwill, is thrown back in their faces. He of course is oblivious to the fact that the more you try and please some people, the more they will hate you.</p>

<p>It is not the fault of the Chinese government that Han are economically dominant and it does not suggest any official policy of racism or discrimination against the Uighurs.</p>
<p>The Han Chinese are economically dominant in Malaysia, and Indonesia, and other SE Asian places where they are openly discriminated against.</p>
<p>This is a cultural thing, and admittedly Han Chinese should look at themselves and understand that the blind pursuit of wealth sometimes does alienate other people.</p>
<p>But then the Chinese authorities have every right to crack down on criminal thugs and hooligans. What Chinese authorities are doing in Xinjiang, by the way, comes nothing close in ferocity to the way the Russians dealt with Grozny. Perhaps we need a Russia approach.</p>

		<p>The difference between the majority Han and Uyghur is not only religious but racial too. Hans are pure Mongoloids while Uyghurs are Mongoloids having Caucasian (ancient Persian, Slavic and Tocharian) admixture in them. Tocharians were ancient Nordics who lived in Central Asia one of the Indo-Aryan peoples who migrated to Asia including India and Persia. Recently they have found ancient blond Caucasian mummies in these borderlands of China. Their clothing was remarkably similar to Celts like the Scots and Irish.<br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocharian_languages" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocharian_languages</a><br>
(check out the Nordic looks of the ancient Tocharians in the picture below)<br>
<a href="/wiki/File_QizilDonors.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:QizilDonors.jpg</a><br>
These Northern European like Tocharians were absorbed by Mongoloids (like the Chinese, Mongols, Turks) and they could be the ancestor populations of many Central Asian peoples who look like a combination of Caucasians and Mongoloids. Mixing with Aryan Persians and Russians later might have reinforced their Caucasian genetic heritage.<br>
One look at these Uighur girls will make you realise they are not pure Mongoloids like the Han Chinese majority. <br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBE8vbQEkGY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBE8vbQEkGY</a><br>
Their culture is closer to Central Asians like the Uzbeks, Kazaks etc&hellip; In this case I am with the muslim Uyghurs as they are just fighting from becoming a minority in their own homelands, a war Whites will have to fight in the future.<br>

		<p>  The claim that the Chinese are less racist that whites is clearly contradicted by their treatment of the racially distinct Uyghur&rsquo;s and Tibetan&rsquo;s. If there have been fewer cases of clashes with other minorities, it is only due to the fact that China has fewer minorities than either Europe or America. Many of the former mainland Chinese I&rsquo;ve known in the States are proud of their ancestry and dismissive of dark skinned minorities. China has a long history of considering outsiders as barbarians. </p>

<p>The world is NOT YOU COUNTRY. Only your country IS YOUR COUNTRY. Save some of that spirit and outrage for what is happening at home. You are not omnipotent. Only feminists, liberals and such of their ilk are omnipotent because their whole paradigm is about being blind to costs. Your culture does not extend as far as china just because we have it on the map.</p>

		<p>Dougie said it best.  If anything, the conflict here is one which Amren-ers should sympathize with, as it involves a powerful central government sponsoring mass immigration to reduce a native population to political minority status in its homeland, then blaming that population when it objects to being trampled upon.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also worth noting that the Uighurs (look them up on wikipedia) are actually substantially Caucasian.  Some have blond hair and light colored eyes.  They have an interesting and ancient history as well, so aren&rsquo;t just a group of political agitors.</p>

<p>Take notice here how even a Communist government defends their own women vehemently. Compare this to how the US or Swedish governments would respond to a rape of their own women. In such a case, they would either cover up the rape or praise the rapist.</p>

<p>Well then I suppose Amren-ers would similarly sympathize with American Indians, Australian Aborigines, and New Zealand Maoris.</p>
<p>And to avoid looking like hypocrites relinquish conquered lands and go back to Europe, as should all Eastern Slavs in the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>Tibetans are about 80 % of Tibet still, while Uighurs are 45 % of Xinjiang. Substantially more than the percentage of Indians and Aborigines in the US and Australia respectively. </p>
<p>In fact the starkest contrast in living, social, and health conditions, perhaps in any one country in the world, can be seen in Australia - Australian aborigines lag far behind Australian whites - much much more than Tibetans and Uighurs lag behind Han Chinese.<br>
 </p>
<p><i>The claim that the Chinese are less racist that whites is clearly contradicted by their treatment of the racially distinct Uyghur&rsquo;s and Tibetan&rsquo;s.</i></p>
<p>Has nothing to do with racism. Interracial conflict happens in many places - only rarely is it a result of pure racism. </p>
<p>Whether it is Chechens wanting to secede from Russia, Kashmiris from India, Tibetans from China, or Tamil Tigers from Sri Lanka, the central governments have no choice but to crack down hard.</p>
<p>But most of the time this has little to do with racism. I don&rsquo;t believe for a moment the Russians leveled Grozny because the Chechens look slightly different from them, nor China cracks down on Uighurs because they are Mongoloid-Caucasoid mixes. They crack down on them to prevent the breakup of the country along the lines of what happened in Yugoslavia, and to prevent the massive chaos and suffering that would surely accompany any such breakup.<br>

		<p>More rationalization and self-decpetion from John Liu. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t blame China because hundreds of years ago some Whites also absorbed other geographic areas&#8221;.. this piece of non-logic doesn&rsquo;t change the reality of the situation at all. The Han are now the majority in Xinjiang because of a policy designed to make this so in Beijing. This is essentially an ethnic conflict and it gives the lie to the myth that only Whites have or cause racial tensions in society. Would there be more sympathy here if the Uighurs were Christians rather them muslims? </p>

<p>Re your post (#9), I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of the Boston Tea Party. I was thinking more along the lines of the Spanish Civil War or the American Civil War. The Boston Tea Party was a revolt by colonists against a mother country. That&rsquo;s not the case here.</p>
<p>China is a sovreign nation, but the Uighur Muslims who live in Xinjiang province want their own state, their own flag, and their own sharia laws. The shots would be called from Saudi Arabia. The Uighurs will then try to impose their will upon the rest of the Chinese populace, once their &#8220;East Turkmenistan&#8221; state would be established. Think it can&rsquo;t happen? Look at the USA, with a population of over 300 million of which there are about 4-6 million Muslims. Look at all the &#8220;concessions&#8221; our leaders have made to &#8220;appease&#8221; them.</p>
<p>The Uighurs would also get support from Pakistan and Afghanistan, together a population of almost 200 million. The Chinese People&rsquo;s Republic must cut the head off this Islamic adder, before its poison can spread.</p>
<p>I reiterate, the Chinese people have not gone through what they have gone through for the past six decades in order for an Islamic caliphate to be established in western China, or for Chinese women to wear the burqa, or Chinese schoolchildren to pray five times a day facing Saudi Arabia. Nor do I think the Chinese would give up drinking alcohol or eating pork (a staple in many Chinese diets), simply because Muslims say so.</p>
<p>Let Xinjiang province flood with Uighur Muslim blood.     </p>

		<p>This is ridiculous. &hellip;anyone visiting those places can see thriving Tibetan and Uighur populations, speaking their own respective languages, bilingual TV stations and radio stations.</p>
<p>And they benefit from a raft of affirmative action policies, including easier access to tertiary education (in fact some Han are now even claiming Manchu ancestry to benefit from these), are not restricted to one child (as Han&rsquo;s are), and have more money spent on them per capita than Han.</p>
<p>The Chinese police in fact treat minorities with kid-gloves.<br>
  &mdash;   John Liu<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
I don&rsquo;t doubt any of the above.  In fact, it sounds very much like the USA, with our own demanding, insatiable  &#8220;minorities&#8221;.   The blacks especially.    Nonetheless, and despite it all, they are chronically malcontent.  No matter how much they  are given, they still want more. Demands, once satisfied, are followed by more demands.  <br>
It&rsquo;s just like here! </p>
<p>It proves that when incompatible  races mingle, no matter what concessions you grant, there will still be  suspicions of &#8220;racism&#8221;,  there will still be ethnic discord&hellip;. because ultimately it isn&rsquo;t about how much you get, it&rsquo;s about WHO you ARE.</p>
<p>This is why we believe ethnic groups should have their own countries, their own laws, their own government. And why empires ultimately fail.</p>

		<p>John Liu, no one is claiming that the Chinese authorities are cracking down on the Uyghurs because of racial differences. The point is that because of racial differences, the Uyghurs consider themselves fundamentally different from the Chinese. If you read the comments on various websites or youtube videos frequented by Uyghurs, they consider themselves part of Central Asia and not of China. <br>
  And that is the main point here. Even if a central government is biased and supportive towards a racially/culturally different minority, the minority still has feelings of resentment towards the majority. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not an anthropologist but in seeing the TV pictures from Xinjiang, it is noticeable that the Uighurs are a different raacial stock than the typical Han Chinese.<br>
 The Uighurs tend to have stronger, more prominent noses, and more facial bone definition than typical Han Chinese, who typically has flat facial features and a very small nose.<br>
  - I do get the impression that the Uighurs, though described as Turkic, do have &#8216;Caucasoid&rsquo; admixture in their blood.</p>

		<p>Uighurs are originally Turkic people, most probably an Eastern Mediterranean - Armenid blend with small Nordic impact, hence different from Mongloids like Mongols and Chinese people. They speak a Turkic language, quite understandable even for Turkish people in Anatolia.</p>
<p>The flag is the same as Turkey&rsquo;s, only the background is blue (most probably from Gokturks -means Blue Turks).</p>
<p>By the time, they absorbed a good deal of Mongloid blood and they look different now.</p>
<p>Over 45 nuclear tests in East Turkistan by the Chinese government. Over 10 million East Turkistan people including babies have been killed by the Chinese government since 1949 occupation by China. </p>

		<p><i>John Liu, no one is claiming that the Chinese authorities are cracking down on the Uyghurs because of racial differences.</i></p>
<p>I made the point in response to Sardonicus who said that the crackdown was evidence of Chinese racism. It is not.</p>
<p><i>The point is that because of racial differences, the Uyghurs consider themselves fundamentally different from the Chinese.</i></p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think so. Ethnic differences, not racial differences per se - in the way that Frenchmen would not want to be ruled by Germans perhaps.</p>
<p>One can name many conflicts between different peoples of different ethicities but of the same race.</p>
<p>But how many conflicts have been fought over racial differences per se? Not that many. In fact some of the most vicious conflicts in history have been fought between peoples of very similar racial stock.</p>
<p>There are in fact peaceful multiracial societies where people get along OK. Most conflicts in history in fact have been between peoples of the same race. Hawaii is one example. Of course not all is were there, but their problems are no more serious than those that use to affect monoracial Europe in the past, and probably a good deal less serious than the situation today between Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants, and Walloons and Flemish in Belgium, or even up until very recently French Canadians and Anglo Canadians.</p>
<p>In New Zealand whites are about 70 percent of the population. They by and large get on well with the Polynesian population (although Polynesians are overrepresented in crime and educational underachievement), with frequent intermarriage between the two groups. </p>
<p>And another surprising example - Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about Almaty? It is a huge modern city with tree-lined boulevards and excellent restaurants and cyber-cafes, situated in the green foothills beween 14,000 foot peaks and steppes like the plains of Wyoming. It is inhabited by Kazakhs and Russians living in enviable harmony (and often intermarrying), Germans, Moslems, Orthodox Christians and Orthodox Jews.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In the very end the very existence of Uighurs and Tibetans today in China - just look at them with your own eyes - most seem well fed and well clothed.</p>
<p>Just by looking at this picture (from an anti-China article), any thinking person can tell that the Uighur traditions are alive and well.<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/lrjnu9" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/lrjnu9</a></p>
<p>If the Chinese really were genocidal in intent, as they are frequently accused of being, these several million Uighurs (also Tibetans) would have simply disappeared in the 27 years between 1949 and 1976, when Mao was in power - easily - in the same way the Argentines made the Pampas Indians disappear when they opened up their interior for European colonization.</p>
<p>But instead their numbers have increased, their life-expectancy has doubled, and their language and culture are largely intact. That which has been lost, is not because of malign Chinese policies - but from modernization.</p>
<p>Truly suppressed people gnerally do not have the numbers, the means, the energy, to run amok as these Uighurs are now doing. I would also not be in the least surprised if these problems were not Western instigated.</p>

		<p>Is this conflict racial or religious? Or is it simply cultural?<br>
I think Soprano F. is making a gross over-simplication in seeing this merely as an uprising of Muslims, and calling for the province to be &#8220;flooded with their blood&#8221;!</p>
<p>I do not think it is primarily religious, nor do I think they are being directed from Saudi Arabia.  Does he hate ALL Muslims, per se? Then he hates a large part of the world&rsquo;s population!   He accuses them of being allied with S. Arabia;  the fact is that WE are the ones who are allied with S. Arabia. But whether the Uigurs were Muslims or not, they would still be different from the Han Chuinese, racially and culturally. And THAT is the issue here. They want to be left alone, and not replaced and made into a minority in their own territory. Nobody does.</p>
<p>These are a Caucasoid people who being flooded out of their ancient homeland and being displaced by a deliberate, conscious government policy of race-replacement. This is EXACTLY the same situation that is going on in Britain and elsewhere today, where the same government race-replacement policies are in effect.  These people are showing a lot more spunk and resistance than the docile, dispirited  Europeans are. Yes, they HAPPEN to be Muslim, as a historical accident, but this is NOT about Islam.  They are an ancient people trying to hold onto their land and culture. And he calls for their blood! </p>
<p>If the British, Dutch, Italians, or Swedes were to rise against their race-replacing governments, would he also be calling for their blood to flow in the streets?  That would be the equivalent.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to second #16&rsquo;s comment that &#8220;THIS IS NOT OUR PROBLEM&#8221; and I think/hope that even our pharaoh obamses will stay out of China&rsquo;s internal problems. China is consolidating demographic dominance of Xinjiang and is going onto establish significant economic ties with &#8220;The Stans&#8221; in central Asia. This will inevitably bring Russia into conflict with China. Russia is losing one million people a year to death and emigration. It would seem that in the long term we should be helping Russia save herself if only to help the last remaining majority white country in the world.  </p>

		<p>The Uighurs are not the native people of the region.  They&rsquo;re muslims who invaded the region from Mongolia in the Middle Ages.  The Uighurs were the ones who killed off and bred out the original white Tocharians.  The original population was Buddhist and the Uighurs turned the region Islamic.  </p>
<p>For a thousand years, these Tocharians had thrived in the region under Chinese control from Han to Tang.  When the Uighurs came, the Tocharians disappeared from history.</p>
<p>And ask the Russians how they feel about Turks or Turkmen.  Using the Tocharians as an excuse to side with the Uighurs like telling a murderer that he can have the victim&rsquo;s property because he was the last one in the house when owner was killed.</p>
<p>If there are any actual Tocharians around, they would be horrified.  These muslims were the very ones who killed them off.  </p>

<p>You may know this and you may not, but Han Chinese are some 90% of the ethnic makeup of the Chinese People&rsquo;s Republic. If they are being relocated by the Chinese government to Xinjiang province, then so be it. The point is, native Chinese are relocating to an are that heretofore had been mainly populated by non-Han Chinese. This is far different from European nations importing Bantus or Arabs into their countries. It&rsquo;s not like the Chinese government is importing Bengalis, Koreans or Pakistanis into Xinjiang province. so your suggesting I think native Europeans should shed blood is inane.</p>
<p>I note the Uighur Muslims looted, burned automobiles, set fires and attacked Han Chinese. Just like Muslims in France, Australia and Britain have done. Only this time, the  Uighur Muslims in China aren&rsquo;t being confronted by impotent British bobbies or French gendarmes. They&rsquo;re having their heads pounded by the Chinese police and troops, in response to their criminal actions. They deserve exactly what they&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>Because the Uighurs are Muslims, they are guided 100% in everything they do and say by their religion. I still contend that they want their own state, bordering some 200 million other Muslims in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. Eventually, their goal may be to turn all of China into an Islamic state.</p>
<p>Look at what happened in India. The Muslims agitated and agitated for their own state, so that India was carved up into West Pakistan, East Pakistan and India, by Mountbatten, and with the connivance of Mahatma Gandhi. This so angered Nathuram Godse, of the Hindu Mahabsaba, that he resolved to liquidate Gandhi for costing India 1/3 of her territory.</p>
<p>The Chinese are well aware of what happened to the old Soviet Union - and they&rsquo;ll be darned if they will go through the same thing. Uighur Muslims may be a Caucasoid ethnic people, but, their religion trumps everthing else.   </p>
