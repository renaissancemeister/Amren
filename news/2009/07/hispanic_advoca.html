<h1>Hispanic Advocates in Chicago for Convention</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sophia Tareen, AP, July 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The head of one of the largest Hispanic advocacy groups in the country said Monday that she fears hate rhetoric directed toward Hispanics and immigrants is on the rise partly in response to the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor.</p>
<p>Janet Murguia, CEO and president of the National Council of La Raza, told The Associated Press that comments that she considers derisive from anti-immigrant rights groups and right-wing pundits might be gaining traction.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She pointed specifically to talk show hosts Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage and groups such as the Minutemen, which calls for tighter restrictions on the nation&rsquo;s borders. A handful of members from the Minutemen&rsquo;s Illinois affiliate protested La Raza&rsquo;s four-day conference.</p>
<p>Murguia said Sotomayor  &mdash;  who has been a member of La Raza  &mdash;  was unfairly labeled a racist and that the dialogue around her confirmation hearings has been hateful.</p>
<p>Murguia also contends the lack of a comprehensive immigration reform bill this year is contributing to the harsh rhetoric. But she remained optimistic that a bill could be signed by next year.</p>
<p>La Raza, named for a Spanish term meaning &#8220;the people,&#8221; held large voter registration drives for the 2008 presidential election. A former leader of the group was recruited by the White House to become its director of intergovernmental affairs.</p>

		<p>Joe:</p>
<p>Groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center, and increasingly The Race (La Raza) itself like to genuflect around the definition of &#8220;raza,&#8221; esp. in light of La Raza&rsquo;s motto, which translates to &#8220;for those of the race, everything, for those outside the race, nothing.&#8221;  They like to say that right wing bigots only claim that &#8220;raza&#8221; means &#8220;race&#8221; when it really means &#8220;people.&#8221;  </p>
<p>As if that&rsquo;s so damned different.</p>
<p>Right-wing extremist sources like the Oxford University Spanish Dictionary and Google Translate define &#8220;raza&#8221; as &#8220;race.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I just used Google Language Tools and &#8220;raza&#8221; translated as &#8220;race&#8221;. Of course, that should be obvious just by looking at the word. Can you believe that corporations and government are giving millions of dollars to a militant organization calling itself &#8220;the race&#8221;? I wonder if this is why the SPLC is going to Arizona - to fight the racial supremacist &#8220;La Raza&#8221;? hahahahahah</p>

		<p>Perhaps, since this country is is so rife with bigotry and &#8220;hate speech&#8221;, hispanics might be happier living someplace else. Mexico springs to mind; I bet that there is very little anti-hispanic sentiment in Mexico. Please don&rsquo;t misunderstand my motives for this suggestion. I suggest this only because I hate to see hispanics so unhappy and oppressed.</p>
<p>BTW I wonder who this reporter thinks she&rsquo;s fooling with her laughable La Raza= the people statement.  </p>

		<p>La Raza takes its name from DÃ­a de la Raza, the &#8220;Day of the Race&#8221;, which is celebrated in Mexico and the Hispanic Americas. It is a rallying point for anti-white activists.</p>
<p>It also refernces the historic phrase, &#8216;Mejorar la Raza&rsquo;, which means &#8220;improve the race&#8221; by intermarriage with whites or people of lighter skin.  In the heirachy of Latin America and the Caribbean, the lighter-skinned mulattos were considered to be of higher status than those closer to black.  For the most part, Latin America is a mulatto race stratified by color.</p>
<p>This love and hate of whites by non-white Latin America can only be reconciled by a firm separation of the two races by a physical wall, or a melting pot where whites will be swallowed into the mulatto stew.   <br>

The women are full of hatred towards me. I was a long time figuring out it was my skin/hair color! Speech can be hurtful only if you allow it.

<p>Wait a minute! Sonia Sotomayor still IS a member of that organisation. And not just any member: she&rsquo;s one of their executives, on their National Council of La Raza.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind precisely who we are dealing with. I mean, an angry ingrate who owes everything to Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>And I agree: Raza means race, period. It&rsquo;s not a matter of context, or whatever&hellip; The Spanish language has other, clearly defined words, for a concept such as Â«peopleÂ».</p>
<p>Man! Will anybody dare confront her directly on the REAL issues?</p>

		<p>No dear, the disgust intelligent legal citizens Americans have towards illegal aliens and affirmative action existed before we heard of Judge Sonia. </p>
<p>We consider illegal aliens enemies of our country. Affirmative Action has been an unconstitutional abomination since 1966. That EEOC, White Houses, Big Businesses and Academia love discrimination against Whites  is a constant irritant that has been felt long before your meaningless convention recently.</p>
<p>Eventually we will get rid of Affirmative Action, illegal aliens, and their illegal brat anchor offspring. We are not giving up. This fight may take decades. We will never accept the Latinization and Africanization of America. America is a European nation, Anglo Saxon in culture. Hit the Road Jack.</p>

		<p>Jared and everyone else here should bookmark in their brain-and on paper-as many examples as possible of hispanic,black and asian expressions of racial solidarity in the political arena.</p>
<p>Of course, Native Born White Americans will be called racists for doing the same thing. But it is now time to take a stand against OUR race-replacement at the hands of post-1965 asians,blacks,hispanics and muslims. Because if WE don&rsquo;t, WE will face experience race-replacement and become an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America.</p>
<p>Expressions of hispanic racial solidarty is tolerated and encouraged by leftists-Alexander Cockburn-liberals and worshipers of the corporation. This fact should be pointed out in every debate that Jared Taylor participates in. Always point out he double standard and do not accept it.</p>
<p>Barack Obama did not make any new inroads into the Native Born White population. There are millions of Native Born White Americans who see him for what he is:an anti-white Kenyan bigot. I for one do not recognize him as an American. </p>
<p>When things get bad enough, there will be a full-blown Native Born White American revolt. But when this happens, there will be a of American territory. When this point  in time arrives Native Born White Amerians are going to have to ask themselves what are the consequences of not throwing the asians,hispanics and muslims out of California,Texas and Arizona.</p>

<p>And do those LEGAL &#8220;American&#8221; citizens include the millions of high fertility post-1965 chinese,koreans,hindus,sihks,pakistanis,hmong,liberians,ghanians and nigerians who are actively participating in reducing Native Born White Ameriacans to an ever dwindling racial minorioty withnt the borders of America? Who do you think imposed the anti-white Kenyan bigot Barack Obama on Native Born White Americans? </p>
<p>You are spending way too much time watching Lou Dobbs the pro-post 1965 high fertility  non-white LEGAL immigrant enhusiast. You know who Lou Dobbs is right? The multimillionaire White guy who threw his White wife overboard for a young hot Latina.</p>

		<p>I wonder who is funding this convention.  I assume it is the Restaurant and Hotel associations, construction companies, farmers, security guard companies the National Association of Manufactures and the American Chamber of Commerce and all the other employers who want an endless supply of below minimum wage non english speaking illegal immigrant slave labor.</p>
<p>Karl Marx, David Ricardo, Milton Freidman and every other economist were right when they said that the bigger the supply of a commodity, the less each individual unit of that commodity would cost.</p>
