<h1><a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2009/07/200972715185232635.html">Liberia&rsquo;s Taylor Denies Cannibalism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Al-Jazeera English, July 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Liberia&rsquo;s former president has described claims that he ate human flesh as &#8220;sickening&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some witnesses had claimed at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, where Charles Taylor is facing war crimes charges, that combatants from his National Patriotic Front of Liberia had eaten people to instill fear in civilians in the West African nation.</p>
<p>One witness had testified he ate human flesh with Taylor at a gathering of a secret society called Poro.</p>
<p>Taylor denied the allegations on Monday, saying: &#8220;It never happened. I never ordered any combatant to eat anyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is sickening. You must be sick to believe it,&#8221; he told the court, which is sitting in The Hague in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes you feel like throwing up,&#8221; he said, as he began his third week of giving evidence.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Total nonsense&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Taylor acknowledged that there were cannibals in certain parts of Liberia, but claims that he was among them were &#8220;total nonsense&#8221;.</p>
<p>Taylor has been on trial since January 2008 on 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the brutal 1991-2001 civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>He is accused of arming the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone in exchange for so-called &#8220;blood diamonds&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is beyond imagination that one could believe that the president of Liberia would go into Sierra Leone because he wants to terrorise the population and go for its wealth,&#8221; Taylor said on Monday.</p>
<p>He rejected witness statements that vehicles laden with weapons were sent across the border from Liberia, saying that the roads that linked the two West African nations were virtually impassable.</p>
<p>&#8220;No road existed then and no road exists now,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p>Liberia is the country where Abraham Lincoln sent the black slaves in his &#8220;Back to Africa&#8221; plan. The ex-slaves were accompanied by about 7 white people, mainly ministers and their wives.</p>
<p>Within three weeks of landing in Liberia, the blacks went mad and no trace has ever been found of the white people who accompanied them. It was always suspected that the blacks ate the whites, so these allegations of cannibalism are not entirely unfounded.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Liberia&rsquo;s Taylor Denies Cannibalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who but blacks have to defend themselves with the assertion that, &#8220;That&rsquo;s not true, I never ate anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can just see the headlines in the black newspapers here in the states where he&rsquo;s from shouting, &#8220;Taylor never ate anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>You know what this is?  This is a typical black criminal who is on our streets right now numbering in the millions.</p>
<p>Killing, beating, fighting, mugging, robbing, selling dope, all describe a large portion of blacks in the West.  When they go to Africa they let it all hang out.</p>

		<p>WOW! I did not know that about the 7 Whites that accompanied the blacks sent to Liberia. They sure did not know the true nature of blacks did they?  Why are Whites like this so naive and altruistic with the NONwhites of the world? Don&rsquo;t they ever learn?</p>

		<p>I mean, sure, there&rsquo;s some cannibalism in Liberia, but to accuse the president of Liberia of cannibalism? Well, that&rsquo;s just preposterous. (And racist of course)</p>

		<p>If you really want to get a &#8220;flavor&#8221; for the Liberian Civil War, google Joshua Blahyi. At least it has a happy ending of sorts.</p>

		<p>The closest I can think of is when Stalin made his first speech after being invaded, one of the insults he hurled at him was cannible. This was a generic russian insult. Sort of if I call you an SOB, I do not mean you are an ouspring of a female dog.</p>

		<p>Google Liberia and Charles Taylor and you will learn that he supported at times by the US and the CIA, murdered hundreds of thousands of people. The murders were done in ways that make cannibalism seem humane. </p>
<p>Please read The Darling by Russell Banks, one of America&rsquo;s most honored and most talented novelists. His novel is a thinly disguised tale of an American woman who marries a black official of Taylor&rsquo;s regime, and how she turns from a well meaning liberal to a realistic white woman who has faced the most barbaric regime on the face of the Earth.</p>
<p><br>
Taylor never admitted to garden variety torture, so his denial of eating human flesh is as ingenuous.  Now we are admitting many Liberians to America as refugees.  </p>
<p>Liberia: a Place of Horror that Joseph Conrad would have understood.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Taylor acknowledged that there were cannibals in certain parts of Liberia&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>For decades white people like Senator Ernest Hollings who joked about African cannibals were called ignorant racists and lectured by the p.c. media that this practice no longer existed in the Dark Continent.</p>
<p>Yet more media disinformation.  </p>

		<p>Liberia? You, forgot the Congo, Zimbabwe, Kenya, South Africa, Somalia, etc, and every other nation in Africa. Cannibalism is not only a Liberian problem but a wider range among Blacks in general. Look what they did to &#8220;Channon Christine and Chris Newsom&#8221; here in America. Then there is cases recently of a Mexican killing her baby and and eating it as well. This is non-whites at their best and that is the saddest thing, wait to you see their worst.</p>

		<p>Response to 9.:</p>
<p>Cannibalism is not a problem at all, until its practiced by blacks on blacks in Afrika. It is their culture, their habits, they should keep it if they want. </p>
<p>Whites should not even try to teach or pamper africans we have seen where it goes. If they want to eat themselves up, I have no problem with it.</p>
<p>Cannibalism only gets to a problem, if its practiced on whites. </p>
