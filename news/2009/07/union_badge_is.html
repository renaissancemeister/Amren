			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Express (London), July 29,2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SCOTLAND Yard officers have been banned from wearing Union Flag badges in support of troops because they are deemed &#8220;offensive&#8221;.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police chiefs ordered that the tiny emblems, which cost £1 with proceeds going to charity, must be removed after a complaint.</p>
<p>But 70 officers are continuing to wear them in defiance of the latest row over political correctness.</p>
<p>Peter Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, called the decision &#8220;shameful&#8221;.</p>
<p>The row started when 200 officers at Heathrow Airport were barred from wearing the badges, which raise funds for the British Legion and Help for Heroes.</p>
<p>A petition against the ban has been launched on the Downing Street website. Last night a Met spokesman said: &#8220;Only approved corporate badging may be used.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>What errant nonsense. Notice the article doesn&rsquo;t even mention WHY the Union Badge is &#8216;offensive&rsquo;. It assumes we know that any aspect of white civilization is automatically evil by PC standards. So forget about all that liberal talk about respecting everyone&rsquo;s heritage. If you&rsquo;re white it doesn&rsquo;t apply to you. It&rsquo;s heartening to hear that 70 brave souls have defied the Establishment. We have patriots everywhere who will resist. </p>

		<p>The cops should have instead brandished the flags of Jamaica, Pakistan,  India and Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>Had they done that it would have been the first time the British Left complimented the police.</p>

		<p>It is quite a commentary on our times when displaying your country&rsquo;s flag -in your own country- is banned for being &#8220;offensive&#8221;. </p>
<p>I fear the new standard western nations will unite under will be the white flag of surrender. </p>

		<p>The bizzarre situation in the UK now is that any immigrant can say that the British flag is &#8220;offensive&#8221; and a policeman will visit the owner and require them to take it down. This has happened so often that it is no longer news.</p>
<p>If, however a British person objected to, say, an Islamic flag flying outside a mosque he would be called a racist, hate-monger and probably arrested and charged. The flag would not be taken down.</p>
<p>British police are now issued with headcovers to wear when entering a mosque - out of respect. </p>
<p>If YOU entered a mosque and refused to wear your clothing in an approved way and didn&rsquo;t remove your shoes YOU would be accused of insentivity/bigotry.</p>
<p>Recently a group of children (accompanied by a muslim teacher in Islamic attire) visited a Catholic School. Upon entering the school staff requested the muslim to remove her headwear as a sign of respect for the schools rules. She refused and eventually was asked to leave.</p>
<p>Lack of respect? Bigotry?</p>
<p>Yes - but this time the SCHOOL was accused of that. Not the Muslim.</p>
<p>See a pattern here guys?<br/>

		<p>Let me get this straight, the government of a nation prohibits the people of that nation to display their own flag? Are you convinced you are ruled by traitors who hate you yet? </p>

<p>Absolutely correct! Why should Whites be ashamed to acknowledge, and take pride in their in a flag, which is a symbol of their country and their heritage? But wait! That&rsquo;s exactly why these ethnic immigrants find it so offensive, because it reminds them that they are not indigenous people of the country. These non-white ingrates move to country which generously takes them in as asylum seekers, and make all sorts of demands, but have the nerve to complain about the symbol of their adopted homeland. If they have a problem with it, then let them go back to the countries they claim persecuted them so badly.</p>

		<p>The Union badge is offensive and forbidden, but the Police have been ordered to stand down on muslim hate crimes.<br/>
From the Daily Express.</p>
<p>UK NEWSTAKE IT EASY ON MUSLIM EXTREMISTS, POLICE TOLD </p>
<p>Police will be urged to turn a blind eye to provocative acts by Muslim protest groups <br/>
Saturday July 11,2009 <br/>
By Macer Hall POLICE will be ordered not to charge Muslim extremists in many hate crime cases – to stop them becoming more militant.</p>
<p><br/>
Guidelines will tell forces to press for conviction only in cases of clear-cut criminal acts.</p>
<p>Officers will be advised not to proceed when evidence of lawbreaking is &ldquo;borderline&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Examples of crimes to which a blind eye may be turned include incitement to religious hatred or viewing extremist material on the internet.</p>
<p>Last night critics warned that the move could mean Islamic radicals being give the freedom to encourage violence.</p>
<p>Some saw the move as a politically correct attempt to appease extremists who hate Britain.</p>
<p>It could even mean officers tolerating many activities of Muslim preachers of hate like the hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza.</p>
<p>Tory MP David Davies said: &ldquo;This sounds like abject surrender. Everyone should be equal in the eyes of the law. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether someone is suspected of incitement to hatred or shoplifting – they should all face the same risk of prosecution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be no special favours or treatment for any section of the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officials insist there is no suggestion that people who have clearly committed offences will avoid prosecution.</p>
<p>Instead, they want to avoid alienating Muslims on the fringes of extremism by dragging them to court over petty allegations unlikely to result in conviction.</p>
<p>One fear is that some young Muslims are falling under the influence of extremist preachers while serving prison sentences or on remand awaiting trial.    </p>
<p>A senior Whitehall official said the guidance was being drawn up as part of a drive to use persuasion rather than the criminal justice system to fight extremism. </p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;The aim is to stop people being dragged into extremism. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not talking about letting someone off who has committed a clear offence, but where it is unclear if an offence has been committed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance, where there has been incitement or someone has been on the internet there can be a grey area where there is some discretion and it would be more sensible to avoid going down the criminal route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Government&rsquo;s counter- terrorism board is drawing up the advice, which will be sent to all police forces, including the Metropolitan, later this year. </p>
<p>The move follows an updated Home Office counter-terrorism strategy announced earlier this year. The new strategy urges preventative measures to win round potential extremists instead of arrest and prosecution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to be able to provide support for individuals who are drawn into criminal activity,&rdquo; the document says.</p>
<p>Councils, community groups and the Government&rsquo;s youth justice board will be among organisations expected to identify those drawn into extremism or at risk. </p>
<p>Social workers, teachers and other professionals will be asked to try to work with some Muslim youths to reduce the likelihood of them turning into extremists.</p>
<p>But the new strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of prosecutions against Islamist extremists protesting against troops.</p>
<p>In Luton earlier this year, protesters displayed placards bearing the words &ldquo;butchers&rdquo; and &ldquo;animals&rdquo; at a homecoming parade for 2nd Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment. There were no arrests for incitement. </p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said: &ldquo;Preventing people becoming radicalised is a key priority for the Government. The police response needs to be proportionate to deal with crimes people commit while reducing the risk to public safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latest move represents a reversal of the policy introduced under Tony Blair in the wake of the terrorist attacks in London in 2005, when as Prime Minister he called for an overhaul of the criminal justice system to root out and prosecute extremists.</p>
<p>Past attempts to win over potential Muslim radicals have frequently run into controversy. Millions of pounds have been pledged to fund Muslim groups, drawing claims that they are receiving special treatment.<br/>

		<p>BUT, police officers are allowed,(probably encouraged or even ordered) to wear badges in support of &#8220;Gay Pride&#8221;. British values and morals have been completely turned on their head.  Someone commented a couple of days ago about seeing people (of all races) at a supermarket in the USA looking like a bunch of vagrants, with sloppy clothes, and sloppy attitudes.  Its like that here in the UK.  Slobby people, slobby attitudes,slobby ways of dressing,  young girls and middle aged women with tattoos on their forearms, necks and cleavages.  Here is a story from my local paper, about one of those slobby people. It&rsquo;ll make you see red. This &#8220;woman&#8221; would fit right in the ghetto of one of Americas cities, yet she is White, and lives in a small seaside town in England.  When did we become like this, and how?  </p>
