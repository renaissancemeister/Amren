<h1>LDS Missionaries: Undocumented Immigrants Walk Fine Line When Spreading Their Faith</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peggy Fletcher Stack, Salt Lake Tribune, July 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since April, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has scrambled to adjust its transportation procedures for undocumented missionaries after Jose Calzadillas was detained by Customs and Border Control agents at the Cincinnati airport for not having proper identification. He was flying home after a successful Mormon mission in Ohio.</p>
<p>To avoid such problems, the church has assigned undocumented prospective missionaries (who must declare their immigration status before serving) only to U.S. missions. Those missionaries likely will have to stay out of airports and arrive and leave by car, bus or train.</p>
<p>The arrest has had a &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; on Mormonism&rsquo;s Latino wards and branches, says a Chilean immigrant and returned LDS missionary named Jaime, who declined to give his last name because of his immigration status.</p>
<p>Other than for its missionaries, the LDS Church takes a &#8220;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&#8221; approach toward the immigration status of its members. But some estimate between 50 percent and 75 percent of members in Utah&rsquo;s 104 Spanish-speaking congregations are undocumented. That includes many bishops, branch presidents, even stake presidents.</p>
<p>Despite LDS leaders&rsquo; call for compassion in the formation of immigration laws, mostly Mormon lawmakers passed SB81, which took effect July 1 and tightens enforcement while limiting access to some services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lord&rsquo;s errand</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a balancing act for LDS authorities, given that many of the main opponents of undocumented immigrants also happen to be Mormon.</p>
<p>From that perspective, undocumented immigrants are violating church principles, especially the 12th Article of Faith, which says members believe in &#8220;obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&rsquo;re undocumented, they are not legal,&#8221; says state Sen. Scott Jenkins, R-Plain City, a former LDS missionary. &#8220;If they are working, they are using another person&rsquo;s Social Security number. It is wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenkins says he has compassion for undocumented immigrants. &#8220;We should feed, clothe and help them, but does that mean I should help them commit a felony?&#8221;</p>
<p>As to sending undocumented missionaries, the church &#8220;has been warned,&#8221; Jenkins says. &#8220;The day the government starts cracking down on this, the church could be in a tough situation.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Gospel cause</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not agents of the immigration service, and we don&rsquo;t pretend to be,&#8221; apostle Jeffrey R. Holland told The Salt Lake Tribune recently, &#8220;and we also won&rsquo;t break the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end, the church sends missionaries among undocumented immigrants, baptizing many of them without ever asking about their status. It also allows them to go to the temple and on missions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The LDS Church also is deeply involved in helping Spanish-speaking members integrate into U.S. society.</p>
<p>As part of the church&rsquo;s Inner City Project here, Rock Balstaed oversees about 70 couples who volunteer in Spanish-speaking congregations. They provide English classes and job training, as well as assess and assist with medical and dental needs.</p>
<p>Some LDS attorneys with the J. Reuben Clark Law Society also provide legal assistance when immigrants have disputes with neighbors of employers.</p>

		<p>Dirty little secrets like this are why Whites must not look to the LDS church to be the saviors of the White American population. They are not pro-white  &mdash;  they are pro-Mormon; since the Mormon church now does their heaviest recruiting in South America and Southeast Asia, this church will just get darker and darker. And those new Mormons will flock to America, screaming for asylum.</p>

		<p>I am not LDS, but I moved to SLC two years ago and I&rsquo;m deeply disappointed in the official LDS stance on illegal immigration. The church leadership is WAY out of sink with its members on this issue (as evidenced by SB81).  Salt Lake is experiencing a growing problem with Hispanic gang crime.  It&rsquo;s sad that the church is willing to let this fine city&rsquo;s neighborhoods suffer. Mormons here are fed up with it.</p>

		<p>All of these organized churches are working against immigration law, and make it so much harder, for Americans to straigten out their nation. I am catholic myself, but will not support the church in any way where illegal immigration into my nation is concerned. Too many laws are already being made null by too many Americans, and the effects are horribly corrosive to the U.S.</p>

		<p>Until a convenient &#8216;revelation&rsquo; in 1978 (I believe), the LDS actually debarred non-Whites from their flock.<br>
 Joseph Smith and Brigham Young weren&rsquo;t actually tos sensitive with the political correctness.</p>

		<p>The majority of &#8220;Christian&#8221; churches today are a shell of their former selves. They have sold us out just as much as our government has. I cannot think of even one church that doesn&rsquo;t promote nonwhite causes and 3rd world immigration to the detriment of America and especially to White Americans. Yet, it is these same Whites they come to when they want the almighty $$$ and to peddle 3rd world adoptions and to feed Africa. Like many say, we are genociding ourselves.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think Joseph Smith and Brigham Young would have approved the latinization of the LDS.  </p>
<p>Their great accomplishment was to create a true American born Church. And they did it. And the accomplishments of Mormons in business and agriculuture despite a harsh climate and discrimination from other Christians are to be applauded. </p>
<p>This outreach to nonwhites will kill this admirable Church. I am not a Mormon.</p>

		<p>Over the years and since childhood I have known many Mormons.  They are great family people, but I also have noticed that anything that makes money for them, individually or organization-wise is somehow part and parcel of the basic principal of Mormonism.  From what I have gathered from 19th century history, it appears to be from the early period when they were struggling for survival and getting back at other non-Mormon pioneers who passed through the territories they dominated - a helping hand always came with a price - a high one.  And then there is the infamous Mountain Meadow Massacre that they don&rsquo;t like anyone to bring up.</p>
<p>Also, this is more evidence of the proof regarding my own continual &#8220;screed&#8221; about the inborn faults in Christianity.  It prescribes the inclusion of non-Whites - it seeks to convert the world.  No where in the NT is there a mention of it being the faith of White Europeans.  It crept into Europe or was forced in - read up on it, my friends!  Now, it just wants to grow itself as was always intended.  That this seems to shock and surprise some conservative Christians in America only demonstrates the tragic misinterpretation that time and historic/cultural illiteracy has created in the White population.</p>

		<p>I live in Utah and all the Mexicans here are Mormons.  The missionaries promise them a green card if they join.  Their families in Mexico are still Catholics.  The church of LDS will be getting 10% from these converts as well as the future generations.  As in most every aspect of Americn life, it&rsquo;s all about the Benjamins.</p>
