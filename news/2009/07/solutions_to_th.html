			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner, July 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There are a few, painfully simple measures we could take to stop the current invasion and expel those who have no respect for our borders, nor for our citizens. Truthfully, if any combination or even one of the following actions were taken by our federal government, most illegal aliens in this country would leave, effectively deporting themselves.</p>
<p>1) Place the military on the border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We could simply take the troops from Germany, where 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed or any number of other locations around the world and use our military to protect our border!</p>
<p>The Mexican border could and should be made a permanent duty station. This would allow the Border Patrol to full staff the official entry checkpoints which would greatly reduce the amount of drugs and criminals coming into this country.</p>
<p>2) Prison sentences for CEO&rsquo;s who hire illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Whether it is a landscaping company run-out of someone&rsquo;s den in Cicero, IL; a 30-unit independent hotel in Virginia Beach, VA; or a corporate giant such as Tyson Foods Inc., once caught with illegal aliens in their employ, the head of that company should spend the next ten years of their life in prison.</p>
<p>Additionally, a percentage of that company&rsquo;s profits commensurate to the percentage of their employees who are illegal aliens should be seized.</p>
<p>3) Cut off all federal funds to cities which continue or adopt &#8216;sanctuary policies&rsquo; for illegal aliens.</p>
<p>If a city such as Chicago, IL which has such a policy in place, refuses to cooperate with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement by not allowing police officers to inquire into, nor report the immigration status of arrestees, shielding criminal aliens from notification and eventual deportation, their funds will be immediately suspended. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>4) Require anyone registering a child in a public school to provide proof of U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If parents were required to provide proof of citizenship to register the child, many illegal aliens would simply leave the country. You take away the things that draw them here and most will deport themselves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>5) Begin mass deportations.</p>
<p>Again, if you take away the goodies (jobs, free education, in-state college tuition, food stamps, Medicaid, etc.), most will return to Mexico on their own. However, there will remain a number of Mexican nationals who will refuse to leave, a great many of them will be hardcore criminals (gang bangers, drug dealers, etc.). These human predators will only return home, if forcibly removed.</p>
<p>We have heard so many times that it is &#8220;impossible to deport 12 million people.&#8221; First, the number of illegal aliens in this country is closer to 40 million, second, nothing is impossible.</p>
<p>As I said, most will leave after they are denied the services which they now steal with ease. The rest would be deported upon arrest for other crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We have the infrastructure, resources, and the right to deport as many illegal aliens from this nation as we want. The only thing we are lacking is a federal government with the courage to do it. We must change that and take back this great country.</p>
<p>If we do not, future generations of Americans will reside in a Third World nation, and it will be a mirror image of Mexico.<br>

		<p>As for the first measure,(troops on the border) when Jorge Bush was our president we did this and i&rsquo;m sure it reduced illegal crossings, but i doubt that it caused many aliens already here to return home. Number two&rsquo;s a great idea, wouldn&rsquo;t we all love to see the greedy employers of illegal aliens put in orange jump suits and thrown in jail?! As for number three, many of the republicans who sought their party&rsquo;s nomination supported that proposal(like Romney &amp; Tancredo) but the actual candidate, the clueless &#8216;Juan&rsquo; McCain who is about as suicidal on immigration as they come didn&rsquo;t. Number four is an excellent idea and would greatly discourage illegal aliens and thier families form trying to settle in the US. Just one problem though. The Supreme Court in a norrow 5-4 ruling back in the 1980s stuck down a Texas law barring illegal aliens from public schools. Californians tryed to reverse this decison by passing proposition 187 in 1994 which would have kept illegals out of the schools. But before the Supremes had a chance to revisit the issue, ex Calif. governor Davis had the measure killed with the help of the reconquistas. Now the state is near the bottom in academic acheivemnet when it was once on the top and the offspring of illegal aliens are no doubt to blame for this. Plus, the state is on the brink of bankrupcy because of the BILLIONS it spends annually to teach these illgal aliens pupils. As for number five, i&rsquo;m afraid it could cause real trouble -even riots- from the illegal themselves so i wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it on a mass scale. </p>

		<p>Millions of school children are bused daily to and from school in this country. During the summer break, employ bus drivers for &#8220;shovel ready jobs&#8221;, driving the thousands of idle school buses, across the border depositing people back to their home country. For those that don&rsquo;t want to ride the bus, have Amtrac set up daily train runs. You can move large numbers of people.</p>

		<p>Do (2) and no public assistance for illegals, and you really won&rsquo;t need to do much of anything else.  Most will self-deport, and many that were thinking about coming won&rsquo;t.  Not that I&rsquo;m opposed to doing the other things.</p>
<p>During the 1950s Dwight Eisenhower-endorsed &#8220;Operation Wetb**k,&#8221; most illegals self-deported because that which was there for them was taken away, and a small fraction were deported physically to send the message that the Federal government would do it.</p>

<p>7) Cut off all Social Services and various &#8220;Benefts&#8221; to ALL Illegals.</p>
<p>8) Outlaw &#8220;Sanctuary City&#8221; and similar policies which clearly undermine Federal law.  </p>

		<p>Well, whether or not they will self-deport I don&rsquo;t know.  But one thing I DO KNOW is that there won&rsquo;t be too many of them who will have jobs from this point forward.</p>
<p>This economy is doing nothing but spiraling seriously downward.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t work, and social benefits are out of the question, the only thing they can do if they stay is to steasl or sell dope.</p>
<p>But, on second thought, that&rsquo;s what a lot of them are doing right now.</p>

		<p>Inventing ways to rid the country of illegal aliens is easy. Persuading our ruling class not to replace us with third world people is hard. Other than violent revolution, I can&rsquo;t think of any way to do it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The only thing we are lacking is a federal government with the courage to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good proposals, but all 5 have been strongly recommended by the citizens again and again. Year after year. So yes, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that the federal government is the problem, but I disagree that a lack of courage has anything to do with their inaction.  The answer seems to be that regardless of what the People want, all of these proposals are simply contrary to what our politicians want.</p>
<p>In support of that thought, consider how many in congress or the WH have promised to answer the People&rsquo;s grievances with one or more of these solutions.  Compare that number with the number who have actually introduced any legislation to back up those promises.  Where&rsquo;s the tough enforcement the executive branch has been promising for over twenty years? Words. Just words.</p>
<p>If they were employees, it would be simple. Fire &#8216;em on the spot for not doing their job. Would term limits help? Or maybe making a personal appearance at their offices more frequently? I would be open to any idea that would get Washington to pass, and enforce, even one of these proposals.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do not, future generations of Americans will reside in a Third World nation, and it will be a mirror image of Mexico&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Future generations&#8221;? Dave needs to get out a little more often. Huge swaths of our states and cities are already there.</p>

		<p>Dave Gibson&rsquo;s plan is almost perfect.  The employers of these illegals should be heavily fined and after three strikes, face the firing squad.  After all treason should be a capital offense.  After all, it used to be&hellip; before the Marxists ruined this once great nation.<br>

1. Penalize landlords whorent to illegals. There is a small town in Central Pennsylvania that has adopted this policy.</p>
<p>2. Stop the &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; entitlements. If the baby is born of an illegal then the baby should be illegal.</p>

		<p>From web site, I find out how many school buses are in the US. I divided that into the number of illegals. It would take only 15 weeks. Mind you, we can also use airplanes, trains, and boats, and many will leave on their own.<br>
   Mass deportation is do able. Lets start!</p>

<p>Assume 2,500,000 Muslims and 200 Muslims on a plane.<br>

		<p>Our immigration laws are insane, and are routinely not enforced, those laws were written and voted in by liberals seeking ways to secure power for themselves and future little socialist(no difference between liberal and socialist). The only way we can upset their runaway train is getting the message out to voters, noone, who is sane wants this country overrun by groups of uneducated, unethical, and basically unemployable coming here clogging our systems.</p>

		<p>Lotta good ideas here but the sad truth that it all goes back to the politicans who run this country. They have made white Ameicans who have built this country out as the criminals while the browns &amp; blacks are cast as the poor oppressed people. All this for the brown &amp; black vote so the politicans can have their continual party of theft and debauchery in Washington.</p>

		<p>The program to rid our country of illegal immigrants shall include:<br>
o	Clarify law to show that there is no statute of limitations on illegal immigration.<br>
o	Accurate ID, such as the drivers license standards recently put in place.<br>
o	Immediate computerized identification (using the ICE and FBI system) of known illegal aliens should be made available to every sheriff.  Every person admitted to a jail should have an identity check.<br>
o	Court approval to card Latins based on their race and appearance.  This is justified by the danger they pose to America through colonization, taking jobs, etc.<br>
o	Compensated repatriation.  Help them move back home.  Such payments are vouchers made to service providers to reduce fraud.  Biometric registration for repatriated persons.  Illegals in this program can never return.  This program should be active for three years, most of a Presidential term.  <br>
o	After the compensated repatriation period lapses, immediate repatriation is the norm.  Allow bail agents to find and bring illegals into ICE centers, pay for it through confiscation of property rather than spending public moneys.<br>
o	Establish substantial bail for identified illegal aliens who come to the attention of law enforcement, sufficient to hire commercial bounty hunters to compel court appearance.  Bail skippers automatically under sentence of summary deportation, and commercial bounty hunters immediately put on their trail.  Substantial bail means that illegal aliens  will foot the bill for their return to the court system, not the public.<br>
o	Move immigration court system away from the Executive to the Federal Court System. <br>
o	Court case or new law as appropriate to eliminate 14th Amendment &ldquo;anchor babies.&rdquo;<br>
o	Armed soldiers patrol the border, with orders to shoot persons who do not immediately obey orders to stop.  We are facing invasion and colonization, and military standards of conduct are appropriate.</p>

		<p>If only our government cared enough to close our borders and enforce our immigration laws&hellip;  If only our government cared enough for the safety and welfare of the American people&hellip;</p>
<p>Both &#8220;sides&#8221; of our government (Republican and Democrat) have been working together for decades to lead us to a &#8220;global society&#8221;&hellip;  Integration and multiculturalism at all costs for the &#8220;free trade of goods, services and people&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Sovereign countries with borders are so passe in our ever-growing &#8220;global&#8221; society&hellip;  Huge trading blocks such as the European Union, the Asian Union, the Mediterranean Union, the forming of the South American Union and soon to be North American Union will make up our &#8220;New World Order.&#8221;  A fantastic boon for the ruling class (our few global elites at the top) but not so good for the rest of us&hellip;</p>
<p>We still have a chance to save what&rsquo;s left of America, her values and traditions and our standard of living, but only if we&rsquo;re willing to stand up to our ever-growing and controlling government.</p>
<p>We the People must stand up for freedom and fight for what&rsquo;s right or lose America as we know it.</p>

		<p>Many of Dave&rsquo;s idea&rsquo;s are good ones:</p>
<p>-Put and keep permanantly our military on the border. Take our troops from Germany etc. and other places. The American military should be defending American soil, not European, Asian or other soil. The American taxpayer shouldn&rsquo;t be subsidizing defence in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>-Implement the E-verify program</p>
<p>-All employers must use the e-verify program. Any CEO caught not using this program gets a warning first, a huge fine second and a year long prison sentence and even bigger fine third with further harsher penalties.</p>
<p>-Landlords are not to rent to illegals.</p>
<p>-Any child that can&rsquo;t speak English  when being enrolled in school, the parents must prove citizenship or legal residency.</p>
<p>-Get rid of the anchor baby provision</p>
<p>-Any people applying for welfare or public assistance must show proof of citizenship</p>
<p>-Jails and the police are allowed to check legal residency status for non-English speakers or those who speak it poorly</p>
<p>-Federal funds cut off to any type of &#8220;sanctary&#8221; cities</p>
<p>Implement these and one year from now, most illegals self-deport back to Mexico and the rest would stop coming. We&rsquo;d also stop crime, drug cartels and drugs, potetential terrorists, diseases like TB etc. from coming into the USA. We&rsquo;d save billions upon billions, the economy would pick up as our working class would now have a lot more jobs, our schools, jails and hospitals would be free of the massive overflow and our streets would be much safer and cleaner.</p>

		<p>California has a $26 billion dollar budget deficit, services to illegal aliens are estimated to cost $15 to $20 billion dollars but no elected representative dares to suggest elimination of services to illegal aliens as one answer to reduce the deficit. The democrats see illegal aliens as future democrat voters and republicans are happily taking money from agribusiness and other businesses that depend on the labor of illegals. </p>

		<p>I think it is wishful thinking to say if we take any the &#8220;goodies&#8221; illegal immigration will stop.</p>
<p>Even without goodies life is better in the U.S. for immigrants than it was in their former country.</p>
<p>Mass deportations are never going to happen.</p>
<p>The only solution is the U.S. military on the Mexican border and stopping people from boarding airplanes headed for the U.S.</p>

		<p>With most of the illegals sending us currency back to mexico, let&rsquo;s set laws in place to forbid mailing us currency out of the country. And arrest those who do while seizing alk the moneys to fund the deportation effort. This would also curb so of the drug trade.</p>

		<p>While I seriously doubt that our Parliament of Whores will enact any or all of these measures, the one thing individual Americans can do is refuse to do business with any company that they know or suspect is using illegal alien labor.  One way of doing that is verifying that the companies themselves use e-verify.  </p>
<p>If enough Americans do that, the companies will be forced to do that to stay in business.  They will even advertise that they use e-verify to acquire more business.  </p>

<p>This is true of Western nations but I guarantee that if you sneak into Saudia or Kuwait you WILL BE TREATED AS A CRIMINAL, deportation from there is AFTER prison and only to and across the nearest border on pain of death if caught again. One of the few things I admire of muslim countries is their immigration policy and there is no such thing as an &#8220;Anchor baby&#8221; you can NEVER become a citizen of those countries.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Millions of school children are bused daily to and from school in this country. During the summer break, employ bus drivers for &ldquo;shovel ready jobs&rdquo;, driving the thousands of idle school buses, across the border depositing people back to their home country.&#8221;</p>
<p>LOL..did you get that idea from me? <br>

<p>I sum up the situation pretty well at the end:</p>
<p>There is no shortage of poor US citizens, black, white and brown. If the US welfare state were dramatically pared back, the demand for illegal labor would evaporate over night.<br>

 All are good ideas, but #4 would require a Supreme Court<br>
reversal of the infamous Plyler decision,</p>
<p> Given that the current make-up of the Court is much more<br>
favorable than it was at the time of the Plyler case,<br>
and that it may never be as favorable again, I&rsquo;d like to<br>
see such a challenge as soon as possible. </p>

		<p> Sen Dick Durbin, IL, is part of the problem. He has sponsored the DREAM Act for children of illegal aliens. He cares more for the brown vote than the white majority. The stupid people of Illinois overwhelmingly reelected this clown. We deserve whatever we get.</p>
