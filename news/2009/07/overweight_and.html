This is a good website to use to counter claims that blacks are under-served or neglected by the health care industry.</p>
<p>If you look on the left, you&rsquo;ll find a list of health status indicators, some of the major ones broken down by race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>While blacks may claim that the reason that more blacks die from cancer is because the health care system is racist, if you look under Cancer Incidence by Race/Ethnicity,</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/l8xwe3" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/l8xwe3</a></p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that blacks are reported as having higher incidents of cancer. Whether this is genetics or chosen lifestyle, since incidents are higher, obviously black cancer deaths will be higher.</p>
<p>How many of the following are caused by racism, lifestyle, or genetics?</p>

		<p>Well gee, MSNBC somehow missed this today.  Instead they kept focusing on obesity rates by state, and kept overemphasizing how the Deep South (where I am from) was costing the rest of the nation massive healthcare costs. Not once was race ever mentioned.  </p>
<p>I guess liberals enjoy attacking &#8220;victim groups&#8221;, such as obese people who &#8220;can&rsquo;t help themselves&#8221;, when they are specifically targeting Southern whites.  And why is this suddenly a concern for liberals?  They don&rsquo;t make a huge deal about who is costing who in healthcare under any other circumstances.  Liberals make me sick.</p>

		<p>Blacks are the most overweight and in particular Black women.  The weight of an average Black woman of about 40 is 190 lbs. according to CDC stats.  This is as heavy as an AVERAGE HEAVYWEIGHT BOXER 50 YEARS AGO.  Why is this so?  One would think that such a disadvantaged group as Blacks who have so much less money than those evil White devils would be scrimping and saving every penny that they have in order to make ends meet.  Surely people who are not well off should be lighter in weight because they don&rsquo;t have to funds to binge on food right?  Well, maybe they&rsquo;re not so not well off after all.  They have more money now than ever.  It&rsquo;s a fact that people with lower IQ&rsquo;s are less concerned about their health than people with higher IQ&rsquo;s.  It&rsquo;s also a fact (some dispute it) that Blacks have higher testosterone levels than Whites (the women included).  The ultra heavy weight makes them feel &#8220;powerful&#8221;. Did you ever see the typical severely overweight Black welfare mama?  Did you ever see her walk down the street bumping into any White person who dares get in her way?  The extra weight makes them feel extra powerful.  Sound crazy?  Next time you&rsquo;re walking down a crowded city street or a Walmart and there&rsquo;s a fat Black mama or mamas walking in the opposite direction see how far they move for you.  The worst part of this is that WE pay the price in increased insurance rates due to the fact that obesity has negative health effects.  We pay for their stupidity.  We pay for their heart disease.  We pay for their strokes.  We pay for their blood clots.  We pay for their emergency room visits - and - we get robbed, raped, chased out of our neighborhoods, and murdered too.</p>
<p>-Oh and I almost forgot, pretty soon King Obama will make us evil White devils pay reparations too.</p>

<p>That pisses me off.</p>
<p>Not grammatically correct? Usually, probably not. But in this case I would argue in this context it is. </p>
<p>Whites = European Americans, therefore in this case it should be capitalized. Same thing with Black.</p>
<p>So it all depends on the context and how the word is being used.</p>

		<p>1. There are trim blacks. Most of them are in jail. A handful are in the NFL or NBA.<br>
2.  Shame on whites. We can be a small minority compared with the colored majority of the future, but if we&rsquo;re tough, in shape, and retain intellectual sharpness, we&rsquo;ll stay on top. If we get fat, eventually the brain suffers and we will deserve the Zimbabwe genocide treatment the brown and black masses throw our way. (Zimbabwe farmers are usually in great shape, just not enough of them.) <br>
3. The Indians.(native &#8216;americans&rsquo;) What can you say? They had the country. They blew it. Now they&rsquo;re fat and living off us.<br>
I admire the Apache and other warrriors who went down fighting.<br>
4. The Chinese? Give em another generation of American cooking. They&rsquo;ll be fat too.  </p>

		<p>Blubberlyness is just a social construct. Just have a squad of Boas-ified activists tell them how really svelte they are, and <br>
 they all deserve to be employed as Jockeys at the track. They should however, demand to be paid more than the other jockeys due to past descrimination. It&rsquo;s worked before. There- problem solved! That wasn&rsquo;t so hard.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a little surprised to see the black obese percentage higher than Indians.</p>
<p>I lived in California, Colorado, Texas, Nevada, and Arizona, and I was always with the impression that about 90% of all the Indians I encountered were overweight, especially the women.</p>
<p>Also, the Mexicans with zero or very little Spanish blood seemed to have about the same percentage of obese people, again mostly women, but, then again, they truly are &#8220;Indians&#8221; and not Mexicans or mestizos. </p>
<p>While, I&rsquo;ve noticed a LOT of very heavy black women, I&rsquo;m not sure I can believe the black obesity percentage is larger than Indians. </p>

		<p>An interesting study worth thinking about. I read an article, I believe from the Atlantic Magazine, about obesity and culture. In cultures in which farming has been established the longest, genes which promote diabetes 2 are selected against; so-called &#8220;hunger genes&#8221; die out because the effect is to retain body weight. Since in hunter-gatherer times the possiblity of near-starvation was ever present these hunger genes were advantageous, but when food supply is relatively certain they are not. Thus, obesity related diabetes 2 correlates with length of time civilized. I recall reading that diabetes 2 is rampant in the South Pacific, which until recently were fishing and gathering subsistence cultures. One writer described the situation in a local hospital wherein the sweet, acetone-like smell of diabetes 2 pervaded the corridors, and where amputated limbs were a common site.</p>

		<p>Half of all Indians(India Indians) have a gene related to obesity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sequence, discovered by a team led by Imperial College London, is carried by 50% of the population - but is a third more common in Indian Asians. </p>
<p>The finding might provide a possible genetic explanation for the particularly high levels of obesity in Indian Asians, who make up 25% of the world&rsquo;s population, but who are expected to account for 40% of global cardiovascular disease by 2020.&#8221;<br>

<p>Orientals are skinny; Indians not so much. I&rsquo;ve read that among white ethnic groups, Jewish people are the slimmest. Perhaps intelligence and obesity are related?</p>

<p>Not true. The BMI has been as faulty as a lot of other methods of measuring bodyfat. For instance, while blacks have low subcutaneous fat compared to other races, they tend to store fat in the buttocks (a genetic trait/mechanism that actually keeps the body cooler in high temperatures, like those in sub-Saharan Africa). This can result in the situation of a black male looking very low in bodyfat while actually carrying several lbs of compressed fat on his backside that isn&rsquo;t &#8220;noticed&#8221; as such. By the time various racial groups hit middle age, it&rsquo;s easily discernible who&rsquo;s fattest. Hispanics and blacks lead, not by a small margin (with an exception I&rsquo;ll note below). Next are Whites, then most Asians. However, here in L.A. there are now so many fat, lardy Asians, men and women, kids and teens, one has to wonder if they are as inefficient at processing Western food as other non-whites. If all Asians took up a full Western diet, I think they&rsquo;d pass Whites in the fatty dept. But for the most part, the smaller framed folks of most races tend to do better in keeping off the lard - except for the Hispanics. Asiatic Indians seem to be overall a trim people here in CA, you see fat ones of course, but they tend to be the exception. Fat people in general used to be the exception, but there truly is an epidemic of obesity in the US, and Whites are right in the middle of it, especially White women I hate to say. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that while it is in fact true that only a small percentage of White women nationally actually date black males, it seems the majority that do are obese. </p>
<p>There are better ways to actually measure bodyfat and studies have been done (easily looked up). The results are not posted in the MSM as they generally show most non-whites, while possibly appearing &#8220;fit&#8221; when young in terms of bodyfat %, hitting higher numbers than most &#8220;White&#8221; ethnic groups from the late 20&rsquo;s, early 30&rsquo;s on in age. The BMI discriminates against muscular people, heavy boned (not meaning fat) people etc. Some athletes in great condition can produce morbid numbers on the BMI.</p>
<p>On a side note, &#8220;Pacific Islanders&#8221; are not slim. This is the exception I mentioned above. Hawaiians and Samoans are the fattest peoples, period. They are far ahead of Hispanics and blacks, but nationally they don&rsquo;t make much of an impact due to their small numbers. But anyone here in SoCal or Hawaii can tell you they are incredibly obese groups of people. Some are quite large and muscular when young, and then they start to fall apart when they hit their late 20&rsquo;s on. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s absurd for the authors to lump Asians and Pacific Islanders together as a single ethnic group because they&rsquo;re combining the thinnest group (Orientals)with perhaps the most obese group of all (Polynesians).</p>

		<p>Not very shocking. The &#8216;white&rsquo; category is 59.6%!? That&rsquo;s unbelievable. It&rsquo;s an embarrassment, really.</p>
<p>Overweight/obesity statistics are interesting because they conflict so heavily with the sort of picture that we had a few generations ago. In 1900, for instance, obesity was basically unheard of. There were a few naturally big people, but essentially everyone was in good physical condition. This is similar to the situation in modern Japan (almost no fat people). Now, poor dietary habits combined with dysgenics have produced a totally different situation for us here. </p>
<p>The lingo that is used is also interesting. We don&rsquo;t call them &#8216;fat&rsquo; anymore, instead we call them &#8216;overweight&rsquo;. I guess this protects their feelings from getting hurt. Also, we now call people &#8216;obese&rsquo;, when before we probably would&rsquo;ve called such people &#8216;dangerously fat&rsquo;. Hmm, perhaps this kind of &#8216;soft language&rsquo; has only exacerbated the problem and it easier to not care about physical appearance/health?  If someone was fat, we called them fat. Soon, it will probably get even worse, and we&rsquo;ll start calling them &#8216;horizontally challenged&rsquo; rather than obese. </p>
