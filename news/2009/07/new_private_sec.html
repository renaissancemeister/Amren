			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Savill, Telegraph (London), June 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of British workers aged between 16 and 65 in the private sector has actually declined by nearly 90,000 since 1997, according to an analysis of official employment data.</p>
<p>The research, commissioned by the Cross-Party Group on Balanced Migration, found that a third of new public sector jobs also went to non British workers.</p>
<p>These figures show that 1.1 million new jobs have been created in the public sector of which 28 per cent went to non British workers.</p>
<p>In the private sector there were 1.8 million new jobs, but 85 per cent went to non British workers.</p>
<p>An increase in the number of older people choosing to remain in employment also limited the opportunities available for Britons considered of working age.</p>
<p>Commenting on the figures, the MPs Frank Field and Nicholas Soames, who are co-chairmen of the Balanced Migration group, said: &#8220;These figures tell a simple story: in the private sector it has been British jobs for foreign workers. The private sector should now match the public sector in ensuring local people have the first chance at gaining local jobs&#8221;.<br>

		<p>There is a British political party that advocates British jobs for British workers.  Last I looked, the Telegraph bashes that party without fail and without cease.</p>

<p>In other words, a third of new public sector jobs went to non British workers but don&rsquo;t blame the non British workers. Instead, blame older Britons for not retiring fast enough and making more jobs available for&hellip; more non British workers. Un-freaking-believable!</p>

		<p>The irony is that the British Labour Party was established in the first place with only one objective in mind - to fight for the interests of the british working class - that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the Labour Party.<br>
  Mrs Thatcher was demonized by the Labour Party for her alleged assaults on working class interests - actually they pale in comparison to the way the Labour Party has effectively sold out the working class for cheap, foreign labor - which only benefits the boss class, of course.</p>

		<p>&#8216;A third of new public sector jobs went to non-British workers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This is real revelation.Invariably it is the case, in any nation,be it first world or third world, that public sector jobs are the most sought after and as they reflect the ruling establishment and character of the nation they are always reserved for natives of good character and good family who have been established for many years.<br>
 Usually, immigrants get what&rsquo;s left over - the insecure private sector jobs, for example it is unthinkable that the Japanese civil service would employ a non-Japanese in any capacity and that immigrants to Japan do anything other than tidy-up after the Japanese.<br>
 That Britain has got this back to front really shows the dire state of that nation.</p>
