<h1>Black Students Recount Early Days of Integration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Sluss, Roanoke Times, July 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For some of the black students who took the first steps toward integrating Virginia&rsquo;s public schools more than a half-century ago, the memories of their hardships have not faded with time.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the worst two and a half years of my life,&#8221; said Andrew Heidelberg, one of 17 black students to attend previously all-white Norfolk public schools in 1959, as Virginia&rsquo;s efforts to resist racial integration began slowly to unravel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people really don&rsquo;t understand how we were treated,&#8221; Heidelberg said Friday at the state Capitol, where former students, lawyers, academics and political leaders examined the legacy of Virginia&rsquo;s &#8220;massive resistance&#8221; movement.</p>
<p>The conference was organized by the University of Virginia&rsquo;s Center for Politics for its 12th annual Virginia Political History Project.</p>
<p>Black students recounted the fear, verbal abuse and other indignities they suffered when they ventured into all-white schools. Political leaders, including two former governors, recalled the extreme steps Virginia&rsquo;s government took to keep blacks from attending school with whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s massive resistance policy was the state&rsquo;s final attempt to defy the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954 and subsequent federal court orders to integrate public schools. The state&rsquo;s resistance was effectively led by former Gov. and U.S. Sen. Harry Byrd, whose conservative Democratic organization dominated state and local politics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the fall of 1958, several schools in Norfolk, Charlottesville and Warren County were closed to evade court orders to integrate, but courts forced the schools to reopen in February 1959.</p>
<p>But the students who integrated those schools {snip} encountered threats, epithets and ugly stereotypes, even from adults. Delores Brown, who joined Heidelberg at Norfolk&rsquo;s Norview High School, said an administrator refused to let her take a physical education class and told her, &#8220;You&rsquo;re not going to be dirtying up our showers, now go on to your class.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Henry Cabarrus recalled the fear he felt when he joined in a lawsuit challenging the closing of schools in Prince Edward County, which remained closed until 1964.</p>
<p>&#8220;People will see me, they&rsquo;ll know me and they&rsquo;ll kill me,&#8221; he remembered thinking.</p>
<p>The demise of massive resistance did not trigger swift integration of public schools. Virginia preserved various forms of &#8220;passive resistance,&#8221; developing freedom-of-choice plans and repealing compulsory attendance laws. Those measures, along with white flight from the cities, slowed the pace of integration in the 1960s. Former Gov. Douglas Wilder, the nation&rsquo;s first elected black governor, told the conference that &#8220;the lingering effects of decades of justifying segregation continues.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilder said massive resistance had devastating consequences for students who were denied educations, and he spared no criticism of those in government and the media who enabled and encouraged the policy. Wilder worried whether younger generations will take advantage of opportunities created for them by those who knocked down the walls of institutional racism.</p>

		<p>So we hear stories from the mainstream media about black students being harassed in school by whites in the 1950&rsquo;s.  How about the mainstream media doing stories about all the white students, after integration, being assaulted, threatened, robbed and called every name in the book by black students that they were forced to go to school with.  There are numerous stories involving these atrocities but you can bet the media will never look for them.  It does&rsquo;nt fit their worldview of the &#8220;white racist oppressor&#8221; and the &#8220;innocent black victim&#8221;. </p>

		<p>The government has no more business imposing integration than it did segregation. That isn&rsquo;t the government&rsquo;s job. Of course, I don&rsquo;t recall seeing anything in the constitution about providing public education, either. Nor, public assistance. Nor public health care. The constitution pretty much limits the federal government to just national defense and a post office.</p>

<p>True &#8216;democracy&rsquo; in action, Soviet style. Who were these &#8220;courts&#8221;? How did they claim to represent the will of the people - the will of the MAJORITY?</p>
<p>How on Earth did any of this travesty take place, when it was so obvious that MOST of the population didn&rsquo;t want it to happen?</p>
<p>What sort of reasoning did the blacks use? &#8220;We are going to force ourselves onto people who don&rsquo;t want us around. We are in the right because they are evil &#8216;racists&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re evil &#8216;racists&rsquo;, why would blacks want to live around them?</p>
<p>In other words, this was the beginning of the end for the white race.</p>
<p>Start demanding democracy NOW, before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

		<p>Now here is a case of history repeating its self. Except the poor whites are the victims and have no one to stick up for them. Their own kind will sell them down the river. A real shame.</p>

<p>However, you were treated is miniscule compared to the black on white atrocities that occurred after that and continue today.</p>
<p>If blacks had any real pride they would have refused to go where they&rsquo;re not wanted, but they attach themselves to whites like leeches and refuse to stay among their own kind.</p>
<p>As it stands now, black women reject black men because of their propensity for crime and violence&hellip;..45% of them are unmarried&hellip;..and the men reject their women in favor of other races because they&rsquo;re unattractive.</p>
<p>And, all of them together have brought this country down to near third world levels in many ways.<br>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;It tore Virginia apart and, tragically, the harm will never be understood,&rsquo; said state Sen. Henry Marsh, D-Richmond, who waged school integration battles as a civil rights lawyer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Truer words were never spoken. For it does sometimes seem that &#8220;the harm (integration has done) will never be understood.&#8221; But I&rsquo;m still hoping.</p>
<p>I was a high school senior in Norfolk when the schools closed, and had the distinction of calling the Supreme Court &#8220;a bunch of radicals&#8221; on Edward R. Murrow&rsquo;s televised &#8220;The Lost Class of &#8216;59.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was just an adolescent with no real views at the time, trying to be a smart-aleck, and I went on to become a lefty and regret my remark. But now finally I&rsquo;m proud of it.</p>
<p>The 1954 Supreme Court school desegregation decision, Brown vs. Board of Education, was a case of &#8220;nationjacking&#8221; if there ever was one.</p>
<p>How the evil deed was done was the subject of a  New York Times editorial on March 24, 1987, entitled:</p>
<p>&#8220;With All Deliberate Impropriety&#8221;.</p>
<p>That editorial discussed the highly improper collaboration between Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter and Justice Dept. attorney Philip Elman, assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General at the time, to find ways to overcome the Court&rsquo;s initial opposition to the claims of Brown.</p>
<p>This is discussed in an excellent book review at:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/ovzxgw</p>
<p>(From the review, here&rsquo;s one reaction to Elman&rsquo;s disclosures at the time):</p>
<p>&#8220;Erwin N. Griswold, a former solicitor general and dean of Harvard Law School, was &#8216;startled&rsquo; at the impropriety, as were many others. Griswold said the behavior of Frankfurter and Elman was &#8216;clearly regarded as improper at the time and would clearly be improper now.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

<p>There will never be justice for whites, but we thank the Roanoke Times for printing that just the same. </p>

<p>The outcome of this was all known from the beginning &hellip; both to the ideological promoters of this scheme  (mostly big-city academics), and to the helpless Southern whites it affected.    </p>
<p>Of course, the blacks denied this all up and down on a stack of bibles. They only wanted a good education; that was ALL.  Nothing more!   But still,  whites deep in their hearts knew what this was  really all about.  And  precisely that is what has come to pass   &mdash;   just as they feared. </p>
<p>But today, the brainwashed grandchildren of the South have no regrets.  They enthusiastically welcome  integration  (which has now expanded into  &#8220;multi-culturalism&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221;). According to what I am told by southern friends, they lecture their elderly grandparents and scold them for being  silly fuddyduddy old racists.  Naturally, the young  today are much wiser and more enlightened than former generations,  far better &#8220;educated&#8221;,  and they know better than their ignorant grandparents did.  Why listen to those backward old fossils? </p>
<p>So all will be well with the world from now on, now that we&rsquo;re finally on the right path to Utopia.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>

		<p>I live next to Petersburg, VA, another southern city that used to be nice until integration.  In fact, it had a high school (now the middle school)that was for blacks that was known for academic excellence.  Now after three decades of black rule the city schools are abysmal and the state has threatened to take over.</p>
