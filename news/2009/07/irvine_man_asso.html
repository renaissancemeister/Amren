			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal grand jury has indicted an Irvine man and an associate for allegedly trying to bribe a U.S. Army contracting official with $1 million to win a road construction project in Afghanistan, the Justice Department said Thursday.</p>
<p>Rohullah Farooqi Lodin of Irvine and Hashmatullah Farooqi of New York City are each charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud and commit an offense against the United States and one count of attempting to bribe a public official.</p>
<p>The indictment, filed in federal court in Virginia, alleges that the men offered $1 million in bribes to an Army captain, who is not named in the court documents.</p>
<p>In exchange, the officer was to help disqualify lower bidders to build a road in Logar province and award the project to two general contracting firms in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Lodin and Farooqi allegedly claimed to represent the companies, which each submitted $18-million bids for the work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the indictment, on at least four occasions in May, Lodin and Farooqi met with the Army captain, who was the public official responsible for managing the emergency program in Logar, which is south of Kabul.</p>
<p>Lodin and Farooqi allegedly said they had political connections and could arrange for the blacklisting of lower-priced bidders whose offers were ranked ahead of theirs. The indictment says Lodin and Farooqi discussed several options for paying the officer, including wiring him the $1 million through a bank account in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, or Bangkok, Thailand.</p>

<p>WHAT?  With names like that no doubt native Californians and New Yorkers.  We can not find American contractors?  Lets just outsource the whole country!  Starting with the President and Congress.  We couldn&rsquo;t find a worse bunch rulers at any price.</p>

		<p>It is not just the Levantines.</p>
<p>My brother runs a lumber yard in Memphis, TN and he says he is totally sickened by all the bribes people (foremen and such) want to just let him bid on supplying a job.</p>
<p>And the people wanting bribes are not all Black either, not by a long shot. But when you deal with the city government, which is mostly Black, you get the same treatment in quantities.</p>

		<p>This could be a case where &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; benefits the group. Real scientist say multiculturalism creates an atmosphere of increasing distrust. Trying to bribe someone who doesn&rsquo;t even share your original language, let alone your race, doesn&rsquo;t seem like a very good idea. Perhaps the bribee and the briber in this case are both non-white and the one thing they thought they could agree on was sticking it to the white man or uncle sam. </p>

		<p>Still more &#8220;wonders of diversity&#8221;<br>
This sort of corruption is commonplace where many immigrants come from, &#8220;greasing the palm&#8221; is the only way to get corrupt officialdom to do their jobs in many cases.<br>
Now its here, probably nothing new, those from outside our civilized society just more blatant about it, possibly even unaware it is illegal or a breach of ethics.<br>
Sounds like a politician!</p>
