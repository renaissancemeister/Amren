<h1><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/washingtoncounty/index.ssf/2009/07/racial_gap_in_student_achievem.html">Racial Gap in Student Achievement Could Be Cultural Bias, School Leaders Say</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melissa Navas, The Oregonian, July 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of Latino boys gathers in a hallway, laughing and being loud. To one staff member, flags go up: gang activity. But the same staff member ignores a group of white boys shouting at the same decibel level.</p>
<p>Down the hall, a teacher skips over a black student raising her hand in class because she doesn&rsquo;t think the student knows the answer to a math equation.</p>
<p>These cultural biases have their ripple effects in the classroom, showing up in higher test scores for white students and more discipline referrals for students of color. The so-called &#8220;racial achievement gap&#8221; has become even more apparent since federal No Child Left Behind laws passed in 2001 force districts to disaggregate their achievement data based on subcategories, including race, poverty and language ability. Schools are held accountable for academic growth of students in each group.</p>
<p>In 2007, national reading and math assessments showed white students outperformed black, Latino and Native American students by between 20 to 30 percentage points. Asian students were a percentage point higher than white students in reading and 8 percentage points higher in math.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two years ago, Tigard-Tualatin School District contracted with a California company specializing in addressing systemic issues of inequity. The work has allowed the 12,700-student district to focus on disparities in their own racial achievement gap, which averages between 20 and 40 percentage points in middle and high schools.</p>
<p>The district also found discipline variations suggesting that school staff were sending more students of color to the office rather than back to the classroom, and imposing more punishments on them than white students.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it about our system that is causing these results?&#8221; said Carla Randall, director of curriculum and instruction.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tigard-Tualatin administrators and some staff have met for two years in behind-the-scenes discussions about how to solve the district&rsquo;s racial inequities. The staff, which is 90 percent white, explores their own potential biases, considers the experiences of minority students and examines how the education system may give preferential treatment to white students.</p>
<p>Next year, the conversation moves from staff training to the classroom where trainers will provide guidance to teachers in considering students&rsquo; cultures and making sure that their lessons are inclusive of students of color. Eventually, district leaders plan to include students in the conversation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Changing demographics</b></p>
<p>In Oregon, racial demographics are shifting rapidly.</p>
<p>From 1980 to 2007, the number of foreign-born immigrants living in Oregon has more than tripled to about 367,000 people. And between 1998 and 2008, the number of minority students in Oregon schools increased 80 percent to 168,000.</p>
<p>Tigard-Tualatin&rsquo;s minority population has more than doubled in the last decade. The largest influx is Latino students, who grew from about 9 percent in 1999 to 19 percent, or 2,400 students, today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tigard-Tualatin&rsquo;s white students outperform most other student groups particularly in middle and high school reading and math assessments. For instance, in high school math, white students are 30 to 40 percentage points higher than black and Latino students. In high school reading, white students were between 14 and 44 percentage points higher than Asian, black and Latino students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite more rigorous standards nationwide, the achievement gap hasn&rsquo;t shrunk because all students groups have made gains in recent years, allowing the gap to persist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tigard-Tualatin&rsquo;s rollout of the program is intentionally slow so most parents and students won&rsquo;t see visible changes in classrooms, Randall said. Some administrators said the process takes time because participants must first examine their own assumed biases and cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>Jeff Smith, principal at Tualatin High School, said the discussions on race have been some of the best professional development in his 31 years as an educator. He said he&rsquo;s gained empathy about what it&rsquo;s like to be &#8220;born into a world where there&rsquo;s certainly more privilege to be white than a person of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pedro Noguera, a professor at New York University and author of several books including &#8220;Unfinished Business: Closing the Racial Achievement Gap in Our Schools,&#8221; said it&rsquo;s important for educators and school staff to carefully include students in discussions about race. If a conversation backfires, an environment can become so charged, that paralysis could kick in, he said.</p>

		<p>So much for cultural bias, if Asians finished slightly ahead of whites.  </p>
<p>This whole nonsense about &#8220;cultural bias,&#8221; IIRC, came about several decades ago when the SAT had one question on the verbal section that required you to know the basic anatomy of a yacht.  That&rsquo;s been the black/Hispanic excuse machine since then.  Then again, nobody really thinks to ask the obvious question:  If you&rsquo;re taking the SAT, you want to go to college.  And if you&rsquo;re that kind of person, wouldn&rsquo;t it behoove you, as a person that is aware of the SAT&rsquo;s history as a northeastern Brahmin/elitist construct, to learn the basic anatomy of a yacht?  It shouldn&rsquo;t be so hard to do.  </p>

		<p>What would be a fascinating study would be to study hispanic achievement by actual racial and ethnic sub-group, and not as the monolithic hispanic category.  In terms of IQ and other measures of academic success how would a Mexican Indian stack up against a black Dominican, mulato Puerto Rican or a white Cuban?  That would most interesting.  I bet it would be just more of how intelligence is inherited.<br>

<p>In plain language we see what it is that the racial egalitarians want.  They want whites to fail and blacks and browns to gain.  The educators should be celebrating the fact that all students have made gains but that would mean celebrating white achievement as well, and we know that is unacceptable.</p>

		<p>Of course it&rsquo;s cultural bias to these traitorous leftists. There won&rsquo;t be cultural bias, once the American culture is eliminated by these leftist traitors. God help this country that is so in danger, by helping it to rid itself of these traitors.</p>
<p>P.S. I realize my writing style isn&rsquo;t up to par at times, but I have not overlooked the fact that I used a form of the word &#8220;traitor&#8221; too often. It was on purpose, that I did so.</p>

Ha! How d&rsquo;you like that?  Those racist white kids don&rsquo;t want minorities to catch up to them academically - instead, they&rsquo;re &#8220;allowing the gap to persist.&#8221;  Even with all the gangsta rap they listen to, the &#8220;wiggers&#8221; and the &#8220;wannabes,&#8221; and the white girls dating and mating black bucks, they still can&rsquo;t honor &#8220;diversity&#8221; and just let themselves degrade all the way to the level of blacks and Hispanics!

		<p>White males are held to a higher standard than their counterparts; in the USA whites are forced to achieve at much higher levels to obtain similar results&hellip; if whites fail to achieve, society imposes punishments: this is called affirmative action; in which preferential treatment will be giving peoples of other persuasions, this a lesson that whites males must learn. Blacks and Latinos take priority.</p>

If everyone was treated equally, that would be unfair to minorities.  <br>

<p>Really, this is how people think? Loud Latinos equals gang members?</p>
<p>The real test is when you correct the behavior, what happens next. Do they continue? Do they blow you off? Does it get worse? Do they take responsibility for their actions and alter their behavior?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not about them, it&rsquo;s about OUR PERCEPTION of them. Their behavior and ability to see what they&rsquo;re doing as wrong and willingness to change their behavior doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s us. It&rsquo;s always us. WE are the problem. Our biases, our prejudices are &#8216;the problem&rsquo;. WE have to alter OUR perceptions, alter OUR behavior to become tolerant and accepting of creeps and punks. Then, and only then, will we experience universal racial love.</p>

Some administrators said the process takes time because participants must first examine their own assumed biases and cultural backgrounds.  &mdash;  Translated from Newspeak into English, that means there are still a lot of whites who aren&rsquo;t brainwashed, so rather than shock them with the reality of their displacement, they&rsquo;ll do it slow so the whites don&rsquo;t notice until its too late.</p>

If someone attemps to engage a non-brainwashed white in a conversation about race, the white may defend themself and attempts to instill racial guilt will not work.</p>

		<p>Has anyone realized that if all races has the same IQ, then Charles Darwin had to be wrong? Traits evolve differently in isolated groups.</p>
<p>The only way that all races could have the same intelligence, aptitudes, levels of aggression, honesty, is for there to be souls sitting out thereto be randomly assigned to the different races.</p>
<p>Either races differ or Darwin was wrong. You cannot have it both ways. <br>

<p>There are few blacks who want to broach this topic and I can think of three reasons.</p>
<p>One is that if they call for segregated schools, that would be an admission that their leaders from the past were wrong about integration and &#8220;the dream&#8221; has been a failure. No black man wants to prove St. MLK JR wrong.</p>
<p>Another is that they know integration has been a failure but they fear that segregation would be even worse. Even though being around whites is bad for them, they know that being around whites gets them access to stuff they don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;d get otherwise. </p>
<p>Also, blacks know how all about black behavioral problems. They know black youths are uncontrollable. If they segregated, they would be forced to deal with black behavior. As long as schools are integrated, they can blame all black pathologies on whites. <br>

		<p>OMG! If I hear one more time about how black children get disciplined more often and more harshly than white, I think that I will scream. In reality the administrators CONSISTENTLY are easier on blacks than they are on whites, it is just that the behavior of the black students is often much, much worse than that of the whites. White administrators walk around on tiptoes while disciplining black students for fear of being labeled racist. I had an administrator tell me that he couldn&rsquo;t do much with a particularly incorrigible black miscreant that was constantly disrupting my class because the kids mom would scream &#8220;racism&#8221; at the drop of a hat.<br>
One thing that sometimes helps, if I can find a black coach,or other authority figure that knows right from wrong and cares about the kids future, He or she will often volunteer to come down hard on the little rascal. </p>

		<p>Funny how the one thing always left out of the equation is that Hispanics and Blacks don&rsquo;t fare so well in the educational system is because their respective cultures hardly value education as a way to a better life. That is why the Asian students are ahead of Whites, because their parents and culture dictate that study and hard work are very important values to embrace.</p>
<p>But of course to even bring that side of the issue up in the public discourse is instantly labeled as racism, even though it is true. Instead, liberals come up with study after study that changes nothing while the same question is brought up again and again for the next study group to re-hash.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve been over this ground before - all for naught. I know that most of you have heard the Einstein observation that insanity is performing the same process again and again expecting to get different results. Our elites continue to persist in this insanity. The results don&rsquo;t change. They never will. Eventually a societal breakdown will occur and we won&rsquo;t have any more time or money for this form of insanity. That breakdown is being facilitated by the handpuppets for the elites that continually occupy the highest positions of leadership throughout the alleged civilzed world.</p>

		<p>White students do better in school than blacks and Hispanics because they have a higher average IQ. It&rsquo;s just that simple. The Establishment can either acknowledge this or continue to court futility in its ever-evolving quest to eliminate &ldquo;learning gaps&rdquo; between the races. Okay, so maybe acknowledging inequality is unpleasant but is it fair to scapegoat whites when the true culprit is genetics rather than white &ldquo;racism?&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s the bigot here?</p>

		<p>If all races had identical IQ it would be the most amazing finding of our time.  Science would be at a loss to explain how it could have occurred.  How could different groups of people living apart for tens of thousands of years become identical?</p>
<p>Of cource, the answer is they are not.  Each race hase evolved its own characteristic skin color, height, disease resistance, physiological abilities (such as the ability to handle alcohol or lactose), and intelligence.  This is called &#8220;DIVERSITY&#8221; and is considered a great strength. We should celebrate this racial diversity in intelligence.  </p>

		<p>This is right in my neck of the woods.  I&rsquo;ve lived in this area for a couple of year and have yet to see ANY gang activity involving whites.  So it should be no wonder that:</p>
<p>&#8220;A group of Latino boys gathers in a hallway, laughing and being loud. To one staff member, flags go up: gang activity. But the same staff member ignores a group of white boys shouting at the same decibel level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hispanics and blacks form gangs - which then either fight each other or harass whites.  Whites do NOT form gangs.  Therefore, the above reaction is an example of postjudice, not prejudice. </p>

<p>This &#8220;reporter&#8221; describes scenarios that have no basis in reality; At least none she cares to cite.</p>
<p>What are the names of the &#8220;staff members&#8221; who disciplined latinos but not Whites? On what date did this occur? What teacher passed over black children with their hands raised only to call on Whites? In my experience, liberal white teachers go out of their way to involve blacks in classroom activities (only to be accused of picking on them). </p>

		<p>Of course the schools are &#8220;culchly biased&#8221;.  They were instituted to pass culture on.  So naturally there is (or should be) a bias toward culture.  Which is something not all people have.</p>
<p>By the way, the name Tualatin means &#8220;sluggish or lazy&#8221; in Kalapuyan.  (Aha!)</p>
<p>The original white settlers misheard this, and called it the Quality River. I think the Indians were right the first time!</p>

		<p>Of all the great socio-political lies of our time(which are legion), this &#8220;education achievement-gap&#8221; canard is surely the one most likely to be accompanied by the sudden onset of profound and willful intellectual blindness of a most astonishing nature! Every conceivable nonsense has been trotted out to explain away this allegedly mind-boggling mystery&hellip;except the most obvious and likely cause that is. </p>
<p>One could compile an entire book, nay, a library of these wide-ranging if altogether predictable diatribes about &#8220;cultural bias&#8221; and all the other similarly baseless and ridiculous assertions that a five-year-old can see through&hellip;but high paid, self-important academics cannot. </p>

		<p>As an educator myself,I have learned to follow the usual practice of soldiers in the Army when at meetings, &#8220;Never ask questions and never volunteer for anything.&#8221; What is amazing is how some very intelligent individuals, such as recently brainwashed Teaching Fellows, follow the party line when it comes to white guilt and the idea that somehow creating better teaching methodology will allow the schools to close the achievement gap between whites and other minorities. (except for Asians, of course) The &#8220;Emperor&rsquo;s New Pair of Clothes&#8221; story well applies to what is going on in the education racket nowadays and so far there are only marginalized thinkers - like most of those who post on American Renaissance - who realize what is going on and are willing to share ideas with each other.</p>

		<p>There! I knew it was a White plot&hellip; making tests deliberately difficult for the sole purpose of making underachieving Blacks &#8220;look stupid.&#8221; Just like it was the Whites&rsquo; fault that Africans on the home continent languished in barely above Stone Age culture for the past 50 milleniums&hellip; until the arrival of Whites forcibly dragged them into the present.</p>
<p>Seriousl, when, if ever, will these perpetual whiners and crybabies ever mature enough to look in the mirror and admit they, themselves, are responsible for what they are?</p>
<p>Ten thousand years from now, that is if Betelguese hasn&rsquo;t gone supernova and blasted all life from this planet, Blacks will still be whining about slavery and discriminashun, and expect and demand reparations for every new generation.</p>

		<p>White culture is dying. Whites in the good old USA are expected to be relegated to minority status by the year 2050. <br>
Unending legal and illegal immigration by 3rd world countries together with a decreasing birth rate by white couples in the US spell disaster for America and the West.<br>
Popular culture embraces and indeed encourages race-mixing, and further stigmatizes any white person who publicly stands up for their culture, and voices outrage about the creeping genocide taking place.<br>
I believe in DIVERSITY. What happens to diversity once all the races have mixed together? No more diversity!<br>
White culture created the greatest country on earth, and unless that same culture protects its genetic heritage, America will soon be relegated to a second-rate power, heading for 3rd-world status after that.</p>

		<p>Do these leftist automatons who have been spouting this garbage for over forty years realize that it does not fly anymore, even among the soccer moms at whom it is directed? Institutional racism has gotten so overt that the normally inattentive casual liberals are getting hit with it (&#8220;Mom, I didn&rsquo;t make Cornell med, like you did. Shaneequa took my spot!&#8221;). Wait until they start confiscating white homes directly and giving them over to grinning Somalis or Mexicans. Then authors of the articles like this one will have to email it to people to get it read (but that are what spam filters are for).</p>

		<p>pale rider- The world was 50% white in 1900; 8% in 2000. What will the world look like in 2100? Will the end of whites plunge the world into a new dark age? At what point will the invention and innovation that flows from the European brain end? Orientals may score slightly higher on IQ tests on average, but at the far ends of the bell curve, where the true geniuses reside, the whites dominate. At some point the world will realize that whites are a rare, valuable and endangered species. If only this was recognized now, before it is too late.</p>
<p>Mike- They don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t need to confiscate white homes. All they need to do is increase Section 8 payments.</p>

		<p>Blacks have got to kill this victim mentality outlook and the old &#8216;blame whitey and white <i>privilege&rsquo;</i> routine for their every conceivable failure in society.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because whitey is not always going to be in a secure enough position of power to act as a perpetual scapegoat and CASHCOW, for blacks and their ingrained racial pathologies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m positive that Hispanics and assorted Asiatic ethnicities will eventually <b>control</b> most of the states of America, if not the White House itself which is why it&rsquo;s imperative for white Americans to start looking seriously at carving out their separate slice of America before they&rsquo;re completely overwhelmed and submerged by the entire Third World.</p>
<p>Will our Asiatic cousins be so tolerant of black sensitivities and social needs, and will they elect to continue showering them with all of those taken-for-granted privileges they, the blacks, currently enjoy - like Affirmative Action and job quotas along with extra financial funding in the form of welfare and racial/ cultural pride events etc, that Marxist brainwashed self-loathing whites have been so granting them up to the present day? </p>
<p>Of course not!  After all, the Asiatics can&rsquo;t be historically guilt-tripped into submission and will, given time, prove to be extremely hard task masters toboot. </p>

		<p>What gets me is this whole subject has no scientific basis, it is faith based. Otherwise, the facts would lead them to the obvious conclusion that on average, blacks/hispanics are less intelligent and more lazy than whites and asians. All the spin in the world does not change that fact. Multiculturalism and the belief that all races and cultures are equal is the new religion. You can&rsquo;t prove its existence. One only has to believe it to be true. Frankly, I would not care bit in the world about it if it weren&rsquo;t; 1) in our faces constantly  2) destroying the western culture and race  3) so dangerous to the futures of all white children. Differnet races will only co-exist peacefully up to the point that power is no longer concentrated in one race. Once power equilibrium sets in, a power struggle and civil strife will ensue. And we stupid whites are willingly handing that power over to the minorities. Will they treat us as well as we have treated them over the past 50 years? I fear not.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with this &#8220;cultural bias&#8221; nonsense. Whites don&rsquo;t believe it. Blacks don&rsquo;t believe it. And the people who are saying it don&rsquo;t even believe it. You can put people in the same school. You can put them in the same classroom. You can even team them up as study partners. But you can&rsquo;t make someone  learn who just doesn&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
