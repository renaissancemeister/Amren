			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elizabeth Wright, Issues and Views, July 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last year, on a radio talk show, New York City&rsquo;s former Mayor Ed Koch voiced a cliche that&rsquo;s near and dear to the hearts of many blacks. I was reminded of this cliche while hearing a version of it from a young white man interviewed in Craig Bodeker&rsquo;s documentary, &#8220;A Conversation About Race.&#8221; The man in Bodeker&rsquo;s film remarked that he had seen his black friends &#8220;struggle&#8221; with racism. He had no details to offer about the nature of said &#8220;racism,&#8221; but he expressed dismay over something either perceived, or told to him.</p>
<p>Similarly, Ed Koch had claimed that in this terrible society of America, &#8220;all blacks&#8221; face racism &#8220;every day.&#8221; According to Koch, from the minute a black leaves his home in the morning to go to work, he encounters ugly, persistent racism, which goes on throughout the day. My ears perked up, because I wanted to know in just which city or state or region were blacks being tormented openly and on a daily basis. Mind you, he was talking about the year 2008. Of course, he, like the young man in the Bodeker film, did not offer any examples of this horrendous treatment.</p>
<p>My instinct was to get in touch with Koch and challenge him to pick any black man, and go off to work with him, spending the entire day on his job, as well as remaining with him in the evening. I would have liked for Koch to come back on radio and report on the terrible, racist encounters suffered that day by that black man.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that no such encounters are occurring on a daily basis. The use of the term &#8220;racism&#8221; does not mean today what it meant to a 1930s black sharecropper, whose choices were circumscribed by realities that were out of his hands. These blacks cannot pin down specific instances of meaningful, substantive bias, that is, bias that negatively affects their daily livelihood.</p>
<p>The black who whines about facing a &#8220;struggle&#8221; is not prevented from going about his business, or living his daily life as he chooses. The society he now lives in places no life-threatening obstacles in his path. The degree to which he can prosper is determined by the limitations of his own natural abilities, and vicissitudes of his family, social circle, and upbringing  &mdash;  as is true for everyone else. The very real racism that prevented that 1930s sharecropper from expanding his choices in life is the only type of racism that matters.</p>
<p>However, there are clever blacks who insist on invoking the spirit of that earlier scenario and hyping the &#8220;pain of racism,&#8221; a disposition that a great many whites eagerly buy into. The goal of such blacks is to keep whites preoccupied forever with the Black Cause, while expanding the scope of just what constitutes &#8220;racism.&#8221; That scope, of course, must encompass the very thoughts in the heads of others.</p>
<p>Whenever I insist to some complainer that specific instances of racism be cited, he usually stammers and talks in generalities. &#8220;Well, you know what I mean,&#8221; he will intone, as if I&rsquo;m supposed to fill in the blanks. What he means is that he takes offense at any form of rejection. Although all human beings face personal rejection at the hands of others, these blacks want exemption from such uncertainties in life. They want no leeway for personal discrimination against themselves.</p>
<p>Recently, a commenter on a popular blog expressed that lame black mantra, &#8220;until-you-have-walked-in-my-shoes,&#8221; by claiming that the white commenters in the forum, being people &#8220;who have never experienced racism on a daily basis since the time you were a child,&#8221; could not understand his anguish. Racism, every day, from childhood right into adulthood? Are we really supposed to buy that? And then he really poured it on, by claiming that this racism &#8220;makes your heart start to race, your blood start to boil, and tears start to form in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suspect that if we were to probe deeper into this man&rsquo;s grievances, we would discover some sticky stuff going on here. Does he cry whenever he finds himself rejected socially by a party or parties with whom he wished to engage? Does social rejection send him into mourning? Or, as in the case cited below, from a black blog, might he harbor a host of insecurities that only competent practitioners in the psychological counseling field could deal with adequately?</p>
<p>On the blog, <cite>Within the Black Community,</cite> black blogger &#8220;Constructive Feedback&#8221; writes about the black actor Boris Kodjoe, who complained about a delivery man, who made him feel &#8220;dirty and black,&#8221; at the door of Kodjoe&rsquo;s mansion in Atlanta. Because it appeared from the delivery man&rsquo;s attitude that he did not believe Kodjoe to be the owner of such a grand house, this apparently irked Kodjoe, so much so that he talked about it in public. Is this millionaire actor admitting that his own self-worth rests on the basis of what he thinks others are thinking about him  &mdash;  even a minimum wage delivery man? Constructive Feedback observes:<blockquote>This wealthy Black man&rsquo;s self-worth is still subject to confiscation by the lowliest of service men who ring his door bell .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The only thing at play is the pathology that is resident in the minds of Mr. Kodjoe and other African-Americans who hand over their own self-worth for someone else&rsquo;s blessing. We have people who wear their self-worth on their shirt collar, expecting everyone to validate them about their insecurities. They project these insecurities as &#8220;racial assaults&#8221; upon our entire race.<br/>
</blockquote>It was never put better. This is a subject that blacks discuss all the time, but most whites are fearful of contemplating. When the approval craved is not forthcoming, the cry of &#8220;racism&#8221; against the entire race goes out. And when a degree of deference cannot be extracted from a white especially, as in Professor Henry Louis Gates&rsquo;s interaction with Officer James Crowley, this is another &#8220;assault&#8221; on the black community. Constructive Feedback continues:<blockquote>It is clear that the expectation was for the police to show due deference to this accomplished BLACK professor of great stature at this elite White school. The fact that his outbursts were responded to by the group of police men, just as they would have done to those of a less established person, the peanut gallery feels that this Black man was not treated fairly, per his position.<br/>
</blockquote>The blogger then facetiously asks, about this prestigious Very Important Person,<blockquote>Why didn&rsquo;t they know who Dr. Gates was when they confronted him? Didn&rsquo;t they see him on television with Oprah and Chris Rock, as they connected with their ancestry in Africa from so long ago?<br/>
</blockquote>And, for those who understand the reference to the haughty, 19th century Harvard-educated W.E.B. Du Bois, he adds, &#8220;I detect some W.E.B. DuBois-esque &#8216;Talented Tenth&rsquo; elitism among the commentators. Prof. Gates, director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute, appears to have taken on some of the airs of his mentor.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a mockery Gates&rsquo;s behavior turns out to be, when we look at the pressure put upon black athletes and entertainers to behave respectfully, so they might be role models to the young. Yet here is this highly touted, prestigious Harvard Professor, who expels coarse vulgarities to a police officer, even spewing out the &#8220;Yo&rsquo; Mama&#8221; insult, like a common street thug, carrying on like the proverbial &#8220;Crazy Nigger.&#8221; Are we to believe that such behavior is not characteristic of this black V.I.P., this Distinguished Scholar?</p>
<p>Constructive Feedback asks just when will blacks feel they have enough societal control that they can move on and finally deal with the pressing realities that &#8220;are actually killing African-Americans.&#8221; The answer to his question was given long ago.</p>
<p>Black elites, those who have always had the power and the resources to ameliorate much of the suffering within the black community, made it clear from as early as the 19th century that their interests will always rest outside the group, even as they exploit the theme of &#8220;race&#8221; to personally elevate themselves. You need look no further than Henry Louis Gates and the entire entourage of professionals and academics, who covet white society&rsquo;s credentials in their striving to be socially acceptable. Some of the earliest observations and commentaries by both blacks and whites about the American Negro personality still hold up (see especially Harold Cruse).</p>
<p>Yet, even in these venues among whites that they have chosen, these elites remain in a combative stance, always pushing the envelope in a need to prove who they are. They have no more concern today about the genuine needs of the black masses than did their fathers and grandfathers. And, if given the chance, these elites would just as eagerly oppose Booker T. Washington for his temerity in insisting on putting the welfare of the masses first. So, the answer to the rhetorical question as to when blacks will move on and deal with the real stuff is, Never.<br/>

<p>There are two people.  They are both men in their twenties.  Both have an IQ of 95.  One is white, the other is black.  Who&rsquo;s going to have more opportunities?  I&rsquo;m sure the white one would love to walk in the black one&rsquo;s shoes.</p>

		<p>The ones who are really suffering racism in this country today are WHITES. Far too many blacks lie and continue to be on the gravy train by instilling &#8220;guilt&#8221; onto the White race. How else are they going to get their &#8220;reparations&#8221; and quotas and affirmative action if they admit they do not suffer from any White &#8220;racism&#8221;. I have never felt any guilt whatsoever for any black or other minority. They are the ones who need to feel alot of guilt and remorse for what they have done, not us.  </p>

		<p>Blacks have made this society dysfunctional in so many ways it&rsquo;s hard to keep track of.  Their lying cries of racism and struggle and suffering are hogwash.  Bolstering them are the mindless brainwashed whites who are so naive and stupid they&rsquo;re probably more worthless than even the blacks.</p>
<p>How great it would be to have several all-white communities in the wilds of Idaho, consisting of several towns with hospitals and other necessities that make the entire area self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Everyone would be required to watch documentaries of the failure of multiculturalism and be learned in the subject of how the scam artists have taken control of America.  All children would be community or home schooled with volunteer teachers or parents themselves.</p>
<p>Being apart from this madness and watching from afar would be quite entertaining indeed.  People living in such a situation could avoid the economic collapses and the black and other non-white pathologies.</p>
<p>Someone will probably say that such an environment wouldn&rsquo;t work because the multicults wouldn&rsquo;t allow it, so to them I would say, yes it could work, because the remoteness of Idaho is someplace these spineless types would never ever care to venture to nor would they care if it existed.</p>
<p>Besides they&rsquo;ll be too weak to do much for the next 50 years.  And, during the next ten years it is entirely possible they will lose most of the United States and will be confined to areas that will evolve into squabbling and fighting for years to come.</p>
<p>Certainly such a situation would send many non-whites back home, hopefully taking these disgusting white diversity cult members with them.</p>

<p>Probably they do it (and so do most whites) just as Elizabeth Wright says, to advance their own interests or even to make themselves feel better (which rests upon making someone else feel worse) as they revel in their imagined superiority, however, some of the minority elite do it as a kind of empathy with the underclass. At least that&rsquo;s their excuse. I&rsquo;ve been arguing this for a long time, right or wrong, liberal values have truimphed simply because holding these &#8216;values&rsquo; is the easiest way to hurt other people.  </p>

		<p>The Black Elite Class has to be one of the most perplexing group&rsquo;s in this country. They can have great education&rsquo;s, important job&rsquo;s, excellent incomes, and most important of all the approval and acceptance of The White Elite Class, but they will still whine and moan about perceived racism when something doesn&rsquo;t go their way. But the biggest perplexity is that they will, like any sane White avoid contact with non elite black&rsquo;s, but will rush to their defense at the first sign of a White voicing even the slighest disapproval of the anti-social behavior of the great majority of black&rsquo;s.</p>

I&rsquo;ve written here previously that I am slighted, ignored, and treated rudely by white people throughout the course of the day. I take these minor indignities for what they are; strangers busy living their own lives. When they happen to blacks, they become self-evident racism.</p>
<p>What people refer to as &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is the fact that whites commit fewer crimes and, in public, act more civilized and respectful of people around them. If whites acted as badly as many blacks do, whites would have this &#8220;privilege&#8221; taken away by means of dealing with authorities and public scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skip&#8221; was ticked off that some uppity white boy didn&rsquo;t know he was THE preeminent &#8216;black scholar&rsquo; (a title bestowed upon him by whites in a white society in a white university. Would &#8220;Skip&#8221; ever have achieved such a position in say Haiti or Uganda?). </p>
<p>Being around whites, blacks are naturally aware of their tenuous status. What the black man has achieved in the white mans&rsquo; world is what the white man have given him. When a black man in a black world can create what the white man has achieved independently of the white man, then I&rsquo;ll take note of the black mans&rsquo; achievements.<br/>

		<p>       These hyper-sensitive Elite Blacks still feel inferior to White Men. It&rsquo;s almost like they know that they their postion is unreal and unearned. That they are and always will be outsiders among us. One always hates those whom one has wronged. They have gotten over on us by trickery and politics. They feel guilt and therefore, hate.</p>

		<p>I love Elizabeth Wright.  She wrote an excellent and highly lauditory review last year of Craig Bodeker&rsquo;s film &#8220;A Conversation About Race.&#8221;  She is essentially the polar opposite of Tim Wise. Tim Wise being a white who seems to despise whites and takes every opportunity to validate black feelings of victimization, while Elizabeth Wright is a female black conservative who takes every opportunity to expose the anti-white double standards in our society, ridiculousnous of black victimization ideology, and performs literary slaps to the face of idiotic white liberals like former NY mayor Koch and the usual hollywood types.  The importance of pundits like Elizabeth <br/>
Wright is obvious - no one can respond to her with the usual &#8220;you can&rsquo;t say anything about the subject because you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be black!&#8221;  Although they usually have the well known standard and brainless response ready for people like her - Uncle Tom.</p>

		<p>I want somebody to create a documentary called &#8220;white privilege&#8221; where a white man enters businesses looking for work.  When his work request is not immediately answered in the affirmative, he responds by invoking &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.  When he wishes to purchase something in a store, let him invoke &#8220;white privilege&#8221; in order to get a better price.  While asking women out on dates, he&rsquo;d invoke &#8220;white privilege&#8221; to get a &#8220;yes&#8221; answer. And so on and so forth.  In the end, of course, it will become obvious that there is no &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.  This video would be very entertaining.  Bodeker, if you&rsquo;re reading this, please consider!</p>

		<p>Elizabeth Wright has always demonstrated courage in her writing.<br/>
She points out the ridiculousness of the attitudes of so many blacks today.<br/>
When a person feels persecuted by society, while at the same time feeling SUPERIOR to most members of that society, he is, or soon will become, psychopathic!<br/>
Do many blacks today consider themselves superior?<br/>
You betcha!<br/>
Now that our nation celebrates all things black; like sports that favor blacks over whites, and &#8220;rapping&#8221;,  is it any wonder that so many young blacks today will actually laugh in the faces of whites and others, for our civility and discipline&hellip;?<br/>
Our Governmedia has created this new generation of blacks.  They are angry, hateful , and ARMED by a Constitution they can neither comprehend or live-up to.</p>

		<p>We are seeing the end of the era which began to solve actual legal barriers to black people having opportunity.  As there are more and more people clamoring to be supported by the productivity of white society, and the economy gets worse, there will be a paradigm shift in the USA.  Eventually the remaining white majority will tire of the demands and start to act in a similar tribal fashion.  I see programs to support minority businesses.  Hispanics want to support their community and do business with other hispanic owned firms through a hispanic chamber of commerce.  At some point the whites will realize that they have to stick together to hold on to what they have from being taken by groups that survive on subsidies paid directly and indirectly by the whites who have been quiet and taken the abuse for decades.  There is a silent majority that sees the problems, but that needs a leader to bring the discontent to an effective political force.  That force will get rid of the diversity apparatus which is only really championed by a generation of whites who are now at the peak of their power.  That generation is blind to what we younger people have seen that diversity is a sham.  The only valid goal is equality of opportunity.  That equality is now denied to the white tribe by many forces which are on their last legs as we get deeper into the Great Recession every day.</p>

		<p>After reading the comments of Ice, I said wow, I have been thinking of that very same thing, but did not know how to put it into words.  I seem to remember that years ago, groups such as the Quakers, Amish and others formed separate exclusive communities based upon thier religous beliefs.  Why not do the same thing for like minded individuals today?  What Ice proposes makes sense to me.  </p>

<p>The best argument against &#8220;racism&#8221; in the US is that blacks choose to remain &amp; live here.  Even the poor ones could return to Africa, if they really wanted to.  Whenever they start to whine, gently mention returning to the paradise of a white-free Africa, &amp; see how angry they get.  It&rsquo;s pure comedy. </p>

<p>The White Privilege documentary should be made w/a companion film called Black Suffering.</p>
<p>Since most black and white liberals claim that blacks are subjected to hate and discrimination every day of their lives, let&rsquo;s call their bluff and film some blacks over a 24 hour period to document the imaginary &#8220;oppression&#8221; they suffer under. </p>
