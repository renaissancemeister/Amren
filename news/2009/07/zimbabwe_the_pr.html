<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8176049.stm">Zimbabwe: The Price of Reconciliation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Harding, BBC News, July 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As Zimbabwe launches a debate about &#8220;national healing&#8221; after years of political violence, the country&rsquo;s prime minister has told the BBC that those found responsible for a wave of killings and torture should &#8220;not necessarily&#8221; be sent to jail.</p>
<p>At the same time, some victims have expressed concern they will never see justice or compensation.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai was speaking in Harare where the new unity government has just unveiled an &#8220;Organ for National Healing, Reconciliation and Integration&#8221; or ONHRI.</p>
<p>Mr Tsvangirai, who has himself been severely beaten by members of President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s security forces, stressed that he was &#8220;not just saying  &mdash;  forgive, heal and reconcile&#8221;.</p>
<p>But he said &#8220;justice needs forgiveness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and if we do retributive justice, the danger is that we may slide back&#8221; towards violence.</p>
<p><b>What reconciliation?</b></p>
<p>John Nkomo, a senior figure in Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s Zanu-PF, and chairman of ONHRI, said that &#8220;anyone who has broken the law should be put on trial&#8221;.</p>
<p>But he also argued against a rush to judgment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, people were killed; yes, people fight; yes, they may still be fighting, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this nation is going through a process and these tensions, unless properly managed, could create more tensions for us and we don&rsquo;t want that.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of this seems likely to reassure Emmanuel Chiroto.</p>
<p>One year ago, a group of Zanu-PF militia abducted his wife, Abigail, from their home on the edge of Harare.</p>
<p>Mr Chiroto, an MDC activist, had just been elected the city&rsquo;s deputy mayor. His wife&rsquo;s badly beaten body was found on a roadside soon afterwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve got the names of six people responsible,&#8221; said Mr Chiroto, wandering round the ruins of his home, which was firebombed during the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;They live round here. I see them often. But none of them have even been picked up for questioning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week he says he received two threatening phone calls from a male voice saying: &#8220;You&rsquo;re forgetting what happened to your wife. Our intention was to kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re told things are changing,&#8221; Mr Chiroto said. &#8220;The unity government is in place. But personally I find it very difficult to forgive people who are still boasting about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another MDC activist, Josphat Chidindi, was attacked with an axe on 25 June this year by two men who, he says, were the same Zanu-PF militants who had nearly killed him a year earlier.</p>
<p>His right arm was nearly severed and remains heavily bandaged.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wanted to silence me at all costs,&#8221; he said, dismissing talk of reconciliation in Zimbabwe as &#8220;nonsense&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want these men to face trial, but I don&rsquo;t think justice will be done as long as Zanu-PF is part of this inclusive government.&nbsp;.&nsbp;.&nbsp;. There is no future to talk about,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Many human rights activists also appear to be sceptical about ONHRI&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Maria Mache, from the Crisis Coalition, dismissed it as &#8220;a farce&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want the perpetrators of violence, those who abducted others, who did so many atrocities in Zimbabwe to be brought to book. We can&rsquo;t talk about reconciliation until there has been transitional justice,&#8221; she said.<br>

		<p>Of course forgiveness is the first step in reconciliation.</p>
<p>I mean the offenses were just tortures and murders.  In Africa that&rsquo;s more like standard operating procedure than infractions of anybody&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>See how prosperous and civil they are once the white man is no longer in control?</p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s betterthan New Orleans and Detroit.</p>

		<p>What never amazes me, after reading about the mistreatment of Whites   &mdash;   attacks, killings, thefts of land and property&hellip; WHY did the Whites REMAIN after the government was taken over by Blacks? Even a rank idiot could see that Whites would be victimized by the Blacks. Better to have burned your houses, destroyed everything you can and fled to South Africa, then to Europe. </p>
<p>If the Mexicans/Hispanics ever gain complete power in this country, is anyone stupid enough to think a White minority could or would get fair treatment from a then-Hispanic government? Would you like to buy a magnificent New York bridge from me? I&rsquo;ll make you a fanstastic deal on it.</p>

		<p>I guess this definitively disproves all you AMRENers who say Africans can&rsquo;t plan ahead huh? </p>
<p>The Mugabe goons see the winds of change a blowin so they declare it time for &#8220;National Reconciliation&#8221;, which as far as I can tell, means, forgiving the tyrants who have been killing you for years, because they have a gun to your head and you have no other choice. Then when they fall they can point to the &#8220;national reconcilation&#8221; they orchestrated and walk away sccott free.</p>
<p>Reminds me a little of the Tookie Williams execution. You can&rsquo;t execute tookie, just because he created a gang which murdered thousands of people, he wrote a children&rsquo;s book for at risk youths! Africans hate having to be punished for their crimes.</p>

		<p>Easy to talk Fed Up,</p>
<p>If the whites of Zimbabwe ran to South Africa and stayed, they would eventually go through the same as in Zimbabwe. Because what they went through will eventually become the fate of whites in South Africa as well. So they have to keep on running North to the at this stage still European governed countries.</p>
<p>Fed UP quoted:<br>
&#8220;Even a rank idiot could see that Whites would be victimized by the Blacks. Better to have burned your houses, destroyed everything you can and fled to South Africa, then to Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all the whites in South Africa have destroyed their property, which &#8220;white&#8221; country would open their doors to +- 4,5 million white refugees?</p>
<p>Is it not true that your white governments wil only open the doors to safety for only the very rich and those with the few attributes that you have a shortage of?</p>
<p>Is it not true that white governments the world over would rather allow a massive genocide against us than to be portrayed as racists for saving masses of whites?</p>

<p>Morgan Tsvangirai is to Zimbabwe as Arnold Schwarzenegger is to the state of California. Both ran on a platform of cleaning up the mess in their respective governments, and both were corrupted by the putrid stench from their respective colleagues once they were seated. The difference is one of degree, not kind.</p>

		<p>Let me interpret&hellip;.as always when Blacks say&hellip;lets&rsquo; come together..or..lets talk or..can&rsquo;t we all just get along. It means Whites need to admit guilt,shutup(except to apologize) and give us something.<br>
Zimbabwe is starving please come back and raise food on land that we own and control. Then when you fed us for a while we will start to kill you again (because we forgot we cannot do without you).<br>
Of course some Whites will come back while the Blacks sicker at them. Then when they attack again those same Whites will cry &#8220;why are you doing this&#8221; in their death throes.    <br>
Maybe Darwin was right and Whites just do not have survival instincts to handle multiculturalism&hellip;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe Darwin was right and Whites just do not have survival instincts to handle multiculturalism&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would submit that the arrangement caused by multiculturalism is not natural and therefore outside of Darwin&rsquo;s model for the survival or the strong or most intelligent - at least in the way you portray it.  If one is to overwhelm a breed, or family, or &#8220;race&#8221; - as we would most want to put it - some traits of that family may survive in a diluted form, but the collection of traits that made that particular family appear with its particular traits, in other words - its specialness or unique, remarkable qualities are lost.  Even if a refinement occurs sometime in the future, that which emerges will not likely be very much like the one that was lost because other variables such as location, weather and the amount and duration of isolation from other groups (required to produce a specific family or &#8220;breed&#8221;) would be different than in the past.  This is why preserving what we can now is so important.  You&rsquo;d think liberals would want to preserve the remarkable &#8220;redhead&#8221; group, wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>

		<p>Question Diversity: Yeah, I know the Tookie reform thing was a farce, he never renounced his membership in the Crips even when &#8220;Speaking out&#8221; against gang violence. Can you imagine an Italian saying something like &#8220;I renounce organized crime, but I refuse to step down as Kingpin of my crime family which has killed thousands of people because you are just trying to humiliate me! Oh and now that I have reformed please release me!&#8221; </p>
<p>Yet that was Tookie&rsquo;s exact argument and the liberal establishment swooned over him.</p>
<p>The point I was making was Africans always pout, howl, and squeal when they are punished for their crimes. How often do you see some sob story on the news about a &#8220;good boy&#8221; who just made &#8220;one little mistake&#8221; (typically involving violent homicide) who &#8220;isn&rsquo;t that person anymore&#8221; begging to be let free so his big fat wailing mama can have her little boy back?  </p>
<p>They demand instant forgiveness for their own misdeeds like say genoiciding rival tribes in Africa or killing store clerks in botched robberies in Oakland, but of course when it comes to things whites did like 150 years ago which have  since been atoned for dozens of times over, the rallying cry is always never forget!</p>

		<p>In Africa, they speak of &#8220;reconciliation&#8221; and I wonder if any native black African languages even have such a word in their vocabulary&hellip;  In America, black always speak of &#8220;hope&#8221; because hope is only a feeling inside that does not necessitate any kind of action or change of behavior.  I&rsquo;m wondering (again) if any native black African languages even have a word for &#8220;hope&#8221; in the abstract sense that whites often mean when they say that word.  In other words, both &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;reconciliation&#8221; might be white concepts - in their most abstract sense.</p>

		<p>Afros always want to commit their atrocities and then call for reconciliation instead of facing the consequences of their actions.<br>
After the brutal torture, gang rape and murder of Melissa McLaughlin in Charleston come years ago, Black City Officials tried to cover up the fact that anti-white &#8220;literature&#8221; was found in the trailer of the beasts. One said that it would only set back race relations or something to the effect.  A Black Councilman called for &#8220;healing&#8221;. That word has become a smoke screen. We&rsquo;ve gone beyond the point of healing. Racial harmony will never be a reality when one side is completely irrational and incapable of any type of logical reasoning. Just listening to the bizarre pronouncements of many of their high profile leaders is more than enough evidence and these are the people to whom the rest of them listen.</p>
<p>I fear that Civil War Part 2 is coming very soon.</p>
