			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP / Expatica, July 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>French youths burned 317 cars and wounded 13 police officers overnight during the now traditional bout of street violence on the eve of the Bastille Day national holiday, police said Tuesday.</p>
<p>As French troops and their guests of honour from the Indian army made last minute preparations for the14 July parade on the Champs Elysees in Paris, the suburbs of major cities were contemplating another clean-up operation.</p>
<p>By 6:00 am (0400 GMT), police headquarters in Paris had recorded 317 burnt out cars  &mdash;  up 6.7 percent on 2008  &mdash;  and 240 arrests, almost double the total for the same period last year.</p>
<p>These numbers were expected to increase as fresh reports came in.</p>
<p>The injured officers, 12 members of the police and one gendarme, were mainly suffering from hearing difficulties after being targeted by youths throwing fireworks and small-scale home-made explosives.</p>
<p>France marks Bastille Day as the anniversary of 14 July 1789, when a revolutionary mob stormed the Parisian prison and set in motion the events that would lead to the overthrow of the monarchy.</p>
<p>Today, disaffected youths from bleak suburban housing projects around major cities use it to express their frustration with high unemployment rates and what they see as France&rsquo;s failure to integrate ethnic minorities.<br>

<p>Yes, and look what good it did?</p>
<p>They had an out-of-touch monarchy, very much like the out of touch French Parliament and U.S. Congress today, who thought of themselves as elitists and the rest just plain rabble to be used and abused.  </p>
<p>But, now, added to that form of misery, the out of touch government bodies have burdened their citizens with imported foreign white-haters who despise them and want complete control of both countries, people who caused a sub-prime crash that put a serious hole in the public treasury, which is emptying quickly.</p>
<p>Does it look like, to anybody else besides me, that the situation in both the US and France might just be &#8220;on the brink,&#8221; if we were to put it delicately?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m expecting the brilliant multicults to say anyday now to, &#8220;Let them eat cake.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>These disaffected &#8220;youth&#8221; aren&rsquo;t in France to work anyway, so who is printing these lies in the first place? </p>
<p> Oops, the French media is just like the good ole USA media?  Excuse making seems to be the same in all White nations for these &#8220;ethnic minorities&#8221;..There is only one way to stop it and that is spelled deportation.</p>

<p>What the French Revolution got the French was after the overthrow of the monarchy, it got them about a decade or so of chaos, and then the head case Corsican Napoleon Bonaparte as a military dictator.  Napoleon&rsquo;s megalomaniac attitude meant that the most virile of the French gene pool was left to die on the Russian steppes&rsquo;s harsh winters.</p>
<p>This is my response to Pierce/NA types who want things to go to hell and then for some right wing phoenix type savior in shining armor riding on a white horse to come along to save us all.  When you play with fire, the winds just might not blow in the direction you want them to.</p>

<p>These &#8216;youths&rsquo; take any opportunity to riot because that&rsquo;s what they do, riot. They wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to spell ethnic minorities or have a clue what Bastille day was all about and the fact that they destroy their OWN neighbourhoods just goes even further to show what oxygen theives they really are.<br>

		<p>These are practice runs.  They are gearing up for another French Revolution.  Only this time it won&rsquo;t be so &#8220;French&#8221;.  But it is coming. All  the signs are there;  all the writing is on the wall. Sooner or later, one of these incidents will get out of control and become a conflagration. That is the way history works.</p>

		<p>Thanks to Anon. for that  article from the BNP.   I found this quote particularly hilarious  (and typically French):</p>
<p> &#8220;French Minister of Education Gilles de Robien announced he had developed a plan to stop the non-white riots by &ldquo;improving grammar teaching in French schools.&rdquo;  [His] proposal put grammar  [ahead of] reading, mathematics or science. In a famous speech, he insisted that only by learning the parts of speech and the function of words within a sentence can human beings make sense of the universe, take control of nature, and impose our intelligence on the world.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m an Englishman living in France and saw two sides to Bastille Day. </p>
<p>Both were illuminating.</p>
<p>First, the French celebrated with their traditional fireworks displays. Every village and town held a &#8220;Feu d&rsquo;artifice&#8221; - our village closed off the streets around the Marie/Church and we had beer, food and a brilliant, free, display.</p>
<p>I watched, entranced, as the Bastille parade passed off in Paris.</p>
<p>I was entranced because it was a full scale military pageant. French cavalry, infantry, military vehicles, flypasts. There were German, Indian and even British troops proudly marching by. Armed police marched as did, surprisingly, armed firemen. The garden party was broadcast and Carla Bruni was interviewed and gave a tour of the Elysee Palace.</p>
<p>I actually felt proud despite being English. You could see the politicians were delighted and proud to be French.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t that happen in the UK? Where is our annual patriotic display?</p>
<p>Secondly, the rioters were shown. They were getting a good kicking and no sympathy. The French are under no illusion about the problems they have with immigrants but even the Left in France insists on integration, not multiculturalism - being French and Republican is non-negotiable. Also, France is 4 times the size of England with the same population. Immigrants are confined to ghettos and tend to trash their own areas. The population is armed, the police armed and communities stick together.</p>
<p>That is why I like France. They will defend their culture - not give it away as is happening in the UK.</p>

		<p>It is very interesting to see the way the French political establishment deliberately censors, downplays and denies stories involving racial dischord.<br>
  I remember a few years back a story concerning armed robbbers attacking passengers on a train (the robbers were of north African origin), was very effectively suppressed by The French establishment.<br>
  I suspect that there is greater casndor and press freedom in modern China.</p>

		<p>While France has recently gone down affirmative action route, it&rsquo;s official policy for years was to pretend that race, ethnicity, religion, etc. didn&rsquo;t exist, that everyone was just a citizen with no differences between them.  You see how well that worked out.  What makes it interesting is that France&rsquo;s former failed policy is now the official position of Republicans/Conservatives in this country.   They&rsquo;re constantly whining about &#8220;hyphenated Americans.&#8221;   Becoming a hated minority in your own country is an earthquake that shatters everything and no PR campaign or government policy or word manipulation will stop the destruction.  </p>

In fact, not resisting such aggression is highly desirable, because it shows to the world how non-racist and understanding you are.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
I predict that if the conflagration starts in France  (or elsewhere) and gets out of hand, it will quickly spread to Germany, Belgium, Sweden, etc.    All Europe will be ablaze.</p>
<p>This is probably what the EU government is terrified of   &mdash;   if it can even conceive of such a possibility.     </p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m sure that many of the doctrinaire socialists running Europe cannot even imagine such a thing.  Talk about &#8216;cognitive dissonance&rsquo;!   It will be,  for them,  a tremendous shock.   According to the Marxist textbook, it&rsquo;s not supposed to work that way!   These exotic races are supposed to be assimilating into good &#8220;Frenchmen&#8221;,  good &#8220;Europeans&#8221;.  They are supposed to respect and preserve European culture (even while replacing the European nations).   What could possibly have gone wrong?  Certainly race could have nothing to do with it;  that&rsquo;s a forbidden thought!)</p>

<p>Oh, those poor &#8220;disaffected youths&#8221;!  How sad.<br>
    <br>
You should see some of those &#8220;bleak suburban housing projects&#8221;.   These are  (originally) attractive garden communities, all new construction, spacious, airy, away from congested urban slums   &mdash;   built at considerable government expense. They would be very pleasant places, except for the unruly populations who reside there.  [One must bear in mind that these are people who come from villages in Africa where garbage collection and indoor toilets are unknown. People who use their bathtubs to slaughter chickens and sheep.]   If these places are indeed &#8220;bleak&#8221;, that is only because of the people who live in them and who have made them that way.   </p>

<p>Mr. de Robien should try Midnight basketball.  That seemed to work well in the USA.  It would also help if they named several French holidays after famous Africans, and also elected an illegal African immigrant as President.  But if they really want to solve the problem, the racist French need to simply move out of that country   &mdash;   go somewhere else, thereby finally setting free from White racism the repressed and suffering Africans (the same way that all of Africa is finally free of whites.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m American.  I went to Paris last year expecting to dislike the &#8220;snobby&#8221; French.  Instead, I came to respect their patriotism and self-respect.  They are not afraid to say they think their culture is superior, and they don&rsquo;t automatically apologize for everything, like Americans do.  Also, I noticed they don&rsquo;t worry about &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; nonsense and station police at highway tollbooths to look into the cars and pull over anyone who &#8220;looks foreign&#8221; for an id check.  I wish more Americans were as proud of their culture as the French are.</p>

<p>To clarify something:   Not to disagree with you, but there would be very few if any &#8220;Asians&#8221; among them    &mdash;   neither of the kind normally meant in the British Isles (Indian sub-continentals), nor of the kind understood in America (Far Eastern Orientals).</p>
<p>Virtually ALL of them are Africans, whether black Africans or North Africans&hellip;  Very different types, but both African.</p>
<p>Btw, there ARE Chinese, Vietnamese, etc. in France   &mdash;    but  (just as here) they&rsquo; are law-abiding, industrious, and they don&rsquo;t riot.   Interesting to observe the difference!</p>

<p>Very true.  I have a friend who knows a woman, very liberal,  whose two daughters were both raped   &mdash;   by blacks.  Yet, she continues to support blacks and black causes,  continues making apologies for them, and dismissing those incidents as just freakish anomalies with no meaning.</p>
<p>If you were to present her with clear statistics proving that these were anything but freakish anomalies, you would draw her wrath upon you!   Why?  Because    &mdash;    for her, and for people like her   &mdash;   you would be putting her in a corner where she would be forced to re-evaluate all her opinions, all her life&rsquo;s commitments,  her whole mental framework, her world view.   She would have to admit that most of her life she had been terribly wrong.   That&rsquo;s a very heavy load  for anyone to handle,  and many people just can&rsquo;t manage it. </p>

<p>Does it look like, to anybody else besides me, that the situation in both the US and France might just be &ldquo;on the brink,&rdquo; if we were to put it delicately?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m expecting the brilliant multicults to say anyday now to, &ldquo;Let them eat cake.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&gt; This is a great example of the path to eroneous conclusions made from historic cliche&rsquo; and generalizing.  The FACT is that Louis XVl broke the French bank supporting the Americans in their War of Independence.  The impoverishment of the country due to that led to starvation and the uprising, not a fuzzy notion that the royals were out of touch with their people.  Louis XVl was aware of the problems but could do little about it in time.  The popular notions of an &#8220;out of touch&#8221; monarchy is mostly hype built on republican/revolutionary criticism of the time and has been enlarged upon by sloganizing of ignorants who wish to sound informed.  But they aren&rsquo;t - they aren&rsquo;t serious students of history and the philosohy of the historian.  If you really want to comment about the French Revolution, why not comment on the uselessness of it and the horrit bloodbath it provoked - along with the projection of those excesses to today&rsquo;s useless and harmful tradition of striking and rioting over anything.  So the immigrants have caught on - no surprise.  The notion in France is that if you &#8220;Storm the Bastille,&#8221; you&rsquo;ll get things done.  And if that isn&rsquo;t enough, you could focus on Napoleon, who military madness actually brought a near WWl catastrophe to Europe in terms of destruction and especially the number of dead during his fifteen years of bloody &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; campaigns.  It ought to be remembered that yes, Marie Antoinette said, &#8220;Let them eat cake,&#8221; NOT &#8220;Let them eat beans (or merde).&#8221;</p>

  &mdash;  Whiteplight<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Whiteplight gave a good, and accurate, summation of the French Revolution   &mdash;   though it would difficult to put it all in a tome, much less a paragraph.   </p>
<p>Incidentally, Marie Antoinette never really said any such thing (&#8220;Let them eat cake&#8221;).  She was actually quite a kind person, as was her husband Louis [facing his death, he was worried mainly about how his servants would survive and support their families]&hellip; but they were both in much deeper water than they could navigate, both of them being victims of positions that they had been born into and through no fault of their own. She was particularly a victim of a vicious gossip campaign. Being Austrian and a Hapsburg  (whom the French had hated and fought for centuries), she was despised from the first day she set foot in France. Everything was against her. She was surrounded by manipulators and connivers who sought her downfall amidst a swirl of jealousy and conspiracy.  And they ultimately got their wishes!   But, ironically, most of them got their turn at the guillotine too,  in the long run.  As with most such revolutions, they get out of control once the blood starts flowing, and then it&rsquo;s unstoppable. The revolution turns and consumes its own. </p>
<p>The French Revolution seems to have been mostly an urban thing, a radical Parisian thing, a creation of the Parisian mobs and their leftist manipulators.  It still is!   </p>
<p>The article didn&rsquo;t mention it, but there are rural parts of France where the Revolution and  July 14th are NOT celebrated (eg. Brittany, and the Vendée region in western France).   These  conservative, religious, areas which remained loyal to the crown suffered such terrible massacres that the Revolution has left a bitter memory which lingers to this day.   Revolutionary troops  &#8220;were ordered to kill everyone and everything they saw.&#8221;   Around Nantes alone,  170,000 people were massacred.  Although the massacres are excluded from French history books,  Lenin studied this matter carefully and drew inspiration for his policies.  The people of the ancient province of Vendée are now petitioning to have this declared a genocide.  The authorities in Paris are not pleased.</p>
<p>Here is a chilling example. Read about it! You will see there were two sides to the Revolution. And the French are still fighting it today.   (Btw, it is interesting to note that LePen himself is from the province of Brittany.)https://tinyurl.com/a3ml53</p>
<p>And what did  all  this bloodshed bring about?   They got rid of  a king and replaced him with an emperor!  (Napoleon) &hellip; and after the bloody Napoleonic Wars    &mdash;    which had all of Europe in turmoil and were indeed the first &#8220;world wars&#8221;   &mdash;    within 30 years they were back to a Bourbon king again.  Right where they started!   (Plus ça change, plus c&rsquo;est la même chose.)</p>

<p>    Is this really true? Can French civilians own guns? As someone of Southern French descent, I would really like to know. I love French art and culture but despair over their multicultural future.</p>

		<p>The French interior ministry has issued orders to the prefects not to communicate to the media the crime statistics for the nights of July 13-15. There is an article about this in LE MONDE. Plesae check out the BRUSSELLS JOURNAL for more on this. I guess the French government thinks if people don&rsquo;t hear about it then it never happened.</p>

<p>Here is a British account of another case of <i>&#8220;rioting youths&#8221;. </i> Three days of mayhem (NOT connected with Bastille Day, but prior to it) in Ferminy, a small city of 19,000 (in South central France, near Lyon) which they allegedly burned to the ground. </p>
<p>(Note for American readers: &#8220;suburban  estates&#8221; are BritSpeak for what we would call housing projects.)</p>
