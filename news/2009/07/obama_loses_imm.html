<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/30/obama-loses-immigration-allies/">Obama Loses Immigration Allies</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, July 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three years after President Obama marched alongside Hispanic and immigrant rights activists, they took to the streets Wednesday to march against him, saying he has betrayed them by embracing George W. Bush administration efforts to stem illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Activists marched in Los Angeles and picketed Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano&rsquo;s appearance in New York, angered over the administration&rsquo;s recent embrace of an electronic verification system for employers and a program that allows local police to enforce immigration laws.</p>
<p>The protests highlight the tough political spot Mr. Obama faces: He enjoyed strong support from Hispanics in last year&rsquo;s election, but activists say he&rsquo;s now risking their support in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the sense of betrayal creeping up,&#8221; said Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, which organized the protest against Ms. Napolitano.</p>
<p>The coalition said the administration is using the right words on immigrant rights but taking the wrong actions to boost enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking in New York to the Council on Foreign Relations, Ms. Napolitano defended the White House&rsquo;s decision to move forward with a crackdown on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are expanding enforcement, but I think in the right way,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In particular, she defended the local police enforcement program  &mdash;  known as 287(g) because of the section of law that authorizes it  &mdash;  saying it was created by the Clinton administration but went astray. She said the Obama administration has taken steps to add accountability and protections to the program and to push local police to focus on dangerous criminal illegals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Hong said the Obama administration is using all the right words about backing a broad immigration bill but is taking &#8220;massive enforcement actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also said stepping up enforcement of &#8220;dysfunctional and unenforceable&#8221; laws is not a solution, and said the activists hope to push Mr. Obama away from enforcement and back toward his campaign promises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today was the one event that we didn&rsquo;t want to have,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t want to be protesting President Obama&rsquo;s immigration policy and Napolitano&rsquo;s policy, it really pains us to be picketing.&#8221;</p>
<p>One immigrant rights group said it expects Democratic senators to introduce legislation this week rolling back some of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s new enforcement plans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Ms. Hong and other activists blasted the move, saying that if Mr. Obama continues to pile up enforcement without any action on legalization it will cost him politically.</p>

		<p>How&rsquo;s this for gall.  These mestizo criminals demand to be rewarded for breaking the law.</p>
<p>Anybody that hires them should be boycotted.  In this falling economic climate just a few people anymore have the ability to destroy a business by refusing to patronize it.</p>
<p>If the MSM really did their jobs, they would be printing stories revealing the huge number of blacks that have been displaced by illegal aliens.</p>
<p>But the blacks aren&rsquo;t complaining either.</p>
<p>But, if they don&rsquo;t mind, I don&rsquo;t mind.  Lets just let it all play out and see who starves first, blacks or mestizos.  It should be interesting to watch all the prepatory skirmishes all the way up to total conflict. </p>
<p>Neither group is aware enough to understand the situation, and I have no doubt they don&rsquo;t have that first clue about how serious things are right now.</p>

Typical hispanic. They suck up to you like they&rsquo;re your greatest friend. When you don&rsquo;t give them what you want, they turn and slit your throat.</p>
<p>Read the letters to the editor in your newspaper and you can see the pattern. At first the writer appeals to your better nature. In the last paragraph is always a veiled, if not open, threat to get even if they don&rsquo;t get what they want.</p>
<p>Right now, the only thing holding back the hordes is the economy. It would be political suicide for anyone to give millions of illegals access to American jobs.</p>
<p>When the economy recovers, look out.<br>

<p>The conduct of Chinese ex-pats around the world is getting progressively pushy. Their diaspora is actively advancing Chinese interests and presence around the globe, in concurrence with the motherland&rsquo;s quest for greater international stature.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual for them to have a less threatening woman as their spokesman, and to cloak their agenda in &#8216;humanitarianism&rsquo;, which they know is a weakness of the West. </p>

		<p>How dare we enforce the laws of this country! What is the matter with us wanting to keep criminals out of our country? After all, Mexico welcomes aliens with open arms, don&rsquo;t they? Since Obama has been dared to ignore the activist&rsquo;s threats, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if he retailiated and sent them all home along with those who support them?</p>

		<p>The US is paying the price for 1965 immigration policies. The neglect of enforcement has brought US to the point where more foreign borns will vote than natives.  The DNC appears to have planned this.  Both parties who took oaths to defend US Constitution have let the country down.  The lack of illegal immigration/entry enforcement is now the most costly destructive social policy of the century. State sponsorship of every baby born to tourist women leaves ever increasing 18 year debts upon the US. It also results in the invasion/colonization of the nation and the replacement of nativeborn heritage for recently arriving UN-Amercian peoples who have no interests in the economic/cultural stability of the nation. All problems are result of illegal immigrants and Congress working together against the Constitution and the American people. There is no rational reason for betraying ones&rsquo; country for foreign interests.  When were elected representatives assigned to represent illegal aliens????Why has DNC nominated a person to the supreme court who supports any foreign ethnic over others.<br>
Why are there more foreign lobbyists paying for influence for illegal alien defenses in language, schools, housing,SBA grants, courts/prisons, etc, etc?   Because attorneys make alot of money for defending lawbreakers.  It is still breaking most basic laws of the land and it is still a crime against USA.       V</p>

		<p>I want all of these illegal lawbreakers out of California. I&rsquo;ve watched these illegals from Mexico destroy parts of Orange County. There are parts of Orange County that look worse than Tijuana.</p>
<p>We have homeless vets begging for money on the street and senior citizens putting off health care as they haven&rsquo;t the money, yet we can continue to pay for WIC, Section 8 housing, foodstamps and AFDC to illegal alien women with their anchor babies.</p>
<p>No amnesty. We need to slam the door shut on immigration for a very long time, if maybe forever. Also slam the door shut on H1 and H2 Visas for Indian workers. American Corporations gobble these people up in order to save the allmighty dollar.</p>
<p>All of this planned, none of this is by accident.</p>

		<p>Enforcement of US immigration laws is extremely disruptive to accumulating the necessary critical mass of mexicans needed to stand up the &#8216;in the not too distant future&rsquo; latino utopian nation of Aztlan.  Although there&rsquo;s never been anything remotely resembling a latino utopia (crime, gangs, drugs, violence, and poverty rule these societies) this one will be different.  Yes Aztlan will prove that latinos are not just  feeding off their white hosts.  </p>
<p>One thing that latinos excel at (and will no doubt do so in Aztlan) is sucessfullly marginalizing blacks. Blacks will not be welcome in Aztlan.  For any blacks that wish to live in the utopia, constant whining about racism that is invisible to the naked eye will not be tolerated, nor will it be given any platform or voice in the Aztlan media.  Actually the racism in this paradise will be nothing but blatant.</p>

		<p>We need politicians who will revoke the 1965 Immigration Act and the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  Both wrecklessly impede on our lives and destroy the Consitution.  Stop all the hate crimes bills.  All crime is hate crime and for them to have special status even during crime boils my blood   Hate crimes bills are the third wave of an organized attempt to completely annihilate us.</p>

		<p>Two big issues are intertwined and if Obama is half as smart as everyone thinks he is - and he seems to be - he must know that: 1. Single payer healthcare is the only solution for endng profiteering from sickness and disease, something as a former doctor, I see as morally wrong no matter how you try to justify it as a capitalist.  2.  The only way a &#8220;Medicare for all&#8221; healthcare system has a chance to work is if the nation in question is not attempting to include every living being that can sneak, trick or manipulate their way into that nation.</p>
<p>These things will become more apparent as the discussion of these issues goes on.  It is just plain dumb to follow lockstep with any particular party line if you intend to arrive at workable solutions.</p>

		<p>Just a reminder here:</p>
<p>First off, the 14th Amendment was never really ratified.</p>
<p>Secondly, even if the 14th were valid, it was never intended for it to be used to grant citizenship to anchor babies.  So anchor babies are NOT American citizens no matter how you slice it.</p>

		<p>Illegal immigration has ruined Southern California.  When I grew up here it was a beautiful place to live.  You could go anywhere, even to Watts, and not fear for your safety.  Today, the illegals have brought us a soaring birth rate, gangs, graffiti, filthy streets, unkept houses, unlimited birth rate for dogs and cats, botanicos where you can buy curses and other dark items, increase in the number of pit bulls, cock fighting, dog fighting (lower class blacks like this too)   &mdash;   all kinds of &#8220;benefits&#8221; we&rsquo;ve gotten from &#8220;diversity,&#8221; all right.  You betcha.  I cannot WAIT to get out of here.  I know, I know, the Mexicans are everywhere - but not in the sheer numbers as in SoCA.  Lucky I can speak Spanish   &mdash;   too bad most of them are too lazy to learn English.  We don&rsquo;t need any more Mexican immigrants.  The ones we have are real busy reproducing more&hellip;..</p>

<p>The 14th was &#8220;ratified,&#8221; but most Southern states that &#8220;ratified&#8221; it did so under the duress of union guns.  There is a basic element of contract law called &#8220;genuineness of assent,&#8221; which means that the parties have to enter the agreement willingly and without external force, for the contract to be good.  </p>
<p>You are right that the constructionism of the part of the 14th that grants citizenship to those born in the country never meant to allow &#8220;anchor babies,&#8221; its purpose was to make recently freed blacks citizens.  It also never intended segregation, because the same U.S. Congress that passed the 14th (remember, that&rsquo;s only the first part of the ratification/amendment process), within a week (?) after doing that, enacted segregated public schools in the District of Columbia.</p>

		<p>We will see what all of the &#8220;enforcement&#8221;is about in the Obama administration. Janet Napolitano does not inspire confidence in anyone, as far as enforcing immigration law. My guess is that a nominal amount of enforcement, will be followed by a big attempt at amnesty.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity:  That&rsquo;s why I said it wasn&rsquo;t really ratified, because of some states being under duress.</p>
<p>Lincoln opposed it and that&rsquo;s a reason why he was assassinated.  Before 1868, you were a citizen of your state FIRST, and an American second.  The 14th Amendment flips it, so you&rsquo;re an American first, resident of your state second, making the states no more than provinces and centralizing power.</p>
