	<p><b>The Women Slept Around Without Any Guilt</b></p>
<p>I developed my racial views from working with black people and teaching them. As a beginning teacher, I realized black students were not used to learning and studying. They ignored homework to the point that I spent less time teaching than trying to get parents to make sure their children handed in their homework. Black parents wanted good grades for their children but would not make them work. They put pressure on principals, superintendents and school board members to attack me as a &#8220;racist&#8221; if their children did not get the grades they thought they deserved.</p>
<p>Just as instructive as the students were black teachers who went to black colleges, none of whom knew their subjects well. The black women, whether married or single, slept around without any guilt. The black men did the same, and many had two or more families. Clothes, not brains, seemed most important to one teacher who had graduated from Fisk University. Her motto was &#8220;dress to impress for success.&#8221; Although she did not understand enough math to prepare her students for the American College Test (ACT), she was held in high regard and was considered a &#8220;role model.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>I Continually Had the &#8216;Aha&rsquo; Feeling</b></p>
<p>I used to be a liberal, then a conventional (<cite>National Review</cite>-Rush Limbaugh) conservative. I grew up like most Americans observing blacks and noticing their behavior, but I attributed it completely to the environment. About four years ago, I read Michael Levin&rsquo;s book <cite><b>Why Race Matters</b></cite> and became converted to the AR position. How did I happen to read this book?</p>
<p>I had been a fan of Prof. Levin since I first came across his article, &#8220;Why Homosexuality Is Abnormal&#8221; in <cite>The Monist</cite>  &mdash;  I believe this was in the late 1980s. As I had always thought homosexuality weird and disgusting, it was nice to find that a very sharp philosopher had actually presented arguments against it. And he did it with such humor and elegance as well. Then, in the early 1990s I found out he had written <cite>Feminism and Freedom,</cite> which I purchased and devoured. Then in the late 1990s, I found out he had written a book on race and I, of course, had to read it so I purchased it.</p>
<p>Professor Levin&rsquo;s book is remarkable. I am an amateur philosopher with an M.A. in the field. Prof. Levin literally teaches you how to think better and to apply philosophical concepts to practical issues like race. As I read through chapter after chapter, I continually had the &#8220;aha&#8221; feeling of finally understanding something that was all too familiar but that my previous conceptual scheme had forced me to misunderstand. Prof. Levin enabled me to see that there was a biological explanation for what I saw.</p>

<p><b>I Never Spoke to a Black Until I Was 23</b></p>
<p>I grew up in idyllic, sylvan, all-white western Pennsylvania. Still, I became racially aware at age 15, in 1976. I think my awareness came from reading healthy material as a child, which countered the onslaught of black-urban television sitcoms. I could not understand why my fellow fifteen-year-olds were attracted to <cite>Good Times</cite>, <cite>What&rsquo;s Happening,</cite> and the blacks who dominate professional sports. My racial awareness can only be attributed to an innate loathing of urban black culture, and its utter alienness.</p>
<p>I had lived in such homogeneous surroundings that I never spoke to a black person until I was 23, and at Penn State. That person was my college adviser, a self-avowed Marxist-Leninist lesbian from Haiti! I explored several groups promoting white racial pride, but was turned off by their low intellectual level.</p>
<p>Today, living in northern Virginia is a daily assault on the senses due to the racial polyglot that is taking over the land of the old Confederacy. To have great pride in one&rsquo;s German-American and Nordic heritage but to see the decline of a once racially healthy America is like battling metastasizing cancer. Also, I felt a great alienation in shouldering these sentiments without the support of &#8220;fellow travelers&#8221; until I found ARand the Council of Conservative Citizens.</p>
<div align="right"><i>Paul H., Alexandria, Virginia</i></div>
<p><b>Freedom &#8216;Unleashed the Beast&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>In my first year of middle school I learned how awfully evil and oppressive white people were  &mdash;  they slaughtered the Indians; they slaughtered the Mexicans; they slaughtered the Jews; they enslaved and discriminated against blacks; they destroyed non-white cultures through colonialism. Needless to say, I left junior high school saddled with white guilt, a strong dislike for my own people, and great sympathy for the plight of blacks and non-whites. I believed that if blacks and non-whites were less successful in our society, it was because of white racism.</p>
<p>My new-found guilt and resentment of my own race grew stronger with each new media account of &#8220;white wickedness&#8221;  &mdash;  past and present  &mdash;  against blacks and non-whites. Every time the TV showed a starving black African face, a white policeman &#8220;brutalizing&#8221; a poor innocent black, or an explicitly graphic account of slavery, Jim Crow or lynching, my guilt and anger toward my own kind grew. It didn&rsquo;t take long before I became an anti-white activist sincerely promoting non-white interests.</p>
<p>What made me see the light? Unlike liberal integrationists who refused to live among the people they championed, I did  &mdash;  and suffered for it. One day, when I was carrying groceries home from the store, a group of black gang members robbed and beat me half to death. After that, in spite of my conventional views on race, whenever I encountered a group of blacks, I increasingly began to think I might be robbed, killed, or forced to fight. I didn&rsquo;t feel this way with whites.</p>
<p>My developing racial consciousness was greatly reinforced the second time blacks jumped and robbed me, and after the third time, I was pretty much convinced that &#8220;past injustices&#8221; and &#8220;discrimination&#8221; were poor excuses for targeting innocent people.</p>
<p>I began to approach the racial literature with an honest desire to discover whether there was any factual or scientific truth to the white racialist point of view. The first thing I learned was that since the end of segregation and legal discrimination, and the implementation of affirmative action and the promotion of black culture through the media and in schools, black crime, poverty, and failure actually increased. Freedom, social and cultural equality, and race-based preferences seem to have &#8220;unleashed the beast.&#8221;</p>
<p>What really convinced me finally to change my mind was the scientific evidence of racial difference, in books like <cite><b>The Bell Curve</b></cite> or in studies like Scarr and Weinberg&rsquo;s Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study. The racial literature also showed me the extreme bias found in the mainstream media, which overplay rare instances of white-on-black crime while virtually ignoring black-on-white crimes, and explained the deliberate distortion of any topic, issue, or fact that doesn&rsquo;t conform to their egalitarian point of view.</p>
<p>It was the combination of experience with non-whites, the study of scientific literature, and increased skepticism toward conventional media accounts of race that led to me to full racial consciousness.</p>

<p><b>I Realized Blacks Don&rsquo;t Want Equality</b></p>
<p>I think living in diverse south Florida made me realize how bad diversity is. I think the incident that led me to white nationalism was the day the O.J. Simpson verdict was announced. I was at my diverse workplace, and we all listened to the trial over the radio. As I heard the verdict I felt afraid. I realized then that blacks don&rsquo;t want equality but dominance and revenge. Soon afterwards I watched an argument between a white liberal homosexual and a black conservative Jamaican over the verdict. The white homosexual argued that O.J. was guilty while the black conservative thought O.J. Simpson would need counseling to get over the trauma of being wrongfully accused of murder. Race overcame all reasoning.</p>

<p><b>One Third of the Employees Were Black</b></p>
<p>While working in a large university library in 1979, I came across a book by N. Weyl and S. Possony entitled <cite><b>The Geography of the Intellect.</b></cite> Reading it confirmed many of my suspicions about race issues, especially with regard to black people. A few years later I began working in a large US Postal facility. Perhaps one third of the 500 employees were black. Working in that environment only confirmed my suspicions and reinforced the information in <cite><b>The Geography of Intellect.</b></cite></p>
<div align="right"><i>Anonymous</i></div>
<p><b>For Me, the Answer Is Easy</b></p>
<p>For me, the answer is easy: Wilmot Robertson&rsquo;s book, <cite><b>The Dispossessed Majority,</b></cite> which I read in 1980. Having read that groundbreaking work, the blindfold was lifted from my eyes, and, for the first time, I began to see the world in racial terms. More importantly, I began to see what was being done to my race.</p>
<p>Like many people, I had accepted the leftist, one-world, all-men-are-brothers concept without question, never suspecting that an anti-white, anti-Christian agenda was shaping my world. Robertson&rsquo;s book, and later Jared Taylor&rsquo;s <cite><b><a href="/store/paved_with_good.html">Paved With Good Intentions,</b></a></cite> showed me how the millions spent on ghetto dwellers were nothing more than a scam, a fraud, and a waste of money. Mr. Robertson opened my eyes to the total media control, which uses films, television, books, newspapers and magazines to spread anti-majority messages. Finally, Wilmot Robertson gave me an immense pride in my race.</p>
<div align="right"><i>One of the Dwindling Canadian Majority, Vancouver, British Columbia</i></div>
<p><b>I Was Unable to Reason With Them</b></p>
<p>For me, the light came slowly. I could not have come from an environment more likely to make me sympathetic to blacks. I am a child of Holocaust survivors, which made me ripe for the rhetoric claiming that blacks fail because of the legacy of slavery and lingering racism. Further, I attended schools with almost no blacks, so there was nothing empirical to contradict the conventional explanation for black failure. Indeed, the president of our high school class was a pleasant, reasonably intelligent African American girl who never played the race card and behaved in a way that would make even AR readers comfortable.</p>
<p>Then I went to college. As a first-generation American from a poor immigrant family, I went to one of the so-called &#8220;Harvards for the masses.&#8221; That changed soon after I was admitted: The college started a new program that would admit blacks with a C average (whites and Asians had to average A minus). I was sitting in the college cafeteria one day when suddenly, its floor-to-ceiling window was broken by rock-throwing, rampaging blacks. They were angry that the college that had already lowered standards to admit them and given them free tuition did not also pay for textbooks! One cannot generalize from 30 angry blacks to an entire population, but that incident made me start to wonder whether blacks&rsquo; failures were all because of white people.</p>
<p>The next key moment was when  &mdash;  good liberal that I was  &mdash;  I took a position as the leader of a drug rap group in a largely black junior high school. My family had always taught me, &#8220;Treat people with respect, and they will respond in kind.&#8221; Not those students. They treated politeness as a sign of weakness. They frequently ran around the room, fighting with each other. I was unable to reason with them.</p>
<p>My next enlightening experience came when I was a student in the Ph.D. program in educational psychology at one of the nation&rsquo;s top universities. There, I was introduced to the predictive validity of IQ. I also learned that the IQs of identical twins raised apart were much more similar than the IQs of fraternal twins raised together, and that abundant studies showed that blacks  &mdash;  worldwide  &mdash;  had much lower IQs than whites or Asians. This did not prove that the black-white difference is genetic, but it certainly suggested it. The next key moment was reading <cite><a href="/store/paved_with_good.html"><b>Paved With Good Intentions,</b></a></cite> a book replete with documentation of the ills African Americans perpetrate on America.</p>
<p>As affirmative action morphed from equal opportunity to reverse discrimination, my concern about the impact of blacks on society grew, both from an intellectual and personal perspective. After completing my Ph.D. (at the top of my class), I applied for dozens of professorships but could not get a job. I got an inkling as to why at the end of what seemed like a perfect interview. The committee members nodded in agreement at nearly everything I said, often smiling. Afterwards, all the committee members except the department chair left, and he asked me to stay behind. I dared hope he would offer me the job. Instead, he said, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll deny saying it, but I want to save you the wondering. You are, by far, the best candidate for the job, but you don&rsquo;t stand a ghost of chance of getting it. The dean has informed us that the next seven hires <em>will be</em> women or minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was forced to go back to teaching inner-city kids. Again, I found most of the blacks remarkably unintelligent, often violent, and often impossible to reason with. After three years, I landed a temporary one-year position as lecturer at a university. My office mate was a Hispanic woman  &mdash;  a truly unintelligent, abysmal teacher. At the end of the year, she was offered a tenure-track job and I was released despite outstanding student evaluations and even a student protest over the decision not to rehire me. I&rsquo;ve since seen reverse discrimination become ever more extreme, along with the unfair denigration of white males in textbooks, college classes, sitcoms, news shows, etc., etc.</p>
<p>I believe this trend cannot be reversed. The demographic trends; the liberals in control of schools, colleges, and media; and the liberalization of voter registration (motor voter, voting over a week-long period) will mean America becomes dominated by anti-meritocracy and anti-white forces. The few people brave enough to speak out are censored or dubbed as Nazis. The price that people like Phil Rushton (his book <cite><a href="https://store.amren.com/cart.php?target=product&amp;product_id=1595&amp;category_id=95"><b>Race, Evolution, and Behavior</b></a></cite> was also influential in changing my views) Michael Levin, and of course, Arthur Jensen, have paid is unconscionable.</p>
<p>I make my living in the politically correct world and therefore cannot give my name lest I risk losing my livelihood.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m reading these stories, and I&rsquo;m thinking about what a poster said here several weeks ago, in relation the NAACP asking Gov. Ed Rendell to declare martial law in Harrisburg.  The poster said that blacks are running around in circles.  They complain about too many black men in prison.  When they get their way, that brings about more crime.  Then they complain about more crime.  When their complaints about crime are addressed, this only puts more black men in prison, and the vicious circle continues.</p>
<p>I think what blacks don&rsquo;t understand that they&rsquo;re in a vicious circle here.  I think what they think is that whites behave and a much smaller percentage of them are in prison because white people have some sort of magic potion that makes themselves behave.  The obvious solution is for us to give blacks that magic potion.  An animist mind can&rsquo;t possibly conceive that there is no magic to it.</p>

<p>I agree.  We have reached critical mass.  Although we are still, figure-wise, the majority, too many of us are asleep and are not anywhere near waking up.  In fact, our greatest enemies are our own.  And, they have outsmarted us.  Yes, it&rsquo;s that plain and simple.<br>

		<p>In elementary school the one black student in accelerated classes would scream racism over anything. This fourth grader obviously got that from her parent(s).</p>
<p>In high school athletics the black parents would openly complain it was racism if their little darlings didn&rsquo;t get all the playing time.</p>
<p>I was hoping things would be better in college (but I knew deep down it wouldn&rsquo;t be so).  I had gone to a high school that was about a quarter black in a &#8220;transitioning&#8221; area.  Blacks were only about 4% of the student population in college (it was a competitive university, so even with affirmative action they had problems making it in), but they were still problems.  Black blocked the (very wide) halls in the dormitories, shucking and jiving, just like in high school.  The black women shrieked loudly at all hours (as did the black men in their dorms, from what I heard).  They were nasty to the white and Asian dormmates.  In an elevator one day they deliberately blocked the entrance  &mdash;  a typical activity  &mdash;  and my friends all had to do the highly deferential &#8220;oh please excuse me, please please please&#8221; and when I didn&rsquo;t beg forgiveness for THEIR rudeness, they started making comments (&#8220;ooooh, she has an ATTITUDE&#8221;).  I then gave them the nastiest look and that actually shut them up.</p>
<p>In law school, most of the lame law professors were (publicly) all for affirmative action, but they would never, NEVER have any of the few black students as their researchers or work with them on anything when it involved their journal articles, etc., just as I&rsquo;m sure they didn&rsquo;t have black doctors, accountants, dentists, etc.  They didn&rsquo;t want the ramifications falling on their work or personal lives.  I did have a law professor I worked for express displeasure with AA practices (he was Jewish, by the way).</p>
<p>Now I am in the working world.  I have witnessed a black woman get promoted up just so she would be out of the department (where she was pissing everyone off because she did no work and had an attitude).  They couldn&rsquo;t fire her; she made it clear she&rsquo;d scream racism.  I&rsquo;ve seen a black guy MAJORLY screw up two projects, including actions that could have gotten us sued, after he had been promoted time and again and is now in a position that is clearly beyond his capabilities.  He acts like he is a division head, even though he has (thankfully) no managerial responsibilities and he won&rsquo;t inform his boss of his actions.  The black interns do nothing except talk loudly, pop attitude, and tell off the regular employees.</p>
<p>I have encountered some good black people, but sadly the majority are not worth my time.  I feel for those who are decent but have to overcome the sloth, attitudes, and incompetence of their peers.</p>

<p>Excuse me, but this sent me into gales of laughter! (I too was a slow learner, in spite of clear lessons of the same sort).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how many cite the black reaction to the O.J. verdict as their principal moment of enlightenment.</p>
<p>I had a similar moment watching the movie &#8220;Menace to Society&#8221; here in Berkeley many years ago. In the movie, a black gangsta&rsquo; had beaten some innocent black half comatose, and began to walk away from his prostrate victim&hellip;.the attacker suddenly turned around and came back to his victim and kicked him very viciously&hellip;the theater audience of about 90% blacks erupted into wild cheering.</p>
<p>I was totally surprised and dumbfounded&hellip;I realized I was witnessing something very &#8220;wierd&#8221; that I had absolutely no understanding of.</p>

		<p>I really love reading these awakenings. It confirms what I have always known and that others have finally understood. Now if we can quit calling each other racist, (Whites, that is) when some of us racially aware folk speak out, then maybe we can form a cohesive unit among those of our own race as all the other races do. We have been marginalized and are now on the outside looking in and it is time we take back our nation from those who want to steal what we and our ancestors built for their PROGENY.</p>

		<p>I have also learned the hard way that Blacks will never be happy with what they have. Even when telling them that they are the richest and freest black people in the world there is still &#8220;work to be done&#8221; by this time it is a question of bean counting, if there are not enough blacks applying to a certain job or school then something should be done to entice more blacks to apply for the job or to the school, irregardless of how qualified they might be. At least the poor teacher in the above article was told the truth so that he could go elsewhere. At this point I think that domination of Whites is what Blacks are truly after, since they now have special protected status. </p>
<p>I have seen this kind of racial pandering often at various jobs that I have held. The entry level positions were held by a diverse group of people, of all ages and races, with Whites dominating since the area I lived in was predominantly White. As you went up the ladder of management it got younger and blacker. For example, the first levels of managment were the &#8220;floor supervisor&#8221; that assisted agents with difficult calls and the &#8220;escallations team&#8221; which took calls where the caller wanted a &#8220;supervisor&#8221;. These teams reflected the age, gender and racial composition of the company at large and were about the highest level a White male over about 40 could aspire to (age discrimination was rampant here). The next level was the team supervisor, who was over about 10-15 agents and was responsible for attendance and other agent statistics. This group was about 50% Black and about 50% female with the average age being about 25. Above this were the actual managers who had about 10 team supervisors reporting to them. These were nearly all black and female with one of them having an extremly rude response to any White person speaking to her. Since these women had to have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree to hold this position they were older but still almost all black or other minorities. The only exception to this rule was the quality assurance specialists, since actual job performance mattered here they tended to be white and of all ages. One older man that I worked with daily had applied 10 times by his own counting (he kept copies of the internal applications) and had only been intervied 1 time without success, this man had been a manager at his previous job and had been let go due to downsizing. This was at just one company but could have been repeated at every job that I had. If you were White and male you did not have a chance, if you were White and female you had a little better chance but not by much. I made it to the floor supervisor position and eventually quit due to the rude attitudes of the team supervisors and managers. One day I had problems signing in to my computer and went for help at the front desk. I had gone in 20 minutes early to avoid the draconian punishment of even being a minute late signing in, when I asked for help the hispanic woman manning the front desk told me to &#8220;come in earlier next time&#8221; I finally blew up at her and showed her my punch sheet where I had clearly gotten to the office 20 minutes before my scheduled time and asked her if I should start coming in an hour early. She looked at me with scarcely disguised disgust and said &#8220;if that is what it takes&#8221; Another manager would walk by my desk and whisper &#8220;white bread&#8221; or &#8220;cracker&#8221;. I complained many times and nothing was ever done about it. </p>
<p>I would counsel any White man or young person leaving high school to try to do their best to get a job or even start their own business where they do not have to go into the corporate world or any sort of politically correct field like teaching. If you have the test scores and grades to do so going into a field like law or medicine would guarantee some sort of employment upon graduation (keep in mind you would have to out perform all of the minorities applying for limited spaces) If you do not have either then try for a blue collar career where skills trump race (for now). My husband has a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and a couple of associate&rsquo;s degrees and makes very good money driving a truck over the road. The best he could do with his degree was 15 an hour at an office with the same sort of racial politics. College is a waste of money unless you are going for a degree with a job title stated in the degree (ie Accounting, Education or Nursing) </p>

		<p>Our ancestors did not have political correctness to deal with when seeing what Blacks really are.  They knew what they saw.  The evidence for what Blacks are is in full view.  Most White people are blinded by the 24/7/365 media conditioning that they&rsquo;ve been receiving for the last 80 years.  I wish we could get all currently awakened White people in the same place at the same time so we knew what our numbers were.  I wish.</p>

		<p>I lived around black people my whole life and I &#8216;ve studied them so I would know my enemy.I also have studied whites and I watched how they gave up their racial identity and how fellow whites looked down on me for maintaining my own racial identity.These whites thought they were higher classed than me and I was the big racist and they privately laughed at me.It took some time to go by and now alot of whites who sneered at me have come to the same conclusion that I realized years ago.The problem as I see it is these whites don&rsquo;t know what to do with these feelings that  contradict what society is telling them.Should they believe the multicults or their own lying eyes.</p>

		<p> &#8220;One day, I was sitting in the college cafeteria when suddenly, its floor-to-ceiling window was broken by rock-throwing, rampaging blacks.  They were angry that the college which had already lowered standards to admit them and given them free tuition did not also pay for textbooks!  <br>
One cannot generalize from 30 angry blacks to an entire population, but that incident made me start to wonder whether blacks&rsquo; failures were all because of white people.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s a sobering thought to stop and realize realize that those very same rock-throwing, rioting blacks, back then,  are probably now sitting somewhere as judges, personnel officers, directors of admissions,  deans of such-and-such,  vice-presidents of this-or-that, regional managers of whatever &hellip; and in other similarly influential and well paying  jobs carrying all the prestige and respect that those positions confer.  I have actually known  and dealt with some of these artificially promoted people, who bewildered me. Your story explains much.</p>

		<p>Most white Anericans&rsquo; attitudes towards blacks haven&rsquo;t changed that much&hellip; it&rsquo;s just the old guard has died off.  Current generations have been brainwashed through our educational system and through mass media.  Also, prior generations didn&rsquo;t pass along important information about race and culture like they should have.  My kids are racially-conscious and culturally-conscious, and that is my doing.  They are exposed to the same old Marxist propaganda as much as any other American child being publicly-educated.  I make the difference!<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly an awakening, but the late Michael Jackson is in the news. He&rsquo;s being present as not just a great entertainer but also as an important &#8216;crossover&rsquo; artist, and a racial hero/conciliator. As if it is whites who are racist, and as if whites haven&rsquo;t been listening to black musicians since at least Louis Armstrong. It&rsquo;s just the same drone with the media, but each generation of young folks are too dumb to know any better. What would really be a &#8216;crossover&rsquo; and would be quite an amazing racial accomplishment, would be if there were white artists accepted by the African American community.</p>

		<p>A common theme here is how young people are being brainwashed by the educational system. Here in Montgomery County MD, that is indeed the case. Those of you without kids may not realize how hard it is to undo all the damage that the school system inflicts. February is the worst month, being Black History Month. I am trying to instill in my children a sense of racial conciousness as well as knowing how race affects your personal security, and why they should stay away from black areas and events. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already told them never to date non-whites, but especially blacks. I&rsquo;ve told them to never present me with a &#8220;Guess Who&rsquo;s Coming to Dinner&#8221; moment. I&rsquo;ve made clear to them that, unlike the movie, there isn&rsquo;t going to be any dinner.</p>

		<p>It took me 30 years to break free from my paralyzing case of white guilt. I lived mostly in a pleasant bubble in which the few black people I went to school with were impressively intelligent and articulate. The occasional times I caught a glimpse of true racial differences, I fought against logic and insisted to myself that surely this, too, was a product of oppressive racism.</p>
<p>My husband and I had many spirited arguments on this topic&hellip; I accused him of being racist, and he accused me of being naive.</p>
<p>Then, in my mid-30&rsquo;s, I came across a website called The Death of Johannesburg (https://tinyurl.com/jburg). In photos and words, it detailed the decline and decay of Johannesburg, South Africa after it was &#8220;liberated&#8221; from white rule and taken over by blacks (something I cheered for at the time that it happened   &mdash;   hooray, the evil whites had been ousted!).</p>
<p>I stayed up until 2:00am reading every blog entry, every comment, absorbing every photo. It was sickening to see photos of the once-majestic city, now decayed into one giant slum. Hundreds of comments from white exiles mourned how their once-beautiful neighborhoods were now the equivalent of Skid Row, and how crime had overtaken the city (many spoke of themselves or family members who were repeatedly robbed, beaten, raped, and/or murdered).</p>
<p>I had seen a similar site that focused on the ruins of Detroit, but it wasn&rsquo;t until I found the Death of Johannesburg site that it finally clicked: THEY ARE THE SAME EVERYWHERE. Of course, mercifully, there are exceptions (I&rsquo;ve known many of them!), but I could no longer deny the truth about our innate racial differences.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always refreshing to read these type of race realist stories from everyday people. What&rsquo;s even more refreshing is looking at comment sections from popular and well read news stories that involve Blacks behaving badly and seeing that more and more people are taking sides with logic and reason. With the anonymity of the internet, we can express out true feelings. What I hope is that those that have seen the light can actually get their acts together and organize to rise up and show political strength. </p>
<p>I know many think that all is lost, but let&rsquo;s be honest; White people are still the majority and most White people know the stakes despite what many want to say otherwise. Whites are just restricted from speaking about it and feel pressured to mouth the PC mantra of diversity, but I&rsquo;ve found that if I just speak honestly then most Whites will freely speak of their disdain for America&rsquo;s current multicultural nightmare. Those that object? To hell with them! Why would I care what any sick minded liberal has to say to me about racism? They are the enemy and we need to stop wasting time coddling those that want to destroy us. Stop biting your tongues and get the truth out there.</p>

		<p>It is also sad for me to see the town where I grew up in gradually becoming blacker. The beach that my friends and I went swimming at as kids is now almost all black, when we were kids (this was south Louisiana in the late 70&rsquo;s) the blacks would stay on one side of the beach and the Whites on the other. Whites are now going to a new beach on the south side of town. Schools were still de facto segregated in the 1970&rsquo;s but that was gradually changed by combining a couple of high schools and making one a &#8220;magnet&#8221; school to attract whites (far on the black side of town) </p>
<p>The blacks in the town where we actually lived were separated by a series of railroad tracks and had originally had their own schools but when desegregation happened in the sixties the segregated high school was turned into a jr high and the elementary school was eventually combined with a neighboring white school. Almost as soon as desegregation happened the blacks started complaining. When the local refineries expanded and ended up across the street from a section of this neighborhood the blacks started saying that they were developing lung cancer and other illnesses at a much higher rate than the rest of the population of the town. This was not the case since many in my own neighborhood had been ill too, before the refineries installed environmental controls to keep pollution at bay. Jesse Jackson and others got envolved and many houses were moved to other locations at refinery expense. After the houses were moved, some of the other residents complained that they did not have equal access to highway 90 and had to drive miles out of the way to get to grocery stores of other conviences since there were none in their neighborhood. So at great city expense there was a new railroad crossing built so that the blacks could more easily access highway 90. The new complaint is that there are no grocery stores, banks or other businesses in the area. The last convience store closed a few years ago due to robberies and eventually the clerk (a black man) was killed so the store was closed. I would think that if they would stop robbing stores then more would move into the area! When I was a kid nobody talked about that part of town and we never went there since there was no reason for us to go there. I heard the story about the homes being moved by reading an article about it on the internet. Race baiters had obviously written the article since a photoshopped picture had accompanied it (I knew the pic was photoshopped since I grew up in the area). The photo showed a black man kneeling in a cemetery (stated to be in that neighborhood) with a refinery belching black smoke in the background. The cememtery shown was miles away on the outskirts of town and there are no cemeteries anywhere near this neighborhood. I do not know where this will end with Blacks demanding more and more and giving back less and less. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d say that my Southern grandparents (I&rsquo;m almost 70) had roughly the same attitude and feelings towards blacks that the average person today would have toward rehabilitated child molesters.</p>
<p>The sad but human truth is that it&rsquo;s that level of instinctive revulsion that was required for our race to easily maintain for so long a time a system of separation that worked. The thought of physically touching a black person, or eating with one, was revolting to my  grandparents and to many Southerners of their time.</p>
<p>But even in that time, there were many Southerners who had softer feelings towards blacks and warmer relationships with them, and by the time of my parents, mature adults in the 1950s, feelings had softened to such an extent that the stiff white resistance to integration in the South practically evaporated overnight when an Alabama black church was bombed and 4 black children inside were killed.</p>
<p>For our readiness to be halted in our tracks by guilt over this extreme act, instead of recognizing with sorrow that in any serious struggle there will always be some criminals who will commit such acts, whites have been rewarded by having visited upon them many thousands of deaths, hundreds of thousands of rapes, and limitless other miseries at the hands of blacks.</p>
<p>Whites are going to have to toughen up considerably if this problem is ever going to be solved.</p>

<p>If you have a guilty conscience about the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham in 1963, you don&rsquo;t need to.  Virtually all of the bombers were FBI informants, i.e provocateurs.

		<p>The early years in middle- and high school opened my eyes to the detrimental influence blacks have in the classroom. I distinctly remember we had three of them in my social studies class and the few times they even bothered to show up was to disrupt the class and act like typical black kids. When it came time to hand in a report, they collaboraed on a half-baked missive on slavery and handed out xeroxs of that picture all whites have seen by now of African slaves packed in like sardines on a slave ship. They acted angry and dissed at the class and tried to lay a guilt trip on us white students. The instructor had to give them a good grade for fear of being called a racist. From that day forward I knew we were better off under segregation. It was like sharing a classroom with malignant aliens from another planet.</p>

		<p>Long ago, in a country now being taken over by illegal immigrants from third world countries on top of racial conflict that has never ceased, my father explained that upon the signing of the bogus civil rights laws, whites would be shoved aside and that blacks would never be satisifed until whitey was picking their cotton and washing their floors.  And if possible, blacks would want to see whitey totally expelled from the country they had founded.  </p>
<p>And here we are more than 40 years after the signing of those laws and everything my Dad said has come true.  We are no closer to racial harmoney than we were during Jim Crow or the racial upheaval of the 60&rsquo;s.  Do I believe in conspiracies?  Absolutely not.  But I do believe that the people that wrote and passed those laws KNEW exactly what they were doing when they turned the country on its ear and dished it&rsquo;s fruits out on a golden platter to minorities.</p>
<p>If you could ask any one of those men and/or women who signed the civil rights laws, how those same laws affected them and/or their children or grandchildren, they could not honesty answer because while they were writing laws that affected all us lower classes, they were living in their posh homes and sending their kids to private, elite schools.  Ask Teddy (hiccup) Kennedy, if mass immigration from the third world affected  him or his kids.  He would have to answer that he may have gotten a cheaper gardner.</p>

Friends, we will prevail. There is a simple and brutal reason. <br>
Blacks and coloreds in power will collapse the economy because of their ineptitudes (see IQ and wealth of nations). ordinary whites will not rise unless they sense fire, but when their darling mores are endangered by sinking economy and growing totalitarianism, the things will change. We will win exactly because of our better brains and discipline even if we are at odds.  But meanwhile we must work and propagate the Knowledge.</p>

Not as likely. Im sure that there were blacks employed by the refineries, but since these were the very sought after jobs in this area I am sure that there were no complaints until later. I have read articles about the alleged higher cancer rates in poor or black communities that are supposed to be closer to the industrial facilities than white or more upper class areas. The article stated that there was more tobacco use as well as a poorer diet noted in the black areas that could be a contributer to cancer. As far as people living close to the refineries or other industries in my hometown, there were whites that lived just as close as the complaining blacks but there was nobody willing to help them. The black residents were even given nifty little bucket type air sniffers so that if they smelled something funny or saw the refinery flaring they could capture the air and have it analized to see if there was anything dangerous in the air. The industries, mostly petrochemical, have made huge strides in reducing air and water pollution but blacks are not still not happy.

		<p>During my first years of college I was very liberal. I had internalized the indoctrination through schooling and television without self-awareness. However, I had never felt comfortable with liberal ideology. It bothered me that my professors would often accuse whites of racism when all the whites I knew went out of their way  &mdash;  and with almost saintly patience  &mdash;   to be kind to and win acceptance from nonwhites, while the nonwhite students were unabashidly proud of their race. There was a disconnect between what I was being told in class and what I experienced in the real world. For a while I began listening to the &#8220;conservative&#8221; rhetoric on the radio, or reading &#8220;conservative&#8221; books. But I quickly outgrew this phase because most of the talk consisted of angy tirades against what the liberals were doing at anytime, without any articulation of sound principles in opposition to liberalism. Also, I began to see that &#8220;conservatives&#8221; cared more about defending a certain economic system or political party than white people. I began to wonder if there was anyone who was speaking for me and other whites. That is when I discovered AR, Occidental Weekly, and other sites. Although I don&rsquo;t consider myself racist, I am a racialist. It seems clear to me that the white nation is in real trouble if white people do not quickly develope a sense of community and solidarity as EVERY OTHER RACE IS DOING. </p>

<p>#26, you are correct. We Whites have an ability to choose and follow leaders, for formulating a plan, AND following that plan to fruition. Blacks are unable to do either past the initial assault stage, after which, the loot, rob, rape and pillage syndrom takes over and they become fair and easy to eliminate.</p>

They were seen as &#8216;old racists&rsquo; and even &#8216;Nazis&rsquo; by the younger generation (especially the 60s generation) who ignorantly believed that a colorless, raceless culture could be created.  The hostile elites were happy to exploit this stupidity and we are paying the price to this day.</p>
<p>Turns out the older generation was correct.  My genteel, glove-wearing, Virginia-bred grandmother appeared to be a monstrous racist toward blacks.  She was admonished by the next generation who later  &#8216;saw the light&rsquo; through real world experiences, and the next generation and so on.  Now, to my own daughter, I am an &#8216;old racist&rsquo; as I describe to her the dangers blacks pose to Whites and explain why she received so many college rejections with a 4.66 GPA and scores in the 99th percentile on her SATs  &mdash;  yet blacks with &#8216;C&rsquo; averages and first quartile test scores were happily accepted and even offered full scholarships from these same universities.</p>
<p>It is slow going trying to un-do years of brainwashing and indoctrination.  I suspect the schools are doing a better job than the Khmer Rouge ever did.  </p>
<p>It is indeed unfortunate that so many refuse to &#8216;see the light&rsquo; until they are either raped, repeatedly robbed, assaulted or otherwise victimized by blacks  &mdash;  and then find the media, government and even the police department have no sympathy for them and often side with black offenders .   What our young people are taught (or not taught) is obscene and criminal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no high school textbooks use the example of the old Soviet State to show what happens when any government strives and ultimately fails to build a raceless, classless civilization  &mdash;  the results being vicious savagery, brutality and genocide resulting in 65 million dead.  This is because the writers of modern high school textbooks admire the old Soviet State and long for its implementation here (which we&rsquo;re getting).</p>
<p>Yes, Teach Your Children Well!  Get them out of the government schools if possible so they too may &#8216;see the light&rsquo; before they are victimized not only by black but by the government schools as well.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I wish we could get all currently awakened White people in the same place at the same time so we knew what our numbers were.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact is that MOST white people, right now, don&rsquo;t want to live around non-whites. </p>
<p>MOST white people want to live in an all white country (as we have done for over 10,000 years).<br>
I can prove it unequivocally, without even asking any of them their opinions, by using scientific facts, otherwise known as &#8216;Revealed Preference&rsquo;.<br>
In the 1950s, when the first black families came over here (the U.K.) to live, they moved into certain areas. Those areas rapidly became &#8216;ghettos&rsquo; and experienced an increase in non-whites, and a decrease in whites. <br>
As soon as a house went up for sale in one of those areas, in the 1960s and 1970s, there would have been at least twenty times as many potential WHITE buyers as non-white. Yet somehow, those areas became more and more non-white. The ONLY scientific explanation for this is if the vast majority of potential white buyers did not want to live around non-whites. This is a hypothesis which is proved correct by the actions of literally MILLIONS of white house buyers, over the past fifty years. It cannot be refuted, or argued against. It is the ONLY explanation.<br>
So the next time a leftie tries to tell you that &#8216;most&rsquo; white people just love &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo;, ask them about house buying choices&hellip;</p>
<p>This explanation applies to non-whites in ALL white countries. Revealed Preference shows us what the vast majority of whites REALLY think.<br>

Like a good game of chess, plan several steps ahead of your enemy. We have to let all of those white people under 25, who voted for Obama, feel the &ldquo;joys&rdquo; of Diversity &amp; Multiculturalism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how most of us woke up, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>&gt; The problem with this idea is that the experience paragram shifts over time.  Being oppressed and last in line, labeled as evil, can become a normal state - especially when your people are not allowed to have a community. And this is what our enemies have succeeded best at; they have split Whites apart, denied us free association.  Any association of Whites or for Whites is automatically opposed - even by our government, and even when it is a conservative government, so entrenched is the notion of White evil.  What chance have young Whites have when they can only see themselves as individuals with no racial identity, except in a negative way?</p>
<p>So this is the purpose of all this posting and work: to get up - create the courage to stand together and protect ourselves against those who wish to destroy us. But first we will have to learn to accept one another - allow some differences between us to exist.  I suggest that once we can set up an national organization for White people that doesn&rsquo;t have Nazi flags or Confederate flags as its symbols but defends and promotes White survival and progress, it will be able to gain a place without (successful) dispute/attack from others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Long ago, in a country now being taken over by illegal immigrants from third world countries on top of racial conflict that has never ceased, my father explained that upon the signing of the bogus civil rights laws, whites would be shoved aside and that blacks would never be satisifed until whitey was picking their cotton and washing their floors. And if possible, blacks would want to see whitey totally expelled from the country they had founded. </p>
<p>And here we are more than 40 years after the signing of those laws and everything my Dad said has come true. We are no closer to racial harmoney than we were during Jim Crow or the racial upheaval of the 60&rsquo;s. Do I believe in conspiracies? Absolutely not. But I do believe that the people that wrote and passed those laws KNEW exactly what they were doing when they turned the country on its ear and dished it&rsquo;s fruits out on a golden platter to minorities.</p>
<p>If you could ask any one of those men and/or women who signed the civil rights laws, how those same laws affected them and/or their children or grandchildren, they could not honesty answer because while they were writing laws that affected all us lower classes, they were living in their posh homes and sending their kids to private, elite schools. Ask Teddy (hiccup) Kennedy, if mass immigration from the third world affected him or his kids. He would have to answer that he may have gotten a cheaper gardner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I respect you and enjoy your posts, but I don&rsquo;t agree with your idea that Ted Kennedy and others really knew exactly what they were creating.  I think that if they knew, they would have worked in limits to immigration, methods for sampling issues like busing, integration - for the purpose of seeing if it would work out in the long run, etc.  Of course, you and I and others here knew the answers, but under the political pressures of the time, this would be necessary.  (I do concede however, that Ted Kennedy has promoted the extreme liberal agenda, but with the same amount of intellectual control that he has excercised as an alcoholic).</p>
<p>I think the momentum of the problem has a good metaphor in the story of &#8220;The Sorcerer&rsquo;s Apprentice.&#8221;  Some do-gooders wanted to try some ideas out on America and so they passed some legislation.  But once it got going, it took on a life of its own bureaucratically, and of course, when money can be made from it, and that is a truth if anything is - the thing is then propelled economically.  With no shortage of shortsightedness on any side, things have been spinning out of control for a long time.  Now, the situation is many ways is approaching the unsustainable.  I mean that in every way, but certainly where racial/national issues are concerned.</p>

<p>I also know, from working in a very large organization which is very PC, that most whites (except for a minuscule few) are racially fragmented and atomized, have no sense of racial identity, and will always do what is good for THEMSELVES  first, regardless of the harmful effect on other  whites.  It&rsquo;s dog-eat-dog, and as minority pressures and competition among whites continue to grow, the infighting and backstabbing will get worse. It&rsquo;s like a game of musical chairs, with 10 white persons and only 9 chairs&hellip; someone&rsquo;s going to be eliminated, and no one will have any sympathy for him.   </p>
<p>Whites will pander and grovel to whatever person is put in charge (regardless of race) and will invariably put their own advancement  and careers first.  They won&rsquo;t hesitate to sell out other whites if it&rsquo;s to their own advantage, not stopping to think that their turn may come next month.  So great is the mult-culti brainwashing that even the merest suggestion of racial loyalty would be met with outrage.  It would be considered subversive. </p>

<p>Steven Sailer wrote about this. Saying something like, young whites wish to get ahead, and in at least some small sense, do feel they are superior and believe and are hopeful that they will get ahead, so they ignore anecdotal evidence and assume everything will work out fine for them. Or that in the big picture everything will work out fine. The media must constantly tell them only blacks are victims and whites have nothing to worry about, and indeed have no interests at all. Anyone who might wonder if a white person is victimized is soon labeled in the &#8216;Nazi&rsquo; camp. Whites are a bit afraid to raise their heads up, too, on the battlefield of life. </p>
<p>To at least a small extent, these &#8216;IQ racists&rsquo; or whatever, at the other end of the spectrum, pretty much sell the same rotten apple. Everything is going great for whites. Nothing to see here or even worry about. </p>

		<p>I visited the New Nation site this morning and read the section covering Black on White crime. It is absolutely appalling to read how many murders, rapes and other hideous assaults are committed against White Americans every day in this once great country.<br>
The down side of the site is the way in which the visitors respond to the news stories. They are extremely angry people who are well prepared to go into action. The use of racially charged epithets by the posters would never be acceptable here on AMREN. There is also quite a bit of anti-semitic diatribe that in my opinion, only weakens our case and repels potential allies.<br>
THat being said, it in no way nullifies the validity of the reports themselves. They come from newspapers and TV video from around the nation. What disgusted me was not the number of crimes, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised, but the fact that with exceptions such as Eve Carson and Anne Presseley they get no publicity outside the region in which they occurred while the story of the MONTCO, PA swimclub has been all over the airwaves including some foreign counties. There is truly a Dirty War being waged against us organized or not. THe body count is high.<br>
 If any of our AMREN readers haven&rsquo;t seen this site, hold your noses and visit it.</p>

I&rsquo;ve since seen reverse discrimination become ever more extreme, along with the unfair denigration of white males in textbooks, college classes, sitcoms, news shows, etc., etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>   Regrettably, this sad story is completely true. I&rsquo;ve seen many cases where promising young white professors were made a grisly sacrifice on the diabolic alter of multi-culturalism. Affirmative Action has degenerated into formal quotas, rather than a set of guidelines.</p>

<p>In other words it is just like AmRen. Selectively disclosed racism against whites followed by whites in each case being equally ignorant, at least in print, and using the &#8216;N&rsquo; word or something, and of course posters saying they will defend whites and even go into action. I&rsquo;m sure discussion on various makes of weaponry as well as tales of markmanship prowiss.</p>
<p>White racism must never grow popular, and no one is doing more to prevent crimes in anger against the non-white population ever. Because a crime against a non-white somewhere would be a real crime.</p>

<p>Mostly true in the recent past but things are changing. When I first found AR there were not many posters and now there are What?? hundreds or more and many times that in readers.

Our own kind, via political corruption and perhaps even mental illness, have created the toxic environment that allows the worst of blacks to actively destroy what&rsquo;s left of what was once a civilized, unified, and bold society that truly was a beacon for the rest of the world; worst of all is I don&rsquo;t see this trend changing - God help us.</p>

		<p>  Someone earlier said these stories of &#8220;seeing the light&#8221; in the original AR article would make for a great Amren book.  I concur!  And I would add to such a book, many of the fascinating responses of commenters to the AR website for parts I-III.  Someone mentioned in response that Dr. Robert Griffin&rsquo;s book &#8220;One Sheaf, One Vine&#8221; is a good collection of racial awakening stories from people, and it is.  I still think an AR version of these stories would be very helpful in showing people that they&rsquo;re &#8220;not alone&#8221; and the personal, anecdotal reasons underlying white racial realism and white nationalism.</p>
<p>    One distressing note, however, it seems that a common thread through all of these stories is that it took a very nasty experience with a nonwhite, usually a violent one, that provoked a racial awakening among our people.  As many noted, their mostly white upbringing combined with the lies our schools, government, churches, news, Hollywood, and colleges tell us about race, has lulled most white senses.  </p>
<p>     That, and I think most whites are naturally less likely to obsess about racial matters than nonwhites on average.  Anti-white Leftists would disagree and say it is white racism that is the cause of all the nonwhite problems in the world.  But really, it is our historic white naivete which has lead Occidental Civilization to the tragic place it is now in.  </p>
<p>    In any event, if white racial awakening is going to require every white to be literally &#8220;mugged by reality&#8221; (to use Irving Kristol&rsquo;s old phrase), either physically and/or metaphorically   &mdash;   we are going to have to wait a *long* time for our average white folk to wake up.   It&rsquo;s true, nonwhites are &#8220;mugging&#8221; us in disproportionate rates, but even with those high rates of crime and misbehavior, most whites will be unaffected.  What can we do that will convince the majority of our people?  (I realize a certain segment of our race are simply hopeless in this matter). It is a vexing question, I know.</p>
<p>   In any event, I do recall my own racial awakening occurred in the 1990s, and it was thanks to sensible outlets like AR, among others, I was able to see these views were not &#8220;crazy&#8221; or advanced by unintelligent and/or violent skinhead-types.  Still, I felt very &#8220;alone&#8221; in my views, very isolated.  I was very bothered by this.  And I felt as if I was &#8220;the only one in the world&#8221; who would go through daily life seeing these things through a pro-white, race-realist lens.  It was with the rise of the internet, and reading stories like these and comments from people with similar experiences that made me realize I&rsquo;m not &#8220;alone&#8221; in having these views.  Eventually, I was able to meet a few like-minded friends who share our views, and this is a reassuring comfort.  Alas, most of my family does not share this view, or most of the people I know.  Anyway, I enjoyed reading these stories and seeing how others arrived at the place I am at, and I am hopeful they may lead to more &#8220;conversions&#8221; of our people.</p>

		<p>What finally did it for me was watching the reactions of students at Howard University live on television when the OJ verdict was read. I realized, after years of liberal thought, that it&rsquo;s not about right and wrong for a group that has entitlement fever its all about tribe. </p>
<p>For years I ascribed to the diversity as good policy credo. Melting Pot, Stew then Salad. First we were a nation of immigrants and we were a Melting Pot, all thrown together out of many, one. Then we were a Stew, still some heat involved and much assimilation of flavors but little to no forging. Then we were a Salad – each with our distinct flavors and colors – each unique. The liberal professors at Towson University out did themselves to explain that we were all unique – just that some of us were more unique than others all while they snarled through their clenched teeth about the Evil United States.</p>
<p>While putting myself through college I drove a van for an adult daycare service and winced when once I overheard an elderly ethnic woman tell her bench mate that her Granddaughter &ldquo;&hellip;was 17 years old and still living at home and that it was high time she got pregnant, had a baby, got her own Government Check and moved out.&rdquo; How does one witness that overwhelming sense of entitlement day in and day out and not become jaded. You have to prove to me now that this is not the norm and you are not part of that entitlement crowd.<br>
