<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Russian President Dmitry Medvedev illustrated his call for a supranational currency to replace the dollar by pulling from his pocket a sample coin of a &#8220;united future world currency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; Medvedev told reporters today in L&rsquo;Aquila, Italy, after a summit of the Group of Eight nations. &#8220;You can see it and touch it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The coin, which bears the words &#8220;unity in diversity,&#8221; was minted in Belgium and presented to the heads of G-8 delegations, Medvedev said.</p>

<p>Well, Putin&rsquo;s lapdog Comrade Medvedev, certainly proves his lack of originality here. If he wished to mint a coin that could uniquely insult a normal human&rsquo;s intelligence, inscribing it with &ldquo;unity in diversity&rdquo; is not the way to go; it is so 1990s passé after all. Why not something innovative like: &lsquo;human health in leprosy,&rsquo; or &lsquo;hunger abolishment through sewage consumption?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>     Just wait a few months when hyperinflation hits us. It will make what&rsquo;s happening in Zimbabwe look like child&rsquo;s play. For seventy years our politicians have been handing out money to every group just to get their votes. Altruism and the lust for power has ruined this and many other so-called advanced nations. Just listen to the various groups who have a sense of entitlement scream when the piggy bank is empty. I hope you have some gold and silver stashed away.</p>

		<p>The back of the coin looks like a pot leaf, the resin of which you have to be smoking in order to think that world government is a good idea.  </p>
<p>If this thing comes to pass, you&rsquo;ll need a trillion of them to buy a loaf of bread.  It&rsquo;ll be the only currency less valuable than the Zimbabwe Dollar.</p>
<p>It is ironic that Medvedev is spouting &#8220;unity in diversity,&#8221; as Muslim militants and Chinese immigration eat into Russia.</p>

		<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it - the cat is out of the bag.  The Russians hope for a world government that they will lead.</p>
<p>I was wrong.  But I think that they are dreaming.  No one will accept Russian dominance or even advice.  After all, they are so well loved on their own borders.</p>

		<p>The creator of the coin had to be someone who has some serious problems with recognizing what the real world is all about.  Anybody who thinks there is unitity in diversity hasn&rsquo;t picked up the paper and read it it much, because, if he did, he would note that there are bitter conflicts everyday because of forcing different people together.</p>
<p>I think it would be quite humorous come 2012 and the world is embroiled in total chaos to have those coins in abundance.  </p>
<p>Their creator has to be someone who spends most of his time in a cave or he&rsquo;s so high on dope all the time he&rsquo;s created his own reality and all he can see is a rainbow utopia all around him.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d guess that the Russians only interest in this is to knock Uncle Sam off his perch.  They&rsquo;ll not tie themselves down with foreign capitalist manipulation.  They actually seem to have some national pride.  </p>

		<p>We ahould remember that the Russians snubbed Obama. They perhaps don&rsquo;t think that they should start looking like him? This could be tongue in cheek on Medvedev&rsquo;s part.&#8221;Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY white country and ONLY into white countries.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The Netherlands and Belgium are more crowded than Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to &#8220;assimilate,&#8221; i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;How long would it take anyone to realize I&rsquo;m not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn&rsquo;t object to this?&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.&#8221; <br>

		<p>Continuing what some of you speculate here, I cannot understand the continuing and unnecessary hostility towards Russia by the American foreign policy establishment.  Haven&rsquo;t any of the six figure FP wonks at State ever thought to bring Russia in to a nuclear missile defense shield, instead of isolating them from it?  Perhaps as a measure of good will it should be based in Russia.</p>
<p>I have heard several theories to explain this hostility, but they are problematic for one reason or another.</p>

		<p>I thought Russia was supposed to be one of the few countries left where whites didn&rsquo;t have to worry about being displaced by nonwhites, and multiculturalism is not the state religion. Why are they promoting diversity?</p>

		<p>Of course, if the coin were a gold alloy coin like the Kruggerand* and all the coins, including the smaller denominations, were produced to the same exacting standard and purity, there&rsquo;s be some sense in it. In short, it would be a return to the gold standard. {and we could look forward to long disputes about bimetallism, resurrected from the footnotes of history texts.]</p>
<p>* The Krugerrand is 22 carats [not a too-soft coin of pure or nearly-pure gold of 24 carats] but contains exactly 1 ounce of pure gold. A number of countries, including the U.S.A., produce bullion and bullion-alloy coins intended as rivals of the Kruggerand.</p>

		<p>Diversity is like the difference between the words &#8220;Mixture&#8221; and &#8220;Emuslion&#8221; Mixtures stay mixed. Emulsions, if left alone, will separate into their original componants. Life should be like that.</p>
