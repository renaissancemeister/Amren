<h1>Officer Sues South Windsor Police, Claims Discrimination</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Leavenworth, Hartford (Connecticut) Courant, July 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A black police officer has sued the town, contending she was discriminated against because of her race and gender.</p>
<p>Officer Nicole Little says police supervisors and other officers belittled and harassed her, causing her hypertension, severe emotional distress, anxiety and loss of sleep, according to the suit filed recently in Superior Court in Hartford.</p>
<p>Little, 37, who was hired in 2004, is the first and only African American to become a sworn police officer in South Windsor. As an outsider, she became a target, according to the suit, which includes these claims:</p>
<p>At a firing range in 2004, Sgt. Peter Alix told Little, &#8220;Chief [Gary Tyler] always says anyone is welcome to leave. This isn&rsquo;t a plantation,&#8221; the suit states.</p>
<p>In 2005, Alix told Little that she &#8220;needed to put the angry black woman away,&#8221; the suit states.</p>
<p>Commander Matthew Reed told Little in 2006 that her probationary status was extended because she had &#8220;reportedly engaged in nonverbal behavior such as rolling her eyes and sucking her teeth,&#8221; the suit states.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon information and belief, these said nonverbal behaviors are typically associated with an &#8216;angry black woman,&rsquo;&#8221; the suit states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other officers shunned Little, throwing away their meals and leaving a break room when she entered and not accompanying her when she was rushed to an area hospital after having chest pains on duty. Police supervisors, according to the suit, told officers that associating with Little was &#8220;career suicide.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Little is seeking damages of &#8220;more than $15,000,&#8221; a standard request in such lawsuits. Her lawyer, Patrick Tomasiewicz of Hartford-based Fazzano, Tomasiewicz &amp; Barall, said Little continues to work for the department, but he did not want to make any other comment.<br>

		<p>In this day and age, after the countless lawsuits and &#8220;diversity training&#8221;, does anyone think a police department, especially in the liberal stronghold of the North East, would be hostile toward any minority? If anything, they went out of their way to make sure this affirmative action hire was accepted to the force. They extended her probationary period because of her obvious attitude problem. A white male would have been let go. </p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s had the &#8220;enriching&#8221; experience of working with an angry black woman (such as myself) knows all about the eye rolling, teeth sucking, head shaking, and the attitude. Of course, she will win the lawsuit, or the City will settle out of court. Either way, another black is awarded for bad behavior, another police department is branded racist, and the taxpayers lose again.</p>

		<p>37 and experiencing chest pains while on duty? I&rsquo;d be curious to see her fitness evaluations&hellip; or her BMI&hellip; or perhaps a picture. I wonder if a white in similar health and condition would have gotten the job?</p>

		<p>This woman should consider herself lucky she even got this job, since there is no doubt a white person had to lose out on getting this job so she can have it and the police department could be more &#8220;diverse&#8221;. She probably doesn&rsquo;t even really care for that job anyway.</p>

		<p>People need to relax and hang back.  Avoid minorites and let the oblivious whites and the do gooder whites get caught up in the witch trials. Eventually it will all collapse under its own weight.  Then white people will rebuild. </p>

<p>Even if these allegations are true, I don&rsquo;t see what you can do about much of it. After all, you can&rsquo;t force people to eat their lunch with her! </p>
<p>Or are we going to come to that next? No one can get up and leave when she enters the room. Everyone must chat with her and smile. Those who do not smile sufficiently will be punished. How insane can this enforced diversity get? </p>
<p>Anyway, what I sense from this story (reading between the lines) is that she was a tactless, annoying, unpleasant person who irritated others.  Such behavior as described was not going to win her acceptance anywhere.  But that was her personality, not her race.</p>

		<p> While it&rsquo;s not unheard of for a particular member of the workplace to be singled out for harassment or isolation by the others, given the fact that blacks tend to go out of their way to see   &mdash;   and often provoke   &mdash;   &#8220;hostility&#8221; directed toward them, I&rsquo;d say that Officer Little probably has brought on much of it herself (that&rsquo;s assuming any of her allegations are true).</p>
<p> I think she should have taken the advice offered by that higher-ranking officer: Put the &#8220;angry black woman&#8221; away.</p>

<p>This is the way it works in the northeast as a rule, especially New England. Affluent suburbs are socially and politically designed to keep black and non-caucasion numbers minimal through &#8220;De jure&#8221; segregation. This results in &#8220;physical separation&#8221; and continuity of the overwhelmingly white community, thus preserving the status quo.</p>
<p>Despite the regions liberal sentiment, the white populous is well aware of the aggressive and demanding nature of northern blacks. I mean, who wants to deal with angry black women with a chip on their shoulder a mile wide?</p>

		<p>I often say to people, &#8220;I dont dislike people because of their colour or race, I dislike people because of their behaviour and attitudes.  Unfortunately, the people who most often exhibit the behaviour and attitudes I dislike, happen to be Black.&#8221;  Even more unfortunately, I see far too many White people emulating that behaviour and atitudes.  This woman, I can guarantee, exhibited that sort of behaviour and attitudes, and was cold-shouldered because of this. </p>

		<p>Oh boy!  Poor poor baby!  Nicole Little was treated badly because other officers &#8220;threw away their lunches when she entered the break area&#8221; WOW! how awful!  And then they would not accompany her to the local hospital after she had chest pains. <br>
   Could you just imagine a white woman in a all black police department?  She would be going to a local hospital with a lot more than just &#8220;chest pains&#8221; and any possible law suit for damages that are a thousand times worse than in Nicole Little&rsquo;s case would be thrown out by Judges with the mindset of a Sonya Sotomayor.    </p>
