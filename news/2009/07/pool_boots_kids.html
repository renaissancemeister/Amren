			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karen Araiza, NBC Philadelphia, July 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 60 campers from Northeast Philadelphia were turned away from a private swim club and left to wonder if their race was the reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard this lady, she was like, &#8216;Uh, what are all these black kids doing here?&rsquo; She&rsquo;s like, &#8216;I&rsquo;m scared they might do something to my child,&rsquo;&#8221; said camper Dymire Baylor.</p>
<p>The Creative Steps Day Camp paid more than $1900 to The Valley Swim Club. The Valley Swim Club is a private club that advertises open membership. But the campers&rsquo; first visit to the pool suggested otherwise.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the minority children got in the pool all of the Caucasian children immediately exited the pool,&#8221; Horace Gibson, parent of a day camp child, wrote in an email. &#8220;The pool attendants came and told the black children that they did not allow minorities in the club and needed the children to leave immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day the club told the camp director that the camp&rsquo;s membership was being suspended and their money would be refunded.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Campers remain unsure why they&rsquo;re no longer welcome.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There was concern that a lot of kids would change the complexion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the atmosphere of the club,&#8221; John Duesler, President of The Valley Swim Club said in a statement.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this guy is going to &#8220;pull a Imus&#8221; after Al Sharpton gets his claws on him. The blacks will sue and pretty soon will own the swimming pool. If you want an all-White pool you will probably have to move to Maine, Montana or North Dakota.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have the whole story here.   The private swim club told the black children using its pool to beat it, because a camp of white children, which paid the club for the use of the pool, were getting what they paid for.  One of the black children claims that one of the white adult chaperones said something naughty about black people.  We do know for sure that the whites got out as soon as the blacks got in, which is the history of the United States of America in the last several decades.  Except the whites didn&rsquo;t leave their neighborhoods, black crime drove them out.</p>
<p>The reason I don&rsquo;t think this is the whole story because this happened in Philadelphia in 2009, not Mississippi in 1950.  Philadelphia&rsquo;s civic elite, going back to Ben Franklin days, has always been snooty, Quaker and egalitarian.  Ben Franklin didn&rsquo;t much like the German immigrants in the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, those that were actually turning lesser land into productive farms.  And the good Krauts had no use for Philadelphia.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone coming out of that city with any semblance of authority insulting blacks or any minority group.</p>

		<p>PRIVATE clubs should be allowed to set any criteria they want for accepting membership.  We Whites have the RIGHT to not be forced to associate with people we don&rsquo;t want to associate with.  Who the hell do they, and the government, think they are to say we have no choice?</p>

<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t he right? I mean, no one wants to hear rap music while in a country club nor do they want to worry about their possessions suddenly sprouting legs and walking out the front gate. Nor do they want to worry about the safety of their 12 year old daughters being threatened.</p>

		<p>Sounds like they paid for a day camp experience (read: summertime baby sitting) which did not include access to the pool?</p>
<p>Note this multi-functioning 10 acre facility resides next to a country club, so was it a foregone conclusion that a payment for access to any part of this facility included pool time? (I Googled the location info).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this behavior at amusement parks with other attractions attached. The group of disadvantaged kids brought (usually on a school bus and all wearing the same colored t-shirts)to the amusement park side getting upset that their entrance fees did not cover entry to the additional attraction (water slide park). The adult chaperones/leaders misconstrue the financial arrangement (they usually go for the cheapest entry fees) and then very vocally orchestrate discontent among the children once further entry is denied.</p>
<p>I believe this is another non story leading to griping because of certain you-know-whos currently in the White House and Justice Department.</p>

		<p>Let me see if I can use my evil, racist white brain to figure out what really happened-a pack of rude, loud, foulmouthed blacks from Northeast Killadelphia invaded a calm, peaceful private club pool. Within minutes of blacks showing up at the pool, the whites had already had enough of the noise and wisely pulled their children out of the pool and left. </p>

		<p>My blond, blue-eyed 8-year-old niece was grabbed by a couple of black boys in a swimming pool. I would take my children out of a pool that was about to be swarmed by ghetto kids, too.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a private swim club, it should be their right to get rid of them because I imagine membership is not cheap. Who is going to pay through the nose for the privilege of having their gradeschool children groped?</p>

		<p>Good God, can you just imagine what it looked like when these SIXTY &#8220;campers&#8221; from northeast Philadelphia invaded that place! Without a dought, had they been allowed to stay, they would&rsquo;ve taken the place over and several Whites would&rsquo;ve been assaulted, not to mention the vandalism and theft. Take my word, these &#8220;campers&#8221; knew exactly what they were doing by going there. They enjoy nothing more than going someplace they know they&rsquo;re not welcome and rubbing it in the White folks face. They LIVE for those moments. But, for them, it&rsquo;s a win win because now they can all enter their names into the ghetto lottery wheel of fortune. As always, no attempt is made by them to create THEIR OWN swim clubs. Noooooooo, they want to go to the swim clubs that White folks have built, maintained and paid for. I had to laugh though, I would&rsquo;ve paid to have been there and watched all the White kids leaving the pool as the blacks got in and the looks on the baby- momma, baby-daddie faces. Would&rsquo;ve been priceless.  </p>

		<p>My first reaction wasn&rsquo;t about the merits of the private club&rsquo;s case, but by the idiocy of using a term like &#8220;change the complexion.&#8221; One of the fist rules of racial debate is to use half a brain and not say stupid things that will so obviously be used as a club by the opposition to obliterate anything else the speaker says, no matter how meritorious. </p>
<p>Private swim clubs are designed for members to spend their summer days with their families relaxing by the pool. If you take 60 kids of any race without parental supervision, and dump them into any swimming pool all at the same time, the relaxing atmosphere will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Reading between the lines, I&rsquo;m guessing that this pool is facing the same challenge as many private clubs with dwindling memberships. Expenses are rising while memberships are declining. Nobody dares suggest raising dues, so they look for alternative income sources without thinking it through clearly. </p>
<p>On the bright side, it looks like the club will free up some money by firing their spokesman.</p>

		<p>This is actually quite refresahing. Even children can sense the difference between the races. i remember as a kid my parents stopped at a park for us kids to play in but it was full of blacks. None of us wanted to stop. Surprisingly my parents did not really understand. in their day blacks did not get out of line for whites did not tolerate black behavior as they do today.I hope the gentleman in this article realixes that integration is and has always been a mistake.</p>

		<p>Probably more of a business decision on the part of the swimming club than anything. </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to throw away their loyal business on having ghetto thugs-in-training intimidating the regular patrons and trashing the place. Click the link and see the pictures of the &#8220;oppressed day campers&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll know all the details that the article leaves out. </p>

		<p>Telling these kids to go home was a mild reaction compared to the welcome that blacks typically got when they tried to infiltrate white pools in the 1950&rsquo;s. Read Jeff Wiltse&rsquo;s &#8220;Contested Waters&#8221;. Fascinating book. I am amazed at how hard White men fought for their turf back then, and how determinedly  blacks pushed back, even though they knew they weren&rsquo;t wanted in our pools and had pools of their own, in their own neighborhoods. Incidents like those were the impetus for White Flight. If we could have remained socially segregated, I believe Whites would never have left the large cities that we created, and flocked the the &#8216;burbs. Isolating ourselves behind our hedges and picket fences miles away from the (formerly) vibrant city centers has been really bad for American social cohesiveness, bad for &#8220;live&#8221; entertainment, culture, etc. At that same time came TV, and that was the final nail in the coffin of the glory days of White city culture. Interesting to note that every one of the White neighborhood pools that were given up to desegregation back in the early to mid &#8216;50&rsquo;s were closed down within about 4 years, after having been continuously open and serving White city-dwellers for DECADES. </p>

		<p>Most likely their feelings got hurt when white kids left (to avoid more than feelings being hurt). Then, neighborhood kids from all over stood a higher than normal risk of being hurt in response (for either removing possible fun with their favorite pray or just general anger). Probably it even happened (and has been hushed up). Now the Philadelphia pool, staffed no doubt by the appropriately sensitive folks, has to pretend they practice &#8216;segregation&rsquo;, then grovel and cry. More white-guilt, and a convenient target for black rage.</p>

		<p>While I despise racist behavior, it is indeed any person&rsquo;s or property owner&rsquo;s moral right to dictate who will or will not be allowed on their property, for any reason.  </p>
<p>Having said that, I think, as previous posters have observed, that this story is rather thin and light on the facts, and we don&rsquo;t really know what happened.  I would as much suspect that this incident was &#8220;spun&#8221; by the news journalists in order to make it look like a racist incident as I would believe it was not.  Although, that club manager was not impressive in his brief appearance (in the video).  It was he, a white man, who used the word &#8220;axed&#8221; instead of &#8220;asked.&#8221;  Idiot.</p>

		<p>What does the word, &#8220;Private&#8221; mean? It means exclusive to those that pay Membership dues, after being accepted in by the Admission&rsquo;s Board. </p>
<p>Blacks have a problem with Whites having a Private Club or Private pool for their families? </p>
<p>Do these same snot nosed Blacks have a problem with Hollywood-types and other Blacks with money, having their own Clubs, and Garden Parties, on Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard,so as not to have to deal with Whites, which was a story here, not more than a week ago? </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s solve this problem here, right away. I suggest that all American Renaissance readers take a collection to buy tickets for these poor Inner-City Black kids to swim, and spend the Summer at Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, Cape Cod, the Hamptons, and other Snooty Ultra-Rich, Summer Resorts, so they mingle, and add the Joy of Diversity to these Wealthy, Elite areas. </p>

		<p>I was a white person who spent the summers of 2001-2006 swimming in the pools of the Lower East Side in New York.  The pool was surrounded by public housing and their inhabitants were the pools inhabitants.</p>
<p>The amount of external &#8220;structure&#8221; there (to compensate for the lack of internal structure in the household) was unbelievable.  No food, no drink, no street clothes (and they DO check for a liner), nothing allowed on the pool deck but a towel, no goggles, etc etc.  Showers were mandatory.  The city was doing all it could to prevent knifings, shootings &amp; other violence, bottles being thrown, garbage in the pool, &#8220;whirlpooling&#8221; (look it up), sexual assault, etc.  The city had to do for them what they could not do for &#8220;theyselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>You cannot imagine such a scene.  Loud and crowded.  No sense of personal space.  Curly hairs from nasty weaves floating by.  The pool had no deep end, I always figured to prevent murders via drownings.</p>
<p>No one could ever accuse me of being a racist, I swam with inner-city youth.  That&rsquo;s a game of chicken no one here would ever want to take on.</p>

I would like to be able to go to just one place, one safe haven, where all I see and interact with are people who look and act like me- a civilized, educated, racially-aware white person.

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t blame them for getting out of the pool.  One time I had my young son at his school playground with his basketball&hellip;I saw that black kids were starting to play there (I think there was some activity going on at the school), and I told my son that I wanted to go to the store.  Which I did.  So we left.</p>
<p>I hated to cut into his play time, but I also didn&rsquo;t feel like having to watch my back and my son&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>As #13 observed, all the white pools shut down within 4 years of integration. However, the pool in my city is still open and I use it all the time. My city is 95% white. Of course, I moved here from a city that is 75% black. Peace &amp; Quiet. Fresh air. No crime. And to think I only had to take a $30K pay cut to move here. It was worth every freaking penny!!!</p>

		<p>Something similar happened in Utah that I saw 2 years ago. I was working at the Lifetime Fitness in South Jordan. The club is incredibly nice aand, you pay a lot more to go there. Well to make extra money the activities director decided to rent out the Basketball courts to an inner city Basketball league for their games. Man the very first day they were in there we could not sell one membership. The court and, the hallways were full of hooting and, hollering. The families of these mostly black players were causing disruptions everywhere they went being rude to people getting in peoples way there were fights too. I,m sorry but, people do not like b;ack behaviour it is in general appaling. The building was the same however; the feel was entirely different, There was no peace there just a bunch of our members packing up their children and, leaving. After 1 more week someone had the sense to cancel the contract with them. Good riddance they just don,t belong and, no amount of wishing can make it so!</p>

<p>This is a bombshell that is being censored in the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media. New York&rsquo;s first &ldquo;African American&rdquo; senate majority leader celebrated his post by mass firing 200 white workers and replacing them with non-whites.</p>
<p>From New York Postâ€¦</p>
<p>During the first five months of this year, with the Senate under the control of its first African-American majority leader, Smith, top Democrats bemoaned the lack of minority Senate staffers.</p>
<p>But instead of trying to recruit new hires, they fired nearly 200 almost exclusively white workers and replaced them with a large number of minority employees, many of whom were seen by their fellow workers to be unskilled at their new jobs.</p>
<p>The move produced severe racial tensions, made worse by the fact that, as a high-level Democratic staffer confided, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been told to only hire minorities.&rdquo;<br/>

		<p><i>Incidents like those were the impetus for White Flight. If we could have remained socially segregated, I believe Whites would never have left the large cities that we created, and flocked the the &lsquo;burbs.</i> -GoAway</p>
<p>I think there is definitely some truth to that, but it&rsquo;s not the whole story.  After all, some of the biggest suburban hinterlands developed in California, Texas and the Southwest, where black populations were relatively small.  The downtowns of cities which remained overwhelmingly white died too, if more peacefully than places like Detroit and Newark.  And suburbanization had been underway for nearly a decade by the time of Brown v. Board.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at it is that before 1945 there simply wasn&rsquo;t the available wealth for large numbers of whites to leave urban areas.  Blacks and whites were forced to coexist in close proximity, so segregation was a social necessity.  Once the modern suburbs became economically feasible, <i>de jure</i> segregation faded, and <i>de facto</i> segregation (geographic segregation) took its place   &mdash;   more as a reaction to, than than a cause of, the move out of cities.  </p>
<p>When the appeal of physical separation from blacks, as opposed to legal separation from them, was combined with the allure of single-family home ownership, it&rsquo;s no surprise suburbanization took off like it did.  </p>

		<p>Good! Let them break down the walls of all Private clubs, especially the clubs of the White Elites who hide in their Private gated communities. Elites that preach the joys of diversity meanwhile shielding themselves and their offspring from the destruction of forced integration that many promoted, and if they did not promote forced integration, they sat idly as Poor and Middle Class Whites had their areas overtaken by the scourge called diversity.<br/>
 These Elites care nothing for you, especially behind their walls, let the walls come down so they too can feel the Joy! <br/>

		<p>I am typing this so fast because I am stunned by what was just on the tv. I am in the Philadelphia area, and this story was on with the usual shame, shame they all fled when the black kids entered the pool, accompanied by a crying 12 year old making accusations that he OVERHEARD comments.<br/>
But, following this was a local news story about a man attacking and groping teen girls in the city of Philadelphia. They would NOT show the compostite photo on TV. ONe has to go to the website and really search for it. The alleged attacker is BLACK! And you wonder why white folks in the &#8216;burbs near Philadelphia flee when blacks from Philadelphia are around?? The story followed the alleged pool incident immediately! Why did the members of the club flee? Well, the following story answered that question!!! I stopped going into the city years ago. If/when there is an incident against a white person by a black, it is just taken for granted. And you wonder why I live in the &#8216;burbs. I am so sick of stories of violence and such against friends and family who have entered killadelphia. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Most likely their feelings got hurt when white kids left (to avoid more than feelings being hurt).&#8221;</p>
<p>They say it&rsquo;s best to ignore a bully. Running from a bully is very effective too. Simply removing the bullies target, however, does nothing but make the bully angry at missed and deserved opportunity. </p>

		<p>The late breaking news is that Girard College is going to take in all the black kids.  This is so ironic, b/c the college&rsquo;s founder, Stephen Girard, stipulated in his will that the college would only be for poor white boys that were orphans.  The city did everything they could to break his will, and finally succeeded, using the excuse of Federal civil rights laws.</p>

<p>In ghetto-speak that is referred to as &#8220;whirlpooling.&#8221;  Blacks and mestizos are notorious for doing this (usually to White girls).  When they can&rsquo;t find any Whites, their own kind will suffice.</p>

		<p>My town of 25,000 has recently imported several hundred poor Blacks to live in the various new low income apartments the government has built.  <br/>
The nearby skateboard park has been taken over by them, just loitering, being loud, hanging out. Schools have went all to wrong, and just going to the store is aggravating because of their presence.</p>

		<p>This is a very significant issue. To bad nothing will be done to protect the interest of those who wish for free association and like the Jena story it will go unchanllenged.  How are other private group or businesses i.e, NAACP, Girlscouts, Franternities etc., able to deny membership based on race or gender while others are not? The only satisfaction I get from stories like this is when the muslims groups eventually swell to the top, they aren&rsquo;t going to be half as nice about their associations. But nobody will complain much then. <br/>
Sorry, but you&rsquo;ve just been sucker punched, yet again, white man.<br/>

		<p>The grovelling has begun. Go to the Valley Club web site at www.thevalleyclub.com and you can find the hastily-written, unprofessional-looking message which essentially runs up the white flag (no pun intended). One finds the usual pathetic pleading about how much the members love diversity, inclusiveness etc.</p>
<p>I think the white race has just about reached the end of the road.</p>
