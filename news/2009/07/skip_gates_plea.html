<h1>Skip Gates, Please Sit Down</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Ivy League is not real life. {snip} The amenities are better, the rules are flexible, and everyone, student and faculty alike, is well aware that the realities of life as most people know it are merely a peculiar footnote to the day-to-day of campus life. I do not speak out of turn when I say this. I know because I am in and of that world.</p>
<p>As a black Ivy Leaguer, something funny happens as you become ensconced in ivy. You&rsquo;re smart enough to understand that race and racism are a reality you deal with on a daily basis, but you also know that your university ID sets you apart. Does this mean you are kept from hurtful incidents? No, but it is to say that much of the outrage felt at a racial slight is replaced by outrage at a class slight. Sure, we get pissed, knowing we&rsquo;re getting hassled because we&rsquo;re black, but the real indignation comes from being hassled as members of an elite group. How dare you hassle me? I go to school here. I go to work here. That second part of the thought is always present. {snip} When the Ivy League Effect is going full tilt, our black compass gets confused; the realities we know to exist become other people&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} All the lessons about dealing with police as a black person seem to have no place in the ivory tower. We can forget those lessons because, more than we&rsquo;re black in America, we&rsquo;re Ivy Leaguers.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Skip Gates. He isn&rsquo;t outraged because he feels he was the victim of racial profiling by the police (that dubious honor goes to his foolish neighbor) [in fact, the woman who called the police is not a neighbor, but works nearby]. He&rsquo;s outraged because he was the victim of class profiling. He didn&rsquo;t resent being identified as black; he resented being identified as that kind of black, the kind of black that can be hassled and pushed around by simpleton cops. How dare you hassle me? I&rsquo;m Skip Gates: Harvard professor!</p>
<p>Skip has fallen victim to the Ivy League Effect. Check out his articles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. {snip} He all but says, &#8220;Do I look like that type of (black) person? I was wearing a blazer and a polo shirt!&#8221; Gates is Ivy League pissed with a dash of black anger. Not the other way around. {snip}</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also sure the good doctor was talking some shit. The Ivy League Effect, when it&rsquo;s potent, wouldn&rsquo;t allow otherwise. It made Gates forget that, no matter what, even when you&rsquo;re right, you don&rsquo;t talk shit to the police. And that&rsquo;s not a matter of manhood or pride; it&rsquo;s a question of survival. Why? Because you&rsquo;re black before you&rsquo;re a Harvard professor. Because, in an extreme case, you can&rsquo;t tell your side of the story if you get shot reaching for your ID. As a black man and a Harvard professor, Gates&rsquo; thought process should have been: &#8220;Wow. I am so thoroughly pissed right now. When this current situation is resolved and I am out of harm&rsquo;s way, I&rsquo;m going down to the station and I&rsquo;m going to use my considerable influence to make heads roll. But right now, I need to be the smart one, remember all the details and not give him any reason to escalate this situation.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>I remember when I heard about the story, I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking: Wow, that Ivy League Effect has washed out his healthy fear of the police. Yikes.</p>
<p>{snip} But why is he outraged? Because he didn&rsquo;t think the black tax applied to him anymore. In his mind, he was Skip Gates, well-regarded Harvard professor who was being treated poorly in his home by the police. Believe me, if this took place at North Carolina State his sense of indignation would be far different and his ability to garner attention would be much less. And if he was just a working-class stiff? Forget it.</p>
<p>But this didn&rsquo;t happen anywhere else. It happened in Cambridge on Ivy turf and now his story has taken on Paul Bunyan-esque qualities. If you didn&rsquo;t know better, you&rsquo;d think a lynch mob was waiting outside Gates&rsquo; door with the rope and the hitching wagon before Ving Rhames came along and saved the day.</p>
<p>Skip Gates thought that he&rsquo;d worked hard enough, achieved enough, become Harvard enough that this sort of treatment did not apply to him. And now, rather than channel that outrage in a way that is subtle but effective, he&rsquo;s very publicly suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, having &#8220;joined the ranks of the million incarcerated black men in America.&#8221; That&rsquo;s laughable. He does not see those million men as kin and he doesn&rsquo;t, by and large, give a damn about those guys. He&rsquo;s merely annoyed that such an irritation as police misconduct found its way into his home. If he read about this story happening to a plumber in Roxbury, he&rsquo;d shake his head in disappointment and then go on with his life.</p>
<p>So before we heed the call of racism, let&rsquo;s be mindful of the tower from which that call came. This has something to do with race. But it has a lot more to do with messing with Skip Gates.</p>

		<p>Perhaps this is the reason why the black cop who participated in the arrest supported the arrest and not Dr. Gates.  As a generality, cops are none too happy with the elitist college and university culture, both students and faculty.</p>

<p>This enrages me everything I see or hear it.  The neighbor/nearby worker did the right thing.  Do these people, yes I said these people, not understand that their actions are what causes whites and other races to detract from them.  If I saw two black men trying to force open a door on a house nearby, I&rsquo;d call the police, too!!!  They never talk about what they do wrong, it&rsquo;s always someone else is targeting them unfairly.  You notice they never complain about &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; when the cops are looking for a white guy after a slew of &#8220;serial&#8221; murders even though blacks do their own fair share of serial murders these days?  Until THEY get their men under control and their crimes plummets - which is also most crime, all blacks will be viewed with suspicion and resentment and rightfully so!!!  If they want to defend the guilty, then the blowback will continue to be painful.<br>

		<p>Gates is not upset about this incident. He is thrilled. I bet he has been hoping for years that something like this would happen. Now he has a vehicle to promote himself and his views in the broader culture, instead of remaining a cult deity to the few PBS viewers hang on his every word.</p>

		<p>The Salon contributor of this article, like Prof. Gates, presumes too much authority. Rather than one man explaining the other, they are both seen here as self-righteous, overeducated race baiters. They would be surprised how much lip service and how little empathy their colleagues hold for them.<br>

This is essentially the original take I had.</p>
<p>Mr. Gates was likely reacting from the standpoint that he didn&rsquo;t like an ignorant, uppity white boy not knowing he was a &#8220;preeminent&#8221; black scholar. But hey, those blacks at the Chicago cemetery didn&rsquo;t seem to know who Emmit Till was. They must have missed black history month. They get a pass for not knowing black history. Officer Crowley is crucified for not knowing he was standing in the presence of black greatness.</p>
<p>Mr. Gates lives in a elitist enclave of whites. And where did he run off to after this incident? His vacation home in the white elitist enclave of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard.</p>
<p>And talk about racist prejudice:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;I was thinking, this is ridiculous, but I&rsquo;m going to show him my I.D., and this guy is going to get out of my house,&#8221; said Gates. &#8220;This guy had this whole narrative in his head. Black guy breaking and entering.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Apparently Mr. Gates can look at a white man and read the &#8216;narrative&rsquo; in his mind. Is not not prejudice? Is that not a stereotype? Is that not judging someone as a group and not an individual? Is that not judging someone on the color of their skin?</p>
<p>By the way, when did Henry Louis Gates Jr. become &#8216;Skip&rsquo;? I missed that memo.</p>

		<p>I read earlier today on a CNN blog that the woman who reported the door breaking incident couldn&rsquo;t have known the race of the men she was calling about because of the distance and the darkness.  No one was profiling.  Perhaps the professor ought to get to know his neighbors?</p>

<p>How is this racial profiling? If  two stange men of any race, white or black, were attempting to kick in a door of a home, any normal neighborhood reaction would be to call the police as this is suspicious.</p>

		<p>  The real question is would the cops demand ID from a white male? Of course they would. True story. I have an uncommon name. While at work one day,a process server shows up at my house and served my wife with a paternatity notice. Of course it is for another man with the same name. I&rsquo;ve been put over by the police for outstanding warrants. I have been harrassed by bill collectors. I have resolved all this by remaining calm and acted in a civilized manner. Gates could have assumed that the cop was doing his job and behaved in a civil manner; 15 minutes, the cop would have been on his way.</p>

		<p>If this ends badly for the police department, and it could very well do so, it may make other career LEOs think twice or more before arresting a black for ANYTHING! their pay don&rsquo;t change if they arrest one or a thousand people (not that I know of anyway, any police officers to say one way or the other)</p>

		<p>Oh boy, can these people crank it out.</p>
<p>The malfeasance of the officer involved is breezily assumed, worthy of only a passing mention (very clever), and then the debate is which of two white deficiencies was mainly at work, white racism, or (author&rsquo;s choice) &#8220;ivy leaguism,&#8221; with which poor Dr. Gates had allowed himself to become tainted.</p>
<p>A rewrite: </p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Gates, an arrogant member of a typically arrogant group, moved into the ivy league where he felt his status gave him an additional reason to be an arrogant snot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that better, salon.com?</p>

		<p>its pretty basic, someone calls cops, cops find someone in house, cops arent going to leave an unidentified man in a house, cops ask for ID.</p>
<p>For a college prof. not to be able to hold such basic logic is mind bending.</p>

		<p>I think everybody misses the fact that this professor is an AA hire and would not even have been able to get a degree or hired by Harvard if it weren&rsquo;t for the grace of whites who have stupidly decided to pass these people, give them certification and jobs when they aren&rsquo;t qualified.</p>
<p>When the cop asked him to go outside, Gates responded by saying, &#8220;Yo mama.&#8221;  Quite an intellectual, isn&rsquo;t he?  He&rsquo;s no more than ghetto trash.   </p>
<p>The words &#8220;prominent,&#8221; &#8220;scholar,&#8221; learned man,&#8221; all are used to describe this ghetto-talking, race baiting slouch who has shown his gratitude for his many freebies by denouncing whites every chance he gets and trying to whip black mobs into a frenzy, hoping they&rsquo;ll riot in his support.</p>
<p>The topic of conversation on this entire situation should be about this racist black&rsquo;s behavior and uncalled for cries of racism, not whether or not his lying cries of racism are true.  The entire incident makes it plain he&rsquo;s just another black cry baby that will scream racism no matter what the situation.</p>
<p>Notice that EVERY talking black head on T.V. supported this low life.  This is more unequivocal proof that blacks and whites, or blacks and anybody else, will never be able to live together.</p>
<p>These people belong in their own society where their stupidity can only sink themselves, not us with them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad the incident came up, however, because it has given naive whites just one more example of black bias that extends throughout 99% of the community.</p>

		<p>I never understood why McWhorter is considered a conservative. He supported the Jena 6 racists who almost beat a white kid to death, voted for Obama and now assumes that the white cop and the white woman who called the cops are in the wrong and Gates is merely elitist. </p>
<p>The guy is a racist who is maybe 1-2 steps to the right of Gates, Jackson and the rest of his fellow black racists.</p>

SKIP<br>
*****************<br>
In my own PD (in a major metropolis),   sergeants don&rsquo;t make arrests.  Cops do. Nor do sergeants take radio runs   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s what cops are for.   As ranking officers, sergeants are there to supervise their officers.  Thus,  Sgt. Crowley would normally have handed this arrest to a cop, but not gotten directly involved himself.     </p>
<p>I realize that Cambridge is a much smaller city than mine, with possibly different procedures; and probably they coddle the Harvard crowd who expect (and demand) special treatment. </p>
<p>Still, I note that there were at least 4 officers present (in the picture), including at least two (!) sergeants. This response indicates to me that they already sensed they were dealing with a difficult case, or a celebrity with big-time connections  (as Gates bragged), which threatened to become an &#8220;incident&#8221;   &mdash;  -  that, as well as the fact that a sergeant handled the matter <i>personally </i> and took the arrest <i> himself. </i> In my PD this would not be normal procedure. So, it would appear that Gates was already getting special treatment.  (And, in fact, from someone who was considered an expert at inter-racial relations and was a teacher in this field!)</p>

		<p>This event was the pinnacle of &#8220;The Distinguished Black Professor&rsquo;s&#8221; life. He now has had his very own run-in with the racist white-devil cops. You know that every single lecture he gives to his classes, for the rest of his life, will reference this incident. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he turns his couple of hours in the holding tank into a book. </p>

		<p>I have been stoped by the police a few times. I just do as they say. Give them my id, answer their question&hellip;.etc. They soon understand they got the wrong guy, and leave. Instead of working against them, occupy their time. They may have to take me to the station, lock me in. A lot of unnecessary work and wasted time.<br>
In the meanwhile the real rascal goes free!<br>

		<p>There should be a law that criminalize a person or group  claiming and shouting racism. Even more so if it is found to be a false claim. It shoud be the same as a person making a fake &#8220;bomb&#8221; call or threat&hellip; Although it is actually worse as in the case of a racism cry, true or false, the lives, property and safety of all whites in the vicinity and even elsewhere, are endangered!</p>
<p>The racism shouters are out to incite violence against whites and if it is a false claim it is also purgery! <br>
The so-called &#8220;poor black victims&#8221; of racism and the malicious white liberals supporting them, are nothing else than individuals and groups trying their best to organize an undeserved advantage for themselves and could not care less if other inocent people are attacked verbally or physically because of their selfish and opportunistic falshoods and the resultant actions and abuses! </p>
<p>Both Obama and the fake racism caller Gates, should be sued for compensation running into millions.</p>
<p>I hope this white cop has the balls, common sense and foresight to force realism via the courts unto all blacks and unto all those malicious race traitor white liberals!</p>
<p>As the white hating Obama lifted his mask a little and you white Americans could peek in there for a moment, I hope you recognized &#8220;mr death of white America&#8221;, at last. Use his indiscretion to unmask him for what he is! Support this white cop and do it now!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sure, we get pissed, knowing we&rsquo;re getting hassled because we&rsquo;re black, but the real indignation comes from being hassled as members of an elite group. How dare you hassle me? I go to school here. I go to work here.&#8221;</p>
<p>I assume he&rsquo;s talking about cops hassling him.  If his fellow academics/students/staff give him a hard time, you can bet it&rsquo;s based on his personality, &amp; professionalism or lack thereof, &amp; not on race.  Some of the black academics where I work carry a chip the size of a redwood tree on their shoulders; others you simply learn to steer away from for practical reasons.  They can be as indignant as they want, as long as I don&rsquo;t have to listen.</p>

		<p>The author is another race baiter.  For the life of me I wish this overeducated priveleged snob would actually define &#8220;racism&#8221; and how he is affected by &#8220;racism.&#8221;  We dig deep here we will I believe come to understand that &#8220;racism&#8221; to blacks is a metaphysical reaction to being around whites and not being white themselves.  When we whites are targeted for the racist canard we instinctually start thinking of police dogs and water cannons.  AR studies race differences so this view of what &#8220;racism&#8221; is might make a good study in itself.  There never seems to be an end of stories of blacks and their superstitous beliefs and I think in most instances this racism charge is another phony religion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, we get pissed, knowing we&rsquo;re getting hassled because we&rsquo;re black&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Give me a break! At what Ivy League university does this happen? If you ask me, this is just typical black behavior of being quick to take offense and having a chip on their shoulder, most definitely because they they well know that their success is completely dependent on the good graces of white people, the people they hate so much.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re smart enough to understand that race and racism are a reality you deal with on a daily basis, but you also know that your university ID sets you apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>This entire essay is filled with thoughts that appear to come from a high school kid.  It&rsquo;s just plain dumb.  The man is definitely not a thinker.  But, then again, how could he be?  He&rsquo;s black and has some serious problems with abstract thinking and drawing logical conclusions.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does not see those million men as kin and he doesn&rsquo;t, by and large, give a damn about those guys.&#8221; (Referring to one million blacks in prison.)</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s stupidly telling his readers that all blacks should regard each other as kin, not realizing that he&rsquo;s giving us an example of his racism, the same kind that whites have to deal with on a daily basis.  How unintelligent.  And humorous too, because he makes the case that AA certification is no more than a worthless piece of paper.</p>
<p>Blacks DO NOT deal with racism and oppression on a daily basis.  They deal with freebies and privileges on a daily basis.<br>
They scream racism in order to justify their incompetence and lack of intelligence that keeps them from earning success on their own.  It&rsquo;s far more soothing to their egos to pretend that their many failures are whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>Every race in America outperforms them.  That&rsquo;s the one big elephant in the room nobody seems to notice or wants to talk about.</p>

		<p>If I were a black professional I would be embarrassed how Gates behaved.  If a black professor like him, who is so eminent and educated, can act like this(a ghetto thug), what does that say about the average black and their mentality.  No wonder blacks have such a bad image around the world.  Don Lemon, a black reporter for CNN, interviewed a black female officer from Sgt. Crowley&rsquo;s department.  She stated she voted for Obama, but would never vote for him again. <br>

		<p>There are plenty of good posts here especially the one by &#8220;q&#8221; who hit the nail right on the head.  So let me interject a different aspect of this whole situation.  This event is so insignificant that it should have barely made the news in a local paper. However the liberal propaganda media gets their little paws on it and blows it all out of proportion on a nationwide basis by using &#8220;the race card&#8221; in an effort to keep the racial hatred going between blacks and whites and then the right wing media has to get involved in order to defend the cops. But this time it backfired, Obama as clueless as usual got all caught up in the propaganda and made a total fool out of himself.  Keep up the good work liberal media, your doing a great job!        </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;I never understood why McWhorter is considered a conservative.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I first learned about McWhorter when he was on c-span promoting a book about black social pathology to a bookstore full of blacks. He told them, in no uncertain terms, that they were responsible for how they acted and how they were perceived. The blacks crucified him.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right. He has seemed to have moved to the side of making excuses for blacks. Listening to him and reading his work, he can be all over the issue. He now seems to be saying, &#8216;yes blacks have their issues but white people have to be aware, if not sensitive to black matters&rsquo;.

		<p>The sooner everyone realizes the hatred that blacks have for whites the sooner they will understand the actions and reactions of Gates and Obama. If you have only a few drops of African blood you can escape the hatred and join in for special privileges. Soledad O&rsquo;Brien is a good example of this, she has no African features and maybe one sixteen of African blood but claims full rights and privileges.</p>

		<p>All the above. I just want to clarify; some of the posts refer to &#8220;Black professionals&#8221;. Actually, what we have with Gates and the NWA who wrote the piece, are &#8220;Professional Blacks&#8221;. These are guys who are Ivy League Jesse Jackson/Al Sharpton. Just look better, dress more upper middle class. But part of the same race hustler/affirmative action/Diversity machine. <br>
I have no problem with Black professionals (the police sergeant involved here, say). It is just the Gates type that annoys me; without AA, this guy would probably be a low level manager at a McDonalds or something, supervising Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. </p>

		<p>      All of Black America speaks as one on this issue: we are victims. Obama changes nothing. Not only Obama, but Massachusetts has a Black Governor and Cambridge a Black Mayor. Yet still they pull the victim card. When they talk about equality it&rsquo;s obvious they are only considering the goodies, never the duties-the duties of pulling their weight and giving up the victim card. No, they just don&rsquo;t have the moral gravitas to be part of a great civilization, even the few who have the requisite intellect.</p>

		<p>There has been quite a lot of emphasis on the fact that that Gates character works as a Harvard professor, right?</p>
<p>Well, I live in a place (province of Québec, Canada) where there is no such thing as Affirmative Action for Blacks in our school system (that I know of, anyway); and I have personnally come to the conclusion, that in a the case of a black person, in the U.S., an Ivy League diploma or status as a professor in one of those prestigious universities, simply proves absolutely nothing!</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s true: we&rsquo;re talking about Blacks who get admitted to such universities, while they wouldn&rsquo;t have one chance in a zillion were it not for their skin color!</p>
<p>Those same black people who unfairly got admitted to such institutions, get diplomas because white teachers are afraid that if they sink them, they will be sued.</p>
<p>And then, those «token» Ivy League graduates get jobs through Affirmative Action (AGAIN!), and later prove themselves to be just mediocre in their occupation&hellip; Think Michelle Obama, or Sonia Sotomayor, or&hellip; Mister Affirmative Action himself, your new president, Barack Hussein Obama; the man who can&rsquo;t pronounce more than two consecutive words without his teleprompter!</p>

<p>The recent figure is roughly 600 a year over the last 20 years.  Before civil rights and during the time in which the US population was smaller it was obviously less.  I would say about 30,000 or so during that time, which is probably double of the number of blacks who have been killed by whites. </p>
