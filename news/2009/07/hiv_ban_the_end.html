<h1>HIV Ban: The End Is in Sight</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Immigration Equality, July 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has just published proposed regulations that will soon eliminate the HIV travel and immigration ban once and for all. Once finalized, the regulations will remove HIV from the list of &#8220;communicable diseases of public health significance.&#8221; Once HIV is removed from this list, the HIV ban, which has lasted over two decades will finally come to an end.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We still have a couple of procedural hurdles to clear, but the end is definitely in sight. None of this would have been possible without the leadership of Senator John Kerry, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and former Senator Gordon Smith, who led the fight in Congress last year to remove the statutory HIV ban. Immigration Equality has also convened a broad-based coalition that has continued to push for full equality under U.S. immigration law for people living with HIV.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Our nation is broke.  We may have to reduce Social Security payments to our elderly and increase college costs to our young.  It can cost over 2 million Dollars to treat a single HIV-infected individual, once the disease progresses to full-blown AIDS.  Who will pay for this?  Are you willing to have your children forgo a college education or to place your parents in dire poverty so that AIDS-infected Mexicans or Nigerians can come soak up massive amounts of free medical care in the USA?  </p>
<p>The USA can no longer take care of the entire world.  L.A. is bankrupt.  California is bankrupt.  The USA is bankrupt.  It is time that Mexico and Nigeria and all other nations of the world assumed responsibility for their own citizens.  The USA can no longer afford it.</p>

		<p><i>While HIV infection is a serious<br/>
health condition, it does not represent a<br/>
communicable disease that is a<br/>
significant threat for introduction,<br/>
transmission, and spread to the U.S.<br/>
population through casual contact.</i></p>
<p><br/>
Strictly speaking, this is true, but from a policy standpoint it&rsquo;s insane.  HIV infected persons are at risk for opportunistic infections, and may well pose a threat to others due to infections, like TB.  HIV infected people are often uneducated and poor.  Once here these people will suck up public health care at a very high rate.  Also, with the exception of a small minority (the few infected from transfusions), their disease is always associated with regressive behavior (drug abuse and/or sexual promiscuity/perversion).  Something in this doesn&rsquo;t smell right.  I&rsquo;m wondering if what we are seeing is an Obama inspired &#8220;back door&#8221; ploy to get more Africans into the US?</p>

		<p>Apparently the HIV rate among blacks isn&rsquo;t high enough for our government. Once we pass socialized medicine millions HIV+ Africans will migrate here to receive life extending treatment (courtesy of the taxpayers) that way they will live long enough to pass HIV on to the host country&rsquo;s population. Even without the obvious race component, this is insane public policy.</p>

		<p>Just shows how stupid almost all black and gay politicians are.  The vast majority (world-wide) of HIV positive people are black followed by gay men.  The last thing anyone with any sense would want would be foreigners coming in to the US to infect your brethren.  Not to mention bankrupting our health care system.<br/>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen many news stories of foreign born people with HIV infecting people. In some countries they are charged with a crime if they don&rsquo;t tell their partner their HIV condition. We see these stories at AmRen quite often. Before they change the immigration rules, they should calculate the number of people who are getting infected. Also calculate the future medical costs.</p>

		<p>It may be true that it is not transmitted by casual contact, but who is going to believe all HIV+ people are going to strictly keep their hands off anybody else? </p>
<p>And of course they are not going to go back to the third world trash heap countries they came from when they can get taxpayer subsidized free medical care up until the time the disease finally does them in, maybe in 10-15 years. (translation: mucho taxpayer $$$, so be prepared to fork it over)</p>
<p>I am a white immigrant who came here at the age of 12 and I recall our family having to go get a chest X-ray and other medical tests before the US would qualify us for immigration.</p>
<p>It is a sad commentary on the state of affairs in this country that they no longer stick to a higher standard and let in only the better quality immigrants who are not on the fast track to being on the public dole once they get here. </p>
<p>People are watching what is happening to California as a result of 40 years of liberal Democrat lunacy running the state. The US is next in line. Maybe that is what we need: a total meltdown to bring us back to our senses, but first the brutal pain has to be suffered when the welfare state collapses. This HIV immigration thing is simply another nail in our collective coffin.</p>

		<p>Insane.  So AIDS is no longer a &#8220;communicable disease of public health significance&#8221;?  The real point is to let any African with AIDS come here and get &#8220;free&#8221; health care courtesy of the American tax payer, while having sex with clueless white American women, who have been indoctrinated by our media to believe it is &#8220;racist&#8221; to reject the advances of a black man.</p>

		<p>Being the eternal optimist I will just say that this may work to our advantage as the Black populations will be the hardest hit by HIV, followed closely behind by homosexuals (no pun intended).</p>
<p>In Africa, the population in countries with high HIV rates has stabilised and in some cases decreased. Lesotho is the hardest hit by HIV and their population growth rate is 0.116%. Second is Swaziland with a growth rate of -0.23%, which now has more deaths than births, largely due to HIV.</p>

		<p>Please excuse this comment if it seems a bit disjointed. I have several points to make, this article has made me quite angry and I&rsquo;m not really all that concerned at the moment with making a perfectly fluid post. That being said:<br/>
If HIV/AIDS is no longer considered a &ldquo;communicable disease of public health significance&rdquo; can we finally stop pouring money into finding the elusive cure? Also if it is NOT a &ldquo;communicable diseases of public health significance&rdquo; can we now please be spared the disgusting sob stories of the HIV AIDS &#8220;health crisis&#8221; that seems tragically target all these poor minorities?<br/>
If it is no longer considered a  &ldquo;communicable diseases of public health significance&rdquo; just shut the @#$&* up about it already and leave the promiscuous &#8220;down low&#8221; dope using african americans to wallow happily in this virus they seem to have such an affintiy for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before that I am married to a White Russian immigrant. I don&rsquo;t think I have to explain the hoops this clean, healthy, university educated, law abiding man had to go through to come to this country and after being here legally for 4 years, furthering his education at HIS expense, staying healthy, working hard, speaking fluent English, paying taxes, etc. etc. the hoops he has to jump through and the exhorbitant amount of money paid to this government (like a $300 influenza shot he has to get every year from the govt.-not an $8 vaccine at the local CVS drug store, mind you-until he gets his permanent resident ID (green card) and the tens of thousands to an immigration attorney is enough to make you want to tear at your hair.</p>
<p>And for what, you may ask? <br/>
You know what? WE CAN&rsquo;T FIGURE IT OUT OURSELVES ANYMORE!!!<br/>
Every day that we see more Somalis, Sudanese, Chechen Muslims (ALL Catholic Charities &#8220;refugee asylum&#8221; cases) flooding into our once white neighbourhood, trashing the place, going to the bathroom in the street-(and no, I am not making that part up, it&rsquo;s a regular occurance in a Catholic Charities area)  lining up at the supermarket with the foodstamp card, shouting into expensive cell phones in every language imaginable while in line at the pharmacy, probably picking up their HIV AIDS medications at the expense of our generous tax dollars, we ask ourselves why didn&rsquo;t he just go back to Russia and I go with him.</p>
<p>Now the AIDS masses. <br/>
I have tried my hardest to be a loyal, patrotic American but this is no longer the United States. I don&rsquo;t know what it is anymore. And, frankly, I don&rsquo;t care if anyone calls me &#8220;unAmerican&#8221;. If this is what America is, I don&rsquo;t know if I can tolerate it much longer. I&rsquo;m sorry to all who have fought for this country, lost their lives for this country or served in any way, shape or form. Sincerely, I am sorry. Sorry for the third world toilet this place is becoming at a dizzyingly exponential rate.</p>
<p>I have an idea- <br/>
Bring &#8216;em ALL here. Let them have this health care, this stinking lefty government. Let them have it all. Clean out Africa completely and bring them all here. Every single last one of them. Give us Africa and let us (and by US I mean US. Sane White People) start our own monochromatic utopia. The resources are vast and we are resourceful. We are doctors, farmers, chemists, engineers, nurses, care-givers, teachers, writers, on and on. <br/>
I can&rsquo;t take it anymore. <br/>
IF this raving comment gets posted, I thank the wonderful moderators here. Thank you for letting me vent to such a degree. I needed. God bless You All, brothers and sisters.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what a person&rsquo;s race is, if one has a communicable disease and HIV is a communicable disease, then those with HIV  shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to immigrate as they will be a public health burden. We can&rsquo;t even afford to take care of our own people, much less inviting those in with expensive diseases.</p>

Just in time for universal health care.</p>
<p>Once these and the millions of others cross our borders, they&rsquo;re going to claim their &#8216;human right&rsquo; to health care.</p>
<p>Soon after, I&rsquo;ll be watching members of the congressional black caucus on c-span saying &#8216;how can we, as a caring, moral people, deny anyone access to health care. That would be immoral, unethical, and inhuman. Are we going to continue as a nation who gave us slavery or a nation that provides the dying with aid, comfort, and hope?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thanks for the response but I am no friend of Communism.  It&rsquo;s a long article but will read it later.</p>
<p>I should have clarified the statement better.  I don&rsquo;t really believe capitalism is bad but in a society that has no morals and ethics like the U.S. (both which would be a check and balance system for capitalism or any other governing theory), it destroys.  We have unbridled capitalism that has rotted and consumed the entire system.  And we have a populace that is too ignorant, too dumb-downed, too self-obsessed, and too hooked on instant gratification to see reality.  When a society allows business to harm a country and its citizens with &#8220;it&rsquo;s a business decision&#8221; without question or outrage, it gets what it deserve.  We&rsquo;re all guilty, not just the thieves and liars in control.<br/>

		<p>I agree. I believe capitalism, imperfect though it is, is the best system, better than communism, socialism etc. as it has a greater allowance for the talented and sucessful to achieve. However, capitalism must be controlled, not allowed to run out amuck, which is what has happened in the USA. As was said above, business should work in line with national interest, not allowed to harm it with unbridled greed, which is what has happened here. True capitalism is when a nation, using its&rsquo; own resources and its&rsquo; own citizens as employees, manufactures and produces its&rsquo; own products, creates its&rsquo; own inventions etc. and freely buys and trades with other nations doing the same. Unbridled capitalism has given us globalism, outsourcing of jobs and insourcing of cheaper foreigners, which benefits a samll amount of elites but has severely hurt the USA as a whole and will destroy it if allowed to continue.</p>
