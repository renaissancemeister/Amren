<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal prosecutors in North Carolina accused six U.S. citizens and a permanent resident Monday of conspiring to provide material support to foreign terrorists and to commit murder overseas. The charges come as part of a long-running investigation into Raleigh area men who stockpiled a cache of assault weapons.</p>
<p>At the center of the ring is Daniel P. Boyd, 39, who trained in terrorist camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the 1980s before fighting the Soviet Union, authorities said. Boyd, a Muslim convert, returned home and three years ago allegedly began recruiting a group of men to wage jihad.</p>
<p>Also known as &#8220;Saifullah,&#8221; or sword of God, Boyd raised money to send his acolytes on a visit to the Middle East, according to an indictment handed up by a grand jury last week and unsealed Monday.</p>
<p>Authorities picked up no sign of communications between Boyd and al-Qaeda or any plans by the Raleigh group to wreak havoc, according to a law enforcement source who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation continues. But the weapons that the group had allegedly amassed and brandished in training exercises in North Carolina this June and July gave pause to federal officials, the source added.</p>
<p>The firearms mentioned in the indictment include several semiautomatic weapons, including an AK-47 assault rifle and carbines modeled after the military&rsquo;s M14 and M16.</p>
<p>Several of the defendants traveled to the Gaza Strip, Jordan and Israel in 2006 and 2007, as conflict in the region escalated, the indictment said. {snip} But most defendants appear to have been turned away from the fighting and did not inflict casualties, according to court papers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Members of the group &#8220;radicalized&#8221; younger converts to believe that &#8220;violent jihad was a personal obligation on the part of every good Muslim,&#8221; the indictment said. The defendants, who include Boyd&rsquo;s sons Zakariya and Dylan, could all face life imprisonment if convicted.</p>
<p>The name of at least one other defendant appeared to be redacted in the indictment. A search is ongoing, another government official said.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Tom Leonard, Telegraph (London), July 28, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A white American dry-walling contractor and his two sons ran a military-style training camp in North Carolina while plotting &#8220;violent jihad&#8221;, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Despite leading an unobtrusive life in a rural part of the southern state, Daniel Boyd was the ringleader of a group preparing for terror attacks in countries including Israel and Jordan, it was claimed.</p>
<p>Mr Boyd, 39, is alleged to have roots in Muslim extremism stretching back decades and is among seven people to have been charged with planing attacks.</p>
<p>US officials said he was in Pakistan and Afghanistan from 1989 to 1992, training in terrorist camps and fighting the Soviets in their final years of the Afghan occupation.</p>
<p>Returning to America, he allegedly set up his own training and fund-raising organisation and recruited his two sons  &mdash;  Zakriya, 20, and Dylan, 22.</p>
<p>They and four other men were arrested on Monday and face various charges of providing material support for terrorism and &#8220;conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure persons abroad&#8221;.</p>
<p>They have yet to plead but, if convicted, they face life sentences.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, who have not given details of the group&rsquo;s targets, said the men were watched by the FBI for three years until this month.</p>
<p>During that time, they allegedly trained with assault weapons and tried to raise money for others willing to take part in terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Mr Boyd and some of the others travelled to Israel in June 2007 intending to wage &#8220;violent jihad&#8221; but returned home without success, said prosecutors.</p>
<p>Mr Boyd, the alleged ringleader, held prayer meetings at his home after breaking with his local mosque earlier this year because its views were allegedly too moderate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The defendants prepared themselves to engage in violent jihad and were willing to die as martyrs,&#8221; said the US Justice Department.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past three years, Boyd has conspired with others in this country to recruit and help young men travel overseas in order to kill,&#8221; said David Kris, an assistant attorney general.</p>
<p>Mr Boyd lived south of the state capital, Raleigh, where he ran a family drywall business.</p>
<p>Investigators said that Mr Boyd and his brother were convicted of a bank robbery in Pakistan in 1991.</p>
<p>Pakistani authorities said the pair were carrying identification showing they belonged to a radical Afghan guerrilla group called Hezb-e-Islami, or Party of Islam.</p>
<p>They were each sentenced to lose a foot and a hand for the robbery but the punishment was later overturned.</p>
<p>At the time, his American wife, Sabrina, said that the brothers had become Muslims nine years earlier.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say it was unclear when the Boyds returned to the US and they have not yet revealed how they first suspected them.<br>

It&rsquo;s like these guys come out of central casting.</p>
<p>He did what he did. He made the choices he made. However, I have to wonder if somewhere along the line, someone was egging him on or facilitating his travel.</p>
<p>Real or manufactured, it doesn&rsquo;t matter; he either did it on his own or took the bait. In the end, he brings shame to our race. That alone should be a crime.</p>

		<p>&#8220;breaking with his local mosque earlier this year because its views were allegedly too moderate.&#8221;</p>
<p>After my shallow dive into the Quran, it is obvious that the &#8220;moderates&#8221; are the ones not towing the Jihad line.</p>
<p>For example:<br>
&#8220;Truly Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure,&#8221; (Surah 61:4). </p>
<p>&#8220;Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress limits&hellip;191 And slay them wherever ye catch them. and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for persecution is worse than slaughter; But fight them not at the sacred Mosque unless they (first) fight you there; But if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who reject faith. 192 But if they cease, Allah is oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. 193And fight them on until there is no more persecution. And the religion becomes Allah&rsquo;s. But if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression&#8221; (The Qur&rsquo;an, Surah 2:190-193)<br>
 <br>
&#8220;O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter.  Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For Allah hath power over all things,&#8221; (Surah 9:38-39). </p>
<p>See also Surah 4:74-76; 61:10-12. </p>
<p>Islam, the religion of peace&hellip;right.</p>

		<p>I often say &#8220;you can&rsquo;t blame a dog for barking,&#8221; or use some other such homespun adage, to explain the behavior of the darker types whose misdeeds and vulgarities are chronicled on these pages.  They are what they are.  </p>
<p>I hold whites to a higher standard, which is why I find the &#8220;Wigger&#8221; types the most loathsome people I see and the jungle fever white women beneath contempt.  This traitor and his sadly deracinated children are shameful and I hope they get the maximum punishment, but it pains me to see a white man stray so far from the path. </p>

		<p>The love of Islam just keeps giving. Boyd must be a crack pot to believe Islam holds the answers. This is what happens when the US Govt. allows muslims into the US and their bad qualities have rubbed onto an American. As many have commented, the liberal Marxist media will have a field day and portray whites just as bad as muslims which is just plain propaganda.</p>

<p>As a teenager!  (Do the arithmetic.)  So what&rsquo;s an American teen (aapparently pulled from the cast of <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i>, no less) doing over in the Pashtun paradise during the Reagan years?  We weren&rsquo;t <i>that</i> anticommunist, were we?</p>
<p><br>
<i> &hellip;and recruited his two sons &mdash; Zakriya, 20, and Dylan, 22.</i></p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s busy siring kids in his teens, as well.  (Who are their mothers?)  </p>
<p>My rule-of-thumb: anyone who names a kid &#8220;Dylan&#8221; is to be presumed mentally disturbed until proven otherwise.  Genuine Welshmen excepted, of course.  And the Dylans themselves will have problems of their own.  Look at Columbine High.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t like radical muslims and i don&rsquo;t think islamic beliefs should be pushed, praised or allowed in our schools or on the media. I&rsquo;m against immigration from muslim nations. They don&rsquo;t fit with our culture.Muslim efforts to attack US traditions should be vigorously rebutted.  </p>
<p>But these NC dopes didn&rsquo;t do anything that justifies prosecution. Authentic patriotic groups could be next if this bunch is convicted for practicing use of firearms.</p>
<p> Excuse me, but possession of the weapons they had should be legal under the Second Amendment. IF they had a fantasy about jihad, there is nothing to be done about  it, unlesss they took steps to launch an attack. If anything, they went out of their way not to actually attack anyone here or abroad. </p>
<p>My concern here is that the Obama Administration will use this odd crew as an excuse to crack down on Americans&rsquo; right of possession of automatic and semiautomatic weapons. Patriots(not the muslims) someday may have to defend themselves against tyrannical government, as was true in 1775 at Concord.</p>
<p>All very odd. I am convinced someday we will have muslim terrorism again in America, this time by muslim &#8216;citizens&rsquo;. At that point liquidate anyone involved, including accessories.</p>
<p>But this almost comic incident is not the attack that surely will come someday from a far more competent gang of muslim loonies.</p>

		<p>I read in another article that this guy fought the Soviets alongside the Mujahideen back in the 1980&rsquo;s.  So twenty years ago, this guy&rsquo;s a Cold War hero.  So far all that&rsquo;s come out is that this guy:</p>
<p>1.  Is a White Muslim<br>
2.  Has some controversial ideas<br>
3.  Owns guns <br>
4.  Did some training drills</p>
<p>Items two through three probably fit with a lot of people who would never commit terrorism.  Unless there&rsquo;s more to come out, the AG is pushing thought crimes.</p>

		<p>11 Reg: I knew a good ol boy in the service named Dylan.  It was just a Southern name.  Of course, he was born long before anyone had heard of Robert Zimmerman, and decided to show their hipness by naming their kid &#8220;Dylan&#8221;.  Nothing wrong with &#8220;Dylan&#8221;, just something wrong with parents who burden their kids with celebrities&rsquo; stage names.  That&rsquo;s what dogs&rsquo; names are for.</p>

		<p>      Well this fellow is disgusted with America and the West as they exist under the New World Order. He was probably enarmoured with the Afghans who are a simple, fierce, and in their way, a noble people. As the other poster said, he must have been profoundly alienated. And I don&rsquo;t blame him a bit for that, so am<br>
I and so are most of you. But he has chosen the wrong path, an alien path and an alien religion. Even if we gain our freedom from our oppressors, we will still probably have to fight the Muslims some day. This type of thing has happened before-the slave soldiers of Islam were famously fierce and effective-the Mamelukes of medevial Egypt and later, the Turkish Janissaries. The Mamelukes even defeated the Mongols.</p>

Black Muslims giving with violent agendas are a significant group in this country. And yet<br>
we hear nothing about them..but this guy a white muslim jihadi..represents nothing but himself.But one thing he does do is serve Leftist propaganda purposes and so he is spread all<br>

		<p>Doing the bidding of the ADL and the SPLC who have their people on her staff, Janet Napolitano declared tea party protestors, and ordinary American citizens terrorists, but not once has she, or the SPLC or the ADL, sounded the alarm to beware of the MANY jihadists we have in this country who are in actual training and those who listen weekly to their Imams preach jihad in their mosques.</p>
<p>The ADL and SPLC have went even further into nut case conspiracies and declared that Pat Buchanan, Lou Dobbs, the Minutemen, and various other anti-illegal alien protestors to be terrorists and haters.</p>
<p>Both these groups are politically motivated trouble-makers of the worst kind, and, since their political motivations are strictly political, it is criminal for the IRS to allow them tax exempt status.  In their quest for revenue the government would be quite wise to begin taxing them as well as the ACLU which also pursues a political ideology.  Much revenue could be obtained from them at a time when the country is sinking incrementally into an economic catastrophe.  Trying to put a happy face on a couple of barely positive figures in no way means a thing in the larger scheme of things. The economic plummet is continuing.  These organizations have political agendas and should be heavily taxed.  It would help some, especially if they would triple the tax rate on Hollywood.</p>

		<p>If you can&rsquo;t believe the Federal government, well by golly who can you trust!  I am always wary of any charges against a white man who is dissatisfied with the Federal government and it&rsquo;s policies.  This has all the appearances of a sham allegation to imply that White people who are opposed to the policies of the government are on par with middle eastern terrorists. Think about it.  Since when has the government been a trustworthy source of information?  It seems clear that darn near all of us are potential terrorists now.  NEVER believe anything the government tells you. ANYTHING</p>

<p>Someone tell me, I&rsquo;m curious about this translation. Is it done to convert Christians and Westerners who have been raised on the language of the King James NT and Shakespeare?   &mdash;  Whiteplight</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably &#8220;Mohammed&#8221; Marmaduke Pickthall&rsquo;s.  He was an Englishman who converted. His 1930 <i>Meaning of the Glorious Koran</i> was the first translation by an English-speaking Mohammedan, so it has &#8220;squatter&rsquo;s rights&#8221; of a sort, but it also has been criticized for just this sort of language. Most other translations are in more modern English.  (It&rsquo;s called &#8220;Meaning&#8221; because the Koran by law only exists in Arabic.)</p>
<p>Maybe Pickthall was nostalgic for the Jacobean spirit. </p>

		<p>In a way, I don&rsquo;t blame him. Our White elites, academia and the government, especially the judiciary and now even the medical system are out to destroy us just as Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin destroyed the Kulaks.</p>
<p>The only reason I have a job is that I checked &#8220;black&#8221;, not White on my application.  I have survived several lay offs in the last 20 years.  I doubt it is because of my good job performance, it is because the computer keeps me in the &#8220;black don&rsquo;t lay off&#8221; file.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an amateur historian.  Look up the history of English and Irish Catholics from 1535 to 1832 for the English and 1940 for the Irish.  Read the history of communism and its massacre of more than 200 million of its own citizens in China, Russian and the eastern European Nations.  That is what the liberals and elites have in store for us.</p>
<p>There is nothing we can do about it.  There are not enough of us to even raise consciousness.  Our women, especially the high IQ women and the brainwashed commies who run the school and university system have betrayed us.</p>
<p>We, the racially conscious Whites who know what is in store for us cannot fight against our own leviathan of a government and the wealthiest people in the world.  They have the entire population of asia, africa, latin america and the middle east to use as storm troopers against us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted this before and I&rsquo;ll post it again.  If you have children the only way you can insure college admission and any kind of employment, not just a decent job, but any kind of job for them is to change their last names to very common hispanic ones before they enter high school.</p>
<p>With average White IQ and grades they will be recruited into the best colleges with full scholarships beginning in their junior year of high school.  They will have good jobs offered to them in their last year of college.  If they want to open their own business they will be deluged with offers of loans from the SBA and every bank in town.</p>
<p>If they stay White they will end up as untouchables, banned from employment and soon even welfare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sauve qui peut&#8221;  Save yourself if you can.  It is the old French army order to be used in a disastrous loss in battle.</p>
<p>The other thing is, what do we owe to Whites as a race?  I say nothing. Whites have done this to us.  Whites are even now lobbying congress to cut off medical care for Whites over age 55.</p>
<p>Whites have placed black criminals in decent White neighborhoods for 80 years now and cheered as Whites were terrorized, murdered, raped and robbed by black criminals who operated with the full approval and encouragement from the Judiciary.</p>
<p>White employers would rather employ rain forest people from their villages in remote areas of S. america  who don&rsquo;t speak even a work of spanish, let alone english rather than employ an American</p>
<p>We are on our own.</p>

		<p>Interesting that they have arrested one of the few White Americans instead of the tens of thousands of black muslims with lengthy felon records who run similiar training camps.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a black muslim camp in upstate New York that has been operating for decades?</p>

<p>My mind keeps going back to Randy Weaver.  Guess the ADL SPLC ahs realized that the neo nazi gravy train is dead and gone, so they are now setting up White muslim groups instead of the white neo nazi groups they formerly used to raise their 2 million dollar per year salaries.<br>

<p>You placed the argument very well.  For the last twenty or so years I saw reasonable whites struggle to slow, stop, and reverse the disasters you mentioned and others.</p>
<p>Sadly nothing worked. The problems grow worse as the number of common sense white voters proportionally diminish. If the disaster couldn&rsquo;t be stopped with a white population at 80 percent, it can&rsquo;t be stopped with a white population of 60 percent.   </p>
<p>Like you I blame my fellow white people for these problems. About half of whom are content to condemn themselves to be second or third class citizens. These worshipers of black sports &#8220;heroes&#8221;, cool fads, Hollywood trends,and consumerism have condemned the rest of us too.  </p>
<p>These are the fools who willingly sell themselves and their kids into slavery to support ghetto and third world societies.  To them  it is just find to have a Kenyan as president who will openly stuff anti-white trolls into agencies who will dig in for a lifetime of destruction to white interest. Our brain dead fellow whites are seemingly find with the many anti-white laws that are coming down the pike that will rob them of any wealth they may have to pay &#8220;reparations&#8221;. </p>
<p>Much is made of the Jews in WWII who willingly walking away to their doom with little protest or fight.  This has been properly condemned by us.  But how are we different?  Murder of Jews went on daily, weekly and yearly.  The war on whites by blacks goes on in this country, daily, weekly, and yearly.  How are we different? </p>
<p>Well, one might say that the murder of Jews was government policy and ours is not.  On this you would be wrong. </p>
<p>Blacks, Hispanics and other third world groups on average hold race as the first loyalty.  They could care less about democracy, western legal precepts, fair play, and European traditions and history.  </p>
<p>So&hellip;.what happens now?  Do we go the way of South Africa, Brazil, of simply fade away? </p>
