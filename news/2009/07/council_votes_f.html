<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/nyregion/01muslim.html?_r=2&amp;emc=eta1">Council Votes for Two Muslim School Holidays</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kirk Semple, New York Times, July 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Spurred by a broad coalition of religious, labor and immigrant groups, the City Council overwhelmingly passed a resolution on Tuesday to add two of the most important Muslim holy days to the public schools&rsquo; holiday calendar.</p>
<p>But the vote, which was nonbinding, put the Council in conflict with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has the final say to designate the days off and has said he is resolutely opposed to the idea.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The current school calendar recognizes major Christian and Jewish holy days like Christmas and Yom Kippur, but no Muslim holy days.</p>
<p>Mr. Bloomberg&rsquo;s stance has irritated advocates of the measure, and some said he risked alienating many in New York&rsquo;s fast-growing Muslim population as he seeks re-election in the fall.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care what Mayor Bloomberg is risking. He sure as hell didn&rsquo;t care about risking the wrath of the average laborer in New York who is an American citizen. (&#8220;if illegal aliens are deported who will take care of the golf courses!&#8221;)</p>
<p>Just goes to show, that when you disrespect the traditional citizenry of your nation  &mdash;  THEIR CULTURE, THEIR LAWS AND CUSTOMS, THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS THEY CREATED FOR &#8220;THEIR BENEFIT&#8221;, then I wouldn&rsquo;t expect much support from those folks when the culture and ways you&rsquo;ve disrespected in the past, doesn&rsquo;t support you. How many politicians are going to have to learn that lesson??</p>

		<p>From experience in muslim countries some people have heard of Ramadan BUT! they don&rsquo;t all know that it is 30+- days long and NOTHING gets done in a muslim country for that entire period&hellip;like going to Italy for vacation in August, and finding Italy CLOSED!!! anybody been there, NOT done that?</p>

		<p>So he&rsquo;s going to be seeking re-election in the fall.  So what?</p>
<p>Mayor Bloomberg doesn&rsquo;t care!  He&rsquo;s a billionaire. He doesn&rsquo;t need this job.   He bought it.  He owns it.  Should he worry?  This position is to him just a feather in his cap, an amusement, a diversion. He was looking for a new mountain to climb, a   <i>divertissement </i> for a rich dilettante.  (Make that  &#8220;super-rich&#8221;.)  So he&rsquo;s done it all now.  As far as he&rsquo;s concerned, the public can go jump in the river. The public be damned.</p>
<p>But, you know what?  He&rsquo;s often right.   <br>
Well, he didn&rsquo;t get to be a billionaire by being often wrong.</p>

		<p>I went to a high school with a large Jewish population.  It was understood that the Jewish students would take off the important Jewish holidays, and would have to make up the work.  (Needless to say, most of them did quite well, despite the missed days.)  I see no reason why a similar accomadation can&rsquo;t be made for Muslim students (and Hindu students. etc.)  But Bloomberg is right   &mdash;   close down the school for everyone on every day that is a holiday for anyone and you&rsquo;ll wind up with no school days at all.</p>

		<p>Well, since Jews, who make up an extremely small percentage of the population(3%)pushed so hard to get their holidays on the national(and other)official calendars, it is hardly a wonder this is happening. This is the legacy of ethno-racial identity politcs and loud, vocal minorities who undermine the majority in every(once)White nation on earth. <br>

		<p>Amen, Skip. Ramadan is one reason that Moslem countries are so behind. Education and work stops for 4 weeks. Then there is the five prayer breaks they get per day.</p>

<p>#6. I know about the 5 prayers a day, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to happen in the muslim countries. This rule seems only to apply to those black muslims that come to the U.S. i.e. Swift &amp; Tyson come to mind, or those blacks that &#8216;convert&rsquo; and become muslims of convenience so they can add religious persecution to their resume alog with the legacy of slavery. Oddly, in Kuwait, the radio plays the theme song from &#8220;Lawrence of Arabia&#8221; to announce prayer times (which vary) but they are not all in the same 8 hour work day as the Somalis appeared to want at Tyson.</p>

		<p>The old saying is &#8220;A stopped clock is right twice a day&#8221;. Even an elitist like this guy Bloomberg is right sometimes. But he can just about drive you crazy with his constant ravings about the joys and wonders of diversity. His mission to destroy the NYC Police Dept is almost fullfilled so his next task is to destroy the NYC Fire Dept. You can bet dollars to doughnuts that he 100% agreeded with Sotomayor in the New Haven FD case and would favor such solutions for his Fire Dept.</p>

<p>However, Jewish people, though a small minority,  have been in the USA almost since its&rsquo; beginning and are a part of American and Judeo-Christian culture so it&rsquo;s quite understandable that they should be able to take off. Muslims are recent arrivals, that&rsquo;s the difference and Islam are a completely alien religion to our country.</p>
