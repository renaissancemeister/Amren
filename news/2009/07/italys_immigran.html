<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8170187.stm">Italy&rsquo;s Immigrants Despair at New Laws</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, July 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Proponents of Italy&rsquo;s new anti-immigration laws say they are a much-needed response to a serious problem, but critics say they recall the policies of the fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, reports the BBC World Service&rsquo;s Madeleine Morris in Milan.</p>
<p>&#8220;The life that I&rsquo;m living in Italy is very poor. I don&rsquo;t have documents. In Europe, if you don&rsquo;t have documents, you are nothing  &mdash;  you are an empty vessel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael  &mdash;  not his real name  &mdash;  is a 19-year-old Sierra Leonean who came to Italy 15 months ago.</p>
<p>He crossed the sea from Libya in a small boat, along with 65 other people. Once they landed in Italy, he claimed asylum.</p>
<p>But Michael&rsquo;s claim, along with the majority of asylum seekers who land on Italy&rsquo;s shores, was rejected.</p>
<p>Since then, he has been living illegally in the northern city of Milan, struggling to survive under Italy&rsquo;s increasingly tough policy on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>I see that policy in action as we pass an internet cafe near the hostel where he is staying.</p>
<p>Four policemen enter the cafe and single out those of African descent, asking to check their official documents.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re in here three or four times a week looking for people without papers,&#8221; Michael says.</p>
<p><b>Under fire</b></p>
<p>Italy has come under fire from groups as diverse as the Vatican and the European Commission for its strict new anti-immigration laws, which were passed in early July.</p>
<p>Under the legislation, illegal immigrants are liable to pay a fine of 10,000 euros (Â£8,700; $14,200) and can now be detained by the authorities for up to six months.</p>
<p>In addition, people who knowingly house undocumented migrants can now face up to three years in prison.</p>
<p>The new law also permits the formation of unarmed citizen patrol groups to help police keep order.</p>
<p>The European Commission is investigating the new laws to see if they comply with existing EU legislation on immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Italy is absolutely not a racist country. We just want to be sure that the immigrants who arrive on our land want to be here to work, not to make crimes,&#8221; says Paolo Grimaldi, an MP for the right-wing Northern League.</p>
<p>Mr Grimaldi, whose party leader, Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, ushered the new law through parliament, firmly believes Italy is facing an emergency.</p>
<p>With nearly 37,000 immigrants arriving on their shores last year, mostly via boats from Libya and Tunisia, many Italians agree.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are too many people. You see in the city, on the streets in Milan, two million immigrants, I think,&#8221; says one Milanese man, who did not want to give his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to help people who are poorer than me, but I want to know where they come from and what they are going to do,&#8221; says Martina, a 23-year-old Northern League supporter. &#8220;It is better if they come here legally.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Criminalised</b></p>
<p>According to Saskia Sassen, an expert on European immigration at Columbia University in New York, Italy&rsquo;s new laws could be the beginning of &#8220;a catastrophic phase&#8221; for not only migrants but also Italian citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;This law really alters the landscape by criminalising the violation,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past you were in violation of the law. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you were a criminal. This law means if you break the law, now you are considered a criminal. That&rsquo;s a big deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Grimaldi readily admits that almost no illegal immigrants would be able to pay a 10,000-euro fine. In fact, he says, that is the point.</p>
<p>European Union laws oblige all 25 countries party to the Schengen Agreement, which allows passport-free travel across the area, to allow illegal immigrants to make two &#8220;mistakes&#8221;, and the new Italian law makes such &#8220;mistakes&#8221; more likely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to expel these illegal immigrants to their country of provenance,&#8221; Mr Grimaldi says.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they have already been arrested for something before, if they don&rsquo;t pay the fine, we will have recidivism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The immigrant will have made two &#8220;mistakes&#8221;, and &#8220;so then we can make the expulsion&#8221;.</p>
<p>Italy issues very few visas to people who are already living in the country, and demand for work permits from potential immigrants greatly outstrips supply.</p>
<p>It quickly becomes a Catch-22 situation  &mdash;  illegal immigrants who have no visa are unable to get a job; those without a job are unable to get a visa.</p>
<p>As a result, both illegal and legal migrants have become an increasingly obvious presence on the streets of Italian cities.</p>
<p>At night, groups of men from across Africa, the Arab world and Asia roll out sleeping bags and cardboard boxes in Milan&rsquo;s numerous historic piazzas.</p>
<p>By day, they get by however they can  &mdash;  some by selling fake designer handbags or toys, some by stealing.</p>
<p>Michael lived on the streets of Milan for eight months before being given a bed at Casa della Carita, one of a number of charity-run hostels in the city which house immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t have a job. I can&rsquo;t go to the hospital if I am sick,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Beside him in the hostel&rsquo;s courtyard, a disparate group of migrants from as far away as Afghanistan and Bangladesh pass the time playing cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Italian people rescued me from their sea. If they didn&rsquo;t want me they shouldn&rsquo;t have rescued me,&#8221; Michael adds.<br>

		<p>Because of this insanity called diversity, the world is once again going to have what history tells us are &#8220;purges,&#8221; like what occurred in the Balkans.</p>
<p>It will come as a result of bitter inter-tribal feuding and the types of crimes that France is enduring right now.  And the responsibility for all of it will be on the heads of every self-appointed elitist who advocated such an insane policy, which any fool could easily see is completely unworkable under any circumstances.</p>

		<p>I saw guys like this all over northern Italy last summer.  Generally sprawled on park benches or lying on sidewalks, passed out in the middle of the day (generally only Africans were to be seen doing this   &mdash;   not Afghanis or Bangladeshis).  Their initiative seems to have been entirely spent in obtaining passage to Italy, and once there are content to be idle, homeless bums, only rising to beg, or steal, from American tourists like myself.  There isn&rsquo;t even a pretense of looking for work, or any hint of self-respect.</p>
<p>As bad as the Gypsies are, they at least have a plan of sorts, even if it&rsquo;s a criminal one   &mdash;   the Africans don&rsquo;t even have that.  They are useful only as pawns to Leftist propagandizers like the BBC.  Hopefully the Lega Nord can push to have them actually expelled, rather than made subject to these pointless and redundant laws which become targets for the Left.</p>

		<p>Perhaps italian laws are tough, but then maybe that is what it takes for illegals to finally understand that if you want to emigrate to another country, to actually live and work there, you have to play by the rules! </p>
<p>That means, get a visa and/or working permit; and when you&rsquo;ve been (legally, I mean) in that same country for a few years, you may apply for citizenship, and be allowed to vote when it&rsquo;s election time. Otherwise, you are just an illegal alien and should not be allowed to stay there, or work there without paying any taxes while hoping to benefit from government paid services, etc.</p>
<p>I think those are fairly simple concepts to understand, even for certain African immigrants&hellip;</p>
<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s about playing by the rules, in a country that is not your own, to begin with.</p>

		<p>All I can say is good for Italy! Only recently, African immigrants were rioting over the shooting deaths of a couple of drug pushers, by Italian drug king pins. But why did Italians need to suffer through riots, and overturned cars over a turf war between criminals? They certainly do not need to go the way of France, and endure annual riots, with torched vehicles and structures, by a hostile group of immigrants who feel they still aren&rsquo;t getting enough, despite having a welfare system supporting them in the suburbs, all at the expense of tax-payers. All these immigrants will bring them is grief in the long run, and soon they will be trying to tell them the Italian flag offends them, the way they have in the UK. It&rsquo;s good to see some European countries still have a spine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the past you were in violation of the law. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you were a criminal. This law means if you break the law, now you are considered a criminal.

That&rsquo;s what got them in this mess to begin with.<br>

But seriously, other wealthy British retirees, i doubt anyone tried to emigrate to Italy in the 1920s and 30s.<br>

<p>OMG its hard to even read such nonsense. Of course they were criminals before. </p>
<p>I love the line about not being able to go to the hospitals, when on EARTH will americans start protecting our hospitals against the massive throngs of illegals who abuse them, who get flown in, driven in ambulances from mexico or the 7 months pregnant woman who cross the borders to make an AMERICAN baby. </p>

I must partially disagree with Francois. He&rsquo;s right, up to a point, but he doesn&rsquo;t follow the logic through to the end.   For him   &mdash;   and for many, many others too   &mdash;   this debate about legal vs. illegal is just a diversion, a distraction away from the real issues.    </p>
<p>Whether they&rsquo;re  legal or illegal, in the long run, <i><b>is really irrelevant!  </b></i>  Legal or illegal, these &#8220;immigrants&#8221;  are  still THERE.   And being there is the main thing.    Once they&rsquo;re in, they&rsquo;ll want more.  And so will their children and grandchildren.  By that time, you&rsquo;ll never be rid of them.  Your country will have become their country, and they&rsquo;ll be demanding an ever-larger slice.</p>
<p>They should NEVER be given citizenship or allowed to vote!   But of course,  the only sure guarantee against that is not to have them physically present in the first place. </p>
<p>Otherwise, the Left  (playing on people&rsquo;s sympathies)  will sneak them in as poor, hungry WORKERS, or pathetic, desperate REFUGEES, and then  - a few years later - will point to their wretched conditions and will appeal for granting them citizenship&hellip; or at least for their children.  Then, the fatal process of nation-wrecking has begun, and it will be very difficult to turn back the clock.   (Just look at Germany and France,  now stuck with 3 generations of &#8220;guest workers&#8221; who have never seen any other country and who have nowhere else to go.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essential to keep them completely OUT.   As was always historically the case, every country must do its own work and provide its own workers.  Imported  cheap labor should be outlawed.  In the past, geographical distance  and the difficulty of travel accomplished this automatically; but now   &mdash;    when easy air travel makes any part of the globe reachable within 24 hours   &mdash;   it must be legislated in a conscious way.  </p>
<p>If you want to keep Italy Italian (et cetera with the other countries), you must enact stringent laws and then vigorously ENFORCE them.  And I&rsquo;m sorry, but you must be ruthless. If you succumb to compassion in dealing with invaders, the war will have been lost. (And make no mistake, this <i><b>is </b></i> a war!)</p>
<p>Yes, Francois, &#8220;playing by the rules&#8221; is important.  But why even have them there?  Why should they be playing in Italy AT ALL?  </p>
<p>Let them play by their OWN rules   &mdash;    back in Africa.</p>

<p>Exactly.  Mentioning the words  &#8220;Mussolini&#8221;,  &#8220;Fascist&#8221;,  &#8220;Nazi&#8221;,  etc.  is just a propaganda strategy for bringing up hostile emotions and slanting the story to the left.   The Left calls anybody (or thing)  that they don&rsquo;t like &#8220;fascist&#8221;.   And most people have been so thoroughly  conditioned that they recoil when they hear such words.    After a lifetime of conditioning, it&rsquo;s become a knee-jerk reflex.   The media have turned us all into Pavlovian dogs.</p>

<p>Fear of the R word keeps all politicians in check, because they know a shakedown from a Sharpton or a Jackson type, can spell the end of their political ambitions. So they all vigilantly enforce a PC multicultural agenda.</p>

Does anyone really believe that the all-powerful EU will allow this law to stand without issuing loud threats of sanctions, trade restrictions, et al against Italy.</p>
<p>The EU can&rsquo;t let any European country out from under their iron-fisted yoke lest they all rebel.  The EU has issued statements declaring that hundreds of millions more &#8220;immigrants&#8221; must be settled in Europe in the near future. </p>

They can threaten revolt and discord all they want at these new laws, but it&rsquo;s the countries who give into these threats, that open themselves up to more violent riots, and of course more immigrants. Standing strong will actually prevent more of these types of displays in European countries.</p>

We can&rsquo;t enact ANY laws because none of these countries are democracies. If they were democracies, obviously the majority of the indigenous population would never voted to allow in a single immigrant. The FIRST thing we all need to do is to start demanding weekly referenda, using the Robinson Voting Method (fraud proof, with instant results), and then watch as the spineless politicians try to weasle their way out of giving us our birthright.</p>

		<p><i>If they do work it is to sell knock-off Italian designer purses to tourists, and usually these knock-offs are stolen.</i></p>
<p>I would not call it &#8220;working.&#8221;  They just sit in a crouch on the sidewalk without doing anything, with the handbags laid out in front of them.  </p>
<p>I have it on good authority from American expats living there that these bags are not stolen, but are Chinese knockoffs, ordered by the Mafia or Camorra, and used as a means of laundering drug money (if you look closely, you will see the bags are all the same from vendor to vendor).  Each African vendor has his &#8220;territory&#8221; allocated by the mob, and the regular cops won&rsquo;t touch them.  I witnessed one African guy on his own try to set up shop on the Ponte Sisto, and plainclothes &#8220;cops&#8221; showed up within minutes, roughed him up, and hustled him into a squad car.  The American tourists are oblivious to all this, but this is what is actually going down. <br>

  (to RICHARD) Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow, <br>
  Rivers, that died at Pomfret. Despair, and die! </p>
<p>   So the illegal immigrants are despairing that Italy is enforcing their laws? They should consider themselves lucky they&rsquo;re not getting a good thrashing on the way out. However, Italy is an ancient, civilized country so Italia give them a free box lunch and ten bucks (7.51 Euros) along with passage home and God speed.    </p>

<p>Very interesting information there. And, yes you&rsquo;re of course right, none of them appear to be working at all, most actually are just stooping or squatting on the ground</p>

		<p>I saw a TV documentary here recently  in Australia which reported  these immigration laws and  the `vigilante Italians`  who supported it in a most unfavorable light</p>
<p> Anyway its great to see the country of my father and his forefathers <br>
standing up to the lunatic immigration policies of most if the Western world.Undoubtedly pressure from the Eurpoean Union may<br>
cause these laws to be repealed or watered down &hellip;I sincerely<br>
hope not<br>
 I really think many good decent Italians along with there<br>
descendants in US,Australia etc possess a strong racial identity and sense of  what needs to be done to preserve <br>
our heritage and culture even more than there Anglo cousins  <br>
Indeed it will be interesting ro see what other European nations stand firm with the Italians on the front line.<br>
Viva Italia!     <br>

<i>Proponents of Italy&rsquo;s new anti-immigration laws say they are a much-needed response to a serious problem, but critics say they recall the policies of the fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, reports the BBC World Service&rsquo;s Madeleine Morris in Milan.</i></p>
<p><br>
Congratulations, BBC! You managed to work the words &#8220;fascist,&#8221; &#8220;dictator&#8221; and &#8220;Mussolini&#8221; all into your opening sentence   &mdash;   and in an article that&rsquo;s about NONE of these things! </p>
<p>When it comes to passing off slanted, scaremongering Cultural Marxist propaganda as straightforward reporting, this is the left-wing equivalent of hitting a home run! Top <i>that</i>, CNN! </p>

		<p>Good for Italy and to hell with the yellow destroyers of the distinct european cultures. Compassion is the tool so commonly used to disolve the natural resolve inherent in sucessful nations,like the gypsy&rsquo;s nocking at your door. There is a male and female component to life, Yin &amp; Yang as we know Thus The masculine form and definition and the Feminine nurture etc. These need to be harmonized..You cannot have a happy family whithout knowing who its members are! Definition compliments substance,..since Hitler there has been an effort to continually undermine white male resolve and self respect. I think its been enough of this!!! The continual ploy of beggars comming with their hands open and sorrowful eyes with hidden serpentine designs is getting old.</p>
