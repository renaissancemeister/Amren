<h1>Stabbing Suspect Is &#8216;Lost Boys&rsquo; Refugee</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elizabeth Zavala, Star-Telegram (Fort Worth), July 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man shot by police Monday after they said he repeatedly stabbed a UPS driver on her delivery route was one of the &#8220;Lost Boys of Sudan&#8221; refugees who came to Fort Worth this decade, a minister said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Police identified the suspect as James Panchol, 32. Panchol was in critical condition Tuesday and was scheduled for surgery at John Peter Smith Hospital, said Sgt. Pedro Criado, a police spokesman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wichieng Wetnyangran, associate pastor of African Immigrant Ministries at Peace Lutheran Church in Hurst, said Panchol was part of the group of about 40 Lost Boys who came to Tarrant County in 2001. More than 4 million refugees came to the United States to escape years of civil war and famine in their country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s absolutely a shock,&#8221; Wetnyangran said of reports that Panchol is a suspect in the stabbing. &#8220;That was a part of the life they ran away from. They were hoping their lives would change.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Texas Department of Public Safety records, Panchol pleaded guilty in Tarrant County in 2002 to a misdemeanor charge of resisting arrest.</p>
<p>During Monday&rsquo;s incident, officers were called about 12:30 p.m. to a reported stabbing at the Bent Tree apartments on Randall Way in west Fort Worth. Witnesses told police that the man approached the UPS driver and repeatedly stabbed her in the back, according to reports.</p>
<p>The driver apparently broke free and ran, police and witnesses said. The man was chasing the woman when police arrived. He was ordered twice by officers to drop the knife and refused each time, police said. When one of the officers fired a Taser at the man, he charged her, police said, and the other officer shot the suspect with his weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;They told me the Taser did work, but the suspect pulled the probes out of his body,&#8221; Criado said. The officer who deployed the Taser was treated for minor injuries and is on paid administrative leave.</p>

		<p>I am a Lutheran Pastor and these idiotic liberal Lutheran churches that are importing third worlders into this country in the name of Christ are devilish and insane. I just wish these heretics would take the name Lutheran off their church signs. They are embarassing the real Lutheran churches in this nation. </p>

		<p>Oh, what a sob story we were treated to by the media when these &#8220;lost boys&#8221; were to come here and how they would be model citizens and we would be such caring compassionate people to take them in&hellip; I am surprised this has even been printed. They normally keep us in the dark about anything they hold up as a worthy cause and especially if they are Africans..wonder how many of the others have committed crimes?  These &#8220;ministries&#8221; who bring in all these refugees need to be held accountable for all the costs of their livlihood and of all their crimes! Sue the caring &#8220;Christian&#8221; ministries that are in the forefront of bringing in all 3rd world refugees!</p>

		<p>Amazing, this is within 14 miles of where I live.  And people wonder why UPS wont deliver to certain &#8216;dark&rsquo; neighborhoods after 5pm.</p>
<p>Their lives will never change, because their lives are shaped by their genetics.  Which just so happens to include a low iq, low impulse control and a propensity for choosing short term thrills over long term planning whenever the choice between the two comes up.</p>
<p>Blacks around here are all the same.  They&rsquo;re either low class drug using criminals or working a minimum wage job with a very visible chip on their shoulder.</p>

<p>And what could have possessed him to attack a female UPS driver? Did she look vulnerable to him simply because she was a woman? It would be interesting to know the race of the victim.</p>

		<p>I remember watching a 60 minuets story about the lost boys.  It followed them to America and documented their six month transition.  Their American friends expanded their nurses aid training program because they all failed.  Yep, they could not learn how to make a bed and do simple cleaning.  The most memorable moment was when they saw a video to help prepare them for the winter.  It featured snow.  One African, excuse me, new American, raised his hand and asked &#8221; do we stay in all winter?&#8221;  &#8220;No, we still go to work and continue our daily lives in the winter time&#8221;, she replied.  It was obvious the story was supposed to end with these immigrants being fully transitioned into American society.  Instead, They had to end it saying that cultural differences were so vast that it would take some more time.  </p>

		<p>As if we don&rsquo;t have enough violent blacks in this country we have to import more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one more example of the degeneration of this country.</p>
<p>Overpopulation is now beginning to be critical.  Couple thast with a falling economy, dwindling water and food, and it all  equates to just plain stupidity.</p>
<p>Thankfully this bunch went to live in the black area or so it appears.  Those that want white areas should be sent to Massa chusetts, Connecticut or some other radically liberal area.</p>
<p>And everyone of them should be given white cololar jobs working next to white PC types who are always defending them, because they&rsquo;re too stupid to know any better,</p>
<p>Sorry, but there&rsquo;s no nice way to describe stupidity with a euphemism.</p>

<p>I remember that 60min piece.  They showed some of the &#8220;Lost Boys&#8221; being settled in Atlanta, which obviously suffered before then from a lack of Africans.  They followed up on a few that were settled in Kansas City (as I bite my tongue really hard).  White people had to show them how to use a flush toilet and sliding glass doors that lead out to an apartment porch.  They were supposedly required to get jobs to repay our Yankee government for the cost of relocating them, but I highly doubt they ever did nor did the Yankee government ever work too hard to get their money.  After they learned how to use the sliding glass doors, I would bet that they spent most of their time sitting on the porches.  Yep, they&rsquo;re assimilated already to (Afro-)American culture.</p>

<p>Illegal Aliens Arrested on Wire Fraud Charges<br>
Department of Justice ^ | July 30, 2009 | United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office Eastern District of Louisiana </p>
<p><br>
NEW ORLEANS, LA &mdash; </p>
<p>JALLA PIERRE EMANUEL, age 38, and JACKSON NTONE NDEMBA, age 35, citizens of the Republic of Cameroon, were arrested yesterday by Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and charged by a criminal complaint with conspiracy and wire fraud, announced U.S. Attorney Jim Letten. </p>
<p>According to the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, EMANUEL and NDEMBA fraudulently represented that they could produce two counterfeit bills utilizing one real bill. FBI investigation eventually resulted in a meeting with the defendants in which the defendants expected to receive $60,000 in U.S. currency from which they said they would produce $120,000 in counterfeit U.S. currency. The defendants were arrested at an agreed-upon meeting place at which time they were found to be in possession of approximately $68,000 counterfeit United States currency. </p>
<p>EMANUEL and NDEMBA will make their initial court appearance before United States Magistrate Judge Louis Moore, Jr. at 2:00 P.M. today, Thursday, July 30, 2009, and the government will request that defendants be detained. </p>
<p>If convicted, defendants face a maximum term of imprisonment of twenty (20) years, a fine of $250,000.00, and three (3) years of supervised release following any term of imprisonment. </p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Letten reiterated that a criminal complaint is merely a charge and that the guilt of the defendant must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>This investigation was conducted by Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Secret Service. The prosecution of this case is being handled by Assistant United States Attorneys Gregory M. Kennedy and W. Scott Laragy.</p>

		<p>I notice that these &#8220;poor souls&#8221; were living in apartment complexes. Why were they not sent to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard?!? I mean, all of the PC Whites there just love these little 21st century barbarians, right? I mean, what&rsquo;s the matter, they would be getting more cultural enrichment. Hey maybe they&rsquo;ll even see a cannibal scene. Wouldn&rsquo;t THAT just be so open-minded and enriching?</p>

		<p>The UPS driver was at fault.  Had she been more cognizant of the (31 yr old) boys culture she wouldn&rsquo;t have caused a misunderstanding.  This misunderstanding frightened the boy, he felt endangered and was merely defending himself.  After the UPS driver gets out of prison she should be sent to a cultural awareness course.  Remember, what you consider a friendly greeting, or even a blank stare, may be considered a threat by someone with differing cultural norms.<br>

		<p>It is simply too much of a culture shock for a war-torn Sudanese refugee to move to Fort Worth, Texas.  Our government thinks we are doing these Third Worlders a favor, but the culture clash must fill them with despair.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be logical for these immigrants to move to a country similar to Sudan so they could feel more in their element?</p>
<p>Now look at the price tag of this tragedy, all billable to U.S. taxpaying suckers, I mean, citizens.  Critical care treatment at major hospital, $1 million or so.  Trial with court appointed attorneys, $750,000 or so.  Prison for 25 years, $1 million or so.  Welfare programs and public schooling for his (presumably) large family, $750,000 or so.  Did I forget anything?</p>

		<p>4 Million is surely nonsense.  One article written in early 2008 says that there were 28,123 refugees from the Sudan in the U.S.  Another give the total of all refugees to the U.S. for 2003 as  28,455 (out of a legal ceiling of 70,000.  BTW, the same article says &#8220;The top three countries of origin for those resettling in the United States in FY 2003 were, in order, the former USSR (8,744), Liberia (2,957), and Iran (2,471).&#8221;)   Oddly, despite the fervor of the treasonous elite for committing racist colonialist genocide against their own people and nation,  they didn&rsquo;t meet the any of the regional numbers ceilings or the total ceiling for refugees in 2003.   And the numbers dropped significantly from 1993; for instance  the top two source countries were the USSR (48,627) and Vietnam (42,775) in 1993, and the former USSR (8,744) and Liberia (2,957) in 2003.   Refugees are a category that the politicians can&rsquo;t claim they don&rsquo;t have direct responsibility for, I suppose.   The trend may reverse itself under the Bamster,  though.</p>
