<h1><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-immigration26-2009jul26,0,304778.story">Obama Setting the Priorities on Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Gorman, Los Angeles Times, July 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As Congress moves slowly on immigration reform, President Obama is making numerous policy changes in enforcement and other areas that are designed to shift priorities and boost confidence in the administration as it lays the groundwork for possible legislation.</p>
<p>Most of the changes are being driven by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and are primarily aimed at illegal immigrants with criminal records and employers who hire undocumented workers. Napolitano is working with lawmakers to develop a strategy for comprehensive legislative reforms.</p>
<p>In the meantime, she is &#8220;taking steps to ensure enforcement is conducted wisely and well,&#8221; said White House spokesman Nick Shapiro.</p>
<p>The recent administrative changes include:</p>
<p>* New guidelines directing immigration agents to target employers who hire illegal immigrants rather than simply arresting undocumented employees.</p>
<p>* A requirement that all local police agencies deputized to check immigration status and turn criminals over for possible deportation sign new agreements pledging to focus on those who pose a risk to public safety.</p>
<p>* The implementation of a rule that requires federal contractors to use E-Verify, an online employment-verification program.</p>
<p>* The expansion of a program that uses government databases during the booking process to find illegal immigrants in the nation&rsquo;s jails.</p>
<p>Napolitano is expected to address immigration detention next. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigrant-rights advocates praised Obama for fixing what he can now while he begins working on reform legislation. Obama has said repeatedly that he will push for a bill that would include a path to legalization for the nation&rsquo;s undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes sense to do now what the administration can do,&#8221; said Ana Avendano of the AFL-CIO. &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t have to go through Congress. It doesn&rsquo;t have to go through the toxic political process.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But critics said Obama and Homeland Security officials were weakening the immigration laws and making it easier for illegal immigrants to live and work in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are systematically gutting the enforcement capabilities of the federal government,&#8221; said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. &#8220;Their strategy is to try and demonstrate they are serious about [enforcement] at the same time without actually doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government may have shifted its focus to employers, but workers are still being laid off because of increased audits and the use of E-Verify, said Nathalie Contreras, a union organizer and member of Southern California Immigration Coalition. {snip}</p>
<p>Overhill Farms, a major food processing plant in Vernon, fired 260 workers in May after an Internal Revenue Service audit found that they provided &#8220;invalid or fraudulent&#8221; Social Security numbers. Like agriculture, the food-processing and preparation sectors rely heavily on immigrant labor, much of it illegal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the border, Napolitano has shifted hundreds of federal agents and intelligence analysts to the area to target the southbound flow of weapons and the northbound flow of drugs, attack the drug cartels and prevent drug violence from spilling into the U.S.</p>
<p>The federal government is also clearing the backlog of pending FBI background checks on immigration petitions and speeding up processing of citizenship applications.</p>
<p>Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose) said it&rsquo;s always faster for the president to make policy than for Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t need 218 votes in the House and 60 votes in the Senate, or floor time or debate time,&#8221; she said. But Lofgren said only Congress can fix the legal immigration process and the long waits for family petitions. She also hasn&rsquo;t agreed with every change and is still waiting for Napolitano to address medical care in detention.</p>

<p>Gosh, I guess we are no longer a democratic Republic.  Hail the President.</p>
<p>Obama wants to speed up the dispossession of whites to get over with as soon as possible.  That is all it amounts too.  Of course that is what GW wanted as well.</p>

		<p>I agree that enforcement should target employers who hire illegals. Arresting and deporting illegals isn&rsquo;t much better than catch and release. But going after employers with very serious penalties will take away the reason illegals come here in the first place. </p>
<p>I also think enforcement should target those who knowingly rent or sell houses and vehicles to illegals. </p>
<p>E-Verify should be mandatory and expanded to include any person or business who hires, rents or sells houses &amp; vehicles.</p>

		<p>The article says that most of the changes in immigration enforcement are aimed at &#8220;illegal immigrants&#8221; with criminal records and employers who hire &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221;. First of all a comment about the writer Anna Gorman. Years and years have gone by and liberals writing for the liberal newspapers, like Ms.Gorman, still haven&rsquo;t read U.S. immigration law, in which the correct term for those in this nation illegallh is &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221;. </p>
<p>Second point, Ms. Napolitano is an abomination as a law enforcement officer. As the Govenor of Arizona, she faught against those who tried to enforce EXISTING U.S. IMMIGRATION LAWS with all of her political might. Now she is focusing on those with &#8220;criminal records&#8221; and employers who hire undocumented workers. In other words, it won&rsquo;t be until some illegal alien,from Mexico or elsewhere, commits mayhem on some American, and thus, then has a criminal record, that will cause  Ms. Napolitano to finally bother to move into action. The concern and priority for Americans safety is touching. As far as employers go, please, can one really imagine a scenario where the administration is going to stand up to Tyson chicken and hundreds of other sweat shops, small employers,etc. of illegal aliens? That&rsquo;s harder than imagining that Hillary and Bill Clinton will give up their obsequious social climbing ways in politics, and go off happily into the sunset.</p>
<p>Americans, considering their present layed back attitude, are never going to be the masters of who comes into their nation, how many come in, or any other part of what goes on involving illegal or even legal immigration into their nation. All we keep doing is reacting(like trying to stop amnesties by traitors) instead of taking action in accordance with our vision and dreams for the U.S.</p>

		<p>Do they not teach compounding in school anymore? Any politician that advocates a growth rate above 0% has no grasp of logic. </p>
<p>Finite resources divided by increasing populations can only mean less for each. What kind of fool can&rsquo;t deduce such simple truths?</p>
<p>Finite space divided by increasing populations can only result in increased crowding. What kind of imbecile would recommend this path?</p>
<p>These are inarguable realities, just as the current POTUS is every bit the arrogant idiot as the last.</p>

		<p>Are there illegals with NO criminal records?<br>
So crossing the border, stealing a SSN, photocopying IDs and documents, driving with fake license and no insurance, etc,  is OKAY? </p>

		<p>Among the steps the article credits Obama with are the following:<br>
&#8220;The implementation of a rule that requires federal contractors to use E-Verify, an online employment-verification program.&#8221; </p>
<p>Wrong! Obama himself keeps delaying implementation of the rule. In addition, Obama is a lying sneak. While he pays lip service to EVERIFY, he gives the green light to proimmigration antiwhite and antiAmerican fanatics like Senators Cardin and Boxer to kill bills to make EVERIFY permanent. These turncoats want to legalize every illegal and know that steering jobs the illegals&rsquo; way is key to the plot.</p>
<p>Currently the Homeland Security bill in the Senate has provisions to make EVERIFY mandatory and permanent. The House, led by proillegal Nancy Pelosi, doesnt have such a mandate. A conference will have to decide. </p>
<p>Which side do you think Obama will support? He is desperate to make sure over 50% of this nation in nonwhite so he can establish a total dictatorship based on support from the antiAmerican illegal immigrant mob.  </p>
<p>That is what immigration is about in the USA today, ladies and gentlemen. What&rsquo;s left of YOUR Freedom. Right now. Not much.</p>

		<p>If you don&rsquo;t think the $90 to $100 BILLION annual cost of illegal immigrants and their broods are bad enough&hellip; listen to this: NPR Radio had a news feature yesterday evening. The federal government wants more translators in hospitals and health care facilities (paid for, by guess who?)&hellip; seems the damned illegals and their families are not getting enough QUALITY HEALTHCARE, courtesy of the American taxpayers. Now we have to hire and pay for plentiful Spanish-English translators!</p>
<p>If ever a nation was ripe for&hellip; if ever a time was proper for a revolution&hellip; surely that time is now. We, the American citizens, taxpayers are being betrayed left and right by our own government leaders!</p>

		<p>As Bill Clinton said&hellip;It is a good thing when Whites become the minority in the good ole USA. Looks like most Whites have bought into that lie.</p>
<p> Just listen to any talk radio (so-called conservative) and how demonized any caller who dares to talk about race and some FACTS concerning nonwhites and you will quickly be hung up on and called a racist, white supremacist, nazi, bigot, anti-semite and every name in the book by these so-called good Americans and patriots.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about the &#8220;fix&#8221; that Obama has started. His numbers are dropping like a stone, and it won&rsquo;t be too long before the black Jimmy Carter will have trouble fixing a card game with Michelle and the kids. Illegal immigrants need a path back to where they came from, and enforcement of the law to help them on their way, not a path to citizenship to pad the voter base of the liberal democrats. 26% of the voters that put Barry in office are black and brown. The rest are white. How is that Obamination working out for you so far? Stay tuned. It WILL get worse.</p>

		<p>feller - it won&rsquo;t take 50% of us being non-white to control the country, but much less due to the number of whites on the treasonous Left.  I&rsquo;m sorry to see such opposition to E-Verify, which is a great way to throw illegals out of their jobs and encourage them to go home on their own dime rather than our&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>And this thing about Napolitano (aka The Lesbionic Woman) only worried about &#8220;immigrants with criminal records&#8221;.  You mean like breaking into our country and stealing someone&rsquo;s identity, etc., like eds mentioned?  Hmmm&hellip;<br>

		<p>#12 Thomas Jackson, you&rsquo;re right about Zoe Lofgren. She has also uriniated on California voters decisions over the years. She has, in fact, along with the whole Democratic Party in Sacramento, presided over the downfall of California for years. That is to say, she was part of the cause of its downfall. Just my opinion as an American, if we&rsquo;re still allowed to have one.</p>
