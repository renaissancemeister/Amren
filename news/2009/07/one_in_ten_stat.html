			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), July 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly 400,000 homes have gone to tenants who were born abroad, the Government&rsquo;s equality watchdog has said.</p>
<p>One in ten state-subsidised homes is occupied by an immigrant family, according to the first estimate of the impact of immigration on social housing.</p>
<p>More than half of the immigrants who live in council or housing association houses and flats are in London, the report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission found.</p>
<p>It added that four out of ten people born abroad who live in the capital are living in subsidised housing  &mdash;  a figure that suggests a million people in immigrant families have found homes in social housing in London.</p>
<p>The report blamed Home Office decisions to house asylum seekers in empty social housing around the country for &#8216;fuelling misconceptions that asylum seekers are queue jumping and being allocated social housing ahead of white British applicants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It acknowledged that there is tension over who gets social housing in London and other cities including Birmingham.</p>
<p>But despite evidence of increasing anger over the allocation of housing in poorer and traditionally Labour-voting areas, the report insisted that there is no prejudice against the existing population in the decisions over who gets increasingly scarce homes.</p>
<p>It said the tension that has led to a growing vote for the far right British National Party in some parts of the country should be dealt with by fostering more positive attitudes to immigration and enforcing equality laws.</p>
<p>The conclusions will undermine Gordon Brown&rsquo;s latest plans to allow local authorities to give longstanding local residents priority in the queue for homes.</p>
<p>The report was drawn up for the Equality Commission by the Labour think tank Institute for Public Policy Research, which has a long record of support for large-scale immigration.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s chief, Trevor Phillips, is said to be likely to be forced out of his job this autumn.</p>
<p>Two years ago former minister Margaret Hodge, MP for Barking in East London, began a Labour row when she complained that migrant families were being given priority for homes over those with a &#8216;legitimate sense of entitlement&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards Whitehall published the first estimate of numbers of foreigners in social housing, which suggested that one in 12 people in subsidised homes are foreign citizens.</p>
<p>However the figures published by the Equality Commission yesterday are based on the large-scale Labour Force Survey run by the Government&rsquo;s Office for National Statistics.</p>
<p>They count people born abroad, the measure accepted by statisticians as a better estimate of real numbers of immigrants.</p>
<p>The one in ten national estimate for social homes occupied by immigrants obscures much higher proportions of migrants in council and housing association property in some areas.</p>
<p>The report said that more than half of immigrant social tenants are in London, partly because of the high cost of renting or buying private homes.</p>
<p>It added: &#8216;The most hostile attitudes about migration and social housing allocation were evident in places where there was a high proportion of the population on social housing waiting lists and where owner occupancy was most unaffordable, for example in Barking and in Birmingham.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some migrant groups, the report said, were highly dependent on social housing because their families had higher numbers of children and were more likely to be without work.</p>
<p>They included families from Afghanistan, Somalia and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>However Poles and other eastern Europeans who have arrived since 2004 are less likely to occupy social homes, it found, possibly because many see themselves returning home in future rather than staying long-term in Britain.</p>
<p>Only 11 per cent of migrants over the last five years live in social housing, the report said.</p>
<p>New immigrants with the right to live in Britain have been entitled to social housing since the 70s, when waiting lists which favoured local families were abolished and replaced with systems that allocated homes on the basis of need.</p>
<p>Homelessness, several children, pregnancy and poverty have since been factors that automatically push people towards the head of the queue.</p>
<p>But Robert Whelan, housing expert at the Civitas think tank, said: &#8216;In some areas most units of social housing are going to immigrants, which provides fertile soil for the BNP.</p>
<p>&#8216;This report does not reflect the concerns of working class people and it is extremely unhelpful at a time when the BNP is hoovering up votes.</p>
<p>&#8216;It does not recognise the claims of longstanding local residents whose families have contributed to communities for generations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Equality Commission chairman Trevor Phillips said: &#8216;Much of the public concern about the impact of migration on social housing has, at its heart, the failure of social housing supply to meet the demands of the population.</p>
<p>&#8216;The poorer the area, the longer the waiting lists, therefore the greater the tension.</p>
<p>&#8216;Government and social housing providers need to work with the communities they serve to address these issues.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Most of 1.8% of allocations are in London where they make about 20% of the annual London wide allocations. This report ignores this so that they can pretend that we Brits are paranoid racists.</p>

		<p>Enoch Powell could not have been more right when he gave his great speech 50 years ago. Powell was driven from polite society because his claims were so outrageous, yet point by point, they&rsquo;ve come true. Instead of vindication, for being so precisely right, recently a UK politician was sacked just for pointing it out, that Powell was right. Hounding those like Powell has become a mindless habit. They can fire those with an important position but they can&rsquo;t stop a bumper sticker. </p>

<p>As if the United Kingdom has infinite resources.  It is insanity for any country to bring in people who immediately become wards of the state, and thus a burden on taxpayers.  Of course the United States does this all the time.<br>

		<p>Now here is a typical piece of Home office deceit and guile that (unfortunately) will con the masses.<br>
  It was loudly and proudly trumpeted out that &#8216;new immigrants in the past 5 years &#8216;only&rsquo; took 2% of the total social housing stock&rsquo;.<br>
This is highly misleading.<br>
Firstly, the total &#8216;social housing stock&rsquo; (ie state subsidised and state owned housing), is of enormous proportions, probably accounting for a good 30% or more of the total housing stock, thusly comprising of millions upon millions of houses and flats.<br>
 2% of this number therefore equates to an absolutely very large number of dwellings.<br>
  Secondly, and more importantly, council houses and flats are typically held by their tenants for a very long time, usually the tenancy is only broken on the death of the tenant,therefore it is reasonable to say that the avaerage council hose tenancy is in the tens of years.So, therefore the only meaningful metric is &#8216;what proportion of new tenancies agreed last year were for immigrants?&rsquo; - as 2% of the entire stock was taken by immigrants in only 5 years, then this proprtion must be substantial.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what its all about-fostering more positive attitudes to immigration (continue to brainwash whites into seeing immigration as a good thing, dispite all evidence to the contrary) and enforcing equality laws (allow whites to be terrorized by non-whites, and arrest any white that dares to stand up.) And make sure you have a boogey-man to blame all problems on (the BNP)</p>

		<p>Here is an update of a report (see BNP link below)just out today 8 July 2009 which proves categorically that the politically-correct EHRC &amp; the government have been lying and indeed immigrants are given priority over indigeous Britons in regards to social housing.</p>
<p>&#8221;Independent and respected think thank Migrationwatch has confirmed the accuracy of the British National Party&rsquo;s analysis that immigrants are given priority over indigenous British people in the social housing ladder &hellip; Writing on the Migrationwatch website, that organisation&rsquo;s chairman, Sir Andrew Green, said that the facts showed that &ldquo;white working-class people were indeed being leapfrogged by new arrivals with large families &hellip; Under a heading called &#8216;At last, the truth about immigration and council house queue jumping,&rsquo; Sir Andrew said the Government&rsquo;s announcement that they are handing councils new powers to give local people priority on the waiting list for social housing &ldquo;is a clear admission that they have been misleading us over the huge impact of immigration on housing &hellip; So who on these bulging lists actually gets a council house? Currently, it is decided on the basis of &lsquo;need&rsquo; which, in turn, is heavily influenced by family size &hellip; And once granted residence, a migrant or an asylum seeker can bring over his entire family and thereby move up the priority list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An indigenous British person can be years on the housing list but keep being pushed to the back of the waiting list by &#8216;refugee claimants&rsquo; with large families. It&rsquo;s blindingly obvious that in the UK the forces of Cultural Marxism/political correctness are in retreat &amp; absolutely only the blindest of the blind now believe anything they say.</p>

		<p>&#8216;The answer is to build more houses!&rsquo; -So runs the glib New Labour line, notwithstanding the fact that Britain has signally failed to build enough houses for its population in at least the past 65 years.<br>
 Of course, public expenditure in britain will be severly constrained in the forseeable future, due to the fiscal meltdown engendered by labour&rsquo;s economic policies, and in a tyime of deep cuts in government spending, houses come pretty low on the priority list, when the &#8216;shroud-wavers&rsquo; complaining abot cuts in health and education are in full throat.<br>
  Thus is the caliber and intellectual &#8216;ability&rsquo; of the 2nd rate rabble who make Labour &#8216;policy&rsquo;.<br>
  On an historical note, since the end of WW2, Britain has simply never been able to build enough homes to meet the need for housing, this is due to various ingrained structural reasons.By contrast Germany and the other continental nations that were truly bombed-out DID manage to build sufficient housing.<br>
  The film &#8216;Cathy Come Home&rsquo; which made Ken Loach&rsquo;s reputation as a director, and which deeply shocked a nation way back in 1966 is still very relevant, only the situation is even worse now.The sad fact is that the heart-rending scenes depicted in the film are only too true.</p>
