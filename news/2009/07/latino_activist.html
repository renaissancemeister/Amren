<h1><a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB124847141935480015.html">Latino Activists Seize on Texas Ruling to Boost Voting Power</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephanie Simon, Wall Street Journal, July 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latino activists are seeking to gain political clout by forcing electoral changes in communities nationwide, using a recent federal court decision in Irving, Texas, as a template.</p>
<p>The city of 200,000, a Dallas suburb, was ordered to reorganize its municipal election system to give Hispanics more voting power. Irving had been choosing its council members through citywide &#8220;at large&#8221; elections, but U.S. District Judge Jorge A. Solis ruled that the system diluted the influence of Irving&rsquo;s fast-growing minority population, which is concentrated in the southern half of the city.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t impose a specific remedy but said any new system  &mdash;  perhaps electing council members by district  &mdash;  must allow &#8220;Hispanics to elect candidates of their own choosing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ruling offers a road map for activists who expect the 2010 census to show big growth in the Latino population, especially in Southern states such as Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina. With the data in hand, they plan to press politicians to give Latino residents more influence when they redraw congressional and state legislative districts, and to force cities and towns to retool municipal elections  &mdash;  or face lawsuits like the one in Irving.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Irving, like other suburbs of Dallas, has churned with ethnic tension in recent years. City police have turned over more than 1,600 illegal immigrants suspected of various crimes to federal authorities for deportation, to the outrage of some in the Hispanic community. Last year, the Justice Department sent federal observers to monitor city elections to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationwide, Latinos and other minorities have been challenging at-large voting systems in court for three decades and have won scores of victories, including a landmark case in Dallas in 1990.</p>
<p>Afterward, Dallas was divided into 14 council districts, which has greatly increased minority representation  &mdash;  but has also fueled discontent, with critics saying the council members run their districts like fiefdoms, with little concern for the greater good.</p>
<p>Mr. Gears says he supports diversity on the Irving city council but fears adopting a Dallas-style system will jeopardize the city&rsquo;s stability  &mdash;  built on a strong business community and low tax rate  &mdash;  by &#8220;creating parochialism and opportunities for corruption and shenanigans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Latino advocates respond that they deserve a voice in policy making and will insist on districts and election rules that make that possible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Census directors are making an all-out effort to reach Hispanics and other groups considered hard to count because of language and cultural barriers. For the first time, the census will send a bilingual questionnaire to 13 million Spanish-speaking homes. Telemundo is even integrating census-related plot twists into its Spanish-language soap operas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;After the census we can expect tons of legal challenges, because in many ways it&rsquo;s a spoils system,&#8221; said Ellen Katz, a law professor at the University of Michigan who studies voting rights. &#8220;Everyone is grabbing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jorge A. Solis, a hispanic judge ruled on this, but his being hispanic had nothing to do with it. Sure. </p>
<p>How many times, do stories like this need to hit Americans across the nation in the face before they realize what is happening. There is no reconquista, or any danger of making the U.S. a hipanic culture, or any need to worry about Press 1 or 2 for, or even any North American Union. </p>
<p>Keep repeating these phrases and everything will be just swell  &mdash;   if you&rsquo;re the typical clueless American.</p>

		<p>The major institutions of this society are aiding and abetting the vicious race war that hispanics are waging against Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Only a corresponding Native Born White American political movement-White Nationalism-can reverse and defeat the hispanic  war against Native Born White Americans. Either  Native Born White Americans politically organize around their legitmate  racial interests or they will experience race-replacemenmt at the hand of post-1965 hispanics.</p>
<p>America will never survive the hispanic demographic time bomb. Hispanic &#8220;Americans&#8221; are  very serious threat to Native Born White Americans and to the ecosystems that sustain life within the borders of America. The future will be dystopic.</p>
<p>Now, if Native Born White Americans ever decide to fight back againsat their race replacement&hellip;this would trigger a race war.</p>
<p>Maybe California,Texas and Arizona have to be completetly destroyed before Native Born White Americans finally get the message.</p>

<p>Foolish U.S. whites:<br>
Did you really think that a &#8220;post-racial&#8221; U.S. meant anything else than <i>you</i>, and <i>you alone</i>, being culturally, ethnically, politically, socially and economically disenfranchised and dispossessed? That everyone would treat each other as &#8220;human beings&#8221;, and that &#8220;race&#8221; or &#8220;ethnicity&#8221; would magically become socially invisible?</p>
<p>If you thought either of the above, prepare yourself for a hell of a rude awakening as these same &#8220;[insert-minority-here] community activists&#8221; want a bigger slice of the pie at <i>your</i> expense.</p>

		<p>So the United States takes another step towards Balkanization. Reconquista is right around the corner. I just want to know what its going to take, what event is going to be big and loud enough to wake up White people? We&rsquo;re being colonized by third world peasants, not just from South America but from every non-white corner of the globe, at a time when Native Born Americans are living in tent cities. We have a non-U.S. born White hating Communist Muslim as our president. We subject young White people with constant anti-White brainwashing to the point were they feel ashamed to be White and think being a thug or from da &#8216;hood is something to aspire to. We have a government that will cut every service to balance the budget, EXCEPT services to people who shouldn&rsquo;t be here anyway. We allow blacks, 13% of the population, to terrorize 100% of the population.</p>
<p>Let me state that again. 13% of the population, yet how much political power to blacks wield? WHY?</p>
<p>Please, somebody tell me this is all a bad dream, or a satire gone horribly wrong. How much longer will Whites keep kowtowing to their black and hispanic masters? How many more areas can Whites flight to?</p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Hispanics to elect candidates of their own choosing.&rdquo;  He might as well have said &#8220;OUR choosing&#8221;.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that, even if this ruling were to be applied to whites, it still wouldn&rsquo;t matter; whites show no loyalty to their race anyway.  Unlike blacks and Hispanics, whites do not vote as a block.  So, because of the way whites vote compared to other groups, this ruling will have disparate impact on whites.  Doesn&rsquo;t this make it &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Hispanics are not politically mature. Hispanics are divisive and will not contribute to US economy but continue to take and demand, a sign of being ungrateful and uncivilised.<br>
Only white people can change this nonsense but Americans need to get politically active and start new proud &amp; pro American political parties. The Dems. and Reps. are repulsive and will continue to dilute white America in favour of chaos and declinism.</p>

		<p>Many on this boards constantly ask WHY Whites don&rsquo;t stand up for themselves and organize.  I cannot explain it better than this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A more mundane reason why White men do not stand up and assert their interests is that it is very costly to do so. Because of the triumph of the hostile intellectual and political elite in the West, those dissenting from the official orthodoxies are severely punished. They are socially ostracized and they may well lose their jobs if they speak out. </p>
<p>On the other hand, becoming a part of the hostile elite results in great rewards and is often a good career move for individualistic White men&hellip;&#8221; I would add (who then turn against their own).</p>
<p>Also from the same article &#8220;What&rsquo;s Wrong with White Men, In Search of an Explanation&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;However, there are also some rays of hope. Psychological research shows that whites continue to have an unconscious sense of white identity&hellip;Despite the constant bombardment of anti-white propaganda in the media, whites prefer to live and work with each other&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/lrebsg</p>
<p>How to overcome the constant bombardment of anti-White propaganda that is blasted at Whites from the moment of birth via the media and academia?</p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S what needs to be the focus of our attention and destroyed.</p>
<p>Also this from the above article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;For the first time, the census will send a bilingual questionnaire to 13 million Spanish-speaking homes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What is the efficacy of sending out questionnaires, in any language, to those who cannot read?</p>

		<p>These kind of stories make me wonder why we even bother with the pretense of democracy at all. </p>
<p>Democracy as a system of government, seems really obsolete in my opinion in most formerly white countries. I mean it was quaint idea when voting was based around &#8220;issues&#8221; and &#8220;ideas&#8221;, now we are supposed to vote for &#8220;Whoever looks like me!&#8221;, of course unless you are white, then you have to vote for whoever your people have most oppressed historically as atonement for your whiteness.</p>
<p>Seems to me it would be easier just to tally up each racial group, than simply appoint representatives of each racial group on a proportional basis. I could see this being implemented sooner or later since minorities vote less than whites (due to racism or perhaps the legacy of slavery of course) and the whole voting thing could be construed as having a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on minorities.</p>

<p>As for it being &#8220;too expensive,&#8221;  it&rsquo;s going to be more expensive the longer the fight against this is put off.  Whites should organize into groups and get tax dollars for their organization and get businesses  to support their efforts.  That&rsquo;s  exactly what black and mexican groups like LULAC, LaRaza, and the other dozens of anti-white organizations have done. Btw, Wal-mart is supposed to be the biggest supporter of LaRaza-betcha not a single white person would even stop shopping there or call to Wal-mart to complain once they find out-even tho&rsquo; LaRaza advocates getting rid of whites from the parts of America they claim belong to them known as &#8220;Aztlan.&#8221;  White people just won&rsquo;t organize and help each other out.  They worship everyone who is non-white and who is foreign.  All one has to do is go out and see a white paired up with a black, an asian or mexican-I see it all the time. The reason non-whties are taking over is for these very reasons-they are fiercely loyal to their own, they are organized and they know how to avail themselves to all the freebies that are offered in this country (one reason why the U.S. is going bankrupt), and they know how the system works and take advantage of it to the maximum.    </p>

		<p>The appropriate response to this is to wage a two front campaign. On the one hand, groups should oppose this on the grounds that is racially motivated. And, on the other hand, whites should try to exploit this for their own gains. That may sound hypocritical. But no one seems to be concerned about hypocrisy when it&rsquo;s whites who are getting the shaft.</p>

		<p>Hispanic Politics is NOT to be trusted and I&rsquo;ll tell you why:</p>
<p>Look at many Central and South American countries (Mexico being most notable) and what do you find? Corruption and greed and the nation&rsquo;s elite not giving a rat&rsquo;s tail about it&rsquo;s people.  No, they HOARD the wealth, and this in turn creates a desperate situation for the common people as many are forced to resort to not so legal methods of making a living etc (think drug cartels etc) or just plain immigration to countries like the U.S.A. and Canada.</p>
<p>These people want all this power, yet time and again it&rsquo;s a proven fact that the leaders of their respective nations are almost always corrupt, two-faced liars who are just after themselves.  Not that this isn&rsquo;t present in the U.S. and other civilized countries for example, but at least there are mechanisms in place to care for it&rsquo;s people (effectiveness of which notwithstanding).  You won&rsquo;t find any unemployment or welfare benefits in these countries is what I&rsquo;m trying to say.  </p>
<p>In my opinion, they are too far removed from Spain and its culture to even have a clue about what to do for it&rsquo;s people or its society.  <br>
