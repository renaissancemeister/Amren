<h1>Saudi Family Sues Genie, Alleges Harassment</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, July 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A family in Saudi Arabia has taken a genie to court, alleging theft and harassment, according to local media.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed in Shariah court accuses the genie of leaving them threatening voicemails, stealing their cell phones and hurling rocks at them when they leave their house at night, said Al-Watan newspaper.</p>
<p>An investigation was under way, local court officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to verify the truthfulness of this case despite the difficulty of doing so,&#8221; Sheikh Amr Al Salmi, the head of the court, told Al-Watan. &#8220;What makes this case and complaint more interesting is that it wasn&rsquo;t filed by just one person. Every member of the family is part of this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>The family, which has lived in the same house near the holy city of Medina for 15 years, said it became aware of the spirit in the past two years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A local charity has moved the family to a temporary residence while a court investigates, the newspaper said.</p>

		<p>Muslims actually believe garbage like this. I remember when college educated and supposidly intellegent Muslims would lose something in their house (like the car keys) and start screaming that the Jinn (genies in Western culture) have stolen them and hidden them somewhere.  </p>

		<p>I would like to see this case on &#8220;The People&rsquo;s Court&#8221;. That would be a riot. </p>
<p>I have nothing against Genies, especially if they look like Barbara Eden. I just don&rsquo;t like the Blue Gin. </p>
<p>I wonder if Jeannie could be sued in Sharia Court for blinking Major Nelson home fom his moon launch, because he had a cold? </p>
<p>Then she blinked home Commander Wingate, leaving Major Healy alone in the Rocket. </p>
<p>How would a Sharia Court handle this case?</p>
<p>I am going to my Office now, to lie down. </p>

We have people like this in Harlem.  When I worked at the 28th Precinct, we had people there who regularly made such complaints.</p>

		<p>There is a very good essay by Robert Godwin entitled &#8216;The Land that Developmental Time Forgot&rsquo;.  It goes some way to explain the paranoid and primitive thinking of these people.

		<p>Belief in &#8220;Jinns&#8221; (genies) is fairly widespread among muslims and Arabs in particular. The &#8216;prophet&rsquo; Muhammad firmly believed in them and some aspects of Islamic ritualism is designed to &#8220;counter&#8221; Jinns. Please see the book WHY I AM NOT A MUSLIM.</p>

		<p>Spectral evidence was a belief that existed in Europe. In the 1300s. In rural, uneducated areas. We have moved past that.</p>
<p>I think we need to realize the Islamic world is 700 years behind us and there is no co-existing with these people.</p>

<p>Absolutely correct! I know this first hand. It is the particular desire and agenda of the Wahabii sect of muslim to drag the civilized world back into the 6th century and Wahabii is the DOMINANT SECT IN SAUDI ARABIA!!!!!!</p>

		<p>BTW, I wonder how they propose to catch this genie and punish it? </p>
<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t the judges be afraid that the genie might retaliate and get even with THEM?    </p>
<p>I know if I were a Saudi judge, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to mess with an evil genie!!!</p>

<p>Try telling the Saudis that those things are myths..I believe in Jeannie of I dream of more than I believe in Congress/Senate doing the right thing. But you see what I mean, right.<br>

<p>I think Jinns are something like the Muslim/Arab version of fairies, brownies, or pixies, as opposed to the wish-granting, &#8220;trapped in a lamp&#8221; concept we have in the West.<br>
