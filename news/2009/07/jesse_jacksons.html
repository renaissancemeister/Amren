<h1><a href="http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/us_world/Jacksons-Bizarre-Political-Advice-.html">Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s Bizarre Political Advice</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert A. George, KNBC-TV (Los Angeles), July 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>So, has Jesse Jackson just, you know, lost his mind? One might think so after seeing his Sunday television appearance. For those that didn&rsquo;t, Jackson stated that President Obama needed to spend more time with black community leaders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This would be just a few days after the first black president gave speech to the NAACP that was, by turns, fiery, spiritual and inspiring. As Jackson himself noted, Obama has met with both the CBC and black mayors. Why on earth would he make plans to carve out time for more meetings with other self-styled black &#8220;leaders&#8221;? Why would he seek out Jesse Jackson in particular? Does Jesse think he still merits a prominent seat at the &#8220;political table&#8221;? Last year, he declared that Obama &#8220;talks down to blacks&#8221;  &mdash;  right before he shared his wish to, ahem, physically emasculate Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Indeed, most of the last decade has been fairly miserable. He&rsquo;s been, arguably, eclipsed as the go-to civil rights leader/African-American gadfly by Al Sharpton (who even ran for president trying to emulate him). For all of Jackson&rsquo;s attempts to horn in on the Michael Jackson funeral, Sharpton ended up delivering the eulogy (historically flawed though it might have been). Jesse ended up being relegated to taping public service announcements urging MJ fans not to commit suicide. {snip}</p>
<p>Of course, the 00&rsquo;s began with his embarrassing admission that he had fathered a child out of wedlock with a former Rainbow-PUSH staffer. That essentially kept him out of the public eye for months afterward  &mdash;  as well it should have.</p>
<p>The bad news extended to his son as well. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.&rsquo;s plans to run for statewide office in Illinois fell apart when he was implicated in the Rod Blagojevich sell-a-Senate-seat scandal. {snip} If Obama himself wasn&rsquo;t smart enough to know how to balance his meetings with quote-black-leaders-unquote and everybody else, you&rsquo;d better believe that advisers like Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod (and Valerie Jarrett too, for that matter) do. Enacting an explicitly &#8220;black&#8221; agenda is a sure-fire way to become a one-term president.</p>
<p>Obama was elected on the same premise  &mdash;  and promise  &mdash;  that all presidents are: To be president of all the people. One of the biggest obstacles Obama had to overcome with white voters was not old stereotypes based on intelligence or hard work, but rather a concern that he might &#8220;favor&#8221; African Americans in his policies. Listening to Jackson would relight all those same fears.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Jesse Jackson says Obama needs to spend more time with Jesse Jackson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really?  The last thing I heard come across the lips of Jesse Jackson was:  &#8220;I&rsquo;d like to cut his nuts off,&#8221; because Obama said blacks should take more responsibility.</p>
<p>Does Jesse intend to have a scalpel during the &#8220;time&#8221; he spends with Obama?</p>

		<p>I was a little puzzled when Sharpton and Jackson were still paid attention in the media after Obama&rsquo;s victory.  I honestly believed that Sharpton, Jackson et al were going to be put out of business after Obama became president.  Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s always been out of vogue for Whites but believe me that this off the wall, inarticulate, adulterous hypocrite poor excuse for a Minister has the backing of his gullible, conspiracy theory addicted followers.<br>
He expressed the desire to relieve Obama of his testicles with absolute impunity. Not even Obama called him on that. That was a clear &#8220;threat to do bodily harm&#8221; to another; obviously much more egregious than &#8220;Nappy headed Hoes&#8221; or &#8220;Black are less bouyant&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I remain amazed that Jesse Jackson has so much political adivce to give Obama or anyone else that will listen. Jesse Jackson has NEVER been elected to anything. His son, Jesse Jackson, Jr. has atleast been elected to the US House of Representatives. Why do blacks pay so much attention to this self-appointed spokesman of black people?</p>

		<p>Jesse criticized Bill Clinton as having &#8220;character flaws&#8221; before he was elected president (the Sista Souljah incident) then slobbered all over him after he was in the White House.</p>
<p>Jesse repeatedly slammed Dubya before he was elected (&#8220;Keep out of the Bushes!&#8221;)then offered to join his administration after he won, but was rebuffed.</p>
<p>Jesse slammed Obama before the election (the infamous &#8220;nuts&#8221; comment) but now demands that the new president collaborate w/him.</p>
<p>This man is audacious beyond belief and utterly without shame.    </p>

		<p>I would lament the exit of race-hustlers like Jackson and Sharpton. Obama tries to come off as &#8220;post-racial&#8221; while Jackson and his ilk will always remind liberal whites that no matter what they do it will NEVER be enough for blacks. Obama is giving the liberal whites the illusion that we have reached the post-racial promised land; Jackson and Sharpton (not to mention Blacks in general) will NEVER be satisfied and actually fear people like Obama. There&rsquo;s little that makes me happier than a frustrated liberal white complaining about how &#8220;even after all we&rsquo;ve done&#8221; they (blacks) still can&rsquo;t move on. I hope Jesse Jackson has a long and prosperous career! </p>

		<p>A lack of self-control in movie theatres is bad enough.  <br>
But a grown man who has NO control over his ego is a truly pathetic site.</p>
<p>Reminds me of when Jim Brown wanted to come out of retirement to put his rushing yards out of reach when Walter Payton was getting too close.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this episode is ALL about.</p>
