<h1><a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20630/20090713/">Couple Dubbed Racists in Son&rsquo;s Health Records</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local (Färögatan, Sweden), July 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A woman has reported a hospital in western Sweden to national authorities after discovering she and her husband had been described as racists in their son&rsquo;s medical records.</p>
<p>The woman filed a claim against Norra Älvsborg municipal hospital to Sweden&rsquo;s Medical Responsibility Board (Hälso-och sjukvårdens ansvarsnämnd  &mdash;  HSAN), a national authority that assesses medical negligence, after discovering that she and her husband had been described as racists in their son&rsquo;s medical charts, reported TTELA newspaper.</p>
<p>Three years ago, when the son was five months old, the woman rushed the boy to the hospital in an ambulance. At the hospital, they encountered a foreign doctor whom the woman was unable to understand. She asked to see a Swedish-speaking doctor, and her request was granted.</p>
<p>When she recently requested her son&rsquo;s medical journal, she read that she and her husband had were described as racists in the notations.</p>
<p>Hospital management is also of the opinion that the notation was inappropriate.</p>
<p>The woman has also reported the doctor to the police for slander, and submitted a request to the National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) to have her son&rsquo;s medical journal destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not racists; we just didn&rsquo;t understand what the doctor said,&#8221; the mother told TTELA, adding that the notation had absolutely nothing to do with her son&rsquo;s medical condition.</p>
<p>She furthermore wondered if it had affected the family&rsquo;s treatment during subsequent visits to the same hospital.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s Ok to mark on there they are racists. Just not whether they have AIDS or not. No one needs to know that. It would be evil, wanting to know. </p>

		<p>This is the phenomenon known as,</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom the gods destroy they first make mad&#8221;.</p>
<p>Imagine a White Swede or Swedes labeling a fellow White Swede a  racist and placing the label in - of all things - a medical record for their son simply because that White Swede requested a doctor  who was a Swede.</p>
<p>No other race labels members of their own race - &#8216;racists&rsquo;.  Only, repeat ONLY Whites.</p>
<p>Wake up White people.</p>

		<p>Oh no! I&rsquo;m probably a racist too! I hung up on someone who may have been from India. I was trying to get a new cell phone operational and I tried, I swear I really tried, to understand what they were saying, but I just couldn&rsquo;t. I felt terrible! I sheepishly asked them to repeat what they were saying once, and then even twice on more than three occasions. I guess I panicked! I hung up. Looking back, I know I didn&rsquo;t try hard enough. I wish life could give you a second chance. I feel terrible!</p>

		<p>I must be in the clear then&hellip;once at the ATM I accidentally hit the Spanish button and continued with my transaction because I can read Spanish!  LOL</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ll bet this doctor thought he was doing a public service.  He saw this woman&rsquo;s request for a doctor who spoke her language as an insult to his cultural heritage, and he was sure that all of his schoolteachers would&rsquo;ve backed him up on that.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been my experience that any foreign doctor in less than a specialized hospital in a difficult specialty is sub-standard. Many highly specialized doctors in intricate fields in the top notch hospitals are excellent physicians and I would not hesitate to use them. However, foreign doctors working in HMO or walk-in clinics, small towns, and local hospitals I avoid like the plague. </p>

		<p>Remarkable even for seemingly hopeless Scandinavians. Neighborhood spies in communist (or formerly communist) nations at least worked under some system of incentives; these fools are compiling lists of witches and heretics for no discernible reason other than to enforce the anti-white systems of taboos they&rsquo;ve internalized. How did the descendants of the Vikings come to this?</p>

This could have much more damaging implications in Sweden than it would have here.<br>
And of course, being branded as a &#8220;racist&#8221; in Sweden is almost the most awful thing you could be   &mdash;   next to being a serial killer.  Surely a death knell to anyone&rsquo;s career or social life.</p>
<p>According to a friend of mine who has some close Swedish friends, the official concept of privacy is  very different from what we know here.   In Sweden, the term &#8220;public records&#8221; means exactly that   &mdash;   public!   Anybody can go and look at whatever they want:  your school records, or whatever.   Being a socialist country, and under socialist governments for such a long time now   &mdash;   about a century   &mdash;   they don&rsquo;t have the same privacy laws that we have, and they don&rsquo;t have the same conception of privacy either.</p>
