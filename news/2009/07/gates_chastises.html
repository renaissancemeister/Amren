<h1>Gates Chastises Officer After Authorities Agree to Drop Criminal Charge <font color="red">(UPDATED)</font></h1>

<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gates [Henry Louis Gates Jr.] accused the officer who arrested him at his Cambridge home of having a &#8220;broad imagination&#8221; when he summarized last Thursday&rsquo;s confrontation in police reports, and he denied making several inflammatory remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the police officer should apologize to me for what he knows he did that was wrong,&#8221; Gates said in a phone interview from his other home in Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. &#8220;If he apologizes sincerely, I am willing to forgive him. And if he admits his error, I am willing to educate him about the history of racism in America and the issue of racial profiling .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That&rsquo;s what I do for a living.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Middlesex district attorney&rsquo;s office announced plans to drop criminal charges against Gates. The City of Cambridge and the police department recommended today that prosecutors not pursue charges in a joint statement from authorities and Gates that called the confrontation &#8220;regrettable and unfortunate.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons said in a statement that the controversy illustrated &#8220;that Cambridge must continue finding ways to address matters of race and class in a frank, honest, and productive manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This afternoon in an interview, Gates said he never yelled at the officer other than to demand his name and badge number, which he said the officer refused to give. The officer, Sergeant James Crowley, said in the police report that he did state his name. He also said Gates unleashed a verbal tirade, calling him racist, telling him that he did not know who he was messing with, and threatening to speak to his &#8220;mama&#8221; outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police report is full of this man&rsquo;s broad imagination,&#8221; Gates said in response to a question on whether he had said any of the quotes in the report. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Are you not giving me your name and badge number because I&rsquo;m a black man in America?&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He treated my request with scorn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was suffering from a bronchial infection. I couldn&rsquo;t have yelled .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.. I don&rsquo;t walk around calling white people racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gates continued, &#8220;I&rsquo;m outraged. I shouldn&rsquo;t have been treated this way but it makes me so keenly aware of how many people every day experience abuses in the criminal justice system .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No citizen should tolerate that kind of poor behavior by an officer of the law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is really about justice for the least amongst us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of his arrest, Gates said he plans to make racial profiling and prison reform central intellectual and political issues he wants to explore. He&rsquo;s also considering a new documentary on racial profiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the capricious whim of one disturbed person .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am now a black man with a prison record,&#8221; Gates said. &#8220;You can look at my mug shot on the Internet.&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="/us/article/2009/07/21/05/0301-82/index.xml">Racism in Prof Arrest?</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Greg St. Martin, Metro International (New York), July 21, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Renowned African-American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. accused a Cambridge police officer of racism after being questioned by cops investigating a call about a break-in at his home, according to various news reports.</p>
<p>Gates, a 58-year-old Harvard University professor who has worked on numerous acclaimed PBS programs, was arrested outside his house on Ware Street in Cambridge Thursday for disorderly conduct. {snip}</p>
<p>When police arrived, an officer saw Gates trying to get into the house. When the officer asked to speak with him about a report of a possible break-in, Gates exclaimed, &#8220;Why, because I&rsquo;m a black man?&#8221; and called the officer a racist, according to the police report.</p>
<p>Gates initially refused to identify himself and when he continued to yell at the officer, he was warned about his &#8220;tumultuous&#8221; behavior and was later arrested, according to the report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gates contends he returned home from a trip to China to find his front door damaged. So he went in through the back door, turned off an alarm and got help from his driver to force open the front door. He claims when police arrived, he identified himself properly but the officer initially didn&rsquo;t do the same.<br>

		<p>My god, can you imagine just how bad it must be for black men in 2009 in Cambridge Mass?  Probably just like Selma in 1964.  This cop must be lying.  Can you imagine how preposterous it sounds that a Harvard Afro-american studies professor would berate an officer of the law with charges of racism.  I think we know just how careful blacks and the left are not to overuse that word.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Because of the capricious whim of one disturbed person &hellip; I am now a black man with a prison record,&rdquo; Gates said. &ldquo;You can look at my mug shot on the Internet.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>He should re-phrase that to the truth: &#8220;Because of my own arrogant, &#8220;uppity,&#8221; attitude&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all innocent and they&rsquo;re always right.  Espeically the incarcerated ones.  The educated ones are just as ignorant of what a civil society is.  Gates is no different.<br>

		<p>A woman had called police because of suspicious behavior (a guy trying to get in the front door and then going around back).  If the police HADN&rsquo;T investigated and Gates had been robbed, Gates would be screaming racism then, too.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t doubt Gates a) refused to show his ID when asked, and b) called the officer a racist because the officer was doing his job.</p>
<p>If this officer apologizes to this race-baiting so and so I&rsquo;ll be deeply disappointed.</p>

		<p>ROFLMAO&hellip; I hope they school the white officers into never asking a black person questions again. (If they are on his property that is) Now any black person should be able to bust into the intelligent professors house and not worry about being arrested. They police should assume because they are black they are innocent and wouldn&rsquo;t want to profile them. This should get good. Any black criminal who knows about this incident should rob this mans house. The cops could just say they seen a blackman at his house but didn&rsquo;t want to profile, so they kept on their merry way. Professor Boob just gave a liscence to all black people to come rob his house because he didn&rsquo;t want to cooperate and decided to turn it into a racial issue. LOL!</p>

		<p>The only thing about this incident I KNOW for a certainty is that this man is in no way qualified to be teaching at a major university.</p>
<p>I wish I could read something from one of them that was on a par with Thomas Sowell or Alan Keyes, but I haven&rsquo;t, because, unless I&rsquo;ve missed one or two, every one of them has been awarded his/her job as an affirmative action offering.</p>

		<p>     From what I have read, he refused to cooperate with the police at all. He had a belligerent attitude from the start.Either he was exhibiting an elitist or a racial bias when confronted with someone he considered beneath him. I have found that if you treat the police with respect, you&rsquo;ll get respect in return. If a cop tells me to do something, I do it. I&rsquo;m not looking for trouble. The time to argue is in court in front of a judge.</p>

		<p>If you want a laugh, or a cry, read comments about this story on MSM and black oriented sites. Blacks are outraged, absolutely outraged, that the police didn&rsquo;t recognize the &#8220;respected scholar&#8221; as if the police spend a hour a day studying pictures of &#8220;respected scholars&#8221; that live in the area.</p>
<p>I mean, they probably do, but only so they can conspire against them, if they aren&rsquo;t white. Thats what us whites do.</p>

		<p>Given his resistance to arrest and his foul language to the Police, the esteemed professor of &#8216;African American&#8221; history is lucky his esteemed skull wasn&rsquo;t cracked by the Cambridge police. Does he realize he probably was treated lightly because he was black and the cops know damn well, especially in a liberal city like Cambridge, in a liberal state like Massachusetts, that a civil rights suit head their way if they muss the feelings of some one of African American heritage.</p>

		<p>gates is the biggest racist of all. just google the harvard w.e. dubois school of african and african american studies, where gates is the director, and you will see the most anti-white racist place in america. google noel ignatiev, a white profesor at that school, and google his magazine called &#8220;race traitor&#8221;, which advocates the elimination of the white race. this gates and his harvard school are all racist to the core, yet they continue to blame other people of racism. if i were these cops i would not ever try to protect his property again. i would make him pay me for police protection. also, if i were the cop, i would resign immediately, and tell them to shove it.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not often we get to read a word like &#8220;tumultuous&#8221; in a news story.</p>
<p>All this professor had to do was be polite to the cops, &amp; it would have been over quickly. Instead, he yelled at them &amp; insulted them. That&rsquo;s never a wise thing to do, regardless of your skin tone or standing in the community.  </p>
<p>Verbally abusing cops is like putting your hand in the lion&rsquo;s cage.  It also demonstrates one&rsquo;s general level of intelligence; is anyone surprised that he got a failing grade?   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve run into an overzealous police officer on occasion. However, I managed to avoid arrest not because I&rsquo;m white but because I kept my mouth shut and complied with the officer&rsquo;s instructions. The officer was doing his job. He doesn&rsquo;t know whether or not one is a criminal until he investigates. The officer was right to treat Gates as a suspect. And Gates was wrong to resent it. If someone has a problem with an officer&rsquo;s conduct they should handle it in court - not on the street. If Gates had been anyone else, white or black, those charges wouldn&rsquo;t have been dropped.</p>

		<p>I believe the officer is better qualifed and should educate the esteemed Mr.Gates on how glad he should be that a citizen called the police when observing a person breaking in a house. Only in PC America is this nonsense not only permitted,it is encouraged. I`m sure Rev. Al is chomping at the bit at this one. It will be fun to watch the spineless whites comment on how bad he was treated. What excatly does this fellow teach anyhow? I bet its rocket science.</p>

		<p>I read this story in the news.  A neighbor called the cops because she saw a couple men breaking into the house.  (Gates is a renter, so I suppose she didn&rsquo;t recognize him.)  The cops come and find Gates breaking in.  Apparently, Gates feels that the first thing every cop should do when it seems he&rsquo;s caught a bandit red-handed is exchange IDs.  I don&rsquo;t know anything about this Gates other than he&rsquo;s a celebrity professor, but I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s a jackass.  Anyone, especially an intelligent Black man, ought know that if you are seen breaking into a house, or any other apparently criminal activity, you ought be ready with an explanation if the cops show up.  </p>
<p>When I was about 24, I bought some Snap-On tools and then, being on a motorcycle, carried them with me into a mall, which I entered through Sears.  Two cops, working second jobs as store security, snapped the cuffs on me as I exited the store into the mall.  After a walk to the security office, the error was discovered and I was released.  No problem.  Grow up, Mr Gates.</p>

		<p>In a more enlightened time, a White man could not hope to get justice as long as two or three &#8220;Blacks&#8221; who were involved in an altercation against him stuck to their &#8220;story&#8221;. After all, it was just his word against two or three of theirs. In today&rsquo;s superstitious age, it just takes the word of one.</p>

		<p>I read the actual police report and clearly, this &#8220;professor&#8221; has learned nothing in his academic research. He deserved to be arrested - he behaved like a moron and a criminal. For years he was likely coddled and given special Ivy League treatment in spite of his affirmative action job and mediocre abilities. When he was not accorded the proper deference he felt his inflated ego deserved he began to cry &#8220;racism.&#8221; Seriously, if I saw two black men breaking into the house next door I&rsquo;d call the police, too.</p>
<p>If he had any brains this never would have escalated into a national story. While he sees publicity the majority of Americans only see another incoherent black man - he does nothing to advance the cause of his people. </p>
<p>Perhaps he should ask himself why exactly the police were suspicious. </p>

<p>Come now, Professor Gates!   Isn&rsquo;t that essentially what you do for a living?  </p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve done very nicely at it too, haven&rsquo;t you?  <br>
If not for that, you wouldn&rsquo;t even be famous and we wouldn&rsquo;t even know who you are. You wouldn&rsquo;t be in the news and we wouldn&rsquo;t be reading about hou here.</p>
<p>I am so, so sick of people like this using race as an alibi for everything.  It&rsquo;s a one-excuse-fits-all solution for getting out of any tight spot when they find themselves in a jam.  &#8220;Racism&#8221; should be ruled out as a valid legal excuse for anything, and the world not even permitted in the courtroom.   They need to be deprived of this &#8220;crutch&#8221; so that they will have to face the world on the same basis as the rest of us and accept responsibility for their own actions as any mature person should.</p>

		<p>The  rambling story is somewhat garbled, but it appears that someone called the police to report an attempted break-in.</p>
<p>Gates should be appreciative that the police responded promptly and professionally.   After all, IT WAS TO HIS OWN INTEREST, and it was his property that they were protecting!  Instead of getting all high and mighty with them, he should have been cooperative and thankful they were there.</p>
<p>They were investigating a suspected burglary by a described black man.  Of course they would confront him!  What else did he expect - that they should fall to their knees in awe at the sight of him?   Some of these pompous Neros are just too much!</p>

Mr. Gates has been waiting 58 years for this. After 58 years on this planet, he finally gets his own racist incident. Now he has street cred.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to find out how many such incidents Mr. Gates has suffered living in the worlds racist country. Maybe this one is the tipping point and he&rsquo;ll turn his back on the white man and find refuge with his own black brothers.<br>

 &ldquo;Earlier today, the Middlesex district attorney&rsquo;s office announced plans to drop criminal charges against Gates. The City of Cambridge and the police department recommended today that prosecutors not pursue charges in a joint statement from authorities and Gates that called the confrontation &ldquo;regrettable and unfortunate.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wonder if Deval Patrick had anything to do with this?<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>With a black governor in the state house, a black president in the White House, and a black Attorney General in the Justice Dept, it seems Prof. Gates has all the odds  thoroughly stacked in his favor, racially speaking.  Of course the charges were dismissed.  And yet, blacks endlessly complain that they are powerless and oppressed and held down!   How much longer is that phony excuse going to wash?</p>
<p>And as for Mayor Denise Simmons, I checked, and she&rsquo;s black too.  Surprise!  <br>
(The first black lesbian mayor in America. Her predecessor was black too, but he was only a gay male.)<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been hassled in front of my own house before, sitting in an old jalopy and conversing with a friend. I explained politely to the cop that this was my house I was sitting in front of, and he apologized and explained that it looked a little suspicious and that he was just trying to do his job. I showed him my ID, just to confirm. End of issue.</p>
<p>It NEVER goes that way with blacks. They have a true genius for turning a routine Q&A; session into an altercation.</p>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s Ole Massa, the US government, or Harvard university, everything&rsquo;s still being provided for him.  At the age of 58, this man is still living on hand-outs.   All of the rest of us have to find lodgings of our own.  </p>

		<p>if the next day, someone else who is black, tries to break into his house, and the police are called and notified and decide NOT to investigate, with the result being that Gates home has been robbed of its valuables, wouldnt he complain the police were racist for not protecting him ?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have it both ways   &mdash;  - either the job of the police is to respond to something that looks suspicious or it is the job of the police to NOT respond to something that looks suspicious, so long as the person acting suspicious is black.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t entering a house without a key, suspicious ?<br>
Wouldnt the same thing happen to ANYONE of ANY RACE based on identical behavior ?<br>
Therefore, the police were not racist.<br>
But Gates was racist in painting with a broadbrush, the police department as only responding to him as a black rather than someone who obviously was doing something VERY SUSPICIOUS (even if it was his house&hellip;usually people enter houses through the front door)</p>

		<p>two things you need to know to understand the story:</p>
<p>1) Cambridge Mass. has a serious black crime problem, with gangs, drugs, etc. </p>
<p>2) the last time racism was an issue at Harvard a black student was questioned by guards and Harvard yard while trying to break a bike lock (it was his bike).</p>
<p>in other words:<br>
when whites are assaulted or killed by feral blacks in the streets of Cambridge, it is swept under the rug, and if you mention it you are a fascist</p>
<p>At the same time, the most trivial incident is seized upon as an opportunity for Harvard University to do some more soul-searching on its incorrigible racism.</p>
<p>we should be grateful it&rsquo;s Henry Louis Gates instead of Cornell West, the clownish and ridiculous mascot of the race industry in America, who has bounced back to Princeton, leaving Gates to fill his shoes, staging grotesque histrionics at any and every opportunity.</p>
<p>white and Asian scholars at Harvard to topics as diverse as oceanography, astronomy, cancer research, Beethoven&rsquo;s symphonies, Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets, metallurgy, musicology, and architectural history.</p>
<p>all the black ones seem to have the same specialty:<br>
telling white people how racist they are.</p>

If he is disrespected by the police at all, it will be by his own, so at least he can&rsquo;t imagine that it&rsquo;s due to racism.</p>

________________________<br>
Same here. I locked myself out of my house (in my bathrobe &amp; slippers, yet!) one cold morning a few winters back. I had to go in through the bathroom window, so the neighbors on that side,  not having a very clear view of WHO was going in the window called the police. When the policemen showed up and knocked on my door, they asked who I was, looked at my ID, said sorry for the bother, have a nice day, ma&rsquo;am, and left. This Gates person, on the other hand had to refuse to show his ID, and turn a simple, routine check into a racial case with Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson all over it. He SHOULD have been glad that the police were on the ball enough to come and see if his home, person and property was safe. Most people would be, but his reaction was sheer lunacy. I will NEVER understand African thinking.   </p>

		<p>FOLLOWUP COMMENT BASED ON NEW INFORMATION PROVIDED ABOVE BY AMREN:  </p>
<p>This Harvard genius can&rsquo;t even get his status straight. He is not a black man with a prison record. He was arrested and quickly released. Never admitted to prison. Just has a nice mug shot like many of us pulled over for driving when we shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that he was not charged with assault on an officer and obstruction of justice, so the possibility and his dream apparently of this black man with a &#8220;prison record&#8221; could come true. </p>
<p>This condescending also offers to educate the officer about racism because that&rsquo;s what he does for a living (he says). No, &#8220;Skip&#8221;, what you do for a living is to shake down liberal foundations and guilty rich whites for millions to fund your phony Marxist Leninist front, the Dubois institute at Harvard. </p>
<p>Of course Dubois was a prominent Communist, supporter of Stalin and the Soviet Union, and enemy of the US and the liberties it guarantees to its citizens. </p>
<p>Gates is a bum who couldn&rsquo;t get a job in a real academic History department that studies truly important trends in human history.<br>
So he invented AfroAmerican studies and hundreds of colleges waste taxpayer and donor money on it every year. How much black money is donated to Harvard for this bogus program compared with white money, Skipster?  Bet you&rsquo;ll be on the fundraising circuit soon as you can say &#8220;Jackie Robinson&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that if the situation were reversed and whites had the legacy of violence, crime and behavior patterns  that blacks currently do statistically, and blacks generally had a history of lawfulness, self sufficiency and responsibility that whites are associated with, that many [incorrect] assumptions would still be made about white guilt and black innocence; just in the opposite direction. When a pattern is widely known and backed up by statistics over a long period of time, assumptions are made, because more often than not the assumption is true. If blacks didn&rsquo;t have the reputation they do due to years of their own behavior, perhaps Prof. Gates wouldn&rsquo;t have been instinctively assumed to be a criminal. It&rsquo;s wrong, and I feel for the man, but that&rsquo;s human nature.</p>

		<p>In my town the police have little recording devices in their shirt pocket - so small you can not even see a shirt bulge.  Record everything you and the officer say to each other.  I found this out after a fender bender and asked the policeman what if the other guy decides to change his story the next day.  He patted his shirt and said it is all recorded.  With all the tiny MP3 devises out there it doesn&rsquo;t seem too expensive to let a cop record all interactions with the public.  That way when some snot causes a ruckus the cop is covered!</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily take the side of someone so obviously against whites, but having read Gates&rsquo; heartfelt telling of the story I started to think there might be something to it. Then I read the police report. The police report strikes me as much more believable than Gates&rsquo; version. Too bad very few will ever read it and that the arresting officer&rsquo;s career is likely in danger. To expect that the media give similar exposure to the police report that they give Gates&rsquo; tale of victimhood is, of course, laughable.<br>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a VERY interesting police report that has now been added to the article. Everyone whould read it.</p>
<p>Given the powers that be, from the President and Attorney General right down to the State Governor and the Mayor of Cambridge, all black, (not to mention meddlesome outsiders like Jesse Jackson), it looks like everything will be covered up and made good for &#8220;Professor&#8221; Gates.</p>
<p>However, it looks like that police sergeant is finished. An encounter with someone like Gates is any cop&rsquo;s nightmare   &mdash;   and a career terminator. Answering that call will prove to be the worst mistake of his career, maybe the end of it.  He must wish he had called in sick that day!  If he&rsquo;s not fired outright (either now or later) on some trumped up charge, or shifted to some intolerable assignment on midnights forever more, his career will be at the least frozen and he will never see a promotion or get a decent evaluation again. That is how it works in politically correct bureaucracies.</p>

<p>Feller is right.  Gates is misrepresenting the matter for the sake of dramatizing  and exaggerating his case.  Lying would be an accurate word.</p>
<p>He could have been charged with resisting arrest, striking an officer, obstructing justice, interfering with governmental administration, and many others -  if the police really wanted to get creative.  Therefore, the minor infraction that he was charged with showed that they were going easy on him. They just booked him and let him go on his own recognizance.</p>
<p>They could have checked his car for parking violations and a zillion other infractions. Surely they would have found some.   They could have checked his home for fire hazards, electrical violations, zoning infractions. Were there drugs present?  Kiddie porn?  At the very least, they could have done a thorough search that left the place in a shambles. </p>
<p>It has been known to happen.  He was lucky.</p>

		<p>Everyone here pretty much agrees that this is a law enforcement matter.</p>
<p>The one main reason black crime rate tends to be high, is because blacks they use the race card and the police are afraid to do there job because of the potential legal ramifications. I see it here in my own community. Especially now that Obama is in office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mob rule&#8221; has replaced law and order. </p>

		<p>It was no mistake that the staged, scripted question regarding Gates disorderly conduct arrest (NOT the false narrative used by Obama that Gates was arrested for breaking into his own home) came up at the tail end of the Obamacare news conference.<br>
 <br>
In Obama&rsquo;s mind Gates should have received a big ol&rsquo; fist bump and &#8220;carry on brotha&#8221; and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t give Obama the same on his Health care plan - anyone who dares questions him is acting stupidly.<br>
 <br>
 Gates flips out and starts verbally abusing the cops for doing their job.<br>
 <br>
Obama flips out the race card to distract from his failing presidency.<br>

		<p>Rush thinks that Dr. Gates wanted to be arrested, to create a civil rights controversy, and because he has a rivalry with fellow Harvard Prof Cornell West, who has had more of the spotlight lately.</p>
<p>I think this could be so true to the point that Dr. Gates deliberately locked himself out of the house, used an advantageously placed crowbar, and wanted a neighbor to call the cops.</p>

		<p>Obama makes it sound like the police were out to get Gates, and seeing that they couldn&rsquo;t charge him with breaking and entering since his ID showed he lived there, they decided to slap a disorderly conduct charge on him:</p>
<p>&#8220;But my understanding is, is that Professor Gates then shows his ID to show that this is his house. And at that point he gets arrested for disorderly conduct&#8221;</p>
<p>( according to the police report, and to news reports, he was arrested only after he continued to become more disorderly).</p>

<p>1) Cambridge Mass. has a serious black crime problem, with gangs, drugs, etc.</p>
<p>Excellent!!!!, Just like Columbia, University of Chicago, Yale and so many other universities surrounded by black neighborhoods.  But the white liberal and communists would rather suffer rape, murder, robberies and danger from blacks than admit the truth.</p>
<p>The best is City College of New York.  Once one of the best free public universities.  It has now been totally destroyed by neighboring black thugs and affirmative action black students and faculty.</p>
<p>But for decades, starting in the thirties, CCNY was a haven of pro black anti White, anti American White communists and liberals who dstroyed their own school.</p>
<p>I love it when liberals get what they deserve.  Think of all the white man hating feminazis who are afraid to walk home 2 blocks or use public transportation for fear of what their beloved black comrades will do if they are caught out on the street alone.</p>
<p>Good news at last!  Hopefully the Cambridge cops will stop stopping and questioning the black predators as they roam Cambridge looking for rich white liberals to murder, rape, rob and burglarize.  Maybe the thugs will even get an affirmative action attorney or Judge!!!!! <br>

		<p>&#8220;If he&rsquo;s not fired outright (either now or later) on some trumped up charge, or shifted to some intolerable assignment on midnights forever more, his career will be at the least frozen and he will never see a promotion or get a decent evaluation again. That is how it works in politically correct bureaucracies.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.  They will start observing his every minute action, work and expression.  They&rsquo;ll wait about 6 months and then charge him with some bogus offense and reprimand him with of course full documentation.  Then will come another reprimand.  Then on the third offense he will be fired.  He won&rsquo;t be able to fight back, after all with 2 reprimands and counseling sessions they gave him every chance to improve his preformance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just bureacucies that do this.  It&rsquo;s very prevalent in the private sector.  It&rsquo;s how HR nazis get rid of Americans to make way for non White immigrants, both legal and illegal.</p>

<p>From the police report, it appears that Gates started screeching as soon as the police car stopped in front of the house.</p>

		<p>Uh, law professor Obama, he wasn&rsquo;t arrested for breaking and entering. Duhhhhhh. </p>
<p>Neighbors were gathered outside and witnessed a lot of what happened&hellip;.will they be interviewed by the media??????<br>
  &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;    </p>
<p>I wonder if they are employees of (or connected with) Harvard?  That&rsquo;s highly likely.<br>
It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if they decline to comment (or if we will ever know that).</p>
<p>Incidentally, one further point:  it wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;his own&#8221; house (as so many reports have stated). It&rsquo;s not.   It&rsquo;s Harvard&rsquo;s house, and he&rsquo;s being allowed to use it.  The rest of us common folks have to provide our own housing. Not special persons such as he.</p>

<p>Could that have been a reason the sergeant, seeing how this was escalating, asked Gates to step outside?  </p>
<p>At least there were witnesses outside.  Inside, anything could have happened, and it would have been solely Gate&rsquo;s word against the cop&rsquo;s.  Given that the cop &#8220;didn&rsquo;t know who he was messin&rsquo; with&#8221;  (Gates&rsquo; own threat), that surely seemed the wiser thing to do&hellip; to take this out in public.  I would have done the same.</p>
