<h1>Achievement Gap Still Splits White, Black Students</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Libby Quaid, AP, July 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite unprecedented efforts to improve minority achievement in the past decade, the gap between black and white students remains frustratingly wide, according to an Education Department report released Tuesday.</p>
<p>There is good news in the report: Reading and math scores are improving for black students across the country. But because white students are also improving, the disparity between blacks and whites has lessened only slightly.</p>
<p>On average, the gap narrowed by about 7 points from 1992 to 2007, so that black students scored about 28 points behind white students on a 500-point scale.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The gap exists even before kids start school. But schools don&rsquo;t mitigate the problem, said Kati Haycock, president of the Education Trust, a children&rsquo;s advocacy group.</p>
<p>&#8220;African-American students are less likely than their white counterparts to be taught by teachers who know their subject matter,&#8221; Haycock said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are less likely to be exposed to a rich and challenging curriculum,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And the schools that educate them typically receive less state and local funding than the ones serving mainly white students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Closing the achievement gap was a central element of the 2002 No Child Left Behind law, which holds schools accountable for progress among every group of kids  &mdash;  including minorities, those who have disabilities and those who are learning English.</p>
<p>The gap between black and white students shrank by 2 points after 2003, when accountability measures under No Child Left Behind took effect.</p>
<p>The implications of the disparity reach far beyond school walls. Minority students are also much more likely to drop out of high school  &mdash;  half of minorities drop out, compared to about 30 percent of students overall. The future is bleak for dropouts; they are the only segment of the workforce whose income levels shrank over the past 30 years, according to the children&rsquo;s advocacy group America&rsquo;s Promise Alliance.</p>
<p>A huge percentage of minority students lack the simple skills they need to function in society, said Hugh Price, professor at Princeton&rsquo;s Woodrow Wilson School and a former president of the Urban League.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report found that states generally mirrored the national trend.</p>
<p>The findings constitute the first major Education Department report since President Barack Obama took office, though it was done by the agency&rsquo;s nonpartisan research arm, the Institute of Education Sciences. The report was based on test results from nationwide assessments from the early 1990s to 2007.</p>
<p>A separate report comparing Hispanic and white children is due out next fall.<br>

		<p>There was a white liberal St. Louis on again off again talk radio host, that sat aside another on again off again black obsessive named Onion Horton.  The white one&rsquo;s name was/is Mark Kasen.  He said one thing that I agreed with   &mdash;   if you move an urban public school system to the suburbs, the teachers, buildings, administrators, books, etc., but don&rsquo;t bring the students, and use the suburban area&rsquo;s students, you would have a great school district.  Vice versa, move the suburb&rsquo;s school district to the city, you&rsquo;d have a crummy school district.</p>
<p>All Kasen did was to endorse the racial differences in intelligence truisms that he would otherwise deny day in and day out.</p>

<p>There are 2 options here:</p>
<p>1) acknowledge reality, and stop applying the same objectives to different peoples</p>
<p>2) just artificially create the outcomes you desire, and dispense with the sham processes involved to make it seem that any merit is involved.</p>

		<p>It is now an accepted fact known to all (except education workers) that IQ is largely inherited, much the same way skin color and the ability to metabolize lactose are.  No amount of praying, singing, marching, holding hands, or expensive social programs will alter skin color or lactose-intolerance.  There is nothing that we can do about it.  Likewise, no matter what we do, Africans (who have a very low IQ) and their children and their grandchildren will continue to have low IQ&rsquo;s and fail at school and technical careers, while NE Asians (who have high IQ&rsquo;s) will continue to be successful.  </p>
<p>Basing cures on the wrong cause if fruitless.  It is time that we accepted the truth, and found alternative ways to ease the problems of low IQ.  </p>

		<p>This is shocking, absolutely shocking! Another report that confirms whites do better in school than blacks? Maybe we need to fund 10 more, or so, just to confirm the results. We also need to make sure that all studies find a way to blame whites, rather than place the blame on blacks, because that would be wrong. Beside, wasn&rsquo;t Comrade Obama&rsquo;s presidency suppose to make blacks excel in school?</p>
<p>As far as dropouts having a bleak future, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it. I&rsquo;m sure they can find jobs as Congressional aides.</p>

		<p>First issue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite unprecedented efforts to improve minority achievement in the past decade, the gap between black and white students remains frustratingly wide, according to an Education Department report released Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is also equally frustrating that we do not have a colony on Mars yet, or have traveled to the Andromeda Galaxy. That is with one qualifier however; we may one day have Mars terra-formed or be zipping about Andromeda, when technology and science have achieved harmoniously feasible applications in those directions, but no matter how much social engineering is engaged in, the races will never see such compatibility or &ldquo;equality.&rdquo; That is a truth that must be accepted, in the same way that it is acknowledged that a rhino and a hamster are not equals. Until that point of reason and reality is readopted, we will suffer as a country.</p>
<p>Second issue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A separate report comparing Hispanic and white children is due out next fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh boy, I really am in a state of almost unendurable anticipation for the &ldquo;results&rdquo; of that study. Sort of the way that I wring my hands every morning, when I wonder if the sun will come up again; particularly, when dawn breaks and the sky gets that funny orange/purple/pink hue to it.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>The purpose of No Child Left Behind, and indeed of the federal Department of Education as a whole, is to create jobs for leftist idiots who couldn&rsquo;t earn a living in the private sector. By admitting that the IQ gap is largely hereditary, they&rsquo;d be breaking their own rice bowl. Ed majors aren&rsquo;t terribly bright as a rule, but they&rsquo;re not that stupid, even the black ones. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Paige" rel="nofollow">Rod Paige</a>, Dubya&rsquo;s first Secretary of Education, had sense enough to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/06/60II/main591676.shtml" rel="nofollow">cook his books</a>. Option 2 above is and will be the norm.</p>

		<p>The sad thing is, even if blacks are, in general, the least intelligent race they could do better than they do if only blacks would admit to a couple of universal truths.  1) Children born to married parents who emotionally support each other and 2) children who are disciplined and taught to respect authority and 3) children whose parents show an interest in their education will always fair better academically than their ghetto peers.</p>
<p>Many years ago a black woman told me &#8220;black women LOVE babies but can&rsquo;t stand children&#8221;.<br>

		<p>We are already spending, contrary to NAACP propaganda, more per capita on black students than white students in similar metro areas. This report will trigger demands to spend more on black students. </p>
<p>Remember, Obama&rsquo;s white Education Secretary Arnie Duncan was superintenant for at least a decade in the Chicago public schools. Except for a couple of charter schools that siphoned off the small number of talented black kids, the Chicago schools are the junkyard practically all black dominated systems become. In addition, you have many Mexicans in those schools who are almost as bad academically(and behavior wise). </p>
<p>Of course Liberal Ikons Michelle and &#8220;Barak&#8221; sent their cuties to private school at the U of Chicago with their academic pals&rsquo; kiddies where security and learning are a given.  </p>
<p>We need to open vocational schools to parallel at least the high schools. Kids, white or black, who can&rsquo;t cut it in English and Math 9th grade levels at the end of middle school, should be forced to go to vocational school. </p>
<p>Minimal English(i.e. read a magazine and the Internet) should be taught there, as well as a skill. The kid skips the voke school? Imprison them in a juvie until they are 18. </p>
<p>Apply it to all races including the poor English speaking immigrants. This English as a second language nonsense needs to stop; we can&rsquo;t afford it. They learn a trade or go back to Mexico or Dominican Republic, etc.</p>

		<p>I wish the black population would admit they have a problem with academics. Only then will they be able to get to the root of the problem. I went to a high school that was majority black. I can say without hesitation that the teachers at those schools spend much less time teaching. The majority of the time is spent helping kids catch up, stopping fights and dealing with all sorts of behavioral problems. When kids can&rsquo;t do the work they tend to disrupt. I work hard so my kids can go to a private school. I will not leave their education up to our government.</p>

		<p>Wow, yet another article on the &#8220;mysterious&#8221; achievement-gap, complete with all the now-standard platitudinous drivel included to explain away the otherwise painfully obvious! The real achievement here is that these clowns can still get away with this foolishness, right under the noses of supposedly educated and enlightened individuals. Our modern capacity to pretend we don&rsquo;t see what is right before our eyes while we simultaneously  pretend we do see that which does not and cannot exist, rivals any delusional madness from the dark-ages and beyond.   </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s get clear on the Catch 22 of racism claims:</p>
<p>1) blacks are less intelligent because of racism</p>
<p>2) anyone who says the gao is natural (genetic) is a racist - who is then the one causing the IQ gap.</p>
<p>3) this just confirms the racism causes low IQ theory: see? look how racist they are!!</p>
<p>the only solution is that the science of race &amp; IQ has to get out to the public &amp; become undeniable.</p>

		<p>Probably the only way to reduce the general achievement gap between blacks and whites is to continue teaching white children how evil their ancestors were, how good the blacks ancestors were, how everyone is equal, how any that disagree are evil Hitlers etc&hellip;thereby  continuing to get whites to betray their genetic inheritance via miscegenation. With miscegenation the gap will lessen as the genetic gap does. Its simple just change the white race and everyone will be equal.Genetic marxism. Love is all that matters.</p>

		<p>I can think of no problem in human history examined so frequently and at such great expense as the broad disparity in achievement levels of all types between black Africans and whites and Asians.  And the conclusions of such studies, excepting a few reviled examples such as the work of Shockley and Jensen or the The Bell Curve, invariably end in feigned puzzlement, such as &#8220;additional research and funding is needed to get at the root causes,&#8221; or &#8220;more funding is needed for remedial education.&#8221;</p>
<p>What everybody knows, from the most meticulous researcher to the most ignorant layman, is that blacks are, on average, significantly less intelligent that other races, especially Asians and Caucasians.  </p>
<p>Until this dismal fact is acknowledged, black Africans can never find a useful and contributing niche in any society. Should there be barriers to their advancement?  Absolutely not.  Should they be advanced into positions in which they&rsquo;ll fail.  Absolutely not.</p>
<p>A colorblind society doesn&rsquo;t discriminate against anybody at all except on the basis of demonstrated ability. I you can&rsquo;t perform up to required levels, regardless of your race, you have no business being there.  Certainly, even the most ardent champion of black set-asides wouldn&rsquo;t want to fly on an airliner with an all-black cockpit crew, for whom normal flight check standards were waived because of affirmative action.  Yet somehow, positions in which less exacting performance standards are the norm should be fair game for social engineering.</p>
<p>This all leads to endless black frustration, anger, and of course a never-ending sense of entitlement, not exactly a path to success for any racial or ethnic group.</p>

		<p>It still confounds me to think that liberals believe throwing money at this problem is the way to go. Since when does a good education cost a ton of money? Moreover, how does spending more money per student end up teaching that child better?</p>
<p>The answer - it doesn&rsquo;t. How much do you think was spent per student back in the 50s and 60s, yet those people were far better educated (for the most part) than students of today? I&rsquo;m willing to bet the $/student wasn&rsquo;t 1/2-1/3 the average salary like it is in black areas.</p>
<p>Take a look at schools all across the nation; white areas are consistently underfunded when it comes to education, yet they continue to turn out better students with better test scores. Not to mention, the number of students that continue on to college and graduate is much, much higher. </p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into too much detail about where I live, but for the record, this county has an HBCU that is considered to be a &#8220;top&#8221; black school. They are funded nearly TWICE what the state&rsquo;s mostly white universities are, yet have much fewer students. Despite that, the institution is in the paper nearly every week. If the article isn&rsquo;t about continual and widespread corruption amongst staff, it&rsquo;s about them begging for even more taxpayer dollars. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said segregation is the best answer, yet this disproves my point; they&rsquo;re not happy no matter what. When left to their own devices, even with all the money in the world, the end result is failure of epic proportions. </p>

		<p>To John PM:</p>
<p>A great, humorous post, paisan. Your use of science, and the fact that rhinos and hamsters are not equals underscores my own feelings that natural science is the one discipline that seeks out truth, regardless of other considerations. Not all the judicial pronouncements, United Nations resolutions or money can make an okapi the equal of a giraffe.</p>
<p>Putting it another way, all dog breeds are not equal. Would you want a Siberian husky pulling your sled in the Arctic, or a Chihuahua? Why can&rsquo;t human beings come to accept that Australian aborigines, Norse, Chinese and Bantus are equal only in terms that they are mammals, their mothers gave birth to them, and they have hair? They are equal in a scientific sense, in that they are &#8220;created equal&#8221;. They also have the right to live their lives as they see fit. I think this is what Jefferson meant when he penned the words that &#8220;all men are created equal&#8221;, in the preamble to the U.S. Constitution-even as he owned slaves. He was also a man of science.</p>
<p>Have a great one!</p>

		<p>13 Feller: Vocational training is not a dumping ground for dullards.  Learning a trade well takes brainwork, and the degree of responsibility required is much greater than for a lot of degreed administrative jobs.  Where do you want the dumb guy to be working: in the personnel office or the maintenance shop?  Which one is in a position to get someone killed?</p>

		<p>To Schoolteacher:  I understand your point. Be assured &#8220;dullards&#8221; will not make it through a good voke school in a new sane nationalist society. They will be in prison. My prisons will not be garnished with rights and will eliminate the shuffle, the &#8220;teen mom&#8221; and the ipod in the classroom forever. <br>
Teen prisons for losers who don&rsquo;t study voke as a serious subject will be hell on earth, offering a quick exit to the real Hell. </p>
<p>Right now, as you may know, the education school MA&rsquo;s and PHds who run the school system have shut down most voke schools, and gutted practical occupational programs in regular schools. These paper shufflers should join their students in prison for rehabilitation of their souls, as their useless bodies will no longer have much use in a Rational World. </p>
<p>Our &#8220;high&#8221; schools now all pay homage to the fiction that practically all the students will go to college. Ha. A small minority of blacks and latinos do so, and a surprisingly small majority of whites go to &#8220;college&#8221;,most of whom don&rsquo;t graduate college, either community or 4 year. America is the Land of the Lazy and Ignorant. Ruthless elimination of both categories should be in order, for whites and blacks alike.</p>
<p> In fact, we are educating millions of kids whose primarily role should be manual labor. </p>
<p>If sanity returns to the schools, we will have voke schools that will produce true artisans and craftsmen, and academic schools that produced the well educated balanced professionals that  the great 19the century schools of America produced. We also need significantly more military schools of quality for primarily white students.</p>
<p>Get rid of Plyer v Doe, Brown v Board of Education, and the Special Education (give the lazy a vacation) Amendments of 1972 through the present and you have an opportunity of education in America. And get rid of federal aid to education, especially to colleges, except for very specific scientific and military research. Most people do not need college degrees; but education of quality need not be a college degree, especially what passes for &#8220;college&#8221; today. </p>

		<p>Look, I taught for 10 years in the public schools, in minority areas exclusively.  The fact of the matter is, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE between your average white kids and the minorities.  Lower socio-economic Hispanic kids are hampered by lack of discipline at home and lack of interest in education generally; the parents think nothing of taking their kids to Mexico for 6 weeks during the school year, with or without schoolwork for them.  Such kids, already behind, come home further behind than ever.  And &#8220;fiestas&#8221; over the weekend at home take precedence over any meaningful study.  The black kids are more violent than either whites or Hispanics of comparable backgrounds, and they are more sophisticated in sexual knowledge and slang than the others.  They often receive no support at home.  Additionally, in the single parent homes (which is virtually all lower-class blacks), the kids aren&rsquo;t provided with sound nutrition, which hampers the brain development and hence they are less capable intellectually than their white or Hispanic peers.  The brilliant idiots who wrote the laws that decree ALL kids should take the same State tests, regardless or language facility or intellectual ability, have guaranteed failure for these students AND for their teachers.  Yes, teachers are judged by the test performance of these disadvantaged and inept students who occupy seats in their classroom.  The State has provided free lunch and free breakfast for lower income students in an effort to correct the nutritional deficiencies, but it&rsquo;s too late by the time the kids are school-age.  The first 5 years of life is where it counts.  As for the white kids, they generally have better nutrition at home and more interest in education at home than the other two groups, BUT, their parents are more interested in trying to fight against teachers who try to discipline their kids, apparently believing that their kids can do no wrong, so these parents are constantly presenting themselves to the principal to complain and then to the teacher, all the while hoping that the teacher will be reprimanded by the principal for daring to demand that their child behave properly.</p>
<p>Teaching in lower class areas is difficult, frustrating, and not very rewarding, especially since the advent of No Child Left Behind.  That program is worse than stupid; teachers are stuck with scripted lessons written for them by the book publishers, and can exercise no creativity in teaching whatsoever.  I became very ill from stress as a result of all this, and had to resign my position.  I would never recommend anyone going into public education today.  It is a total waste for all concerned.</p>

		<p>&#8220;the only solution is that the science of race &amp; IQ has to get out to the public &amp; become undeniable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The public can read and make up their own minds. Just ignore race &amp; IQ and get on with issues facing the whites. You know, I enjoy reading these articles about IQ when they do occassionally appear just as much as the next red-blooded AmRener, but Good God man! to say helping the white race or contributing to AmRen or whatever depends upon telling everyone whites are smarter than ever other race is just insanity. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see the point of it other than enticing others to want to sleep with us. And that doesn&rsquo;t Seem to be the policy of AmRen. <br>

		<p>&ldquo;A separate report comparing Hispanic and white children is due out next fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would like to see a similar report comparing the sociological behavior of (either wholly or overwhelmingly) Northern Europeans vs. non-Northern Europeans in the US. I would bet that such a report would demonstrate significant cultural and intellectual differences between the groups, on average. </p>
