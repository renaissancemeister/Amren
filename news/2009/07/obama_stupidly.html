<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20090720/US.Harvard.Scholar.Disorderly/">Obama &#8216;Stupidly&rsquo; Comment Disappoints Mass. Cop</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Salsberg, AP, July 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A white police sergeant who arrested renowned black scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. said Thursday he&rsquo;s disappointed President Barack Obama said officers acted &#8220;stupidly,&#8221; despite acknowledging he didn&rsquo;t know all the facts.</p>
<p>Sgt. James Crowley responded to Gates&rsquo; home near Harvard University last week to investigate a report of a burglary and demanded Gates show him identification. Police say Gates at first refused and accused the officer of racism.</p>
<p>Gates was charged with disorderly conduct. The charge was dropped Tuesday, and Gates has since demanded an apology from Crowley.</p>
<p>Obama was asked about the arrest of Gates, who is his friend, at the end of a nationally televised news conference on health care Wednesday night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In radio interviews Thursday morning, Crowley maintained he had done nothing wrong in arresting Gates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I support the president of the United States 110 percent. I think he was way off base wading into a local issue without knowing all the facts as he himself stated before he made that comment,&#8221; Crowley told WBZ-AM. &#8220;I guess a friend of mine would support my position, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Crowley, 42, said he won&rsquo;t apologize. And his union has expressed &#8220;full and unqualified&#8221; support for him.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he told WBZ that Gates verbally assailed him. The police report says Crowley asked Gates to talk outside, to which he responded &#8220;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll speak with your mama outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a lot of yelling, there was references to my mother, something you wouldn&rsquo;t expect from anybody that should be grateful that you&rsquo;re there investigating a report of a crime in progress let alone a Harvard University professor,&#8221; Crowley said Thursday.</p>
<p>Fellow officers, black and white, say he is well-liked and respected on the force. Crowley was a campus police officer at Brandeis University in July 1993 when he administered CPR trying to save the life of former Boston Celtics player Reggie Lewis. Lewis, who was black, collapsed and died during an off-season workout.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police supporters charge that Gates, director of Harvard&rsquo;s W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research, was responsible for his own arrest by overreacting.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Laurel J. Sweet, Marie Szaniszlo, Laura Crimaldi, Jessica Van Sack &amp; Joe Dwinell, Boston Herald, July 23, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Cambridge cop prominent Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. claims is a racist gave a dying Reggie Lewis mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in a desperate bid to save the Celtics superstar&rsquo;s life 16 years ago Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t working on Reggie Lewis the basketball star. I wasn&rsquo;t working on a black man. I was working on another human being,&#8221; Sgt. James Crowley, in an exclusive interview with the Herald, said of the forward&rsquo;s fatal heart attack July 27, 1993, at age 27 during an off-season practice at Brandeis University, where Crowley was a campus police officer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a date Crowley still can recite by rote  &mdash;  and he still recalls the pain he suffered when people back then questioned whether he had done enough to save the black athlete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people were saying &#8216;There&rsquo;s the guy who killed Reggie Lewis&rsquo; afterward. I was broken-hearted. I cried for many nights,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Crowley, 42, said he&rsquo;s not a racist, despite how some have cast his actions in the Gates case. &#8220;Those who know me know I&rsquo;m not,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Lewis&rsquo; widow, Donna Lewis, was floored to learn the embattled father of three on the thin blue line of a national debate on racism in America was the same man so determined to rescue her husband.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though he harbors no &#8220;ill feelings toward the professor,&#8221; a calm, resolute Crowley said no mea culpa will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just have nothing to apologize for,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will never happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Crowley, an 11-year veteran of the force, oversees the evidence room, paid details and records unit. He also coaches youth basketball, baseball and softball.</p>
<p>Joseph McDonald, a former director of public safety at Brandeis, said Crowley was &#8220;a real pro,&#8221; calling Gates&rsquo; racial profiling charge &#8220;strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You just do the job as a cop. You don&rsquo;t look at the color of skin. You&rsquo;re just trying to help people,&#8221; said McDonald, 57.</p>
<p>In a statement expressing its &#8220;full and unqualified support&#8221; for Crowley, the Cambridge Police Superior Officers Association called its brother a &#8220;highly respected veteran supervisor with a distinguished record.</p>
<p>&#8220;His actions at the scene of this matter were consistent with his training, with the informed policies and practices of the department and with applicable legal standards.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Between the Lewis incident and the Gates incident, if Crowley doesn&rsquo;t understand black folks by now, he never will.  They not only don&rsquo;t appreciate the role police officers play in a civil society, they blame them for THEIR own troubles.<br>

		<p>I worked as a police officer in a black area for years.  I can&rsquo;t count the times I would be interviewing a black during an investigation and they would start right off with an attitude of defiance and resistance.  It did not matter how nice or polite you were, they were not going to cooperate with you.  Many of these people were not so called black trash.  I&rsquo;ve had incidents where black professionals, who were teachers and administrators with master degrees, go n===== on me over the smallest thing.  Watching them behave, you would have thought they were ghetto thugs.  I am convinced that this is genetic in blacks and part of their DNA because it seems so prevalent among them.  I never saw white professionals behave this way.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I want to hear from ALL white people, everywhere, starting right now. Enough with the damn apologies already.  Let&rsquo;s all do a Crowley &amp; Not Apologize, ever, for doing the right thing in a difficult situation.  Thank God for this guy.  Seriously.</p>

<p>Effing hilarious.  I read the first reference to Reggie Lewis and was about to make a sarcastic comment about how Crowley had &#8220;killed a black man&#8221;.</p>
<p>This stuff writes itself.</p>
<p>Presumably Crowley held off all the black would-be saviors from delivering CPR to Lewis at gunpoint while he deliberately &#8220;threw the match.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, just, wow!</p>

		<p>Oh, dear. Here we go again.. &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t look at the color of ones skin&hellip;.&#8221;I&rsquo;m not a racist&#8221;&hellip;regarding the Reggie Lewis article. Why do they even have to bring that up? It just shows he is trying to &#8220;prove&#8221; he is not racist! Self-defeating for a White to even try to show he is not. EVERYONE is a racist. Whether they admit it or not. It seems to be okay for blacks etc to show their racism but not us? Until Whites quit trying to prove they are not racists, it will only prolong our misery. I wish for once, a White would say, Yes I am. So are YOU!  So what?</p>

		<p>I tend to think the Lynn Sweet question was prearranged and was the trick card question that would deflect easily from the incompetence of der Leaders&rsquo; healthcare shoutout.<br>
The Racism cry is the fall back position for Obama and the 100% card used by his ChiTown homie, Lynn Sweet and it sets up the enemy of government stealthcare for blame, if the takeover of healthcare fails!<br>
We all know who will be blamed&hellip;white Americans&hellip;the White Police officer vs the Harvard Racist in this equation.</p>

<p>Sgt. James Crowley<br>
Cambridge Police Department<br>
125 Sixth Street<br>
Cambridge, MA 02142</p>
<p>Re:  Gates incident </p>
<p><br>
Dear Sgt. Crowley:</p>
<p>I am writing to express my support for you and your department as it faces unjustified criticism.  </p>
<p>I was of course not present at the incident so I do not know exactly what happened, but the reports in the media reminded me of an incident a few years ago when my house suffered an electrical problem.  I went into the garage to replace a fuse, turning the power back on.  When I did this, the alarm system activated, alerting the police, so I reset the alarm system.  Not more than two minutes later there was a Houston police officer at my front door requesting to see my ID.  I opened the door, showed him my driver license, and thanked him for his fast response.  No incident, just police doing their job, and so therefore no news circus. </p>
<p>I know that there is pressure on you to apologize to Gates.  No doubt someone has suggested that you apologize so that &ldquo;we can just put all this behind us and move forward.&rdquo;   It does not appear to me that you have anything to apologize for, and I commend you for standing firm.  </p>
<p>Some people walk around in our society with a chip on their shoulder, just looking to create an incident so that they can play the victim. I think that Gates is just another one of those people. </p>
<p>Just remember that there are millions of us out here who stand in spirit with you and every other dedicated officer.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br>
William E. Fason<br>

		<p>Has a sitting president ever attacked uniformed police from his position of power before? It seems inappropriate, especially if he is an officer of a state or smaller jurisdiction over which the President has no direct authority. </p>

		<p>President Obama should be apologizing to officer Crowley for racially profiling the White cop as just another bigotted police officer picking on an innocent Black man.  We can only hope that the American people will see the real anti-White, Afro-centrist lurking beneath the celebrity veneer of President Obama as he reveals his true self with this sort of stupid comment.  The President passes judgement on the White cop without having all the facts.  This is the man with his finger on the button, in control of out country.  How in the hell did we get here?</p>

<p>Notice how this whole article is about Crowley trying desperately to prove that he is NOT a racist? The article has him on the defensive throughout the whole piece, trying to prove a negative. Not once is Gates ever required to prove that HE is not a &#8220;racist!&#8221; No, that falls entirely on the white man. </p>
<p>How about Gates? Why does the article contain no speculation on just exactly what HE is??? A race baiter? A provacateur? a racist himself? A madman? </p>
<p>Or how about those thugs who accused Crowley of being a murderer for trying to save a man&rsquo;s life? Why does the article contain no speculation on just what kinds of creatures THEY are? No, only Crowley is questioned or required to justify himself.</p>

<p>When the News Reporter said that Barry did not like how the Sgt. handled this case, the Police Sgt. responded quickly with, &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t vote for him&#8221;, and then smiled.  </p>
<p>Well, there you have it, right from the heart of Liberal Massachusets; A Real White American Male. </p>

		<p>Well, here you have it - another black, educated with white money, (he never would have been admitted to even a JC if he&rsquo;d been white)   &mdash;   who can&rsquo;t WAIT to get into an altercation with the white police so he can get his name out in the public eye.  The fact doesn&rsquo;t seem to register with him.  He just wants publicity.  Ya know, we had a similar case here; a black visiting professor complained to the police that her car had been vandalized with racial slurs written on it.  Well, guess what the morning light revealed!! SHE herself had vandalized the car, and then complained, hoping to get mileage out of the racism charge and publicity for herself.  But she was exposed in all her lying N-word glory, and as far as I know, hasn&rsquo;t been seen here since.  Thanks be to God.</p>

		<p>Claremont White Lady #17: Well, in New York City, a Professor at Columbia University allegedly found a Noose hanging on her office door, and she reported it as a &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221;. </p>
<p>This incident followed the disaster in Jena, Louisiana where Blacks took great exception to a Noose that was hanging from a tree, that White High School Students gathered under, to talk amongst themselves. </p>
<p>I am sure most Am Ren readers know that a White Student, with nothing to do with any of it, was beaten and kicked, almost to death. </p>
<p>This is what lead to the &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; at Columbia University.</p>
<p>After the NYPD investigated the crime, it turned out that the Black Prosfessor placed the Noose on her office door, because she was under review for Plagerism.</p>
<p>The Black Professor lost her job at Columbia, but I am certainly unclear as to whether she was charged with filing a False Police Report, as well as Breach of the Peace.</p>
