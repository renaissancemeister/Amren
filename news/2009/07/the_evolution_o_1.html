<h1><a href="/ar/1995/04.html">The Evolution of Racial Differences in Morality</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Levin, American Renaissance, April 1995</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Readers of <cite>AR</cite> will be aware of the well-documented race differences in intelligence and temperament. The mean black score on valid IQ tests is 85, while the white mean is 100 (and some Asian groups outscore whites). Black children adopted into upper-middle class white families fail to attain IQs much above 85, which implicates genes as the cause of this difference. Twin studies and cross-cultural comparisons implicate genes in the greater levels of impulsiveness and aggression also found in blacks.</p>
<p>A less frequently noted point is that these psychological differences suggest race differences in morality. Part of the difference may be due simply to different levels of intelligence. The mean IQ of incarcerated felons is about 90, and Lawrence Kohlberg&rsquo;s extensive research on children found that IQ is correlated with moral development. It should not be surprising that mental ability is linked to moral character, since the latter requires grasping rules and thinking through the consequences of one&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>However, different levels of intelligence are not likely to be the sole cause of racial differences in morality. Data reported in <cite>The Bell Curve</cite> (and noted in the <a href="/ar/1995/02.html#article2" target="review" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>February issue of <cite>AR</cite></b></a>) show that black and white populations differ in crime and illegitimacy rates even when IQ is held constant. Thus, in one large-scale study, blacks in general were 6.5 times more likely to be incarcerated than whites, but when the comparison was restricted to blacks and whites with IQs of 100, blacks were still 2.5 times more likely to be incarcerated.</p>
<p>Temperament therefore appears to have an effect on behavior that is independent of intelligence. This is intuitively obvious, as aggression easily becomes heedlessness of the rights of others; we should therefore expect black and white standards of behavior to differ.</p>
<p>Examples of this difference abound. &#8220;Trash talk,&#8221; the stream of arrogant banter with which black basketball players seek to intimidate and humiliate opponents, is alien to white ideals of sportsmanship. Likewise, Montel Williams, the host of a television talk show, claimed to have discovered racial bias in a question on an IQ test that asked children what they would do if they threw a baseball through a neighbor&rsquo;s window. The answer scored as correct was offering to pay for the window, but Mr. Williams, who is black, objected that in his old neighborhood a &#8220;Sorry, man&#8221; would have sufficed. No doubt, Mr. Williams was right that blacks do attach less urgency than whites to compensating damage.</p>
<p>Numerous fights among blacks result from &#8220;dissing&#8221;  &mdash;  males seeking dominance over each other by shows of disrespect  &mdash;  a practice that indicates disregard for the golden rule. Moreover, it is hard to imagine a more blatant violation of the golden rule than the constant demand for royalties by Martin Luther King&rsquo;s estate whenever his speeches are published  &mdash;  especially when his own plagiarism is justified as &#8220;voice merging.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>What Morality Is</b></p>
<p>Evolutionary biology suggests an explanation for race differences in moral values. But first, to begin with a definition: An individual&rsquo;s &#8220;morality&#8221; is the <em>rules he wants everyone to follow, and that he wants everyone to want everyone to follow.</em> Honesty is a moral value for him if he tries to be honest, tries to make his children honest, hopes others will be honest, and encourages others to reinforce honesty. A group&rsquo;s morality is the moral rules its members share.</p>
<p>The clause about &#8220;wanting everyone to want everyone&#8221; is needed to distinguish moral questions, like honesty, from other &#8220;universal&#8221; concerns. If you are like most people, you think others ought to be honest. But you may also think everyone should exercise, without considering exercise a &#8220;moral&#8221; value. The difference between the two is not in their usefulness, since both are useful: jogging is healthful, and honesty facilitates such profitable activities as trade. But honesty, unlike exercise, is advantageous <em>only if everyone else is honest.</em> Jogging strengthens my heart whether or not you jog, whereas being honest helps me only insofar as it induces others to reciprocate, allowing me to rely on their words. This is also why it is smart to be honest even when tempted to lie  &mdash;  if you are found out, others will feel no obligation to be honest with you.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if everyone else is a liar, honesty only lets others take advantage of you. Therefore, since honesty, self-restraint, and other moral virtues are good ideas only when everyone thinks they are good ideas, you not only want everyone else to be honest, you want everyone to encourage others to be honest, and to ensure that honesty is widespread.</p>
<p>The advantages of honesty and other virtues have a biological dimension. Since moral individuals in a moral community do better than scoundrels, they live longer and have more children. Obeying and reinforcing moral rules is adaptive. If there is any genetic tendency to obey and reinforce moral rules, a tendency to obey and reinforce them and to be susceptible to reinforcement will be passed on to offspring.</p>
<p>However, selection for morality need not have been uniform, since honesty, cooperation, and the other virtues need not have been equally important in all environments. Cooperativeness (like intelligence) was probably more adaptive in the colder, harsher, Eurasian environment in which whites and Asians evolved than in sub-Saharan Africa. Food grows year-round in a warm climate. There is little danger of freezing to death, so it is not necessary to work together to build large shelters. Sexual patterns are also influenced by environment: Since a woman abandoned by her mate has a better chance of supporting herself and her children in a benign environment, there is less pressure on women to evolve a demand for male fidelity, or for males to evolve a strong sense of attachment.</p>
<p>The situation was otherwise in Eurasia, where large game was a dietary staple. Bringing down a cornered mastodon takes cooperation, with each man in his assigned position, ready to respond to shouted instructions. There must be jointly acceptable rules for dividing the kill. And, since females depend on male hunters for their own survival and that of their children, an advantage would accrue to females who chose mates likely to support them for a lifetime. Sexual selection would then mold males more inclined to satisfy the female demand for fidelity.</p>
<p>Environment does not consist merely of natural factors like climate. Since morality is advantageous only when others are moral, a major determinant of the fitness of an individual&rsquo;s &#8220;gene for morality&#8221; is the character of those with whom he interacts. As Robert Axelrod and William Hamilton put it in their classic study, &#8220;The Evolution of Cooperation&#8221; (<cite>Science</cite> 1981), &#8220;there is no single best strategy regardless of the behavior of others in the population.&#8221; In fact, seemingly irrational levels of mistrust can become locked into a group. Suppose a mild physical environment has selected for weak cooperative tendencies. A worsening of the environment might make greater cooperation in everyone&rsquo;s interest, but not necessarily more fitness-enhancing, for any honest, helpful mutants who appear will simply be exploited until they die without issue. It is perfectly rational to be indifferent to others when they are indifferent to you.</p>
<p>In short, observed race differences in honesty, sexual self-restraint, and cooperativeness may be due to the fact that these traits did not have the same evolutionary value in Africa that they did in Eurasia. Indeed, since universality and reciprocity are built into the very concept of morals, it is incorrect to talk of &#8220;different moralities.&#8221; It is more accurate to say that individuals of Eurasian descent tend to be more moral than individuals of African descent.</p>
<p><b>Consequences</b></p>
<p>Nobody can go back in time to verify whether the races really developed in the way outlined. Still, the hypothesis sketched above is plausible enough, and it may be useful to note some of its implications.</p>
<p>1) Black behavior that is unacceptable by white standards  &mdash;  theft, drug use, preoccupation with sex  &mdash;  is not &#8220;sick.&#8221; It is how traits that were once adaptive in Africa express themselves in Western urban society. This may be part of the reason blacks seem not to experience white laws and standards of personal responsibility as binding, and why black spokesmen are so curiously unapologetic about black crime. They will caution black males that crime is &#8220;stupid&#8221; (i.e. apt to lead to punishment), and a Jesse Jackson may denounce black-on-black crime as harmful to blacks, but they do not say that crime, particularly black-on-white crime, is intrinsically bad.</p>
<p>In one remarkable incident, Edmund Perry, a Harlem teenager recruited on full scholarship to the prestigious boarding school of Exeter, was killed a few weeks after graduation when he attempted to mug a plainclothes policeman. Angry demonstrations ensued, in which blacks complained of Perry&rsquo;s alienation at Exeter. Far from expressing regret over Perry&rsquo;s actions, blacks blamed white society for them. In fact, the difficulties blacks experience in conforming to American society cannot really be blamed on black attitudes <em>or</em> white norms, but on the mismatch between the two.</p>
<p>2) Black children cannot be expected to respond as white children do to externally imposed white socialization. If the races evolved different values, black and white children will be receptive to different sorts of training and exhortation, a point with important practical consequences. It is often suggested, for instance, that black children would do better in school if told, as white and Asian children are, that school is important. But black children will not care about grades and the esteem of teachers, no matter how much they are told to, if valuing knowledge is a more weakly evolved norm among blacks. Since black societies never evolved formal education, it would make no sense for black children to be ready to internalize praise of education.</p>
<p>3) Violence will skyrocket when a group acquires a killing technology it did not develop. Groups that have invented such things as firearms without killing themselves off must also have developed sufficient inhibitions about using them. Groups that acquire weapons from outside sources are less likely to have evolved the same level of self-restraint, just as groups that do not discover fermentation are unlikely to develop a tolerance for alcohol, and often fall prey to drinking problems when alcohol is introduced from outside. Blacks may have been unprepared for access to the firearms developed in Western society.</p>
<p>Consider the remarkable increase in gunshot homicides among black men in the last half-century. In 1943 there were 44 handgun homicides in New York City; in 1992, 1,500 black males died of gunshot wounds inflicted by other black males. Since 92 percent of the 2,200 murders recorded in New York that year were committed by blacks, black males must have also killed several hundred non-blacks with firearms as well. The parallel increase in gunshot homicides nationally over the same period is essentially an increase among blacks.</p>
<p>Now, the sheer availability of guns does not automatically mean murder. Guns have been available for centuries to the whites who invented and manufacture them. Every adult male Swiss citizen owns a gun, yet the annual homicide rate in Switzerland is one two-hundredth that of Washington, D.C. or Harlem. The immediate cause of the rise in homicide has been the sudden availability of guns <em>to blacks,</em> who seem ready to resort to firearms in disputes that whites would regard as trivial. (Gunfights over calls in pick-up basketball games are not uncommon in New York City.) It may well be that blacks lack the restraints that would have evolved during the march to the invention of firearms  &mdash;  a possibility that should be considered in any discussion of gun control. If the &#8220;gun problem&#8221; is really the problem of black access to firearms, forbidding whites to have guns is pointless and unjust.</p>
<p>4) Moral signals may become confused when divergent groups interact. To explain the point with a crude example, suppose that blacks, being less empathetic than whites, must use stronger signals to rouse each others&rsquo; solicitude. It takes angry shouting to get another black to notice an injury that a white can be induced to attend to by less strident means. Likewise, a white will take an angry shout as expressing a more serious injury. If these signal patterns have themselves become innate in the two populations, whites will interpret the signals of blacks as if they were coming from other whites, and consistently <em>overestimate</em> the seriousness of injuries claimed by blacks.</p>
<p>The tendency of whites to interpret the angrier manner of blacks as if blacks were other whites leads whites to respond to black complaints with inappropriate generosity, thereby reinforcing black anger by teaching blacks that anger is rewarded. The result is intensified demands and further white confusion  &mdash;  a dynamic that may explain the puzzling phenomenon of white guilt, and the indulgence of many whites toward even the most unreasonable black demands.</p>
<p><b>Neither Is Better</b></p>
<p>The idea that blacks and whites evolved different systems of values says nothing about which values are &#8220;better,&#8221; and each group can be expected to think its values best.</p>
<p>Whites will continue to consider blacks &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; and blacks will, more openly, continue to call whites &#8220;up tight.&#8221; But the practical decisions of life require the adoption of some standards, and a group can use only those standards evolution has given it.</p>
<p>What by white standards is a black deficiency in morality  &mdash;  defined as conformity to the golden rule  &mdash;  explains the persistent unwillingness of the races to associate with each other. People almost by definition prefer the company of those who share their values, so it is no wonder that whites feel more comfortable with whites. Indeed, while blacks  &mdash;  even including Malcolm X  &mdash;  prefer to send their children to white schools and to use the other amenities of white society, blacks nevertheless prefer the company of blacks. The conventional idea is that these preferences are entirely due to &#8220;prejudice&#8221; that can and should be extirpated by education (i.e. propaganda). But if preference for one&rsquo;s own kind is due to deep-seated differences in values, there seems nothing wrong with it, and there certainly seems no reason for it to be illegal.</p>
<p>Moreover, from their own point of view, whites are <em>right</em> to prefer their own company. By white standards, adherence to the golden rule and norms associated with it are the chief criteria of personal merit. Since blacks are on average less likely than whites to adhere to the golden rule  &mdash;  less cooperative, more aggressive, less respectful of property and persons  &mdash;  the average black is, by white standards, not as good a person as the average white. This is perhaps the least politically correct statement it is possible to make, but it is true and must be made. And, put in non-racial terms, it is one that even liberal egalitarians would assent to. Even they would admit to preferring the company of people who are less apt to steal, kill, lie, cheat, and shout them down in a debate.</p>
<p>It is possible to argue on purely philosophical grounds that people should be able to associate with whomever they please. This right, after all, can be enjoyed by everyone, and is itself in conformity with the golden rule. And this right, which implies that whites can &#8220;discriminate&#8221; in favor of other whites in housing, employment, and the schools to which they send their children, has been contravened by civil rights laws. This was allowed to happen because Americans, who respect freedom but also like to see that freedom is not abused, became convinced by the 1960s that use of the freedom of association to avoid blacks was entirely arbitrary. They became convinced that it could be motivated only by ignorance and hatred, and saw no reason not to forbid actions so maliciously based. Race differences in moral outlook, which people have long sensed, are perfectly good, non-arbitrary reasons for whites to wish to avoid blacks. Perhaps when this is more widely realized whites will once again permit themselves this liberty.<br>

		<p>This article has made me question everything. Is it racist? I don&rsquo;t know; this is something I&rsquo;m really going to think about. Things that I had always assumed were horrible examples of past racism now suddenly make sense to me&hellip; I mean I never thought I would actually be considering these things as a possibility. </p>
<p>The article says:</p>
<p> The idea that blacks and whites evolved different systems of values says nothing about which values are &ldquo;better,&rdquo; and each group can be expected to think its values best.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true&hellip; no race can be said to be better than any other, only different. But this is something I&rsquo;m going to really have to think about. </p>

		<p>When my all-white high school was forcibly integrated, I immediately saw examples of what this author is talking about.</p>
<p>A teacher asks a black student to pass back tests that have been scored. As the black hands an A+ paper back to another black female he blurts out &#8220;You getting mighty WHITE ain&rsquo;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the locker room after P.E. class, a black runs from locker to locker commenting on the genitals of white students, &#8220;da*n,you hung like a mosquito&#8221;, &#8220;oh no whitey don&rsquo;t get no girls wid dat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same black student runs up to a 6&rsquo;5&#8221; white football player, takes a peek and says &#8220;man dat must be where you brain is&#8221; then runs for the cover of several other blacks.</p>
<p>As a result of the busing, the hallways are jammed packed. This does not deter black freshman from shoving and pushing white girls down to rush past them. A white senior grabs one of the punks and asks &#8220;don&rsquo;t you have any respect for women?&#8221; The black student replies with a BLANK, vacant stare.</p>
<p>Lots of other FOND memories. Excellent article, the author is spot-on!</p>

<p>Obviously most non-whites do realize that in most areas &#8220;white&#8221; values are better. This is why they all try to move to white countries. Then they can enjoy favored treatment thanks to the Marxists and can crank their benefit levels higher by screaming &#8216;racism&rsquo;. </p>

<p>Michael Levin is verging on &#8216;historicism&rsquo;. &#8216;Civil rights laws&rsquo; are not preventing discrimination, they are mandating discrimination against whites. I would feel better if Mr Levin would offer his considerable talents to defend &#8216;seperate but equal&rsquo;. Defending the right to favor other whites in housing, employment, and school, is a bit out of place, when the only ones doing that, the only ones who would need to defend &#8216;race realist practices&rsquo;, are non-whites and their &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Perhaps I don&rsquo;t understand Mr Levin clearly. He&rsquo;s a great scientist maybe, but I didn&rsquo;t get what he was trying to say here. </p>

		<p>I find the larger question to be &#8220;how is forced integration going to solve differences in moral evolution????<br>
US and other nations now suffer for trying to apease groups of differing moral values: even to the point where one group excuses murder with guns because it is not their invention.  It is insane to continue the course of integration when moral (social norms) conflict with legitimate laws of a culture.  I favor segration and so do the other races. Geographic distribution of racial groups was better before mass migrations.  V</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think they realize the VALUES  (of white societies) are better   &mdash;    only the BENEFITS.   They don&rsquo;t stop to ponder  why. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the vast majority  of them are perceptive enough, or reflective enough, to recognize the connection of one with the other. </p>
<p>Africans (and such) are not prone to asking deep, probing philosophical questions.   They just see a benefit that&rsquo;s there   &mdash;   as if god-created   &mdash;    and they want it, so they&rsquo;re going to take it, however they can get it, and not wonder about where it came from.</p>

<p>Thats because you&rsquo;ve probably been to a white church, most of those attempt to impart some sort of morality, outside of the most charismatic ones.  So you&rsquo;re making an assumption that black Christian churches are the same.  They are not.</p>
<p>At best, many black churches are screaming rolling around in the pews gawdy Sunday affairs.  At worst, they&rsquo;re fronts for prostitution and drug distribution.  Many of them are well-off financially, even if they don&rsquo;t look it.  Someone I knew back in St. Louis had a multi-unit rental property in north St. Louis, a tiny AME church bounds it to the east.  This church isn&rsquo;t very big, the aforementioned rental property is five times bigger.  However, every Sunday morning, so he tells me, he saw numerous, one after another after another, black women driving up in luxury cars, BMW, Mercs, Caddys, Lexuses, coming to that church.</p>
<p>A confidant of Adam Clayton Powell once bragged that Powell got into the ministry so that he could have all the sex he wanted.</p>

		<p>I was raised in all-white schools for the first 12 grades.  Then I got to college.  Since I was raised Southern, I was shocked and scared when a black woman came and sat down right next to me.  The way I was raised, that wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen, in the mores of both races!  I think that any time a country adopts the morals of the lower classes, that country is on the way out.  This applies to the USA today.  Just look at what passes for music - look at how the younger people treat each other and those older - this is about as degenerate as you can get.  The only kids who appear on the classical radio show as budding concert artists are Jews and Asians.  We need to take back our country - and it starts with morality.  I am not a Protestant Christian, but in this arena they, the Catholics, and the Mormons seem to have the right idea.  So do the more conservative Jews.  For an advanced primarily white society to adopt the morals of the black rapper is simply a travesty.  We have to go back to a more civilized, moral model.</p>

		<p>I have worked with and observed blacks all my life. There is a REAL difference between blacks and Whites (and all other races). I firmly and absolutely believe that. Blacks are simply not like other peoples. Its like they are wired differently. And these same black patterns are universal, seen in country after country all around the world. </p>

		<p>There is no question that different moral values exist for blacks and whites.  The question is whether these differences stem from genetics or upbringing (nature or nurture).  Having spent several years rubbing elbows in a blue-collar environment with African-Americans, I&rsquo;m convinced the differences are due, at least in part, to genetics.  As a previous poster stated, we are simply wired differently.  </p>

That there should be a strong correlation between intelligence and morality is merely common sense. </p>
<p>Not a <i>perfect</i> correlation   &mdash;   there are, of course, simple people with good morals as well as geniuses who are evil   &mdash;   but unquestionably a strong one. Intelligence, as Prof. Levin eloquently and persuasively explains, helps one behave because the intelligent are better able to think through the consequences of their actions. Not just think through as in &#8220;If I commit this behavior am I likely to get caught?&#8221; but also questions like &#8220;If I commit this behavior what effect is it likely to have on those around, and on society as a whole?&#8221;</p>
<p>Excellent article, thanks for reprinting. I especially like this quote:  </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Trash talk,&rdquo; the stream of arrogant banter with which black basketball players seek to intimidate and humiliate opponents, is alien to white ideals of sportsmanship</i></p>
<p>Once in Manhattan I found myself wandering a little <i>too far uptown</i>, unwittingly crossing the invisible border into Harlem. There I witnessed a few minutes of an all-black basketball game on a corner court. The segment of the game I was treated to consisted of one player relentlessly taunting his opponent with endless repetitions of one obscenity and one racial epithet: &#8220;You ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but ****, ******! ******, you ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but ****! You ain&rsquo;t ****! You ain&rsquo;t ****, ******!&#8221; </p>
<p>And so on (and on and on), with only the slightest of variations, for all the time it took to round that corner on foot. I was impressed that the recipient of all this trash talk was able to keep his cool; I expected a fight to break out but it didn&rsquo;t. (Well, not while I was watching, anyhow. Later, who knows?) </p>
<p>But it was &#8220;alien to white ideals of sportsmanship,&#8221; that&rsquo;s for sure! </p>

		<p>The following by Mr. Levin is the most insightful and encompassing explanation for the current state of race relations that has ever been written.  I wish every puzzled, beleagered, and perplexed white person were required to memorize it:</p>
<p><br>
<i>4) Moral signals may become confused when divergent groups interact. To explain the point with a crude example, suppose that blacks, being less empathetic than whites, must use stronger signals to rouse each others&rsquo; solicitude. It takes angry shouting to get another black to notice an injury that a white can be induced to attend to by less strident means. Likewise, a white will take an angry shout as expressing a more serious injury. If these signal patterns have themselves become innate in the two populations, whites will interpret the signals of blacks as if they were coming from other whites, and consistently overestimate the seriousness of injuries claimed by blacks&hellip;The tendency of whites to interpret the angrier manner of blacks as if blacks were other whites leads whites to respond to black complaints with inappropriate generosity, thereby reinforcing black anger by teaching blacks that anger is rewarded. The result is intensified demands and further white confusion &mdash; a dynamic that may explain the puzzling phenomenon of white guilt, and the indulgence of many whites toward even the most unreasonable black demands.</i></p>

		<p>An article written in 1995; yet, it&rsquo;s more timely than ever, in my opinion. Michael Levin hit the nail on the head by saying it&rsquo;s pointless to deprive whites from gun ownership because of the crimes blacks commit with guns. Yet, this is what liberals propose to solve problems of, and created by, other people.</p>

		<p>My observations over the years show me that blacks for the most part are very materialistic, even to the point of black women overlooking their spouses girlfriends (almost every married black guy I&rsquo;ve known has a girl on the side)as long as their husband brings home the &#8220;bacon&#8221;. I see that blacks are stuck near the bottom of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs, most never reaching for the self-actualization level. I&rsquo;ve seen society, via the media and marketers/profiteers decay in a direction of the lowest common denominator. Yes, black culture is being advanced as &#8220;cool&#8221; and something to strive for. Namely sex, bling, a big Escalade with gaudy rims (toy examples of which I&rsquo;ve seen for sale in Wal-mart, complete with the big pimpin&rsquo; rims)loud and rude public behavior, young girls clothes looking like hooker-wear, nasty dry-humping like booty dancing and the whole &#8220;pimp and ho&#8221; culture. Is that what White Americans should aspire to? It&rsquo;s a disgrace and the diversity dingbats and melting pot magpies won&rsquo;t be satisfied until all that was good in America is relegated to third world status. <br>

		<p>Off-guard comment from my (normally) very P.C. sister-in-law:</p>
<p>&#8220;They go to church and then they go out and attack people.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lives in Bermuda which is 60% black, has one of the highest GDPs in the world on a per capita basis and also one of the highest prison populations.</p>
<p>Bermuda is regarded by many as a paradise but blacks are exhibiting the same pathologies as they do everywhere else. AR should do a feature on it.</p>

		<p>THere is a theory that some members of the human race actually were aliens from another planet, solar system, galaxy who visited earth millenia ago. Maybe Ezechiel&rsquo;s wheels were actually space craft. <br>
I&rsquo;m beginning to believe that Africans were the only race to evolve here on earth and that Caucasians and perhaps Asians are the descendents of the others. The basic humanoid anatomy would be the most ideal to survive on an air planet therefore we all have are fundamentally the same. But the similarity ends there. </p>

		<p>Forced integration has accomplished one thing: it has succeeded in lowering whites&rsquo; behavior and morality to be more in line with blacks&rsquo;. Since it is unacceptable to BLATANTLY enforce two different standards of behavior, whites have been getting away with acting black, emulating &#8216;cool, anti-establishment rebelliousness. Young whites have become less responsible, less polite, less empathetic, trashier looking, lazier, more self-centered, more demanding and more violent. </p>

		<p>Dealing with blacks is a lose-lose proposition 95% of the time. While I couldn&rsquo;t avoid them altogether in school, I&rsquo;ve made every effort to after being beholden to the governmental demands for diversity. The number of minorities in the local elementary school can be counted on both hands. </p>
<p>Speaking of &#8220;bling&#8221;, a few years ago, a friend was recalled to active duty after 9/11 to work in a security unit. One of the things he quickly noticed was that a number of the &#8220;brothers&#8221; were engaged in a contest of who has the most pimped out SUV. From what he overheard, a couple of the guys served in tax free locations before transferring back to the states and paid cash for the initial purchase. The rims and all the other stuff came later. However the bulk of these clowns had car payments that ate up an ungodly amount of their paychecks. He suspected that many were involved in nefarious activities off-base. (Primarily things like dogfighting.) While he couldn&rsquo;t avoid being stuck on patrol or guard duty with some of these knuckleheads, he was fortunate enough not to have one of these guys as a barracks roommate (and subsequently seen all of his stuff disappear). </p>
<p>Dr. Walter Williams writes that he grew up in the Richard Allen projects in North Philadelphia back in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s. While I&rsquo;m sure that things were pretty rough back then, however, he states that residents didn&rsquo;t live in utter fear of all of the other residents. Grocery and furniture stores would deliver goods and even the debit insurance man could walk around without being robbed, even though everyone knew he had money on him. Back then, they could screen tenants without fear of being sued and segregation meant that the intelligent blacks could enforce some discipline on the community. There were still traces of this as late as the early 1970&rsquo;s, but poor blacks aspiring to get ahead and something other than sports or entertainment is unheard of today. The one thing that I have never seen Dr. Williams address is the intelligence factor. If this man doesn&rsquo;t have a genius level IQ, he is darn close. Unlike most of his peers, he made it on merit. It must be incredibly difficult for him to comprehend the sheer level of irresponsibility that occurs in the black community. </p>
