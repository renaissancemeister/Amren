<h1><a href="https://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/670484">Police Condemned for Profiling of Letter Carrier</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Eglinton, Toronto Star, July 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ron Phipps admits he was criss-crossing Vernham Ave. the day he was stopped by police in the Bridle Path.</p>
<p>He was also wearing a Canada Post coat and carrying two mailbags while filling in for the regular letter carrier.</p>
<p>Toronto Police Const. Michael Shaw pointed that out to a new constable he was training as soon as they turned into the street. Shaw was also suspicious about Phipps, who is black, speaking to a homeowner but not delivering her any mail.</p>
<p>They also had instructions to investigate cut phone lines and look for suspects described as male, white and eastern European who were seen in a car.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario has ruled that by stopping Phipps on March 9, 2005, questioning him, trailing him and asking a white letter carrier to verify his identity, Shaw was guilty of racial profiling.</p>
<p>The fact that Phipps &#8220;was an African-Canadian in an affluent neighbourhood was a factor, a significant factor, and probably the predominant factor, whether consciously or unconsciously, in Const. Shaw&rsquo;s actions,&#8221; adjudicator Kaye Joachim wrote in her decision last month.</p>
<p>At the hearing, Shaw contended each of Phipps&rsquo; actions was suspicious, despite his uniform.</p>
<p>Joachim batted each one down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Letter carriers take vacation, retire and/or switch routes&#8221; so seeing a man with a mailbag he didn&rsquo;t know doesn&rsquo;t explain Shaw&rsquo;s suspicions, Joachim wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not accept Const. Shaw&rsquo;s evidence that the applicant was crossing the street back and forth in an unusual fashion. Const. Shaw was well aware that letter carriers do not stop at every house. It was not unusual to misdeliver mail and to go back and try to retrieve it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that it was an African-Canadian male without a vehicle that attracted Const. Shaw&rsquo;s attention is what is unusual,&#8221; wrote Joachim.</p>
<p>The ruling is just the first half of the case that started that chilly morning in March 2005.</p>
<p>The tribunal on Sept. 14 will hear the same accusations against the Toronto Police Services Board and Chief Bill Blair.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was always broader than Const. Shaw,&#8221; Phipps said yesterday from his Thornhill residence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know there is more than one Const. Shaw in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>This case is important, said law professor David Tanovich, because it is the second clear Ontario human rights tribunal ruling of racial profiling against police.</p>
<p>The first was against Peel Regional Police in 2007. Tanovich is academic director of the Law Enforcement Accountability Project at the University of Windsor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most cases are not about overt racism. They&rsquo;re about stereotyping. I think the Bridle Path contributed. One of the assumptions is that this person is out of place,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more positive findings we get, the greater focus on training and proper directives. Very few of these cases ever make their way to court.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the incident, Phipps said he has trouble sleeping and has lost weight, affecting his other job as a personal trainer. Medication to help him sleep has damaged his eyesight. He is &#8220;teased mercilessly&#8221; by co-workers, and his wife and parents fear repercussions from the police.</p>
<p>Phipps, 44, is asking for a financial award in the case; he won&rsquo;t say how much. He also wants the police to pair officers with partners &#8220;of a different race or culture&#8221; to teach them to &#8220;cope with difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaw is on &#8220;prolonged leave&#8221; from 33 Division, police said yesterday.</p>
<p>Phipps immigrated to Toronto from Jamaica as a child with his parents and seven brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no idea what racism was until I came to Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1975, he was with a group of friends between 10 and 14 years old who stopped a police officer to ask directions, he said. Their response: &#8220;Do you pickaninnies think this is a cab?&#8221;</p>
<p>His own son is now 14. &#8220;I would like to be able to say, &#8216;If you have trouble, you can turn to a police officer.&rsquo; But I can&rsquo;t say that.&#8221;<br>

		<p>All they did was talk to him.  No arrest, no detention, no physical touching. Now he isn&rsquo;t sleeping well, has lost weight, and has difficulty in other areas of his life.</p>
<p>Canada Post has a notorious reputation for giving preferential hiring to non-whites, whom they (erroneously) call &#8216;visible minority&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In their haste to hire a rainbow workforce, they got what they deserved.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Bridle Path&#8221; is a street on which multi-million dollar homes are located and considering that Toronto   &mdash;  like any other large city in White western nations   &mdash;   has a crime rates disproportionately attributed to Blacks, especially those immigrants who hail from Jamaica as did this &#8220;African-Canadian&#8221;. Police Constable Shaw had good reason to question <b>Jamaican immigrant</b> Phipps. </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This was always broader than Const. Shaw,&rdquo; Phipps said yesterday from his Thornhill residence. I know there is more than one [Police] Const. Shaw in the world.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The &#8220;broader&#8221; issue Phipps is referring to, is the possibility of extracting ca$h from Canadian taxpayers to help alleviate some of his hurt feelings while he publicly smears a police officer&rsquo;s good name.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>He also wants the police to pair officers with partners &#8216;of a different race or culture&rsquo; to teach them to &#8216;cope with difference.&rsquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This Jamaican immigrant feels so encouraged with his false vindication at the hands of a kangaroo court, now thinks he&rsquo;s qualified to dictate policy in how a major police force should operate. </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I had no idea what racism was until I came to Canada.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve heard the old expression, &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t stand the heat in the kitchen&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..&#8221;</p>

		<p>Jamaicans belong in Jamaica, not Canada. </p>
<p>This silly case is another reason those Human Rights Tribunals have got to get tossed out permanently. Can you imagine if every time somebody felt slighted by the police like this guy claims, if they had to have a hearing on it&hellip;&hellip;. the entire system would grind to a halt with all this frivolous nonsense.</p>

		<p>This is what White nations get when they pass laws that are detrimental to Whites and favor minorities. It is practically illegal in our countries NOT to hire these minorities who are quickly becoming majorities. That yellow stripe down our backs is going to be our downfall in the end.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not profiling. It&rsquo;s discrimination. Here in the states, there are no white youths age 16 to 21, who are hired to deliver the mail. Had these police officers only been aware that the post office discriminates against white youths and white men, not hiring them at this age, theses police officers might not have been suspicous or confused. Police should know, diversity is everywhere. </p>

		<p>&#8220;coping with the differences?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;coping with the differences&#8221; simply means mind your own damn business Whitey and suffer the consequences of our actions. &#8220;coping with the differences&#8221; simply means reap the wind that your masters blew and just except your fate as you know it to be. &#8220;coping with the differences&#8221; simply means turn the other way and do not ever think about defending yourself as we the non-whites rape, kill, torture, mutilate, kidnap, and abuse you and your &#8220;White&#8221; family&rsquo;s and people. &#8220;Profiling&#8221; is an action charged because, the non-white who was &#8220;profiled&#8221; in the process of the crime was not able to fulfill that crime which most likely would of been a &#8220;White&#8221; casualty, thus taking more from the gene pool of our folk. </p>
<p>It is proven fact that &#8220;profiling&#8221; is the only thing that works and saves lives, and we all know that anything that saves lives and works for &#8220;Whitey&#8221; is evil and cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>Something surely has to give sooner or later, because our people cannot for much longer except and tolerate being treated like this in are own lands, or else either their will be bloodshed or our people will just die out. What really gets me is these people coming here and dictating to us when, where, what, and how to be what they want us to be. This is our land and how dare these people talk down to &#8220;Whitey&#8221; and assault us!!! If they do not like it they know where the door is and to not let it hit their but on the way out.  </p>

		<p>This is so obviously reeks of a person that is trying to get something for nothing. If a white person had of gone through the exact same thing nothing would of come of it. Constable Shaw has apparently been on the force for over 36 years I am guessing that he is more than aware of his duties and responsibilities to the public. So what should the cops do? Turn a blind eye to possible crimes of any sort because the person is a minority?? Wouldnt that be a great thing. Maybe if Mr. Phipps thinks he is being treated so unfairly here in Canada maybe he should take the next plane back to Jamaica. Since he seems to think he is an expert on how a police force should be run he could advise Jamaica on how to do it seeing asthough it isnt safe to travel the island without threat of being robbed or killed. But then again if he did go back to Jamaica he wouldnt be able to abuse our system. Mr. Phipps &hellip;I persoally would be delighted to pay for a one way ticket for you. People like you&hellip;white, black, orange or purple&hellip;we dont need you here.</p>

Aside from the absurdity of all this, note all of the parties involved, The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, the courts and the usual academic. All paid for, no doubt, by the Canadian taxpayer, to engage in &#8216;hand-wringing&rsquo; because a &#8216;person of colour&rsquo; has had his feelings hurt! As a poster above pointed out, the policeman didn&rsquo;t even touch him.<br>
Meanwhile, the policeman is on prolonged leave for attempting to do his job.<br>
I hope we get an update on Mr Sooky&rsquo;s compo claim here, because he will get one.</p>

		<p>On another point, it is distressing to see that horrible PC term &#8216;letter-carrier&rsquo; (a silly, meaningless euphemism), being used in lieu of the good old fashioned ancient job description &#8216;postman&rsquo; which not only is a better word in itself, but conferrs a degree of dignity to the job description.<br>
   One must note that the horrible PC euphemism was brought in to appease militant feminists as &#8216;postman&rsquo; was (ridiculously) deemed &#8216;sexist&rsquo;.<br>
 We also have another silly word, namely &#8216;fire-fighter&rsquo; put for &#8216;fireman&rsquo; gaining currency due to sustained pressure from Orwellian thought police.</p>

<p>Oh, the horrors!  I (a white man) was once &#8220;profiled&#8221; as a suspect in an armed robbery nearby where I was taking a walk.  The police held me until they had the victim driven by in a police cruiser to take a look at me.  Obviously, I wasn&rsquo;t the one, so they let me go.  No trouble sleeping, no weight loss (or gain), no nothing except a little indignation that the cops took this robbery more seriously than when I had been mugged in the same area a few months before.  Even the mugging didn&rsquo;t produce the stress this crybaby is whining about.</p>

<p>Who asked him to come to Canada? And he&rsquo;s always free to go right back to Jamaica where he came from. He won&rsquo;t though, of course. He&rsquo;s not that stupid. Like all non-White foreigners here, he&rsquo;s smart enough to know a good thing when he milks, er, sees it. As for poor, put-upon Canadians, we had no idea what blacks were really like until they started coming here. </p>

		<p>When myself and my mates were in our late teens, we used to go out to see a lot of bands; because we were walking in a group of about five, or maybe more, we were stopped on quite a few occaisions by the police. They&rsquo;d ask, &#8216;what are you lot doing tonight?&rsquo;, we&rsquo;d tell them and they&rsquo;d ask us for identification.<br>
Anyway, even back then I thought, maybe some nasty incident or some vandalism occured in the neighbourhood and they were driving around looking for the likely lads (which certainly wasn&rsquo;t us!).<br>
No big deal eh?</p>
<p>One more, if ye will indulge:<br>
Back in the late 80s a friend of mine was on a camping trip, a horrific child murder occured in the same area and the suspects by an amazing coincidence happened to have a very similar car to this fellow, my mate had no idea that this had occured.<br>
Anyway, the police roll up to where he was camping, take him away for questioning and the poor bugger had no idea what they were talking about! He was detained and when the police realised that it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be him, they told him what the deal was, apologised and off he went.<br>
He said it was a rather scary ordeal, but when the coppers explained he said, &#8220;fair enough.&#8221;<br>
If he wasn&rsquo;t white&hellip;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I had no idea what racism was until I came to Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a simple solution to that problem, isn&rsquo;t there&hellip;</p>
<p>Yet again, non-whites FORCE themselves onto whites, then complain when those whites have the audacity to believe their own eyes, and not what the insane liars in the media tell us every day.</p>
<p>Who voted for this ridiculous kangaroo court and the &#8216;laws&rsquo; that enable it? Certainly not the white majority who BUILT Canada.</p>

		<p>Back in the Seventies, I was &#8220;profiled&#8221; by the Toronto police because I had a beard, and they were searching for a murderer who had been described as having a beard (as it turned out, he didn&rsquo;t).  Where, O where, was the &#8220;Human Rights Commisssion&#8221; then?  Oh, silly me!  I&rsquo;m White, so it didn&rsquo;t count!<br>
