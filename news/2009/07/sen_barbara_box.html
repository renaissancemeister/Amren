			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anne Schroeder Mullins, Politico, July 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While most people were paying attention to Day 4 of Sonia Sotomayor&rsquo;s Senate confirmation hearings, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) was grabbing the attention of all those watching the Environment and Public Works hearing this morning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boxer was speaking to panelist Harry C. Alford, the president &amp; CEO of the National Black Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boxer then quoted a NAACP resolution that passed and put it in the record.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alford: &#8220;What does that mean, though? The NAACP has a resolution, what does that mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Boxer: &#8220;Sir, they could say the same thing about what do you mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alford: &#8220;I&rsquo;ve got documentation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boxer: &#8220;Sir, they passed it. They passed it. Now, also, if that isn&rsquo;t interesting you to we&rsquo;ll quote John Grant, who is the CEO of 100 Black Men of Atlanta.&#8221; [She goes on to read quote.]</p>
<p>Alford: &#8220;Madam Chair, that is condescending to me. I&rsquo;m the National Black Chamber of Commerce and you&rsquo;re trying to put up some other black group to pit against me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boxer: &#8220;If this gentlemen were here he would be proud that he was being quoted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alford: &#8220;He should have been invited!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boxer: &#8221; &hellip; he&rsquo;s proud, I&rsquo;m sure, that I am quoting him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alford: &#8220;All that&rsquo;s condescending, and I don&rsquo;t like it. It&rsquo;s racial. I don&rsquo;t like it. I take offense to it. As an African-American and a veteran of this country, I take offense to that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Boxer: &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. offense at the fact that I would quote  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alford: &#8220;You&rsquo;re quoting some other black man. Why don&rsquo;t you quote some other Asian .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are being racial here. And I think you&rsquo;re getting to a path here that&rsquo;s going to explode.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boxer reviews what she had been doing and then mentions that &#8220;there is definitely differing opinions in the black community. Just as there are in my community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alford: &#8220;You&rsquo;re speaking on behalf of the black community?&#8221;</p>
<p>Boxer: &#8220;No. I am putting in the record a statement by the NAACP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alford: &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Boxer: &#8220;Because I think it is quite relevant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alford: &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why are you doing the Colored People Association study with the Black Chamber of Commerce?&#8221;</p>
<p>Boxer: &#8220;I am trying to show the diversity of support that we have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alford: &#8220;Diversity?&#8221;</p>
<p>Boxer: &#8220;And I will go ahead and do one more diversity of support .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually Alford declares, &#8220;We are referring to the experts regardless of their color. And for someone to tell me, an African-American, college-educated veteran of the United States Army that I must contend with some other black group and put aside everything else in here  &mdash;  this has nothing to do with the NAACP and really has nothing to do with the National Black Chamber of Commerce. We&rsquo;re talking energy and that road the chair went down, I think, is god-awful.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Everybody&rsquo;s missing the point.  All &#8220;cap and tax&#8221; will do is to raise the cost of the utility bills that many blacks never pay anyway.  As a matter of fact, the NAACP supports it because &#8220;cap and tax&#8221; will very likely have more funding for &#8220;utility assistance.&#8221;  In other words, your energy bill is going to triple, but not theirs.</p>

		<p>Senator Barbara Boxer, has presided over the downfall of California, since she was elected 16 years ago. In fact, race politics is a speciality of hers. She has never supported citizens over illegal aliens. She loves to play these games of pitting one group over another, even if they are two factions of the same group. When will Americans perceive the true face of some of these people they have elected?</p>

		<p>This rude dimwit had the gall to tell a White US Army General not to call her madam, but she suddenly lost her courage and gall when confronting this gentelman, I wonder why? I am sure that she is the type person who raised her kid&rsquo;s and grandkid&rsquo;s to address uniformed Police Officer&rsquo;s in public as Mack, Chief, Johnny, or Pal, then respond when corrected on this rude form of behavior &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know your name, what am I supposed to call you&#8221; They then think they are so smart.

		<p> I love it. I think Amren should get a collection of these episodes together where liberals get beat down [verbally and physically] and sell them as a way to raise funds. I would certainly buy several. They&rsquo;d be great stocking stuffers. You could gather the family together and watch it like we all watch &#8216;It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life&rsquo;, make it a family tradition. Call it &#8216;It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Liberal Beat Down&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>This is rich, the president of the National BLACK Chamber of Commerce accusing this clueless white liberal of playing the race card.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s racial. I don&rsquo;t like it. I take offense to it. As an African-American and a veteran of this country, I take offense to that!&#8221;  LOL!!  The words &#8220;hoist&#8221; and &#8220;petard&#8221; come to mind.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re both idiots.</p>
<p>Alford looked like he was anticipating a moment to jump out of his seat to accuse Boxer of racism, and Boxer goes so far out of her way to not be called racist that she just ends up sounding racist. LOL, gotta love it! Liberal minority pandering at it&rsquo;s finest, yet she came off as a condescending bi, errr&hellip;birch tree. </p>
<p>Alford was most correct, though, I have to side with him on this. But Mr. Alford, for being so &#8220;highly educated&#8221;, you should know that the word is &#8220;condescending&#8221;, not &#8220;condenscending&#8221;. You aren&rsquo;t Jesse Jackson to make up big words out of thin air. Sorry.</p>

		<p>He says he&rsquo;s a college graduate? Really? I thought he was a derelict who evaded security and stumbled into a Lewis <br>
Carroll(I mean Barbara Boxer) typical hearing. </p>
<p>Also, I love how the idea that blacks can have diverse views is verboten to this mental defective even though white and black educators and officials babble about &#8220;diversity&#8221; all the time.<br>
Of course diversity never includes European or American white culture.</p>

		<p>So, basically Barbara Boxer is saying something is more important when a black man says it, and this black guy is upset! Very angry.</p>
<p>What, is he upset because this is dehumanizing to whites? I&rsquo;d be surprised, I&rsquo;m willing to bet he&rsquo;s filled with righteous anger because this too upsets his delicate blackness. At least his delicate black sensibilities. </p>

		<p>Wonder how she likes having to deal with a racially aggressive black man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure she thought she was immune to such attacks. I&rsquo;m sure she thought she&rsquo;d never have to worry, and in her multicultural utopia only the &#8216;racists&rsquo; would have to worry about that.</p>

		<p>How do race and energy conversation relate to each other?</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics tend not to be the most efficient people in the world when it comes to energy.  I have had a landlord who rents to blacks in St. Louis City tell me that in the winter, many of them turn their thermostats up to 80 or higher, such that they run just about all the time.  Then they whine about how they can&rsquo;t pay the high natural gas bill, so they ask for government help or church assistance programs.</p>
<p>And their wasteful ways don&rsquo;t just affect themselves   &mdash;   everybody pays higher rates because the natural gas company has to buy more natural gas on the open market because many of their black customers are using it irresponsibly.  It most hurts elderly people on fixed incomes.  There was a plan out of California a few years ago to give governments radio control over an individual&rsquo;s thermostat, mainly for environmental reasons.  I think race is the white elephant in the room.  Should natural gas get much higher, I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily oppose them doing this. </p>

		<p>Sadly, most posters here miss the point. This man&rsquo;s argument is about a specific policy. Any counter argument should be presented providing data to back up the Senator&rsquo;s position. Instead, Senator Boxer, like all liberal collectivists, tells him to be a good black man and agree with her. After all, such masters of science as the NAACP are on board. Boxer would never have dared to argue her point using identity politics with a white or asian man. Harry C. Alford knows this. He was expecting to be treated like a man. </p>

<p>I saw the video. Any White man, who interrupted Sen. Boxer as rudely  as African Alford did, would have been told that he was manifesting contempt for Congress. If he repeated his actions, he would have been arrested and charged accordingly. </p>

<p>Identity politics are the reason why Alford was testifying in the first place, regardless of the merits of his arguments he was there representing the National BLACK Chamber of Commerce.  A white or asian man wouldn&rsquo;t be there representing the WHITE Chamber of Commerce or ASIAN Chamber of Commerce.  Again, hoist/petard.  They&rsquo;re both idiots.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with the black on this one.  There&rsquo;s no question she was rubbing his head and soothingly telling him how much her side benefits blacks, instead of getting his opinion as an individual regarding the subject matter.  This is typical mentally challenged liberals unaware of their abysmal shortcomings.</p>
<p>Boxer is an East Coast radical who engages in whisper campaigns about how awful Southerners are, even before she knew any.  She also despises Anglo-Americans.</p>
<p>When she insisted prior to this that the military officer call her senator instead of maam, she revealed another of her pet hatreds.  Her kind despises early white accomplishment, espcially in the West, and the word &#8220;maam&#8221; reminds her of the common use of the word by rural white folks, and she hates them.  Her ilk believes this country never climbed out of the abyss of ignorance until those like her inundated our cities.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s mediocre at best, and she does so want to regard herself as part of the intelligentsia, as do others in her league who are beset with delusions.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the black guy in the video called her &#8220;maam&#8221; a couple of times.  I wonder why she never admonished him?<br>
(As if I didn&rsquo;t know.)  </p>
