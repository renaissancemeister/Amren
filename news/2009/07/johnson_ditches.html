			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Walters, Daily Mail (London), July 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Home Secretary Alan Johnson is to scrap his predecessor&rsquo;s policy of naming and shaming people banned from Britain for spreading race hate and terrorism.</p>
<p>The U-turn follows Jacqui Smith&rsquo;s controversial decision two months ago to announce a list of 16 people branded as &#8216;least wanted&rsquo; in the UK.</p>
<p>It led to a claim for £100,000 damages by U.S. radio &#8216;shock jock&rsquo; Michael Savage, who objected to being put in the same category as Islamic hate preachers and terrorists.</p>
<p>The Mail on Sunday has been told that Mr Johnson believes the move was a blunder and does not propose to issue similar lists in the future. But the switch could have major legal consequences for the Government.</p>
<p>Mr Savage is suing Ms Smith for libel over the list and abandoning the policy could make it impossible to contest his demand for damages.</p>
<p>The presenter, real name Michael Weiner, has eight million listeners for his Savage Nation show in America, but his hardline views on Islam, rape and autism have caused outrage.</p>
<p>He said Ms Smith had no right to put him on the same list as a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, a skinhead gang leader and a Hezbollah militant.</p>
<p>The ban sparked a major debate about freedom of speech  &mdash;  Mr Savage claimed he was forced to employ security guards after threats against him.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I&rsquo;m not a terrorist. I&rsquo;m one of America&rsquo;s most popular radio hosts and a happily married father of two.</p>
<p>&#8216;Maybe Jacqui Smith just plucked my name out of the hat because I&rsquo;m controversial and white  &mdash;  to counter-balance all the Arabs named on her list.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The initiative was seen at a time as an attempt by Ms Smith to save her job after her expenses controversy.</p>
<p>She said then: &#8216;It&rsquo;s important that people understand the sorts of values and sorts of standards that we have here, the fact that it&rsquo;s a privilege to come here, and the sort of things that mean you won&rsquo;t be welcome in this country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the list, denounced as a gimmick by the Tories, quickly unravelled after officials admitted not all the fanatics had actually intended to travel to the UK.</p>
<p>They had been placed on a list of people accused of &#8216;unacceptable behaviour&rsquo;  &mdash;  simply on the off-chance they may decide to visit.</p>
<p>Two on the list, Russian teenage skinheads Artur Ryno and Pavel Skachevsky, were serving ten years in a Russian jail.</p>
<p>Others on the list included a Hamas MP, Islamic activists, a Kashmiri terror group leader and an American Baptist pastor.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Michael Savage may be allowed to go to Britain after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what?  He&rsquo;s a mis-leader, a distractor, and a red herring to draw attention AWAY from the REAL issues. Britain is actually better off without him. They have enough distractions and deceptions to cope with already. He will only further cloud the atmosphere.  The Brits don&rsquo;t need him any more than we do.</p>

I don&rsquo;t see Geert Wilders&rsquo; name mentioned anywhere here as having been &#8220;pardoned&#8221; like Savage (not that either Wilders OR Savage has ever done anything to the British govt that they NEED to be &#8220;pardoned&#8221; for!).</p>
<p>So, Mr. Johnson, does that mean Geert Wilders is still banned from Britain or not?</p>
<p>And what if Mr. Wilders should some day become the leader of the Netherlands   &mdash;   will you let him in then?</p>
<p>For diplomatic functions, at least?</p>

		<p>So, does this mean the Government is actually rescinding its policy of banning certain persons from entering the UK - or is it simply rethinking the idea of making the names public?</p>
<p>I have no problem with banning true extremists, e.g., Muslim fanatics, who have no business coming to the UK anyway. What I do have a problem with is the list being used to exclude &#8220;racists&#8221;   &mdash;   persons whose only defect is probably that of being BNP supporters/sympathisers, i.e., the very kinds of persons who want to see Britain preserved as a free, prosperous white nation.</p>
<p>Until such time as the current Communist regime and its Lib/Con allies is removed from power, the existing policy is likely to be used to exclude the very persons who need to be allowed in.</p>

		<p>Savage may be correct about his name, along w/that of two Russian skinheads serving ten-year sentences, being added to that list because they needed token whites to balance with the muslims.  </p>
<p>Now that the Brits have dropped the list, how about also dropping their Orwellian &#8220;hate speech&#8221; laws?</p>

<p>Mr Savage believes that Autism is overdiagnosed in many communities in order to enable lower income families to get more welfare. I don&rsquo;t share his view on this. He also thinks that, to an extent its a woman&rsquo;s fault if she gets raped. He has rather disturbing thoughts I suppose, but banning someone makes people take notice of the person. If the Government had let him in, he&rsquo;d be in some convention centre with a few people and that would&rsquo;ve been the end of it.</p>

		<p>Anyone who wants to gauge Alan Johnson&rsquo;s credentials as an English patriot may be referred confidently to the BNP web site.</p>
<p>I would suspect that this hard leftist merely wants to make it easier for even more Muslim fanatics to come over and spread their poison.</p>

		<p>Muslims rally in the streets (thousands) and chant &#8220;death to America and death to Britain&#8221;, and no response from the Home Secretary.  </p>
<p>The real problem is a  problem of cowardice by white men in charge (and women), constantly attempting to cater to some dissident.</p>
<p>In America we have stooped and bowed enough to each and every low IQ, no value punk and culture and it has ruined our country.</p>
<p>Since 1965 we have degenerated and will continue to do so - savage isn&rsquo;t the problem.</p>

		<p>Michael Savage lies.</p>
<p>Example #1</p>
<p>He said no Republican Candidate for President would come on and &#8216;face the Savage Nation&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is a LIE! Ron Paul wanted the chance to address the Savage Nation, but Savage wouldn&rsquo;t let him on.</p>
<p>Example #2</p>
<p>Michael Savage said &#8216;Ron Paul wasn&rsquo;t fit to run an abortion clinic&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This is a lie and a non-sequiter. Ron Paul delivered over 3000 babies, he aborted none.<br>
