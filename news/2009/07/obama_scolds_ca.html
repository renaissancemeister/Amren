<h1><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/07/23/obama_scolds_cambridge_police/">Obama Scolds Cambridge Police</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Williams, Boston Globe, July 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama, weighing in on the arrest of Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., said last night that Cambridge police &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221; when they handcuffed Gates even after he showed proof that he lived in the house.</p>
<p>Calling Gates &#8220;a friend,&#8221; and acknowledging he didn&rsquo;t &#8220;know all the facts,&#8221; Obama said during a nationally televised press conference otherwise devoted to healthcare that he didn&rsquo;t know whether race played a role in the arrest of Gates, who is black and a noted authority on race relations, by a white Cambridge police officer investigating a burglary report.</p>
<p>But the president added that it is &#8220;just a fact&#8221; that African-Americans and Latinos are disproportionately stopped by police  &mdash;  evidence &#8220;that race remains a factor in our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there&rsquo;s a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately,&#8221; the president said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s just a fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s account of the incident did not precisely mirror what Gates and police have said. Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct after he forced open the jammed front door to his home, and a neighbor reported it as a break-in. Gates said the police handcuffed and booked him even though he showed his driver&rsquo;s license and Harvard ID to prove that he lived in the house, but the arresting officer said the professor was loud and abusive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama said that when he was an Illinois state senator, &#8220;we worked on a racial profiling bill because there was indisputable evidence that blacks and Hispanics were being stopped disproportionately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Race &#8220;still haunts us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And even when there are honest misunderstandings, the fact that blacks and Hispanics are picked up more frequently and often time for no cause casts suspicion even when there is good cause. And that&rsquo;s why I think the more that we&rsquo;re working with local law enforcement to improve policing techniques .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the safer everybody is going to be.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Obama said: &#8220;African-Americans and Latinos are disproportionately stopped by police.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disproportionately compared to what? To their percentage in general population? If they behaved better and were more law abiding then the number of their arrests would drop significantly.</p>
<p>For instance, Mexicans gained notoriety for drunk driving. So, what a cop can do about it? Go after Swedes until they find one engaged in DUI while ignoring drunken Mexicans?</p>
<p>There is this &#8220;phrase&#8221; perpetuated by the Mexican lobby that someone was arrested for &#8220;driving while Mexican&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rare cow manure.</p>
<p>I happened to know very many Filipinos. Most of them cannot be distinguished from Mexicans while they drive if you look at them from the outside of the car. Yet according to their account, they are not stopped for &#8220;driving while Filipino&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Mexicans&rsquo; unruly (asocial, if you will) behavior that puts them on a collision path with law enforcement. If they don&rsquo;t know how (or refuse) to obey the low they should be kicked out from our country. Then we won&rsquo;t have to listen to their whining about being arrested &#8220;for driving while Mexican&#8221;.<br>

<p>I would not have been angry.  I would have thanked the officer for coming out and I would have explained that I was locked out and thus breaking into my own house.  If the officer wanted me to confirm that I was indeed the owner, I would have understood and showed him my idenfification.</p>
<p>This is what 99.99% of us would have done.  Just common sense.</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/mdtu7w" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/mdtu7w</a></p>
<p>&#8220;But my understanding is, is that Professor Gates then shows his ID to show that this is his house. And at that point he gets arrested for disorderly conduct&#8221;</p>
<p>Very misleading&hellip;it seems fairly certain that Gates got arrested not &#8220;at that point,&#8221; but later, after he had become even more disorderly.</p>
<p>(In this photo of the arrest, I don&rsquo;t think Gates is just exhibiting a bored, open-mouthed yawn):</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/m7vuhq</p>
<p>But imagine the reaction from blacks if Obama had responded in any other way, including not responding at all.</p>
<p>Obama knows he doesn&rsquo;t have to concern himself with the reaction from whites.</p>
<p>The link to the police report, which is very detailed:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/le28uq" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/le28uq</a></p>
<p>Will the media check if the police report jibes with observations of neighbors who were gathered, and to whom Gates is apparently screaming in the photo I linked?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not keeping my fingers crossed. This story is already getting the &#8220;Jena&#8221; treatment.</p>

<p>The question is, are they committing violations disproportionately?  The statistics show they are.  Well, then it would follow that they are being stopped, arrested, incarcerated in disporportionate numbers.</p>

<p>Whose the clown that briefed this man?  He was arrested for his behavior and deservedly so.  What, professors/&#8221;scholars&#8221; can&rsquo;t be handcuffed?  No wonder the country is going down the drain.  With a President and &#8220;scholars&#8221; like this, any direction but down is impossible.<br>

		<p>This could turn out to be quite important in opening the eyes of some white who voted for Obama, thinking that he was somehow beyond race and totally impartial about such matters. Just as Bill Clinton was seen by many blacks as the first black president due to his approach to racial relations, many whites, who would never have voted for a Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton, voted for Obama because they saw him as the first white president (who is black).</p>
<p>This could turn out to cause a shift in perception among growing number of whites regarding Obama´s private thinking on racial matters.</p>

		<p>I see nothing here that would indicate that Gates was targeted because of race.  The police responded to a call and they were making sure that the house wasn&rsquo;t being robbed, and Gates basically pitched a fit and threw in the race card for good measure, from what I read in the report that Ronald linked to.</p>
<p>Obama needs to hush up until he has the facts.</p>

		<p>Will even this irrefutable evidence of Obama&rsquo;s hatred of whitey be enough to wake whitey? It should. But I&rsquo;m not so sure it will. There are millions of whites who are nice and fervently want the world to be nice. They don&rsquo;t want to know their president hates them. Plus, it&rsquo;s not nice to judge blacks harshly. Or judge them at all. So they&rsquo;ll start putting this incident out of mind quite soon. And I&rsquo;m sure TOTUS will take Obama to the woodshed on this one. No more spontaneity out of you! Only stroking whitey allowed from here on. Between whites desire to forget the horror of their situation and stroking from Their Sworn Enemy I&rsquo;m sure this revelation of what Obama is will fade away in the not too distant future.   </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, folks   &mdash;   we have a RACIST for a President.  The fact is, anybody who acted as Gates did to the police would be arrested for disorderly conduct, be they white, yellow, brown, or red.  Excessive anger, yelling, and other tantrum behaviors always result in an arrest, because of the implicit threat within the behavior.  Blacks, and our President in particular, seem to feel that none of the rules of society apply to them.  The truth is, they DO apply; blacks are not going to be exempted from any laws just because they are black.  The cops were right to arrest this guy, because of his BEHAVIOR, not because he was the owner of the house and broke into it.  There are CONSEQUENCES for behaving like an idiot, and if the police are involved, arrest is more than likely going to be the consequence.  What Obama&rsquo;s problem with this is, I cannot imagine, but blacks better start getting over the premise that they are arrested more than others.  Yes they are   &mdash;   and it&rsquo;s because they commit more crimes than other racial groups.  If you can&rsquo;t do the time, don&rsquo;t do the crime, fools   &mdash;   and there are more than enough statistics to support this, but most of the time people are too intimidated by the black agenda folks to publicize them.  That needs to stop, and fast.  People who want equality need to understand that it means equality of adverse legal judgments if they behave in ways that transgress the law.</p>

		<p>&#8220;There is a class of col*r*d people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the N**ro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs-partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the N**ro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs. &#8220;</p>

		<p>I notice that Obama does not mention the Asian minority.  The rate that they are stopped is probably disproportionately LOW - otherwise BO would certainly have included them.  But I guess this favored treatment of Asians is not surprising, since whites, after all, write IQ tests so that Asians will score higher than they do.  Whites would appear to like Asians more than themselves.  Go figure.</p>

		<p>It is all falling apart. He cannot say these are not his friends now and in fact is under a &#8220;solidarity&#8221; obligation. The President of the US is defending people who yell and shout obscenities at police! It is so laughably idiotic and yet a portent of things to come. The whole nation heard his words and many of them knew what truly happened and what this means. More folks will be joining our side after this one.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But the president added that it is &ldquo;just a fact&rdquo; that African-Americans and Latinos are disproportionately stopped by police &mdash; evidence &ldquo;that race remains a factor in our society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, here it is.  Verification of what I&rsquo;ve written several times about this man&rsquo;s pro-black, anti-white agenda.  There&rsquo;s no equivocation by him at all.  </p>
<p>That blacks and mestizos have crime rates much greater than whites isn&rsquo;t even taken into consideration by this pro-black miscreant.  </p>
<p>But actually I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s showing the country in bits and pieces that his 20 years in the pew listening to the degradation and abominable hatred against whites has instilled in him even more anti-white bias than he had prior to that.  </p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve often pointed out that 20 plus years working only for, and concerned only about, blacks makes his claims of fairness nothing but hogwash.  Nobody can spend that much time working soley for just one race then magically become fair anbd balanced overnight concerned about everybody.</p>
<p>Every single one of his actions is for the purpose of helping blacks somehow, and if they happen to benefit another race it&rsquo;s strictly an unintended consequence.</p>
<p>His white sycophantic supporters are too stupid to ever allow themselves to see the real BHO, but many whites already are starting to become aware of what he&rsquo;s up to and how much these programs are just plain incompetent, and there will be many more as time goes by.  We&rsquo;re headed for a big financial catastrophe, part of which might come this year.</p>
<p>This health care bill, I&rsquo;m positive, is being pushed fanatically by him, because he wants all blacks insured.  That&rsquo;s the only real reason for his overzealousness.  That&rsquo;s it.  Wanting control of more parts of the economy might be an additional benefit, but primarily he wants universal healthcare for his black tribesmen.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s turning out just about as I expected.  I knew it was going to be rough going for whites, and we&rsquo;ve just seen the beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard pill to swallow, knowing black on white assaults and other crimes are at epidemic proportions, and this evil, pro-black criminal is criticizing the police for behaving exactly as they would to a white as if blacks, not whites are victims.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that during the primaries and election season, Obama stayed away from black &#8220;leaders&#8221; like Jackson and Sharpton, and rarely brought up race and refused to play the race card.  Now that he&rsquo;s president, we see him playing the race card by attacking the police while defending a black man.  Obama is a race hustler, like the others, just more polished and covert about his agenda and less blatant about it.</p>

		<p> I wonder if this is a hoax. Gates had someone make the phone call about the incident. Then he could rant and rave about alleged racism to make the point that racism exists in a liberal bastion like Cambridge, and to a Black who lives above a subsistence level. A nice research exercise for Afro-Am studies.<br>
 And to a national audience.<br>
 Now White Libs know the name of a &#8220;prominent scholar&#8221; that they should have known about all these years.</p>

		<p>The pres said &#8220;there&rsquo;s a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately,&rdquo;Then he said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a fact.&rdquo; Well pres heres a few more facts. Of the the 1.3 million interracial violent crimes, 90% (1.17 million) are black against white.Blacks murder whites at 18 times the rate whites murder blacks.Black neighborhoods are 35 times more violent than white neighborhoods.Blacks commit 7.5 times more violent interracial crimes than whites, although whites outnumber blacks by 7 to 1. <br>
Blacks under 18 are more than 12 times more likely to be arrested for murder than whites under 18 and theres a lot more facts that can be mentioned. </p>

		<p> Mr. &#8220;Let&rsquo;s Get Beyond Race&#8221; couldn&rsquo;t resist playing the race card for all it was worth when he was presented with a predictably set-up type question and a national audience. The police report as quoted on stuffblackpeopledontlike.com yesterday (and posted on this forum) indicates that Gates was loud, abusive and threatening to police, and would not calm down although given several opportunities to do so. He was finally arrested after disregarding instructions by police repeatedly.</p>
<p> Although any policeman can tell you that blacks are more likely than other races, when confronted by police, to be loud, confrontational and provocative, my guess is that Gates, this &#8220;noted authority on race relations&#8221; was trying deliberately to provoke the police so he could accuse them of &#8220;racism,&#8221; &#8220;racial profiling,&#8221; &#8220;police brutality,&#8221; or all of the above. Many kudos to the Cambridge police officer, who (so far) has held his ground and refused to apologize. If he is forced to apologize or lose his job, I hope he notes in his apology that it is being made under duress.</p>
<p> And one more thing, Mr. President: It is not &#8220;a fact&#8221; that police stop blacks and Hispanics &#8220;disproportionately.&#8221; It is an allegation, made repeatedly by militants of both hues. And by the way: Disproportionately to what? If everything being in proportion to a group&rsquo;s percentage of the population is what we really want, then they&rsquo;d better recruit large numbers of White players for the NBA, pronto. </p>

		<p>Are asians stopped more frequenlty than whites also, or are cops not racist against asians.  I would imagine the answer to that question is no, since on average asian criminality is below that of whites and not even a fraction of black criminality. </p>
<p>I think &#8220;the one&#8221; and his evil troll Rahmbo are going to use the &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; scam to form a national police force who&rsquo;s only purpose is to harass law abiding whites.</p>

		<p>Ranger wrote &#8220;This health care bill, I&rsquo;m positive, is being pushed fanatically by him, because he wants all blacks insured. That&rsquo;s the only real reason for his overzealousness. That&rsquo;s it. Wanting control of more parts of the economy might be an additional benefit, but primarily he wants universal healthcare for his black tribesmen&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree.  </p>
<p>First, blacks are better insured than Whites because according to National Review magazine, about 93 percent of blacks who work work for government or education just about the only jobs left whose employees are all insured.  Those who do not work get medicare and state health benefits.  </p>
<p>I am convinced that the real reason is to deny Whites, especially those over 55 necessary health care so as to kill us off as easily as possible.  I have seen this coming in the 17 years since I graduated from nursing school.  The mantra is racial disparity.  Affirmative action will come to health care under Obama&rsquo;s plan.  </p>
<p>Those of you who are old enough must remember the origninal affirmative action plan of just quotas.  12 percent black in every job and college.  Within 10 years the 12 percent black quota morphed into non Whites need apply.  In medical care, most hospitals have few White employees.</p>
<p>The nurses are still about 50 percent White female.  The physicians are heavily affirmative action foreigners and women.  The technicians, clerks and administrators tend to be minorities.</p>
<p>Government work is about 90 percent foreign and minority.</p>
<p>That is what health care will be like.  No care for Whites.  I have seen it already.  If you have anything to take care of, try and take care of it this year.  If you are over 50, get your entire body xrayed, even if you have to pay for it yourself.  Get things taken care of now.  </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be told 5 years from now that you can&rsquo;t get a hip or knee replacement because of some obscure reason made up by some black or hispanic health administrator. The real reason is of course because you are White.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve resigned from every nursing association except my state&rsquo;s nurses pension system.  Reason, I am sick of the White female middle aged heads of those nursing associations constantly writing articles and giving speeches about how nursing is still a White woman&rsquo;s profession and it is our bounded duty to recruit more and more non Whites and foreigners until nursing will have as few White women as there are White male medical students.</p>
<p>What hypocrites!! If it weren&rsquo;t for White women such as Catholic nuns and Florence Nightengale nurses would still be low paid nurse&rsquo;s aides.  I doubt if Africa, Asia and the Middle East ever had professional female nurses until they were colonized by Europeans.</p>
<p>But the heads of the various nursing associations want to eliminate White American nurses in favor of unqualified minorities.</p>
<p>An excellent resource for everyone are what is called urgent care independent clinics.  They are mostly in cities.  They charge approximately $100.00 per visit.  Being independent businesses, not paid by the government or insurance companies, they will do what you ask and pay for.</p>
<p>That means they will order xrays that show a knee fracture while you insurance company paid physician will refuse to  order xrays and diagnose the fracture as &#8220;chronic pain&#8221;  or a &#8220;bit of arthritis&#8221;</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to buy a book called &#8220;Professional Guide to Signs and Symptoms&#8221; Lippincott Williams.  Become familiar with it.  When you feel you have a medical problem, look up your signs and symptoms before going to the Doctor.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go overboard with self diagnosis, but be aware that bad times are coming for Whites.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more nuanced than this.  His police-procedural views are pro-black, anti-white.  But his (much more important) immigration views, judging by his Senate votes, are anti-white <i>and</i> anti-black.  </p>
<p>Of course, he may only have been trying to please his party leaders, knowing the bills wouldn&rsquo;t pass anyway.  If he continues to drag his feet on immigration liberalization (so-called &#8220;amnesty&#8221;), that would be pro-black and pro-white.  On the other hand, his continued dragging his feet on immigration <i>enforcement</i> is anti-white and anti-black.</p>

		<p>Back on June 24, AmRen ran an article on the upper class blacks of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard and how they came up with ways to shoo away the uncouth black college students who were partying in their exclusive enclave. Professor Gates was one of the names included in these upper class blacks. I don&rsquo;t know what role he played in chasing away the students but it would be ironic if he had something to do with it.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a prediction that I made to my wife just after Obama was inaugurated. I gave him less than a year to implode. His remark shows what an amateur he is in the game of politics. Within a year, he&rsquo;ll be the greatest national embarrassment that we&rsquo;ve ever had - and we&rsquo;ve had some doozies! </p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll make George W. Bush look like the &#8216;good old days&rsquo;. Clinton will appear to be a savant. Obama should have made a very terse &#8216;no comment&rsquo; at least until he did know all of the details. He admitted that he didn&rsquo;t! Talk about stupidity!  Why would any allegedly intelligent man admit that he didn&rsquo;t know all of the details, yet comment that the Cambridge police acted stupidly?  &#8216;Talk about the pot calling the kettle black - so to speak.</p>

Their main concern is getting back at whitey, so they may exploit whites to get trinkets for blacks, and thus stay in power, but if something comes along that will really hurt whites, even if it hurts blacks as much or more, the black politician will support it.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta love how blacks are always trying to lump &#8220;Latinos&#8221; in with themselves. It&rsquo;s part of their game to turn all minorities against whites. </p>
<p>In the black mind, they believe that they will be the leaders in a grand coalition of non-whites, barking out orders to Mestizos, Asians, Native Americans and everyone else. </p>
<p>Blacks artificially elevates themselves to god-like status and this has gotten remarkably worse since Obama took office. </p>
<p>I live in a city in the Southwest that, while majority-White, has a good-sized Mexican population. The police force reflects it too. Many cops here are Mexican. They are nothing but outraged at Obama&rsquo;s remarks. I wish I could share some of the things they&rsquo;ve been saying about this, but Jared Taylor probably wouldn&rsquo;t allow it to be posted here. </p>
<p>In short, where I live, there is no &#8220;Latin Love&#8221; for blacks whatsoever. Quite the opposite is true. And when some smug black politician or talking-head tries to lump the two groups together, the outrage just festers to a worse level. </p>

		<p>I saw what passed as a Press Conference with Barry, talking about his friend, and Mentor. </p>
<p>Barry gave the impression that Gates &#8220;innocently&#8221; jimmied the front door open, since he forgot his house keys. Well, the idiot has a Security Service Burgaler Alarm, which, once tripped, immediately brings a Police response to the seen. </p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t this Genius of a Professor use his Cell phone, assuming the Moron had one, and I am sure he has all the latest toys, and call the Security Alarm Company, to inform them of the problem? People with Alarm Services have pass words, and access codes, to verify that you are, who you say you are.</p>
<p>The other oversight by this Genius, is not having a second key on you, as I carry two sets of house keys, and another at either a near-by family member&rsquo;s home, or with a trusted Neighbor. </p>
<p>Then, Gates was with another individual, in the house, when Sgt,. Crowley arrived at the scene. The Sgt. stated on a News video, which is now on You Tube, that the Professor was acting irrationally, and seemed iritated by the Officer&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not normal behavior for someone who just had to pry open his front door, and is now accusing the Officer of Racism, for respoding promptly, when the alarm went out. Instead, the Genius should have showed the Police Sgt. his identification, and thanked him for responding so quickly. </p>
<p>The Police Sgt., in his You Tube video, stated that the Genius made several comments about the Police Officer&rsquo;s mother, while yelling at him. </p>
<p>At that time, the Officer had placed the Havard Genius under arrest, for Disorderly Conduct, and rightly so.</p>
<p>It amazes me to see that no matter how high on the Social Ladder that Blacks seem to go, they still act like they just left the Plantation, or the Ghetto. </p>

		<p>First, it is absolutely unbelievable to me that the President of the United States would go on national television and deliberately undermine every police force in America, in effect saying that the pigs are all racists and that Blacks and Latinos have no compunction to cooperate with them at all. I imagine that the job of all our law enforcement officials has just become that much more difficult and dangerous. I am waiting for police chiefs all over the country to publicly say as much and to demand an apology from Obama (not that it would help at this point).<br>
Second, if this is the kind of behavior that we get from the best of the Blacks in our country  &mdash;  the most educated, respected, successful, etc  &mdash;  and if the President of the United Sates is going to endorse and encourage such behavior, then I do not see how there is any hope for the reconciliation of the races.  We saw similarly  &mdash;  albeit much milder  &mdash;  aggressive, belligerent, unreasonably defensive, ready-to-pounce behavior from another respected and successful member of the Black community (although you had better not mention that to his face) last week in Boxer&rsquo;s hearing.  If the best of the Blacks keep acting like this then the middle of the road Whites like myself, who can see some of both sides of the race issue, are going to make a sharp turn to the right. </p>

Obama has no clue on how to &#8220;lead&#8221; the nation, so when the going gets tough, he reverts to the only thang he knows. Here is more evidence, where SENATOR Obama uses his ACTIVIST instincts to skewer yet another hapless white man:</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama: Fire Voting Rights Chief</p>
<p>By Paul Kiel - October 19, 2007, 10:45AM</p>
<p>In a letter today, Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) urged the acting attorney general to fire voting rights section chief John Tanner. Citing Tanner&rsquo;s remarks earlier this month that &#8220;minorities don&rsquo;t become elderly the way white people do: They die first,&#8221; Obama wrote that &#8220;Through his inexcusable comments, Mr. Tanner has clearly demonstrated that he possesses neither the character nor the judgment to be heading the Voting Rights Section.&#8221; He concluded: &#8220;For that reason, I respectfully request that you remove him from his position.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tanner made the comments as justification for his decision to overrule Justice Department staff attorneys and approve a Georgia voter ID law that was subsequently halted by a federal appeals court. Tanner made the novel argument that such laws actually discriminate against whites.</p>
<p>Things are only getting worse for Tanner. In a couple weeks, he&rsquo;ll appear before the House Judiciary Committee, where he&rsquo;ll get to explain personally to its 78 year-old African-American chairman that minorities don&rsquo;t &#8220;become elderly.&#8221; He&rsquo;ll also have to explain why he took the unprecedented step of publicly assuring officials in Columbus, Ohio that there had been no discrimination against African-Americans in the allocation of voting machines for the 2004 election. The fact that African-Americans had to wait in long lines deep into the night, he said, was due to &#8220;the tendency&#8221; for &#8220;white voters to cast ballots in the morning&#8221; and &#8220;for black voters to cast ballots in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is second time this month that Obama has come out hard against a controversial figure from the Civil Rights Division. Earlier, he joined with Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) in blocking the nomination of Hans von Spakovsky to the Federal Election Commission. Obama&rsquo;s letter is below..</p>

On October 5, 2007, at the National Latino Congreso in Los Angeles, John Tanner, the chief of the voting rights section of the Civil Rights Division, spoke on a panel regarding minority voters. During the course of that discussion, which focused on recent state laws requiring photo identification for voting, Mr. Tanner said that such photo ID requirements disadvantage the elderly &#8220;[a]nd that&rsquo;s a shame.&#8221; He explained: &#8220;You know, creating problems for elderly persons just is not good under any circumstance.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, according to Mr. Tanner, such requirements do not disenfranchise minorities, and in fact, they actually benefit minorities. He said: &#8220;Our society is such that minorities don&rsquo;t become elderly the way white people do; they die first. There are inequities in health care. There are a variety of inequities in this country. And so anything that disproportionately impacts the elderly has the opposite impact on minorities; just the math is such as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such comments are patently erroneous, offensive, and dangerous, and they are especially troubling coming from the federal official charged with protecting voting rights in this country. Mr. Tanner has already demonstrated questionable judgment in overruling the decision of Justice Department lawyers that the Georgia photo ID requirement would disproportionately discriminate against African Americans. For Mr. Tanner to now suggest, in an effort to defend his erroneous decision, that photo identification are not necessary for minority voters because &#8220;they die first&#8221; shows just how far the Justice Department has fallen. This is a disgrace and yet another reason why the next Attorney General must demonstrate a strong commitment to civil rights.</p>
<p>But, until the next Attorney General is confirmed, you are in charge of the Department, and you are in charge of ensuring that our laws are enforced and that the civil rights of all Americans are protected. Through his inexcusable comments, Mr. Tanner has clearly demonstrated that he possesses neither the character nor the judgment to be heading the Voting Rights Section. For that reason, I respectfully request that you remove him from his position.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Barack Obama<br>
United States Senator&#8221;</p>
<p>Like this officer who is a Racial Profiling Expert, John Tanner is a &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; expert.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did some research and found that Tanner was actually White House counsel for Clinton, worked for Leahey, and he&rsquo;s gotten all kinds of awards from minority groups in the south for his work in the Voting Section over the last 30 years. Maybe he just said something stupid; maybe this was just a stupid decision. I am afraid that maybe we&rsquo;re villifying someone just because we&rsquo;re so excited about another opportunity to bash Bush. Maybe we allow our imaginations to run so that we can demonize people like Tanner and feel justified in some of the horrible things we say in these comments. Maybe it makes us feel better about how reckless we are with our words. I&rsquo;m not questioning our political principals, but I&rsquo;m questioning my willingness to forget about the human side of this&#8221;</p>
<p>When will the &#8220;useful idiot&#8221; white men LEARN that you can&rsquo;t pander to the Blacks, they will skewer you anyways!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t deny for a minute that there are cops that are on a power trip.  </p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think this was the case here.  I think Gates was trying to bait the cops.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Not knowing all the facts&hellip;&rdquo; our Messiah, BHO, gave us his tidbit of wisdom that &ldquo;&hellip;the police acted stupidly.&rdquo; And this one, &ldquo;when it had been established (by picture ID) that he (Gates) actually lived at the address, that should have ended the matter and cooler heads should have prevailed.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Not knowing all the facts yet blithering on is a hallmark of the Liberal Entitlement tribe.</p>
<p>Just shy of ninety percent of women murdered by an estranged spouse in their own homes are assaulted by men who have documentation (state drivers license – Picture ID) to be in the domicile. The responding officer would not have known everything was OK just because Professor Gates showed him a picture ID. Even if Gates had remained calm, understood the cop is just doing his job and cooperated with him the responding officer would still have to make sure he had no outstanding warrants, particularly any restraining orders against him. </p>
<p>If the responding officer in Milwaukee had been as thorough as the Cambridge, MA cop, Jeffery Dahmer&rsquo;s killing spree would have been ended on May 30th 1991.<br>

		<p>Remember the words FROM one of President Obamas heros. Reverend Wright, NOT &#8220;GOD BLESS AMERICA&#8221;&hellip;.but &#8220;GOD DAM AMERICA&#8221;. President Obama was a member of R.W.&rsquo;s church for almost 20 years (do You think He disagreed w/ any of R.W.&rsquo;s teachings?), should any of Us NOT believe that B.O. will through the government be leveling the playing field in American society so that all the RICH will be taxed to the point that they will be close economically to everyone? His goal of destroying capitalism will create zero jobs. so guess where that is going to take Us&hellip;. please take a wild guess! small/medium/and large companies are what make Our economy tick&hellip;if ANYONE can point to any part of the stimulus that helps them they are reading fiction. short term shovel ready jobs are a placebo.</p>

		<p>Today&rsquo;s U.S. News and World Report article by Robert Schlesinger raised a question I had: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Crowley could also have resolved by rolling his eyes at the cranky  &mdash;  but not criminal  &mdash;  professor, getting back in his car and driving away&hellip;.neither disliking someone&rsquo;s attitude nor their tone of voice is good reason to cuff them and take them downtown.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the excellent first comment to the article answered my question:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s not the way it works. The &#8216;situation&rsquo;&hellip;must be resolved completely before the police can leave. In this case, the prof. exited his house yelling and screaming (&hellip;you can even see the officer&rsquo;s hand gesture in the photo telling him to calm down), drawing a further crowd on the side-walk&hellip;.At this point the police cannot simply walk away leaving a belligerent individual standing on even his own porch causing a commotion, the entire scenario / scene needs to be calmed down and settled before leaving&hellip;.It&rsquo;s at that point that the prof. was asked up to 3 times to keep quiet. It&rsquo;s his failure to do so that led to his arrest&hellip;Technically no cop turns his back on a belligerent individual, what&rsquo;s to stop some screaming mad man throwing a brick at the back of his head&hellip;The cops in this case were 100% right on all fronts, from start to finish.&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/nrqdnl</p>
<p>The comment makes total sense  &mdash;  what if standard police practice was to leave situations in which some parties are still acting belligerently? In some fraction of those cases, some sort of mayhem would be committed after the police departed, and then the fault would be laid on the police for leaving before they had resolved the situation.</p>
<p>Reflecting on a harmless but loud dispute that occurred in my own neighborhood recently, in which the cop who arrived was very intent on assurances that everyone was chilled out and would avoid conversation with each other after he departed, I believe that standard police practice is as the commenter stated.</p>
<p>But a man who (I assume) is a major writer for a major news magazine, U.S. News and World Report, doesn&rsquo;t bother to inquire about standard police practice, and why, before writing his article.</p>
<p>Empty, fact-deficient, blah blah blah is all we get from MSM&hellip;never an education. (My thanks to the commenter for supplying the educational part for me).</p>

		<p>The lower-class blacks are all for Obama because he&rsquo;s the new &#8220;massa&#8221; - gonna provide new giveaways to them so they&rsquo;re health-covered, food-covered, money-covered   &mdash;  - and they don&rsquo;t have to even work because they&rsquo;ll be too busy accepting all their giveaways.</p>
<p>Some, but not all, of the middle-class to upper-class blacks are for Obama because at last one of their own has made it to the top.  Doesn&rsquo;t matter what he DOES there - it&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s made it and is therefore their hero.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with money; some of the wealthiest blacks are lower-class; you can take the black out of the ghetto, but you can never take the ghetto out of the black.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The truth is, they DO apply; blacks are not going to be exempted from any laws just because they are black. The cops were right to arrest this guy, because of his BEHAVIOR, not because he was the owner of the house and broke into it. There are CONSEQUENCES for behaving like an idiot, and if the police are involved, arrest is more than likely going to be the consequence.&#8221;</p>
<p>They do not apply. Blacks are not required to abide by the same laws. Slavery is their Nihil Obstat. Does the name Orenthal James Simpson ring a bell?<br>
Nothing short of total separation is going to resolve this issue. Blacks cannot live in harmony with anyone. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the few &#8220;nice Blacks&#8221;.  They&rsquo;re anomalies.</p>

		<p>Obama is an absolute disgrace.  I agree with 12-Claremont: the police would have arrested anyone that behaved as Gates  &mdash;  very believably  &mdash;  is alleged to have behaved.  Gates is obviously a man with a racial chip on his shoulder.  Good for Bill Cosby, at least, for standing up to Obama&rsquo;s slander of our men in blue.</p>
<p>With Obama in charge, these kinds of incidents are going to multiply.  Electing a black man for President  &mdash;  any black man  &mdash;  will always be a mistake in the United States of America.<br>

<p>You are absolutely right.  That is in every police manual in the country.  It is especially important in domestic violence, neighbor disputes and traffic incidents.  Too many people have been shot, stabbed or beaten by neighbors, roommates and family members after the police leave.  That&rsquo;s why police always ask passersby and neighbors to leave and go home and not stick around to express their opinions and give some loudmouth a chance to go off on someone.</p>
<p>That is the basic reason the feminazis got all those laws passed that in domestic violence one party should be arrested, whichever one does not show any marks of violence.  Neighborhood parking, noise, dog and other minor disputes can escalate into violence at any time, especially with so many people having guns.</p>
<p>BTW, the racial group that has the highest rate of gun ownership both legal and illegal is American born blacks.  Given that Cambridge is a high crime area, don&rsquo;t think that just because Harvard officially wants to abolish private gun ownership that many Harvardarians, especially the women sick and tired of the rape threat posed by black predators don&rsquo;t have guns.</p>

<p>SOP in my department if it&rsquo;s not raining or snowing in a domestic is to take one of the disputants outside for a walk while the other officer stays inside with the other party.  Neighbor disputes the objective is to get each party not just calmed down but back in their own house or apartment for the night.  Telling both neighbors that if they don&rsquo;t go home and stay home they will be arrested will usually do the trick if the counseling doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

		<p>Has anyone noticed that it was President Obama and Dr. Gates themselves who were doing the racial profiling?  Profiling, like racial discrimination, can now only be done by one race. </p>
<p>When I complained that I was fired from my Government job because of racial discrimination I was told I could not use racial discrimination as a defense because only &#8220;protected groups&#8221; like blacks and Hispanics were allowed to claim racial discrimination.</p>
<p>A good cartoon years ago had a little boy asking his father what was the difference between affirmative action and racial profiling.</p>

		<p>H.L. Gates is a troublemaker and he&rsquo;s wildly overplaying the race card. And I&rsquo;m sure many many well-meaning white Obama voters recognize this. It might even help them wake up a little. </p>
<p>Whites who voted for Obama did so because of their (naive) belief that this sort of racial friction would soon be disappearing. That in Obama&rsquo;s New, Improved AmericaLand, the ethnic-grievance industry would start withering away of its own accord. That under the benevolent guidance of The One, race hustling and poverty pimping of the Sharpton/Jackson variety would inevitably go out of style and fade away. That this well-mannered and articulate half-black man would bring all the different peoples together   &mdash;   and that publicity-seeking loudmouths like Gates would be laughed at rather than taken seriously. <br>
 <br>
The majority of Americans may well agree that Gates is a publicity-seeking loudmouth   &mdash;   but Pres. Obama has made it clear he does NOT. Obama insulted the police and took the side of the paranoid prof who every morning upon waking presumably checks to make sure there&rsquo;s no lynch mob hiding under his bed. <br>
 <br>
Also, please note that what our president calls &#8220;acting stupidly&#8221; was formerly known as &#8220;police doing their job.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
I predict this Gates fiasco will be the first of many painful lessons white liberals will receive until they finally learn that Obama is not ON their side. And that being lectured to, scolded and punished by a black man for four years isn&rsquo;t actually as much fun as the media made it sound. <br>
 <br>
B. Hussein, far from being the postracial uniter he&rsquo;s constantly touted as, is in fact a pro-black radical whose Alinskyite worldview where &#8220;every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints&#8221; (h/t: M.Jagger) will damage race relations far more than improve them. </p>
<p>As for Gates, he&rsquo;ll be dining out on this for the rest of his life. His speaking fee will at least TRIPLE as a result of this shameful incident. </p>
