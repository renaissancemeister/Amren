<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0711/p25s08-usgn.html">100 Years On, the NAACP Notes Its Accomplishments and Challenges</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexandra Marks, Christian Science Monitor, July 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than a century ago, W.E.B. Dubois predicted &#8220;the color line&#8221; would be the problem of the 20th century.</p>
<p>This week as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) kicks off its centennial celebration in New York, an African American sits in the White House. That instills pride in many blacks and is a testament to Mr. Dubois, a founding member of the NAACP, and his belief that education and opportunity can open the promise of this nation to anyone, regardless of race.</p>
<p>But a duality persists. President Obama&rsquo;s election has not erased deep-seated racism in pockets of the nation or the glaring economic inequities that are the legacy of slavery and which prompted the founding of the NAACP, the nation&rsquo;s oldest and most influential civil rights organization.</p>
<p>Almost half of African-American and Latino students don&rsquo;t finish high school on time. Black unemployment remains twice that of whites. And young blacks with no criminal record are far more often to end up in jail than young whites. That has prompted the NAACP&rsquo;s leadership to pledge on this 100th anniversary to redouble the organization&rsquo;s effort to improve education and reform the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the last century, the NAACP has been at the forefront of the legal battles against segregation in the military, the federal government, and the nation&rsquo;s schools. It&rsquo;s also fought for laws that ensure voting rights and other policies designed to bring about racial and economic equality. But its core mission has always involved increasing educational opportunity, reflecting the way Dubois had seen it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The leaders of the NAACP contend that Obama&rsquo;s election has &#8220;emboldened and energized&#8221; people for that fight for educational and racial equality.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why we intend to start our next 100 years by redoubling our efforts to close the gaps and begin finding solutions that are innovative and tangible in two especially urgent areas: education and criminal justice,&#8221; Benjamin Todd Jealous, the current president and CEO of the NAACP wrote in a recent commentary on CNN.com marking the centennial celebration. &#8220;There remains much to be done.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Karl Marx once said that civil rights was a &#8220;revolution in permanence.&#8221;  There will always be an NAACP because there will always be some kind of &#8220;ism&#8221; to &#8220;fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>All these things the NAACP complains about are in spite of the fact that blacks have the societal winds to their backs when it comes to education and the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>What complete and utter fools to fail to understand that it&rsquo;s not the system, but their population that needs reforming.<br>
They and all their white apologists are the curse of this country, and, shortly, the undoing of this country will be because of them and mestizos.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve wrecked our economy by getting millions upon millions of mortgages they can&rsquo;t pay for.  They have caused our schools, our military, and every institution they&rsquo;re involved with, to be dumbed down to dangerous levels.</p>
<p>And, when they cause the country to collapse, they&rsquo;re so dim-witted they&rsquo;ll insist on being given special privileges for some hare-brained reason that wouldn&rsquo;t fool an eigth grader.</p>

<p>Dubois was wrong. The color line always has and always will be THE problem. The era is inconsequential.</p>

		<p>How little this article conveys the ideals and programs of WEB DuBois. He was actually a black nationalist more in the same line as Malcolm X than a liberal integrationist like ML King Jr. To put it more accurately, both he and MX to a large extent wanted the core of black society to be black economic self-sufficiency, not merger with or dependence on the white economy. MX even did not support integration, like many blacks of the desegregation era, except under certain conditions. All that pretty much went out the window because of MLK, the elite media and their agenda, and the left. Instead blacks now have to fight whites and others for jobs, control less than one percent of capital in the country, and have racism (blaming whites) as their central political program rather than economic development and independence or something constructive. Though the media and others are to blame also, by following black liberals like MLK instead of black nationalists, to a large extent they have to hold themselves responsible for the resulting economic inferiority.</p>

		<p>With the election of BHO, racism has ended. The NAACP has completed its mission. It should disband. It serves no other purpose.</p>

		<p><i>President Obama&rsquo;s election has not erased deep-seated racism in pockets of the nation&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Why would the election of a black man to the presidency erase racism, especially if it is &#8220;deep-seated&#8221;?  Regardless of what one might think of Obama, he is hardly a messiah whose reign will cause an egalitarian utopia to emerge overnight. </p>
<p><i>&hellip;or the glaring economic inequities that are the legacy of slavery and which prompted the founding of the NAACP, the nation&rsquo;s&hellip;</i></p>
<p>This is getting to be something of a tired argument. Last time I checked, slavery was abolished over 140 years ago. One might also point out that slavery also caused economic inequities for poor whites insofar as they could not compete with plantation agriculture. </p>
<p>It is odd that several decades of every liberal civil rights and social engineering programs   &mdash;   forced busing, affirmative action, magnet schools, minority set-asides, war on poverty, etc.   &mdash;   have, apparently failed. Judging from what the race hustlers have to say, it is as if we are still living back in the 1950s. </p>
<p>No one wants to examine <i>why  </i>liberalism has failed to deliver on its promises of equality. Is it because the conservatives were right, that liberal social programs are counter-productive? Or are there deeper reasons for the failure of the races to achieve equality? </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always funny to me when an article mentions how the election of a Black man to the Presidency has not magically transformed this nation, as if liberals really expected Black and Mexican kids to become model citizens overnight now that Obama is in the White House. That&rsquo;s the problem with the liberal mindset - they seem to think that everything happens by some outside force and it&rsquo;s not people that control their own destinies. &#8220;Oh, if only a Black man would become President, then Black youths will actually learn to speak correct english and pull up their pants and stop breaking into my car.&#8221; Keep om dreaming.</p>
