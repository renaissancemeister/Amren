<h1>Atlanta Close to Tearing Down Last Housing Project</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dionne Walker, AP, July 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The nation&rsquo;s bulldozer attack on crime and poverty will soon make Atlanta  &mdash;  home of the first public housing development  &mdash;  the first major city to eliminate all of its large housing projects.</p>
<p>Cities from Boston to Los Angeles are following its lead. For more than 15 years, housing officials across the country have been razing the projects where some 1.2 million families live and replacing them with a mix of higher-rent and subsidized apartments and homes.</p>
<p>Alexandria, La., has taken down at least 247 units. Buffalo, N.Y., has demolished about 1,000 aging homes. Atlanta expects to finish tearing down the last of its sprawling projects next June.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The housing projects in Atlanta date back to 1936, when the nation&rsquo;s first public housing community, Techwood Homes, was built here. President Franklin D. Roosevelt heralded it as &#8220;a tribute to useful work under government supervision&#8221; and the first step in building a safety net for the working poor during the Depression.</p>
<p>Decades of cultural and policy shifts transformed that safety net into a permanent home for generations of families surrounded by disproportionately high crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no kind of forward-looking plan, and no commitment to dramatic change,&#8221; said [Henry] Cisneros, who in the early &rsquo;90s helped craft what is known as the Hope VI program.</p>
<p>Hope VI would eventually provide $6.2 billion in federal grants for demolition, revitalization and planning. It also reversed long-standing HUD policy by letting housing authorities replace demolished units with Section 8 vouchers  &mdash;  coupons low-income families can use to cover rent with private landlords off site.</p>
<p>That meant the nation&rsquo;s more than 3,300 housing authorities could tear down blighted public housing and rebuild smaller, more easily managed neighborhoods while the vouchers would prevent anyone from being left homeless.</p>
<p>At least in theory.</p>
<p>In 1996, toward the end of Atlanta&rsquo;s makeover as host of the Olympics, the city pioneered the creation of mixed-income developments  &mdash;  former public housing communities demolished and rebuilt to include market-rate houses and apartments alongside a whittled-down number of public housing units. Mixing higher-income families with lower-income ones spurs the latter into self-improvement, housing officials say, while deconcentrating poverty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Atlanta&rsquo;s leaders have set up safeguards to ease the transition, including incentives to encourage more private renters to accept Section 8 vouchers and counseling for families facing sudden change.</p>

<p>I do not know Buffalo, NY, but I do know this type of housing. I spent my eary years as one of the rare whites in a black neighborhood. When the &#8220;Redevelopment&#8221; came in the mid &rsquo;50s, we joked that they tore down our neighborhood to build a slum. Then, twenty or so years later, as, it seems, in Buffalo, and the other areas mentioned here, they tore the slums down. Now, they are spreading the denizens of these projects out into the rest of the community. I call it a &#8220;cancer transplant&#8221;. I Googled the Buffalo project, and got an eyefull. There were post after post of reports of crimes in associated with this project. I have copied the site below. </p>

		<p>The city council and HUD would like to send these Section 8 renters to towns that didn&rsquo;t vote Democratic or were too white.<br>
Any town that receives Section 8 vouchers will see their property values fall 50% and police budget increase by a similar amount. Only the most radical left wing thinkers would ever think up such a diabolic scheme to destroy communities that were seen as being &#8220;too white&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The Section 8 voucher program is the worst government program in the last 100 years. Thousands of black criminals have been imported into low crime white neighborhoods over the past 15 years through the Section 8 program. </p>
<p>Mixed income neighborhood = black welfare recipients living in neighborhoods where white people are gone at work during the day. Sounds like a perfect scenario for burglary to me.</p>

		<p>They did this to the Lemoyne Owen Garden housing project in Memphis a few years ago and seeded gangs all over the city. If you live in Atlanta, now would be a good time to relocate.</p>

<p>It was never a &#8220;safety net&#8221;   &mdash;   the public housing in the 30s-60s era usually was built over a so-called &#8220;blighted&#8221; neighborhood (in reality, just a poor neighborhood with cheap rents), with the result that the availability of cheap housing actually declined, and many poor people were either left out on the streets, or forced to spend much greater proportions of their income on rent.  </p>
<p>It took the Feds about 40 years to realize what they had done, and Section 8 resulted.  Rather than rebuilding what the government had destroyed, the program basically set a form of rent control on the remaining downtown residential areas, which skewed the already skewed market even more.  The amount of affordable housing available to non-public housing, non-Section 8 people declined even further, and rents went even higher.</p>
<p>So today, we have a chronic &#8220;affordable housing crisis,&#8221; the result of 80 years of meddling in which federal government and cities managed to destroy the bulk of affordable housing and remove much of the rest from the free market in the name of helping the poor.  The answer in Atlanta seems to be &#8220;more meddling.&#8221;  More Section 8, and the deal-on-arrival &#8220;mixed income&#8221; concept in Hope VI.</p>

		<p>Who are these imbeciles that think up this stuff?  NOWHERE has putting low income people into middle class or higher income neighborhoods ever achieved what this moron says! All these people do is depress property values, rob and steal and deal their drugs and commit the most horrific crimes upon their neighbors. This is just another scam to inflict more forced nonwhite invasion unto the decent law abiding White populations. If we do not confront these frauds head-on and tell them we know what they are doing and why they are doing it, then we will reap what they sow. Can&rsquo;t we scream racism and file a lawsuit against these crooks? </p>

		<p> All this talk about mixced-income housing developments is just bleeding-heart liberal-speak for, &#8220;You guilty White people needn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to be insulated from these put-upon, discriminated-against African Americans any more. We&rsquo;re going to put them cheek-by-jowl with you, and you&rsquo;re going to take them and like them!&#8221;</p>
<p> Of course, that&rsquo;s not the way it works at all. Soon the upper-income residents of these developments start moving out, when they can find a better place, farther out; and gradually the whole development turns all-black and welfare class, just like entire neighborhoods have done in our major cities starting in the 1950s. And the presence of higher-income families doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;spur the (lower-income ones) into self-improvement,&#8221; as the writer claims. The more enterprising don&rsquo;t raise those below them up; the ones on the bottom drag the others down to their level. That&rsquo;s the way such &#8220;neighborhood mixing&#8221; has always worked, in the real world.   </p>

		<p>Having formerly lived in Atlanta, and residing in Georgia still, I can tell you this. All these housing project folk have simply migrated south into Cobb county. Granted &#8220;ATL&#8221; still has some pretty rough areas. I believe what is considered southeast ATL is still a fairly rough place to go.</p>
<p>Many formly rough areas are not near as bad as they used to be simply because as the housing projects go down and the black folk move out, whites, Asians etc. have started to revitalize formerly rough areas.</p>

		<p>Notice another hideous failure of any semblance of balance from the AP. No quotes from anyone even remotely questioning whether this scheme of &#8220;mixing higher-income families with lower-income ones&#8221; would ever work. Crime is attributed to some nebulous &#8220;cultural and policy shifts&#8221; rather than decades of liberalism and making excuses for criminals. The giddy promise of the original housing projects, removing the poor from blighted tenements and putting them into clean, ultra-modern, brand new units is conveniently forgotten in this article. Yet another failure of the MSM to report on reality, and another justification for their eventual collapse.</p>

		<p>This is just sickening.  This is the worst type of government program.  It is not enough that they destroyed the cities.  Now they want to destroy the suburbs.  There is no end to this maddness.  </p>
<p>We have no representation in Washington.  Sure we have many white politicians, but they never ever consider what is good for their white constituents.  If they did, we would not have these policies.  Whites will never be left alone.  Integration is mandatory and this is another way of forcing integration.  It is another way of forcing whites to deal with black maladies.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this scheme tried in Chicago? The result was that not only was much of the rest of the city destroyed, but Milwaukee as well. Isn&rsquo;t it time these failed 60s era social schemes be ended before the entire nation becomes uninhabitable for civilized people?</p>

<p>Too true. They&rsquo;re doing the same thing in Omaha (well, I don&rsquo;t know about tearing down buildings, but definitely the relocation of Section 8 renters to better neighborhoods). This city is turning too black and too liberal for my taste. It&rsquo;s starting to show up in elections, too. A Democrat was elected mayor recently, and the newspaper showed which districts went for whom. Former Republican strongholds are starting to turn more Democratic, and I believe it&rsquo;s because of the apartment complexes scattered around the city that now accept &#8220;housing vouchers.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting to get to the point where I&rsquo;ll have to move out to the country to escape the wonderful &#8220;benefits&#8221; of multiculturalism. And there is no moving to the suburbs in Omaha. The state seems to have given them rights to start swallowing surrounding smaller towns to increase their tax base (look up Elkhorn, NE for an example). Eventually any suburb that&rsquo;s small enough to still be largely White will be eaten by the monster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really getting sick of this.</p>

		<p> Wait, I always have been told diversity is great, and our strength, would not an area that reaches 100% diversification be the promised land? Just think a place with no Whites to hold anyone back from reaching their full potential! A place where an advanced culture can thrive without a repressive Western Culture holding it back.<br>
 If leftist theory is correct, that diversity is a strength, a neighborhood with 100% diversification should be a liberals Valhalla, those liberals should be flocking to experience all of its richness!<br>
  Typical, the White man destroying the concentrated paradise that minorities once again have created.</p>

<p>Obviously another idea only some liberal suffering from RDD (Reality Deficit Disorder) can dream up.</p>
<p>The reality is that the higher income people start to see their once lovely low crime neighborhoods turn into the sort of places you don&rsquo;t want to live or raise kids anymore, thanks to the ghetto mentality people that Section 8 invariably brings in.</p>
<p>Wise government policy would be to keep them all in once place where they can prey on each other and where the cops can keep a better eye on them, but since when has the government done anything that makes a lot of sense?</p>

Here in Buffalo, in the late &#8216;90&rsquo;s, it was announced that the city was going to begin tearing down public housing. This was done under a program called HUD: HOPE VI (apparently, the previous V hopes had failed) in order to &#8216;decentralize&rsquo; minorities. (Funny how when whites are centralized, there are few problems).</p>
<p>HUD HOPE https://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/programs/ph/hope6/</p>
<p>As a result, my once safe neighborhood has been flooded, first by blacks, and now hispanics. Major crime busts are now common. Armed robberies of credit unions by black men with semi-automatic rifles. Arrests for shoplifting have exploded. Our once small and quaint grocery store now has guards and video surveillance in every nook and cranny. Hispanics males breaking into a home and beating up an 80 year old man. A 60 year old woman who was almost raped in her home by a black man but was stopped when her husband returned. A rape by a black man at a small Catholic college. I have had TWO home invasions on my street where previously I had none. Stabbing and open peddling of drugs to kids.</p>
<p>It all began with HOPE.</p>

<p>Sure. The fact that this sort of thing fails every single time is no reason not to believe what &#8220;housing officials&#8221; claim about their schemes. </p>
<p>&#8220;Atlanta&rsquo;s leaders have set up safeguards to ease the transition, including incentives to encourage more private renters to accept Section 8 vouchers and counseling for families facing sudden change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sudden change?&#8221; What could that be, I wonder? An overnight transition from civility to crime I&rsquo;d guess, as hordes of little Mike Vicks are shipped into formerly decent buildings and neighborhoods. It&rsquo;s depressing to observe how many blacks need keeping.</p>

		<p>If this turns out anything like the Cabrini Green closing in Chicago, then they shouldn&rsquo;t.  I saw a PBS documentary on the CGs last year.  They didn&rsquo;t say this directly, but from reading between the lines, conditions among blacks in the CG was least bad when one singular drug gang ran the whole complex, undisturbed by law enforcement.  When a couple &#8216;bangers split off to form a rival gang, the shooting begins.  When the cops come in and bust the dealers and distributors, this only opens up a power vacuum solved by shooting.  When the CG closed and its residents moved to other parts of the south side of Chicago, this created a conflict, because the gangs already in the neighborhood fought with the bangers that just moved in, causing more shooting.  Best to leave beehives alone, sometimes.  I don&rsquo;t like to be stung.</p>

		<p> I am excited to welcome some diversity in my boring, white, crime free, gang free, neighborhood. I am hoping the government<br>
may provide me a guidebook to welcome my new &ldquo;guests&rdquo; just as they do when we occupy a foreign land.<br>
Something like the below may be helpful. </p>
<p> When your new &ldquo;guests&rdquo; arrive please do the following:</p>
<p>1. Never wear the colors red, blue, brown, and positively not white around your new guests, caution should be used also<br>
when wearing yellow, green, black, or any color currently known to humankind. </p>
<p>2. Never look directly at your new &ldquo;guests&rdquo; directly, this is highly offensive, known as &ldquo;mad dogging&rdquo; on the street and could result in your serious injury or death. After all they now rule your &ldquo;hood&rdquo; now so show the proper respect. This of course includes when they are driving by with their &ldquo;ride&rdquo; &ldquo;thumping&rdquo; some &ldquo;dope&rdquo; beat, quickly look down or the opposite direction.</p>
<p>3. Your &ldquo;guests&rdquo; enjoy loud music at all times during the day or night, this calms them, and when confronted during a calming period they may become violent which could result in bodily harm or death.<br>
 <br>
4. Remember also that your &ldquo;guest&rdquo; has a voracious appetite when it comes to the opposite sex, never intervene when they are trying to &ldquo;hook up&rdquo; even if it is a mom, wife, daughter, or any other family member for that matter.</p>
<p>5. Do not snitch (call the Police or any other untrusted outside authority) your new &ldquo;guests&rdquo; will handle all issues and security internally.</p>
<p>6. Keep all doors, windows, and cars locked, bars and alarms are suggested, because we would not want your new guest to accidentally enter a wrong home, after all they are not familiar with the area and its restrictive customs.</p>
<p><br>
7. And above all enjoy your new &ldquo;hood&rdquo; because after all &ldquo;Diversity is our strength!&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Block-busting&rsquo; is back.  The practice of causing &#8216;white flight&rsquo; by breaking up well-off white neighborhoods with blacks is a disreputible but time-honored real estate scheme.  </p>
<p>Every time a family moves to a new residence it causes a surge in econmic activity, in new purchases, in renovations, and in associated moving costs and new debt financing.</p>
<p>This scheme is to bounce white families out of their neighborhoods, so that the money-traders and investors can reap the rewards of so many white families resettling.</p>

		<p>Only a bit off subject - related I believe due to the implications of it: Monday, I heard an NPR local broadcast in Portland, OR where a Black, just arrived from West Africa was asked how was it that he could see himself as involved or affected by the past injustices done to Blacks in Portland?  His answer was that once here, he as a Black man has a duty to learn about the experience of Blacks in America.  That is because African American history informs him of the supposed ongoing of wrongs that he expects is making a victim of him from the moment he steps foot on American soil.  Out of the African paradise and into African American victimhood!</p>
<p>Rather transparently it seemed to me, came the expectation of compensations in the form of government granted privileges and accesses as well as the many privileges that he expects guilt ridden Whites will hand over to them - not least their daughters (I saw a photo a day later of him and his White girlfriend - who looked awfully young).</p>

		<p>Nothing will change for the benefit of white people until white people hold the politicians accountable.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be enough smart white people to accomplish this task.</p>
<p>So be it, looks like the blacks and hispanics have a much greater drive to run the country than the once proud and motivated white population.</p>
<p>Whites will eventually become the new &#8220;slaves&#8221;.</p>

<p>An utter and total fallacy and the Marxist Liberal leader drones know that full well. </p>
<p>The Left will always single out areas that are either predominately or at least 35% white for the non-white enrichment or should that be<i>punishment</i>.</p>
<p>Would they get away with &#8216;enriching&rsquo; the citizens of an affluent predominately or significantly populated black or Latino area with down-at-the-heel racially and culturally alien others?  Not likely and that&rsquo;s because such actions would create a caldron of seething rage and hatred between the races which would inevitably explode into full-scale ethnic-rioting.</p>
<p>We all know the end results.  Decent people and businesses up and leave, pronto. </p>

<p>Really? Were the &#8220;poor&#8221; people in the public housing unaware of the middle class previously? That foolish dogma is along the same line as thinking that if you sit a black kid next to a white kid in the classroom their grades will improve. All they are doing is making the job of the police that much more difficult by dispersing them.</p>

A large chuck of the 7 tril was spent on public housing&hellip;.which is not being plowed under.</p>

		<p>13-Ronald and 20-Queston Diversity  &mdash;  You are both right. In Chicago, the infamous Cabrini Green housing project was torn down and all the residents had to move. However, it wasn&rsquo;t just to the south side. They moved to the west side of Chicago, and the west suburbs. </p>
<p>I know this will be hard to believe, especially to AmRen readers, but crime on the west side of Chicago, and the west suburbs, has actually INCREASED! I know, I&rsquo;m shocked too.</p>

		<p>About a year ago I was working for a company based out of Chicago. They put the new boss from Chicago in an apartment complex that had just started taking section 8 vouchers. Well crime went through the roof (surprise).My new boss being from Chicago did not own a pistol and asked to borrow mine. Of course I lent him my 9mm. Well, he would bring it to work because he was afraid it would be burgled if he kept it at the apt. while he was at work. <br>
Well 4 people knew of the gun,the boss, me and 2 blacks. Needless to say it was stolen out of his office during working hours. (there is a combination lock on the door coming into the office suit. very unlikely someone came into the suite walked to his office grabbed the pistol and walked out without disturbing anything else ..and not be seen). Well&hellip;one of the blacks was fired the day before the incident and the other quit the day after the incident..hhhmmmm. Who could it be?  <br>
Scared of the low class blacks around his apt. he was flanked by the brothers in the office.His was a real change in attitude from a liberal mindset about race.   </p>

<p>&#8220;The giddy promise of the original housing projects, removing the poor from blighted tenements and putting them into clean, ultra-modern, brand new units is conveniently forgotten in this article. &#8220;</p>
<p>I was in high school in the fifties.  My Mom was not working, but she had been a welfare worker in Chicago before marriage.  Several of her friends of 20 years were social workers she had met when she was a welfare worker.  The blacks had taken over whole neighborhoods by then, but Chicago still had a merit civil service system so 90 percent of the social workers were merit system Whites.</p>
<p>I remember how those social workers talked about how the only problem the black criminals and slugs had was the terible housing imposed on them by greedy landlords.  The standard propaganda was that once the blacks were moved into those lovely &#8220;towers in a park&#8221; with big windows and new kitchens and bathrooms they would do well in school, and turn from crime to respectable jobs.</p>
<p>Even then I was a cynic and a bit of a rebel against my parents lefty friends.  We lived in a characterless shoebox ranch on a former cornfield.  Whenever we took the elevated train into Chicago I looked at the miles and miles of beautiful graystone townhouses with their elaborate columms, molding and wrought iron banisters occupied by blacks and wondered what was so wrong with those duplexes, townhouses and small apartment houses.</p>
<p>I was the oldest of 5 children.  We were a rambunctious bunch with 3 very active boys.  Most of our immediate neighbors were very active boys.  Even at 15, I wondered about the wisdom of confining a lot of children, especially boys in high rise apartments.</p>

		<p>Blacks have been a great boon to the construction industry.  First the building of the post WW2 suburbs as a safe haven for the Whites driven out of the cities by blacks.</p>
<p>Then block busting.  The Arthur Rubloff real estate company in Chicago was often accused of block busting.  The procedure was that Rubloff co. would buy a house or apartment building in a nice, safe White neighborhood.  It would rent very cheaply to some black thugs who would be basically paid to go on a rampage of murder, rape, robbery and burgulary.  Whites would flee, Rubloff would buy up the houses cheaply and sell to blacks or to HUD.</p>
<p>Then along came Johnson the patron saint of the destruction of the citeis and the construction industry.  Miles of sound structures were torn down and the blacks were incarcerated in high rise projects.</p>
<p>That was a failure so along came section 8.  Section 8 was not enough so along came affirmative action mortgages which led to a solid 15 year housing boom that is now a major slump because the affirmative action mortgage holders can&rsquo;t pay the mortgage, taxes, utilities and commuting expenses.</p>
<p>It is all just more taxpayer money for the construction industry which now employees mostly illegal hispanics who build houses destined to fall apart in 10 years.</p>
<p>What a country.</p>

<p>At least until recently, Europe had public housing complexes that were high rises, and their residents behaved.  It&rsquo;s not how tall the residential building is, it&rsquo;s the racial makeup of the residents.  New York City high rise condos go for big big money.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just height.  The &#8220;tower in the park&#8221; concept grew out of a statist, socialist school in the 30s   &mdash;   Le Corbusier being the biggest proponent   &mdash;   in which traditional neighborhoods were to be leveled and replaced by identical, unadorned, pointlessly tall towers sitting in the middle of unused green space.  </p>
<p>The biggest implementer of this philosophy was the Soviet Union, which rebuilt most of its cities after WWII to this degrading, inhumane model, designed to isolate people (stacking them in narrow vertical spaces and destroying the common street, making it inconvenient to walk anywhere), while separating them from their culture and traditions (by destroying their neighborhoods and severing their ties and associations).</p>
<p>The concept was never really intended to apply to blacks, but I would not be suprised if the design had many of the same effects, only multiplied many times over.  </p>

		<p>Almost all Koreans live in vast high-rise apartment complexes, far larger than those in the States. Yet crime and blight almost don&rsquo;t exist. Women, children and the elderly walk alone at night, nonchalantly through subway stations and down dark alleys. In Seoul alone are hundreds, maybe thousands, of high-rise apartment buildings, many 20-or-more stories high. While crowded, they are invariably peaceful and pleasant. Many are luxurious. I accidently left my car unlocked countless times with no trouble. I left my apartment vacant for six months with no trouble. Only once was my car broken into   &mdash;   when I parked about 100 yards from the gate of a U.S. military base. Anytime I learned the race of an American servicemember accused of rape or robbery, it was the same demographic EVERY time. Guess who. But political correctness meant all Americans took the blame. So now, in America, we blame high-rise buildings for the ruin and crime that certain people spread wherever they go. </p>

		<p>Having lived in Detroit for much of my life, I have witnessed the destruction brought out by government and low-lifes.</p>
<p>In the 1960&rsquo;s real estate people would move a black family into an all-white neighborhood.  They would send post cards to the neighbors stating &#8220;A new family has moved into your neighborhood.  If you wish to sell your house, please contact me at xxx-xxxx&#8221;.  &#8220;Blockbusting&#8221; by greedy real estate people was only one part.<br>
The second &#8220;nail in the coffin&#8221; was the action of HUD (Housing and Urban Development) with their &#8220;urban renewal&#8221; programs.  HUD would buy up the best housing stock, (many beautifully maintained and architecturally sound homes) and raze them.  They would leave the (substandard) shacks standing.  Kickbacks and fraud were a large part of this.  There was much collusion between real estate &#8220;speculators&#8221; and &#8220;government officials in HUD.  They hoped to depress property values (which they did), buy them at bargain prices and make a profit.  In this, they were successful.</p>
<p>The 1967 &#8220;riots&#8221; started the final downfall of a once proud city.<br>
The third &#8220;nail in the coffin&#8221; was the election of &#8220;mayor&#8221; coleman a. young.  His insults of the then significant &#8220;white middle class&#8221; (tax base) was instrumental in &#8220;white flight&#8221;.</p>
<p>Detroit has degenerated into a third world &#8220;slum&#8221; with little hope for improvement.<br>
The &#8220;money brokers&#8221; have invested in the downtown areas in sports, entertainment and computers (health systems) and have no interest in the neighborhoods. (who can blame them?).</p>
<p>Driving through the mostly burned out neighborhoods, you may see one or two houses with impeccably kept lawns, flowers planted, house painted and well-maintained.  Almost to a tee, the people living there are WHITE.  In most cases, they are elderly and cannot afford to move. The &#8220;black underclass&#8221;  that live in the same &#8220;neighborhood&#8221; have houses that are in need of repair and are responsible for the criminal activity in the &#8220;neighborhood&#8221;.  The whites are subject to much crime and harassment by the &#8220;black underclass&#8221;.</p>
<p>One situation comes to mind.  A number of years, my company &#8220;volunteered&#8221; us employees to get involved with a project called &#8220;paint the town&#8221;.  This was intended to help mostly elderly &#8220;low-income&#8221; people by painting their houses and performing small home repairs.</p>
<p>The &#8220;family&#8221; my group was involved with consisted of a 300 lb black woman, a &#8220;man&#8221; (the woman&rsquo;s &#8220;boyfriend&#8221;) and 3 &#8220;teenagers&#8221; ages 16, 18 and 21.  </p>
<p>We worked to paint this house while the &#8220;three young bucks&#8221; sat on the porch and drank 40&rsquo;s and smoked &#8220;reefer&#8221;.  I thought to myself, &#8220;what (the hell) is going on here?&#8221;  Here you have three healthy individuals who are quite capable of taking care of these things themselves &#8220;kicking back&#8221; and watching &#8220;whitey&#8221; work.  To add insult to injury, the &#8220;woman of the house&#8221; did not like the color although her &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; was &#8220;cool with it&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.  The elderly people that &#8220;paint the town&#8221; was intended for did not need it.  They maintained their own houses.</p>
<p>Although I knew well about &#8220;black behavior&#8221; from growing up in Detroit, I figured that I could help someone in need.  I told my employer &#8220;never again&#8221; would I participate in such a misguided effort.</p>
<p>Name one black-run city that is successful.</p>
<p>What blacks have done to Detroit (and other cities) obama is doing to the nation.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 9:39, I just did as you suggested, and googled &#8216;Elkhorn Nebraska annexed Omaha&rsquo;.  What I found makes me sick.  Elkhorn is nowhere near Omaha (unless Omaha has grown an awful lot in ten years).  It WAS a Danish community, with a Danish museum, etc.  Lovely place. Heaven on earth.  Such a sweet and beautiful populace.  It was my fantasy to retire there. My go-to place for when I escaped the South. </p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s why it was soooooo important to destroy it.  Wouldn&rsquo;t do to have a Danish town in the Midwest&hellip;.not anymore&hellip;</p>
<p>I also glanced at a site for an Immigration lawyer now in Elkhorn.  I don&rsquo;t imagine Danish immigrants are the primary clientele.  OK, I seriously doubt even ONE Danish immigrant has been a client.</p>
<p>When I was there in &#8216;99, I met a young couple of Danish descent, who&rsquo;d moved there from California, hoping to find a decent place to raise their kids.  They didn&rsquo;t have to explain why.  I feel for them.</p>
