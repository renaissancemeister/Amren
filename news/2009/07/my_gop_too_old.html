<h1>My GOP: Too Old, Too White to Win</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Greener, salon.com, July 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Until we [Republicans] come to grips with some fundamental math, however, the numbers simply do not add up to the GOP prevailing in a national election any time soon.</p>
<p>In 1976, 90 percent of the votes cast in the presidential election came from non-Hispanic whites. In 2008, John McCain won this vote by a 56-43 margin. Had John McCain run in 1976 instead of 2008, not only would he have won, but he would have won the popular vote before a single non-white vote was cast. So, {snip} despite any other factor anyone can cite, if John McCain had been the candidate at a time when non-Hispanic whites were the overwhelming majority of the voters, he would be president now.</p>
<p>What happened? By 1988, the non-Hispanic white vote had shrunk to 85 percent; by 2004, it was about 77 percent; and in 2008, it had shrunk to 75 percent. Last November 13 percent of the electorate was black. Barack Obama won almost all this vote (97 percent). Between 8 and 9 percent of the electorate was Hispanic, a demographic Obama won by a 2-to-1 margin (compared to the 40 percent Bush had won in 2004). That means before the first non-Hispanic white vote was counted, the score was 19-3 for Obama. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Just about 18 percent of the vote was cast by voters between the ages of 18 and 30. As a percentage of the overall vote, this did not constitute any sort of meaningful increase  &mdash;  despite what the pundits were saying. However, since total turnout was up, it did mean more young voters went to the polls. Worse, for Republicans, these voters went to Obama by a margin of 2-to-1. Chances are that now they&rsquo;ve got the voting habit, a lot of them will keep turning up on Election Day, and keep voting Democratic.</p>
<p>Then, you have increased support for Obama and other Democrats from cities and close-in suburbs. So, in the major metropolitan areas  &mdash;  where diversity is nearly a religion  &mdash;  you have strong support for Obama from virtually every quarter. Guess what else is located in these urban locations? For starters, you have the major media outlets. Is it any wonder that coverage of the election took on the tone of Obama&rsquo;s election being a virtual certainty? In these locations, Obama was running so strong, it was hard for those observing to see how he could lose. John McCain&rsquo;s strength came from locations that generally were not the subject of much attention by the national media.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To make matters even worse, our weakness among minority voters is somewhat masked when it comes to elections that are not national. How can that be? Thanks to redistricting, and the legal imperative to give emphasis to &#8220;community of interests,&#8221; these minority voters tend to be jammed into congressional districts where they are the overwhelming majority. That means the other districts tend to be more white in nature, and thus more friendly territory for Republicans. {snip}</p>
<p>What this means is that when it comes to an issue like immigration reform, the pressure on Republicans who actually have been elected to office is more often to favor a position that is unattractive to minority voters. If they were to take a different position, they might find themselves facing a primary challenger supported by the party&rsquo;s activist base. So, at the expense of any long-term perspective, the Republican Party is likely to be responsive to the sentiment of the people responsible for them serving at this very moment.</p>
<p>This tension between what the base wants and what the party needs to attract non-white voters is hardly a new concern. In 1960, Richard Nixon did pretty well among black voters. However, after Barry Goldwater opposed civil rights legislation, Republicans never recovered. Some of the very same Democrats who had uttered some of the most vile, racist statements in the history of Congress became the beneficiaries of a block vote for any and all Democrats.</p>
<p>California is a textbook example of the pitfalls of this kind of short-term political thinking. For many years, California had been good territory for Republicans. After all, it was the home state of not only Richard Nixon but also of Ronald Reagan. Then, in order to secure reelection in the 1990s to the office of governor, Pete Wilson decided to take a strong stand on the issue of immigration. Yes, he won that year. However, after that point in time, Hispanics in the state overwhelmingly supported Democrats, and Republicans have suffered ever since. And as goes California, so goes the nation. A recent poll shows Republicans, at the national level, are viewed favorably by fewer than 10 percent of all Hispanics. The word for this is &#8220;disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps we are seeing the start of a level of sensitivity to how the Republican label is perceived among voters of Latin descent. As one observes the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to become the next Supreme Court Justice, it is clear Republicans on the committee are determined to be respectful, even admiring of what it means for her to be nominated. {snip}</p>
<p>Unless and until Republicans can demonstrate an ability to attract more support from minority voters, from younger voters, from voters living in urban areas, it seems to this die-hard Republican that we are kidding ourselves if we think the 2008 election was just a speed bump on our road to a lasting majority. Looking at nothing more than the math, it appears to me our challenge is far more daunting.</p>

		<p>Bill Greener is right, as much as they may bug some of the readers here.</p>
<p>Hispanics are a reality in the U.S. and will remain so, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s two political parties have always been built as coalitions of tribes.</p>
<p>The Democrats are the liberal New Englander and Black Coalition.</p>
<p>The Republicans represent conservative Southern Whites and Ethnic White Catholics in the Midwest and big cities. </p>
<p>Blacks are never going to be Republicans. Face it! They love the hand-outs, the social programs and the affirmative action government jobs the Democrats hand them. </p>
<p>Right now, these Democratic, welfare-loving blacks are aggressively trying to recruit Hispanics into the fold   &mdash;   partly to poke a stick at &#8220;Whitey&#8221; and partly because they feel as if the Hispanics will make them feel &#8220;empowered&#8221; and simply take marching orders from them. </p>
<p>The Hispanic is a natural conservative Republican. His culture is low-European and Christian. He puts his faith and family first. He is often an entrepreneur and prefers lower taxes. Many young Hispanic men are serving alongside of young White men on the front lines in Iraq and Afghanistan. These are very patriotic men who love America.</p>
<p>If the White Republican is smart, he will form a coalition with Hispanics. </p>
<p>Let the liberal, self-hating Whites in New England have the blacks in their coalition. They will eventually implode due to the aggressive and hostile nature of blacks and the timidity of white liberals.</p>
<p>Let the conservative Whites welcome like-minded Hispanics and, together, they can form a strong coalition of mutual support. </p>
<p>The worst thing to do would be to try and keep the Republican Party &#8220;White-Anglo&#8221;. You will simply drive Hispanics into a party (Democrat) that they aren&rsquo;t natural in and they will cast votes against you and serve as political slaves for aggressive blacks. </p>

		<p>Frankly I couldn&rsquo;t stomach this article after the first couple of sentences. The overwhelming majority of whites are still imbued with the love of liberty. Blacks, hispanics, orientals, muslims have no such love. Which makes the choice for the Republican Party very simple and very stark.The party will either begin to defend liberty unapologetically and be reborn as an essentially white party or it will continue me tooing the Democrat statist slave agenda and die.</p>

		<p>The evidence that the Republican party is the mortal enemy of Native Born White Americans is massive and overwhelming. It was the Republican party&rsquo;s low wage labor policy that is rapidly bringing about -in the near future racial -minority status for Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Post-1965 non-whites will continue to vote for  the Democratic party. There numbers will continue grow rapidly. The Republican party will be overwhelmed by this demographic Tsunmi. If Native Born White Americans who now vote Repuiblican wake-up, the complete dstruction of the Republican party will come about much more rapidly. And of course, this will be a very good thing.</p>
<p>So the big question is what will fill the political vacum? It won&rsquo;t be the free market aracial nonsense of Ron Paul so beloved by the writers over at Taki magazine. If Native Born White Americans wake up one day and realize that racial minority status-and the massive unending population growth that will come with the racial transformation of America-will with 100 percent certainty result massive racial discrimination and racial violence directed towards them&hellip;the political vacum will be filled&hellip;White Nationalisn will fill the political vacum. Uncompromising White Nationlaism will be the only game in town when the Republican party evaporates away forever.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a &#8220;Republican&#8221; writing in Salon.  Ignore.</p>
<p>No matter what you do, minorities will overwhelmingly vote Democrat.  Blacks almost monolithically, Hispanics overwhemlingly.  The only way to get their vote is to promise more welfare goodies and more hatred of whites, but then that would get into a p-match with the Democrats, who will always win such a match.  The Democrats want the Republicans to move as left as possible to give them cover for going even further left.</p>
<p>There was a story today that, even though there were 5 million more votes in 2008 over 2004, the overall percentage of registered voters that actually voted went down a half percent.  The reason, they speculate, are elderly whites who wanted nothing of John McCain or Barack Obama.  They didn&rsquo;t have a dog in the fight.</p>

		<p>But it isn&rsquo;t just about winning.  If you surrender your beliefs in order to win, then it is a hollow victory.  </p>
<p>The GOP should realize they can never out-pander the Democrats on race.  Never.  Minorities want a pander contest between the Republicans and Democrats on who can promise the most goodies  &mdash;  open borders, more affirmative action, more social programs, etc.</p>
<p>The Republicans put up McCain  &mdash;  the most liberal of the Republican candidates.  McCain practically supported open borders.  He supported Affirmative Action.  He was as liberal as you can get and still be a Republican.  WHere did it get him?  Nowhere.  Minorities laughed and overwhelmingly voted for the Democrat and many Republicans decided not to vote.  McCain was a disaster. </p>

		<p>The only significant hispanic vote the republicans will ever get is the white hispanic vote&hellip;which is a declining percentage of the total hispanic vote.  The Republicans should focus on issues which will help the country as a whole (which incidentally helps white America).  Stop all immigration - legal and illegal.  Saving jobs for Americans, reducing or at least slowing the increase in energy use, allowing the immigrants here to assimilate, protecting farmland from further development.  Bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US.  A country that doesn&rsquo;t produce anything tangible is a poor country.  Bring our troops home. Avoid other countries squabbles. Stop imposing our style of government on other cultures.  Force our allies to defend themselves.  Less foreign aid, more US infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>There are a ton of issues that the Republicans could use.  But lets remember, the Republicans went along whole-heartily with the anti-white campaign.  They are reaping the rewards.<br>

		<p>No White candidate from any White majority party will ever win again in a U.S. Presidential election.  Any Whites who feel the need to focus on their particular desires and needs as Whites now require a different country than this one.  Either that, or a new country within this one.  I just don&rsquo;t think that the bias against Whites - especially White males combined with the violence aimed at all Whites is going to be sustainable unto our complete eradication before structual collapse of the nation begins.  Perhaps the Russians are right in their predictions.</p>

		<p>1. God bless Barry Goldwater. The last genuine conservative to win the GOP nomination. Yes he opposed the unconstitutional 1964 &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; act. Look what that disaster and the &#8216;65 Immigration Act did! Wrecked our nation more than any other legal measures since.</p>
<p>2. This Greener makes me pity him or just simply despise him. He&rsquo;s pathetic. He&rsquo;s so worried if blacks and Hispanics will vote Republican. The real issue is if the 75% of voters who are still white should vote for either major party, at least for national offices. I say no; neither party will reconstitute American, read White, culture. Both parties are desperate to be PC. Both parties favor huge federal spending and favor big corporations that influence every government decision.</p>
<p>3.  At some point we need a white nationalist party. Then a new constitution. The current document used to be fine, but the courts have interpreted it into something Madison and Washington would be horrified to read. </p>
<p>4.  The Republican Party is the party of Bush, Reagan, and Nixon.<br>
All sold out white people; all grew central federal power(yes Reagan too). Mr. Greener can have the GOP and merge it with the Democratic Socialists of Obama.th</p>

		<p>So this is now an admission by the media that race determines the outlook for the country.  Race determines the culture, politics, and society.  Forty years of telling us race is meaningless, now they admit it is all about race.  So now we are told the GOP needs to reach-out (pander) to minorities, but of course, the GOP must never talk about what is good for the white race.</p>

		<p>     You are exactly why the Republican Party has become irrelevant.When the Gop is smashed into oblivion, Greener can park his ass in the dem. Party where he really belongs. Me? I intend to join the successor Party which will be a coalition of middle-class white people. No corporate asses wanted. No looney leftists and above all: NO freakin&rsquo; Bushes.</p>

		<p> Mr. Greener seems determined to sound the death knell for the Republican party   &mdash;   UNLESS it becomes a carbon copy of the Democratic party. Well, Mr. Greener, as a lifelong Democrat let me tell you that this country needs at least two major parties   &mdash;   maybe more. One of the two is not going to disappear just because it didn&rsquo;t tailor its philosophy to what will please the sons of Mexico and Africa.</p>
<p> Or, to put it another way, political parties don&rsquo;t achieve a majority, then hold it forever against all comers. The allegiance of different blocks shifts with time and changing circumstances. Look at Southern Whites. Fifty years ago they were a very solid, reliable voting bloc for the Democrats. Now they are the same, only for the Republicans. As groups move up the economic ladder   &mdash;   whether through their own efforts, or the thumb-on-the-scale of affirmative action   &mdash;   they tend to become more conservative politically. The Republicans should stick to their guns; their day will come again. After all, in 1935 the number of Republican U.S. Senators had been reduced to just 15, out of 96 members. They came back from that; they&rsquo;ll survive Obama, too.</p>

There is nothing about the GOP or conservatism that excludes non-whites.</p>
<p>That conservative ideas, principles, and aspirations appeal to the white, western mind only shows that non-whites exclude themselves.</p>
<p>Changing the &#8216;complexion&rsquo; would mean compromising principles. If non-whites want to be conservatives, they can be. They don&rsquo;t want to because they don&rsquo;t believe in conservative ideals.<br>

		<p>Everything this &#8220;writer&#8221; said is a bunch of crock! Minorities will never be Republicans or conservative! What few there are and I mean a few, most will vote for the democrats because they are on the receiving end, not the giving end.</p>
<p> When they decided to flood our country with 3rd world people, most of us with any common sense could see what would happen and how these people would vote. That was the plan in the first place. Destroy the White demographic and replace them with nonwhites. Then the take over of America will be finalized.</p>

		<p>I think that is great idea. The Republican party has done nothing but betray the very people who have supported it most (Whites). It might as well shed it&rsquo;s false skin and reveal it&rsquo;s true self. In this way, there will be plenty of opportunities for new parties that explicitly appeal to Whites as a group. That&rsquo;s when the real fun will begin for organizations such as AmRen.</p>
<p>And note how easy it is for them to jettison the entire party&rsquo;s ideology (for appealing to non-Whites will require getting rid of that pesky conservatism) for the sake of getting &#8220;cheap&#8221; votes even if in so doing it brings about the entire destruction of the country. It just goes to show, as Sam Dickson said, what kind of &#8220;jumped-up White trash rules this country&#8221;.</p>
<p>Any new political system must have a means to detect the psychopaths (who lie and seek power just so that they can &#8220;pretend to be at the head table&#8221;) and prevent them from ever holding public office. People like McCain, Bush, Clinton, Gore, Obama, etc., should never be allowed to hold any positions of power (public or private), but rather should given mandatory mental medical care as they are obviously insane and are a danger to themselves and others. </p>

		<p>The Republicans should tell potential non-white voters that for every Republican vote a White person will go back to Europe. Within one election cycle Whites will be gone and we won&rsquo;t have this &#8220;problem&#8221; of the Republicans being too White anymore. </p>
<p>Or how about the Republicans grow a back-bone and stick up for Whites. Then maybe you would get guys like me to vote for them instead of third party candidates. </p>

		<p>Mr. Greener needs to upgrade his math skills above first-grade level. First by learning to subract out non-white immigrants (especially illegals), then dividing our enemies (many Jews and Asians may be peeled from the Democratic coalition by appeals to shared interests), and finally by multiplying our own numbers (hopefully, mainly by natural increase).</p>

		<p>Following this guy&rsquo;s advice will permantly doom the Republicans to second place. Why vote &#8216;democrat light&rsquo;, when you can vote for the real thing? </p>
<p>At this point I&rsquo;ll never vote for either party, but for the Republicans to get my ballot they could throw off political correctness and openly declare allegience to  Western Civilization. Of course, we all know this will never happen in a million years. I feel no sympathy for those losers. </p>
<p>The defeat of those traitors could well change into our victory over time, but I suspect things will get much worse before they get any better. </p>

		<p>The GOP could have stopped large scale immigration, but chose not to.  All they had to do was openly challenge it, and back their objections with a few statistics and simple reasoning.  Actually, any large institution could have stopped it had they tried.  The labor unions could have stopped it, the environmental organizations could have stopped it, the Black &#8220;civil rights&#8221; organizations could have stopped it, solely by forcing the issue before the public.   Now they want to recover their squandered political fortunes by giving away more of our country.  </p>

		<p>That is the kind of thinking that has paralyzed the base for far too long. This past election is a first on so many levels it is completely ludicrous to assume all is business as usual for the next. What previous election produced hundreds of thousands of voters protesting the actions of a president in his first six months? Obama received the benefit of voting white Americans still clinging to the fantasy that racism would be laid to rest with a black president and his mantra of &#8220;change&#8221;. What the past few months have shown all Americans (who are conscious) is that racism is not settled by electing black candidates and that the media cannot be trusted to tell the truth or even crosscheck facts against claims in the most rudimentary journalistic fashion.  The enduring stereotype was that Democrats were good for the poor but bad for business and Republicans were good for business and winning wars. It is evident to all that was re-thought taking a chance on Obama.  Now those old political truisms are not likely doubted so easily again.  Even black and Hispanic voters may prefer to vote in a new president out of their race if it means they get to keep their jobs and economic future.  Obama has broken the machine that provides funding for large government entitlements and has made it clear racism is alive and well in America and it has a black face.  </p>

		<p>But if the GOP gives up on immigration they have to give up on affirmative action and bilingual education as well (In fact, it has already packed it in on these issues - see Bush and McCain - but just for the sake of argument let&rsquo;s pretend they have not).</p>
<p>And then if Hispanics don&rsquo;t vote for Republicans? &#8220;Well see, you gotta be for national health insurance. Most illegals and recent immigrants can&rsquo;t afford it so you are being very racist in opposing socialized medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK - but if they still don&rsquo;t vote for the lovely GOP? &#8220;Glad you asked. All this nonsense about tax cuts and big government is actually a code word for &#8216;I hate Hispanics.&rsquo; The Republicans need to embrace social programs that minorities rely on rather than demonizing them and complaining about high taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, we did that and they are now less likely to vote for Republicans. What now? &#8220;You see, the GOP are zealots about gun control. It is mostly blacks and Hispanics who are dying due to gun violence. Holding onto antiquated notions about gun rights is insensitive at best and racist at worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, we did all you said and they still don&rsquo;t vote for the party of Reagan. What exactly do WE get for voting Republican by the way? &#8220;Oh, you get to chant U.S.A.! U.S.A! every four years as you wave Ol&rsquo; Glory. You can also wear flag lapel pins and  put framed photos of Ronald Reagan and George Bush in your house.&#8221;</p>
<p>The GOP is worthless and it&rsquo;s time has come and gone. Hopefully, nobody who reads AR is stupid enough to still vote for these buffoons.</p>

		<p>From the comments to the original article:</p>
<p>California Republicans</p>
<p>I think you are off the mark here. California is predominantly a Democratic state, but the Southern District is predominantly Republican. Brian Bilbray won Duke Cunninghams seat, after running on a single issue, immigration reform. His constituents are largely Hispanic. I say Southern District, as in Attorney General, where Carol Lam was fired for not pursuing illegal immigration violations. Daryll Issa led that group, he now sits on committee, and was reelected handily. His home town is 40% Hispanic. So we&rsquo;re tired of Republicans blaming the illegals (B1 Bob Dornan) for losing an election. You lost because George Bush ran the economy into a ditch. If anyone wants to close the door on Hispanics, its the Hispanics who are competing with illegals and green card workers for jobs. So the California Republican party knows how to exploit that weakness. For years the local Repubs have been crying about the Latin Leftists, who come here from Mexico with a picture of Fidel pinned inside their jacket.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not too old and too white, you&rsquo;re too corrupt, and if its one thing Hispanics know, it&rsquo;s the mordida. That&rsquo;s why you won a few elections here, because of the Hispanic vote, not in spite of it.</p>

<p>No thanks, chum.  And you&rsquo;ve got it totally wrong.  The reason the GOP is losing support is that it stands for nothing any longer, except the strange notion that they can run the welfare state more competently than the Democrats.</p>
<p>Decent people, people with solid values and ethics, still outnumber the criminal classes, which is to say Democrat-registered minorities.  My suggestion is to vote against any incumbent RINO, even if it puts another Democrat in the House or Senate.  Maybe then the RINOs will get the message.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What this means is that when it comes to an issue like immigration reform, the pressure on Republicans who actually have been elected to office is more often to favor a position that is unattractive to minority voters. If they were to take a different position, they might find themselves facing a primary challenger supported by the party&rsquo;s activist base. So, at the expense of any long-term perspective, the Republican Party is likely to be responsive to the sentiment of the people responsible for them serving at this very moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>This blithering imbecile doesn&rsquo;t understand that there is no &#8220;long-term&#8221; perspective if Republicans favor a position attractive to minority voters. It astounds me that these types of Republicans think that future waves of nonwhite immigrants (a redundant phrase by the way) are going to suddenly become Adam Smith scholars and join the GOP. Jack Kemp was one of the most clueless Republicans in this regard, thinking his economic arguments were going to trump the freebies offered by Democrats and the emotional appeals based on race (unite against whitey) that the Democrats use on nonwhite immigrants.</p>

		<p>The Republican party would become a redundancy if it were to earnestly build a platform that attracts non-white voters as they exist today.  Picture a Venn Diagram with one circle the Democrat agenda and the other the Republican.  There is already some serious overlap, but as the Republicans work to attract minority voters, the circles would have to overlap more and more.  Eventually, the Republicans who don&rsquo;t support this &#8220;new&#8221; agenda would rebel and perhaps form a new circle that sits where the old Republican one did.  No, in order to get minority votes, Republicans need to pull away from the Democrat agenda and build a platform that convinces minorities that prosperity, human progress, and political freedom cannot exist without economic freedom.  Of course, I don&rsquo;t particularly care for multiculturalism, as I think ethno-linguistic fractionalization gives potential energy to ethnic strife.  I&rsquo;d be happy to see a separate nation for each people.  Otherwise, it&rsquo;s just crabs in a barrel. </p>

		<p>Pete Wilson did support prop. 187 (taking services away from illegals),and it passed 59-41.  Put it on the ballot right now, I think it would pass 69-31, as nearly every white voter in the state would favor it.  </p>
<p>I think the author&rsquo;s history is faulty, too, when he sees the schism between Mexican voters and Republicans starting with Prop. 187.  It is more accurate to say that the schism between Mexican voters and whatever party would give them less taxpayer money started with the simple calculus of who would pass out more goodies,and has stuck. Mexican-dominated unions now control the Legislature, and the Dem ascendancy is complete.<br>
  </p>
<p>We have a $26 billion deficit in CA, next year will be similar, and 11/12 is shaping up to be worse, since some of the budget agreements the state used to shift revenues are expiring and local gov&rsquo;s are going to get back the money they&rsquo;ve been giving to the state.</p>
<p>The tax-raising initiatives on the May 19 ballot got slaughtered, and lost in every county in the state.  Californians are going to see real, dramatic cuts to their services, and if taxes don&rsquo;t go up as well it will be miraculous.  </p>
<p>As it stands, we are among the highest taxed people in the country anyhow, so even if they don&rsquo;t go up, the combination of high taxes, worse services, and a joke school system that is 50% Mexican (it&rsquo;s more in the lower grades; that&rsquo;s a K-12 average)is going to lead to rage among the voters here (I hope).</p>
<p>The problem is, that&rsquo;s all it will do.  The bell has been rung, horse is out of the barn, etc.  The demographic wave is crashing on our shores, and it will last for decades.  </p>

I have lived in NYC for my entire life and have had many interactions with the Puerto Ricans and Dominicans here. I&rsquo;ve FOOLISHLY dated some of the women and have observed what goes on in many of these great &#8220;families.&#8221; I&rsquo;ve also met many of the friends of these former girlfriends. (I resorted to dating these women because I could always get very good looking ones while white women with average looks would blow me off.) In addition, I&rsquo;ve attended school with Hispanics, played baseball with them, worked with them, etc. A majority of their families are dysfunctional and the number one characteristic that shows up more than any other is selfishness. Even within their families, they are selfish in their dealings with each other. Most of them also don&rsquo;t follow politics but still believe all of the canards of the Democrat party. The majority will NOT be convinced by &#8220;low tax, entrepreneurial arguments.&#8221; Anonymous, I don&rsquo;t know where you live or what Hispanics you deal with, but most of the many that I have interacted with in my 39 years have not been &#8220;natural conservative Republicans.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>What this article completely ignores is the fact that three-fourths of the people (voters) in this country are white (non-hispanic).</p>
<p>In those states where the Democratic Party has become largely a party of the ethnic minorities, such as the Deep South and Texas, the Republican Party has been able to retain control of state and local government because they have nearly all the white vote!</p>
<p>There is every reason to expect the same effect on the national level. As the Democratic Party comes to identify (exclusively) with black and Spanish-speaking interests, there is every reason for white voters to migrate to the Republican Party*. Some may be clicking their tongues right now, but that is actually the experience in a number of states, where the Republican Party still retains a majority.</p>
<p>It is very ironic that the party of Lincoln and Reconstruction should be reduced to a power base largely composed of the Old Confederacy&hellip;..formerly the &#8220;Solid South&#8221; of Democrat vote.</p>
<p>*After voting Democrat all my lifetime (since 1972), I changed my party affiliation to Republican in time for the Republican primary in 2008. I was not the only white male to do so.<br>

		<p>Republicans must win over and unify Whites in order to gain control of the country.  Minorities, meaning blacks, hispanics, sexual deviants, and feminists, have nothing in common with any section of the current Republican party.  Blue blood neo-cons bent on militarizing the whole world for democracy to Ron Paul libertarians hold no interest for the chosen ones of the left.  None of these groups will respond to any entreaty by the socialist elephants.</p>
<p>I care nothing for the Republican party per se and do not believe it is anymore redeemable than the federal government itself. The party, or any part for that matter, is merely a vehicle to be used to obtain political power.  Currently the mainstream leadership are neither pro-White, nor pro-liberty.  </p>
<p>I think it was Pat Buchanan who recently did some analysis on the demographics and pointed out it is not necessary to pander to hispanics to gain control of the feds, but to simply increase the percentage of Whites.  Personally I&rsquo;d like to see a White nationalist Libertarian party, but that will never happen.</p>

		<p>With their support of mass immigration the Republicans signed their own death warrant.  McCain was one of the worst, as he was a big backer of illegal immigration as well.  At least lefty Michael Moore knew what he was talking about when he said he couldn&rsquo;t wait for whites to become a minority so that Americans would vote in socialism.  Although I bet even he was surprised at how quickly that happened (well before whites became a minority).</p>
<p>The Republicans will never do what they would really have to do to get my vote:</p>
<p>1.  Stop illegal immigration.<br>
2.  Drastically reduce legal immigration.<br>
3.  End affirmative action and all racial set asides.<br>
4.  Balance the damn budget.<br>
5.  End the empire and bring the troops home.<br>
6.  Vote as a bloc against the confirmation of Sonia Sotomayer.</p>
<p>Ron Paul would have done (1), (3), (4), and (5) and would never have saddled us with a Supreme Court nominee who is a member of La Raza, so he was far better than any of the alternatives.  The Republican establishment hates him.<br>

<p>Anonymous, you are sadly mistaken.  Some Mexicans are great folks, some aren&rsquo;t.  Family values, haha.  A lot of the Mexican guys I know value &#8216;families&rsquo; so much, they want two or three families!<br>
Patriotic - you betcha!  They love Mexico a lot, put Mexico first, Mexican colors on their trucks, etc.<br>
Serving alongside whites?  Ticket to citizenship my amigo.<br>
When the stupid Republican party fails, that will be a good thing. Maybe then we&rsquo;ll have a White Party.</p>

		<p>Our Canadian version of the Republican party is the Conservative party.  A few years back under Prime Minsister Brian Mulroney bad policies helped their ultimate decimation under new conservative prime minster Kim Campbell.  She was wiped out in the election and so was the conservative party.</p>
<p>A western reform movement which started in Alberta was hijacked by the conservatives and over a few years became the current version of the conservative party.</p>
<p>So now we are back to a similar traitor party and the western reform party is history.</p>
<p>Sad.</p>
<p>And thanks to people like current pm Harper.</p>
<p>Canada is a mess and getting worse every year.</p>
<p>More and more blacks in our once 100 percent white community.</p>

		<p>Yes, I am a White man. I am by no means &#8220;Old&#8221;, but I am not a 20 year old, either. So, I&rsquo;m too White? No. The Republicans are too stupid to know what they have had, and lost. Which is why I am not a Republican any longer. And I won&rsquo;t be going back. </p>
<p>To be fair, I was more Conservative, and voted for the most Conservative Republican on the ballot. They are few and far between, today. I did vote for Pat Buchanan, when he ran during the Presidential Primaries.</p>
<p>The GOP is out to bring in as many non-White members as it can, much like the Elks Lodge, that seems to be on a drive to recruit as many East Indians as they can, into their Membership.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there any place that I can go, to be around regular Americans, any longer? </p>
<p>It has been stated here, and I know that I have said it countless times, that a new Political Party, for Whites only, or certainly, for White interests, and the Preservation of Western Culture, needs to be formed. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop talking about it, and do it.</p>

		<p>First of all, Whites are still the overwhelming majority of voters, 71% of the electorate (75% in this article is counting Middle Easterners).  John McCain won 55.6% of the White vote and would have won the election if he had garnered about 60%.  That&rsquo;s hardly an impossible task to accomplish. Also remember alot of conservatives voted for Obama to teach the Repulican Party a lesson.  It seems to me the Republican Party&rsquo;s priority should be to increase their White voter base not chase after mestizos.   </p>

		<p>This so called republican is a stooge for the democrats. Salon is an ultra left wing rag. It&rsquo;s laughable this fool believes pandering to anti-white hispanics is the way to win elections. It didn&rsquo;t help the ultra RINO McCain in any way. McCain pandered to hispanics as much as possible and they overwhelmingly rejected him.  The hispanics with the exception of Cubans, hate republicans. Pandering to minorities only turns off white republicans and conservative democrats and gives them little or no incentive to vote. Obama won because a pet dog could have beaten McCain.</p>

<p>Obviously you are an enemy of Native Born White Americans. Now let&rsquo;s suppose the Republican party could remain a viable political party if it could attract hispanics,asians,muslims and some blacks. Why should Native Born White Americans vote for a party-Repubilican party- that is waging a vicious race war against them-combined with  low wage labor party that will make it impossible for millions of young White Males to afford a wife and kids? In other words, what&rsquo;s in it for Native Born White American Males? Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Now this is all very obvious. So the obvious question is:what happens if Native Born White American Males-and their female family memebers- fight back against their racial dispossession at the hands of Republican party-Democratic party insiders,hispanics,asians,muslims and blacks? This is the part that you and other race-relacement enthusiasts leave out. It is obvious what would happen if Native Born White American Males fought back. Steve Sailer makes a lot  of posts on his blog and vdare.com about the racial dispossession of White Males but he nevers raises the obvious about what would happen if Native Born White Males-and their female family members-fought back against their race replacement.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t be too hard on the GOP. They stand a good chance with Obama&rsquo;s asinine spending spree. A whole lot of people are taken back by the stupidity of trying to force a national health care program down our throats.</p>
<p>WHY? Because of the intolerable cost. Besides, who wants to go to a clinic. Wait in line for hours&hellip; to get maybe five minutes time from a physician.</p>
<p>With a 300 million-PLUS population, a European system would bankrupt us pronto! There&rsquo;s a vast difference between a 40-60 million total population and our 300+ million. A difference translatable to COST!</p>
<p>Never mind that we&rsquo;re already another trillion or more in debt from the bailouts and stimulus packages.</p>
<p>The Democrats have a long and bad reputation as THE TAX AND SPEND PARTY! Which should hopefully give thinking people some pause in November, 2010.</p>
<p>The blunder in 2008 is definable as McCain-Palin. Two losers with tons of excess baggage and bad karma. Blacks are something like 12% of the population&hellip; numbers easily overcome by the number of intelligent White voters. So let&rsquo;s not write the Republicans off just yet. By this time NEXT year, disenchantment with Obama, the Magnificent, should be at a record high.</p>

		<p>The Republicans must also stop being cowards.  In his first term Michael Bloomberg, liberal mayor of NYC, would periodically be called racist or homophobe for some decision he made.  A sound decision that had nothing to do with race or sexual orientation.  Rather than say I am sorry and beg forgiveness he just said no, I am doing this because I feel it is the right thing to do.  He never backed down or was intimidated.  If the Republicans could actually do and say what was right, and stick to it, without letting Rev. Jesse scare the tar out of them, maybe they could garner more white votes, and even non-white votes, because they stood for what was right.</p>

		<p>As many have pointed out, people who advance this &#8220;too white&#8221; theory are either dishonest or innumerate. The GOPs refusal, born of blindness or stupidity, to acknowledge the failure of this approach is remarkable, as they&rsquo;ve just lost an election their candidate for which is exactly the sort of politician they&rsquo;re always told they &#8220;have&#8221; to run to succeed. I care less every day about the GOP; they and their black chairman have little interest in anything except holding or regaining office. Placing hope in them is a bad idea. Let them back into office as the result of dissatisfaction with B. Hussein Obama&rsquo;s socialism, and in no time they&rsquo;ll be yodeling their usual self-congratulatory nonsense about how &#8220;civil rights&#8221; legislation couldn&rsquo;t have passed without them, how &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Martin Luther King was really a Republican, properly interpreted, and how mestizos are &#8220;natural, family-values conservatives.&#8221; Why give the political time of day to anyone who could spout such imbecilities with a straight face? The average Republican is Arlen Specter or John Warner, not Ron Paul. Let them go the way of the Whigs.</p>

		<p>Rarely have I read responses that I agree with all of them, and find very little to add. But this is one.</p>
<p>The one final thought that sticks with me is in my opinion (and I heartily hope I&rsquo;m completely off the mark here) is that it&rsquo;s too late to get back what we&rsquo;ve lost. It&rsquo;s not just the U.S. that&rsquo;s imploding under massive liberalism; it&rsquo;s the whole world. It&rsquo;s hard to buck that size trend.</p>

		<p>Folks, there is a sunami building, and it consists of middle-class Americans (primarily White) who will be forced to rise up against this soft tyranny coming out of Washington DC.<br>
As Obama&rsquo;s real agenda becomes more and more apparent to citizens in the days and months ahead, and white people finally understand that he is a Marxist dedicated to the destruction of white culture in America through massive redistribution of wealth (see Tax and Cap, healthcare, etc), the road to be taken will become quite obvious in the future.<br>
It is the way of US politics that the pendulum, once it swings further in one direction, will swing back equally as far in the other direction&hellip;and Western Civilization hangs in the balance.<br>

		<p>Many of the posters think that the future of the white race is in the hands of the so called conservative parties, what I dont beleive.:</p>
<p>From the end of WWII until today the conservative parties in all western countries had enough chance to prove they worth to the working class and native people who they supposedly serve. They severly failed. All of the western counties are being overrunned by third world aliens, freedom of speech has been limited, our traditional values are compromised to appeal the third worlders. I know that the actual nemesis of white countries is the liberalismus, but the conservatives had more than one chance to negate liberal policies. They failed to do so. </p>
<p>If the conservative parties faild us because they are incapable than I say we do not need loosers. We will not get a lot of opportunities in the future, and we must use them proper.</p>
<p>If the conservative parties failed us becaues they are in league with the liberals or serve other alien interrests, I say we need no race traitors. A traitor is not any better that the enemy itself. </p>
<p>I am beginning to think that the liberals and neocons are playing the good cop - bad cop game. The libs are the bad cops, the cons are the good cops (in relation with the white race). In reallity they both are against us, or at least not for us.</p>

Even Ron Paul doesn&rsquo;t oppose legal immigration, as far as I know.  There is nobody for 60% of the White voters to support, so there is no way we can win an election.  </p>

&#8220;The GOP could have stopped large scale immigration, but chose not to. All they had to do was openly challenge it, and back their objections with a few statistics and simple reasoning. Actually, any large institution could have stopped it had they tried. The labor unions could have stopped it, the environmental organizations could have stopped it, the Black &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; organizations could have stopped it, solely by forcing the issue before the public. Now they want to recover their squandered political fortunes by giving away more of our country. &#8220;</p>
<p>The reason the GOP didn&rsquo;t stand up against rampant immigration was that the GOP has been in the pocket of the corporate interests for a long time now.  They want cheap labor, it is as simple as that.  Both parties want the middle and lower class to be easily manipulated and that means importing desperate people who have little idea of their rights and responsiblities as Americans, no matter how they are sworn in as citizens or not.  Conservative Christian churches have abused immigration and assylum laws to gain more converts through missions abroad and they tell them how to vote.  The leftist, most often Catholic churches - or Unitarian type churches do the same thing for their own gain.</p>
<p>So the problem is a complex one, with more factors than I have listed above.  The problem is that everyone has been cheating for decades and the deck was long stacked against conservative America since 1965.  The problem with conservative America is that they often can&rsquo;t see any solutions other than forcing their own backward societal formula onto everyone.  For example, I wonder how welcomed I would be as a socially conservative freethinker who is not a believer and thinks socialism of a sort for Whites only is a good thing for White survival.  </p>
<p>This is the probem; lack of imagination and vision coupled with already failed notions of dog eat dog competion that has only provided every generation with scams and delusions until it is now compounded many times by the computer age and the crash of ethics that has accompanied it.  If all we can do is insist on laissez-faire capitalism, segregation all the while insisting on our bloated pensions and perks such as free health care (the dwindling few that do) and all the while insisting on adherence to the &#8220;words of Jay-sus,&#8221; we will rightfully fail.  If we cannot see that road worn out as it is, strewn with potholes and bogs, then perhaps we are collectively as intelligent as we so often insist statistics and history proves.<br>

		<p>The objective should be the establishment of a viable third party. A name proposed is the Progressive Libertarian Party. The philosophy implied sends a beacon of hope to all those who are truly dismayed by the socialistic policies of BHO.<br>
 Take medical care for example. As we know, those policies will be catastrophically expensive and will prove to be the force that undoes this country by tearing the population apart into two hostile camps: the ones that pay and the ones that don&rsquo;t. Worse, not only will the ones that pay chip in more than ever, they will be reviled while they do so (by the class conscious Democrats) and will not receive any more privileges than those who don&rsquo;t. Socialized health care will not &#8220;level&#8221; the playing field but tilt it against those who have the means to pay for private care; because those people will not find private doctors available. Worse, this will happen against a backdrop of memories of a once great medical establishment rendered asunder by government control. Worse yet the class divisions will be intensified by racial antagonisms.<br>
In just this one area alone I see nothing but refutation of BHO&rsquo;s supposed policy of bringing the people together in a transcendant unity. I imagine in a few years the divisiveness in the USA will become so marked the &#8220;hope and change&#8221; and &#8220;post-racial&#8221; story lines will be the source of chronic cynicism. Added to this cynicism the fears of an abandoned middle/working class and a scenario of implosion develops. The classes who will be the recipients of Democratic Party benefits are not capable of leading this country anywhere except into further crisis.<br>
I imagine many productive people will embrace secessionism; what will they have to lose?</p>

		<p>Mr. Greener, who wrote the article, is a long-time Republican party strategist. The GOP is one of his main clients. He is looking for a way to sell the Republican brand. Perhaps Salon is an odd place to post his article, but he is certain to get a sense of the the perceptions of the Republican Party out there in the blogosphere. Some of the perceptions will, obviously, be harsh, given the audience at Salon. It&rsquo;s a focus group on the opposition for him. A quick way of seeing how his client is perceived, how the product can be sold.</p>
<p>To put such an article on a right-wing site is pointless. You  are already sold on the brand and don&rsquo;t want to hear his worries. Look at the comments here  &mdash;   you are offended. He must be a liberal. But why are you so sold on this?</p>
<p>The question, really, is whether the social conservatives (which I am emphatically not) and the fiscal conservatives (which I am to some extent) can remain housed in the same party, along with the neo-cons. I&rsquo;m not even mentioning the rich white men who front for corporate interests, as those are present in both parties. The views of the fundamentalist religious conservatives turn off the fiscal conservatives, who want the government out of their lives and believe that what government there is should be responsible fiscally with their hard-earned money. The religious conservatives want their views enforced on the big government level. The neo-cons want a big government, with no oversight  &mdash;  and basically hijacked the party by wrapping themselves in the God-and-country cloak. All, by unconditionally supporting a corrupt, anti-rule-of-law, spendthrift, morally bankrupt administration during the Bush years, simply because it was labelled &#8220;Republican,&#8221; have made their own goals less obtainable. Mr. Greener&rsquo;s wish to broaden the appeal of the GOP neglects the failure of the GOP to stand by any of its varied supposed principles.</p>
<p>Perhaps the solution is to break up the GOP and reconvene separately, per our/your repective specific interests, elsewhere. The goals of the fiscal conservatives are not those of the social conservatives. Both are adverse to the agenda of the neo-cons.</p>
<p>If you want the principles you believe in to be fought for, rather than just mouthed, look elsewhere. Join another party and make it as strong as you can. This party is run by people who do not care, they only want your votes. They do not respect your desires. They want the power, not the responsibility. They do not want power to help you. The power is used to help corporate interests and to line the pockets of wealthy friends. The big tax cuts went to the wealthy: you got a couple hundred bucks back. Your goals, you solid conservative middle class and you staunchly religious conservative folk, are left on the platform. Don&rsquo;t you want more than lip-service?</p>
<p>Some here and elsewhere have posited that grooming black and Hispanic Republicans for office might do the trick to expand the Republican base. But at what cost to the present base?  Would the Southern Republicans vote for them?  If Obama had been the Republican nominee, and McCain the Democrat, would this bloc have voted for Obama?  I rather doubt it.  It would be Sarah Palin all over   &mdash;   she appealed greatly to the religious conservatives, but horrified others. Mr. Greener&rsquo;s spin team can&rsquo;t get it all, and neither can you with the GOP.</p>
<p>The two party system is not necessarily the only way. Many countries have more than two viable parties. No reason that the U.S. cannot branch out also. You disgruntled Republican voters have power, you know. You can do this. You don&rsquo;t have to do what the bigwigs tell you to do. Join a party or even start a party that believes what you believe   &mdash;   whichever party you choose will be happy to have your votes, and if you come in droves, you will have a say. Let the neo-cons play their oligarchical corporate games by themselves. They only want your votes.  </p>
<p>Just because you have bought the brand for so long does not mean you cannot switch.<br>

		<p>  I think we have to be pragmatists when it comes to voting. If a Republican candidate comes closest to our views, we should vote for him  &mdash;  the same thing for Democrats. With that said, I believe that we really only have one party in America  &mdash;  the establishment party. Maybe, a third party like the BNP will come into existence but I wouldn&rsquo;t hold your breath. The odds are stacked against them. In any case, either whites start voting as an ethnic block, like minorities, or we&rsquo;re finished here in America.</p>

		<p>Mr Greener and apparently a certain amount of posters on this thread are suggesting that we, the founding stock of white Americans must accept our demise and the destruction of our country because it is &#8220;inevitable&#8221;. That even though it is the same folks/government/industry who orchestrated this wholesale invasion of our country with that same idea in mind we must go along with it for the good of the &#8220;party&#8221;.

Reach out to them although they are invaders here in our country. Embrace all that goes along with that even though it destructive to us. I guess since it is &#8220;inevitable&#8221; and we really have no culture, race or way of life to protect we should just roll over and die&hellip;Well I&rsquo;ve got news for Mr Greener and all of you that embrace Mr Greeners suggestions.</p>

		<p>First of all, the election was lost when the stock market tanked in September.  If the bailout doesn&rsquo;t work, the 2012 electoral map could completely reverse.</p>
<p>That said, the most important group to &#8220;turn&#8221; isn&rsquo;t Hispanics, it&rsquo;s white women, who supported McCain four percent less than white men did (57-53).  The advocates of affirmative action are careful to include &#8220;women AND minorities&#8221; among those deserving help, because just minorities wouldn&rsquo;t have the political clout to push an agenda by themselves.  Someone needs to make the case that affirmative action is no longer needed for women, because after one generation the lingering effects of past discrimination disappear (since everyone had both a mother and a father, sisters inherit the same opportunities their brothers do).</p>
<p>Hopefully, ignorant college feminists will grow up when they enter the real world.  And stop making &#8220;Western culture is irredeemably sexist&#8221; speeches, while simultaneously complaining about the worldwide status of women in every other culture.  Also, community safety is an extremely important issue to women, and one which the right kind of case could turn their commitment to diversity.</p>

		<p>Trying to revive the Republican party is a just waste of time. Let it die. The Republican party at its core rots. It rots because it is commited to 1)the race replacement of Native Born White Americans 2)a criminal and treasonous foriegn policy and 3) a low wage labor policy for Native Born White Americans. The Republican party will never change  on these issues, and it will not change because at its core the Republican party is owned by powerfull corporations.</p>
<p>At the most fundamental level White Nationalists must be opposed to the 1)race replacement of Native Born White Americans 2) a criminally interventionist foriegn policy 3)restoration of Native Born White Americans to 90 percent majority status and 4)opposition and intolerance to the legalization of homosexual marriage.</p>
<p>At the most fundamental level, White Nationlaist must take the idea of democracy and self goverment very seriously. This means a committment to building politial strucures transfers power away from the current top down politcal system. Get rid of the US Senate. Native Born White Americans are going to have to be very vigilent. No more sloth and sports entertainnment. Sports Entertainmnet is a narcotizing effect on millions of White Male  brains. All of this must happen before WE start talking about a political party.</p>

		<p>I see a lot of comments here about evil socialism and Barack Obama. Lets get certain things clear:Barack Obama is pushing a managed care health care system and the insurance companies are very happy about this. It is very far removed from a single payer system.</p>
<p>I know of a 26 year old Native Born White Woman who just passed away from a very agressive form of breast cancer. Her insurance company came to the very rational capitalist conclusion that her life ws not worth saving because her treatment was too expensive. The health care system that some of you here support-corporate managed care is evil. There are lots of horror such as this one these days.</p>
<p>There is not one socialist among Barack Obama&rsquo;s econimc advisors. They all come from Wall Street and the Hedge fund industry. Some people who post here such as myself  actually know what the facts..and we don&rsquo;t get them from Sean Hannity and Bill O&rsquo;Rielly.</p>

If the White Republican is smart, he will form a coalition with Hispanics. </p>
<p>Let the liberal, self-hating Whites in New England have the blacks in their coalition. They will eventually implode due to the aggressive and hostile nature of blacks and the timidity of white liberals.</p>
<p>Let the conservative Whites welcome like-minded Hispanics and, together, they can form a strong coalition of mutual support. </p>

<p>Anonymous posted at 5:47 (1st poster), let&rsquo;s see how you feel in about 15 to 20 years after a good number of hispanics become senators, judges, law makers, and very possibly obtain the POTUS and they start driving &#8220;entitled&#8221; white americans away from their lofty statuses here in the United States!  Make no mistake about it Anonymous, you are not gonna hear any conscious minded, self-loving Hispanic talking about forming any sort of &#8220;coalition&#8221; with any of you &#8220;patriotic and benevolent&#8221; conservative whites and us self-hating blacks.  </p>
<p>If anybody in their right mind thinks just for a split NEW YORK second that the confirmation of Sotomayor to the Supreme Court is gonna bring about a harmonious relationship between the whites and the Hispanics, THEY ARE IN FOR A NIGHTMARISH AWAKENING and need immediate brain surgery!  </p>
<p>What I see along with my conscious minded brothas and sistahs (eubonics intended) as far as the intelligent hispanics are concerned, is them placing themselves within positions of strength before making a SERIOUS POWER PLAY against the whites in this country!</p>
<p>Believe me when I say this Anonymous, they are gonna make a SERIOUS MOVE within the next 2 decades and place these self-hating blacks, touchy-feely white liberals, and flag waving, conservative white americans in PERMANENT CHECK MATE! In conclusion Anonymous: This is a very high tech chess game and these hispanics are playing for keeps!</p>

		<p>I tend to be conservative when it comes to money. I want the government out of my pockets. Minorities who are republicans tend to own businesses or are very succesful. We are just as sick and tired as everyone else of the democrats plan to tax us to death to pay for all their entitlement programs.  40% of americans don&rsquo;t pay taxes, the top 1-2% pays 30-35% and the middle class pays the rest. Republicans are the only hope for capitalism. I hope they will fight against obama&rsquo;s socialised medicine and tax and kill bill that will force some of us to pay as much as 65% of our total income to the grovernment to pay for it.</p>

		<p>Having grown up and lived in Southern California for most of my life, I could see much truth in both Anonymous&rsquo;s#1 and Esteban&rsquo;s #54, differing narratives on &#8220;hispanics&#8221;, especially Mexicans. Even if half are in the group Esteban described, we are talking about millions of people. Millions of people of the type he described is a bad omen for the future of this country. I saw a glimpse of that future, during the GRAN MARCHES IN LOS ANGELES and other major U.S. cities. These folks were not shy and certainly not in the &#8220;shadows&#8221;.</p>
<p>I remember a scene in Denver, Colorado, and how thousands of illegal alien foreign nationals were leaning against and hanging on to beautiful American monuments in the town square, while  American flags were flapping overhead on the government buildings, and the Mexican flags were flapping from hand held poles, many of them with a small American flag underneath and turned upside down. It was quite a sight in this very clean looking and beautiful American town square. It kind of annoyed me, to tell you the truth. I don&rsquo;t say these things to instigate anything, or denigrate anyone, but how can one see this kind of stuff and remain neutral? It even shocked some hispanics that are here illegally. That has always been the bizarre part of it all to me, how some &#8220;Americans&#8221; remain neutral to these things. Yet enough of them they do. Doesn&rsquo;t bug them in the slightest.</p>

		<p>The purpose of a political party is to enact the shared platform and values of its members.  It can only do so if it wins.  </p>
<p>If the party changes its platform to attract new voters so that it CAN win, then clearly the members attachment to their original values was only one of convenience.  The GOP cannot prosper by making itself look more like the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The ugly truth that the legions of Rush Limbaugh and Hannity fans cannot bear to face, is that conservatism has been a huge failure.  It has not conserved ANY of the original core values of the people who spawned the movement.  On their watch, and during periods of unprecedented Republican control, we were treated to absolutely ENORMOUS and out-of-control spending, liberal policies, no roll-back of existing legislation.  Abortion, gun control, societal and moral decay, all continued apace.</p>
<p>Why did this happen?  Because the so-called &#8220;Conservative Republicans&#8221; were actually nothing more than Dollartarians, completely focused on economic matters and lining their nests with a few more bucks.  They were willing to let conservative values fall by the wayside, but boy oh boy did they spend a lot of time trying to lower taxes.</p>
<p>For those who have not encountered the term, a Dollartarian is someone who puts their own pocketbook ahead of the interests of their nation.  They will enact policy that is absolutely ruinous to their fellow Americans, simply to make a few more bucks.  Prime examples include businessmen who employ illegal aliens, politicians who hold open the immigration floodgates, etc.<br>

		<p>Jupiter @ post 81, There is another Evil that needs to be addressed as soon as possible by All White Nationalists, and that is the elimination of Abortion. </p>
<p>I personally stand against all Abortion, as the intentional murder of a developing Human Being. </p>
<p>Taking the Theology out of the discussion, this Nation is guilty of having allowed the murder of 50 million babies. Why? Because these babies were sentenced to Death, without the Due Process of Law, which the most Vile Criminal Murderer could not be denied.</p>
<p>Ted Bundy received a Fair Trial, and had several Appeals of his Death Penalty case, before he was Executed. But, who hears the Appeal for the Unborn Child? No one.</p>
<p>There is another reason why I brought this up, and it has to do with maintaining, or even increasing, the American White population over the next few years, if we can halt, or in some way deter, the destruction of unborn White children, today. </p>
<p>Let me be clear, I am opposed to all Abortion on Moral grounds, and my Religious convictions, but I will start where we have a chance of really reaching people, to make a positive impact for our Community, and as a first step to ending the incidious act of Abortion, entirely.</p>
<p>This should be an altuistic act on our part, which is to lend support to unwed White women, who feel that they don&rsquo;t have the money, or family support to raise their child. </p>
<p>It also addresses the struggling White family that may have two, or three children, but would contemplate Arbortion, because they can&rsquo;t afford more children. That&rsquo;s a reason not to get a dog, but certainly Not To Kill An Unborn Child. </p>
<p>I would recommend that White Nationalists create a Maternity Center for White women to learn to care for their Newborn, as well as receive donations of baby formula, bottles, a car seat, if needed, a stoller,diapers, baby toys, etc. </p>
<p>The same donations can be collected and delivered to White families, around the Country. Let these people know that they have a support system to rely on when things get really tough, and we can turn the tide against Abortion, in favor of healthy, happy White families.  </p>

		<p>The future of Western nations is one of ethno-based politics and parties.  </p>
<p>In the case of America, it will result in her break-up and the emergence of racial enclaves which, in time, through intermittent civil strife and internal warfare, will morph into separate independently-ruled regions and eventually, countries.  </p>
<p>Since the white American population is decreasing at the same time the global non-white demographics of America are relentlessly proliferating, it would be much more sensible for white Americans to commence looking at creating and supporting a white ethno-nationalist party to protect <i>THEIR</i> ethnic interests while it&rsquo;s still possible and which will recognise the &#8216;writing on the wall&rsquo;, and look at initiating plans for separate white ethnic states as a means of effecting the survival of white Americans.   </p>
<p>The GOP betrayed its Founding Fathers, the American Constitution and ultimately white America.  As a result of its treachery, it deserves to and ought to be killed off - permanently.<br>

<p>I would like it much better if the number of abortions was very low. But in the real world, woman are raped. A female member of my family-my mother- was threatrened with rape by a black male. There have been thousands of White Woman who have been raped by blacks. No doubt some of them became pregnant. If it were up to the antiabortionists these White Woman would be denied the legal right to abortion. And if they had an abortion, they would be guilty of first degree homicide which in some states carries  a death penalty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I believe if given a choice the anti-abortionists would elect the hindu Republican fake American Bobby Jindal and race-replacement enthusaist Sarah Palin. Rather than suppport a openly White Nationlaist candidate who supports the right to abortion.</p>
<p>I do not support the cop-out position of Thomas Fleming which is to let states decide the issue. This is a direct to the break-uo of America into sperate race-based nation states.</p>
<p>White Woman should not abort their feutuses if it is not the result of rape and incest. But I know of know other way to protect the hardship cases than to keep abortion legal. But keeping abortion legal doesn&rsquo;t mean that abortion couldn&rsquo;t be brought way down. I do not like abortion. But this is an issue where the complications of the real world are crucial for making sane and rational moral judgements.</p>

<p>When hasn&rsquo;t that been true with the Republican Party?  That&rsquo;s been it&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;etre ever since its first President, to repudiate the Founders and what America for the sake of a big government enforcing racial equality.</p>
<p>The natural party of the white Southerner is Democrat.  However, the only reason they vote Republican these days is because their own natural party kicked them out, to outpander the Republicans for black (and eventually Chicano) votes.  But white Southerners throwing in with the Party of Lincoln has always made as much sense as the Hitler-Stalin peace treaty, for almost the same reason, philosophically speaking.</p>
<p>Between the end of enemy military occupation of the South in 1876 and 1944, during the Presidential elections, there were some states that didn&rsquo;t have the Republican candidate on the ballot at all, they only had the Democrat, who got 100% of the vote.  Those that did, the Republican got only a few percent, from the few registered black voters.</p>
<p>Jupiter:  While I&rsquo;m not going to start another futile secessionist/10th Amendment fight with you, I do agree that the pro-life position won&rsquo;t take real hold (if it can at all) unless rape is added with incest and life of the mother as exceptions, for exactly the reasons you say.  As a matter of fact, the very concept of rape as an allowable reason to abort are, IMHO, just as much racial circumlocution codewords as many other things.  White women in big cities will get the message.</p>

<p>The debates that have taken place here about secession are not pointless. On the contrary, these debates raise very deep issues that have to be discussed. I hope there are many more debates about secession. American Renassaince is a much more interesting place to visit because there is much less censorship than other places such as Taki and Chronicles(where the same six people &#8220;debate&#8221; each other) I understand the secessionists&rsquo; motivation.</p>
