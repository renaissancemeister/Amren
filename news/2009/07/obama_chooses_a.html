<h1>Obama Chooses Ala Doctor As Next Surgeon General</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauran Neergaard, AP, July 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama turned to the Deep South for the next surgeon general, choosing a rural Alabama family physician who made headlines with fierce determination to rebuild her nonprofit medical clinic in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Dr. Regina Benjamin is known along Alabama&rsquo;s impoverished Gulf Coast as a country doctor who makes house calls and doesn&rsquo;t turn away patients who can&rsquo;t pay  &mdash;  even as she&rsquo;s had to find the money to rebuild a clinic repeatedly destroyed by hurricanes and once even fire.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Benjamin made headlines in the wake of Katrina, as photographs showed her laying patient charts out to bake in the sun and lamenting the lack of pricey but more hurricane-resistant electronic records. Her nonprofit clinic was rebuilt by volunteers only to burn down just as it was about to reopen. {snip}</p>

		<p>Dr Benjamin may be a fine physician, but I see no reason to think that she can manage a government department.  Or is the Surgeon General a figurehead?  If that&rsquo;s the case, I guess she&rsquo;ll do fine at putting out the Obama line on health care.  </p>

		<p>I imagine this one is on a par with Clinton&rsquo;s surgeon general, someone who comes across as so mentally challenged it makes people wonder how she completed high school, let alone med school, because of the nonsense that comes out of her mouth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not third world status yet, but as Gerald Celente says we are the first &#8220;undeveloped&#8221; nation.  Others in the West will follow, but we will lead the way to complete deterioration.</p>

		<p>She will fit right in w/obama&rsquo;s administration, there&rsquo;s a very good reason she has run that clinic off and on for years, no hospitals would hire her, only place she will be qualified to work is in obama&rsquo;s administration.</p>

		<p>Dr. Benjamin apparently wants to address illnesses that are preventable, like diabetes, which killed her father.  Now I have taken care of many patients with diabetes, mostly white, and 95% of them have been overweight.</p>
<p>If Dr. Benjamin wants to lead by example, well&hellip;she&rsquo;s got 40 lbs or so to lose for her country.</p>

		<p>Surgeon Generals need to be able to see the &#8220;Big Picture,&#8221;  and function at a high level.  As such, they need to have multiple skills and experiences such as in pandemics, statistics, financing, government regulation, public speaking, writing, lobbying, etc.  They should also have practical (&#8220;in-the-trenches&#8221;) experience, as well as research and publishing experience.  It helps if they have served as a Dean at a Medical Hospital or a Director of a Hospital.  </p>
<p>A &#8220;country doctor&#8221; has only practical experience, and is totally unsuited to the job.  It would be like selecting a &#8220;country-hunter&#8221; to head our Nations Military, because he has &#8220;experience&#8221; shooting squirrels. Of course Dr. Benjamin does have one very important accomplishment, and, in fact, the most important qualification to be selected by Obama   &mdash;   she has the correct skin color.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing.  Our economy is heading toward the abyss as the baby boomers start to retire.  Dr. Benjamin joins a host of other diverse faces as Obama and his lieutenants drive the bus off the cliff.   <br>

		<p>How does a 200-pound woman get a job as the Surgeon General? Not only does she look obese but her entire family reads like a list of medical nightmares from her father who died from diabetes and high blood pressure (two conditions usually manageable with diet and exercise, maybe with medication); her brother died of HIV, not surprising since 1 in 3 black males has a sexually transmitted disease; her mother died of lung cancer from smoking when she was young to be more like her brother (who is now on oxygen)&hellip; Please God make it stop.</p>

<p>It is conservatives who should be salivating with glee at the prospect of the destruction of America, not liberals. Liberals are parasites who are utterly dependent on the current system. When the system is destroyed, they will be destroyed along with it. </p>
<p>They finally have enough rope and now are about to hang themselves. </p>
