<h1>Miss D.C.: Washington, Without the Scandal</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Dufour and Kiki Ryan, Washington Examiner, July 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Sunday night&rsquo;s Miss D.C. pageant lacked that sort of drama. Recent American University graduate Jennifer Corey was crowned Miss D.C. 2009, and her win probably wasn&rsquo;t a shock to anyone in attendance at the Lincoln Theatre. Before the announcement of the new title-holder, Corey won the top award for outstanding talent, bathing suit competition and evening gown. </p>
<p>The tall, thin blonde will compete for the title of Miss America in January. She has big shoes to fill after last year&rsquo;s Miss D.C., Kate Marie Grinold (another tall, thin blonde) finished in the top 10.</p>

		<p>I suppose I&rsquo;m glad that a White will represent our Capital instead of a non-White, but I&rsquo;d prefer that no White women at all participated in this pimp show.  If she wants to clinch the Miss America title, she&rsquo;ll probably have to defile herself in some way.  Recall that last time, Miss California lost because she was asked if she supported homosexual &#8220;marriage&#8221;, and said No.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to be holding my breath until I learn more about her and her preferrences.  Of course, any hint of racial or ethnic pride will cause a fire-storm and lead to her disqualification.  But I hope she will represent White beauty and intelligence proudly, whatever the cost. </p>
<p>Oh yes, she is a knock-out.</p>

		<p>I hope you have a tough boyfriend my dear. The black aristocracy that runs DC and the hundreds of thousands of black &#8220;ladies&#8221; in DC will be highly displeased. Are these judges nuts? I suppose the decisive factor was the winner&rsquo;s ability to speak English (aside from her undeniable beauty). I am concerned about the young woman&rsquo;s safety however. After the national contest, I&rsquo;d leave DC if I were her.</p>

		<p>This one story right here is refreshing but I haven&rsquo;t seen enough positive change (the right kind of change) going on in the pageant industry for me to want to watch any of them anymore.</p>
<p>Beauty pageants have been taken over by the third world.  I am tired of seeing blonde Northern European countries putting up dark haired and dark skinned immigrants as their contestants.  This is not only obviously disturbing, but it is down right insulting.  Are they saying white women in Denmark and all these other places aren&rsquo;t as pretty as Asian/African/Latin American immigrants?</p>
<p>It is disturbing enough that we are falsely telling our people that third world Indians and such are smarter than whites and that is why we need them to do our brain work for us.  But for me it is even further over the top when we have to start outsourcing for beauty. I am so sick of this.</p>

		<p>I wonder if Miss DC had ever set foot in the District before she attended American University?</p>
<p>D.C., like many smaller jurisdictions with a weak pageant presence has long been a haven for transplants from Florida, Texas, and other pageant-crazy states. These &#8220;pageant pros&#8221; know that they&rsquo;ll be much more competitive against Washington, DC&rsquo;s &#8220;indigenous&#8221; population, then they would ever be against their peers in states where pageants are a cottage industry.</p>
<p>Why swim in a big pond full of pirranahs for the one ticket to the national competition, when there are plenty of smaller ponds filled with suckers, which offer the same ticket to nationals as the grand prize?</p>

		<p>She is unquestionably a very attractive young woman, and it is indeed odd that a place like Washington, DC would pick not one but two White women (and blondes to boot) back-to-back to represent them in the Miss America pageant.  I&rsquo;d like to see what the other contestants looked like.</p>
<p>That being said, however, the Miss America pageant is so irrelevant to modern America they can&rsquo;t even get network coverage anymore.  I can&rsquo;t help but notice that interest in the pageant started to wane after they rigged the contest so Vanessa &#8220;the Undressah&#8221; won in 1984.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering why the liberal press hasn&rsquo;t come out grinding her into the dirt, because they don&rsquo;t like whites to win anything.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin has wisely taken the fight to them on another front, so the radical leftist press calls her a quitter.</p>
<p>If she had stayed on as governor, they would have called for her to resign for some drummed up reason that&rsquo;s as phony as Obama&rsquo;s promises.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t be more right. Germany&rsquo;s next top model is an African now. And you are not alone, I&rsquo;m sick of it, too.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t there enough blond Germans or other Europeans to win?</p>
<p>Even 90% of non-Germans are of Turkish, Italian or Serbo-Croatian origin and they somehow managed to choose a dark skinned one. Could their decision be influenced by dumb Heidi Klum&rsquo;s black husband?</p>

		<p>NOTHING is more pleasing to the eye than a beautiful WHITE woman. This beauty I hope, is not a groveler and is proud of her race and their civilization and won&rsquo;t back down to the diversity pimps. </p>
<p>I too, like other posters, am sick and tired of all our European nations putting up some dark-skinned woman as their choice! WE all know why this is, don&rsquo;t we? Because Whites allow it and won&rsquo;t speak out and boycott their beauty pageants when this is the case.</p>
<p>BTW, isn&rsquo;t there a BLACK MISS USA pageant?  Why can&rsquo;t we have a MISS WHITE USA pageant? WE need to demand it!</p>

		<p>Actually, DC is becoming more white and less black.  Rising real estate prices and gentrification has pushed blacks out to Prince George&rsquo;s County and inner Montgomery county.  I would guess DC is about 55 % black, 33 % white, 10 % hispanic and 2 % asian.  </p>
<p>That a white woman would win Miss DC two years in a row may reflect that many of the judges were black males, who desperately desire white women almost to a man.  Ironically, a white is more likely to win Miss DC these days than play on the local NBA basketball team, the Wizards.</p>

		<p>Ironically, as DC is one of the few places in the country where whites are currently shoving blacks out   &mdash;   i.e., &#8220;gentrification&#8221;   &mdash;   this may be something of a trend. (I remember AmRen articles about San Francisco and parts of NYC where this is happening too.)</p>

		<p>Corey is a classice beauty of the type that the multicultural leftists denigrate daily, in favor of the false values that they push. For example, she doesn&rsquo;t need a &#8220;tan&#8221; to look good, she doesn&rsquo;t need a &#8220;tatoo&#8221; to be &#8220;hip&#8221;, and she doesn&rsquo;t really need to wear a &#8220;wild animal pattern type dress&#8221;, to be sexy.</p>

		<p>As a native to the DC-MD region I can testify to the beauty of North-West DC. Between the embassies (which are all in NW), the Universities (Georgetown, American and George Washington), and of course all the various service industries that have grown out of the federal government, NW DC is a beautiful place full of gardens and a mix of late Victorian and Neo-Classical architecture. These homes are full of bureaucrats and professors who espouse diversity but of course live far away from the diverse neighborhoods. A normal sized single family home on a quarter acre lot in NW can probably sell for well over $750,000, well out of the reach of most &#8216;diverse&rsquo; home buyers.<br>
As soon as you cross to the eastern side of Rock Creek Park the city becomes much more diverse. By the time you get to the east of North Capitol St. (the dividing line down the center of the city) those same Victorian homes are dilapidated ruins inhabited by the same listless blacks we find in every major US city. What should be gorgeous parks are splotches of unkempt natural growth inhabited by bums, drug dealers and junkies. The wide avenues modeled after those in Paris are full of trash and bums instead of cafe&rsquo;s. The National Arboretum is a spectacular collection of plants from around the world, but in order to get there you have to traverse neighborhoods that more resemble Soweto or Port-au-prince than anything one finds in the West.<br>
This beautiful woman clearly represents the North-West and not the rest of the asphalt scar we call Washington.</p>
