		<p>I dunno. It seems the moral of the story is that one should not be exclusionary lest others exclude you (give you a taste of your own medicine). In the end the dragon repented of his racism. Doesn&rsquo;t really work for me.</p>

		<p>*Albi the Racist Dragon Meets Godzilla.*</p>
<p>Albi: &ldquo;Go away Godzilla, I just ate a barbequed Albanian boy and have reverted back to my racist ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godzilla: &ldquo;Well, what do you have against me; I am a monster myself and a dragon of sorts also, so what gives? He, he, he…plus, I am racist too; I fry whole Japanese cities full of those little sushi eaters and make yakitori for myself just to tick Rodan off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albi: &ldquo;Not bad, but that is not my point, you are still a Japanese monster and I only like Western Monsters, like King Kong or Nessi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godzilla: &ldquo;Albi, you really are an ignorant racist. Don&rsquo;t you know that it was the Americans&rsquo; atomic bomb tests that made me? I am not just a white monster, I have the &lsquo;made in America&rsquo; stamp of authenticity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albi: &ldquo;Big deal, when was the last time you had a German Frankenburger or a New York King Kong Dong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godzilla: &ldquo;Why you dirty SOB, you know that bastard King Kong cheats when he fights….GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUMMMMGGGRRRRUMP….&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvRJa0aR3qY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvRJa0aR3qY</a></p>
<p>And thus, from New Zeeland to Tokyo &ldquo;cultural misunderstands&rdquo; took on a whole new meaning; when the battle was over, several universities undertook a study of atomic monsters and dragons to determine that both were equal in abilities. An interesting finding that cannot be explained fully, did prove that atomic monsters do have &ldquo;equality limits&rdquo; when compared with dragons, when the issue of anger management is considered as a variable.</p>
<p>Jellybeans or Gumdrops anybody?</p>

		<p>I must admit, I too was confused about what they were trying to say. If the villagers were anti-racist, why did they chase the Albanian boy there? It&rsquo;s just all a bit strange. </p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to finish watching the video it was so silly.</p>
<p>The entire Western world is fixated on anything racial, because whites have been conditioned so greatly.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say much for their intelligence really.  So sad.</p>
<p>Concentration on anti-racism is an absolute waste of time, and those who are wrapped up in it are foolish dupes.</p>

		<p> I believe that these two are being deliberately ambiguous.  We, as Amren readers, are naturally searching for the underlying ideology, which they are purposely blurring.  At least it is a slight improvement from the usual &#8220;white people are so bad&#8221; jokes.  </p>
<p> Can you blame them for using race jokes?  Many audience members were laughing as soon as they heard the word &#8220;racist&#8221;.  You can always expect entertainers, and perhaps especially comedians, to use cultural taboos in their material, for their livelihood depends on it.  </p>

<p>I agree. Although they appear to be sincerely &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo;, this does sound like they&rsquo;re mocking the anti-racist lessons they learned in grade school. So while I think they accepted the message, they&rsquo;re taking a jab at the indoctrination. Without knowing them personally and their political leanings, it&rsquo;s difficult to know what the joke is, racists, indoctinating children, or both. <br/>

		<p>Every year that my kids were in elementary school, they had to sit through 1/2 day programs about &#8220;hate&#8221; that featured songs and plays very similar to this one.  Even at 8 years of age, my kids were laughing and making fun of such stupid propaganda.  Today, at Thanksgiving and Christmas we will still all burst out laughing when someone yells, &#8220;Stop the hate.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s turned into a family joke.</p>

		<p>I thought this was funny and clever.</p>
<p>It is a parody of overly preachy Lefty folk songs.</p>
<p>Humor is a great weapon for us as PC multi Cult types have no sense of humor. They are a new form of puritanism - a cult of humorless conformity - where those who aren&rsquo;t PC are in league with the Devil.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be a bit devilish and use humor as a weapon. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to guess that the audience was laughing because for once they could hear the &#8220;word&#8221; racist, and not have to put on the prescribed frown.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not really a fan of these guys myself, but I was quite heartened to hear that with all their instant fame (within their cult college kids niche.)<br/>
That they stayed true and married their longtime girlfriends (high school sweetheart in one case).<br/>
