<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?nid=600&amp;sid=1713904">Kaine to Update Effort to Collect Info. on Black Virginians</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Tim Kaine is set to update Virginia&rsquo;s first-in-the-nation initiative to electronically compile the records of black Virginians whose family history was smudged by slavery and racism.</p>
<p>The Virginia Freedmen Project has collected microfilm from the National Archives and digitized them to make genealogical records more accessible to African-American families.</p>
<p>Kaine will make an announcement Thursday on the initiative at the Black History Museum and Cultural Center in Richmond. The center has worked with volunteers in the labor-intensive task of taking the National Archives materials and making them available electronically.</p>
<p>Many black Virginians struggle to trace their family tree because of the legacy of slavery.<br>

		<p>Does Gov. Tim Kaine, King of the Klingons, really want to honor black Virginians?  If so, then he should restore Virginia&rsquo;s &#8220;retired&#8221; state song, &#8220;Carry Me Back To Ole Virginney,&#8221; the only American state song written by a black person.</p>

		<p>Not a shot, but I would be inordinately surprised if most black Virginians could name their immediate ancestors, much less anyone who lived over one hundred years ago. </p>

		<p>When Gov. Kaine grew up in Overland Park, KS it was 98% white.  He has no first hand experience going to school with and seeing how violent and uneducated blacks are.  He is just playing the game to keep black voters happy.</p>

		<p>Given the current rate of black illegitimacy (now 80%), it would be extremely difficult for the great majority of American blacks to establish their lineage beyond their birth mothers.</p>
<p>Yet another tragic legacy of slavery!</p>

		<p>Kaine grew up in OPKS?  That explains everything.  OPKS is classic white flight territory.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia (and therefore subject to further corroboration), he was born in St. Paul, MN and graduated from KC Rockhurst HS.  The thing about Rockhurst is that it&rsquo;s right along State Line Road in KC on the Missouri side.  I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but I think you can&rsquo;t go to that HS if you live in Kansas, b/c of the KC Archdiocese&rsquo;s boundaries.</p>

		<p>Johnson County is full of liberal ex-KC residents, who were freaked out when their Brookside/Plaza neighbors were getting mugged in their driveways as they were coming home from work and drive-by shootings were occurring three blocks away. So they moved to conservative, lily white JoCo, where the grass was supposed to be greener. They may have abandoned their MO citizenship but they didn&rsquo;t abandon their MO voting patterns. <br>
I&rsquo;ve read posts from disgruntled Coloradans about their state being invaded by clueless Californians fleeing a once beautiful state wrecked by disastrous policies by their ELECTED officials.<br>
The problem is that Kansas is a sparsely populated state and that JoCo is by a considerable margin, the most populated county in Kansas. It holds considerable sway in statewide elections and liberal to moderate Democrats and Republicans usually prevail. There has always been a rivalry between KS and MO, but this is one instance where the Kansans are right about how worthless Missouri is.</p>

		<p>This genealogical records not only better be &#8216;accessible to blacks&rsquo;  but the better be &#8216;accessible to blacks&rsquo; free of charge or else the Gov. will be accused of &#8216;disenfranchising the poor and minorities&rsquo;. No one knows exactly what &#8216;disenfranchising&rsquo; means, but it&rsquo;s a big word and always sounds like a powerful, ominous threat when used by blacks.</p>

		<p>I always become amazed when the minorities start babbling on and on about slavery,forty years after the US civil war ended, North African slavers were still raiding the coasts of Spain Ireland England France and Holland for slaves, mainly women as sex playthings in their harems.Do we go on and on about how these Barbary pirates sunk nearly two hundred British ships in one year in their quest for slaves ? No of course not, but then again we are white.</p>

<p>While North African slavers undoubtedly raided these countries 300 years ago, any Barbary pirate trying it 40 years after the American Civil War would have quickly found themselves on the receiving end of a touch of &#8220;gunboat diplomacy&#8221;. </p>

		<p>This whole issue is getting pretty old and stale right now. Now we have the president running arould the world whining about slavery and making us the laughing stock of the world. All the dignity has left that office.</p>

		<p>- Since all Afro-americans have some degree of White ancestry, they are also responsable, no? And, since 30% of White Southerners have Black admixture (1-2%) they also deserve some compensation&hellip;<br>
- Mr. Joe, native North-africans are Caucasians that belong to the same racial group than south Europeans(Mediterranics). And are not already a problem in second half of 19 century. Not even in Portugal, Spain or Italy (much less in Holland or England). But your point is right. If we ask compensations for everything in the past, will be funny&hellip; Russians from Mongols, Balcanics from Turks, Arabs from Jews&hellip; <br>

<p>Obama compares America&rsquo;s brief experience with slavery to the Holocaust.  This is akin to comparing a hangnail to the radical amputation of a limb.  </p>
<p>Obama refuses to acknowledge the fact that the enslavement of blacks by other blacks predates America&rsquo;s brief experience with slavery by thousands of years. <br>

Obama refuses to acknowledge the fact that the enslavement of blacks by Arabs predates America&rsquo;s brief experience with slavery by thousands of years.  <br>
 <br>
Obama also refuses to acknowledge the fact that the enslavement of blacks by other blacks continues unabated in sub-Saharan Africa to this very day&hellip;.     <br>

		<p>Blacks can&rsquo;t trace their family tree because of slavery?</p>
<p>My mistake.</p>
<p>I thought it was because of women having children with multiple partners.</p>
