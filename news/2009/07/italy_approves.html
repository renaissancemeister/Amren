<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31709378/">Italy Approves Anti-Immigration Bill</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, July 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tough new measures to fight illegal immigration and crime became law in Italy Thursday after the Senate gave the green light to a bill contested by the center-left opposition and the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The law makes illegal immigration a crime punishable with a fine of up to 10,000 euros ($14,000) and raises to six months the amount of time that illegal migrants can be detained in holding centers before repatriation.</p>
<p>It also allows the creation of unarmed citizen patrols to help police and soldiers fight crime on the streets, makes it a jail offence to force children to beg, a measure viewed as targeting gypsies and Roma people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a heated debate at the Senate, center-left lawmakers accused the government of violating the rights of immigrants and said the citizen patrols risked becoming vigilante groups taking the law into their hands.</p>

		<p>This could be a good thing.  Unfortunately, politics being what it is in Italy, if the current right-of-center coalition is forced from office, this law will invariably follow it.  There&rsquo;s also the question of how well this law will be enforced now.  Many laws on the books in this country are hardly (or selectively) enforced.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also allows the creation of unarmed citizen patrols to help police and soldiers fight crime on the streets, makes it a jail offence to force children to beg, a measure viewed as targeting gypsies and Roma people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another in a long list of proofs of the colossal level of ignorance found among msm journalists.  &#8220;Roma people&#8221; are gypsies.  To say &#8220;gypsies and Roma people&#8221; is a silly redundancy.</p>

		<p>Bravom Italy.  The only European country that is at least trying to do something about the third world hordes and the crimes they cause.</p>
<p>If they could swing it, they should put their leftist dregs right in with the restless natives to see how much they want to cater to third world crime and poverty.</p>

		<p>Time to move to Italy and become a &#8220;vigilante&#8221;. At least the Senate in that counrty gets it right, stick up for your citizens first, not the &#8220;rights&#8221; of immigrants..</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see: $14,000 x 20,000,000 illegals in the USA.  Why, that comes to $280 Billion!!!  Not a bad down payment on our National debt.  We would also eliminate additional Billions of Dollars in education, policing, medical and social costs to maintain these foreigners.  It would immediately reduce auto traffic in L.A., Miami, Chicago, and reduce America&rsquo;s energy, clean water, land-fill and air pollution crisis.  The best thing is that sending the 20 million illegals home would immediately create millions of jobs for unemployed American citizens.  This would also instantly produce 20 million new foreign consumers who would buy our products, reducing our trade deficit.  What a bargain. The Italians are geniuses.</p>

		<p>THIS GREAT NEWS MADE MY DAY.</p>
<p>Finally, civilization is rising.  A hallmark if civilization is love and desire for safety and preservation for your own self, your own family, race and nation.  This is culture.  It opposite, alienism, is barbarianism.</p>
<p>So I am glad Italians are doing the right think and getting rid of the alien invaders.  </p>
<p>I am ashamed the Catholic Church is still an alienist.  The  Church must lead us to culture.  Shame on the catholic church for its barbaric alienist views.<br>

<p>When people feel helpless that the government is not doing enough to rid their neighborhood, country, society of undesireable elements, then sometimes vigilantiism starts to look like a pretty good option, if not the only one.</p>

		<p>I have read about this law at the Council of Conservative Citizens, a few days ago, and also read here about the forming of Civilian Patrols in Italy. Bravo, Italia!</p>
<p>We already have the Minutemen Civil Defense Corp. on the Mexican and Northern Borders. What they need is to be Deputized as Border Agents, to assist in making arrests of Border crossers in their State.  </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a Catholic you better start paying attention to the Catholic church&rsquo;s pandering to and accomodation of muslims..Muslims WILL NOT TOLERATE CATHOLICS IN A MUSLIM  WORLD!! what is it about that statement the Catholics and other Christians don&rsquo;t understand?</p>

		<p>This kind of thinking can happen in Italy more easily than here because of the abundance of cultural reminders of the greatness of Italian culture, which of course preceded Catholicism. It is difficult to orate about the great untapped resource Africans will make to Italy with the Colosseum as a backdrop. Maybe some African dwellings of comparative antiquity on display would convince, however.<br>

<p>They&rsquo;ll just go ahead and say that they built the Colosseum, in the days when Julius Caesar looked like Denzel Washington and Ceasar Augustus looked like Samuel L. Jackson.</p>

		<p>Skip, I&rsquo;m Catholic, and I WON&rsquo;T TOLERTATE MUSLIMS IN A CATHOLIC WORLD. It was the Catholic Church that called for the Holy Crusades against the Muslims, Ceturies ago. It can, and probably will, happen again.</p>
<p>Catholics are fed up with Muslims. So are Eathern Orthodox Christians. Talk to any Greek, or Serbian, and see how they feel about Muslims. Just don&rsquo;t stand near anything breakable.</p>

<p>That (unfortunately) is just YOU.  It obviously does not speak for the official position of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Yes, the Church once called for crusades   &mdash;   a thousand years ago. But it&rsquo;s also obvious that the Catholic Church has changed. Especially since Vatican II, it has been infiltrated and taken over by another ideology, just as Europe&rsquo;s governments have been; and today&rsquo;s church is not the same as what it once was.<br>

		<p>The Defense from that infiltration of the Holy Mother Church is what the Legion of St. Louis, the Society of Pope Pius X, and the Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, or TFP, are engaged in. </p>
<p>These are Traditional, Latin Rite based, Catholic Societies, with a desire to return the Church to a pre-Vatican II state. </p>
<p>The desire among many of the Faithful to return to Our More Traditional Latin Mass, has Latin Mass attendance up, in every Parish that offers it. </p>
<p>Also, the study of the Latin Language is also increasing. Just as the Greek language is center to the Liturgy of the Greek Orthodox Church, so too, is Latin, in the Catholic Church. <br>
