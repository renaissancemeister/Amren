<h1>India Girls Plough Fields to Bring Rain: Naked Ritual</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"Jeanette," Right Bollywood, July 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>India girls plough fields to bring rain to their parched fields, naked no less, in a ritual that is said to &#8220;embarrass the weather gods&#8221; to bring rain.</p>
<p>Farmers in Bihar have taken to their unmarried daughters and asked that they go naked and plough the fields to bring rain while chanting hymns after sunset.</p>
<p>&#8220;They (villagers) believe their acts would get the weather gods badly embarrassed, who in turn would ensure bumper crops by sending rains.&#8221;</p>
<p>So as the India girls plough fields to bring rain (naked), they will continue to do so until it &#8220;rains very heavily&#8221;.</p>
<p>The fields in Bihar are in dire need of the moisture, and this is the worst start of the monsoon season in over 80 years. Just two years ago, Bihar was badly affected by monsoon rains, causing flooding and leaving hundreds homeless.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised there are any girls left in India.</p>
<p>Bihar and Andhra Pradesh are said to be the most deluded states in India. Andhra Pradesh also has the highest concentration of Brahmins. Next time some Indian lectures you about contrived white racism remind him of how his co-ethnics treat dalits, women and foreigners(white women in India.)</p>

		<p>I work with many East Indian engineers. Some have heavy British accents. Most have degrees in computer science or electrical engineering from top American universities.</p>
<p>They tend to be very arrogant, constantly commenting that American public schools are lax compared to India and Americans are too lazy to get into engineering graduate schools.</p>
<p>When they get like this I will ask questions such a &#8220;How can the elite Indian school system deny 400 million people basic reading skills, leaving them in abject poverty?&#8221;</p>
<p>They always say that my numbers are wrong&hellip;so I revise my statement. &#8220;OK you&rsquo;re right only 300 million are illiterate.&#8221; They usually agree and I say &#8220;with the population of the US at 300 million, India has the same number of people who can&rsquo;t even read a math book, that is terrrible!&#8221; At this point they leave my presence shaking their heads.</p>
<p>Of course he ultimate proof of India&rsquo;s failure as a society is the fact that so many of their ELITES are scratching and clawing to get an H1B and come to America&hellip;with its lax school system and lazy students.<br>

<p>Yes, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s a lot more to the story than that.</p>
<p>For example I expect that there&rsquo;s a fairly large audience of males hiding in the foilage along the fields getting quite an eyeful as the girls are plowing, thinking about how clever their male ancestors were to create this myth in the first place.</p>

		<p>Is it not funny? It used to be that the foreign nationals who came into someones nation, needed to be educated to the culture of that nation, not the ohter way around. It was called assimilation.</p>

		<p>Thomas Jackson,</p>
<p>I have been around Indians who act that way also.  In recent years I have come up with an argument that points out how silly their claims are.</p>
<p>Even though I don&rsquo;t encourage it, the reason why white kids can be spoiled and lazy is because their ancestors toiled and toiled creating the great modern societies they live in today.  </p>
<p>Right now, the Indians are trying to play catch up.  So of course their students who they send to the U.S. are mostly going to be focused on mathematics and engineering.  They need to learn those things in order to catch up with us.  Their country is a dump right now, so they have to learn about OUR science and math (yes it IS OURS ) in order to get anywhere.</p>
<p>While I am not encouraging American kids to be lazy, I think this right here is a very thought provoking point, and it is something so very obvious that, for Indians to come up to me hatefully and arrogantly bragging about how most engineering students in American colleges are Indian, they are exposing their own folly and stupidity on the matter.  </p>
<p>How dare they even for one minute assume that all this means that their people are more brilliant than ours.  Give me a break.</p>

<p>Of course, in due time, the monsoon will arrive and it will start to rain.   This will &#8220;prove&#8221; that the tactic was a succesful one after all.</p>
<p>Ah! Such is the Third World mentality.  And we are eager to bring more of these people, with their wonderful customs, here!!!</p>

<p>Arab/Iranian immigrants are the same way. Very proud, off-hand remarks about the laziness of Americans. Most swarthy people from this region from the world are both chunky and boisterous, so its probably innate.</p>
<p>Silver lining. If so many of India&rsquo;s students are literate they are therefore eligible for the Trends in International Math and Science study(TIMSS). This will give us a more accurate picture of how good/bad a country&rsquo;s education/IQ is.  </p>
<p>I got tired of an Iranian co-workers bad mouthing American kids and emailed him a link ranking countries by performance on these sort of tests. Shut him up. I think this will quiet Indians too.</p>

It is a very annoying assumption of many of those who are newly arrived that they think America sprang into being the day before they stepped off the plane.  Before that, they assume there was nothing here but wilderness. </p>
<p>All they know is what they see here RIGHT NOW.  Well, surprise to them, the USA wasn&rsquo;t built yesterday. We&rsquo;ve been around for quite a while. I&rsquo;m speaking of generations.  Who do they think filled those classrooms (and founded those colleges) before they arrived?  Yes, those classes (and businesses, and hospitals, etc.) were once all filled with &#8220;lazy&#8221;  Americans who built them and staffed them quite competently, all by themselves, without needing any foreign help to run the show.</p>

		<p>Some good points about India and other countries. The arrogance and disrespect of some of these people is amazing. I&rsquo;ve always been told that when you go to another country and they allow you the priveledge of being let in, you respect that country as a guest by not openly criticizing it. It is very rude and disrepectful for them to come to OUR country and criticize it. Furthermore, they know nothing about our educational system  except our universities, which they attend frequently. Also, on average, Americans are some of the hardest working people on earth, next to the Japanese. Look how little vacation we get. If their countries are so great, than why don&rsquo;t they stay home. If their country were better, they wouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>

		<p>In the Hindu Indian Religion, women who were Widowed had to throw themselves onto the cremation fires that were burning their Husbands&rsquo; bodies. </p>
<p>The women were thought of having nothing to live for, after their Husbands died, and had to die, as well.</p>
<p>The British Viceroy banned the practice. </p>

		<p>You are missing the genius of all this.  Under new legislation to allow abused women asylum in the US, these naked girls have a welcoming committee here waiting for them.  And of course they wouldn&rsquo;t be deprived of their family members company.  Perhaps the Feds can provide a bit of stimulus money to pay their fares, house them, and feed them.  Indigent medical care here is free as well.  If you we an improverished third-worlder, wouldn&rsquo;t you send you daughters out to plow the field naked for that deal?</p>

		<p>The well-trained Third Worlders who come here are the elites of their own countries, and they despise their own lower class countrymen as much as they do Americans.  Think about it, some Brahmin comes here, do you think he&rsquo;s going to hold an American farmer in any higher esteem that the farmers in his own country?  These people come from an ancient culture that tells them that the first thing to know about another person is their line of work/social status.  Hindus in particular have to sort us out, place us in what they imagine is the right category, and treat us accordingly.  The change that comes over a Hindu when they learn that the man in working clothes is a schoolteacher is remarkable.</p>

<p>I think you are in the minority though. Western men in general find these dusky daughters of the East delightfully enticing precisely because they are timid, small and submissive.   The feminist revolution has redefined Western womanhood to such a great extent that feminine qualities are almost seen as signs of weakness and self-hatred among white women. </p>

<p>I dare say that their docility and timidity has a lot to do with brutality and cruelty of Indian men. There are plentifull horror stories happening in Indian communities all over the western countries.Take a while to google it, if you will. Living in such violent, patriarchal societies will break even the strongest of women. The few that manage to pull out of the animalistic grip of indian men will end up on the front pages of newspapers. Before you express your disgust at their qualities, please take a look at the big picture.</p>

     Let me guess, are you Persian by any chance?<br>
     The fact is India&rsquo;s Aryans were Indians only and <br>
     they did not come from Iran as you are claiming.  </p>
<p>     It was the Indo-European speaking Indian Aryans<br>
     who invaded Iran and Indo-Europeanized the Iranian<br>
     natives of the plateau.   There is nothing in common<br>
     between Indians and Iranians whether genetically or<br>
     culturally.   </p>
<p>     Indians are a fundamentally different people from <br>
     Middle-Easterners.  They are not the same at all.   <br>

Deva, the Dravidians possessed a Harrapan culture for thousands of years before your Russian/Scandianvian/Middle European ancestors came down the Kush, so I doubt they were from North India, or they would have been Dravidian.</p>
<p>Like most of the Aryanized mixed-bloods of North India, Deva has to tout Indian Nationalism because his Caucausoid type is a tiny minority in India.</p>
