<h1><a href="https://thehill.com/leading-the-news/gop-holder-battle-over-new-black-panthers-2009-07-12.html">GOP, Holder Battle Over New Black Panthers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Molly K. Hooper, The Hill, July 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) said Holder has ignored at least three letters sent over the past month from Republicans demanding to know why Justice dismissed charges of voter intimidation filed against two members of the &#8220;New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense&#8221; (NBPP).</p>
<p>NBPP National Chairman Milik Zulu Shabazz and party member Jerry Jackson both faces charges for violating the Voting Rights Act for engaging in coercion, threats and intimidation and attempted coercion, threats, and intimidation of voters and those aiding voters at a Philadelphia polling station on November 4th, 2008.</p>
<p>Charges against the Black Panthers were originally filed when President George W. Bush was in power.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Justice said facts did not back up the charges, and that career officials at Justice, not political appointees, decided to drop the charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holder let stand one of the four original charges though. The leader of the black nationalist group&rsquo;s Philadelphia chapter, Minister King Samir Shabazz, is charged with brandishing a &#8220;deadly weapon,&#8221; a nightstick, outside of the polls.</p>
<p>As a result, he was punished with not being able to brandish a weapon within 100 ft. of a polling station in Philadelphia until after the 2012 elections.</p>
<p>Wolf, ranking member of the House Judiciary subcommittee that funds Justice, has called on Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers (D-Mich.) to hold a hearing into the matter. He said one of the Black Panther members was allegedly carrying a local Democratic committee card.</p>
<p>In a letter to Conyers, Wolf wrote that Justice&rsquo;s inaction &#8216;merits congressional attention, if only to force the department to explain its decision to dismiss this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He noted that Conyers held 70-hearings on the political firings of several U.S. Attorneys under former Bush.</p>
<p>Conyers has not ruled out holding an investigative hearing but wants to take the situation &#8220;one-step at a time,&#8221; Democratic committee sources said.</p>
<p>These sources said Conyers told Holder to respond to the GOP request for answers after speaking with Wolf about the matter on Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to an affidavit filed by veteran voting rights activist Bartle Bull, who monitored elections in Mississippi at the height of the civil rights movement, the New Black Panther&rsquo;s directed racist comments towards white poll workers such as &#8220;you are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rep. Robert Brady (D-Pa.) says those charges are &#8220;bull.&#8221;</p>
<p>The congressman, who also chairs the Philadelphia Democratic Party, said he went to the polling station on election day last year after hearing about reports of threatening behavior, but found no evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&rsquo;t intimidating anybody, they didn&rsquo;t try to suppress any votes,&#8221; said Brady.</p>

		<p>This is blatant bias favoring black criminals.  Too bad we don&rsquo;t have any talk show hosts with enough guts to bring this topic up for discussion.</p>
<p>People all the time on here are constantly asking why whites don&rsquo;t get up and take action themselves.  Well, here&rsquo;s the reason.  These kinds of racial incidents are not aired by our side.  If they&rsquo;re not aired, they&rsquo;re known only to a few aware people.</p>
<p>A few talk show hosts&hellip;..Rush Limbaugh in particular&hellip;.. are now finally talking about the double standard given to this Sotomayor for saying racist things a white would be ruined for, and race IS being talked about more.  That wasn&rsquo;t the case BEFORE the messiah came to power.  The opening to discuss anti-white racial issues has arisen because of him in some way or another.  His nomination of an anti-white mestizo hater brought this about right now.</p>
<p>Will the debate continue or will it be dropped the way it always has been, like a hot potato?</p>
<p>We need a REALLY outrageous anti-white happening to keep the conversation going until black racism is talked about as commonly as white racism.  If that ever occurs, look for a large percentage of whites to sound off on the subject.  </p>
<p>The most devastating thing that could EVER happen to blacks is that it became common for the truth to be openly discussed about them, with instances highlighted as to their criminal conduct and anti-white hatred.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s ok for me and my white friend to stand at the entrance of a polling place wearing black pseudo-uniforms while displaying a truncheon?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try that during the next presidential election. I&rsquo;ll tell you how it works out.<br>

		<p>We must find a term for whites like Rep. Robert Brady that will equal the black term uncle Tom. I suggest that whites like Brady are real Father Pflegers. Yeah, that Brady is nothing but a Father Pfleger.</p>

		<p>Bob Brady is a thug.  THUG.  T-H-U-G and he is the leader of thugs.  Asking his opinion of the New Black Panther Party is like asking a Nazi his opinion of the SS.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the video on AmRen before. It wasn&rsquo;t voter intimidation. It is moving closer, however, to elections in Africa, where, actually, they don&rsquo;t normally have elections. <br>

<p>How about Uncle Tom?  That way you don&rsquo;t have to explain it, and it stings (unlike &#8220;race-traitor&#8221; which race traitors take as a compliment).</p>
<p>Whites aren&rsquo;t allowed to call blacks Uncle Toms anyway so we might as well get some mileage out of the term what way we can.</p>

		<p>I find it hard to believe this.  Have the Republicans actually grown some stones?  We can only wish.  I&rsquo;ll believe it if they all vote against the apppointment of Sotomayer to the Supreme Court.  A member of La Raza on the Supreme Court may just be the final death blow to America.</p>

		<p>Funny how the mere presence of a cop within sight of a polling place is called &#8220;voter intimidation&#8221; by the Party, but the threatening presence of black thugs physically blocking the entrance to white voters is quite OK.</p>
<p>Blacks have in fact become a privileged class in America, a strange status for a criminal element that commits the overwhelming majority of violent crime in this country.</p>
