	<p><b>Racism Indian Style</b></p>
<p>* A Madurai sessions court sentences Farook Batcha to two years&rsquo; RI in 2008 for harassing his wife so much about being dark that it drove her to suicide.</p>
<p>* In 2007, IPL authorities allegedly asked two black cheerleaders of the King&rsquo;s XI Punjab team to go back home</p>
<p>* The information and broadcasting ministry issues a notice to Nimbus Communications for a racist ad during the 2007 India-West Indies series. The promo featured a West Indian running around for water after eating spicy food. No Indian comes to his help. The ad&rsquo;s punchline: &#8220;It&rsquo;s tough being a West Indian in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>* Bilyaminu Ibrahim, a Nigerian student at an engineering college in Greater Noida, is spat at by one of his Indian seniors.</p>
<p>* Robert, a Kenyan student in Pune, is denied entrance to a pub. He is asked to return on Tuesday for an &#8220;all-black&#8221; night.</p>
<p>* In May this year, a group of Iraqi students is attacked by a mob of 150 in Greater Noida. Three of the students are grievously injured and hospitalised.</p>
<p>* The Delhi Police issues guidelines in 2007 to students from the Northeast. Tips include a strict no to &#8220;revealing dresses&#8221; and curbing traditional food with an alien aroma like &#8220;bamboo shoots&#8221; which offends neighbours.</p>
<p>* A controversial ad for Fair &amp; Lovely cream features a father who is unhappy because his daughter is dark and unsuccessful. The cream changes her complexion and lands her a glamorous job.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Humiliation for Yoyce Jones, a Black American fresh out of an Ivy League college, came bang in the middle of Delhi&rsquo;s booming satellite town Gurgaon. He was at a chemist&rsquo;s in one of its glittering malls to buy some face soap. The man at the counter handed him a fairness soap instead. Jones clarified what exactly he wanted but the man insisted on giving him that same product. That&rsquo;s what really raised Jones&rsquo;s hackles. &#8220;I thanked him for his fairness soap and told him that I was proud of my skin colour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ask any African what it is like for him or her to be in India and you might perhaps think twice before calling Australia racist. It is indeed a very dark underbelly that India reveals when it comes to its treatment of the dark foreigner. Africans being called &#8220;kalia&#8221; or &#8220;habshi&#8221; is mild stuff. Bilyaminu Ibrahim, a Nigerian student at an engineering institute in Greater Noida, will tell you what it feels like to be spat on. Abdulmalik Ali Abdulmalik, another Nigerian student, will recount how much it hurts when one&rsquo;s beaten with cricket bats and wickets over a simple game. Across the country, landlords slam doors when they see a prospective African tenant but drool for money when a white walks in. Foreigners&rsquo; Registration Offices cancel the visas of Africans arbitrarily and make paperwork easier for Americans and Europeans. Why, even in the film Fashion, Priyanka Chopra thinks she has hit rock-bottom because she finds herself sleeping with an African!</p>
<p>Of course, the Indian prejudice against the &#8220;shyam varna&#8221; is as old as Hindu mythology itself. &#8220;When Krishna literally means dark,&#8221; says Mumbai-based mythology expert Devdutt Pattanaik, &#8220;why is he always portrayed in blue rather than in natural black?&#8221; Comics and TV serials routinely depict evil (the demons) as dark and good (the gods) as fair. &#8220;It just reinforces our prejudices,&#8221; says Pattanaik.</p>
<p>The south Indian has long become accustomed to the northerner using the term &#8216;Madrasi&rsquo; as almost a pejorative for his darker skin tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a certain dominance of north Indian aesthetics,&#8221; says Delhi-based sociologist Patricia Uberoi, &#8220;where feminine beauty values a fair skin contrasted with dark hair and combined with soft features and big eyes. This goes with the global aspect where Indians are being exposed to international television that celebrates East Asian beauty with fair skin and dark hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, while the South may decry this attitude of the northerners, it is as guilty of placing a huge premium on fairness.</p>
<p>Tamil cinema, in fact, is known for reinforcing the stigma against dark skin. Superhero Rajnikanth himself may be dark, but fair women all the way from Rajasthan are imported to star in Tamil films.</p>
<p>Indian advertising too for long has courted fairness. You will never find a dark woman or man selling you a cosmetic brand in the Indian media. Or for that matter anything. After all, who can look better than a John Abraham peddling Garnier&rsquo;s new fairness cream? And in case you were beginning to forget the importance of fairness, Vogue India reminded us of it blatantly with its inaugural cover in October 2007. It flashed pale Australian model Gemma Ward as its centrepiece with the relatively darker Indian beauties Bipasha Basu and Priyanka Chopra as her sidekicks.</p>
<p>Matrimonial ads, week after week, hammer this in unfailingly: dark is ugly, fair is lovely. The dark can sit on the marriage shelf, there is demand only for the fair or very fair. And it is not uncommon to find dark men marrying into poor families just so that they may have a fair bride.</p>
<p>Sometimes this obsession with fair skin can be fatal. Like in the tragic 2008 incident, when a woman was driven to suicide after her husband constantly harassed her for being dark. The Madurai sessions court sentenced Farook Batcha, the husband, to rigorous imprisonment for two years. The judgement was later upheld by the Madras High Court and the Supreme Court following an appeal by Batcha that calling one&rsquo;s wife dark did not amount to torture.</p>
<p>Doctor V.K. Sharma, president of the Indian Association of Dermatologists, Venereologists and Leprologists (IADVL), points to a harmful turn that the obsession with fair skin has taken. Across urban and rural India, illiterate and unaware women aspiring to be fair are being sold Betnovate, a skin steroid cream, to lighten their skin. Meant for certain skin rashes and inflammations, a fairer shade of skin is only its &#8220;side-effect&#8221;. But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped this prescription drug from becoming sold widely as a fairness cosmetic. Repeated use of the cream leads to thinning of the skin, loss of elasticity and bacterial infections, among other harmful effects. It is for this that the IADVL is discouraging the use of fairness creams.</p>
<p>What explains this Indian obsession with fair skin and disdain for the dark? Some argue that a fair skin indicates social superiority, but then even among, say, the fair-skinned Kashmiris, caste is a reality. Most point to a colonial hangover that ingrained in us the idea that the ruler is always white. Some like Bangalore-based sociologist G.K. Karanth say the reverence for white skin goes back even further. &#8220;Look at the ease with which the supremacy of Alexander over Porus was accepted,&#8221; he says. But there is little doubt that the slave trade and colonialism instilled modern power equations into what was till then simply a matter of &#8216;aesthetics&rsquo;. &#8220;It then became a marker of people trying to be like the white (the one who dominated),&#8221; says sociologist Ashis Nandy.</p>
<p>Like a tool to help climb up the social ladder. Adds D.K. Bhattacharya, a retired anthropology professor from Delhi University, &#8220;There are reports from Africa where indigenous people would smear their face with limestone during Christian ceremonies to resemble the white missionaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prakash C. Jain, a professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, who has studied the Indian diaspora, says there has also been an &#8220;undercurrent of racism&#8221; between people of Indian origin and Africans in Africa. Traditionally, most Indians limited social interaction with Africans and stayed in separate housing estates. Intermarriage was practically non-existent in South Africa, with just 57 instances from the pre-World War II era to the &rsquo;60s, he points out.</p>
<p>For T.K. Oommen, emeritus professor of sociology at JNU, racism combines elements of &#8220;culturalism&#8221; and &#8220;ethnicism&#8221;. So there is the broad, implicit and very prevalent idea that Africans are culturally and ethnically inferior to Indians. &#8220;Indians have always made such distinctions. Look at the Shiv Sena that targets non-Maharashtrians or the Lachit Sena that targeted non-Assamese,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>This cultural chauvinism also explains why discrimination based on colour in India is limited not just to the blacks, but surfaces even against the whites sometimes. Julia Sullivan (name changed on request), an Australian postgraduate student at Pune University, feels it is because she represents a different culture. People from her apartment complex once came into her flat and accused her, point blank, of being a prostitute because she had many male friends and asked her to leave. &#8220;That&rsquo;s the assumption most Indians have of a western girl,&#8221; she says, arguing that racism in India is &#8220;institutionalised&#8221; unlike in Australia where it is marginalised. &#8220;It&rsquo;s normal for people here to ask somebody their origin even before their name,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>The difference between black and white doesn&rsquo;t get as stark as it does for Diepiriye Kuku, a Black American doctoral student at the Delhi School of Economics who has a white partner. They were at a Nokia shop in Delhi once. As many as five store attendants fawned over his partner asking him what he needed, &#8220;but they completely ignored me,&#8221; says Kuku. &#8220;Not once did they make eye contact with me.&#8221; It is something that happens everyday to people like Kuku. They have to adapt their lives to either being denied an existence or being turned into objects of ridicule. So much so they have to look for ways to &#8220;hide&#8221;. &#8220;I liken it to being a woman in South Asia who has to put on a veil to avoid drawing attention,&#8221; adds Kuku. The &#8216;veil&rsquo;, for him, is his iPod and sunglasses.</p>
<p>It gets worse for African women on Indian streets who have to face the supposed indignity of not just being black but also female. Maria Cleophas, a Ugandan student at Delhi&rsquo;s Indraprastha College, just cannot get over how she is stared at so routinely and humiliatingly. &#8220;It&rsquo;s extraordinary, beyond understanding. There have been times when people have groped me and even spat in my direction.&#8221; It&rsquo;s a sentiment Murtala Musa, a Nigerian who has just graduated from Delhi&rsquo;s Jamia Hamdard university, echoes. &#8220;People react as if I have suddenly sprung from the soil or have been dropped from the sky,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There have been times when people have touched my hair, thinking it&rsquo;s either rubber or burnt.It&rsquo;s almost as if they were asking me if I was human at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many, however, feel that the way we treat dark-skinned people isn&rsquo;t racism but a reflection of how unaware a large section of Indians are about people from backgrounds different than theirs. Perhaps greater trade and cultural ties with Africa might change our attitude. At least that&rsquo;s what happened between East Asia and India. &#8220;Indians realised that Europe and North America are not the only beacons of desirable values,&#8221; says Uberoi. And as Africa continues to develop in the next few years and India engages more proactively with the &#8220;dark continent&#8221;, perhaps the African too would one day not be seen as a strange species. That might be a better world where the next generation will grow up accultured and where the Black American Obama becomes the world&rsquo;s most stylish man, naturally.<br>

								<h2><a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20090629&amp;fname=Cover+Story+%28F%29&amp;sid=4">&lsquo;India Is Racist, and Happy About It&rsquo;</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Diepiriye Kuku, Outlook (New Delhi), June 29, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>In spite of friendship and love in private spaces, the Delhi public literally stops and stares. It is harrowing to constantly have children and adults tease, taunt, pick, poke and peer at you from the corner of their eyes, denying their own humanity as well as mine. Their aggressive, crude curiosity threatens to dominate unless disarmed by kindness, or met with equal aggression.</p>
<p>Once I stood gazing at the giraffes at the Lucknow Zoo only to turn and see 50-odd families gawking at me rather than the exhibit. Parents abruptly withdrew infants that inquisitively wandered towards me.</p>
<p>I felt like an exotic African creature-cum-spectacle, stirring fear and awe. Even my attempts to beguile the public through simple greetings or smiles are often not reciprocated. Instead, the look of wonder swells as if this were all part of the act and we were all playing our parts.</p>
<p>Racism is never a personal experience. Racism in India is systematic and independent of the presence of foreigners of any hue. This climate permits and promotes this lawlessness and disdain for dark skin. Most Indian pop icons have light-damn-near-white skin. Several stars even promote skin-bleaching creams that promise to improve one&rsquo;s popularity and career success. Matrimonial ads boast of fair, v. fair and v. very fair skin alongside foreign visas and advanced university degrees. Moreover, each time I visit one of Delhi&rsquo;s clubhouses, I notice that I am the darkest person not wearing a work uniform. It&rsquo;s unfair and ugly.</p>
<p>Discrimination in Delhi surpasses the denial of courtesy. I have been denied visas, apartments, entrance to discos, attentiveness, kindness and the benefit of doubt. Further, the lack of neighbourliness exceeds what locals describe as normal for a capital already known for its coldness.</p>
<p>My partner is white and I am black, facts of which the Indian public reminds us daily. Bank associates have denied me chai, while falling over to please my white friend. Mall shop attendants have denied me attentiveness, while mobbing my partner. Who knows what else is more quietly denied?</p>
<p>&#8220;An African has come,&#8221; a guard announced over the intercom as I showed up. Whites are afforded the luxury of their own names, but this careful attention to my presence was not new. ATM guards stand and salute my white friend, while one guard actually asked me why I had come to the bank machine as if I might have said that I was taking over his shift.</p>
<p>It is shocking that people wear liberalism as a sign of modernity, yet revert to ultraconservatism when actually faced with difference. Cyberbullies have threatened my life on my YouTube videos that capture local gawking and eve-teasing. I was even fired from an international school for talking about homosociality in Africa on YouTube, and addressing a class about homophobia against kids after a student called me a &#8216;fag&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Outside of specific anchors of discourse such as Reservations, there is no consensus that discrimination is a redeemable social ill. This is the real issue with discrimination in India: her own citizens suffer and we are only encouraged to ignore situations that make us all feel powerless. Be it the mute-witnesses seeing racial difference for the first time, kids learning racism from their folks, or the blacks and northeasterners who feel victimised by the public, few operate from a position that believes in change.</p>
<p>Living in India was a childhood dream that deepened with my growing understanding of India and America&rsquo;s unique, shared history of non-violent revolution. Yet, in most nations, the path of ending gender, race and class discrimination is unpaved. In India, this path is still rural and rocky as if this nation has not decided the road even worthy.It is a footpath that we are left to tread individually.<br>

		<p> Saints preserve us! Do you mean we European-descended types actually DID NOT invent &#8220;racism&#8221;? Are you suggesting it isn&rsquo;t a specifically Western malady, but also exists   &mdash;   nay, flourishes, according to your whining list of grievances   &mdash;   in India, one of the oldest civilizations in the world?</p>
<p> Perhaps it&rsquo;s not nearly as much of a &#8220;learned, hate-filled construct&#8221; as many bleeding-heart liberals would like us to think. You&rsquo;re right, though, about the Indian film stars. Light-skinned, beautiful people. It&rsquo;s obvious what skin tones these unrepentant Indians prefer, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p> Perhaps if you&rsquo;re so unhappy in India, you should go back to Africa   &mdash;   or wherever you came from.</p>

		<p>India is racist?  Is that possible?  I thought only White people could be racist.  The fact is that White people are the least racist, and this is why we&rsquo;re being genocided all over the world; this and the fact that we&rsquo;ve been inculcated with a collective sense of guilt for all the world&rsquo;s problems by the controlled media.  People who have a sense of their own peoplehood are the ones who are going to survive.</p>
<p>Wake up White people.</p>

<p>I hate to tell the ones wringing their hands over this situation, but IT ISN&rsquo;T RACISM AT PLAY!  Maybe black crime and propensity for violence has something to do with it, eh?</p>
<p>And I also hate to tell them this situation isn&rsquo;t just with the Indians.  The whole world regards blacks in the same way.</p>
<p>My advise to Africans is to save themselves some grief and stay home.</p>

<p>It is dangerous for Indians to blame us for their dysfunction. No one questions these sociologist so-called academics and are allowed to treat the West like a blank slate to blame colorism for. Not a healthy relationship.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny (if terribly non-PC) that Australians feel much the same way about Indians as Indians feel about blacks. Except, most of us have the basic good manners not to stare at them, or poke and prod them. We don&rsquo;t hate Indians but they are generally regarded as being unhygenic and untrustworthy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Living in India was a childhood dream that deepened with my growing understanding of India and America&rsquo;s unique, shared history of non-violent revolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>An extraordinary statement. A &#8216;childhood dream&rsquo;? More like a nightmare. Didn&rsquo;t this person ever read about debt slavery, the caste system, the Untouchables, and the charming custom of burning wives alive on their husband&rsquo;s funeral pyres? The ignorance of some people is amazing.</p>

		<p>If Mr Kuku thinks it&rsquo;s bad in India, he should spend a season or two in Jamaica.  After experiencing their treatment of &#8220;chi-chi men&#8221; like him, he&rsquo;ll gladly run back to India and the curious, groping children.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m as shocked as you are! Will all the books on Afro-centrism and social constructs have to be destroyed or only re-written to include a footnote about the anomaly of &#8216;racist&rsquo; Indians?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;When Krishna literally means dark,&rdquo; says Mumbai-based mythology expert Devdutt Pattanaik, &ldquo;why is he always portrayed in blue rather than in natural black?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>There are, of course, varying intensities of blue; anything from robins egg blue to royal blue. The bias and prejudice for blue skin over black skin seems to show a healthy sense of using a pleasant color over using an unpleasant color.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face facts. The color black has a natural association of invoking fear, evil, unknown, etc. It&rsquo;s built into our brains likely from seeing day and night and all the associations of dark matter with rot and decay. No amount of social engineering is going to change that.<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Most point to a colonial hangover that ingrained in us the idea that the ruler is always white.&#8221; A<br>
And this was there before colonial times. Various Whites have come through India since ancient times. It is just a fact of life that lighter people have more desirable traits including higher intelligence, more patience etc. There is a lot of ignorance in India, but everything is affirmed when foreigners come. White women are called whores because they know White women are more likely to be whores, as indicated by various statistics. They know Blacks are more likely to be criminals. And darker people do want to be lighter. Nobody puts a gun to their head to buy products that never actually make your skin lighter.</p>
<p>This person in the second article deserves what he/she gets except for the denial of a visa within this part of the article. &#8220;Discrimination in Delhi surpasses the denial of courtesy. I have been denied visas, apartments, entrance to discos, attentiveness, kindness and the benefit of doubt. Further, the lack of neighbourliness exceeds what locals describe as normal for a capital already known for its coldness.</p>
<p>My partner is white and I am black, facts of which the Indian public reminds us daily. Bank associates have denied me chai, while falling over to please my white friend. Mall shop attendants have denied me attentiveness, while mobbing my partner. Who knows what else is more quietly denied?&#8221;  The ultra-conservative behavior is just healthy and normal.  And I am tired of people picking on northern Indians for this behavior. This is actually an area where Indians actually have some coherent and rational behavior.<br>

		<p>In Malaysia, they call Indians &#8216;blacks&rsquo; if they want to insult them. I probably shouldn&rsquo;t say that cause it might not be too helpful. On the plus side, however, maybe blacks and Indians can get along better now. Or is it racist to say that? That they&rsquo;d get along better knowing that? In America I think it would be racist to suggest that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m such a racist. In so many ways.</p>
<p>Then again, being white, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s worth it to bend over backwards constantly trying to prove, one way or another, I&rsquo;m not racist. The most you can build yourself up to in this way is to an even zero.</p>

		<p>The Indians who went to Africa and the Caribbean to work alongside blacks for the British Empire did not want to bond with blacks.  Unanimously they wanted to get closer to whites.</p>
<p>Contemporary Indians express their racism towards whites by wanting to absorb us into their much greater numbers.  It would only take a couple of generations of immigration and miscegenation before Indian names and bloodlines were completely woven into white civilization, from Vienna to Vermont.  </p>
<p>They could achieve the conquest of the Western world and the white race without racist guilt,  because we will have allowed it.</p>

		<p>For all of the hero worship liberals heap upon Ghandi, the truth is, he thought blacks were an inferior race to Whites, and said so many times.  He just wanted his race to be included with the Whites.  It makes me laugh when I see liberals praising Ghandi without ever taking the time to find out the truth.

		<p>Even if the preferential treatment were irrational, it would still be a good thing for the world, for it to continue.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that even though it would make things less fair, it still has the good effect of training people to deal with allowing other people to have liberty, and to do as they wish with their own property.  It is wisest to allow people the right to be wrong, and the right to make experiments with things they own, and whom they choose to deal with.  Situations where this type of thing occurs bring the issue to light. </p>
<p>It is more important to correct this problem of bad diplomacy that the liberal types have, than it is to make people more acurate or intelligent in their prejudices or opinions of various groups.</p>

<p>Not entirely true.

		<p>I respectfully disagree with this idea about Indians. As a high school teacher I encounter second generation Indian-American kids all the time and find them to be completely assimilated as Americans. Even the ones who were born in India want so much too be part of the American culture while retaining the family values.  The older generation holds on to the traditions just as my Sicilian grandparents held on to theirs. My parents continued with the good values such as honor and respect for elders. They moved away from the more medieval aspects of the culture and in the majority became good patriotic Americans.<br>
I have no problem with Indians.  The first generation have ideas that most likely annoy their children.<br>
My son lives in a neighborhood here in S. New Jersey.  His neighbors mostly Indian immigrants. THere is minimal interaction between the adults and the non- Indian community primarily due to the language barrier but that isn&rsquo;t the case with the kids. The kids all speal English and play with the non- Indian kids. (I don&rsquo;t use the term White because Indians are considered more closely related to Caucasians.  Their physical features are very similar to ours aside from variances in skin pigmentation.  However the darkest Indians are rarely mistaken for Africans. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that I personally never read about nor heard about anyone being mugged or intimidated in school by gangs of Indian teenagers.  Neither have I ever seen large groups of Indian teenagers rampaging through the streets of any American city, breaking store window, looting, dragging non- Indians from their cars and beating and killing them.</p>

<p>That really is an ignorant statement because most of the Indians expelled from Uganda were HINDUS (and some Christians and Sikhs with a monority of muslims from the Ismaili sect - affiliated with Aga Khan and considered heretics by Sunni muslims and other Shias of which they form a part). The Islamic takeover in the UK is due to quick breeding muslim immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Somalia. The Somalis in particular refuse to work and 80% of them are on welfare. While on welfare they sit around and breed even more black African muslims until entire schools resemble Mogadishu. </p>

		<p>Just a note on the staring. I lived in India as a child and was stared at every time I left the house (I am blond). Staring in India is commonplace and acceptable. My father has home movies of me at the Delhi Zoo; as soon as a family group walks past me, all the heads swivel around in unison to stare at me. Very funny.</p>
<p>When we would stop for a picnic in the Indian countryside on a car trip (no decent restaurants or bathrooms being available), within ten minutes there would be a circle of at least 10 Indians, materialized out of nowhere, standing quietly and staring at us.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t just his black skin; being different in any way is sufficient to trigger Indian staring behavior. It isn&rsquo;t considered rude there. Ditto with asking extremely personal questions that Westerners wouldn&rsquo;t ask.</p>
<p>I also remember the Indians being very color conscious. The nicest thing you could say about a new baby is &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t she fair!&#8221; </p>

		<p>Upper caste Indians are descended from Sanskrit-speaking Aryan tribes. Their attitudes are codified in the Rig-Veda, the oldest Aryan literature in the world. The Aryans in the Rig-Veda clearly express their contempt for the darker inhabitants of India. Interestingly, swastika and Aryan are both Sanskrit words. It&rsquo;s no surprise these attitudes have persisted for thousands of years in India. Some Indian Nationalists in WWII even allied themselves with Hitler, the most famous being Subhas C. Bose. </p>

<p>A huge myth, but it is a popular one, especially among African Americans, who often consider their (India&rsquo;s) favoritism for fairness, to be a part of the caste system. Few of them realize that the caste system is built upon the notion of reincarnation, and that those who are born into a poorer sect, or more lowly occupations, were placed there, because of sins from a past life. This is strictly a Hindu belief, and one that whites played no role in. Their preference for light skinned females, even predated colonialism. But alas, why confuse them with the facts? They will always look for an excuse to demonize whites.</p>

<p>I have to disagree. Although I hate to generalize, in my experience whites are   not a monolith group in the eyes of Indians,  at least here in the U.S.  These     cream of the crop Indians are very comfortable with the urbane Northeastern or Californian whites whom they befriend in elite graduate schools, high tech /financial services companies and in professional Medical/Lawyer networks. But they distinctly treat Southern whites (particularly plain old working class folk from  states like Alabama, Missisippi,  Louisiana) and rural whites in general) with open contempt, making fun of their accents and viewing them as poorly educated, cannon fodder hicks. Indians are very classist; to them the Boston Brahmin whites are their fellow Brahmins while the Alabama redneck is the Shudra. While they wouldn&rsquo;t much reservations if their daughter brought home an Ivy League educated white investment banker, they&rsquo;d throw fits if her boyfriend was an Alabaman truck driver! I&rsquo;m also pretty sure this classist Indian attitude extends to blacks; an urbane, educated Kofi Annan type would be embraced with open arms while the inner city rapster would be avoided like the plague.</p>
<p>Also, a note of correction. The urban Indus Valley civilization of Mohenjodaro and Harrapa predates Japanese civilization by more than a millenia. It&rsquo;s as old as the Yangste Kiang/Hwang Ho civilization of China, only predates by the Egyptian and Mesopitamian/Sumerian civilizations of Iraq. The &#8220;ancientness&#8221; if  you like of Asian civilizations perhaps explain part of their superiority complexes.    </p>

<p>I remember well how the media jumped on this story, and also how the black cheerleaders from Britain acted as though it should provoke international outrage, but since it is well known that Indians favor light skinned Indian women, why did they expect them to embrace black women? It&rsquo;s obvious the Indian officials thought they were hiring indigenous white British women. Biased? maybe, bigoted? perhaps. But worthy of international uproar? When white farmers have been slaughtered in Africa due to their race, and due to the fact that they are not indigenous to the region, and the media all but ignored it, it&rsquo;s difficult to work myself into a lather, because a few cheerleaders had their egos bruised, in a country they were foreign to.</p>

<p>No surprise given the fact that Hinduism is all about the belief that a persons worth is valued by their station in life. Wealth is something you are born into, and rewarded with. Higher education is only possible for those born into the higher classes. There is no such thing as the concept of the nouveau riche in India, but in the Southern states of America you won&rsquo;t find the underclasses sweeping human waste off the streets either. India&rsquo;s Hindu culture is at heart, the antithesis of the American dream.</p>

<p>Exactly. I had a hard time understanding the point he was making here as well.  What is with this garbage about &#8220;white women being whores&#8221;?  That is news to me.  It is almost as if he meant to say &#8220;white women are the most sought after&#8221;.</p>
<p>And I am really getting tired of people assuming that Indians and arabs are somehow &#8220;civilized&#8221; in their sexual habits.  Why is it that these areas allow polygamy and the practice of child brides?  Why does India have such a high rate of aids?  Why do women in the Middle East have to be completely covered?  Why do white women get harrassed when they go to either India or anywhere in the Middle East?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t people think stuff like this through instead of making blank assumptions?  It is just the same as assuming that Indians and arabs are all brilliant people just because we have the brightest ones moving here. It is as if people don&rsquo;t stop and question why their countries are the way they are.<br>

 At least 90% of the women featured committing thses paid-for sex acts are White Americans.<br>
 I don&rsquo;t need to tell you that there literally billions upon billion of testorene fuelled Third World boys (and a good number of fully grown men), who have the major past-time of perusing these images whenever and where ever possible.</p>

<p>If there is a high demand for white women in this area you are speaking of, then there are always going to be white women to fill the role.  Please explain to me how this in any way means that &#8220;most white women are whores&#8221;?</p>

<p>1)This is America where the white population outnumbers every other group substantially.  Of course whites will dominate every medium produced here.  That&rsquo;s not a secret only Einstein knew.  Nor does it take a rocket scientist to understand it.</p>
<p>2)The other nations have porn throughout the internet; however, like everything else non-American, there&rsquo;s going to be fewer numbers and less quality.</p>
<p>3)Men are going to view the prettiest women, if given a choice, and since Caucasian women are generally prettier than any other race they&rsquo;re going to be in greater demand and also probably paid a lot more to attract them.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re really saying in your post, but I doubt you understand that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the lighter skinned, more Caucasian-looking women in India that are in greater demand.  There&rsquo;s no question of that. </p>

		<p>Raj Patel is being disingenuous. While a lot of &#8220;video&#8221; pornography is still produced in the San Fernando Valley in CA (it&rsquo;s actually declining, I&rsquo;ll get to that shortly), pornography isn&rsquo;t the question. It&rsquo;s &#8220;whores&#8221; (prostitutes). Without argument it can be stated that non-white women have higher rates of prostitution than White women, including Asians. You can check with any Police Dept. or just visit SoCal and have a look. As for organized pornography, what &#8220;sells&#8221; the most are blondes, (white) brunettes and E Asian women according to the industry itself. That&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s hired. The industry itself is actually collapsing due to the internet. There&rsquo;s &#8220;free porn&#8221; and now &#8220;home video&#8221; porn sites are popping up that emulate Youtube. It&rsquo;s actually funny to see the porn kings, the gangsters, crying and complaining about decreasing sales. </p>
<p>There seems to be a problem among many Indian males and White women. The Indian men chase after White women (you can see this all the time in CA), but most of these women are not attracted to them. Hence the bitterness, the name-calling. It&rsquo;s the same in Britain. Middle-Easterners are much the same way. In a sense, these groups are acting a lot like blacks who call White women who won&rsquo;t date blacks &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;ho&rsquo;s&#8221;.  Obfuscation and changing the subject cannot hide these facts. </p>

<p>Of course third world boys want to see white female porn stars. White women are the most beautiful women in the world. The producers make what SELLS. If dark skinned women sold well they would take over the industry, but they don&rsquo;t. Instead the dark skinned Indian women have to sell themselves on the side of the road for a few coins, no one will pay to watch them online.</p>
<p>HIV is turning into an epidemic in India due to the number of poor women and CHILDREN that have unprotected sex for a few cents. Selling children into slavery, brothels all over, ignorant truck drivers having unprotected sex left and right and then passing the disease along to their innocent wives, and even contaminating their future unborn children. It is disgusting.</p>
<p>That is NOT a problem in White American, we have more common sense and generally understand the concept of marital fidelity.<br>
