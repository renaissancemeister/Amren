<h1>Egyptians Cry Racism in Woman&rsquo;s Slaying in Germany</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maggie Michael, AP, July 6, 2009 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thousands of Egyptian mourners marched behind the coffin of the &#8220;martyr of the head scarf&#8221; on Monday  &mdash;  a pregnant Muslim woman who was stabbed to death in a German courtroom as her young son watched.</p>
<p>Many in her homeland were outraged by the attack and saw the low key response in Germany as an example of racism and anti-Muslim sentiment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no god but God and the Germans are the enemies of God,&#8221; chanted the mourners for 32-year-old Marwa al-Sherbini in her hometown of Alexandria, where her body was buried after being flown back from Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will avenge her killing,&#8221; her brother Tarek el-Sherbini told The Associated Press by telephone from the mosque where prayers were being recited in front of his sister&rsquo;s coffin. &#8220;In the West, they don&rsquo;t recognize us. There is racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Al-Sherbini, who was about four months pregnant and wore the Islamic head scarf, was involved in a court case against her neighbor for calling her a terrorist and was set to testify against him when he stabbed her 18 times inside the courtroom in front of her 3-year-old son.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The guards thought that as long as he wasn&rsquo;t blond, he must be the attacker so they shot him,&#8221; al-Sherbini told an Egyptian television station.</p>
<p>The man, who has only been identified as 28-year-old Alex W., remains in detention and prosecutors have opened an investigation on suspicion of murder.</p>
<p>Christian Avenarius, the prosecutor in Dresden where the incident took place, described the killer as driven by a deep hatred of Muslims. &#8220;It was very clearly a xenophobic attack of a fanatical lone wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the attacker was a Russian of German descent who had immigrated to Germany in 2003 and had expressed his contempt for Muslims at the start of the trial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The killing has dominated Egyptian media for days, while it has received comparatively little coverage in German and Western media.</p>
<p>A German Muslim group criticized government officials and the media for not paying enough attention to the crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;The incident in Dresden had anti-Islamic motives. So far, the reactions from politicians and media have been incomprehensibly meager,&#8221; Aiman Mazyek, the general secretary of the Central Council of Muslims, told Berlin&rsquo;s Tagesspiegel daily.</p>
<p>Egyptian commentators said the incident was an example of how hate crimes against Muslims are overlooked in comparison to those committed by Muslims against Westerners. Many commentators pointed to the uproar that followed the 2004 murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh by a Dutch-born Islamic fundamentalist angry over one of his films criticizing the treatment of Muslim women.</p>

		<p>Muslims are not a race so how is this &#8220;racism&#8221;?</p>
<p>If anything, to artificially inflate the number of white people in Europe, Egyptians are probably considered &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The hypocrisy here makes me laugh.  How can they even dare to complain about this when Egyptians regularly kill other Egyptian Copts for not being muslim?  Germany should tell Egypt to deal with their own problems before sticking their noses in those of others.</p>

		<p>There was a serial killer in the news here where I live. I swear, the local newscaster seemed disappointed when he was caught. Bank robbers were once our heroes, now in our heart of hearts it&rsquo;s serial killers. The politically correct are playing with fire. I would love to see what would happen if we had a real candidate to vote for. </p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard of this in the UK &amp; have no doubt that the press are ignoring it, but not for the reasons that the Muslims believe, but for the usual reason, which is that anything that does not portray the enrichment &amp; diversity of the multicultural EU Federal superstate must be played down or ignored. Especially at a time like now when nationalism is on the rise throughout Europe. The last thing the neo-Marxist EU controllers and their controlled media want is Italians, Spaniards, British and others viewing film of militant Muslims marching &amp; protesting in Germany or anywhere else. It will just add more fuel to the fire when even more people in various EU countries realise that this mass immigration/multicultural con trick is European-wide &amp; that they are not alone in their feeling that the neo-Marxist political elite (who control the EU) are using mass immigration/ multiculturalism to make the EU Federal superstate ireversible.</p>

		<p>Heck, in most parts of Europe or the U.K., if a native says so much as &#8216;boo&rsquo; to their Muslim conquerors, the authorities throw them in jail and/or fine them for &#8216;incitement to racism&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Somewhere there is a picture of a bruised and bloodied swedish woman who was raped by Muslim &#8220;immigrants&rsquo; for the sin of not wearing Hijab. Time to repost that as a retort. </p>
<p>As to Muslims and race, they define any child of a Muslim father as Muslim, so they certainly seem bent on becoming a racial group. Therefore we should hear their cries of racism as, pardon the pun, a veiled threat.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Muslims accuse Western media of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; for downplaying crimes against them.&#8221;</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about it if they kept their contentious masses at home where they belong.</p>
<p>Egypt would be a great place to deport African blacks too.  Then they would really have something to complain about. <br>

		<p>Muslims complain that the Western media doesn&rsquo;t cover the demise of a Muslim as it would the demise of a Westerner. </p>
<p>The media is unconsciously racist, as it reports news of genuine interest to its main readership.  Racial and ethnic groups like to hear stories about their own.  This is why South African apartheid got so much attention outside of Africa - whites were intersted in what others of the white race were doing.  </p>
<p>Unlike whites, Muslims don&rsquo;t condemn their own. They seek vengeance as a race when one of theirs is the victim.  In contrast, now that apartheid is over, whites care little about the genocide of white South African farmers.  </p>

		<p>The murder was committed by one individual with severe mental health problems, such murders unfortunately occur from time to time in all societies.<br>
 Trying to extrapolate from that as these Egyptians are trying to do that the German state &#8216;hasn&rsquo;t done enough&rsquo; or that it is &#8216;indicative of &#8220;racism&#8221; and the growth of the &#8220;far right&#8221;, is ridiculous.The fact is all Egyptian nationals are free to leave Germany at any time of their choosing.<br>
  On another note, notice the mass protestations and wailing and gnashing of teeth and denunciations of the German state in Egypt.<br>
  The ringleaders of 9/11 were Egyptian.There were no mass Egyptian protests whatsoever following the deaths of thousands of individuals in those attacks.</p>

		<p>Poor Alex W. was unable to contain his anger and frustration, and will now spend his life in prison.  I imagine there are a lot of angry young White men out there  &mdash;  they just need to get organized and channel their angst into political activism.  </p>

		<p>  I condemn the insane murder of this Egyptian woman in a German court. At the same time, a murder committed by one deranged individual is hardly a state policy. Are Muslims a race? I thought persons of any race could be Muslim?  Can these Egyptian critics point to widespread terrorist actions against Muslims committed by Germans?</p>

		<p>If they count all the Muslim women murdered in Germany, the vast vast majority of them will be the victims of domestic homicides or honor killings, murdered by their own Muslim husbands, fathers, brothers, or cousins.</p>

		<p>The Egyptians who are crying &#8220;racism&#8221; are vile hypocrites. </p>
<p>They cry &#8220;racism&#8221; as black African refugees and illegal immigrants in their country (many who are Muslims) face stabbings, beatings, and killings, with the perpetrators very often going unpunished.</p>
<p>These Black Africans are largely a societal burden in Egypt and do not belong there.</p>
<p>Egyptians are equally a societal burden to Germany and clearly do not belong there.</p>

<p>This may be true, the MSM didn&rsquo;t make a big deal about the Egyptian muslim that killed his daughters, and then flew to Egypt. We all know the details, and Egypt won&rsquo;t extradite him for the killings.

<p>While visiting Egypt, not very long ago, I asked my hotel manager about places to go out and socialize.  He mentioned a couple of places and then, when he got to one in particular, he scowled and said (in a matter of fact way)&#8221;&hellip;but that place is not safe; too many blacks&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Nearly all non-Muslims (except liberals) harbor a negative attitude towards Islam.  The Koran is a compilation of psychotic and perverted diatribes against the non-Muslim world.  If mankind awoke tomorrow to a world void of all Muslims it would utter a collective sigh of relief&hellip;  </p>
