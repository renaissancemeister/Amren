<h1>Study: White Males Hit Hardest by Georgia Job Losses</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new study [released by the Georgia Department of Labor] shows white males are bearing the burden of job losses in Georgia, contradicting conventional thought that minorities typically suffer more from unemployment during down economic times.</p>
<p>{snip} It found the number of men of any race drawing unemployment insurance increasing 160 percent from December 2007 through May.</p>
<p>Among white males, it increased 211 percent, to 51,562 men. That&rsquo;s compared to a 78.8 percent increase for black females  &mdash;  the smallest increase in unemployment benefit claims among any of the four groups studied.</p>

		<p>The irony is incredible.  All over the United States the impression is given that every group under the sun is some sort of a victim or has a right to some kind of victimhood status in this country.  There is no doubt that Whites ARE the REAL victims here.  We are the ones being discriminated against and no one else, and the tragic thing is that most of us are asleep.  We&rsquo;re either asleep or if we do have some awareness of what&rsquo;s going on, we&rsquo;re on the run, running from our previous neighborhood or state.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure most of the non-whites in Georgia are employed by the state in useless make-work jobs which are funded, of course, by taxes paid by working whites. As the legitimate economy collapses the legitimately employed whites are the first to lose their jobs. I&rsquo;m sure the public employee unions will ensure that public jobs aren&rsquo;t cut until they bankrupt Georgia like they have California and most other states.</p>

		<p>Not all of the white men in Georgia are having it so rough.  Those of us who were prepared for this are doing fine.  I prepared long ago by putting my wife through college twice.  We also prepared long ago by adapting to only 1 paycheck and putting the rest in savings.  I knew long ago that the middle class was under attack and that the only survivors were going to be families with a plan.  If you&rsquo;re not prepared, you&rsquo;re not anything.<br>

		<p>Any surprise here?  If black women work at all, they work for the gub&rsquo;mint in make-work jobs.  If a job never had any purpose to begin with, it&rsquo;s hard to come up with a reason to terminate it.  And it&rsquo;s especially hard when those employees are a minefield of discrimination lawsuits.</p>

		<p>Instead of using the headline &#8220;White males&#8221;, it&rsquo;s better to use White men. </p>
<p>I hate the term White males. It&rsquo;s usually meant to demasculinatize adult White men.</p>

		<p>The State of California, whose State and county administration is overwhelmingly non-White is practicing open descrimination against Whites, especially older White Males.  I learned this from a friend in California just last Sunday.  A mutual high school alumni of ours has been working in statistical reports for the State Dept of Labor, I believe.  He frankly said that the State doesn&rsquo;t like to hire White men because they litigate more often.  Why would they,? because they get treated poorly ont he job and denied promotions regularly.  Why is that,? because thanks to forty years of Affirmative Action and reinforcement from many places that bashing White men is not only okay, but encouraged - there is hardly any place where a Whtie man can work without frustration.</p>
<p>Grob Hahn is quite an individual!  Well, &#8220;Grob&#8221; - kudos to you for getting your wife to go to college twice and support you while you save up you dough.  But when the dollar crashes and/or grows worthless due to inflation you will finally know your financial scheme was all for nought.  I PREDICT that will happen.  And when it does, it will be those who learned and practiced basic life skills and can tolerate other Whites, not look down on them - that will survive though being able to establish a community within the chaos.  Cheeky Elitists like &#8220;Grob&#8221; Hahn will find that sitting on top of a pile of money and looking down on others doesn&rsquo;t equal race or personal survival. </p>
<p>We need to make sure that White men everywhere, especially race realists, have ways to earn a living.  Not everyone can be a &#8220;Grob&#8221; Hahn!</p>

		<p>The race-replacement of Native Born White Americans and the low wage-nowage economy go hand in hand.</p>
<p>In a debate, the race-replacement immigration enthusaist will always the &#8220;boogey-man&#8221; of labor scarcities. White Nationialists are very enthusiasitc about labor sarcities. WE see them as wonderfull things. Labor scarcities are an opportuity to create a high wage economy and transfer power away from the greeding cheating class back to millions of ordinary Native Born White Americans. </p>

		<p>This is part of the plan. The Republicrats at both the state and federal levels are only interested in obtaining and maintaining the black and hispanic votes. The exit polls percentages for White male voters has been stagnant for the last four election cycles. The huge growth in the number of hispanics and their votes is what the corrupt politicians are interested it. </p>
<p>On the home front for me, my high-tech Dutch conglomerate employer sticks to the politically correct diversity line. We had a huge layoff in December 2008 that was TARGETED at younger White, male engineers leaving the token blacks and hispanics intact&hellip;alongside the H1B East Indians and Chinese. The only saving grace is that Microsoft is still growing and immediately hired up the White male engineers over at Bing city.</p>
<p>Clearly White Males are not a cohesive, racially aware and centric group and are still willing to take it in the shorts at every opportunity. Just a matter of time though&hellip;</p>

		<p>While I applaud the foresight of Grob, I also think he is exhibiting a characteristic trait of most whites, the ¨I´ve got mine, Jack¨attitude. You can´t tell me that in this economy all you need is advanced planning to survive. </p>
<p>I think a better way of seeing things is ¨There but for the grace of God go I¨ and take an overall look at how at this stage white males are the ¨low men on the totem pole¨ in this society conrolled by the minorities. Since as far as the newest generation is concerned whites are now just another minority in a nation of minorities, albeit the largest, we need to start playiing hardball like the rest of them and try to counter-attack against our ongoing dispossession. For this an Ayn Rand type of individualism is definitely not the answer.</p>

		<p>This story, White males suffering highest unemployment&hellip; simply suggests to me Blacks in Georgia are less interested in WORKING for a living&hellip; than White males. But then Blacks enjoy collecting welfare more than Whites&hellip; something described as a lack of pride and self-respect.</p>

<p>You hit the nail rght on the head. Free market aracialism is a dead-end political strategy for Native Born White Americans. It is at its core incompatible the idea of community and solidarity which is absolutely crucial to building a White Nationalist movement. This is very likley the reason why so many adults are on antidepresants.</p>
<p>And let us be honest. Ron Paul&rsquo;s political movement is pushing free market aracialism. If it were up to Ron Paul, his supporters over at Taki.com and Thomas Flemming elderly Native Born White Americans would die in poverty as Wall Street dealers gambled away senior citizens Social Security benefits in the stock market. </p>
<p>Native Born White Males should not be forced to compete in a globalized labor market just because the free market fanatics and their greedy cheating paymasters demand it.</p>
<p> Unregulated Free market capitalism is incompatible is corrosive in families and communities. The greedy cheating class use their enotmous wealth-stolen from millions of Native Born White Americans for four decades-use thier wealth to protect themslves and their offspring from the free market. Look no further than the Bush family. Free market enthusiasts William F Buckley and his son Christopher were protected from the free market by a trust fund set up by Buckley&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>I am for a protectionist labor policy and trade policy.</p>

		<p>In about 30 years, whites won&rsquo;t be able to get a job in this country.  Once blacks and hispanics manage to breed up to the majority status, America will irrevocably revert to tribal politics.  Whites will be affirmative actioned out of the country.  If things go really badly, we will be looking at a genocidal war similar to that of South Africa.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it will be similar to South Africa at all; even when &#8216;whites&rsquo; cease to make up the majority, they will still be a clear plurality, at least going by the definition of &#8216;whiteness&rsquo; used by the current system. Once &#8216;tribal politics&rsquo; becomes acceptable for the white group   &mdash;   and it probably will, if things keep getting worse and worse   &mdash;   what makes you suppose that they won&rsquo;t be able to at least prevent this sort of &#8216;phasing out&rsquo; process concerning employment? Up to this point, tribal politics has been a completely non-white affair; but, if things continue to deteriorate, I don&rsquo;t think this situation will remain unchanged forever.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;We have only ourselves to blame for this situation. Mistake One: Bringing slaves to America. Mistake Two: Not sending them back home after emancipation. Oh what a different country this would be, if we had done this.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often thought about that; without a doubt, long-term contact with blacks has severely retarded the development of our civilization. We&rsquo;re talking literally centuries of cultural development, linguistic development, political development, etc. Think about where our civilization was just 100 years ago with regard to these qualities; if northwest European civilization hadn&rsquo;t been burdened with &#8216;uplifting&rsquo; and struggling with underachieving minorities, god only knows how far ahead we would be. Our whole way of life has been thrown off-course due to the conflicts and &#8216;dumbing down&rsquo; of cultural standards. </p>
<p>A full-blown eugenics program would&rsquo;ve been established probably half a century ago at the latest, ensuring that we would always continue to &#8216;breed upward&rsquo; in terms of health, intelligence, character, etc. </p>
<p>It will take centuries just to undo the negative effects from this exposure, if we even recover at all&hellip;</p>

		<p>Forgive my ineptitude with computers, but can anyone direct me to some rock-solid figures on what proportion of employed Blacks are employed by government?  I&rsquo;ve seen the rooms full of sullen and nearly idle Black clerks, but I&rsquo;d like to see some numbers.  It&rsquo;s essential that it be the percent of EMPLOYED Blacks with government jobs, since including the large number of incarcerated and otherwise unemployable Blacks would conceal the evidence of Black dependence on White taxpayers.  I suspect that most of the Black &#8220;middle class&#8221; lives on handouts, but I&rsquo;d like to confirm it.</p>
