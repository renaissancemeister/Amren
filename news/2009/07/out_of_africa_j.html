<h1><a href="https://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/ourtown/090709/">Out of Africa: Jiba Molei Anderson&rsquo;s Superhero Comics Sprang From Yoruba Mythology</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed M. Koziarski, Chicago Reader, July 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In 1999, when Jiba Molei Anderson set out to self-publish his Afrocentric superhero comic The Horsemen, he knew the strikes against him. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a black-owned, independent company doing a comic book about seven African and African-American characters,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I should have failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t. At 36, Anderson&rsquo;s had ten years of modest success as a self-publisher, and in February his three-part collection The Horsemen: Divine Intervention will be released nationwide by Arcana Comics as a trade paperback. Anderson is publishing another comic, The Horsemen: The Book of Olorun, through his own Griot Enterprises this month. And the Silver Room opens a solo exhibition of his work on Friday.</p>
<p>The Horsemen series follows a band of seven orishas  &mdash;  manifestations of the Yoruba god Olodumare  &mdash;  who possess a group of young, black, professional Detroiters to save humanity from the Deitis, a multicultural pantheon of corrupt orishas with a vested interest in getting us to worship &#8220;politics, commerce, technology, war, sex, life, death, and organized religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My goal,&#8221; Anderson notes, &#8220;was to say, &#8216;Yeah, they&rsquo;re black  &mdash;  get over it. I&rsquo;m about to write some shit up in here, and I&rsquo;m about to liberally reference African and African-American culture, but I&rsquo;m also about to liberally reference world culture.&rsquo; The Horsemen are not fighting drug dealers. They&rsquo;re not battling homelessness or inner-city crime or any of the typical tropes that you assign to black superheroes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comic book industry hasn&rsquo;t been kind to African-American characters and creators, stereotyping the former and marginalizing the latter. There&rsquo;s been intermittent progress since the 1990s, with the success of black heroes like Spawn and Blade and the founding of the Milestone imprint (which DC Comics recently revived) by a group of black artists. But black character/creator combinations remain rare in an industry that, despite the growing diversity of its audience, still pitches much of its content to white, middle-class teenage boys.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anderson got his first shot at it in 1995, when he was hired by Chicago writer La Morris Richmond to ink Jigaboo Devil, a comic about a black revolutionary leader who sports a Sambo mask and wields a machete.</p>
<p>After graduating that same year, Anderson came to Chicago to study visual communication at the School of the Art Institute. The Horsemen began as part of his MFA thesis: an illustrated history of African-American superheroes and their connection to African mythology. &#8220;I was studying the religion of the Yoruba and how it survived the slave trade in Cuba and Haiti, with Santeria and so forth,&#8221; he says. He named each chapter for a Yoruba god and depicted the gods as superheroes. &#8220;I was like, &#8216;These concepts are too cool to throw away.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The week the first Spider-Man movie was released, in May 2002, not-yet-disgraced New York Times reporter Jayson Blair wrote about Griot, using material apparently cribbed from a story that had already appeared in Detroit&rsquo;s Metro Times. After that the partners started getting calls from Hollywood. Anderson soon split with Larson and Marshall, pursuing his own mainstream aspirations. He kept the company, but each artist retained the rights to his creations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Divine Intervention was originally scheduled to come out this month, but has been pushed back till February. Meanwhile, Anderson&rsquo;s selling The Book of Olorun himself, online and through local retailers G-Mart Comics, Challengers Comics + Conversation, and Graham Crackers Comics. &#8220;Why wait?&#8221; he says. &#8220;I control the property. I&rsquo;ve done it myself before. I can do it myself again.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Seems odd to call a team of Mythological African superheros &#8220;the Horsemen&#8221; I wasn&rsquo;t aware that black Africans ever had cavalry or even had any sort of domesticated animals. The hated Arab slave traders on the other hand&hellip;.<br>

		<p>Mr. Anderson is an example of a minority who is making his own opportunities. Instead of whining about why Marvel or DC don&rsquo;t have enough black superheroes, he is designing his own. Good for him. If the stories are good enough, he just might find audiences of all races.</p>
<p>The comic book industry is pretty fickle. For every Superman and Batman, there are hundreds of other heroes who failed. </p>
<p>The big challenge is to find more blacks willing to read not only anderson&rsquo;s work, but to read anything period.</p>

<p>The p.c. comics industry has been more than kind to black comics writers; it&rsquo;s the fans themselves who refuse to buy their poorly-scripted, hackneyed schlock.</p>
<p>Since white novelists, screenwriters and playwrites are more talented than their black counterparts, why should we be surprised that the same holds true for comic book scribes?</p>

		<p>Black comic book characters never sold well. I wonder what the sales will be like for this book.</p>

		<p>I see nothing wrong with this. Blacks can do what they want. More the distance between us in our culture and preferences, the better it is for both our races.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s funny! I thought the job of the comic book industry was well, to SELL COMICS. Silly Me&hellip;</p>
