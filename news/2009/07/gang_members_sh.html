			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Demian Bulwa, Henry K. Lee, San Francisco Chronicle, July 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two suspected members of the MS-13 gang have been arrested and a third is being sought in the Daly City slaying of a 21-year-old college student who was shot because his friends were wearing red  &mdash;  a color claimed by a rival gang  &mdash;  police said Thursday.</p>
<p>One of Moises Frias Jr.&rsquo;s companions was wearing a red sweater, and another a red-and-white San Francisco 49ers cap, when their car was riddled with bullets near the Daly City BART Station on Feb. 19. Frias died before he could reach the hospital, and two of the other three young men in the car were wounded.</p>
<p>None of the victims had anything to do with gangs, investigators said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Daly City police Detective Gregg Oglesby noted that Frias&rsquo; shooting was strikingly similar to the June 2008 killing of a San Francisco father, Tony Bologna, and his two sons in the Excelsior neighborhood. Prosecutors say another member of MS-13  &mdash;  a subset of the Sureño gang, which claims the color blue  &mdash;  opened fire after mistaking one of the sons for a member of the rival Norteños, who claim red.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Around the Bay Area, authorities say several such cases of mistaken gang affiliation in recent years have prompted killings, assaults and robberies. Many young Latino men say they are routinely &#8220;checked,&#8221; or asked whether they are Norteño or Sureño.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the Daly City case, Danilo Velasquez, 28, was arrested early Wednesday in San Francisco. Luis Herrera, 18, was already at San Francisco County Jail on suspicion of auto theft and possession of a gun that was later determined to have been used to kill Frias, police said. Both have been charged with murder with the special circumstance of lying in wait, three counts of attempted murder and enhancements for participating in a criminal street gang and weapons possession.</p>
<p>A third alleged gang member, Jaime Balam, 20, was deported to his native Mexico eight days after the shooting  &mdash;  but before he was identified as a suspect  &mdash;  and is still being sought. Police said Balam, who had been deported once before, was picked up by federal immigration agents in San Francisco on Feb. 24.</p>

		<p>Just a small price to pay for all of the colorful vibrant culture that these invaders, I mean, immigrants bring.  I mean just think, if the Bay Area was overwhelmingly white you could probably walk anywhere you chose at any hour and not be murdered for the clothes you&rsquo;re wearing, man that&rsquo;s just white bread.</p>

		<p>IIRC, a while back,some Staples employees were beaten up because they were wearing their work uniforms  &mdash;  red shirts. Was this in California?</p>
<p>The local high school here tries to ban both red and blue for student clothing, but gangs have claimed basically all colors, depending on the &#8220;set&#8221; or &#8220;crew&#8221;  &mdash;  </p>

		<p>It makes me sick what has happened to San Francisco and the whole Bay area. My Aunt and Uncle used to live there in the 60&rsquo;s. One of those nice Victorian row houses on a hill. I was 10 years old. The GG Bridge, GG Park, Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, Ghirardelli Square, Telegraph Hill. I thought it was paradise, and they were so lucky to live there, while my family was relegated to boring old Anaheim. The last time I went there, in 2004, what a hole! Scary. The best part of town was Chinatown, and THAT was dirty as H-E-Double Toothpicks! I dread to see what&rsquo;s become of Anaheim. I haven&rsquo;t been there since 1990. </p>

<p>In this case it was the oppressed brown masses. MS 13 (Marasalvatrucha) is a latino gang, originally started by Salvadoran &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; who were fighting with Mexicans - in Los Angeles. They&rsquo;ll shoot each other for being in other gangs or for wearing the wrong color hats, shoes, bandanas, whatever. They&rsquo;ll attack, beat, shoot whites merely for being white. </p>

<p>As I recall, various gangs have all of the primary colors claimed, and some of the others. SO! in the end, if one wears ANY color, some other color is going to try to kill you.</p>

		<p>When I worked for a pizza delivery company in my younger days there was a young black guy who drove for us. One evening he left in his red company work shirt, drove to an apartment complex in a Crip neighborhood and was asked why he was dressed like a Blood. He failed to heed the warning, and a few minutes later he was shot dead.</p>

<p>In my state some years ago, some blacks shot and killed a deaf man. They mistook his sign language for gang signs. </p>

<p>I am white and live in a small town in the South. I was &#8220;checked&#8221; by a black man in a grocery store parking lot. I happened to be wearing a blue shirt that day. </p>
<p><i>When I worked for a pizza delivery company&hellip;</i> </p>
<p>Same scenario happened to a pizza delivery man in the capital city of my state. Fortunately for him the dumb Crips couldn&rsquo;t aim.  </p>

		<p>WOW! This is supposed to be America the great icon of freedom that all other countries look up too and now we can&rsquo;t even wear the color cloths we want.  This is what the joys of multiculturalism has brought us and we owe it all to liberals.  Gangs like MS-13 and the Crypts and Bloods and so on can only do what they do because they all have an IQ of about 20 and destruction is inherent in their genes but most liberals should know better because they have a combined IQ of at least 50 and &#8220;self destruction&#8221; is inherent in &#8220;THEIR&#8221; genes.   </p>

		<p>A guy I knew at work said his grade school daughter came home from school one day with a flyer advising parents not to dress their children in certain colors due to gang concerns. He says he told his wife to start packing. They moved up this way and settled in a 98 percent white foothill community and their children had a nice safe area to live and school to attend. He parents had made the right move.</p>
<p>In this same community a group of white people, who no doubt moved up for similar reasons, but won&rsquo;t admit it, held a rally for diversity. The little protest even made the eleven o&rsquo;clock news.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people wanted to throw eggs at them.</p>

		<p>Mayor Newsom, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Barbara Boxer, Nancy Pelosi, and the far left in California has learned nothing absolutely nothing, after the cold blooded murder in San Francisco of long time family the Bologna&rsquo;s. Mr. Bologna, a hardworking, and honest family man and his two teenage sons were gunned down in broad daylight by an illegal alien with a criminal record. The San Francisco Democratic machine allowed him to roam freely and even boasted, under Mayor Newsom, how illegal aliens would not be investigated or hindered in any way. </p>
<p>Perhaps the situation with the far left is worse than anyone can imagine. Maybe they aren&rsquo;t interested in the citizenry at all. Maybe they have elected a &#8220;New People&#8221; in the form of the millions of border criminals who are in the nation illegally. Americans are on their own, might be the new credo the leftists are operating under. The only mystery that remains, is why the American citizenry allows the left to carry on their subversion against them. Over and over, Pelosi, Feinstein, Boxer, and hundreds of other far leftists continue to be elected by the dumb and numb American citizenry.</p>

		<p>Dear &#8220;GoAway,&#8221;</p>
<p>You would cry if you could see Anaheim today.  A friend of mine lives there.  Last time I visited her, the area was every bit as invaded as the part of the San Fernando Valley (aka &#8220;Tijuana North&#8221;) where I live.  </p>
<p>My friend works in an Anaheim public school.  One time she showed me the list of forbidden gang attire that is distributed to every parent of a child in the school district.  The list was long.  Buttoning the top button of one&rsquo;s shirt, while leaving the second button open, means you&rsquo;re in a gang.  Skipping a belt loop when you put your belt on means you&rsquo;re in a gang.  Lots of formerly innocent items of clothing, such as certain colors, certain words on T-shirts, certain team logos, etc., cannot be worn.  The list went on and on.  </p>
<p>And all of this has to be enforced.  There are employees who regularly drop in to the classrooms to check for these gang signs.  If they spot a child whose belt has skipped one of the loops, for instance, they tell the kid to fix it.  But according to my friend, as soon as the employee leaves, the kid just switches his belt back to the way it was.  I just wonder how much time, money and manpower are devoted to all of this.  The banned clothing list is constantly changing, too, so employees have to really keep on top of it and keep updating and distributing the list.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous.  When I went to school there was never any of this.  It&rsquo;s no wonder the public schools cost over $10,000 per year per pupil, last time I heard.</p>

		<p>MS-13 members shot some college students, huh?  It sure is a good thing San Francisco has that illegal alien sanctuary law, because otherwise these MS-13 thugs would have to kill folks back in Guatemala and El Salvador, where they probably wouldn&rsquo;t have access to as many university students.</p>

		<p>I always wondered why my father left San Francisco when I was three months old.  I had always assumed he was in terrible grief over the death of my mother, and wanted to move to Texas to be closer to his family.  I mean he left everything&hellip;he shut down his chiropractic clinic, left his friends, neighbors&hellip;</p>
<p>Then in 2001 I visited San Francisco for the first time in sixteen years.  Our house/his office was now located right in the middle of the barrio.  Needless to say, the Spanish I took in high school came in handy trying to get a cab to get the heck out of there.  </p>
<p>I wish I could say Houston is better, but that would be an obfuscation of the truth&hellip;here we also have MS 13 and the Mexican Mafia&hellip;now we have Tango Blast, which is quite popular with our Mexican youth&hellip;a few weeks ago a young Hispanic student and his girlfriend were gunned down in a public park, caught in the cross hairs between a gang fight.</p>
<p>I need to finish my degree here, and I love Texas, the history, the culture&hellip;but I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if I can stand it any longer. We are slowly seceding back to Mexico, the nation that was stupid enough to give us away, the nation that sends its poor, uneducated, unskilled masses to el Norte, who in turn drain our economy and turn our neighborhoods into Third World hellholes.</p>
<p>I have family in East Texas&hellip;it&rsquo;s still predominantly white, but even that&rsquo;s beginning to change.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s nowhere left to run&hellip;I cannot afford to move to another state yet, and what&rsquo;s the point?  Whites move further north, and the parasitic illegals trail them because they know that the gringos are taking the jobs with them.</p>
<p>Just once I&rsquo;d like to go to the store without having to wait for the mamasita with six kids and a seventh in the oven to cash her WIC voucher.  I&rsquo;d like to find a payphone that isn&rsquo;t being hogged by Paco and Jose to make long distance calls back to Veracruz.  I wish I could move closer to my job and my school without feeling the need to buy a handgun just to feel safe sleeping at night&hellip;</p>
<p>Is there no recourse?</p>
