<h1>DMV Must Rehire Whistleblower</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristin Collins, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), July 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The state must rehire a Division of Motor Vehicles examiner who was fired after complaining that illegal immigrants might be getting licenses in violation of state law, a Wake County judge ruled Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jeffrey M. Brown, who issued driver licenses in a New Bern DMV office from July 2006 to April 2007, will get about $70,000 in back pay and the right to return to his job after winning a civil lawsuit against the state. Wake County Superior Court Judge Howard Manning said Brown was entitled to protection under the state Whistleblower Act.</p>
<p>Brown, of Trenton, sued the state in September 2007. At that time, the DMV&rsquo;s policy allowed some immigrants with temporary work visas to renew licenses for 4 or 8 years. That meant that their legal status in the country might expire before their licenses did, and it conflicted with a state law that said licenses should expire at the same time as visas. The problem did not affect new licenses, because they required more documentation.</p>
<p>State law has since tightened further, and the DMV has changed its policy to ensure that immigrant licenses expire at the same time as their legal visas. Illegal immigrants no longer have any avenue to get licenses in North Carolina.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was being forced to give licenses to illegals,&#8221; Brown said after the ruling. His supervisors &#8220;specifically told me, &#8216;Keep your mouth shut and keep issuing these licenses.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>DMV officials testified that they were doing their best to comply with a law that, at the time, was in flux. They said their policy was to treat equally all those who presented a Social Security card, whether temporary or permanent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could not discriminate,&#8221; said Dolphus Marshburn, Brown&rsquo;s supervisor.</p>
<p>But they said Brown&rsquo;s firing had nothing to do with his complaints about DMV policy. They said Brown was a problem employee with negative attitudes about immigrants.</p>
<p>In his notice of termination, DMV supervisors cited three incidents that led to his firing. In one, he became angry when he didn&rsquo;t get requested vacation time. The other two involved immigrants.</p>
<p>In the first, his &#8220;suspicious&#8221; feeling led him to call the U.S. State Department to check a Middle Eastern man&rsquo;s visa. The man was handcuffed and detained until it was determined that his visa was legal. In another, Brown told a co-worker that he suspected a different Middle Eastern man of being a terrorist and made negative comments about Muslims, the letter says.</p>

		<p>They had to throw in the &#8220;got angry when he didn&rsquo;t get requested vacation time&#8221; to make him LOOK like a trouble maker.  Like he is the first one to ever grumble when refused a day off.  They really didn&rsquo;t like him taking his job seriously.</p>

		<p>I wonder what happened to his &#8220;supervisors&#8221;, the ones who were okaying the illegals drivers licenses and the same one who told Mr. Brown to &#8220;Keep your mouth shut&#8221;?  The article didn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Negative attitudes about immigrants&#8221; huh?  If everyone had those same negative attitudes we&rsquo;d all be better off for it.</p>

		<p>There citizenry of North Carolina must demand that the people, all of them, repsonsible for firing this man, including the Supervisor in charge at the time this happened, be investigated, fined, and fired. Americans are allowing this illegal immigration issue to get out of hand, and are going to receive a serious backlash because of it. More emnity is building, more hate is gathering up, all because Americans will not force their elected representatives to MAKE THE LAWS OF THE U.S. MEAN SOMETHING. Americans are allowing these leftists to commit social mayhem on this nation that it will never recover from.</p>

		<p>If he had a negative attitude toward illegals, I like him already. Amazing now that in this country if you actually try to get anyone to FOLLOW the laws, you get punished. I guess that&rsquo;s considered a &#8216;Double Double Standard.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I like how the DMV and the reporter just throw him under the bus as a crazy racist.  As if one would have to be absolutely insane to see a problem with giving legal US documentation to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Note the use of the term &#8220;in flux&#8221;.  That means, basically, we&rsquo;re waiting for the immigration laws go away.  Notice no mention of whether his whistleblowing efforts actually made any difference.  I&rsquo;m sure his complaints were just swept under the rug.</p>

		<p>This man is a hero and should be rewarded for his vigilance, not fired by his traitorous superiors!</p>
<p>Here is why..</p>
<p>&#8220;When [9/11 hijackers] Hanjour and Almihdhar showed up at DMV Express [in Virginia], they apparently already had two forms of ID  &mdash;  a passport and a legal visa would have been accepted  &mdash;  -because they did not submit DL6s to establish their identity. But they did submit DL51s, to &#8220;prove&#8221; their Virginia residence. Martinez [an illegal alien day laborer from El Salvador who they&rsquo;d hired to help them get driver&rsquo;s licenses] allegedly certified the forms for both of them.</p>
<p>On the forms, the men claimed to live in an apartment complex on the 5900 block of Leesburg Pike  &mdash;  one block down from the strip mall. &#8220;This address did not belong to either Hanjour or Almihdhar,&#8221; [FBI agent] Gomez wrote in his affidavit, &#8220;but was rather the address that appeared on Martinez&rsquo;s Virginia identification card. Martinez no longer lived at the address, but had in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>With their newly minted photo IDs, the two suspected terrorists drove back with Martinez to Culmore. &#8220;At the 7-Eleven they all got out of the van,&#8221; wrote Gomez. &#8220;Hanjour and Almihdhar went inside the store and appeared to use the ATM machine. They then came out, paid Martinez $100 in cash for his efforts, and left in the van. Martinez did not see them again.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Virginia DMV had not seen the last of these two. Hanjour and Almihdhar were now qualified to certify the legal residency of other terrorists.</p>
<p>That is exactly what they did the next day  &mdash;  at a DMV about three miles from the Pentagon on South Four Mile Run in Arlington.</p>
<p>Wrote Special Agent Gomez: &#8220;DMV records also show that Hanjour and Almihdhar used the address Martinez gave them on August 1, 2001, to complete DL51 forms for [9/11 hijackers] Majed Moqed (Moqed) and Salem Alhazmi (Alhazmi) on August 2, 2001&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Three other suspected hijackers showed up at the Arlington DMV that very same day. They, too, needed witnesses to help them secure Virginia IDs. But unlike Hanjour and Almihdhar, they needed not only DL51s, to establish a residence, but also DL6s, to establish their identities. That meant they had to have the help of a witness, a notary, and a lawyer&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;Herbert and Lopez-Flores [also illegal alien day laborers] got into Herbert&rsquo;s car and drove to an attorney&rsquo;s office on Columbia Pike in Falls Church. The three Arab men followed in their van&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the Arab men in the office that day was Ahmed Alghamdi, one of the suspected hijackers of United Airlines Flight 175, which flew into the World Trade Center towers. Lopez-Flores vouched for his DL51 form, on which Alghamdi falsely claimed to live on Edison Street in Alexandria.</p>
<p>Abdul Alomari was another one of the Arab men in the law office that day. He is a suspected hijacker of American Airlines Flight 11, which also crashed into the World Trade Center towers. Alomari claimed to live on Buchanan Street in Arlington. &#8220;Oscar Armando Diaz,&#8221; whom the FBI believes to be Villalobos, certified Alomari&rsquo;s residency on the DL51. (The actual resident at this location was Villalobos&rsquo; cousin.)</p>
<p>Villalobos, who told the FBI he believed the men to be Pakistani or Iraqi, added an interesting note. &#8220;Villalobos said the attorney then came out of his office and signed the forms as well,&#8221; wrote Special Agent Weidner. &#8220;Here, Villalobos noted that the attorney conversed with the &#8216;Pakistanis&rsquo; in &#8216;their language.&rsquo; After this conversation, each &#8216;Pakistani&rsquo; man paid the secretary $35, and then all returned to the Arlington DMV office. Once back at the DMV office, the &#8216;Pakistani&rsquo; men paid Villalobos $50 for his assistance and then went into the DMV to get identification cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the FBI later showed Villalobos photos of the suspected September 11 hijackers, he identified five of them  &mdash;  Hani Hanjour, Salem Alhazmi, Majed Moqed, Khalid Alghamdi and Abdul Alomari  &mdash;  as being at the Arlington DMV that day. &#8220;These identifications,&#8221; Special Agent Weidner wrote, &#8220;were later confirmed by Virginia DMV records which show that all five men did in fact conduct various transactions relating to Virginia identifications cards at the Arlington DMV on August 2, 2001&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There is lots more on the 9/11 hijackers and the 56 driver&rsquo;s licenses they had between them.</p>
