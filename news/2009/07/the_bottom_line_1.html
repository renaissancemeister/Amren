<h1>The Bottom Line: At This Summer Session in Watts, Black Students Need Not Apply</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Betty Pleasant, Los Angeles Wave, July 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some parents, teachers and staff are seething at John Ritter Elementary School in Watts over a situation not seen since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its 1954 landmark Brown vs. Board of Education decision integrating the country&rsquo;s public schools.</p>
<p>But here it is, 2009, and some people see the shadow of Jim Crow looming over Watts and they&rsquo;re mad about it. Why? Because Ritter  &mdash;  a public school  &mdash;  began a summer session for its students Monday in which all the subject matter is taught in Spanish. No child who does not speak Spanish (read: no Black child) is in it.</p>
<p>This separate thing at Ritter is far from being equal because the Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled summer school this year for all of its elementary and middle school children, so no child speaking any language is receiving summer school instruction, except at Ritter.</p>
<p>You see, Ritter is one of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa&rsquo;s 10 Partnership for Los Angeles Schools that he runs with private funds he&rsquo;s obtained from somewhere. Ritter is in Villaraigosa&rsquo;s &#8220;school district.&#8221; The LAUSD has no real control over the mayor&rsquo;s schools and, in fact, did not even know that Ritter was providing a summer school of any kind  &mdash;  let alone a segregated kind  &mdash;  until I told them and provided the documents to prove it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I did, however, had a lengthy interview with Marshall Tuck, the CEO of Villaraigosa&rsquo;s Partnership for Los Angeles Schools organization. He explained that the four-week, Spanish-speaking only summer school at Ritter resulted from the suspension a few months ago of the Dual Language Immersion Program at Ritter in which instruction was provided in both English and Spanish. He said Ritter&rsquo;s program, which had operated for several years, was closed because of its &#8220;low quality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though it had poor outcomes, Tuck said the parents of some of the dual language students were very upset about the closure of the program and wanted their children to continue to be taught in Spanish. &#8220;The Partnership agreed to do something for these families, so we offered those kids who had been in the defunct dual language program an alternative,&#8221; Tuck said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Be that as it may, he&rsquo;s created even more upset parents, one of whom said to me: &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t have [a summer session] for all the students, why have it at all? I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s right. They appease one group and offend another.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Ritter employee, who requested anonymity because they are not allowed to talk to the media, said this Spanish-language summer school adversely impacts not only Black students, but Black staff members, as well. &#8220;Blacks who normally work here are off for the summer. Black teachers, teachers&rsquo; aides and office staff wanted to work the month the school is open, but they were told they couldn&rsquo;t work their usual jobs and all of them have been replaced by Hispanics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I can think of several things that could be next: How about a lawsuit extending Brown vs. Board of Education to privately funded educational activities conducted on public property? How about making mayors and others with private funds establish private schools in which they can mete out preferential treatment to their hearts&rsquo; content? How about having one unified public school district in control of all the public schools? How about letting educators run the public schools and politicians run something else? How about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>

		<p>Just think of all those years and all the effort that Blacks devoted to building alliances with other minorities in their single-minded quest to poke a stick in the eye of &#8220;The Man&#8221;.</p>
<p>They simply ended up blinding themselves.</p>
<p>What goes around, comes around.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t quite call this &#8220;a situation not seen since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its 1954 landmark Brown vs. Board of Education decision&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had plenty of sessions, trainings, internships, seminars, etc. that blatantly excluded Whites from participation. That Blacks would be excluded is a rather novel twist, one that we&rsquo;ll hear more of in the coming years as our new favored minority  enthusiastically pushes Blacks out of the way.</p>
<p>What goes around&hellip;</p>

		<p>Like I said in another story of today, if you show fear in front of the dogs, they&rsquo;ll shred you to pieces.  Question Diversity the psychic predicts that the NAACP will take no serious action against this Spanish program, because unlike pandering whites, Mestizo Hispanics don&rsquo;t show any fear in front of blacks.</p>

		<p>This would seem to be a good way to enable ethnic Latino students to learn without the inevitable confusion, interracial violence, and hostile disruptive classroom behavior that would otherwise result.</p>
<p>The fact is, though, many of the individuals with Spanish surnames who have migrated from Latin American and Caribbean nations are Spanish speaking &#8220;Blacks&#8221;.</p>

<p>Not a bad idea. How about making historically black colleges our first target?</p>
<p>&#8220;How about making mayors and others with private funds establish private schools in which they can mete out preferential treatment to their hearts&rsquo; content?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another good one. Let&rsquo;s tell this to the Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and the NAACP.</p>
<p>Looks like there is a silver lining to the Mexican invasion after all. A certain group of people&rsquo;s chickens are coming home to roost.</p>

		<p>This is a bit rich. There&rsquo;s been 40 years of &#8216;no whites need apply&rsquo;, with these &#8216;diversity&rsquo; programs, in both public and private, and not once have we read the phrase in print, outside of AmRen. Here we do have it in print, but not in regards to whites but concerning the &#8216;some are more equal than others&rsquo; chosen ones. </p>

<p>Not in Los Angeles. Most Hispanics here are some variation of Mestizo, with some being on the white/European/Spanish-looking end of the spectrum and others who look very Indian/Aztec/Mayan.</p>

		<p>This reporter better watch her mouth and what she writes, because her brainwashing has only included blacks and she&rsquo;s just apt to incite even more mestizo on black violence than what is occurring right now.  They&rsquo;re even killing each other in racial attacks, if one or the other happens into the wrong neighborhood.</p>
<p>It is expected by many that California will collapse economically before every other state, and from the existing information right now there&rsquo;s every reason to believe that&rsquo;s going to prove true.  The result will be out-of-control fighting between blacks and browns.</p>
<p>I find it amazing that, in the face of numerous obvious failures of multiculturalism, the controlling authority and other politicians are still pretending that we are blessed with diversity.  They recite the usual diversity platitudes daily in front of the T.V. cameras, while the headline of the newspaper in the rack behind them screams something about a school, jail, or prison, lockdown, because of racial rioting, and another story might relate how three blacks were killed just for being in a Hispanic neighborhood, while another story might describe a mestizo protest march that was against celebrating a black holiday when Cinco de Mayo was ignored.</p>
<p>I truly believe the politicians in California firmly believe they can control the populace no matter what happens, and if they do, there are no greater fools on the earth today.  I just wonder if they understand that the US isn&rsquo;t able to control the people in Iraq and Afghanistan once they all start fighting, and every military man so far has admitted that.</p>
<p>The only chance for California or the rest of this country is to partition it off according to race, peaceably, to avoid large scale bloodshed.  </p>
<p>But that would be the intelligent thing to do, and when have we observed any kind of intelligent thought from politicians or the media?   The controllers of this society would have to admit the failure of multiculturalism, and they would rather die than do that.  They&rsquo;re still babbling like fools about the rainbow utopia.</p>

The marxist/leftists created the idea of diversity as a euphemism for displacing whites. The hispanics have picked up on this concept only they use the word diversity to include the displacement of blacks as well.</p>
<p>The call for diversity by blacks will only ensure that blacks remain at the bottom.</p>

		<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m mistaken but wouldn&rsquo;t such a policy also adversely impact whites?  Oh yeah, I forgot; whites were ethnically cleansed from Watts years ago.  Besides, it&rsquo;s perfectly alright to discriminate against whites, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>Antonio Villaraigosa is a former member of the Chicano supremacist organization MEChA, whose slogan is &#8220;Everything for our race. Everything outside the race, nothing&#8221;.  Villaraigosa has never repudiated their views.  Any non-Latino who voted for that man is getting what he deserves.  And I bet a lot of blacks voted for him.  He&rsquo;s a Democrat, after all.</p>
<p>La Raza is generally promoted by the media as a more moderate organization than MEChA, but La Raza funded the MEChA chapter at Georgetown University.  Soon they will have one of their own in the Supreme Court.  Imagine if a white judge belonged to an organization that provided funding for a local chapter of the Aryan Nations.  Would that person have a chance of getting appointed to the Supreme Court?<br>

<p>S.L. Cain, AHHHHH, LOST ANGELSLESS was my exact sentiments too! I can&rsquo;t believe that any city in this once great nation would name a school after a guy who played a role that practically placed a so-called comical twist on the effeminization of White malehood/manhood. I becha 1000 dollars that the Japanese are sitting back and laughing at what the United States is gonna look like within 20 years after the Metizos take it over.  </p>
