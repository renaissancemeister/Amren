<h1>A Day at the Beach in South Korea</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>coolstuff.floristone.com, March 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>These pictures of a beach in South Korea speak for themselves!</p>
<p>UPDATE: I thought these pictures were orignally from a beach in China but a reader who I&rsquo;ll call TF was kind enough to point that this is Haeundae Beach in Busan, South Korea.</p>
<p>Here is quote from Wikipedia, &#8220;During the summer time, and especially on weekends, the area becomes a vertiable wall of humanity with more than 100,000 people packed in on a narrow, one mile strip of sand.&#8221;</p>
<p>More information about Haeundae Beach at Wikipedia. I can&rsquo;t imagine the beaches in China!</p>

<p>On the other hand, I bet crime is virtually nonexistent at this beach. The strong ethnic homogeneity and the Korean penchant for order probably go a long way toward making this beach extremely safe.</p>

		<p>Yes, but don&rsquo;t all these people improve the economy?  Aren&rsquo;t we all better off when more sports utility vehicles, roads, shopping malls and fast-food restaurants are built?  Our government and the Wall Street Journal tell us that we will all benefit if we can just keep importing more and more people into the USA.  </p>
<p>I wonder if there are other things in life that make it enjoyable, besides money?</p>

		<p>Before current economic conditions came down on us, this is what my own beach resort town looked like for several months of the year. No big deal here or there. Cudahy, Calif. I once read had the densest population of any small city in the early 70s 100,000 people in 1 square mile.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s most fascinating is not so much how crowded the beach is but how they manage to color coordinate the beach umbrellas.  Cultural differences indeed.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry, the advocates of unending mass immigration are doing their best to make sure we get just as overcrowded as South Korea.  We just won&rsquo;t get the matching beach umbrellas.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s not about mindsets, philosophy, or groupthink. It&rsquo;s about TOO DAMN MANY PEOPLE!</p>
<p>There WE are, Americans!  Take a good look, folks. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll be in another couple of generations!  We&rsquo;re heading on a collision course straight for it.  Maybe  we won&rsquo;t see it ourselves, but our grandchildren will. We&rsquo;re being pushed there by our insane immigration policies and our greedy businesses, avid for &#8220;growth&#8221; at all costs.  Wow! Just think of all the profits to be made off all those consumers. All that humanity! All that purchasing power! Think of all the credit cards, gasoline, toiletpaper and toothpaste they must need! Enough to make you drool.</p>
<p>So there it is   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s what it looks like, America. That&rsquo;s what growth, growth, growth gives you.  Coming soon to a beach near you!</p>

		<p>Ah.. the crowed beaches in Asia.. remind me of Hainan Island when all the well to do Chinese hit the sand&hellip;  of course though they are crowded they are quite happy.. after all they are all chinese..</p>
<p>Back in America, with the soup bowl of Islam, Jews, Christians, Whites, Blacks, Fundamentalist, Baptists, Catholics, Mormons, Mexicans and own and own.. all fighting to force their view on the rest..  we have fights, hundreds of laws to keep order, security, police, rules and regulations&hellip;  </p>
<p>I would imagine Whites could be crowed like that on a beach of they were of one mind like American White&rsquo;s were before we were infected with the White Ruling Elite&rsquo;s disease called multiculturalism and affirmative equality.</p>
<p>Of course the White Man&rsquo;s sport today is to ridicule other cultures and people since he has destroyed and neglected his own.</p>
<p>Oh.. for the day the White Man will take charge of his life and not direct his energy and shortcomings and cowardice on the rest of the world, but on his OWN country and culture.</p>
<p>The White Man perishes for the lack of Leadership and Courage.</p>

______________</p>
<p>Well, being pro-white doesn&rsquo;t always have to mean anti-[other race].  It means you favor the white race.  It isn&rsquo;t necessarily white supremacism&hellip;depends on who you&rsquo;re talking to.</p>
<p>I think of this site as a site that points out the differences in the races, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.  Isn&rsquo;t it funny how people who are pro-diversity want to deny any differences?  Prime example of double-speak, double-think.</p>
<p>Blacks can be pro-black and it&rsquo;s okay.  Asians can be pro-Asian and it&rsquo;s okay.  But a white being pro-white?  Outrageous!  That&rsquo;s hate, that&rsquo;s racism  &mdash;  see the hypocrisy?</p>

		<p>To be fair, it does look like some sort of festival. Its also not unusual to see people crowded into small beaches on Crete. Korea&rsquo;s one of the most densely populated nations in the world after all, 45 million people in an area smaller than Texas.</p>

<p>No!  The point of including this story on AmRen is not to chastise South Koreans, who, by-and-large are very successful.  The main point is to illustrate the problems with overpopulation.  America used to have wide open spaces which not only inspired, but imparted a sense of peace and tranquility, providing spiritual healing.  Because of massive immigration, that is quickly changing.  When I was a kid, nearly all the Western states except California were more-or-less empty.  You would drive over a mountain and see a huge valley with no houses at all.  That has all changed because massive immigration into California has caused Whites to flee to the surrounding states, Californicating them.  Now all those wilderness states (Montanan to New Mexico, etc.) look just like California   &mdash;   endless suburbs, strip malls, fast-food restaurants, roads, cement, chain-link fences, etc.  DO WE REALLY WANT TO LIVE LIKE THOSE KOREANS?  WILL YOUR CHILDREN BE HAPPIER WHEN THE USA POPULATION REACHES 1 BILLION PEOPLE?</p>

<p>I would rather be on a beach with 10,000 Koreans than 10 blacks.</p>
<p>Side note:  Most Asian people I know use lots of sunscreen and avoid the sun.  They want to keep their skin as light as possible.</p>

<p>Nonsense. I suppose &#8220;offense&#8221; is largely in the eye of the beholder. If you&rsquo;re offended, you&rsquo;re just being too touchy.  </p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t meant to be offensive to Koreans. It isn&rsquo;t &#8220;poking fun&#8221; at anyone. And it certainly IS relevant to issues that concern Amren. Culture and  high achievements have nothing to do with it.  In this case, it&rsquo;s about the results of over-population. This is what the USA will look like by the end of this century. Is this how we want to be?  We have every good reason to be concerned.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there&rsquo;s a simple explanation for that &#8220;color co-ordination of umbrellas&#8221; that some have admired.  It&rsquo;s due to various companies being granted concessions to different sections of the beach; each of the companies having its own umbrellas   &mdash;   which they rent.  You can&rsquo;t find a spot on the beach wihout paying for it.  You see the same in Europe.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So there it is  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s what it looks like, America. That&rsquo;s what growth, growth, growth gives you. Coming soon to a beach near you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Economic growth is the battle cry of the elitist greed mongers in the US.  No growth means no happy face logos on anything.  Not one of the brilliant, so-called elites have taken into consideration that it is impossible to continually &#8220;grow,&#8221; but maintain a stable population.</p>
<p>God forbid that a country would dare to keep a small, homogeneous, consistent,  sustainable population that creates jobs ONLY for its people, has an agricultural base that is designed ONLY to feed its own people, and doesn&rsquo;t care if its economic base grows at all.  Lack of growth in a sane society does not mean destruction.  It means sustainability.  Constant never ending growth, within a limited space like the earth, equates to destruction eventually.</p>
<p>Greed mongers do not want to live simple happy lives.  They would, in fact, hate such an existence.  They must have money, power, and all that goes with nuturing a sick ego.<br>

		<p>&#8220;There they are, all like sardines in a can. The groupthink Asian mindset versus our individualistic European one.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>People who see this in terms of culture or racial traits completely miss the point. We would look exactly like that too   &mdash;   if we had a billion people (which we soon will!).</p>
<p>In given the multiculty menagerie that we have assembled here   &mdash;    and with that kind of density, the USA would look a lot less peaceful, orderly, and civilized than Korea. I&rsquo;m sure of it.  Put all those blacks and Hispanics, Arabs and Somalis, etc&hellip; together on a crowded beach, jammed against each other, and it would be the makings of a riot.</p>
<p>We Americans like to boast of our national traits of freedom, independence, and &#8220;rugged individuality&#8221; as something that are somehow inherent to our culture. They are not. They are a function of the spacious conditions in which we have lived.</p>
<p>These are traits that are typical of an uncrowded continent with an open frontier, where there was plenty of space for rugged individualists. In any very crowded, highly organized society (anywhere!) there is no room for a rugged individualist doing his own thing. In very densely populated lands where you have people packed together cheek by jowl, you inevitably HAVE TO have many more rules regulating evey smallest aspect of behavior in order to make life tolerable for all. Otherwise, life would be chaotic; it would be hell. On the other hand, on the open frontier, where you live 20 miles from your nearest neighbor, you can pretty much do as you please without bothering anyone.  Nobody cares. Thus, personal liberty is greater where population pressure is less. But you don&rsquo;t have a lot of personal liberty where people are stepping on each other&rsquo;s toes.</p>
<p>Please understand that this isn&rsquo;t a matter of culture, genetics, or race;  this is simply a matter of population density. We will look like that picture too   &mdash;   although probably much worse.</p>
<p>But we can still choose.  Do we want to look like that? Or do we want to preserve our precious personal space and liberty?  We can&rsquo;t have it both ways.  So far, nobody is making such conscious choices. Nobody is asking such questions (on a national level) or making such plans. We&rsquo;re just lurching ahead, taking it year by year, without thinking about where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>That picture is where we&rsquo;re going!</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t see this as a criticism of Koreans at all.  My first though was that it reminded me of the Munchen Oktoberfest, 10,000 drunk Germans in one tent and no violence.  It takes a highly civilized people to recognize the need for social harmony and act accordingly.  Contrast these Koreans with the Moslems who trample one another on pilgrimage to Mecca, or the Latin Americans and their soccer stampedes.</p>
