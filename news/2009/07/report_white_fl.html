			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joanna Sugden, Times of London, July 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White parents are pulling their children out of schools where they are outnumbered by ethnic minority pupils, according to a report that paints a picture of growing segregation in schools in some parts of England.</p>
<p>The Institute of Community Cohesion studied 13 local areas and questioned parents from places such as Bristol, Bolton, Sunderland, Oldham and Blackburn.</p>
<p>It found that where schools were more mono-cultural parents of all ethnicities preferred to send their children to the school where pupils were most like them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We heard strong evidence of &#8216;white flight&rsquo; in some areas,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Middle class parents  &mdash;  who tend to be white  &mdash;  were also removing their children from schools with growing ethnic minority populations because they didn&rsquo;t want them to stand out, the reports authors said.</p>
<p>The report concluded: &#8220;Despite the fact that most people we spoke to in focus groups wanted their children to have a mixed education. Parental choice tended to push people to what they saw as the safe option, where children with similar backgrounds went.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nick Johnston, one of the authors of the report and a policy director at the iCoCo said parents didn&rsquo;t want their child to be the odd ones out. &#8220;People don&rsquo;t mind a diverse school but what they do mind is their kid being in a visible minority in a school. This trend has increased in the last few years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Councils should consider using lotteries to increase school diversity, he added.</p>
<p>ICoCo was set up in 2005 to promote community relations and research cohesion.</p>
<p>In one school in Blackburn, once the number of non-white pupils rose above 60 per cent, white parents began saying they did not want their children to feel different.</p>
<p>At another unnamed school 85 per cent of the pupils were white British at the end of 2005. During the next two terms pupils from 15 to 20 Somali families joined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many white parents reacted negatively, arguing that their children were being disadvantaged by large numbers of non-English speakers. By September 2006, 60 white children had been removed from the school .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the percentage of black and minority ethnic pupils rose to 45 per cent. But many white families stayed,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Researchers found evidence of pupils of different ethnicities not socialising even when sharing classrooms and playgrounds.<br/>

		<p>If you want to see how much diversity has taken over England take a look at the Beijing closing ceremony, which I have linked below, in which the Olympic torch was passed from Beijing to London.  This is something I think everyone on here should take a moment to watch.  I could barely get through it because I was so embarrassed that this was a white country&rsquo;s way of celebrating it&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<p>Better yet, I have two links below.  The first one shows the production China put on in Athens when the torch was passed to Beijing.  The second one shows the &#8220;production&#8221; England put on when the torch was passed from Beijing to London.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe it when I watched it.  I had never been so ashamed and embarrassed to be white.</p>
<p>China celebrates it&rsquo;s heritage and culture with pride:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWY9b4HM_I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWY9b4HM_I</a></p>
<p><br/>
England &#8220;celebrates&#8221; it&rsquo;s &#8220;heritage&#8221;  with multiculturalism and modernism:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvS2WoQd1og" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvS2WoQd1og</a></p>
<p>After watching this I fully understand why white parents in England want their kids far away from diversity.</p>

		<p>If you leave your kids in a school with a sizable black population you are cheating them out of a decent education and also putting them at risk. <br/>
here is an essay from a teacher who tells it like it is</p>

		<p>Something I noticed about Dixie in the 60s is still true in modern Britain. Both black integrationists and white segregationists are motivated by the same impulse; neither want to be around blacks. Since blacks dislike black culture, why do they expect whites to like it? Since blacks gravitate towards white-run societies, Europe should send its blacks back to Africa and promise to re-colonize the place if asked nicely. Everyone wins!</p>

		<p>Soon they will outlaw it. You watch. It is just a matter of time. And if white parents start homeschooling in the UK because of this, they will outlaw that too! They are already working on outlawing homeschooling in the USA for the same reason. It is a known fact that homeschoolers are almost all white! </p>

<p>Imagine that!</p>
<p>Is there anybody but a dull-witted academic who wouldn&rsquo;t know that without having a study?</p>
<p> In multicultural nightmares they don&rsquo;t socialize with anyone but their own, and where the areas in which they live are richly multicultural nobody really trusts anybody either, even those of the same tribe.</p>
<p>Another &#8220;study&#8221; told us that.</p>

		<p>When did Whites the world over, and the English, become so cowardly and pathetic? All those warriors and fighters we had down through the centuries were all for naught? They would be aghast to see the condition of the White race today. Maybe we gave too much to others while neglecting our own racial family?  I believe it is called altruism which was meant to do for one&rsquo;s own racial kin, but then it was hijacked and bestowed upon all BUT their own racial kin.</p>

<p>What a lie and pathetic laugh!  They just don&rsquo;t want their children harassed, beaten and raped.</p>
<p>The British government has failed in its primary duty to protect its citizens.  It has brought them - in large numbers inside their borders.  Naturally, the British people are trying to move away from the worst zones out of basic survival instinct.</p>
<p>I just wonder how long it will be before the government realizes their errors and fatal failure?</p>

		<p>Welcome to our world; the jackbooted thugs in the justice department are going to make everything OK in the USA! By God, with enough busing, threats, quotas, and Heaven knows what else; we will all sit around the campfire and sing Kumbaya. Darn those white people, they all bailed out of the inner cities and into the boondocks. </p>
<p>Having lived through this, I&rsquo;m not sure what your options are in England, but this is what tend to happen in the US. Once a school has a minority population over 15%, this becomes a tipping point. You can move, you can send junior to a private school, or contact the HSLDA about homeschooling. I went to a high school that was 75% black and they kind of created a school within a school to retain the white students. We may have been on the same school grounds, but we weren&rsquo;t in many of the same classes. By the time I graduated high school, the district was 70% black and there was no meaningful way to &#8220;integrate&#8221;. </p>
<p>Public Schools in the US are paid for &#8220;Butts in the seats&#8221;, not for performance. You tend to get performance out of a public school when the students are VERY predominantly white or asian, the families are intact, the kids are not scared to death to go to school and their is a sense of pride in the community. Oh yea, it also helps to be located somewhere that makes it impossible to bus in minority kids (Millikin vs. Bradley).  </p>
<p>You will not find this anywhere on the internet. But what I am telling you here happened in 1970. The class that was due to graduate in 1972 from a high school in South Carolina threatened to drop out en masse if busing was rammed down their throats and they were split up to comply with an unconstitutional ruling. The school district backed down and allowed them them to graduate as a class. This kind of action would have made national news and may well have set off an number of &#8220;wildcat strikes&#8221;. Most of these students were from pretty prominent families and would have had the means to complete high school by alternate means. A couple of years later, this was slammed back into place on students matriculating from middle to high school.</p>
<p>To back up Bill #4&rsquo;s point: Before 1968 and the Green vs. New Kent County case, the NAACP could do little about housing patterns. They began pressing for integration by cherry picking the few bright black kids and sending them to the local all white elementary. These kids would shine for a brief period and then back to reality. Any of the white kids who complained would get shipped to the principal&rsquo;s office and threatened with suspension or worse. By the mid 1970&rsquo;s, it was so bad in my school district that the schools were using &#8220;Discipline quota&rsquo;s&#8221; so that they were punishing the kids &#8220;equally&#8221;. Tyrone would have to punch his teacher in the face to go see the principal while little Mary would get the same treatment for dropping her pencil on the floor. I could see this as a precursor to the Zero Tolerance nonsense that is rampant in schools today. </p>
<p>For those readers in Great Britain, I&rsquo;m not sure what your options are. If push comes to shove, get your Visas ready and take a look at somewhere like Wyoming or North Dakota. Yes, it is brutally cold, but that tends to keep the riff-raff out. </p>

		<p>The establishment left has a wonderful way of blaming whites for their own victimization.   The proper tern for what is happening is &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221;  and it&rsquo;s a war-crime.   Another example from the story about Facebook going ghetto: &#8220;The people there are more likely to be brown or black and to have a set of values that terrifies white society.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s not their bad behavior that&rsquo;s the problem, you see,  it&rsquo;s those cowardly whites racist reaction to it.  They might have used the word &#8220;disgusts&#8221; or &#8220;sickens&#8221; or the phrase &#8220;that whites find morally repellent&#8221; but that implies moral doubt about black and brown behavior, it&rsquo;s much safer to make it about white emotions.  </p>
<p>It should be remembered  that the UK is still over 90% white -  their troubles have just begun.   An interesting fact is that the black population is between 2.5-3% but black males make up about 17% of those incarcerated (about 25% for females).   Apparently the evil, racist American justice system has somehow reached across the sea and forced the British to lock up innocent blacks.   </p>

		<p>A couple of comments.</p>
<p>In the northern UK cities of Bolton, Sunderland, Oldham and Blackburn, the &#8220;blacks&#8221; that whites are trying avoid are probably asian - probably Pakistani.</p>
<p>Bill at 8:42 PM on July 10: &#8220;Since blacks dislike black culture, why do they expect whites to like it? Since blacks gravitate towards white-run societies&hellip;&#8221; Are you sure about this? It seems to me that blacks are actually quite proud of what they perceive to be their culture, such as it is. Surely blacks gravitate towards whites because, deep down, they know they need the prosperity that whites create - that&rsquo;s why they resent us so much.<br/>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;.here is an essay from a teacher who tells it like it is&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That essay is also the main feature of this month&rsquo;s AmRen &#8216;newspaper.&rsquo;  I also worked in a majority black school for nine years and cannot disagree with one single item the teacher writes about.</p>
<p>Mary Menko is already being excoriated for posting this essay.  I read through a lot of the comments as well  &mdash;   many written by those who have never set foot in a black neighborhood, let alone taught in a black school  &mdash;  and at a safe distance from blacks, of course.  Some pontificate that there needs to be a &#8216;change&rsquo; to the system so blacks can succeed.  I would ask them:  What hasn&rsquo;t been tried in the past 40 years?  &mdash;  and at monstrous expense.  The latest &#8216;change&rsquo; (NCLB) has already proved to be a massive failure.  Gee, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>This frosts me in a way few other things do. </p>
<p>Even Marty himself notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Certainly, this post is the most extreme essay I&rsquo;ve ever posted and, indeed, I feel its position is too extreme and broad-brushed&hellip;</p>
<p>How about some specific examples Marty?  What is your experience teaching in a black school such that you can make that pronouncement?</p>
<p>Which program would you implement to close the achievement gap?  How would you deal with out of control black behavior?  How would you react when you are told that YOU are the problem, not them?</p>
<p>There is no Holy Grail that will close the achievement gap because (as Professor Ruston notes) &#8216;instruction does not improve IQ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As for the pathological behavior, there is no cure (as the British are finding out). </p>
<p>To all those who still stupidly believe that black failure is due to living in an oppressive White culture, I would invite you to substitute in a black-majority school for one week (and I doubt you&rsquo;d last that long).</p>
<p>Some of the most hard-core racial realists that I know are former Teach for America interns  &mdash;  many have done a 180 turn when it comes to blacks and are profoundly racist against NAMs.  </p>
<p>They found out that everything they&rsquo;d been taught about blacks is a lie.</p>
<p>And lastly, Howard posts:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Public Schools in the US are paid for &#8216;Butts in the seats&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and in California it is worse than that.  The schools are now paid for period-to period attendance.  What that means is that teachers now must take attendance each class period  &mdash;  if the kid ditches after lunch, the school isn&rsquo;t paid for that time period.</p>
<p>In the &#8216;good old days&rsquo;, teachers took attendance once a day for ADA purposes (that&rsquo;s the government payment for attendance).  This was done in the morning and was the purpose of the old homeroom or record room. After homeroom, many of the more difficult schools would unlock their gates or leave them partially  open so the kids could escape  &mdash;  the school had already put in the government-mandated attendance requirement for payment so the rest of the day didn&rsquo;t matter.  </p>
<p>The security guards were told not to stop the students who poured out of the gates.  One teacher told me the main path out of her school went directly under the principal&rsquo;s office  &mdash;  and he&rsquo;d sit in his office everyday and watch the kids leave.  Teacher and administrators approved of this because the worst behavior problems and the kids who didn&rsquo;t want to be there would leave making the rest of the day much more pleasant.</p>
<p>All of that is history now. Older teachers miss the good old days.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p><br/>
 </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, they are some of the most hard-core White racial realists I&rsquo;ve ever come across, </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Certainly, this post is the most extreme essay I&rsquo;ve ever posted and, indeed, I feel its position is too extreme and broad-brush-</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but cold weather does not keep third-worlders out, including persons from equatorial climates such as Sudanese &amp; Somalis. I live in a northern city in Canada, and we&rsquo;ve been hard hit by an influx of Somalis. Despite very long &amp; cold winters, and not particularly warm summers, they show no sign of leaving. They&rsquo;re also up in the Canadian Arctic and in Alaska, and as for the continental United States, try northern states with cold winters, such as Minnesota and Maine, if you want to find Somali &#8216;refugees&rsquo;. They gravitate toward wherever white people are a majority, because this means more prosperous living conditions. The weather is not really much of a factor.</p>

		<p>The problem with the world today, is that we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s right or what is wrong. We want to be nice and help people, but we don&rsquo;t know how. Ther&rsquo;s an old word of wisdom that says &#8220;If a guy is hungry and you give him a fish, he have food for one day. Teach him to fish and he will have food for rest of his life&#8221; What happen to this knowledge? It&rsquo;s gone and forgotten.<br/>
We think we help people by giving them money, positiv criticism, affirmative action and not demanding somthing back. This is opposite of helping, plus they loose respect, and think they can do what ever with no consequences.</p>
<p>Why we have this behavior in our society is due to guidens by mother (Matris society) insted of father guidens (patriarchal society).</p>

Hope my english made sense, not my first language.<br/>

		<p>I do not know about Canada - but in the US the Somalis end up in Maine, Wisconsin and other white areas in order to diversify the population. The Federal Government refugee resettlement program does this on purpose. Having states with too high a percentage of whites means that there could be a haven for whites to run to when the race riots start.  Those states people could provide white internal refugees a place to be safe.  It could also mean areas that might try to secede - the government is hell bent on keeping the US in one piece while dispossessing whites.<br/>

		<p>Iceland is primarily white.  The nice part is, English is a second language there, though if I were to move there (not likely, though) I&rsquo;d make an attempt at learning the Icelandic language and culture.</p>
<p>Only thing wrong there is their economic situation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d actually like the weather, though&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at the voting record of the senators and reps. in Wyoming and they get all A grades for their stance against immigration and other non white takeover attempts&hellip;this is according to www.numbersusa.com of which I am a proud new member.<br/>
My own state (S.C.) also has a pretty good voting record in favor of restricted immigration and such. Go check out numbersusa.com and don&rsquo;t forget www.zasucks.com and www.sweetness-light.com&hellip;I also keep up with www.jihadwatch.com</p>

		<p>&ldquo;White Flight&rdquo; in Britain means native British surrendering their own country to black and brown invaders. But Britain is a small place. Soon there will be no where to run to.</p>
<p>THEN!!! it comes down to &#8220;WHITE FIGHT!&#8221; and we Whites are really good at it.</p>
