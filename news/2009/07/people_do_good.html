			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Theriault, AP, July 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s fans celebrated the anti-apartheid icon&rsquo;s 91st birthday Saturday by emulating him with good deeds, reading to the blind, distributing blankets to the homeless or refurbishing homes for AIDS orphans.</p>
<p>Mandela had called on people to spend time doing good Saturday, the first Mandela Day, which his charity foundations hope will be an annual event.</p>
<p>South Africans collected clothing for poor children, painted schools, planted trees near Mandela&rsquo;s boyhood home in eastern South Africa, and renovated a building in downtown Johannesburg for people left homeless by a fire.</p>
<p>Mandela stepped down after serving one term as president  &mdash;  the first black South African to hold the post. Since 1999, he has devoted himself to such causes as fighting AIDS and poverty and championing the rights of children.</p>
<p>At a Mandela Day concert in New York on Saturday, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, Aretha Franklin and others are to perform for the benefit of Mandela&rsquo;s AIDS foundation.</p>
<p>Mandela Day organizers encouraged people around the world to devote at least a minute for each of the 67 years Mandela campaigned against apartheid to community service.</p>
<p>In Soweto, Thembekile &#8220;Prisca&#8221; Tshabalala invited community members to play with disabled children at her year-old Nkanyezi Stimulation park, a cheery playground with seesaws and swings designed to accommodate children in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The regular volunteers at a Johannesburg animal shelter called CLAW sang &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; for Mandela before getting to work Saturday. Children from poor communities volunteer to care for and walk the dogs at CLAW&rsquo;s shelter, and adults donate time to help the children with their school work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the projects celebrating Mandela Day in South Africa underlined how much work remains to be done in a country proud of ending apartheid peacefully, but plagued by poverty, stubborn inequalities, and AIDS  &mdash;  some 5.2 million South Africans were living with HIV last year  &mdash;  more than in any other country in the world.</p>
<p>President Jacob Zuma, the current leader of Mandela&rsquo;s African National Congress party, paid a birthday visit to Mandela at his home in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Zuma was joined by party leaders and Mandela&rsquo;s family, including wife Graca Machel and former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, as well as former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and former Tanzanian President Hassan Mwinyi, according to a statement from the ANC.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zuma said Mandela taught the nation &#8220;reconciliation and forgiveness and we learned from him that you achieve personal freedom and inner peace if you release hatred and bitterness from your heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen Zille, leader of the ANC&rsquo;s main opponent, the Democratic Alliance, served at a soup kitchen in Cape Town.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent years, an increasingly frail Mandela has largely retired from public life and stressed that if his legacy is to live, others must take up his causes. His Mandela Foundation, which houses some of his archives and supports community building projects, has switched from a logo featuring his face to one featuring his hands, reflecting his desire to shift the focus from himself to the work ahead.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a good deed you can do to commemorate what good ol Nelson stood for:  You can find a black person in South Africa who disagrees with the government and splash gasoline around him and put a burning tire on him and yell traitor! </p>
<p>Ah, what an apostle of peace Nelson is. After all, Michael Jackson and Bono hailed him as a humanitarian. </p>

		<p>Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s about par for the course. We have the Comrade King holiday in America, so I guess it&rsquo;s about time their most famous Commie got his own special commemoration. But to truly keep with the spirit of the occasion, they need to follow Comrade Mandela&rsquo;s example and do someone else in.</p>

		<p>So is the average poster supposed to be pro-apartheid? Gosh, I wonder why the movement isn&rsquo;t catching on. Apartheid was completely unsustainable and a disaster for whites. By all means, support apartheid so that what happened to whites in south africa happens EVERYWHERE.</p>

		<p>Mandela Facts: Creation of the Devil-god</p>
<p>Revered and worshiped by the world, the sick, sick liberal world.</p>
<p>Mandela had planned on planting bombs at the Johannesburg main train station (Park Station) and according to Dr Percy Yutar, the prosecutor who was tasked to nail him, Mandela &amp; co had &ldquo;enough explosives to blow up the entire Johannesburg.&rdquo; <br/>
The Rivonia treason trail commenced, and Mandela was charged inter alia with:<br/>
·	recruiting persons for training in the preparation and use of explosives and in guerilla warfare for the purpose of violent revolution and committing acts of sabotage <br/>
·	conspiring to commit the aforementioned acts and to aid foreign military units when they invaded the Republic, <br/>
·	acting in these ways to further the objects of communism <br/>
·	soliciting and receiving money for these purposes from sympathizers in Algeria, Ethiopia, Liberia, Nigeria, Tunisia, and elsewhere. <br/>
The full list of munitions and charges read as follows:<br/>
• One count under the South African Suppression of Communism Act No. 44 of 1950, charging that the accused committed acts calculated to further the achievement of the objective of communism;<br/>
• One count of contravening the South African Criminal Law Act (1953), which prohibits any person from soliciting or receiving any money or articles for the purpose of achieving organized defiance of laws and<br/>
country; and<br/>
• Two counts of sabotage, committing or aiding or procuring the commission of the following acts:<br/>
1) The further recruitment of persons for instruction and training, both within and outside the Republic of South Africa, in:<br/>
(a) the preparation, manufacture and use of explosives &mdash; for the purpose of committing acts of violence and destruction in the aforesaid Republic, <br/>
(the preparation and manufacture of explosives, <br/>
according to evidence submitted, included 210&rsquo;000 hand grenades, 48&rsquo;000 anti-personnel mines, 1&rsquo;500 time devices, 144 tons of ammonium nitrate, 21.6 tons of aluminum powder and one ton of black powder);</p>
<p>(b) the art of warfare, including guerrilla warfare, and military training generally for the purpose in the aforesaid Republic;<br/>
(ii) Further acts of violence and destruction, (this includes 193 counts of terrorism committed between 1961 and 1963);<br/>
(iii) Acts of guerrilla warfare in the aforesaid Republic;<br/>
(iv) Acts of assistance to military units of foreign countries when involving the aforesaid Republic;<br/>
(v) Acts of participation in a violent revolution in the aforesaid Republic, whereby the accused, injured, damaged, destroyed, rendered useless or unserviceable, put out of action, obstructed, with or endangered:<br/>
• (a) the health or safety of the public;<br/>
• (b) the maintenance of law and order;<br/>
• (c) the supply and distribution of light, power or fuel;<br/>
• (d) postal, telephone or telegraph installations;<br/>
• (e) the free movement of traffic on land; and<br/>
• (f) the property, movable or immovable, of other persons or of the state.<br/>

1963-1964, Indictment.<br/>
The main charge was High Treason, at the time an offence that carried the death penalty. Mandela was convicted but amazingly enough escaped the death sentence. In time, this act of mercy on the part of the White South African establishment would prove to be their undoing. Dr Yutar did his level best to have Mandela executed, but pressure from the National Party government convinced the judge to sentence him to life imprisonment instead.<br/>
Had Mandela been hanged as he rightly should have, the international media driven by Soviet propagandists would have been denied the chance of creating the fantastical myth they erected around this highly immoral, thoroughly evil man.<br/>
Mandela the true Marxist terrorist:<br/>
During the mid eighties, international pressure on the Nationalist government mounted steadily. In response to the endless din, former president PW Botha made Mandela an offer - renounce violence, bloodshed and terrorism and we will release you immediately and unconditionally. Once a terrorist, always a terrorist it seems, so Mandela declined the offer. It made perfect sense - Mandela was leading a royal life in Victor Verster, and tactically he was worth much more to the Marxist cause inside prison than out.<br/>
A few short years later, President Botha suffered a stroke under extremely suspicious circumstances (some believe he was poisoned or else chemically incapacitated by doctors acting under the aegis of the FW De Klerk treason gang, who had been paid millions of dollars to deliver White South Africa to the wolves.<br/>
De Klerk wasted little time in initiating the capitulation of the mighty old South Africa, and on 2 February 1990 announced the unbanning of the ANC, PAC and SA Communist Party. On 11 February Mandela himself was released. Pandora&rsquo;s box had been opened and instantaneously political violence flared up to shocking new levels. The ANC embarked on making South Africa &ldquo;ungovernable&rdquo;. Democratically elected black town councilors were murdered, their houses razed. Black policemen were killed like flies, accused of being &ldquo;impimpi&rdquo; - agents of the White government.<br/>
During the 1992 funeral of an ANC operative killed in political violence, Mandela was filmed singing a revolutionary song, the lyrics of which goes &ldquo;kill the Whites, kill the Boers&rdquo;. You can view the Youtube video here.</p>

After 1994, the black onslaught on whites drastically increased in number and brutal savagery. More than 3000 white farmers and their dependants and more than 35&rsquo;000 other white South Africans were already brutally murdered since 1994. <br/>
Add to this massacre and undeniable white genocide:<br/>
-	All that happened between 1960 and 1982 that are not reported,<br/>
-	All that remained hidden by the traitorous NP government and their collaborators in the media and churches, prior to 1994,  <br/>
-	All that was and is hidden by the current black government and their collaborators since 1994,<br/>
-	The resultant revolutionary change of a once law abiding and ordered White Western country into yet another failed black African state riddled with crime, corruption, savagery, decay and growing poverty, <br/>
where the average day presents:  <br/>
137 	reported rapes, <br/>
  63 	murders, <br/>
  73 	attempted murders, <br/>
176 	armed robberies, <br/>
670 	house breakings, and <br/>
35	car-jackings.</p>
<p>This Devil-god Mandela is truly worthy of all the praise, admiration and sucking up he receives from his white liberal, IQ and reality dysfunctional minions and from his international following of blacks!</p>
<p>CONCLUSION<br/>
Is there anywhere in the civilized world where an agreement between parties would be deemed legally binding, where the one party (whites) where coerced, blackmailed, threatened, attacked, and acting under totalitarian undue influence, by the other party (blacks and international liberals and communists)? </p>
<p>The new South Africa is a political, economical and social farce and the greatest land theft and massacre of a white civilization ever in the recorded history of man, funded and orchestrated by the evil money forces of the West, assisted by the communist forces of the East and profiting from it by the blacks of Africa. <br/>
They are an unholy alliance between equally evil and undeserving parties.</p>
<p>This unholy alliance is crawling towards the Western White World all over the globe.</p>
<p>Watch out white man, they are coming to you, your country and town soon!<br/>
Follow the money and observe the total rot that sets in where the unholy alliance touches, settles and starts feasting on your flesh!<br/>
Is your pacifist &ldquo;make believe&rdquo; world of consumer luxury and content worth the future and heritage of your children, loved ones, your people and your race?</p>
<p>Wake up, wake those around you up, stand and work together and save the white race!<br/>

		<p>One could no doubt spend hours picking out the little biases and assumptions contained in this article, especially if one contrasted the treatment of Mandela with that given to, say, William Shockley or any current-day race realist. </p>
<p>If mandela had been treated the same way, descriptions of him as a &#8220;former terrorist&#8221; would have been sprinkled throughout this piece, or perhaps guilt-by-association references to his connections with shady characters. None of that is found in this article, since it is an AP piece. </p>
<p>Much, for example, is made of the fact that Mandela is SA&rsquo;s &#8220;first black president&#8221; without mentioning that the whole concept of the presidency and other systems of government in SA were introduced by those &#8220;oppressive&#8221; whites in the first place. </p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the claim that SA is plagued by &#8220;stubborn&#8221; inequalities. If it said &#8220;inherent&#8221; inequalities it would be the truth, unpalatable though it may be to modern sensitivities.</p>
