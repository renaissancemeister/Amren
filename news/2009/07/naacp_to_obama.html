<h1>Obama Tells NAACP More Yet to Do on Civil Rights</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Elliott, AP, July 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Saying that civil rights leaders from decades past paved the way for his election as the nation&rsquo;s first black commander in chief, President Barack Obama paid homage to the NAACP and advised members that their work remains unfinished.</p>
<p>Obama traced his historic rise to power to the vigor and valor of black civil rights leaders, telling the nation&rsquo;s oldest civil rights organization Thursday night that their sacrifice &#8220;began the journey that has led me here.&#8221; He also prodded them to look beyond simply African-American rights as the group celebrated its 100th convention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make no mistake: The pain of discrimination is still felt in America,&#8221; the president told the friendly audience that erupted in standing applause and the occasional &#8220;Amen&#8221; during his remarks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Painting himself as the beneficiary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People&rsquo;s work, Obama cited historical figures from W.E.B. DuBois to Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King Jr. to Emmet Till to explain how the path to the presidency was cleared by visionaries.</p>
<p>Despite the racial progress exemplified by his own election, Obama said African-Americans must overcome a disproportionate share of struggles, including being more likely to suffer from many diseases and having a higher proportion of children end up in jail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama expanded his message of equal rights beyond the black communities. He said many Americans still face discrimination and suggested the NAACP  &mdash;  looking to declare a mission for its second century  &mdash;  might embrace a broader mandate in coming years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He urged parents to take a more active role, residents to pay better attention to their schools and students to aspire beyond basketball stars and rappers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Throughout his comments, Obama sought a balance, contending that the government must foster equality but individuals must take charge of their own lives. It was reminiscent of earlier Obama speeches, calling on fathers to help their children and adopting a tone that at times seemed drawn from the pulpit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, Obama said, it is not prejudice or discrimination that presents the greatest obstacles for blacks, but rather structural inequities  &mdash;  in areas such as education and health care. Still, he said discrimination persists  &mdash;  and not just for blacks  &mdash;  and chided those who may contend otherwise.<br>

								<h2>NAACP to Obama: We Want More</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Nia-Malika Henderson, The Politico, July 16, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>When President Barack Obama takes the stage here Thursday night at the NAACP&rsquo;s annual conference, he will be greeted by a base of black supporters who see him as the crowning achievement in the struggle for civil rights. Six months into his presidency, there are few signs that black support for Obama is softening.</p>
<p>Yet, many are hoping to hear from Obama something that they have yet to hear  &mdash;  specific plans to address the black agenda. Obama&rsquo;s broad approach to race has left some cold and has fueled the idea that he is punting on the issue and ignoring the specificity of the problems in the black community where, for instance, the unemployment rate is nearly 15 percent, compared to 9 percent nationwide.</p>
<p>They might be disappointed. White House aides said Obama will touch on the organization&rsquo;s accomplishments, cast himself as a beneficiary, emphasize the need for personal responsibility and talk broadly about his domestic agenda, but not unveil any specific policy.</p>
<p>NAACP President Benjamin Jealous praised Obama for several early steps in his presidency but said he wants to hear from Obama a commitment to ending discrimination in his remarks tonight, and a recognition of the work of the NAACP, celebrating its 100th anniversary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet if his remarks amount to a rah-rah speech about the NAACP, then &#8220;people will be pretty happy and then they will wake up the next day feeling empty,&#8221; Jealous said.</p>
<p>Just hours before his speech, Obama nominated the associate director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Jacqueline A. Berrien, to head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is, Barack Obama can go into some black audiences and read the phone book and people would say that&rsquo;s the best sounding phone book I have ever heard before. We don&rsquo;t want a whole lot from him, not yet at least,&#8221; said Michael Fauntroy, a public policy professor at George Mason University.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is a small and growing sentiment among some African Americans that perhaps we need a more forward and overt conversations about some things. He is taking the approach that in dealing with the economy and health care that he is dealing with black issues, but there are some other issues that have a unique impact on African Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fauntroy added that the Obama&rsquo;s emphasis on personal responsibility is not enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not everything can be addressed through talk. I want to hear some policy prescriptions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not just pull up your pants. We know that already.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Rising tides will not lift all boats. Some boats are locked in and getting them out requires investment. Urban America will recover when it&rsquo;s targeted,&#8221; Jackson [Jesse Jackson Sr.] said. &#8220;I think he has opened the window for hope and opportunity, but those who have the most need, whether they are inner city blacks or whites in Appalachia, must be targeted. The banks were targeted  &mdash;  now the most unemployed need a targeted stimulus.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As Obama said, metropolitan areas can&rsquo;t be looked on as problems, but solutions. Who lives in metropolitan areas? You upgrade the education there, the transportation there, you fight the crime there. Who benefits?&#8221; said former Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think it can be listed and called the black agenda. I think it should be an agenda that can uplift people who would be left out and that includes African-Americans. You do what you need to do with it without calling it that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strategically, that kind of raceless, universal approach served Obama well in the campaign, and he was able to hold racial issues at arms length, with the implicit understanding among blacks that he couldn&rsquo;t be &#8220;the black president.&#8221; But with that tacit agreement, there were also expectations, University of Maryland professor Ron Walters said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want the agenda to be recognized but they are reluctant to press it. There is going to be a lot of listening going on to see if he begins to press aspects of this agenda,&#8221; said Walters, who ran Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s presidential campaigns. &#8220;And there&rsquo;s going to be a &#8216;where&rsquo;s the beef, come to Jesus&rsquo; meeting somewhere down the line without any concrete action.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I saw this on C-SPAN last night, at least most of it.  President Obama was literally screaming about how we need safe neighborhoods for black kids.  The only problem is that you&rsquo;re not going to get safe neighborhoods for black kids by screaming about getting better neighborhoods for black kids.  And other black kids are mostly the reason why black kids don&rsquo;t have safe neighborhoods, the NAACP saw it it that the black kids who make the neighborhood unsafe are endowed with civil rights.</p>

		<p>It sure is strange the way the lame stream media treats the NAACP. Traditionally if you coast through life, constantly pointing out peoples flaws (without acknowledging your own), without setting goals of your own (best personified in the pharse &#8220;we&rsquo;ve come a long way but there&rsquo;s still more to do&#8221;), people will use pharses like immature and irresponsible when describing you and they sure as he&rsquo;ll won&rsquo;t call you a leader. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting he mentions Emmett Till.  Apparently Till&rsquo;s body was one of the ones discarded recently by the cemetery crew that was reselling graves in Illinois.  Is it possible his people didn&rsquo;t know this when they wrote his speech?  It&rsquo;s very odd.</p>

		<p>If the messiah and his fellow black leaders would just tell it like it is to their black kin, that&rsquo;s probably the best favor he could do for them.  He should impress on them that they aren&rsquo;t behind in just this country they&rsquo;re behind in every civilized country in which they reside.</p>
<p>He should tell them them the reason they&rsquo;re not able to compete is because they don&rsquo;t have the intelligence, the ability, the determination or the work ethic.  </p>
<p>He should impress on them that proof of what he says is very obvious if one just takes a close look at Africa where there are examples of black failure everywhere.</p>
<p>In short, he should just tell them the truth.</p>

		<p>Karl Marx called civil rights &#8220;a revolution in permanence.&#8221;  Therefore, the NAACP will always think there is &#8220;more yet to do&#8221; on civil rights, even after more is done.</p>

<p>Tell me about it. You just nominated a Supreme Court judge who promotes state-sponsored discrimination against white people, passed a hate crimes bill that your own A.G. said will not protect whitey and mention Emmett Till but not one of the millions of whites (and other non-blacks) who are raped, robbed and murdered by blacks every year.</p>

<p>Whites must plan an organized relentless legaldefense against the South Africa type job replacement about to be decreed from the Smooth One. Far fetched? </p>
<p>Note the fanaticism with which he rescued financiers and pushed his megagovt healthcare plan. This guy does deliver on &#8220;promises&#8221; so God help us Europeans.</p>

When blacks say &#8216;more needs to be done&rsquo; what they mean is they need more blacks in power so they can turn the US into Zimbabwe, Rhodesia, South Africa etc.</p>

		<p>I think the President missed his calling. He did a great impersonation of a revival preacher. His inflections and dialect suddenly lost the Ivy League tone he usually has. I guess Rev. Wright&rsquo;s style made more of an impression on him than we know. While he practices no religion now, he sure can preach it.</p>

		<p>Just to make an observation on the lighter side,I couldn&rsquo;t help it but literally started laughing when I read AmRens subtitle to this article, &#8220;whitey still on the hook&#8221;. Since I have done my share of fishing, I pictured a fish helplessly flopping around, not being able to get off the hook, as really being the perfect metaphor to describe the never-ending predicament Americans are trapped in, where the so-called civil rights issues are concerned. And rest assured, it never will end, but only get worse for white Americans, for now we have a new aggrieved group in America  &mdash;  the &#8220;hispanics.&#8221;</p>

Just because blacks can&rsquo;t behave responsibly whether it be holding down a job, training or having protected sexwith others. Due to their continual irresponsibility they will always blame whitey as we are the soft target. Boy, oh Boy I hope all those pathetic white Marxist liberals will start to learn that genetics play a major part in explaining why blacks fall behind.</p>

		<p>GLENN BECK&rsquo;s show last night (July 18 shed serious light on the GOLDMAN-SACHS in our government and it&rsquo;s association with the bail outs. Go look for it. Seems that everyone involved in the treasury and the bail out scandal, were once with Goldman-Sachs.</p>

		<p> The white race attempting to deal with the black race is a no win situation. They demand, we give then they demand more and we give more. There never seems to be enough. They accuse, we cower. They attack,we run. We move away, they follow, destroy and laugh at us for doing nothing.<br>
 It is my opinion that this chain of events started when President Eisenhower ordered active duty troops against white American citizens on Sep.24, 1957.</p>

<p>________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Well, I won&rsquo;t be disappointed because as far as I am concerned, the NAACP has outlived its usefulness.  If anybody thought that the &#8220;election&#8221; of the &#8220;messiah&#8221; was gonna bring about the new millenium of &#8220;change&#8221; well, they are in for a great big disappointment!</p>
<p>American blacks are gonna have to remember that it wasn&rsquo;t them who actually propped this guy up that&rsquo;s presently in the Oval office and it will not be us that he will ultimately answer to. This president, just like the other one before him take his orders from the Trilateral Commission, the Federal Reserve board and their minions and let us not forget about the Vatican!</p>
<p>My thing is that if we american blacks really want to scream about something, let us scream about obtaining some land of our own, establishing our own institutions, getting along with one another, and leaving white people alone!  This is the only way we are going to make it in this country.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hear no more of this inane, nonsensical talk of multiculturalism and a so-called liberal &#8220;utopia&#8221; that we all know does not exist nowhere within the parimeters of North America: NEVER HAS and NEVER WILL!</p>

Bobby, (Poster #14)I read your post but could not start laughing because this is a very serious matter here in the United States!  I did like your metaphor about the forever flopping fish but let me say this:  White, satanic liberalism is the creator of this &#8220;metaphoric&#8221; fish and it&rsquo;s gonna have to be whites like yourself who destroys the very evil who created this &#8220;flopping-fish.&#8221;  You see my friend, we blacks are not in a real position to overthrow the paralyzing tenacles of white liberalism therefore, we will not be able stop its forever destructive forces on this nation!</p>
<p>I for one wish that I could single-handedly eradicate the systematic evils of white liberalism and the parasitic and dependent mentality that it has caused my race of people to have upon &#8220;benevolent&#8221; whites.  Sometimes I almost feel like going off the deep end thinking about all of this madness!</p>
<p>I do not for one minute believe that the &#8220;appointment&#8221; of the present Afro-American POTUS is gonna in no way or fashion alleviate any of the social, political, or legal maladies that this country is being torpedoed and plagued with on every hand at the present time!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take some hard-core, in-your-face, brutal truths to awaken this sleeping nation out of it state of somnolence and get it back on track.  If we don&rsquo;t wake up and very soon, Spanglish will be the primary language in 10 years and Spanish in 15   &mdash;   MOCK MY WORDS!</p>

		<p>When you are You Tube, type in &#8220;Slavery in Mauritania&#8221; Africa. This video shows, today, the Slavery that takes place, and that most Black Africans are held in Slavery, by other Blacks, and Arabs. </p>
<p>I noticed that the NAACP, and CORE were silent on this issue. </p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;..My thing is that if we american blacks really want to scream about something, let us scream about obtaining some land of our own, establishing our own institutions, getting along with one another, and leaving white people alone! This is the only way we are going to make it in this country&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>- why don&rsquo;t you work for land of your own? Or why don&rsquo;t you all just return to Africa, where there is lots of land that Blacks &#8220;own&#8221; and Whites cannot.  You can then make all the institutions you want (you have enough here already) and try to get along there.  Let us have our nation without your kind once and for all!</p>

		<p>While we are discussing what the NAACP wants for all of us in this next Century, take a look at two You Tube videos called,&#8221;Detroit Ghost Town&#8221; and &#8220;Calling All Angels&#8221;. </p>
<p>If you want to know what total dispair is, and complete destruction of a Neighborhood looks like, watch these two videos, which I first found at the Council of Conservative Citizens&rsquo; web site.</p>
<p>I think Blacks and the NAACP owe White America Reparations, for the wholesale destruction of all our Major Cities. </p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s gonna take some hard-core, in-your-face, brutal truths to awaken this sleeping nation out of it state of somnolence and get it back on track. If we don&rsquo;t wake up and very soon, Spanglish will be the primary language in 10 years and Spanish in 15  &mdash;  MOCK MY WORDS!&#8221;</p>
<p>Your wish is my command, sir.  In-your-face brutal truths coming right up, as you desire, for the next several years.</p>
<p>But, as far as turning things around, sorry, but it&rsquo;s way too late for that.</p>
<p>Non-reversal chaos is coming soon.  It&rsquo;s one of the brutal truths that is progressing nicely right now.  It will get far worse with each passing day until this nation is ruined both financially and militarily, because there will be much chaos and consternation from this point forward.</p>
<p>One of your corrupt leaders, Al Sharpton, actually called for an FBI investigation for an incident wherein a large mob of blacks set upon a peaceful white family out for a day of recreation, uttering racial slurs and supremacist boasts about how blacks now rule this country.</p>
<p>Do you think he did that because he&rsquo;s a fair, just individual, when he has kept silent for the last thirty years regarding a thousand other black on white atrocities?  I&rsquo;m afraid that isn&rsquo;t the case.  He came to life, because he knows whites are on the verge of striking back and he knows full well that will be the end of the hate whitey attacks when that happens.</p>
<p>The earth will shake from the white thunder.  You have my word on that.</p>
<p>I can grant SOME wishes, but I can&rsquo;t perform miracles.</p>
