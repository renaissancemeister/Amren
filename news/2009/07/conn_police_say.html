<h1>Conn. Police Say Possible Ritual in Theft of Body</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Cristoffersen, AP, July 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Authorities investigating the theft of a 2-year-old girl&rsquo;s body from a Connecticut cemetery said Wednesday that evidence at the crime scene points to a possible ritual. </p>
<p>Stamford Capt. Richard Conklin said investigators are looking at the crime &#8220;as a ritualistic sort of thing.&#8221; He cited beliefs such as Santeria, a Caribbean blend of West African beliefs and Catholicism, or Palo Mayombe, a religion originally from the Congo region of Africa and brought to the Americas by slaves. </p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of things point to it,&#8221; Conklin said without elaborating. </p>
<p>Two men fishing in the Passaic River on Sunday in Clifton, N.J., found the child&rsquo;s body in a bag at the shoreline. An investigation led authorities to the grave of a girl who was buried in Stamford in 2007. </p>
<p>Margarite Fernandez Olmos, a professor at Brooklyn College and co-author of the book &#8220;Creole Religions of the Caribbean,&#8221; said the body theft &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t sound like a Santeria practice.&#8221; Some practitioners of Palo Mayombe, which has several names, may use a skull, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Donna Loglisci, Stamford&rsquo;s town clerk who signed disinterment papers permitting authorities to exhume the coffin, identified the girl as Imani Joyner. The girl was called a miracle baby by doctors in a 2006 article in The Advocate of Stamford because she survived more than two years even though she was born with semi-lobar holoprosencephaly, a condition that kept her brain from developing fully. </p>
<p>&#8220;We thought the interest in this particular baby might be the background, since it was labeled a miracle baby,&#8221; Conklin said. &#8220;So that&rsquo;s why we believe this baby in particular might have been targeted and it might not be a random act. They would seek that mystic power, perceived power of it being a miracle baby.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I live in Fairfield County, and believe it or not this kind of thing is actually becoming almost common to the area.  In June, a drug bust turned up a &#8220;sacrificial rituals room&#8221; in a basement, complete with human and animal skulls.  And then just this past Friday, a family, again in Bridgeport, found two human skulls partially buried in their recently deceased father&rsquo;s grave, stuffed with bloodstained papers with peoples&rsquo; names written on them.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel enriched and energized by these &#8220;quaint&#8221; and &#8220;colorful&#8221; customs that our wonderfully &#8220;diverse&#8221; population has brought to this part of Connecticut.  I don&rsquo;t know how we ever got by without them.</p>

		<p>NJ has a constant stream of these grave robbing incidents due to our diverse, vibrant friends from Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti.  </p>

		<p>Here is an interesting book on a related subject: <br>

<p>Includes cases of ritual sacrifice from the Caribbean and Central America. Some odd cases from the USA. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t diversity wonderful?</p>

		<p>Perhaps she was never buried at all, but kept for a while as an anatomical curiosity, sold by a corrupt funeral home.  That might explain why she was found so far from the place of her supposed burial, the plot undisturbed, and her body in a plastic bag.</p>
