<h1>Is Having More Than 2 Children an Unspoken Taboo?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robin Wilson, Chronicle of Higher Education, July 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By academic standards, Rebecca R. Richards-Kortum has it made. She is a full professor of bioengineering at Rice University, runs a thriving cancer-research laboratory, and is a member of the prestigious National Academy of Engineering.</p>
<p>But with four children at home, she sometimes feels like an academic outcast. In fact, Ms. Richards-Kortum says she is most comfortable in her dual roles as professor and mother during the research trips she takes several times a year to southern Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Richards-Kortum is one of a very small number of academic women with three, four, or more children. In academe, where having even one child can slow down success, trying to manage multiple kids can be a career-stopper.</p>
<p>Women with many children are seen by their peers and supervisors as less than serious about their work in a profession that often expects nothing short of complete devotion. Even administrators who consider themselves supportive of female professors with children may question the wisdom of those with more than one or two.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>True, an academic career can be flexible  &mdash;  at least after tenure. But the dozen or so arduous years spent earning a Ph.D. and building a career makes academe one of the less friendly professions for women with children, say researchers who study the issue.</p>
<p>Graduate students have already picked up on that. In a 2006-7 study of 8,400 graduate students on nine University of California campuses, only 29 percent of the women and 46 percent of the men said they considered research universities to be family-friendly places for tenure-track professors to work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a national study of about 5,000 professors in chemistry and English, completed by researchers at Pennsylvania State University in 2002, found that female professors had an average of only .66 kids each. The average American woman by comparison, has about two children.</p>
<p>Yet another study, conducted by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Utah, found that academic women were 27 percent less likely than doctors and 17 percent less likely than lawyers to have babies. It also found that male professors fathered fewer children than their male counterparts in those other professions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Academic women, meanwhile, are well aware of the harm that having children can do to their professional lives. In the national study of English and chemistry professors, 26 percent of women  &mdash;  double the proportion of men  &mdash;  said they had fewer children than they would have liked in order to achieve academic success. &#8220;The cultural line in academe is that one child is acceptable, maybe two, but three are not,&#8221; says Marc Goulden, a Berkeley researcher who has completed several studies on academic women and children.</p>
<p>Julianna Baggott knows full well that the third child is often considered the third rail of academe. That&rsquo;s why, when she is asked how it feels to be a professor with five children, she has one word: &#8220;subversive.&#8221; Ms. Baggott&rsquo;s husband stays home to watch the kids, but that hasn&rsquo;t made her feel any more comfortable about her large brood. She displays no photos of her children in her office in Florida State University&rsquo;s English department, and she never tells colleagues that she can&rsquo;t make a meeting because of the children, who range in age from 14 to 2. &#8220;I just say, &#8216;I&rsquo;m sorry, I have a conflict,&rsquo;&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Academia assumes that a woman, once she has kids, is not going to be able to maintain her career at the same level,&#8221; says Ms. Baggott, an associate professor. She just earned tenure and has written 14 books, including six for children. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a workaholic,&#8221; she says during a cellphone interview between stops on a West Coast tour for one of her latest books, The Prince of Fenway Park (HarperCollins, 2009).</p>
<p>Some women say it is academe&rsquo;s focus on the mind, not the body, that makes being a pregnant professor  &mdash;  or one with kids  &mdash;  so unusual and unwelcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;In academia, the mind/body split is operative,&#8221; says Nicole Cooley, an associate professor of English at the City University of New York&rsquo;s Queens College and a contributor to Mama Ph.D.: Women Write About Motherhood and Academic Life (Rutgers University Press, 2008). &#8220;Academia&rsquo;s grounding in the clerical tradition means that a lot of your identity is your intellectual work, and you don&rsquo;t sully yourself with domestic arrangements and bodily things.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Women with several children say colleagues and supervisors alike are not shy about sharing their scorn over the women&rsquo;s Ã¼ber-fertility. Two years ago, when April Hill, an associate professor of biology at the University of Richmond, had her third child at age 38, one administrator remarked, &#8220;Aren&rsquo;t you a bit old for that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elisabeth R. Gruner, an associate professor of English at Richmond who contributed an essay to Mama Ph.D., says: &#8220;There is a distaste that you&rsquo;d want to spend a lot of time with little kids  &mdash;  an idea that you may not be very smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saranna R. Thornton, who heads the economics department at Hampden-Sydney College, was at a picnic with faculty and staff members nine years ago when she shared the good news that she was expecting her fourth child. A senior administrator looked at her and asked, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t you know what causes that?&#8221; Ms. Thornton even got quizzical looks from close friends and colleagues, who asked her why she was having another child. (The short answer, for Ms. Thornton and several other women who spoke to The Chronicle: They simply really enjoy children, sometimes much to their own surprise.)</p>
<p>Georgia Frank, an associate professor of religion at Colgate University, says she senses an attitude from some in academe that anyone who has more than two children has surpassed an invisible quota. &#8220;There is something greedy about going for just one more,&#8221; says Ms. Frank, whose own children are 15, 12, and 7.</p>

		<p>Lol, and how exactly is this relevant to the issue of white survival? </p>
<p>Who cares if women in academia have fewer children? From my experience, academics are not any &#8216;more intelligent&rsquo; than successful people in other areas; the difference isn&rsquo;t one of &#8216;IQ&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s a matter of temperament. In order to succeed in contemporary academia, a certain level of docility is required, first and foremost. How else could one be expected to survive the exceedingly &#8216;sensitive atmosphere&rsquo; in academia today? A lot of truly brilliant people are alienated from it because they feel suffocated. The ones that are left are not &#8216;especially bright&rsquo;, just more behaviorally suited to working in that environment.</p>
<p>Plus, I would be willing to guarantee that all of these &#8216;bright women&rsquo; are anti-racist, feminist types who would be horrified to think that their child-bearing behavior is an any way against the dominant paradigms of our time. If anything, this article is trying to claim that academia is &#8216;too masculine&rsquo; due to the emphasis on mind rather than body, and that things should be transformed in order to accomodate the female nature.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m curious, how does this have anything to do with white survival or interests?</p>

		<p>There are so many things that could be said, among them that societal systems that limit a females eduational opportunities may have arrived at that conclusion as ancient cultures due to a huge drop in fertility when the women left the home for those pursuits.  </p>
<p>What some might call equality could be viewed historically as mass self-extinction.  The world laughs at the American White male because he lost control of his female children.  So now they are running things with the result that Western civilizaiton fails and the barbarians will take over.  </p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s remember that they know how to get along and will - without the pesky White man to help.</p>
<p>Our revenge is their certain and miserable failure.</p>

		<p>We murder our best young men in wars that we have no business being in.  We intimidate our best women to NOT have children lest they face academic discrimination.  But we pay millions in welfare (TANF, Food Stamps, Medicaid) to reproduce future thugs and wh**es.  Makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>If a liberal boss or colleague asked me that question, I would report him for being sexist, hateful towards pregnant women, or whatever &#8220;hate thought&#8221; I could get him charged with. Mostly because I think it&rsquo;s hilarious when liberals get burnt by the idiotic policies they force on everyone else.</p>

		<p>My maternal aunt had six children with her Puerto Rican husband.  Can&rsquo;t really tell they&rsquo;re Hispanic because they&rsquo;re blue-eyed blonds.</p>
<p>My mother was from a family of eight children, a great-grandfather was the youngest of thirteen.  Looking at my family tree file, as recently as a couple of generations ago people in my family had lots of children.</p>
<p>Due to financial reasons my husband and I have one child.  But believe me, if we could afford it, we&rsquo;d have more.  I see nothing wrong with big families.  It&rsquo;s pretty bad that large families are looked down upon, especially if they&rsquo;re not doing it on the taxpayers&rsquo; dime (welfare).</p>

		<p>HH - I&rsquo;m white, I have four children, now adults. My son is 28 years old and has three children (one set of twins). When our group of friends were having children: my closest friend also had four children, another had three, regardless of &#8216;feminist&rsquo; propaganda of the time, we all had more than the standard two. I guess we assumed that the overpopulation nonsense referred to those having millions of children they couldn&rsquo;t feed or educate - Indians, Chinese etc..</p>
<p>I have three daughters yet to have children, but they all want more than two. Australia needs more white kids, we aim to please!</p>

		<p>As a young WN woman who has been a student at a liberal college for the last few years, I think it&rsquo;s absolutely wonderful that there are other people who are also irritated with the statistic that intelligent, hard working White women are having fewer children, while paying through the nose for welfare babies that are born at a phenomenal (and horrifying) rate.  There are too many women (some being professors, at that!) at my college who actually brag about having abortions, but will gladly have two or more children with their black or puerto rican husbands.  THIS is supposed to be the message sent by a women&rsquo;s studies program?  Replicating the White race is bad, but supporting the current leftist system that has done nothing for White women in academia is perfectly fine, because White people apparently owe minorities something?!  It almost makes me embarrassed to be a student there.  Leftist agendas preach nothing but pride, when in reality it&rsquo;s just a thin screen for ignorance and cowardice.  I can be proud to be everything except White at my school; I find this to be just plain sad.  It seems that the feminist theory taught at my college is merely anti-White theory.</p>
<p>What can I do about it?  My education teaches me to protest, go against the mainstream, and voice my opinion.  It seems that my education has misled me, and it&rsquo;s rather upsetting.</p>

<p>    Unfortunately, many academic women have become the shock troops of the new anti-white male &#8220;gender&#8221; feminists. I&rsquo;m really not surprised that they&rsquo;re not having children. This has been my experience in academia. These women have rejected the traditional role of mother and nurturer.  Some pay for it later in life becoming embittered, lonely, and totally disenchanted with petty academic office politics. Others seem to enjoy their ultimately empty and insignificant lives. </p>

<p>Mark Steyn has written about the European demographic deficit; in some places - such as rural Italy and rural Bulgaria - you can actually see it right in front of you. In Bulgaria, the only part of the town or the village where you&rsquo;ll see groups of little kids is the gypsy [&#8216;Roma&rsquo;] *mahala*</p>

		<p>I disagree with this totally. Plenty of &#8220;smart&#8221; women want to have children and intend on doing so. Actually, more men than women don&rsquo;t want to settle down and have a family, hence the refrain from females that men &#8220;don&rsquo;t want to commit&#8221;. However, as far as having 3 kids, many whites today simply can&rsquo;t afford to have more than 2 and this will be even more true with &#8220;Obama economics&#8221;!</p>

<p>One wonders, if the dehydrated near-geriatric gorgons who give the younger generation of academics a hard time about having larger families, are not simply bitter because they never had any at all?  As the old saying goes: misery loves company; the 70s or 60s hippie types who are now in their 60s or 70s and currently running academic departments, made their mistakes and would probably like to see others suffer the scourge of self-selected infertility too. </p>
<p>Ãber-childlessness is just dandy while the option of not remaining so indefinitely is still on the table, but once biology takes that card from the deck, reality sinks in and the long acidic brooding commences. </p>

		<p>Alexandra #12: It is outrageous that White families, with good homes, and a safe environment to raise them, are denied the opportunity to have more children, simply due to the cost of living. </p>
<p>Well, I will suggest here, what I personally do for other White families, and that is to make a donation of some type of goods, to assist the families, when their children arrive, and as they grow. </p>
<p>We have given away Play Pens, and Cribs, as well as Strollers, to parents of Newborns, that needed these items, and found it difficult to purchase them.</p>
<p>Along with durable items, we also gave away Baby Clothes, too. </p>
<p>I still get all sorts of coupons in the mail. Sometimes I get coupons for Infamil, or other baby formulas, as well as numerous other products. These, too, are given away to families I know that could use them. </p>
<p>There was a White Couple, today, wheeling their Twin boys around in a cart while they were shopping at Sam&rsquo;s Club. I gave them an extra coupon that we had for $3.00 off of a package of 20 kitchen paper towels. </p>
<p>My point here is, every little bit helps, and we should all pitch in to help those White families that are having several children, with some of their purchases of necessities, such as Kitchen paper towels. With two year old Twin boys, they will need the paper towels in the house.</p>
<p>How about a WN Baby Clothes Drive? This could be expanded to diapers, bottles, formula, cribs, car seats, and play pens. </p>
<p>We could also collect and distribute any coupons that we can not use, or know no one who could benefit from them, because there are other White families that could use them. </p>
<p>All White families, especially with young children, should visit the web sites for Natural News.com, as well as Brasscheck TV.com and watch the videos that are available about the series of Vaccinations that the Pharmaceutical Companies are pushing on infants, through their Doctors&rsquo; Offices.</p>
