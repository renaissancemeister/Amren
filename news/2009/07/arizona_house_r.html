<h1>Arizona House Rejects Immigration Enforcement Bill</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jacques Billeaud, AP, July 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Arizona House has defeated a bill that would have made it the only state in the nation to criminalize the presence of illegal immigrants by expanding its trespassing law.</p>
<p>The House voted 26-15 for the bill to expand Arizona&rsquo;s trespassing law Wednesday morning, but that was five votes short of the 31 needed for passage. The Senate approved the bill 16-11 earlier Wednesday.</p>
<p>Supporters say an expanded trespassing law would provide a second layer of enforcement to help local police catch immigrants who slip past federal agents.</p>
<p>Opponents predicted it would lead to racial profiling for thousands of Latinos who are U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants account for an estimated 500,000 people in Arizona&rsquo;s 6.5 million population.<br/>

		<p>Did anyone during the so-called Red Scare era ever say that McCarthyism would lead to profiling of Russian or other Slavic/eastern European immigrants? No, because people back in the 1940s and 1950s were more prudent and not engrossed in a perverted liberal ideology and mindset. People back in those times would have seen such a ridiculous claim as absurd, which is precisely what the twisted reasoning of the opponents of the said bill is: absurd.</p>
<p>Common sense seems to be a rare feature among our current political elites, even in some Republicans like John McCain, who wanted to grant amnesty to 20,000,000 illegal aliens who were wrongfully residing in our country.</p>

		<p>  Clearly the fact that someone, somewhere might be discriminated means we should forget about any kind of border enforcement!  It is simply unbelievable what liberalism has done to this country.  When will Americans turn aside from their basketball games and reality tv shows long enough to bring this nonsense to a halt?</p>

		<p>Opposing the bill by saying that it would lead to the racial profiling of Mestizos is an unambiguous admission that most illegals are Mestizos.  What&rsquo;s more, saying that laws should not be made or enforced because most of the people in violation of such laws belong to a particular race, is indeed blatantly racist.  Brown people should not be granted immunity from immigration laws.</p>

		<p>500K out of 6.5MM. That&rsquo;s 1 in 13! If you&rsquo;re in Arizona you pass dozens of illegal mestizos every day. Profiling? I think there are more pressing concerns. Arizona better wake up or the California mess is certainly on the way. California could be avoiding their problem with just such a law that would expel the main reason for the problems the state is facing. Maybe you Arizonans need to replace about 6 of those &#8220;representatives&#8221; before more of your money goes to illegal Mexicans and less to Arizonans. Or maybe the citizens of the southwest should just give the area back to La Raza. Seems like they&rsquo;re taking it anyway. With the help of Arizonans themselves.</p>

		<p>We better just become a land of no laws because we might discriminate somebody.</p>
<p>The sad thing is under this token of discrimination were are becoming the land of Uberlaws thus freedom will eventually be strangled into nonexistence.</p>

<p>So, they should eliminate enforcement targeting:</p>
<p>- illegal drugs, particularly smuggling (virtually all done by &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;)</p>
<p>- DUI (that &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; gained notoriety for)</p>
<p>- identity theft (&#8220;Hispanic&#8221; illegals need to steal identity in order to get a job and public assistance)</p>
<p>- tax evasion (&#8220;Hispanic&#8221; illegals must often be paid &#8220;under the table&#8221; so that they cannot pay income tax)</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t it appear in these morons&rsquo; bird&rsquo;s brains that, using their idiot&rsquo;s logic, all it takes for &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; to derail enforcement against their lawbreaking activities is to make sure that the majority of lawbreakers are &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;?<br/>
