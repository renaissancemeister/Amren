			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like, July 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black people don&rsquo;t like to be told what to do. This is a fact and an irrefutable one. They were told to sit in the back of the bus, and refused. They were told to not eat at the same restaurants as others, and they refused.</p>
<p>They were told not violate the anti-miscegenation laws of states and they refused. They have been told not to violate the laws of the United States of America, and yet, they refuse steadfastly.</p>
<p>More so, Black people have been told to cooperate with the police, the only protection that law abiding citizens have from the miscreants of society, and yet Black people retain that stubborn streak and refuse to comply with police demands.</p>
<p>Rodney King, the man who started one of the biggest riots in the past thirty years, could have avoided his fate  &mdash;  and absolved Los Angeles from over $1 billion worth of damage  &mdash;  but he failed to cooperate with police:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Had Rodney King just acknowledged the police officers with a simple &#8216;yes sir&rsquo;, instead of being obstinate, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been beaten, sent to jail and then directly caused a massive riot that left many devoid of their lives.</p>
<p>Another recent example of a Black person failing to cooperate with the police is Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, a Black man who is perpetually incapable of dealing with any situation without finding the acrid scent of racism attached to it. He is a vital part of the Black community in America and respected for his strong stances in defense of his people, and yet, in a recent incident with police, he showed himself to be yet another SBPDL example of not cooperating with police.</p>
<p>Gates was trying to enter his home, and to his neighbors it appeared a Black person was breaking into his home. They called the police. What follows is a great example of why you should cooperate with the police and also why you should not berate them, regardless of your skin color or your stance in the professional race racketeering industry:<blockquote>As soon as Officer Crowley arrived and got to the front door, he encountered, standing inside the door, none other than Gates, who instantly began yelling at him in an extremely loud voice that he was a &#8220;racist police officer.&#8221; Instead of defusing the situation by cooperating with the officer, who was, after all, only doing his job, instead of simply explaining politely that he lived in the house and that his house had not been broken into (though it&rsquo;s still not clear who the two young men were), Gates continued his &#8220;tumultuous,&#8221; threatening (&#8220;you don&rsquo;t know who I am, you&rsquo;ll be sorry for messing with me&#8221;), and extremely insulting behavior for a long time, first inside the house, where his voice was so loud that the officer could not conduct a conversation over his police radio, then outside the house, alarming passersby, until, after warning Gates twice that he was behaving disorderly, Crowley arrested him. And during the whole time Gates kept bellowing that Crowley was a &#8220;racist police officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, from early on in the incident, Officer Crowley repeatedly began to leave Gates&rsquo; house, but Gates stopped him, insisting that Crowley first tell him his name. But each time Crowley gave his name, Gates kept shouting so loudly that he couldn&rsquo;t hear the officer&rsquo;s answer. And when Crowley would again start to leave the house, Gates would again demand his name.<br>
</blockquote>Gates was of course arrested, sparking national coverage of the victim hood of Mr. Gates at the hands of the racist police. In a world run by evil white supremacists  &mdash;  as so many Black people believe America is run by  &mdash;  Mr. Gates would have had a black bag put over head and shot for his insolence. Instead, the truth of Gates&rsquo; uncooperative attitude with the police has been silenced and the supposed racial angle of the profiling of a Black man  &mdash;  even more so one who is a &#8216;respected&rsquo; Black scholar  &mdash;  has been the focal point of the story.</p>
<p>Black people do not yet understand that in Post-Obama America, they run the show and call the shots and have a complicit media prepared to cover up any negative portrayal of Black people. The media will showcase only positive images of Black people, even when a prominent Black person does not cooperate with the police. White racism will always be the culcript, not a Black person failing to cooperate with the police and yelling at him and calling him a racist for daring to arrest a great Black scholar.</p>
<p>They can in turn make the story one of racial profiling, instead of yet another example of Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like; cooperating with the police. Even in Pre-Obama America, as evidenced by the Rodney King affair, the truth of any crime and not cooperating with the police was made to look like another example of white racism, not Black people failing to cooperate with the police.<br>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the key sentence in the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Had Rodney King just acknowledged the police officers with a simple &lsquo;yes sir&rsquo;, instead of being obstinate, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been beaten, sent to jail and then directly caused a massive riot that left many devoid of their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is where the poignancy lies.  That riot hurt mostly White people like Reginald Denny.  That riot only gave more power to Blacks and showed Whites that Blacks can do what they want.  The police basically stood down.  They did nothing to stop anyone.  The police just let the riots wind down of themselves.  The police were afraid of being called &#8220;racists&#8221; and the possibility of losing their jobs was too much for them.  Rodney King who was a criminal element anyway, also won money in a civil lawsuit.  So really folks anytime Blacks are appropriately treated it is US, WE   &mdash;  - WHITE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER   &mdash;  - NOT BLACKS.  Thirty-seven thousand four hundred and sixty rapes on White women in 2005.  Less than 10 rapes of Black women by White men in the same year.  And every years&rsquo; statistics are about the same.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s wake up before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

		<p>I had a feeling it had something to do with not cooporating.  I work with a large number of black people and all they have been arguing about is that this is an event fueled entirely by racism.  I informed them that I have been arrested breaking into my own home once by an officer and I cooporated fully, kept my mouth shut, and called my lawyer when I got to the police station, only to be let go a few hours later.  I did not sue the police and claim racism because I know the police were just doing their job and if it wasn&rsquo;t me breaking into my own house, I&rsquo;d sure as hell want the police there to handle the situation exactly as they did with me.</p>

<p>Too true. If Mr. King had followed the instructions to &#8216;get down&rsquo; and &#8216;stay down&rsquo;, there would have been no need for a defensive strike by the police. That Mr. King kept getting up made him a threat to the officers.</p>
<p>What more of Mr. Gates can be said that hasn&rsquo;t been said. While the average, intelligent white man would try to be as cooperative and non-threatening when the police arrived, Mr. Gates reveals his true persona; &#8216;I am a black man of privilege. How DARE you not know who I am&rsquo;.</p>
<p>While I know some people have a healthy distrust for the police, whenever I&rsquo;m around police, I always keep in mind that these guys have to deal with the lowest of the low, the worst of the worst and they&rsquo;re expected to be respectful. I try to cut these guys some slack and not make their job difficult and my actions threatening.<br>

		<p>He&rsquo;s solely at Harvard as an affirmative action quota.  If he truly was the great scholar he - and many pathetic whites - claim, he would have understood the situation, cooperated, and behaved like a highly-educated and dignified gentleman.  It is this type of behavior that will evenutally be their undoing as a race.  No matter how much you educate them, no matter how much you provide, no matter how much you praise them, no matter how often you turn your cheek, in the end they&rsquo;re all thugs looking for noriety and reparations.</p>
<p>When the Hispanics take over, or the Chinese, this nonsense is going to stop cold.  The Hispanics will fight them and the Chinese will just shoot them.  If the Muslims take over, we all know they like slavery - a lot!!!  The future might look bright after all.</p>

		<p>well this is so typical.  here in atlanta, i was house-sitting for a friend intown and had to call the police because someone&rsquo;s parked car was blocking the entrance to her place, so i called the police.  </p>
<p>sure enough, the drunken african-american male stumbled up to the police officer, who asked him if it was his car.  oh no, the man lied to the officer.  then he admitted it was he who parked the car, but it was his girlfriend&rsquo;s.  of course the car had no insurance, so it would be towed anyway.  </p>
<p>the officer said everything was OK but he would have to make arrangements to pick up the car from the impound lot.  well of course instead of moving along, he had to angrily confront the officer, verbally assaulting and berating him for picking on a &#8216;poor black man&rsquo;.  the officer gave him at least three chances to move on, but no - the black guy could not leave well-enough alone until one of his homey friends came along and dragged him off.  </p>
<p>soo typical.  i have a new respect for police officers after having to put up with that.  </p>

		<p>Three cheers for Offficer Crowley and the neighbor who phoned in the report that he answered.</p>
<p>The crime rate in Cambridge is quite high.  In fact, the burglary rate of 654 per 100,000 population is over 5 times as high as it is my average Chicago suburb.</p>
<p>We have our share of small crime but a five-fold increase over what we have in ANYTHING would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, the next time Mr. Crowley is called to the scene of a home&rsquo;s door being broken in by a male black, will he:</p>
<p>a) Arrive with guns drawn<br>
b) Approach stealthfully<br>
c) Act aggressively<br>
d) None of the above</p>
<p>They wonder why cops and citizens hesitate to act.  And on his press conference Obama said that this cop acted &#8220;Stupidly&#8221;.</p>
<p>How would you react if this whole scenario unfolded in your backyard?</p>

		<p> The Mulatto Messiah, at his news conference this evening, gave the official left-wing black spin to this story, saying Gates was arrested supposedly for &#8220;showing his ID card to prove he owned the house.&#8221; Nothing about Gates&rsquo; hysterical yelling, refusal to cooperate with the police, etc., etc.</p>
<p> The way many blacks like Gates act toward police is called &#8220;obstreperous;&#8221; that is, refusal to obey authority. I&rsquo;d tell you what slaves used to call one of their number who acted that way toward &#8220;de man&#8221; in plantation days, but my post would be deleted if I used the entire phrase. </p>

		<p>One thing I find amazing about this story is Gates&rsquo; utter lack of self-reflection. He doesn&rsquo;t appear to question his role in the affair at all, as if it is presumed from the start that he could do no wrong and that the fault must all be due to the white &#8220;racist&#8221; cop.</p>
<p>To me this raises the question whether enough black leaders like Gates &#8220;get it&#8221; regarding one of the fundamental tenets of Western civilization and universal morality. I was brought up to believe that one must question one&rsquo;s own role when wrong is done. Obviously even white people will get enraged in certain situations, but one of the main issues is what we do after that: Do we see what really happened and did we do anything to cause it? </p>
<p>If my understanding is right, it sounds like Gates has no regard whatsoever about this civilizational and moral principle. Rather, he feels quite at home blaming whitey, or the &#8220;Other,&#8221; as it were, without regard to the full facts of the matter. He only sees the point of view of himself and his racial group. In other words, he follows the principle of individual and group ego and agendas, not right and wrong.</p>
<p>To the extent the media and others support him, it is only just one more indication of the steady descent of the West into a more sub-moral, Darwinian existence, driven in part, I believe, by groups antagonistic to Westerners, both ethnoracial and political (leftist). I have never read Gates (may someday), but he has lost a lot of credibility with me on this one. His performance during the incident was out of bounds, and by continuing to push the issue afterwards he is showing himself to be a vain, bigoted man. At the same time, we get to see more of his true colors and the colors of his supporters, and the polarization of society along ultimately beneficial lines will continue.</p>

		<p>This is one of those stories that just gets more infuriating the more one thinks about it. I hope the university charges the so-called professor for any damage done to the door. All he had to do was identify himself and explain to the officer that things weren&rsquo;t as they seemed.</p>
<p>What was he doing trying to break into the place anyway? If it&rsquo;s university housing, couldn&rsquo;t he have called campus security for help getting in?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m white, and have had to explain such things to cops before. Most of them aren&rsquo;t out to hassle innocent people, but they ARE trained to follow up on suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>This buffoon has succeeded in removing any lingering respect I might have had for &#8220;black studies.&#8221; He doesn&rsquo;t seem any smarter than the average ghetto-dwelling riff-raff. I hope this story gets wide coverage, and that this fool ends up being the one who apologizes!</p>

		<p>Lord, I remember the Rodney King riots.  Actually, I think that was my turning point.  It&rsquo;s been awhile now, but I remember a truck driver being dragged out of the truck and beaten badly by of mob of Blacks.  The press never really mentioned the Black on White event but for me, it struck home.  That could be any White in the US that was unfortunate enough to being around a bunch of Blacks that felt &#8216;enraged&rsquo;.  The event will continue to repeat itself in one way or another and there will always be an attempt at some sort of justification or downplay.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire but you&rsquo;ll never see the true cause in the MSM.</p>

		<p>I was questioned by the police one night in my driveway. I had been working out of town for several months,and had gotten back home about 1:30 AM on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>An officer drove by a few minutes after I&rsquo;d opened the house back up,and seeing activity where there had been none for a couple of months stopped to see just what was going on. Part of the activity the officer observed was a rather scroungy looking white male rummaging in the bed of a pickup,and there was a door open where previously everything had been locked up.</p>
<p>The scroungy looking white guy was me-I&rsquo;d been driving for something like 26 hours,and I was rooting around in my luggage trying to figure out what bag contained my razor,my toothbrush,and a change of clothes.</p>
<p>When he asked me what was going on,I did NOT freak out and start making wild accusations about his motives. I simply explained that I owned the place,I had been working out of town for the past few months,and that I&rsquo;d just gotten back and was sure glad to be here.</p>
<p>He never even asked me for any ID! He called in my license plate,and when it came back and the address matched,he politely welcomed me home,wished me a good evening and drove off to continue his shift.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t annoyed by the cop,who was doing what I help pay him to do.</p>
<p>Why in the heck Gates had to make a monstrous issue over something as simple as verifying that,&#8221;Yup,I live here-had trouble getting inside just now.&#8221;,is beyond me.</p>

		<p>Linking from a VDARE blog article I just read that Obama said the Police acted &#8220;stupidly&#8221;.  <br>
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS AND EVERY SINGLE WHITE PERSON IN AMERICA OUGHT TO BE VERY, VERY CONCERNED!<br>
He then admits he doesn&rsquo;t know specifics so can&rsquo;t say to what extent Race played a role. <br>
&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts (Dedalus: Yo, Obama! You don&rsquo;t &#8220;see&#8221; facts, you &#8220;know&#8221; them. You pretentious semi-literate)what role race played in that [Gates case].&#8221;  </p>
<p>Race?</p>
<p>NEWS FLASH!</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the specifics how do you know for sure if, in FACT, it was the POLICE who acted &#8220;stupidly&#8221; (Pretentious Adverb - NERD ALERT) and not Gates?</p>
<p>Well, he doesn&rsquo;t know.  This case is loaded with bad judgement from two Black men who do NOT, in any way, shape, or form, deserve to be where they are. They are two amoral, Affirmative Action, Psuedo-Intellectuals, AT BEST! <br>
Anyone familiar with that t-shirt that reads &#8220;DANGER: An Educated Black Man&#8221;?<br>
It should read &#8220;DANGER: An &#8220;Educated&#8221; Black Man.  It wouldn&rsquo;t be closer to the truth. It WOULD be the truth.  Obviously!</p>
<p>But, there is a good side to this disgraceful episode. By all accounts, indluding even the MSM, the Police throughout Boston (and not just Boston) are FURIOUS at Obama.<br>
THIS IS GOOD!<br>
After this incident Policemen throughout all of the United States of America now know that they do not have the Presidents support. This will do wonders for Race relations, to say nothing of how it will effect the performance of Policemen on the job.  If I was a Black Thug and I heard Obama say that, I would think that he just gave me the green light to do whatever I wanted to whoever I wanted.<br>
WHAT A SHOCKINGLY IRRESPONSIBLE THING FOR OBAMA TO SAY!<br>
This is a man who then said,<br>
&#8220;&hellip;what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there&rsquo;s a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That&rsquo;s just a fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>NOTHING ABOUT THEIR GUILT!  NOTHING!</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Obama, the (God Save the Mark) President of the United States, could not make it any clearer where he will stand in a Race War.<br>
This&hellip;.well, &#8220;man&#8221;, is Commander and Chief of the worlds largest military!<br>
So, I say to you all, under no uncertain terms, these three words, </p>
<p>LOCK AND LOAD!<br>

		<p>Obama was just on TV and a &#8220;reporter&#8221; asked him about this. He said Gates is a personal friend of his, and refered to the Cambridge police as &#8220;stupid&#8221; for arresting Gates. <br>
Of course, he said he didn&rsquo;t know all the facts in the case, but was awfull quick to judge the white cops, wasn&rsquo;t he? 3 1/2 more yrs. of this rascist to go.</p>

		<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t have dropped the charges, it is hard to imagine a more clear cut case for disorderly conduct and they had plenty of willing witnesses. Why even have laws against crime at all if the DA just drops the charges whenever the criminal is just too upset and throws a tantrum like a little child for being &#8220;dissed&#8221; by being prosecuted? </p>
<p>The big plus of conviction too of course that it would preclude any possibility of a massive expensive &#8220;False arrest&#8221; lawsuit, which will be forthcoming just as sure as the sun rises in the East with all the media circus and turmoil that is sure to follow. You can only sue if you get off the hook  &mdash;  a conviction would stifle that particular horror.</p>
<p>If only the DA had the conviction of Officer Crowley and simply said &#8220;it is an open and shut case we aren&rsquo;t dropping the charges&#8221; it might of instilled a smidgeon of humility in this pompous windbag (well unlikely but maybe), however the DA foolishly took the easy road which only further support  this loudmouth&rsquo;s sense of moral superiority and anti white/ anti cop delusions  prolonging the misery and embarrassment for all involved.<br>

		<p><i>Had Rodney King just acknowledged the police officers with a simple &lsquo;yes sir&rsquo;, instead of being obstinate, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been beaten, sent to jail and then directly caused a massive riot that left many devoid of their lives.</i></p>
<p>Well, not directly. The MSM, with its endless replaying of a short snippet of the beating video, had a big hand in sparking the riots. In fact, in a fair world, the cost of rebuilding would have come directly out of the MSM&rsquo;s profits. If it hastened their impending bankruptcy, too bad.</p>
<p>An even better quote from Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like comes from #53. Space Exploration:</p>
<p><i>Black people look at the accomplishment of Pre-Obama America with scorn; landing on the moon pales in comparison to the greatest achievement in mankind&rsquo;s history - the election of a Black person, Barack Obama, as president - and all white achievements prior to this event aren&rsquo;t worthy of study.</i></p>
<p>Too true. Most blacks have a very narrow range of interests, and if an achievement is not seen as directly benefiting them in some way, especially if it is an achievement of whites, it holds little interest for them.</p>

		<p>  The officer was responding to a complaint from the neighbors. He had to check it out. Cambridge Massachusetts is an ultra-liberal college town, so I&rsquo;m sure the police are walking on egg shells most of the time. I think that Dr. Henry Gates over-reacted and could have avoided the arrest by acting calmly and cooperatively. However, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, Dr. Gates has an enormous ego, and an inflated sense of self importance.  Mr. Gates should have asked to call his lawyer, and gone quietly with the police. This is the best and most rational policy.  Now I suppose we will have a PBS documentary on police harassment of minorities written by Dr. Henry Louis Gates. </p>

		<p>I believe if I was seen attempting to break into my own house, I would understand that such a thing probably looked questionable, and might invite investigating. I would understand when the <br>
police showed up that it would look questionable to them, as well. So I would calmly and rationally explain what happened, and would not issue a parting shot, &#8220;I guess this is because I&rsquo;m a white female in America!!&#8221; I would be grateful someone in the neighborhood was doing something pro-active about protecting my home and phoned the police. I would find out through the police dept. who had phoned, and I would go visit them and thank them for their actions.</p>
<p>But then, I&rsquo;m not an angry black man (particularly a wealthy black man in a prestigious position, much more well off than many and with absolutely no reason to be angry since my position was proof positive that blacks can and have risen above their 1960&rsquo;s excuses of non equal rights).  </p>
<p>Race relations will NEVER be improved. Ever. They will continue to go in the opposite direction as white apologies and subservience is continued to be crammed down our throats.</p>

		<p>One time my husband and I were driving to Wisconsin Dells.  We had just crossed the state line into Wisconsin and I decided to park at a gas station to rest for a bit, as we were both tired from driving.</p>
<p>I guess a cop thought we looked suspicious, especially with an Ohio license plate on the car and he asked to see our driver&rsquo;s licenses.  So we handed them over, he scanned them (there&rsquo;s that magnetic strip on the back), and there was no problem.  We didn&rsquo;t go off on him.  To this day I don&rsquo;t know what he thought we might be doing, maybe he suspected drugs, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;we just said that we were tired and needed to sit for a bit.</p>
<p>We have had to &#8220;break&#8221; into our own house once when we locked the keys in it.  I guess no one called the cops because the neighbors would have recognized us.  And this was during the day.</p>
<p>Plus, I have seen footage on World&rsquo;s Wildest Police Videos where someone refuses to stop, like for a brake light that&rsquo;s out, and the police have to go on a merry chase, come to find out the suspect is involved in illegal activity, that&rsquo;s why they refused to stop even though the cop probably would have just told them to fix the light, then be on his way.  So if a cop asks someone for ID to make sure they&rsquo;re actually the home&rsquo;s occupant and they go ballistic, what do you think the cop is thinking&hellip;?</p>

		<p>This is so bizarre than one can only conclude that the ridiculous &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Gates was clearly intent on creating an incident.</p>
<p>I had a similar thing happen to me a few months back, when our silent burglar alarm went off (apparently due to a momentary power failure) and summonded the local police.  I was sitting out on our back patio reading the paper when I saw one of our local cops come around the corner of the house with his hand on his pistol. He approached and asked, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I replied, &#8220;I live here.  Why are you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>He replied that the alarm had gone off and asked to see some ID, which I furnished, apologizing for the false alarm but thanking him for his prompt response.  Both of us were polite and civil.</p>
<p>I simply can&rsquo;t imagine anybody behaving as this character Gates did when the cop showed up.  He was clearly and maliciously trying to create an incident, and it&rsquo;s very much to the discredit of Obama (who already has more than enough discredit) that he automatically sided with Gates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to cost him politically.</p>

		<p>It seems that BHO slipped his leash and was out running his mouth without a teleprompter.  He is apparently so divorced from healthy reality that he sees this as a case of &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; and police stupidity, instead of a normal incident that got out of hand because an arrogant celebrity professor acted like a juvenile.  Tens of millions of law-abiding Whites have had similar encounters with police that ended amicably because we had the sense to see how things looked to the cop and simply explained ourselves.  I would not doubt that back in Chicago, Obama pulled that &#8220;Do you know who I am?&#8221; routine more than once.  </p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m going to poke my head out of my cave to comment on this one. I&rsquo;m 90% in agreement with the posts here. If the police reports are accurate, the officers were doing their jobs, and the Harvard racist prof was being a total jerk. My problem is with the idea of being arrested for &#8216;disorderly conduct&#8221; which can be a very subjective charge indeed. My feelings are that unless an officer is being assaulted-not battered-or there are other circumstances that genuinely justify an arrest-no arrest should be made. Too many police officers make arrests for disorderly when a citizen is justifiably irate . I&rsquo;m not sure if that happened in this case or not-probably not. But I do know that a lot of people, white as well as black, get arrested on flimsy pretense, just to get them into the system and generate revenue. That&rsquo;s the problem I have with contemporary law enforcement-it&rsquo;s becoming more about revenue and less about justice.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Professor&#8221; Gates is typical of race hucksters.  He parlayed what was a misunderstanding into an incident to promote his agenda. He saw an opportunity and seized it just like any other of his like minded race baiters would have done except that this fell right into his lap.  He didn&rsquo;t have to go searching for it. This incident will ensure his permanent tenure at Harvard where he can continue indoctinating Blacks and self- hating Whites about the evil of Caucasians.</p>
<p>President Obama showed his true mind state when he made his &#8220;stupidly&#8221; comment followed by the obligatory racial profiling comment as if he weren&rsquo;t aware of the fact that Blacks and Hispanics commit a disproportionate amount of crime. Hey, no harm in pandering to the Hispanic vote prior to the off year elections! Let&rsquo;s not forget that this is the same man who referred to the grandmother who raised him, following his abandonment by his Black father and the later death of his mother, as &#8220;a typical White woman&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Get a copy of &#8216;Farewell Espana&rsquo; (Howard M. Sachar), a history of the Sephardic Diaspora.  Go to the chapters on the treatment of Jews in Northern Africa.  The treatment of all whites in America, in a couple of years, will be very much like the fate of that small group of whites(Jews)who had fled the Inquisition for the relative safety Northern Africa.  The coming oppression of whites will be horrible, and it will not benefit anyone&hellip;not even our oppressors.</p>
<p>Our intelligence and industriousness will not help us any more than did the intelligence and industriousness of the Jews of Northern Africa.  Once non-whites have the upper hand, we won&rsquo;t stand a chance.  Appeals to reason will have no effect.

<p>Police union condemns Obama&rsquo;s comments  <br>
By Sam Youngman  <br>
Posted: 07/23/09 01:58 PM [ET]  <br>
President Obama&rsquo;s Wednesday night criticism of Cambridge, Mass., police has drawn a rebuke from the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP).</p>
<p>The criticism comes after Obama said Cambridge police officers acted &#8220;stupidly&#8221; when they arrested Henry Louis Gates, a friend of the president&rsquo;s, after he broke into his own home. Gates was arrested on disorderly conduct charges, which were then dropped. The president said it highlights ongoing problems with race relations in the U.S.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jim Pascoe, executive director of the FOP&rsquo;s legislative office, noted that before Obama made the remarks, the president acknowledged that he was only vaguely familiar with what happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;That being the case, it&rsquo;s unfortunate that he chose to say anything,&#8221; Pascoe said. &#8220;He wasn&rsquo;t there, and he doesn&rsquo;t know what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pascoe said it appears that Gates was the &#8220;provocateur&#8221; because he called Officer James Crowley a racist instead of producing identification as requested.</p>
<p>On Thursday, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs sought to walk back the president&rsquo;s comments. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Let me be clear. He was not calling the officer stupid, OK?&#8221; Gibbs told reporters on Air Force One. &#8220;He was denoting that &hellip; at a certain point the situation got far out of hand, and I think all sides understand that.&#8221;  <br>

		<p>As a Police Officer I know enough that if I am stopped and questioned by an officer that I need to comply.  The first words out of my mouth are not that I&rsquo;m a cop, but instead I would quietly listen to what the officer is asking.  I may resemble a person he/she is looking for and realize that they do not know who I am.  Too many blacks start to mouth off before they even know why they were stopped.  It&rsquo;s the typical &#8220;you stopped me because I&rsquo;m black&#8221; routine.  They need to lose the attitude and start listening.  That goes for anyone stopped by the police.     </p>

		<p>I see in the latest headlines that Officer Crowley is an expert in &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;, and teaches other cops how to avoid such nefarious behavior.  He was specially chosen for the job by a Black superior, and he supports BHO 110 percent.  Maybe we don&rsquo;t have a dog in this fight, and can all sit back and enjoy the spectacle of Gates, Obama, and Cambridge Massachusetts make fools of themselves.  </p>

		<p>I read all the details about the Gates incident at View from the Right.  When I saw Gates on t.v. at the gym, the subtitles said he was married to a white woman and his children were half white.  He seems, like most blacks, to be motivated almost entirely by racial animus - rather than &#8220;black and proud,&#8221; as some claim, he is just seething that he can&rsquo;t be white, too.</p>

		<p>&#8220;That riot hurt mostly White people like Reginald Denny. That riot only gave more power to Blacks and showed Whites that Blacks can do what they want. The police basically stood down. They did nothing to stop anyone. The police just let the riots wind down of themselves. The police were afraid of being called &ldquo;racists&rdquo; and the possibility of losing their jobs was too much for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rodney King riot led directly to the OJ Simpson verdict.  As soon as Simpson was arrested and charged the black leadership went directly to the Mayor, District Attorney, Police Chief, movers and shakers like Eli Broad and others and told them that if Simpson were not found innocent another riot would ensue.  Remember, the Brown/Goldman murder was just 2 years after the King riots, the city had not yet recovered.</p>
<p>Under pressure from some of the wealthiest businessmen in the world, the Mayor, Judge and District Attorney complied.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the trial was held at the Downtown court house in a district that had the biggest percentage of blacks in the entire county.  It should have been held in the Santa Monica courthouse.  All other high profile murder trials have been held in the district in which they occurred. Christian Brando&rsquo;s in Santa Monica.  Robert Blake&rsquo;s in Van Nuys courthouse.  Phil Spector&rsquo;s in his district courthouse.</p>
<p>The Santa Monica courthouse is in a location much, much better for a media camp and a high profile trial.  The downtown courthouse has no plazas or empty space.  The building is right up on the sidewalk on all 4 sides.  There are no empty spaces within miles.</p>
<p>The Santa Monica courthouse is located in the middle of a spacious parking lot about 6 blocks long and 2 blocks wide.  The city of Santa Monica has an airport just a few miles away.  The airport is underdeveloped.  It has several miles of parking spaces.  The city college already uses the airport as a parking lot.  The airport is used for parking for many public events.  The city of Santa Monica has its own bus system that shuttles people back and forth from the airport parking all around the city.</p>
<p>It would have made sense to turn the huge courthouse parking lot into a media camp.  Employees and others using the courthouse could have used the airport parking lot and shuttle buses.  It would have taken more time to transact business, but the inconvenience would have been nothing to the traffic mess(and pedestrain mess) around the downtown courthouse caused by the Simpson trial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that the trial was held downtown to ensure an all black jury.  </p>
<p>Then jury selection.  </p>
<p>How is it possible that a county with only a 10 percent black population in the 1990 census managed to select a jury that ended up 10 out of 12 blacks?  Answer; it was designed to be that way from the beginning.  One hispanic woman was bounced off early in the trial because blacks who worked with her alleged she was a &#8220;racist.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s jury tampering folks.  It is obvious that the defense researched every non black juror and alternative and then contacted the hispanic women&rsquo;s black co- workers to make up false accusations of racism.  </p>
<p>A potential juror, a 5&rsquo;3 120 pd white woman in her 60&rsquo;s was accused of shoving and physically threatening black jurors and bounced off the panel.</p>
<p>Judge Ito lost control of the trial the first day and never regained it. He did that on purpose.</p>
<p> I knew as soon as I saw that the 2 district attorneys were affirmative action hires that Simpson would win.The district attorney&rsquo;s office had several highly skilled WHITE MALE MERIT SELECTED district attorney&rsquo;s who could have done a much better job.</p>
<p>Marcia Clark later defended herself for the fact that she selected a 10 out of 12 black, mostly black female jury by claiming that since black men are the most abusive of women black women being victims themselves would be sympathetic to Nicole.  </p>
<p>Marcia Clark worked in the district attorney&rsquo;s office all during the 1980&rsquo;s before affirmative action of hispanics really started.  Like all white women in government employ at the time, she was surrounded by vicious black women who hated her and all other white women.  A white women working with blacks is very aware of their hatred and viciousness.  Marcia Clark knew exactly what she was doing and what kind of jury she was getting.</p>
<p>Attorney&rsquo;s think that Marcia Clark&rsquo;s biggest mistake was to participate in the destruction of police detective Mark Fuhrman.  Instead of defending her witness she treated him worse that Bob Shapiro and Johnny Cochran did.  Chris Darden did nothing at all.  Judge Ito allowed the destruction of Mark Fuhrman and not so subtlely allowed the defense to control the trial.</p>
<p>That was not a trial, it was totally planned that way.  Judge Ito was not rewarded.  Marcia Clark and Chris Darden were.  Clark made 4 million on a book deal and retired to raise her children and enjoy life.  Chris had a ghost writer and &#8220;wrote&#8221; a few books.  He is presently &#8220;of counsel&#8221; to a couple law firms.  He doesn&rsquo;t have to do much work, just be a rainmaker who is supposed to attract wealthy clients and money making cases.  Chris is of course still hated by the black community but the book advances and his high salary make up for it.</p>
<p>For what it is worth, here is a bit of gossip picked up from a friend whose Father is an attorney who got it from a private investigator he works with who is a retired police officer:</p>
<p>The knife was found a few days later in some bushes near Simpson&rsquo;s house.  The knife is still in an evidence locker in a sealed envelope.  Maybe true, maybe not, who knows?</p>
<p>That is the power the blacks have gained with their riots, violence and being backed up by the liberals and communists since 1909.</p>

<p>Very true. Usually the law abiding stop.  All cops know that those who run off often have something to hide such as outstanding warrants.</p>
<p>Remember that incident in Oakland a few months ago?  </p>
<p>4 officers and 1 black suspect dead because the suspect ran when stopped for a traffic offense.  Turned out that the suspect had raped 2 women earlier that day and thought the police were stopping him because of the rapes rather than whatever traffic offense he committed. </p>
<p>Of course  a reasonable man would drive carefully after he committed 2 rapes to avoid coming to the attention of police, but this was a black felon.</p>

Enormous because fed an unending diet of narcissitic victimology. The man is a walking confirmation of the comical insight that in certain organizations people are promoted to the level of their incompetence. The guy is just out of his league altogether. </p>

<p>Cambridge police commissioner defends officer in Gates arrest</p>
<p>Boston Globe ^ | July 23, 2009 | By Martin Finucane<br>
The Cambridge police commissioner today defended the actions of the sergeant who arrested prominent black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. last week at his home, saying he believed the sergeant acted &#8220;consistent with his training&#8221; and without racial bias. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe that Sergeant [James M.] </p>
<p>Crowley acted with any racial motivation at all,&#8221; said Commissioner Robert Haas. Haas also revealed, in response to reporters&rsquo; questions at the news conference, that Gates&rsquo;s house had been broken into before the incident. He did not specify exactly when the break-in had taken place. Asked about Obama&rsquo;s comment, Cambridge police commissioner Robert&hellip; </p>

		<p>If I were a cop this is what I&rsquo;d say on national television:</p>
<p>&#8220;We profoundly regret responding to a call that reported a suspected burglary at  in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  We now realize that this is inappropriate to do when the homeowner is black.  Henceforth we will no longer respond to reports of burglary at, Cambridge Massachusetts.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I actually had this happen to me several weeks ago. Standard routine police work. Found the opened and empty wrapper of an audio player in my mailbox. Was left by someone that had shoplifted the item, so I surmised. Called the local cops and told them. They wanted to see and sent a cop over to pick the wrapper up. When the cop arrived I was standing in the open doorway of my garage. The cop took the wrapper and asked for my ID. Standard police work.</p>

		<p>David Horowitz made a great statement today while referring to Gates&rsquo;s remark to the policeman what happens to a Black man in America.<br>
He said &#8220;What happens to a Black man in America? You slit your wife&rsquo;s throat from ear to ear and you get aquitted.&#8221;</p>

Gates is a troublemaking buffoon and he&rsquo;s wildly overplaying the race card. And I&rsquo;m sure many many well-meaning white Obama voters recognize this. Whites who voted for Obama did so because of their (naive) belief that this sort of racial friction would soon be disappearing. That in Obama&rsquo;s New, Improved AmericaLand, the ethnic-grievance industry would start withering away of its own accord. That under the benevolent guidance of The One, race hustling and poverty pimping of the Sharpton/Jackson variety would inevitably go out of style and fade away. That Obama would bring all the different peoples together   &mdash;   and that publicity-seeking loudmouths like Gates would be laughed at rather than taken seriously. <br>
 <br>
The majority of Americans may well agree that Gates is a publicity-seeking loudmouth   &mdash;   but Pres. Obama has made it clear he does NOT. Obama insulted the police and took the side of the paranoid loud-talker who every morning upon waking checks for Klansmen under his bed. <br>
 <br>
Also, please note that &#8220;acting stupidly&#8221; was formerly known as &#8220;police doing their job.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
I predict this Gates fiasco will be the first of many painful lessons white liberals will receive until they finally learn that Obama is not ON their side. </p>
<p>And that being lectured to, scolded and punished by a black man for four years isn&rsquo;t actually as much fun as it sounds. <br>
 <br>
This president, far from being the postracial uniter he&rsquo;s constantly touted as, is in fact a pro-black radical whose Alinskyite worldview where &#8220;every cop is a criminal&#8221; (h/t: M.Jagger) will damage race relations far more than improve them. </p>
