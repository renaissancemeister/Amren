<h1>Illegal Immigrants Account for $10.7 Billion of Nation&rsquo;s Health Care Costs, Data Show</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Cover, CNS (Cybercast News Service) News, July 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that &#8220;illegal immigrants are not covered&#8221; in the health care reform legislation that is now working its way through House committees. But when asked about illegal immigrants who go to public hospitals for care, Pelosi told CNN&rsquo;s State of the Nation on Sunday the law requires that they be treated.</p>
<p>The cost of treating illegal aliens amounts to nearly $11 billion a year, according to calculations done by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a non-profit group that opposes illegal immigration. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re in this country illegally, should you be able to get health care?&#8221; CNN&rsquo;s John King asked Pelosi. &#8220;No, illegal immigrants are not covered by this plan,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so what happens to a public hospital then, if they walk into the emergency room? The hospital I was at this week, they said, you know, they do 6,000 births a year there and 70 percent of them are for undocumented [patients],&#8221; said King.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&#8221; said Pelosi. &#8220;But I do know that the law requires that if somebody comes in off the street and needs care, that is extended. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>According to FAIR&rsquo;s Director of Special Projects Jack Martin, illegal immigrants cost federal and state governments an estimated $10.7 billion a year in health care spending. The numbers are contained in a report that FAIR plans to publish in the near future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Each anchor baby costs taxpayers an estimated $10,000 each on average, Martin said. These costs are usually paid through Medicaid, the federal program designed to aid America&rsquo;s poor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Emergency room care for adults is another &#8220;significant&#8221; part of illegals&rsquo; overall burden, Martin said, one that is primarily borne by states, which subsidize the hospitals whose emergency rooms must treat illegal immigrants, no matter how minor their illness might be.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The CIS study did include federal programs for which illegal immigrants are legally barred, such as Medicaid. However, federal funds still flowed their way due to the fact that illegal immigrant parents gain access to federal welfare and health care benefits through their U.S.-born children.</p>
<p>According to the CIS study, illegals accounted for 13.1 percent of all federal costs of covering the uninsured in 2004, an estimated $2.2 billion per year. Seventeen percent of households headed by an illegal immigrant were using Medicaid, accounting for 1.7 percent of all Medicaid recipients.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The current health care bill is looking as if it is leaving a very large loophole for medical coverage being provided to illegal aliens,&#8221; Martin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s one provision that says they won&rsquo;t be eligible, but the current legislation as it&rsquo;s being written does not establish any system of verification as to whether or not a person is legal or illegal.&#8221;<br>

I have read posts on other places which claim that a true Christian would not let anyone, illegal or not, go without health treatment. Well, why not treat illegals and legal visitors just like Mexico treats their visitors. </p>
<p>If you need medical attention, pay up front. If it is truly, life and death, of course, save the life: then send them home!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why a hospital may not tirage the walk ins, and separate the true emergency from the mundane and send the later packing. If it is not truly an emergency, why mustthe hospital waste money?</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Pelosi&#8221;. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Speaker of the House of Representatives. She doesn&rsquo;t know. And she doesn&rsquo;t want to know.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m really sick of the various ways illegals are getting the benefits of citizens, and the many discussions of what to do about them&hellip;fences, roundups, raids, etc. We don&rsquo;t any more talk. Just announce in every language, especially Spanish, for them to go home or go to prison. Eisenhower had the guts to send the braceros home in the &rsquo;50s. What&rsquo;s the matter with those in charge today?  Illegals too profitable?</p>

		<p>Nancy is full of it; everyone knows that. And illegals are already covered by our national health plan. It&rsquo;s called Medicaid. Hospitals are closing and people are dying because of it, others losing their jobs, but heck, don&rsquo;t sweat the small details&hellip;</p>
<p>A few years back we were registering in a  hospital waiting room for my husband to have carpal tunnel surgery. The room was wall to wall Mexicans, Spanish and laughter filling the atrium. After registering, we were called to a small office off the waiting room to see the &#8216;Financial Counselor.&rsquo; She rattled off a bunch of our insurance co-pays, etc. and said we would have approximately  $1,200 applied to deductible; did we want to pay that by check or by credit card??? I looked at her, astounded, and said, &#8220;Let me get this straight. We HAVE insurance; you&rsquo;re automatically guaranteed 80% of our bill being paid if we don&rsquo;t pay you another dime, and you want us to PRE-PAY for surgery???&#8221; She stammered about hospital policy, etc., I interrupted her, and told her to cancel the surgery. It was elective, and he could wait till we could use the other hospital in town. She was astounded, and I finally demanded to see the hospital administrator. She stammered some more, got on the phone, and I got up and said loudly, &#8220;I want to speak to the hospital administrator! NOW!&#8221; A representative from the hospital showed up immediately, and in front of her and a room full of Mexicans, I explained what Ms. Collector had said, and I asked loudly, &#8220;You&rsquo;re guaranteed 80% of our bill when I sign that paper. Tell me, how much of THESE people&rsquo;s bills are you going to get? Most of them are illegal, they&rsquo;re not even supposed to  BE here; they&rsquo;re going to get their entire treatment for FREE! They&rsquo;re not required to pay a damn DIME, and you want us to pay UP FRONT?&#8221; </p>
<p>He quickly ushered us back into Ms. Collector&rsquo;s office and told her to forgo the deductible, they would bill us for all charges.</p>
<p>I was livid.</p>

		<p>I recently got sick, visited a local urgent care center .. not a hospital.. they did a chest xray, a biopsy, and charged me my 25 dollar copay. then later the bills came in. extra charges for the doctors exam, which was &#8220;too high&#8221; for the insurance to cover, 200 bucks for a xray, another 200 for a person in india to read the xray&hellip; and on and on&hellip;</p>
<p>lets face it they are milking us. </p>
<p>the next time I get sick. i&rsquo;m going to the public hospital and check in without a social security number and my name is Juan Valdez</p>
<p>nuff said</p>

		<p>Take a look at page 50 of H.R. 3200 and you will see that Pelosi is either a liar or stupid, or both.  Illegals will be covered.</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi is so compromised ethically, that I wouldn&rsquo;t trust her with a dirty pair of socks, let alone govern the nation.</p>
