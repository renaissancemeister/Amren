<h1><a href="https://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=reilly_rick&amp;id=4347419">Woods Needs to Clean Up His Act</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Reilly, ESPN the Magazine, July 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Tiger Woods] is 33 years old, married, the father of two. He is paid nearly $100 million a year to be the representative for some monstrously huge companies, from Nike to Accenture. He is the world&rsquo;s most famous and beloved athlete.</p>
<p>And yet he spent most of his two days at Turnberry last week doing the Turn and Bury. He&rsquo;d hit a bad shot, turn and bury his club into the ground in a fit. It was two days of Tiger Tantrums  &mdash;  slamming his club, throwing his club and cursing his club. In front of a worldwide audience.</p>
<p>A whole lot of that worldwide audience is kids. They do what Tiger does. They swing like Tiger, read putts like Tiger and do the celebration biceps pump like Tiger. Do you think for two seconds they don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s cool to throw their clubs like Tiger, too?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If there were no six-second delay, Tiger Woods would be the reason to invent it. Every network has been burned by having the on-course microphone open when he blocks one right into the cabbage and starts with the F-bombs. Once, at Doral, he unleashed a string of swear words at a photographer that would&rsquo;ve made Artie Lange blush, and then snarled, &#8220;&#8216;The next time a photographer shoots a [expletive] picture, I&rsquo;m going to break his [expletive] neck!&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disrespectful to the game, disrespectful to those he plays with and disrespectful to the great players who built the game before him. Ever remember Jack Nicklaus doing it? Arnold Palmer? When Tom Watson was getting guillotined in that playoff to Stewart Cink, did you see him so much as spit? Only one great player ever threw clubs as a pro  &mdash;  Bobby Jones  &mdash;  and he stopped in his 20s when he realized how spoiled he looked.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t new. Woods has been this way for years: swearing like a Hooters&rsquo; bouncer, trying to bury the bottom of his driver into the tee box, flipping his club end over end the second he realizes his shot is way offline.</p>
<p>I can still remember the 1997 Masters  &mdash;  arguably the most important golf tournament ever played. Woods, then 21, was playing the 15th hole on Sunday. He had just hit a fairway wood out of the rough and was watching it. A young boy came up from behind just to touch him  &mdash;  just to pat the back of this amazing new superhero. That&rsquo;s when Tiger pulled the club way back over his head and slammed it down, nearly braining the kid he couldn&rsquo;t see behind him. And this was with a huge lead.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re saying. We see more Tiger tantrums because TV shows every single shot he hits. And I&rsquo;m telling you: You&rsquo;re wrong. He is one of the few on Tour who do it. And I keep wondering when PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem is going to have the cojones to publicly upbraid him for it.</p>
<p>Golf is a gentlemen&rsquo;s game. Stomping and swearing and carrying on like a Beverly Hills tennis brat might fly in the NBA or in baseball or in football, where less is expected, but golf demands manners. It&rsquo;s your honor. Is my mark in your way? No, I had 6, not 5. Golfers call penalties on themselves. We are our own police. Tiger, police yourself.</p>

		<p>I suspect one of the reasons the interests shill for him is that he&rsquo;s one of the few black players and they don&rsquo;t want to be seen as picking on him. But probably more than that is he&rsquo;s a huge draw and makes them a lot of money. They don&rsquo;t want to risk losing that gravy train.</p>

		<p>As someone who&rsquo;s played a little golf, it had me stomping, swearing, and throwing my clubs too.</p>
<p>I played a golf tournament once with a group of teenagers. I ended up being paired with a couple of players who were the best in the area. All three guys I was paired with cheated like crazy. Every time a marker went down to mark a ball on the green (which was on ever hole it seemed) when the ball finally made it back down on the green it had been moved a foot or so closer to the hole. If they actually deducted strokes on their score, I don&rsquo;t know, who knows - didn&rsquo;t notice it being done. The golfer with the lowest score tees off first on the next hole, if I remember right. Thank goodness for that much honesty.  </p>

		<p>How can people worship someone who hits a little ball into a hole with a stick. Please, don&rsquo;t misunderstand. I know that people are fanatics about all kinds of things. Poker, baseball, chess, basketball, golf,etc. It&rsquo;s just that to get to the point of worshipping someone,is,I believe, abnormal.</p>

		<p>Well, here&rsquo;s a new revelation for me.  I didn&rsquo;t know all these bad behavior problems was going on, thanks to the minority, butt-kissing media who is supposed to report on these kinds of things.  They certainly wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to show one of the white players acting badly if that were the case.</p>
<p>This just tells us that blacks just can&rsquo;t handle civilization.  Yes, there are a FEW whites who behave badly but the sports world is rife with bad attitudes and deplorable behavior by blacks.  </p>
<p>I wonder when we&rsquo;re going to hear that his wife is divorcing him with photos of her and the mulatto children all throughout the newspapers and the scandal sheets.</p>
<p>I truly believe that we will reach a point soon when attitudes towards blacks change to one of distrust and distaste among the majority of the white population.</p>
<p>And, it will be the anti-white president making it clear to people that he is a black scam artist who is friends with almost every black white hater in the country, just like Henry Gates and Jeremiah Wright.</p>

		<p>Most Black athletes are cut in this mold although I am not a golf fan I&rsquo;ve noticed how the media portrays Tiger Woods.  The media highlights any Black athlete (or mulatto Black; actually mulatto Blacks are the standard media caricature to depict typical Blacks.) who has a White wife.  As a matter of fact when Tiger&rsquo;s blond-haired White wife had a baby it was highlighted on the front page of the New York Daily News, as if to display the wonderful beauty of Black men and their blond White women.  Headlines and portrayals such as these are the standard role call for young White girls to &#8220;go thou now and do likewise&#8221; as Dr. Pierce used to put it.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t suspect that good ole Tiger displayed behavior that was written about in this article.  It seems that even though he isn&rsquo;t a full-fledged &#8220;brutha&#8221;, he still can&rsquo;t shake the Black part of him.  If a White athlete behaved in this manner the media would be the first to chastise him.  However, like his &#8220;brutha&#8221; a Mr. Barry Soetoro, there&rsquo;s nothing he can do wrong in the media&rsquo;s eyes.  And they&rsquo;ll make darn sure that the average &#8216;Joe Sixpack&rsquo; sees it that way too.</p>

		<p>Wood&rsquo;s behavior confirms something I have observed for a long time. When Black men rise to extraordinary levels of success they self destruct. Whether OJ Simpson, Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson, Kwame Kilpatrick, or Michael Vick, sooner or later their true Black nature comes out, what some have called TNB (Typical Negro Behavior). <br>
I have been waiting for this to happen to Obama. When his agenda fails and the American people reject his socialist ideas and programs, he may have a nervous breakdown. He is not used to people disagreeing with him, it will be interesting to see how he responds. </p>

		<p>Only people that watch golf regularly and through the hole tourney see Eldrick behaving like a child.  Most people only see golf through the ESPN highlights, and they of course block out the tantrums and only show the trophies.  Methinks Rick Reilly isn&rsquo;t long for his job.</p>

<p>But isn&rsquo;t that what &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is all about?</p>
<p>Comrades: Tiger, Obama, and Dr. Skip, are what this society has come to be expected, or even required, to emulate. To not do so, is to be a &ldquo;racist&rdquo; and a &ldquo;degenerate!&rdquo; It is not that they are human beings in the same manner that whites are, but that they are miraculous supermen of exceptional considerations, to be given: white women; a White House; 100 million dollar contracts; and special (even extraordinary) &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; by the police to do whatever they want. </p>
<p>The sky is the limit for such godlike ebony beings, and what normal child (white, Hispanic, Asian, or black) would not want to be included in such rainbow privileges?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all; and just look, look in wonder, at all the pretty colors:</p>

		<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s never been about the skill of the athlete, but how polite he is. What? Sounds like a PC moral crusade to me, no matter what race the target is. If that&rsquo;s what side you&rsquo;re on, great, but don&rsquo;t get mad when it comes back to bite you in the butt when you want to talk about realism.</p>

		<p>if you check the history of sports, you will find that it came from the Victorian era.  It was the idea of sportsmanship and a good example to the young men as in playing the game fairly being more important than winning.  It came from the last phase of chivalric dueling - as in the 18th-19th century duel of honor with swords or later on - pistols.  Sportsmanship then, derived from that very old Western tradition of honor and deportment in adversity, the protection of the weak, (women and children) etc.</p>
<p>What a perversity of this it has been to view the changes in behavior in all sports, but especially American professional sports, since intergration!  The key to the Decline of the West is at least in large part the loss of the ideal of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct.  Now it is grab the dough (however you can get it) and blow! These &#8220;beloved&#8221; athletes are made so when they are black - part of the self-flagelating society we have lived in for four decades.  They can now rape or kill a White woman and make a public spectical of getting away with it.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much they take steroids or otherwise cheat the system.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times they get arrested or contribute to the decline of civilizaiton.  So how can anyone chide Woods, who after all, is only acting as most overpaid, overhyped, over-rewarded athletes usually do&hellip;.</p>

		<p>This has been known for years, but most, well, basically all of the MSM ignores it. No white player could get away this. Not one. In any sport. Not even in MMA where the alpha male whites are for the most part making a mockery of non-white fighters. A white fighter has a tirade, he&rsquo;s a hell, he needs to apologize (Lesnar). A black fighter has a tirade, and he&rsquo;s a &#8216;character&rsquo;, he&rsquo;s honest, he has passion, he&rsquo;s keeping it real (Rampage Jackson). </p>

		<p>     The PGA has warned him several times about his bouts of temper, but tv ratings trump gentlemanly conduct. One of the commentators on the Golf Channel noted that when he doesn&rsquo;t play or has missed the cut, the ratings go way down. He also hinted that golf needs him if it is to survive. Baloney !</p>

		<p>&#8220;golf is a gentleman&rsquo;s game.&#8221; Oh please. Plenty of players swear(as in baseball, &#8220;America&rsquo;s Pastime&#8221;. Some drink while on the course, like thousands of gentlemen who are weekend golfers and a famous pro golfer or two(guess who?).  If you are looking for perfect role models in any business, including sports, go to another planet. Most of the time Woods plays great golf, and acts as well as his fellow golfers. And when he doesn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;s no worse than the golferss he plays with-the best from an assortment of nations, most of whom are Caucasians. So what&rsquo;s the point of this being in AR?</p>

		<p>When the history of our era is written, the fate of white people will have been decided. In the case of white success I&rsquo;m sure historians will observe it was correlated with a steep decline in white interest in watching sports. </p>
<p>There are so many other things to do with your time. If alternatives don&rsquo;t come easily then put some discipline and effort into finding other things to do. Do it for the benefit of your fellow whites.  </p>

		<p>Well, this is truly hilarious - and timely. I had just been mentioning to my family that whenever golf coverage is on the news or the tv anywhere(what little I even see in passing), it is always Tiger Woods first and foremost&hellip;and everyone else afterward! No matter if he is in first place, the middle of the pack or last, whether he&rsquo;s got a bum knee or is healthy and fit, it&rsquo;s always &#8220;Tiger, Tiger, Tiger&hellip;&#8221; ad naseum!</p>
<p>And now this! As &#8220;ranger&#8221; noted above, since I do not follow golf at all I had never heard a whisper of this. Never a word of admonsihment for this obnoxious behavior! It is remarkable the degree to which even the most unlikely Blacks seem destined to live up to those pesky old stereotypes that are just too valid to die! </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t even see the point of Amren posting this article. So Tiger Woods is a hot head? So what? Is his behavior supposed to be indicative of Black behavior? I want to point out, as I have before, that Tiger Woods is not really Black. He is only 1/4 Black. He is also 1/2 Asian and 1/8 White and 1/8 Amerindian. Amren has pointed out that Asians are the least temperamental people. I don&rsquo;t see how highlighting the actions of one spoiled sports star really has any relevance to race relations or the causes for European peoples.</p>

		<p>This is mistaken. I have never heard a Hooters bouncer swear. Nor have I heard a bouncer at a strip club swear. Even the bouncers that threw me out of the Las Vegas casino were very polite!<br>
   Maybe they only act this way in front of a drunk sportswriter.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the article had anything to do with racism, per se.  Misbehavior, yes.  And, we know that what can be gratuitously asserted can be gratuitously denied.  Care to elaborate with specifics on your accusation?</p>

		<p> With the totally uncritical approach of most of the sports&rsquo; media, I was aware of Mr. Woods&rsquo;s unsportsmanlike behavior  &mdash;  &#8220;it was two days of Tiger Tantrums &mdash; slamming his club, throwing his club and cursing his club in front of a worldwide audience.&#8221; While Tiger Woods is one of the all time greatest golfers, his other behavior on the greens doesn&rsquo;t speak well of him as a role model and popular media idol. </p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, this is a lot different from the usual adoring coverage I see. A few weeks ago he was doing lousy in a tournament, so the announcers showed a clip from the prior year, when he beat one of the white players in a playoff. &#8220;</p>
<p>Yes, this is a weird thing that the networks will do.  I was over at a friend&rsquo;s house last year and he was watching some NCAA football game.  The black QB was doing terrible, so the network started showing clips from a video game of this QB making all sorts of great plays.  A VIDEO GAME!!

		<p>  It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much money they make, or where they live, blacks will resort back to their typical black behavior. I&rsquo;ve known several VERY successful black men, and they all resort to the same old black mentality. It is ingrained in their genes. Blacks do not, nor will they ever, act like white people. Whites must someday realize that it is impossible for whites and blacks to co-exist in close proximity of one another. We must separate in order for both races to achieve harmony in their lives. Integration is wrong and unnatural. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t follow professional sports, but it&rsquo;s impossible not to know who Tiger Woods is. I was unaware that he behaved in such a way, so maybe there is something to be said for the media burying it. As one poster has already mentioned, John McEnroe never got a break - I&rsquo;ve never watched a tennis match in my life, but I knew right away what sort of childish behavior the McEnroe post alluded to. </p>
<p>As for the golfing greats of years past (Nicklaus, Palmer, Kite, Zoeller, etc.), their gentlemanly behavior was the result of immense self-discipline. I grew up on an Arnold Palmer golf course, and I worked on a famous golf course during and after college: I&rsquo;ve personally heard Arnold Palmer curse on the practice tee. However, in the public eye? Never. Self-discipline. </p>
<p>How many of those who worship Tiger Woods for his &#8220;blackness&#8221; have any idea who Calvin Peete is? Long before Woods and his rock-star status, Calvin Peete was one of the most accurate pros in the PGA. Calvin Peete held himself to the same standards of gentlemanly decorum that his fellow PGA pros did. Self-discipline. </p>
<p>Tiger Woods is nothing but a poster child of the society we&rsquo;ve allowed to flourish. A man&rsquo;s true self emerges under stress, and Woods is no different. He isn&rsquo;t the polished, heavenly, immaculate super-pro that the fawning, brainwashed, black-loving, PC media would have us believe he is&hellip;he&rsquo;s a self-centered, tempermental billionaire who takes himself too seriously and therefore has no sense that the rules of decorum apply to him. </p>
<p>The real indictment here isn&rsquo;t Woods&rsquo; brash display of childish tantrums. For that he&rsquo;s no different than any other rock star or professional athlete, white or black. What&rsquo;s most damning here is that, once again, the PC media has re-created a black man (Woods) into some false demigod that no white person may question. </p>

<p>Quite Professional, your brilliant statements are on point!  I myself cannot believe that soooo many people place so much emphasis on these empty sports heroes of the likes of Tiger Woods, Allen Iverson, Steve McNair (now deceased due to his own stupidity), and that OJ Simpleton (who I believe to this very day butchered his ex-wife) just to name a few!  </p>
<p>It does not surprise me that Woods would throw such tandrums but that it has taken so long for his outbursts to finally come to the light of the day.  I for one do not idolize Tiger Woods and do not care for the other characters in the sports world of his ilk.  </p>

		<p>   Pro golf is in fact a gentleman&rsquo;s sports.  I grew up less than 3 miles from the Augusta National Golf Club and had the opportunity to go to a number of Masters Tournaments in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s.  The self control of 95% of the golfers was amazing. The ones that did throw tantrums  seldom or never won major tournaments.  The recent news of Tiger Woods is nothing new to me.  Having watched a number of tournaments in recent years, I have seen him pout and act immaturely a number of times.  As if he is entitled to win every tournament.  He is spoiled, and can&rsquo;t conceal it.  The media is grotesque in it&rsquo;s worship of the black athlete- Tiger is represented as being black even though he is mixed race.  He is worshipped by that sort of stupid, non-thinking sports fanatic that only loves a &#8220;winner&#8221;, no matter how obnoxious that &#8220;winner&#8221;  may be.  </p>

		<p>With his lack of impulse control and his usual black anger, if Woods&rsquo; wife ever tries to leave him look for him to kill her, ala O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown, plus dozens of other black males who kill their white wives when the are eventually rejected.</p>
<p>He has the basic ingredients to lose it, the first time he&rsquo;s badly rejected.</p>

		<p>I never watch sports on television, except judo. And no matter how excellent they are, judo athletes, or judoka, aren&rsquo;t in it for the money, believe me.</p>
<p>I never liked Tiger Woods, in any way; I always thought he was WAY overhyped. And I remember (I think it was in 1999) Tiger was the person pf the Year, in Time magazine, and the jewish writers had compared to people like Mozart, among other geniuses&hellip; I almost wanted to throw up.</p>
<p>Tiger Woods is a creature created by the media! And I don&rsquo;t care how well he plays golf: his only contribution to civilization is posong for pictures, making big smiles, while characteristically wearing a cap and his little polo shirts buttoned all the way up to his collar bone!</p>

		<p>I just don&rsquo;t get what the big deal is about Woods. I never have and I never will. Look at the huge fortune he has made in endorsements! I just don&rsquo;t get that at all. What are those marketing executives thinking? Do they really think I&rsquo;m going to go out and buy a $40,000.00 gas guzzling SUV because Woods say&rsquo;s &#8220;what did you expect Igor&#8221;, in some stupid assinine commercial? Do they really think that? Note too how Woods used his money and status to snag a beautiful blonde. She of course has betrayed (and ended) her White blood-line for money. </p>
