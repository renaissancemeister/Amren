			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandra Block and Laura Petrecca, USA Today, July 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Many Americans fear they&rsquo;ll outlive their savings, but African Americans and Hispanics face an even greater risk of spending the end of their lives in poverty.</p>
<p>Members of those two groups are less likely than white and Asian workers to participate in their employers&rsquo; 401(k) plans, and when they do contribute, they save less, according to a study scheduled for release today by Ariel Education Initiative and Hewitt Associates.</p>
<p>African Americans and Hispanics also are much more likely to take money out of their 401(k) plans for emergencies, which could further stunt long-term savings growth. And they are less likely to invest in stocks in favor of low-risk investments and real estate, increasing the risk that their savings won&rsquo;t keep pace with inflation, retirement specialists say.</p>
<p>The survey, which analyzed data from nearly 3 million employees at the end of 2007, found significant differences in retirement savings even among higher-income employees. White workers who made $120,000 or more had an average balance of $223,408 in their 401(k) plans, vs. $154,902 for African Americans in the same salary range.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s bear market wiped out 27% of the typical worker&rsquo;s 401(k) plan, according to Fidelity Investments, forcing millions of Americans to save more, delay retirement or both. Many Americans have increased their savings rate in recent months, even as many employers have reduced or eliminated matches to 401(k) plans. But the Ariel/Hewitt study indicates that African Americans and Hispanics will have to save at a significantly faster pace than others to have a chance at a comfortable retirement .</p>
<p>The survey&rsquo;s authors say the savings gap among races can be closed by automatically enrolling workers in 401(k) plans, improving financial literacy and giving workers more time to repay 401(k)-plan loans. Why African Americans and Hispanics are falling behind, according to Ariel/Hewitt:</p>
<p>Inexperience</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Competing obligations</p>
<p>African Americans and Hispanics typically have less wealth than whites, says Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. When they&rsquo;re in a &#8220;race to meet the monthly bills,&#8221; she says, saving is a lower priority.</p>
<p>African Americans and Hispanics also are less likely to inherit money than whites, Munnell says, which leaves less of a financial cushion against hard times. As a result, she says, these groups have a tougher time putting money in a retirement account and also tend to be more cautious about investing in the unpredictable stock market.</p>
<p>Minorities also may be held back by family obligations, says Monique Morrissey, economist at the Economic Policy Institute. If a worker comes from a demographic group that has been disadvantaged over generations, she says, the individual is more likely to be responsible for family members.</p>
<p>Lack of trust</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African-American workers are less likely than other workers to invest in stocks, which could limit the long-term growth of their savings, according to the Ariel/Hewitt study.</p>
<p>Overall, African-American workers invest 66% of their 401(k)s in stocks, vs. 70% for Hispanics and 72% for whites. African-American employees ages 30 to 49  &mdash;  considered the prime ages for investing in stocks  &mdash;  were the most conservative.</p>
<p>Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments, a Chicago-based mutual fund company, has studied African-American attitudes toward investing for years and says her research suggests that many equate investing in the stock market with gambling.</p>
<p>Years like last year, she adds, &#8220;reinforced this point of view, when you see these wild rides and massive volatility.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we do invest, we prefer real estate, outside of an employer-sponsored retirement plan,&#8221; says Hobson, who is black. &#8220;And when we do save, we favor more conservative investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Older Hispanics also are less likely to trust financial markets, says Jay Rossi, principal of multicultural marketing firm DDR Global. &#8220;They hold onto money and invest in tangible things that one can touch, see and manage, such as real estate and cars. The whole idea of putting money into the hands of professional money managers is relatively new.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Higher withdrawal rates</p>
<p>African Americans are more than twice as likely as whites or Asians to take a hardship withdrawal from their 401(k) plans. The withdrawal rate also was higher for Hispanics, although not as high as African Americans&rsquo;. Asians had the lowest rate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An employee who takes a $10,000 hardship withdrawal from his retirement account could have to pay out more than one-third of the money in taxes and early-withdrawal penalties, Edwards says.</p>
<p>In addition, she says, the withdrawal permanently would reduce the amount of money available to grow and compound. Assuming an average annual return of 8%, a 45-year-old employee who takes a $10,000 hardship withdrawal would reduce his account balance at age 65 by nearly $47,000, according to an analysis by Towers Perrin. A 35-year-old worker who takes a $10,000 hardship withdrawal would reduce her account balance at 65 by more than $100,000.</p>
<p>African Americans and Hispanics also are more likely to borrow money from their 401(k) plans than white and Asian workers, the study states.</p>
<p>Borrowing from a 401(k) plan won&rsquo;t hurt the employees&rsquo; retirement savings if the worker repays the money, Hobson says.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t consider real estate a low-risk investment, especially after the recent market plunge.</p>
<p>Part of this can be explained this way IMHO:  If a black man or woman is working for a living, and builds up a little nest egg, they&rsquo;re going to have relatives they never even knew existed put their hands out.  Plus, they themselves have a tendency to splurge.</p>

		<p>Is it me or have Asians been discriminated against for generations, yet they still manage to leave their 401k&rsquo;s alone.  Kind of like Hong Kong being under the imperial grip of the British only to emerge and flower, just like Kenya!!!!  Or, maybe not.  </p>
<p>How much more stating the obvious is it going to take to wake up the multicultural left?   Yes, there are some very smart, hardworking blacks with Eurocentric values, and I have almost no problem with them.  But the majority is a bunch of irrational, superstitious children with a long malicious streak. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a retired new car dealer who represented a fair number of manufacturers, from mass market to high line brands.</p>
<p>Anybody in that business, like anybody in the home mortgage business, is well aware of the general financial irresponsibiity of blacks.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are many with prudent financial management instincts, but they are in a distinct minority.  Most have bureau scores that place them in high-interest contracts, when they can be financed at all.</p>
<p>Thus far the credit bureau rating systems somewhat protect lenders from imprudent loan practices. The current criminal administration in Washington seeks to suspend use of these very legitimate lending criteria, forcing all borrowers to bear the burden of irresponsible minorities.</p>

		<p>Blacks of any age cannot control their impulses. A simple experiment that is performed in elementary shcool classrooms proves this. In the experiment, children are offered a small candy bar, and they are told that they may have the small candy bar today or, if they decline, they may have a larger candy bar tomorrow. Black students are twice as likely to accept the immediate gratification of the small candy bar. This same mentality plays out over and over when blacks reach adulthood, with disastrous results.  </p>

		<p>From Post # 7: &#8220;Most of the white middle class I know are beat down financially and CAN&rsquo;T save enough.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The reason that many working people cannot save any money is because we are being taxed at nearly 50% of our earnings.  Federal, State, and City taxes are only a portion of your taxes.  When you include, Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, gasoline, phone, sales, hotel, airline, and property taxes, added to all the &#8220;fees&#8221; and &#8220;charges&#8221; such as car registration, gun registration, drivers license, building permits, business permits, building inspection, utility-connection fees, road and bridge tolls, and all other fees and charges, it all adds up to about 50% of everything you earn.  The government tells us that they have to deduct 15% of our income (Social Security tax) to support us in our old age, but if they just left us alone, we would be able to save and support ourselves in our old age.  Excessive government taxes makes us poor, which then requires that we become wards of the State!  The government then builds this giant, inefficient bureaucracy to &#8220;manage&#8221; our money. </p>

		<p>I have lived around and worked with blacks all my life.  They really ARE more generous to their family and friends than most whites.  Their social networks are larger than whites, too. (Think church, baby-fathers, cousins, aunties, and so on&hellip;) The flip side is that they expect that their friends, family   &mdash;   and the government   &mdash;   will be there to help them out when they need help.  So instead of saving for themselves, they &#8220;invest&#8221; in their social networks and trust the government will take care of them in their old age. </p>

		<p>Depending on what they are, these days &#8220;conservative&#8221; investments would probably fare better.  This may not be something to criticize, as I think stocks (and everything else but items of real value, like gold, food, fuel, land, etc.) are going to tank soon.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t put a dime (assuming I had one to invest) in the stock market these days, not for long-term gain, anyway.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity comments that &#8220;they&rsquo;re going to have relatives they never even knew existed put their hands out.&#8221; <br>
This is so true! I was listening to NPR (usually a mistake) and this African author was explaining how African immigrants in The West have relatives back in Africa who think that anyone who migrates to the US or Europe is automatically rich. &#8220;Where is my car, where is my enrollment in school?&#8221; her relatives ask. In addition to expecting &#8220;the village&#8221; to pay for everything, Africans all over completely fail to understand basic economics and think in terms only of the shortest time horizons.<br>
She was Kenyan too. I wonder if our new president will heed the call from his homeland &#8220;where are our cars, where is our health care&#8221; etc etc</p>

Need I say more, And what is sad is all these white kids emulating, imitating, and mirroring this culture, they have been told to have no pride in themselves and embrace this degeneration.  Just sickening. Kids from good homes good neighborhoods all wanting to pretend like they are poor and have no class or values Oh yeah! and to be a thug!!!! We have lost our tradition of not traveling the path of least resistance, but instead doing what is Right!  Now we just give in to this mindless behavior.</p>

<p>I suspect not   &mdash;   not if he has any sense, that is (and I think he does). In the first place, he&rsquo;s never been close to them anyway. But especially because he has nothing at all to gain from them, politically, while he would have a lot to lose here. If American voters/taxpayers learned of a stream of gifts flowing to Kenya, they would be outraged.  </p>
<p>Africans, in their countries,  may think of The Big Man as a dictator who rules as he pleases and doesn&rsquo;t give a damn for the public, but American politicians have to keep an alert  ear tuned to public opinion.  And the American public is fickle! They have turned against many other politicians when the initial infatuation was over. A love affair one year can become a hate fest the next.</p>

		<p>The only answer to such a problem is self-discipline. The media acts as if Whites are born with certain special skills that somehhow magically elude those of other races. My Grandfather immigrated to this country as a child, attended school through the 7th grade. His parents spoke no English, and yet he managed to decrypt the world of mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and banking. In Africa, they call it muti, or juju. The Africans think that Whites simply possess powers that others do not. They are correct, but it is IQ, not magic. </p>
<p>My neighborhood is solidly middle class. We have several black families on our block (by that I mean a baby-momma and some kids with several different daddies). My neighbor is a lawyer, his wife a stay-at-home mom. They drive Honda&rsquo;s. Every black face in this neighborhood drives a Mercedes, Lexus, or Hummer with tricked out rims costing THOUSANDS per wheel. </p>
<p>My neighbor and I talk about investments, our retirement funds, 401k plans. We spend time online doing research. Our neighborhood blacks spend time spending money. They could choose to control themselves, but they will not. I refuse to pick up the tab for 40 million people who simply refuse to develop basic self restraint.</p>

		<p>When I was a kid in the Hudson Valley in New York, the old Hudson Valley Calvinists had a saying: &#8220;A tenth to the Church, a tenth to the bank, you live off what&rsquo;s left.&#8221;  This way anyone can save, be he Black, White, or Purple.</p>
<p>The problem with the minorities is that they tend to buy cars and houses which are far bigger than they can afford, or need.  And, of course, they blame it on Whitey when everything comes crashing in on them.</p>
