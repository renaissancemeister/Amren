<h1>Sexual Barriers May Up HIV Risk in Black Gay Men</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan Rauscher, Reuters, July 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While black Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, most studies have found that black gay men don&rsquo;t engage in higher risk sexual activity any more frequently than other gay men, H. Fisher Raymond and Willi McFarland of the San Francisco Department of Public Health point out in a report in the journal AIDS and Behavior.</p>
<p>To study the influence of social and sexual mixing between racial and ethnic groups of gay men in San Francisco, Raymond and McFarland interviewed 1,142 gay men. Fifty-six percent were white, 22% Latino, 14% Asian and 9% black. The men reported on a total of 3,532 sexual partnerships.</p>
<p>They found that black gay men were three times more likely to have sexual partners that were also black, than would be expected by chance alone.</p>
<p>In addition, black gay men were the least preferred of sexual partners by other races and were believed to be riskier to have sex with, which can lead to men of other races avoiding black men as sexual partners.</p>
<p>Black gay men were also counted less often among friends and were perceived as less welcome at the common venues that cater to gay men in San Francisco by other gay men.</p>
<p>These influences, Raymond told Reuters Health, push black gay men closer together in smaller social and sexual networks  &mdash;  &#8220;networks that are already at higher risk for HIV infection merely because the background prevalence of HIV is higher than in other groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The racial disparity in HIV observed for more than a decade,&#8221; Raymond and McFarland conclude in their report, &#8220;will not disappear until the challenges posed by a legacy of racism toward blacks in the U.S. are addressed.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is interesting. As an openly gay Black man who is attractive and in good shape, I have had a number of White men and some Hispanic and Asian men (mostly White)approach me for sex. A number of these men have been married men as well.</p>
<p>This study may be somewhat skewed.</p>

<p>So they WANT gay men of other races to have higher HIV rates like the blacks?  Maybe the real reason black gay men have a higher HIV rate is because they do indeed engage in higher risk sexual activity and just lied about it.  Everyone knows the HIV and STD rates of blacks is much higher than any other race.  That has nothing to do with racism but rather with a lack of self control and plain stupidity on the blacks part in not using protection.</p>

		<p>What jumps out at me is the racism of non-black gay men in San Francisco.  After all, they tend to vote for the political party that is so opposed to racism, to the point of integrating schools, neighborhoods, and other things.  They&rsquo;re so opposed to racism that firefighter tests have to be disposed of because blacks tend to get lower scores.  The integration that&rsquo;s good for the goose is also good for the gander of the gay bath house.</p>

		<p>Hey look, it&rsquo;s the AIDS version of stereotype threat!  I looked at the full article which was helpfully linked, and there&rsquo;s no other way to describe the findings.  </p>
<p>It basically says: gay blacks have &#8220;lower risk&#8221; sexual behavior than whites, and so should have less HIV, but gay whites believed (erroneously) that blacks had greater rates of it.  Irony of ironies, this wrongful belief caused HIV to spread like wildfire among blacks.  </p>
<p>So, to atone for this damaging prejudice, the authors impliedly suggest that gay whites consider relationships with blacks to &#8220;spread the AIDS around,&#8221; to paraphrase BHO.  Since there&rsquo;s no cure for AIDS, I don&rsquo;t know how how else a breaking down of these social barriers between gay blacks and whites would cause the AIDS gap to &#8220;disappear.&#8221;</p>

		<p>WHAT?! First they say &#8220;black gay men don&rsquo;t engage in higher risk sexual activity any more frequently than other gay men&#8221; then they go on to say that black men have sky-high AIDS rates. So that can only mean that black men DO engage in high-risk sex, i.e., they have sex with other black men! That&rsquo;s high risk! But their reasoning for this high rate of AIDS is sheer insanity. Uninfected &#8220;racist&#8221; whites won&rsquo;t have sex with them! It&rsquo;s Whitey&rsquo;s fault again! Of course! If we all just quit being so darned racist and let blacks have sex with us, then they wouldn&rsquo;t be forced to have sex with EACH OTHER. We just can&rsquo;t win. </p>

		<p>Where I live, we had a scandal where more than 30 men were busted back in April for having sex in the local park with one another. Of the group, all but five were White. All but four were married or had &#8220;girlfriends.&#8221; Obviously for cover.</p>
<p>There is a lot more interracial sex and behind the scene sex taking place than is being reported. It is a disgrace.</p>

<p>Sounds like non-White gay men already know what black women haven&rsquo;t learned - that black males are the cause of their group&rsquo;s huge disparity in AIDS rates among women. </p>
<p>It probably has a lot to do with the whole &#8220;downlow&#8221; gay lifestyle which manifests itself differently in the black culture than mainstream gay culture (as is the case in non-gay culture too).</p>

		<p>A few years ago, I would not have beleived that intteracial gay sex was happening with any degree of frequency. However, the arrest of Florida congressmen Bob Allen in 2007 for having sex in public parks with Black men should have confirmed to us that White gay men and Black gay men do engage in sex with one another be it public or in private settings.</p>

		<p>The fact is that it is the mainstream media that promotes this digusting image of interracial homosexual sex. The former HBO television program Six Feet Under had a interracial gay male couple. Another HBO program True Blood has a Black gay character who is involved with a prominent White Louisiana State Senator. A few years ago, the NBC program Law and Order had plotline where a married White detective was involved in an undercover sexual relationship with a Black man. </p>
<p>It has been done very sneakily, but the media has been a major contributor to this glorification of homosexuality and interracial straight and gay sex. </p>

		<p>I suppose like hetero couples, there are a few gay couples who like to be able to have an intelligent conversation with one another. Do you think race might prove an obstacle to such couples even if they are &#8220;sexually compatible&#8221;?</p>

<p>So what, once more non-blacks get HIV there will be equality?<br>
Or non-black gays are racist for avoiding this riskier group?<br>
Geez, I thought risk prevention would be a desirable quality to be encouraged in this group.</p>
<p>Same song, different tune.<br>
And another chicken/ egg scenario.</p>
<p>Group A is riskier because group B discriminates against them.<br>
But instead of educating group A to be less risky, taunt/guilt group B into absorbing group A, to hopefully reduce group A&rsquo;s casualties.<br>
The collateral damages cost being some increase in group B fatalities, but who cares they&rsquo;re not black. </p>
<p>Again the way is shown, that to raise one group results you lower the other groups results.</p>
<p>The practical way to be in life is &#8220;Once bitten twice shy&#8221;, &#8220;fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me&#8221; or &#8220;the wise man learns from others mistakes&#8221;.</p>
<p>And in this way profiling, stereotyping or pre-judging is the result. Yet the politically correct brigade wants us to take away obvious variables to base our judgements on.</p>
<p>Unless of course you are a non-white, then of course you&rsquo;ll be exercising your &#8216;wisdom&rsquo; in identity politics.</p>
<p>Being politically correct is apparently deadly.</p>

		<p>As a gay conservative, I agree with Richard. Gay people are THE most liberal people on earth. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m shunned by most of them because of my &#8220;views&#8221; on life in general and, likewise, I also shun them. I&rsquo;m also of the opinion that ALOT of White gay males actively seek out black men for sex, I may be wrong, but that&rsquo;s just from what I&rsquo;ve personally seen. Anyway, thanks Amren for being here for me all these years. I probably would&rsquo;ve lost my sanity long ago had it not been for this site and the people who post here. GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU!  </p>

		<p>I used to have lots of gay male friends in the 1980s, they are all dead of AIDS, however.  My guess would be that many white gays are willing to have anonymous sex (in a park or bathroom) with black partners, but are relatively unwilling to invite black gays to their home to spend the night.  Probably a lot of white gays strongly prefer to have longer-term relationships and to avoid having sex in public areas altogether, especially as they get older.  Many of the more cautious white gays have no doubt heard horror stories of extreme violence, heavy substance abuse, pilfering of jewelry, money, credit cards, etc., &#8220;borrowing&#8221; of cars without permission from those gays who have been less cautious about inviting black strangers over to spend the night.  Letting black one-night stands see your &#8220;stuff&#8221; and learn that you are out of the apartment all day, every day, Monday - Friday is likely to lead to a break-in sooner rather than later.  Giving a white lover a key to your place is risky, giving a black lover a key is even riskier.  </p>
<p>Others have mentioned that blacks are more likely to be in denial about being homosexual (the downlow lifestyle), and are more likely to tell less than the whole truth to survey takers.  Both are undoubtedly true, and being in denial about your sexuality can cause you to behave stupidly.  If you aren&rsquo;t honest with yourself about being in the market for gay sex, you are less likely to buy condoms ahead of time, and more likely to get yourself high or drunk before you engage in sex, so that you can pretend to yourself later that &#8220;it never happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, in my experience, blacks are just bigger all-around partiers than white people, and are much more likely to abuse alcohol and drugs.  With drugs and alcohol, you get a lowering of inhibitions, etc., and safe sex no doubt goes out the window, as does saying &#8220;no&#8221; to people you might otherwise have the wisdom to regard as &#8220;riskier than average.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Black impulsiveness and the black pattern of failing to plan ahead are probably additional hidden factors for increased AIDS in the black community.  It may also be true that a white disinclination to invite blacks to their home as the start of a possible longer relationship makes black gays more likely to engage in one-night stands even if they might prefer longer-term relationships.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m suspicious of the whole study.  My guess would be that the black gays have a larger number of partners starting at an earlier age, just as black straight males do, leading to a higher STD rate for black gays, just as black straights have a higher STD rate than white straights.  </p>
<p>Black gays are more likely to have done serious prison time than white gays, and they are probably more likely to have had sexual relations with another man for money.  Lots of white gays don&rsquo;t really become sexually active until their college years.  If blacks start significantly younger, and I&rsquo;ll bet that they do, they may already have HIV by the time they are mature enough to start trying to practice safer sex.  </p>

		<p>The biggest myth is that you can educate men to use condoms to have safe sex. Using a condom is like wearing a raincoat while taking a shower. You shouldn&rsquo;t expect men to regularly use condoms. We hear it all the time - do whatever sex you like but wear a condom. Well, it&rsquo;s not happening and it never will.</p>

<p>No Howard, you misquoted me.  What I said is that it&rsquo;s taboo among most European-American (and other non-black) homosexual men to cavort with a black man.  And I also said that most gay men are not far-left, politically correct lemmings as is often assumed.

<p>So if more gay Whites had sex with HIV infected Blacks then there would be more parity in AIDS rates? Well, that&rsquo;s some sound logic right there. We can apply that to almost any other disparity that involves Blacks:</p>
<p>Blacks have the highest violent crime rate and also have the highest victimization rates. Whites smartly avoid Blacks because of this, which leads Blacks to be around each other more, thus leading to higher Black on Black crime and more Black victims. Solution: Whites should stop being so racist and spend more time with Blacks, which will allow Whites to be victimized at a rate equal to Blacks.</p>
<p>Also, Blacks have an IQ 15 points lower than Whites. Whites, for the most part, don&rsquo;t breed with Blacks. This leads to a never ending cycle of low IQ Black babies as so many Blacks are forced to breed with each other. Solution: Whites need to stop being so racist and have more babies with Blacks so that eventually the IQs will be equal for both races.</p>
<p>Wait, I was being sarcastic, but now that I think about it, this seems to be the actual liberal agenda. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with homosexual behavior. But as long as someone is conservative, discrete and not trying to recruit or push a militant agenda then I leave well enough alone. But I think everyone here can see that we have a dog in this fight. If we let those leftwing extremists advance their agenda at the expense of homosexuals then they will only use that momentum against the rest of us later.</p>

		<p>it is very taboo to date a black man in the gay community, not just for whites, but asians and latins as well, the ones that do engage with blacks are usually drunks or drug addicts, not the decent ones, that is my opinion, when blacks try to talk to me, i simply leave the area, having sex in parks is disgusting, san fransisco is the armpit of the earth, people, gay or straight should hold themselves accountable, one thing i do know, blacks make up 19 percent of virginia, but account for 68 percent of all aids cases, you can check the facts</p>

<p>I am not usre what social cirlcs you hang in, but the fact is that Gays are the most liberal group out there. Did anyone see Thursday&rsquo;s USA TODAY?</p>
<p>There is a gay male early 30ish couple in Iowa who recently got married. Both clean cut professionals. They had an adopted son who was the ring bearer in the wedding. Guess what race he was? <br>
He was a six year old Black child! </p>
<p>I have heard similar stories about gays and lesbians adopting non-White children.     </p>

		<p>Blacks top the charts in STD&rsquo;s. Why would it be any different for black gays then it is for blacks heteros? Blacks are the most promiscuous people, behaviour rooted in their impulsivenes, lower I.Q.&rsquo;s and inability to delay immediate gratification.</p>

<p>I question these types of surveys which only involve self reporting and self admissions.</p>
<p>How easy is it to deny you&rsquo;re involved in high risk behavior? How many people when asked are going to admit to putting themselves and others at risk?</p>
<p>These types of surveys are suspect to me.</p>

		<p>Bill,</p>
<p>Regarding the gay White professional couple with the non-White child&hellip;the reason is because they got the bottom of the barrel  &mdash;  -I think it&rsquo;s safe to assume that any couple, straight or gay, who adopts wants a blond or red-haired European American child and apparently this couple preferred to adopt rather than find a surrogate mother.  Personally, if I were to have a child, I&rsquo;d want it to be mine, and would find a way to have a child with my own genes, but NEVER would I adopt a non-White child.  Keep in mind that the leftwing media slants everything and while this couple may have chosen to make themselves even more different than they already are by adopting a non-White child, I seriously doubt most gay couples would do this.  </p>
<p>My main point is, don&rsquo;t necessarily believe anything the media says!!!!</p>

		<p>I read this twice because I just couldn&rsquo;t believe that anyone sane wrote this.  It&rsquo;s saying black men are more likely to sleep within their own race because of racism against them which in turn leads to them contracting HIV at a higher rate than White gays.  To combat this racism White gays must sleep with more blacks and spread the HIV around more equitably.  </p>

<p>The fact is that you have White heterosexual couples adopting Black children. What would make you believe that gays, who, on the whole, tend to be more liberal than the rest of the popualtion, would not do the same thing?</p>
<p>I am glad that you have te views that you do, but you are most likely in the minority for your community. The fact is that gays an lesbians are more inclined toward liberal ideology. It is just a fact.</p>

<p>Your take on it was the same as mine. Essentially, the way I understood it is, Black Gay men are more likely to be to AIDS victims then other races, because Whites are hesitant to sleep with them, for fear of contracting the disease. It seems the underlying message is that the disease should be more evenly dispersed among other races of gay men. White guilt at it&rsquo;s most twisted.</p>

&ldquo;The racial disparity in HIV observed for more than a decade,&rdquo; Raymond and McFarland conclude in their report, &ldquo;will not disappear until the challenges posed by a legacy of racism toward blacks in the U.S. are addressed </p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s racist to not want to risk your life, by having sexual contact with a group that is highest ranked in HIV? Now is contracting through interracial contact some badge of honor that proves you aren&rsquo;t racist? UNBELIEVABLE!</p>

<p>Yes. I have dated a number of White men and a few Hispanic men. I am a late 30ish exectuive vice president for a public relations firm and my social cirlce is mostly very upscale. I have dated only two Asian Men. I would say that gay Asians tend to stay within their own ethnic circle when it comes to sex. I would never knowingly date a married man of any race. It has also been my experience that married men tend to be more phyiscally violent. I was beaten twice by two married White men during my relationship with them. </p>
<p>Whenever the White men and the few Black men who approached me for sex told me they were married, I would quickly tell them &#8220;I am not interested.&#8221; Regretfully, I ended up sleeping and having sex with men I did not know were married given the fact that they lied to me.</p>

		<p>During the early years, when AIDS was first thrust into the spotlight, gay blacks -especially in San Francisco-started spreading the notion that if black gays didn&rsquo;t sleep with white gays, then they wouldn&rsquo;t get AIDS. This attitude so shocked a black pastor in San Francisco, that he started an &#8216;AIDS awareness workshop&#8221; in the SF black neighborhoods to counter that kind of thinking.  </p>
