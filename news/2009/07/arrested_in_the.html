			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ryan Kisiel, Daily Mail (London), July 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It looked like it was supposed to be the happiest day of their lives.</p>
<p>But instead of walking down the aisle with bouquets of flowers in their hands, two brides and their grooms were handcuffed and taken to a police station.</p>
<p>The arrests were part of a co-ordinated operation investigating an international bogus marriage scam to allow immigrants to stay in the country.</p>
<p>Police and immigration officers raided two homes and arrested the Slovakian brides and Nigerian grooms before they reached the churches yesterday.</p>
<p>Another four men from Nigeria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, who are believed to be making up to £15,000 for each sham wedding, were also arrested. A further six Nigerian men were also detained on suspected immigration offences.</p>
<p>The arrests were centred around two gangs in Manchester and Bradford, West Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Officers waited until the Nigerian gang drove from Manchester to Bradford before arresting them in a service station just hours before the two weddings were due to take place.</p>
<p>Detective Sergeant Peter Gallagher, who led the operation, said: &#8216;We believe we have cracked an organised conspiracy in which marriage fixers and European brides were making money from Nigerian grooms desperate to find a way to stay in the UK.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A suspect is taken into custody during the UK Borders Agency raids into sham marriages taking place at an M62 service station in West Yorkshire</p>
<p>Four men believed to be making up to £15,000 from each sham wedding were also arrested</p>
<p>The churches believed to have been targeted by the gangs are St Philip &amp; St James in Scholes, South Yorkshire, and St Lukes in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire.</p>
<p>UK Border Agency regional director Jeremy Oppenheim said: &#8216;We will not tolerate immigration abuse and will punish those who break the immigration laws.</p>
<p>&#8216;Over recent years we have clamped down on sham marriages introducing Certificates of Approval, family permits and encouraged registrars to highlight suspicious cases.</p>
<p>&#8216;That&rsquo;s why suspected sham marriages fell from over 3,500 in 2004 to under 400 in 2008. Under the tougher rules, anyone trying to play the system can expect to face imprisonment for up to seven years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It follows a vicar being charged with conspiracy to aid unlawful entry to the UK by helping to organise more than 180 &#8216;sham&rsquo; weddings for illegal immigrants earlier this month.</p>
<p>Reverend Alex Brown, 60, was arrested in a dawn raid on his rectory home in St Leonards, East Sussex, and his church, St Peters, 200 yards away.</p>
<p>He is accused of holding a &#8216;conveyor belt&rsquo; of services to allow African and Eastern European immigrants from outside the European Union to marry those with the right to stay in the UK.</p>
<p>When a migrant completes a bogus marriage, they can remain in Britain and move freely in the EU.</p>
<p>Those with residency rights in the UK, often from other EU countries, are paid up to £2,000 a time to take part in the sham weddings.</p>
<p>Labour toughened marriage laws in February 2005 after the number of suspect ceremonies  &mdash;  often arranged by criminal gangs who could earn £10,000 a time  &mdash;  reached 3,700 per year. Migrants were made to get a special certificate to marry if they lived outside the EU, or had only limited rights to live in the UK.</p>
<p>Those with only three months&rsquo; leave to remain were routinely refused on the grounds that the ceremony was performed just to avoid removal from the country.</p>
<p>The number of sham weddings has since fallen to around 300 a year. But the crackdown was left in tatters after the Law Lords ruled it breaches migrants&rsquo; human rights.</p>
<p>Law Lords said forcing a migrant to prove a relationship is genuine is &#8216;arbitrary and unjust&rsquo;, even if they were getting married only weeks before their permission to stay in Britain ran out.<br>

		<p>The good news is that we are allowing your marriage. The bad news for you is that your EU passport is revoked, you&rsquo;ve now been awarded a Nigerian passport and will be deported back to Africa with your new &#8216;husband&rsquo;. Congratulations, we hope that you will be very happy with him in the &#8220;motherland&#8221;, where you will spend what remains of your life.</p>

<p>Perhaps so her children can have more &#8216;athletic&rsquo; genes, or be eligible for racial and social preferences. Maybe just for sex. <br>

<p>___</p>
<p>Money? There were a lot of German women who marry Turks and get a lot of money for that.<br>
After six months or one year, they divorce and guys will be allowed to bring his wife and children.</p>

<p>The Slovakian bride is a EU national confers her EU citizenship on her Nigerian husband.</p>
<p>I married a Japanese in Japan and the Sakai City Hall and the Minami Hanadacho Ward Office had no misgivings on being presented with the correct paperwork. The Immigration Office wanted rather more detailed information, despite the fact I&rsquo;m a white Brit.</p>
<p>Suspect nationalities in Japan: Nigerians [again,] Pakistanis, Iranians, Chinese, Koreans. </p>
<p>The Japanese authorities always suspect that Thai women and Filipinas marrying Japanese are hookers and taking part in a pro-forma sham marriage.</p>

		<p>To all posters replying to my earlier post:</p>
<p>Thanks for your opinions and insights. However, I think a Slovakian woman would be better off marrying a Pole, or even a Roma gypsy, before marrying a Nigerian. Miscegenation aside for the moment, don&rsquo;t they realize that most Nigerians are Muslims who can be brutal, no matter where they are?</p>
<p>I remember an episode of &#8216;NYPD Blue&#8221;, a few seasons back. A Nigerian man was arrested and charged with brutally murdering his wife. When asked by the police why he did it, he said she wasn&rsquo;t behaving like a true wife to him, and wouldn&rsquo;t do as she was told. The police told him he was in New York now, not Nigeria, and that women here had certain rights. It made no difference to the Nigerian.</p>

		<p>I worked the visa line in Jamaica and can&rsquo;t count the number of American women (both white and black) who showed up with some guy in shoulder-length dreadlocks to get a fiance visa.  They had just met on the beach three days before, fallen deeply in love, and wanted to be married.  Oh, couldn&rsquo;t get married in Jamaica, no man, no time, have to go to the U.S. for that.</p>

		<p>&#8220;ONE OF THE HOLLAND SISTERS MARRIED A PAKI FOR FIVE THOUSAND QUID - BLOODY CASH IN HAND AN ALL _ AND GOT A DIVORCE A YEAR LATER&#8221;<br>
- from a conversation in Lancaster, U.K.</p>
<p>Soprano Fan -</p>
<p>It is all too easy to confuse the PASSPORT MARRIAGE with a REAL LOVE/INFATUATION marriage</p>
<p>The first ends in legal divorce ASAP [there was even an American comedy/romantic film made on the subject, but I forget who was in it] </p>
<p>&hellip; But the latter - especially if one partner is totally fooled or infatuated - ends in tears and heartbreak: usually the 3rd world beachboy or restaurant waiter* or gigolo marrying a citizen of a 1st World country [USA / UK / France / Germany / Denmark &hellip;] </p>
<p>But sometimes a gutsy Russki or Ukrainian lady marrying an American/Canadian/Brit male over a certain age and only later does the groom learn that she - his new bride - has 1 or 2 or 3 kids and was married 1 or 2 or 3 times before &hellip;</p>
<p>Considering how marriage is a flying leap anyway [and Kipling rightly observed that we permit people to get married who would not be allowed to buy a polo pony unsupervised] it is astonishing that ANY marriages work out</p>
<p>The TRULY astounding thing to MY mind is how many of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon&rsquo;s Reunification Church marriages work out - the idea [often] is to partner marriage-mates from &#8220;enemy nations&#8221; and thus create universal hamony and happiness - sometimes with totally-unseen-beforehand partners and yet the rate of staying-together marriages compares favorably with most marriages concluded under totally normal circumstances.</p>
