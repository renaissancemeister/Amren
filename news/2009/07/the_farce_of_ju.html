		<p>Xicano Records and Films purpose for creating the &#8220;Farce of July&#8221; according to the article is to, &#8220;use art and music as an instrument of community empowerment, education and celebration while bringing to light the experience of historically oppressed peoples throughout the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well we all want to be enlightened and it&rsquo;s good that no alcohol, drugs, or fireworks will be allowed. The surrounding areas in which I live, that happen to now be populated by those same &#8220;historically oppressed people&#8221;, were not able to enforce those high ideals. No, instead they got drunk, shot off illegal fireworks until 3AM, and scared the hell out of all of the poor dogs and cats in the neigborhood. Most of the clowns involved had no idea what the Fourth of July meant anyway,so,actually THEY were celebrating the REAL Farce of July and they didn&rsquo;t even charge admittance.</p>
<p>So, as many posters on this forum have pointed out in the past, and continue to point out, the effects of the traitorous 1965 immigration act continues to enlighten us with the benefits of multiculturalism.</p>

		<p>Are any of you sick of the phrase &#8220;historically oppressed peoples&#8221; All peoples have been subjected to oppression at one time or the other. Most people of European descent had medieval serfs for ancestors. But alas, the tired old left wing mantra remains alive and well.  </p>

		<p>If these poor people are the objects of such virulent oppression, why haven&rsquo;t they left the US? Why not hold a festival in Mexico City instead?</p>
<p>&#8221; &hellip;feature live performances by LA&rsquo;s own fierce hip hop emcees The (SIS)tem, internationally known Australian-Chicana hip hop mc Maya Jupiter in a special collaboration with hip-hop &amp; soul vocals by Aloe Blacc &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>How many extant warrants must there be among these &#8220;performers&#8221; and their fans? The LAPD could do the city some good here.</p>

<p>The expected laughable nonsense form the &ldquo;oppressed peoples&rdquo; of this country!</p>
<p>They insult our country and race through their crazed babblings and idiotic caterwauls, which they have the effrontery to call &ldquo;art and music,&rdquo; go unmolested while doing so, and still remain &ldquo;victimized&rdquo; in what passes for their minds nonetheless?  The absurdity of this is beyond all reason to me and only proves that these people can never, ever, be considered Americans. No matter what we give them, no matter how amicable we are to their irrationalities, there will never be anything in exchange but more truculent stupidity and arrogant abnormalities from their end.</p>
<p>The proper response to this &ldquo;Farce of July&rdquo; and everything like it (such as illegal invaders marching to demand citizenship,) would be to allow them to concentrate into a maximum crowd level in their celebrations and demonstrations, and then set bombers and helicopter gunships loose upon them!</p>
<p>At the very least, this would teach them that &ldquo;oppressed peoples&rdquo; can have varying degrees of &ldquo;oppression&rdquo;!!!<br>

		<p> This article made my blood boil. <br>
My husband, who immigrated here from Russia LEGALLY, 4 years ago was awestruck when I took him to our 4th of July display.</p>
<p> The city I am from (Pittsburgh) is known the country over for having one of the most fabulous fireworks display around. We had a great vantage point, The Smithfield Street Bridge, which is at direct eye level with The Point at Point State Park where Fort Pitt is located and the field house still stands.</p>
<p> He is proud of his homeland, Russia, proud of the nationalists and proud of the lack of &#8220;diversity&#8221; there but understands the United States and what it stands for and the freedom we all have to fight so hard to keep.</p>
<p> A group of young Russians came up and stood right beside us. Imagine that. Thousands of people there, thousands of places to stand and they come up right beside us. I understand a good bit of Russian so I said to my husband,&#8221;There&rsquo;s some of your countrymen right beside us. Why don&rsquo;t you say hello?&#8221; And he says,&#8221;No, as tonight I am proud American.&#8221; </p>
<p>All I could feel was pride toward my husband, who as an immigrant, is assimilating so well and already his pride at having the priviledge to come to this country and his appreciation of Freedom which we might not have much longer.<br>
Enjoy it now, sweet husband.</p>

		<p>It is sad that some people choose to be so ignorent and intolerant. They do not know the meaning of the word oppressed.<br>
After 30 years of liberal domination of the acadamy, we have a generation of people who do not have enough knowledge to put anything in prospective.</p>

		<p> You would think that, eventually, these &#8220;oppressed&#8221; people would realize they are enjoying the diminishing benefits of American society without even being required to earn it, or to show gratitude.   </p>

		<p>     One Bunker Hill Day, I went to the celebration. There were<br>
about a hundred or so people there. Just before the begining,<br>
two busloads of Black kids and teachers showed up. They never<br>
bothered to walk up the hill, but just stayed on the steet to<br>
buy ice cream. Not only did they not stand up for the anthem, as<br>
far as I could tell, they never paid any attention at all to<br>
anything that was happening. For them, it was just a school out-<br>
ing to get ice cream.</p>

		<p>  &#8220;There&rsquo;s just something about noise and minorities. They go together. They DO love noise!&#8221;</p>
<p>I worked in Harlem for a couple of years, some time ago, and of course it was always noisy. But each summer, and especially around 4th of July, it degenerated into an absolute HELL of noise. I feel pity for the enderly and the sick who have to live there and put up with all of that. It would drive anyone mad   &mdash;   firecrackers going off all night long outside their windows.  I have heard pitiful complaints from residents there who were simply desperate for a little peace and to be able to get some sleep.  As usual, black people are their own worst enemies. No wonder blacks don&rsquo;t want to live near blacks!  I wouldn&rsquo;t either.  </p>
<p>As usual, it&rsquo;s their their wild, out-of-control &#8220;youths&#8221; who torture everyone else.   Of course, firecrackers are  illegal in NY, and the police try to confiscate them and do what they can, but the situation is simply beyond control. </p>
<p>And then there are the open fire hydrants flooding the streets and lowering water pressure (or eliminating water flow completely)   &mdash;   especially dangerous at a time of many fires when the firemen can&rsquo;t get water. But that&rsquo;s another story. Summer in the city!</p>
<p>For Harlem&rsquo;s uncontrollable and irresponsible young, nearly all of them children of teenage mothers, Fourth of July means nothing to them except an opportunity to make noise and raise hell. And for the rest, it&rsquo;s an occasion to suffer.<br>

		<p>The Fourth of July as a national holiday is just about dead.  Even on my block which is 95% White, all the kids blew off fireworks in front of their homes as did some of the &#8220;young at heart&#8221; adults - and seemed to enjoy the mayhem of non-cgi reality fire that they set off with a match.  Yet with all this rabit pyromania visible in all directions for as far as the eye could see, my home was the only one with an American flag displayed.  While they all shot off their expensive fireworks packages and kept the fire departments on standby, my only act on this holiday was to display the flag and turn my flood light on it while everyone else played with fire.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think one of them thought of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution or the Bill of Rights while they were doing it. No wonder this country is being crashed by every thug and opportunist in the world.</p>

		<p>It should be a matter of course, that the Declaration of Independence is Read Aloud, on every July 4th, in Every Public Square and Forum, so people get a better understanding of what that day is supposed to be about.</p>
<p>It would be like going to Church, Christmas morning, before exchanging, and opening your gifts with your family.</p>
<p>A Reverence for the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution needs to be rekindled in Our People, and what it really means to be American. The Foreigners, and Illegals be damned.</p>
