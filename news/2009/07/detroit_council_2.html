<h1>Detroit Council Takes Aim at Billy Dee Williams Malt Liquor Ads</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Josar, Detroit News, July 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Put off by a recent spate of billboards around the city that feature actor Billy Dee Williams touting malt liquor with the phrase &#8220;works every time,&#8221; the City Council on Tuesday began looking at ways to regulate billboard advertising.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reynolds [Mayowa Lisa Reynolds, a local minister] said she conducted a survey and found the billboards, which feature a cartoon representation of Williams trying to sell Colt 45, located in every square mile of the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She added that she did not find the billboards in nearby communities such as Royal Oak and Plymouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s an issue of racism and perversity,&#8221; Watson said.</p>
<p>Council directed its Research and Analysis Division to see what action council could take and whether council could halt the erection of new billboards.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Council President Kenneth Cockrel Jr. said he too had problems with the billboards but tempered his criticism by suggesting that the ads wouldn&rsquo;t go up if people didn&rsquo;t buy the products.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have to check ourselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see a lot of people buying 40 ounces.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Maybe people in Royal Oak and Plymouth don&rsquo;t buy 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor.</p>
<p>Taking down these billboards would have a disparate impact on a black man&rsquo;s (Billy Dee Williams) income; that is not a factor that the Detroit Cith Council has considered.</p>

		<p>This is the perfect illustration of the diabolical brilliance of the whole &#8220;racism&#8221; flim-flam in the western world. If you don&rsquo;t give Blacks enough attention&hellip;it is racism. If you pay too much attention&hellip;it is racism. If you advertise according to their cultural quirks, it may be a success&hellip;or it may be racism. If you market directly to Blacks it&rsquo;s fine if you are Black, but if not&hellip;it is racism. Etc&hellip;</p>
<p>In other words, you just can&rsquo;t win with Blacks and that is the sad and unavoidable truth.  </p>

		<p>There is no picture of the billboard? I hate it when the news leaves out the images that are deemed offensive. They might as well come out and say it: &#8220;This is offensive. TRUST US.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Anonymous, there is a picture; it´s harmless enough.<br>
As few Whites would buy beer from Billy Dee Williams, there is little point in &#8220;equal showering&#8221; white hoods. After all, the boards cost money.<br>
&#8220;It´s an issue of racism and perversity&#8221;.<br>
&#8220;Denounce the 40 ounce&#8221;.<br>
These Carrie Nations are making me retch.<br>
I can see it now:<br>
&#8220;Surgeon General´s warning: Consumption of this product may be hazardous to your virginity&#8221; printed large over half the foty, with an accompanying comic strip for the literally-challenged.<br>
(On which, they´d scream again because their precious little ones are exposed to obscene etc. Rinse, repeat.)</p>

		<p>So 40 years ago, I am positive that blacks were screaming about the lack of brothers in ads. Just close your eyes and try to picture the pandemonium of blacks gathered to decry Whites being used to advertize products in their cummurnity (community). Fast forward a few decades, black man on billboards in Detroit, a black mayor, and a black President, and there is STILL a problem with the composition of the billboards. </p>
<p>Does anyone get the sense that black Americans have no idea what to get upset about?</p>

		<p>Question Diversity:</p>
<p>I concur absolutely. In KC&rsquo;s ghetto, I&rsquo;ve seen billboards advertising not only malt liquor, but TIPS hotline posters, admonitions to convicted felons to not have firearms, apparently, it&rsquo;s a federal crime and is punishable up to five years in jail, I believe the slogan is, &#8220;one will get you a nickel.&#8221;  That love thy neighbor thing, I meant that!  God.,<br>
Who&rsquo;s the daddy? Call 1-800- something. Should I get tested for AIDS? My boyfriend just got out of jail.  It&rsquo;s not black to smoke crack. Another one was vote for Ron Freeman, even if you never voted Republican in your life.  Freeman was the black Republican nominee for Congress and he lost to a white Democrat named Karen McCarthy in 1994. Apparently race isn&rsquo;t relevant anymore when it comes to who is the most socialist. <br>
Getting back to your original point about Royal Oak and Plymouth, one doesn&rsquo;t see those kinds of billboards in Raymore.<br>

<p>Running down your billboards one by one:</p>
<p>(1) The &#8220;felons don&rsquo;t own guns&#8221; billboards and side-of-the-bus placards said that if you &#8220;committed a gun crime,&#8221; they would send you to the Federal prison in Yankton, South Dakota, where the mosquitoes are big and hungry.  The city in officials in Yankton got really offended when they found out about it; the Federal institution there is climate controlled. </p>
<p>(2) St. Louis City doesn&rsquo;t allow the sale of 40-ounce glass bottles of alcohol, because of all the broken glass on the streets.  </p>
<p>(3) I&rsquo;ve seen the &#8220;Should I get tested for AIDS?  My b/f just got out of the penitentary.&#8221;   St. Louis did KC one better   &mdash;   In 2001, they had a billboard out along I-70 north of downtown for a about a week.  It showed two suggestively naked black men &#8220;embracing&#8221; each other, and said &#8220;Brothers Loving Brothers Safely   &mdash;   Use Condoms.&#8221;  The billboard was too offensive for some, so they painted over it.  What it meant, though, at least for my thinking, is that it dissuaded me of the delusion that I previously had that black homosexuality outside of a prison environment was rare.</p>
<p>(4) I remember Ron Freeman; he was halfway reasonable.  The 1994 mid-term elections were the first cycle that I did thinks like pound the pavement, pass out literature, help out on campaigns, and so on.  Thought I was just a few months too young to be able to vote then.  I was on the Ross Perot organization mailing list, and they endorsed Freeman in MO-5 because he was against free trade.</p>
<p>The common ones around St. Louis are:</p>
<p>(1) Advertising the numerous fly-by-night &#8220;colleges&#8221; in the area; you know how that goes, six weeks of training and you can be a &#8220;medical assistant,&#8221; and wear a scrub suit to work, even though you&rsquo;re nowhere near patient are areas.  And also Harris-Stowe State &#8220;University,&#8221; which is almost as difficult as a suburban high school.  </p>
<p>(2) Nelly, endorsing just about anything and everything.</p>
<p>(3) Start Snitching</p>
<p>(4) Menthol cigarettes, bonus points if you can work a scantily-clad light-skinned black woman into the poster.</p>
<p>(5) Since they happen relatively often, you can see billboards in the ghetto for the gun buyback program de jure, and the radio stations that are the sponsors.  Funny, they always seem to be black radio stations.  I never see the classical radio music station in town, owned by the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, the soft rock station, or the country music stations as sponsors.  Though I would rather be a prostitute and let out a large rip of flatulence in a church than advertise a gun buyback program on a country music radio station.</p>
<p>(6)  This one was common until several years ago   &mdash;   the St. Louis City Health Department must have taken a full-length picture of a naked young black man, then crop the picture as far down as you can get without showing any &#8220;hair.&#8221;  Superimposed on the image was:  &#8220;Who was he doing before he was doing you?  Get tested for STDs.&#8221;</p>
<p>(7)  Billboards for all those &#8220;gentlemen&rsquo;s clubs&#8221; on the East Side.  IIRC, the ones in Kansas City are all in the West Bottoms, where just about everything crummy is.  Now I know why KC built the Sprint Center uphill and downtown to replace Kemper Arena, which is in the west bottoms.</p>

		<p>The city of Indianapolis consists of 9 townships that are laid out like a tic-tac-toe board. While on the surface, it is still a nice looking city, it seems to be in a race to become more like Detroit every day. Outside of the private schools, hardly any of the 11 school districts are functioning at some competent level. </p>
<p>There are ads of this ilk on the West Side and the near East side. A lot of areas around the city are basket cases, some some tend to garner more attention than others. It was a school on the East Side (which looks a lot like Gary, Indiana in some places) that garnered national attention when two sixth graders had sex in a classroom.  </p>
<p>A few years back, my wife and I were looking to buy our first home. One of the places we looked at was in Wayne Township (West side past I-465). We came across a bus stop advertisement. It offered DNA testing and the number was something along the lines of 1-800-RU-DADDY. On the basis of this alone, we decided not to buy there. If there is this much illegitimacy, how much of a mess will the neighborhood be in 15 years. We no longer live in the city limits. It&rsquo;s not safe. </p>

		<p>Whites don&rsquo;t buy and drink Colt .45 Malt Liquor. So, who would naturally advertise it to the people that do? </p>
<p>If Colt .45 didn&rsquo;t advertise to Blacks,they would go out of Business. </p>
