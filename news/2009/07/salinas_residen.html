<h1>Salinas Residents Say They Are Tired of Waiting for Immigration Reform</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maria Ines Zamudio, Salinas Californian (Salinas, California), July 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After getting off work, Rojas got ready and went to church not to pray but to organize with others and demand comprehensive immigration reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are tired of waiting,&#8221; the farmworker said in Spanish. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a citizen now and [politicians] need my vote. We have to mobilize by any means.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rojas said she has family members who have been separated because of what she calls &#8220;a broken immigration system.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was one of the hundreds of farmworkers and community members from Salinas and around Monterey County who gathered at St. Mary of the Nativity church in east Salinas to ask U.S. Rep. Sam Farr, D-Carmel, to push for immigration reform in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>She was one of the hundreds of farmworkers and community members from Salinas and around Monterey County who gathered at St. Mary of the Nativity church in east Salinas to ask U.S. Rep. Sam Farr, D-Carmel, to push for immigration reform in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart is with the people who better this county with their labor,&#8221; Farr told the audience in Spanish. &#8220;I need an army of people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We are changing this country to fulfill the dreams for everyone and not just a small group. I&rsquo;ll be your voice in Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s community meeting in Salinas followed action by the Obama administration which launched investigations of hundreds of businesses around the country as part of its strategy to focus immigration enforcement on employers who hire illegal workers.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree that our immigration system is broken. We need to start enforcing our immigration laws, then all of the families that are seperated would no longer be seperated and be together back in Mexico where they belong.</p>

<p>If you really are a citizen, then you&rsquo;ve nothing to worry about.  Then again, in California, where most of the voter registration boards are run by Hispanics, white leftists and sundry libs, illegals can and do register to vote, and actually vote.</p>
<p>Salinas is probably a sanctuary city, and CA is practically a sanctuary state.  They have nothing to worry about if they never leave CA, or at least stay out of a few conservative parts.  But they don&rsquo;t want to stay in California, they want to move to states that will actually have welfare, for some odd reason, CA can&rsquo;t afford its welfare state anymore.</p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t you go home and better your own country with your labor.  It needs it far more than this one.</p>
<p>If mexes like her had expended as much energy and time on her own government, she wouldn&rsquo;t have to come up here and screw up our country.</p>
<p>If there is one thing this country DOES NOT need it&rsquo;s more laborers.  WE ARE IN A DEEP RECESSION/DEPRESSION.  What part of that does she fail to understand?</p>

<p>This (going after just &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of employers of IAs  &mdash;  if in fact such a campaign in earnest has been initiated) ) just amounts to one of the many tax collection/corporate shakedown schemes that the present administration is promoting. Once all of the corporate non-Obama campaign donor low hanging juicy fruit has been picked, look for this campaign to be shut down.   </p>

		<p>  Someone with legal standing in the city should find a white civil rights lawyer or a black civil rights lawyer who is sick of the farce and ask them to bring a case for aiding and abetting, providing assistance to illegal aliens after they are in the USA as the laws provide for and a case can probably be made for bring charges of violating the civil rights of US citizens by assisting and encouraging illegal aliens and others to demand a curtailment of the civil rights of Americans to jobs and infringe upon the rights of US citizens by demanding legalization for their illegal presence and taking of jobs and usually the falsification of documents. Rojas&rsquo; citizenship can be revoked for a felony and for assisting or conspiring to assist others to violate the civil rights of US citizens according to a friend who is a civil rights lawyer (and who is swamped with work defending Americans).</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curious as to who she thinks separated their family. Weren&rsquo;t they all together before some of them abandoned the rest by relocating?</p>

		<p>I wonder if &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; would put a stop the Salinas&rsquo; gang problem. Or, would it exacerbate it?  Nearly every other story in the Salinas Californian newspaper recounts some form of gang violence.  Much of the gang violence breaks down by immigration rank&hellip;it&rsquo;s basically old &#8220;established&#8221; immigrants (Nortenos) vs new immigrants (Surenos).  Ms Rojas, you tell us how you&rsquo;re going to stop the immigrants for shooting each other, and we&rsquo;ll let you know how many more you can bring over.</p>

		<p>I hope the form of immigration reform is in the form of enforcement of our existing immigration laws.</p>
