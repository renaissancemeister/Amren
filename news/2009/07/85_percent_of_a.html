<h1><a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=986798&amp;lang=eng_news">85 Percent of Australians Say Racism a Problem: Survey</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Agence France-Presse, June 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some 85 percent of Australians believe the country has a problem with racism, new research has shown following renewed ethnic tensions in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The study, led by University of Sydney social science professor Kevin Dunn, found one-in-five had experienced racial abuse while one-in-10 had been excluded from activities on the basis of race.</p>
<p>The Challenging Racism Project, collating surveys and studies over the past 11 years, provides a timely snapshot of Australian race relations, which are again under a cloud after a series of attacks on Indian students.</p>
<p>Racial prejudice was identified as a problem by 85 percent of respondents, yet 87 percent believed cultural diversity was positive for Australia.</p>
<p>Dunn said the apparent contradiction reflected Australians&rsquo; mixed feelings towards multiculturalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Australians (are) pro-cultural diversity, yet anxious of the dangers inherent to cultural diversity if it is not well managed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>About 12 percent of respondents identified themselves as racist, compared to about a third in a similar study in the European Union carried out in 2004.</p>
<p>Dunn said he conceived the project in 1996, when right-wing politician Pauline Hanson was enjoying a surge of popularity with her attacks on Asian immigration and Aboriginal welfare.</p>
<p>Since then, Australia&rsquo;s major racial flashpoint was the Cronulla riots in December 2005, when mobs of whites attacked Lebanese Australians at a southern Sydney beach, sparking a series of retaliations.</p>
<p>Most recently, Indian students have been subject to violent attacks in Australia&rsquo;s major cities, causing outrage on the subcontinent and diplomatic tensions with New Delhi.</p>
<p>Dunn criticized politicians for denying there was any racial element to the Indian attacks, saying their stance hindered efforts to address the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly there is a need for the realities of racism to be acknowledged, this is essential for enabling public policy responses to racism,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Muslims were the minority most often cited as a concern by Australians, followed by Aborigines, Asians, black Africans and Jews.</p>
<p>Almost one-in-four victims of racism said they were &#8220;more bitter and cynical&#8221; as a result of their experience.<br>

		<p>We are a racist society. Try getting a job at with the National parks if you&rsquo;re white. Imagine a white-only health service. How easy would it be to graduate from university if it was free and you got a 15% credit on course marking (you wouldn&rsquo;t have to pass to pass). A 15% criminal sentencing discount for being &#8220;marginalised by society&#8221;? It&rsquo;s hard being white, but would you want to be anything else.</p>

		<p>That was amusing. No &#8216;racism&rsquo; involved in the attacks on Indians? Since the main attackers were Muslim Lebanese in Sydney and African gangs in Melbourne, I guess that doesn&rsquo;t involve &#8216;racism&rsquo; because only white Aussies could possibly be &#8216;racist&rsquo;, right? As for &#8216;mixed feelings towards multiculturalism&rsquo; - yes, we do have mixed feelings. The Europeans who migrated after WWII have integrated into Australian society, often marrying Australians and naming their sons &#8216;Kevin&rsquo; (as have many Asians) - it&rsquo;s the latest arrivals who worry us. There are too many Asians, too many Indians, too many trouble-making Muslims. I have plenty of Asian friends, but this is Australia, not an an Asian country, not a Muslim country. Everyone I know is sick to death of the whole situation and our old easy-going ways are disappearing. Everyone is aware of the situation in the UK and Europe, invaded by hordes of aliens, and we don&rsquo;t wish to end up the same, with sharia courts and enshrouded women. If that&rsquo;s &#8216;racist&rsquo; then I plead guilty, Your Honour.</p>

		<p>Yeah, funny how they skipped the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t whites attacking Indians. Kind of how &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; is always unstated (or stated) as white, when whites are much more likely to be victims of such crimes instead. There&rsquo;s some racism. But it&rsquo;s Ok, even quite encouraged to be racist against whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny how there&rsquo;s always a survey just waiting to be made public after some incident or the other. Almost like someone&rsquo;s anticipating an incident OR the survey&rsquo;s are fictitious.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a multi-racial society there are a considerable number of people at university (and companies now too) who get paid to examine racism, discover it, and to promote the agenda of multiculturalism, and non-whites specifically. The irony being they never, ever notice racism against whites, even if it is the universities (or governments or companies) official policy in writing. Mostly they don&rsquo;t acknowledge the reality of white existence at all, outside of their role as officially designated oppressors. </p>
<p>&#8220;Australians (are) pro-cultural diversity, yet anxious of the dangers inherent to cultural diversity if it is not well managed&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a good line. Generally the multiculturalists are either very vague, or they contradict themselves in an unflattering way. I have noticed, though, in the rare instance when &#8216;multiculturalists&rsquo; or the establishment are exposed to a Jared Taylor type of resistance, it simply makes them better racists. They&rsquo;re forced to raise their game so to speak. Sometimes almost to the point of being honest. Fortunately, or unfortunately, most of them have never seriously heard a dissenting argument before. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Australians (are)&hellip; anxious of the dangers inherent to cultural diversity if it is not well managed,&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no way to &#8216;manage&rsquo; nature&rsquo;s inherent deadly competitivemness (except on the farm, where the farmer keeps all plants equal by hatchet, ax, and saw).  That&rsquo;s dictatorship. </p>
<p>Tito kept the diverse cultures of Yugoslavia under one roof for 50 years, but when the dictator&rsquo;s &#8216;management&rsquo; ended, nature&rsquo;s competition between ethnic cultures went from bloodless competition to overt war.</p>
<p><br>
When you introduce diversity, you introduce nature&rsquo;s inter-ethnic competition.  There can be no &#8216;management&rsquo; of ethnic diversity which doesn&rsquo;t leave one or more cultures aggrieved. Australians are thinking very un-Australian if they choose diversity.  They will not enjoy their freedoms being managed by a dictatorial central government, which, regardless, will fail at the task.</p>

<p>There were similar results here in the USA where people polled stated that multiculturalism is a good thing but than expressed concern about how it would be managed. In other words, people don&rsquo;t really like or want multiculturalism, otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t be concerned, but feel they must say it&rsquo;s good thing because it&rsquo;s now the &#8220;right&#8221; thing to say.<br>

<p>the last part of the sentence states &#8220;if it&rsquo;s not well managed&#8221;   are you kidding?  So who&rsquo;s going to manage it?  A totalitarian government?  </p>

		<p>Interesting  &mdash;  87% percent of the respondents said that diversity was positive, while 12% identified themselves as racist.  Presumably, there isn&rsquo;t much overlap between the two groups.  So, presumably, only 1% of the self-identified non-racists don&rsquo;t feel that diversity is positive?  </p>

<p>This is classic liberal hubris, which is ironically quite racist. Diversity is very hard to manage, most countries that have tried it have failed miserably, but the modern white managerial class is so good that they can do it where other races or previous white societies have failed.</p>
<p>In their own inflated minds, toaday&rsquo;s liberal White elites are like disembodied saints floating far above the grubby white and brown masses with their shallow cynicism and base material and biological concerns.</p>

<p>So they recognize that &lsquo;cultural diversity&rsquo; poses a danger to their society. What exactly do Australians benefit from this &lsquo;cultural diversity?&rsquo; </p>
<p>Being marginalized and displaced in their own country? Increased crime rates? Identity politics? Racial quotas? Race-based programs? Race riots? Endless racial conflict and tension?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out that diversity = the death of Western civilization. </p>
