			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Geoff Chambers, Gold Coast Bulletin (Molendinar, Queensland), July 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>PACIFIC Islander and Maori youths are forming gangs in schools and have been identified by the Gold Coast City Council as an emerging social problem.</p>
<p>Large populations of New Zealanders and Polynesians have migrated to the northern end of the Gold Coast, forcing a re-think of the city&rsquo;s social inclusion program.</p>
<p>Tweed Heads resident Jack Berryman, a Maori heavily involved with local Waitangi Day celebrations, told The Weekend Bulletin many of the youths had been caught up in gang culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is the Maori and Polynesian culture, where the kids band together and sometimes get up to no good when boredom kicks in,&#8221; said Mr Berryman.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the warrior instinct. They like to play tough and fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bulletin has been told of social problems at Nerang and Keebra Park state high schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the kids are sent over, whether it be because they&rsquo;ve been playing up or have been forced to come because their parents have work here, they can sometimes get defensive,&#8221; said Mr Berryman.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is also that gang persona, driven by the American persona of the Bloods and Crips and the New Zealand gang culture driven by Black Power and the Mongrel Mob.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Federal Government and the council are expected to join forces to ensure the Gold Coast and Tweed region avoids the Sydney western suburbs example, which is rife with ethnic violence.</p>
<p>Mayor Ron Clarke this week met Immigration and Citizenship Minister Senator Chris Evans at the Beenleigh Community Cabinet meeting to discuss the influx of Polynesians.</p>
<p>The city is expected to apply for funding to bankroll social inclusion programs and the parliamentary secretary for multicultural affairs Laurie Ferguson is expected to meet with the council.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really want to nip this in the bud,&#8221; said Cr Clarke.</p>
<p>&#8220;As it currently stands, the city&rsquo;s high housing costs have meant that we have not experienced the same influx as other areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we want to stop gangs gathering in particular areas of the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nerang councillor and sustainable city future chair Peter Young said he was aware of tensions in some local schools.</p>
<p>Cr Young said he would work closely with local Pacific Islander community groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a whole list of reasons why we&rsquo;re seeing this trend occurring,&#8221; said Cr Young.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the main focus should be on support services.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can get some extra government funding, we will be able to set up programs to assist kids who might be a bit lost or finding it hard to establish an identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cr Young said the church community would be consulted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the church communities are dominated by Kiwis and Pacific Islanders,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the focus has to be on educating the youth, particularly the young boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>The council will discuss funding options after the winter recess break.</p>

		<p>It all stems back to &#8216;Coming of Age in Samoa&rsquo; and anthropologists like Margaret Mead and the whole field of anthropology: Natives are pure. They are beautific, innocent beings naturally free from sin. Morally, at the very least, they are far more advanced than we are. Therefore, they don&rsquo;t need oppressive social conditioning. Whites are not similarly blessed with freedom from sin. Not at all. </p>

		<p>Pacific Islanders are an entirely different race than Europeans.  They evolved under dramatically different environmental and social conditions and, as a result, are genetically predisposed to behave in an entirely different way.  Such differences among the various races make it extremely difficult for them to live side-by-side.  Forcing different races to live together usually causes tension, followed by outright conflict, and sometimes even genocide of the weaker race.</p>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if weaker is always the issue, perhaps more civilized is?  At least the way the issues are shaping up, it appears that it is Whites having civilized themselves and having set out to civilize the world some time ago, have failed as Kipling noted they always would - and are now being eclipsed because Whites refuse to redefine themselves are beings with an inherent right to survive.</p>

		<p>During the blueberry picking season in NZ,whole families of immigrant Pacific Islanders originally from Tonga and Samoa come out from the city to pick the crops.The manager has to allocate them separate parts of the fields to work,because they will fight each other.The richness of cultural diversity hasn&rsquo;t really caught on.</p>

<p>&#8220;they can sometimes get defensive.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Whites are such suckers for suicidal immigration policies maintained by sell-out lying politicians. The truth has always been that when you let in people of different 3ird world tribal cultures and you get kicked in the teeth for thanks. Whites evidently would leave their children to be impaled on tribal spears rather than think of themselves as &#8220;racists&#8221;. Whites seem to be mostly suicidally softhearted fools, probably a genetic trait that delights the tribal 3ird world peoples who aren&rsquo;t nearly so foolish. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re totally right.  It&rsquo;s the same here; all the black gang bangers &#8220;got caught up&#8221; in gangs and &#8220;fell into the wrong crowd.&#8221;  If they call just &#8220;got caught up&#8221; and &#8220;fell into the wrong crowd,&#8221; then who is doing the &#8220;lassoing&#8221; and who is the &#8220;wrong crowd?&#8221; Nobody, I suppose.  Or the better explanation is that they are the wrong crowd.</p>

<p>OK, so it&rsquo;s the Maori and Polynesian culture that causes kids to be violent brutes when &#8220;boredom kicks in? &#8220;<br>
Are you seroius? Learn to speak English properly and try reading a book if you&rsquo;re bored&hellip;excuses, excuses&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is also that gang persona, driven by the American persona of the Bloods and Crips and the New Zealand gang culture driven by Black Power and the Mongrel Mob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great&hellip;admitted by one of their leaders none the less.<br>
More are coming to Australia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with a few Maoris/Kiwis and I can say that whilst they were wary of me because I&rsquo;m a White Australian (I was from outer space as far as they were concerned and vice-versa), they were alright when you worked with them. Hard workers too the blokes I knew, but there&rsquo;s always the chip on shoulder&hellip;<br>
