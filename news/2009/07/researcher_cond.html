<p>The strength of this urge to conform can silence even those who have good reason to think the majority is wrong. {snip} Then you&rsquo;ll bear the less comfortable label of &#8220;maverick,&#8221; which is only a few stops short of &#8220;scapegoat&#8221; or &#8220;pariah.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Though they sprout up in every country, they [academic monocultures] may be a particular problem in Confucian-influenced cultures that prize conformity and respect for elders. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;We still have whole domains we can&rsquo;t talk about,&#8221; Dr. Bouchard said, referring to the psychology of differences between races and sexes.<br>

		<p>Were you a non tenured geography professor at university and attempted to start a debate from the position that global warming has no anthropomorphic component your career would end.  Much like religion, climate change has its own orthodoxy and woe to he who deviates from the high priest&rsquo;s version of truth. <br>
The same can be said of any debate involving race. If you are not lock stock and bagel behind all of the sacraments of liberal diversity you are ipso facto a racist and will soon be looking for employment elsewhere.<br>

		<p>Academics think they are the most advanced, liberal minds in the history of civilization. They are, in fact, the closest thing to medieval monks we have in the modern world. We could even refer to them as race mullahs.</p>

		<p>Footnote: Nicholas Wade, the author of the report above and long-time New York Times science reporter, is also author of a wonderfully written, richly insightful book on the explosion of insights on our remote history afforded by our ability to sequence the human genome.</p>
<p>Here is two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning biologist E. O. Wilson, describing that book, Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors (2006):</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;Before the Dawn is by far the best book I have ever read on humanity&rsquo;s deep history. With courage and balance, [Nicholas] Wade has pulled together the explosion of discoveries now ongoing in diverse fields of biology and the social sciences on the origin of our species, and he explains a large part of what is necessary to comprehend the human condition.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Most academics have extreme difficulty living outside their university womb where the real world lives and works everyday.</p>
<p>In the last 20 years a new image of them is emerging of some nerdy type who would be great sitting in a closet with one light bulb overhead editing the fine print on contracts, but is far too naive to understand what the real world is all about.</p>
<p>But, of course, we can&rsquo;t ignore a fairly large portion of them who are brainwashed ideologogues who couldn&rsquo;t think objectively if their lives depended on it.  These are the close minded ones who are so fanatical they feel compelled to inform everyone of their distorted views with the intent of corrupting other minds down to their level.  </p>

		<p>Turlough&rsquo;s comment (#1) resonates with truth: if you are not lock stock and bagel behind all of the sacraments of liberal diversity you are ipso facto a racist and will soon be looking for employment elsewhere.&#8221; Even though non-racial issues demand conformity among these intellectuals, e.g., climate change, somehow these hateful people always manage to insert racism so called into any assertion they make about the inferiority of their empirical or conservative grounded opponents. The need to denigrate oneself if one is white, is disturbing. At least when blacks raise racism as a weapons agaisnt someone who does not immediately accede to their demands, it is a practical tool to acquire money and better jobs that they otherwise would never qualify for. But whites? With masters and doctorates?</p>

		<p>3 Anon: I went and got that book, &#8220;Before the Dawn&#8221;, and read the chapter on race.  Mr Wade doesn&rsquo;t take our side, but he discredits our opponents.  He even mentions IQ differences.  I expect he knows the score and, given his position with the NY Times, he&rsquo;s doing his best.</p>

<p>Ah, but haven&rsquo;t you fallen for Global Warming also? Aren&rsquo;t even you, someone who apparently doesn&rsquo;t believe in Global Warming, also spreading the myth in part? Global Warming is a scary prospect, as would be Global cooling, but Where&rsquo;s the proof the Earth has actually warmed? From 1940 to 1979, the Earth had been cooling. Is the current &#8216;Global Warming&rsquo; simply the Earth returning to it&rsquo;s previous averages? Also, how hard would it be, to simply report on Global temperatures where the Earth has warmed while disregarding sites where the Earth has cooled? Frankly, I don&rsquo;t believe the science they are reporting to us as &#8216;fact&rsquo;. In my experience, where I&rsquo;ve lived, it&rsquo;s gotten noticeably cooler from around 1999 to 2009. So much colder that frankly I wonder if &#8216;climate change&rsquo; has been North America getting cooler while somewhere else apparently is getting warming. This isn&rsquo;t science but I trust it more than I do the news releases. Aren&rsquo;t these same news releases also concerned about racial hate-crime while the overwhelming evidence and reality is that most racial crime and violence is committed by non-whites?.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Mr Wade doesn&rsquo;t take our side, but he discredits our opponents. He even mentions IQ differences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just because your opponents are wrong (and the politically correct crowd {backed up by a frightening amount moral authority} are so obviously wrong that it would border on humor), but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you are right. That&rsquo;s generally my view, as a &#8216;race realist&rsquo;. The anti-white racists in power are wrong, but the anti-color racists are often just as wrong too. That&rsquo;s my opinion anyway.  </p>
