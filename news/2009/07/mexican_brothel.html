			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk (Virginia) Examiner, July 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Illegal alien and convicted felon Emma Tlacoxolal-Perez was sentenced this week in U.S. District Court to 33 months in prison for running brothels in Chesapeake, Newport News, James City County and Williamsburg.</p>
<p>The Mexican national was the head of a prostitution ring which employed women smuggled into this country from Mexico, and only catered to other illegal aliens. Tlaccoxablal-Perez, along with co-conspirator Felipe Vargas-Ortega, passed out business cards to advertise for the brothel known as El Nopal (The Prickly Pear).</p>
<p>Two more alleged co-conspirators, Francisco Sanchez-Martinez and Juan Carlos Vargas-Ortega, are scheduled for trial in September.</p>
<p>Tlacoxolal-Perez, 37, who has operated brothels in the Hampton Roads area since 2004, was actually deported in 2006, but easily found her way back across the largely unprotected border.</p>
<p>Customers paid $30 for 15 minutes with one of the prostitutes, the ring leaders kept half of it.</p>
<p>The Newport News location was in a suburban neighborhood and Mexican men typically went through the neighborhood at all hours, knocking on folks&rsquo; doors looking for the brothel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All of those involved are illegal aliens from Mexico, El Salvador, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Though it may be surprising to some that houses of prostitution catering exclusively to illegal aliens have set up shop in this country&rsquo;s neighborhoods, the problem has become widespread. {snip}</p>
<p>-In February 2009, local police and federal agents raided a brothel run by Mexican nationals in Glen Burnie, MD</p>
<p>-In September 2008, police in Baltimore, MD shut down a Mexican brothel and arrested Carlos Silot, who ran the operation, along with two prostitutes, all were illegal aliens. {snip}</p>
<p>-In June 2007, police in San Antonio arrested a mother and her two daughters for smuggling two minors out of Mexico to use them as prostitutes. Once in the U.S., the girls ages 15 and 17, were told they would have to work as prostitutes for five years to pay off their smuggling fees of $3,000. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>-In January 2006, police in Charlotte, NC raided two brothels run by Mexican nationals, both were crowded with women smuggled into this country and held against their will.</p>
<p>The Charlotte Observer reported that the leaders of these prostitution rings bring Mexican and Central American women in and out of Charlotte, exchanging them for women in Raleigh and Greensboro. One of these women could typically be sold between the pimps for $130 each.</p>
<p>Just as illegal aliens have spread throughout the United States, an epidemic of human trafficking to supply the brothels which cater to them has spread to every corner of this nation.</p>
<p>Most of these women are confined in locked rooms with nothing but the clothes on their backs, and are often beaten. Of course, the women who are kept in these prostitution rings are illegal aliens as well, and are afraid to report what is being done to them. They are told that if they leave, their families back home will be murdered.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Apparently, many illegal aliens are also doing the jobs that American women won&rsquo;t do as well.<br>

		<p>In Queens New York where I live the borough is the fastest demographically changing county in the U.S.  It is the fastest demographically changing county in the world, not including times of war or military invasion.  This is an invasion nonetheless.  The Whites who remain feel like they&rsquo;re living in a 3rd World country.    In the building in which I live there is a young hispanic girl living in an adjacent apartment who has young men coming and going at a variety of hours.  I suspect it is a case of either drugs or prostitution.  Thank goodness it&rsquo;s not a large operation.  God help us all.</p>

		<p>Where&rsquo;s the outcry?  This is obviously targeting Hispanics and, therefore, has disparate impact.  I&rsquo;m waiting for Sotomayer to come to their rescue.</p>

		<p>Lone White Ranger #1, you have to realize that the illegal aliens essential to keeping up the golf courses in New York, that Mayor Bloomberg said would deteriorate if illegal aliens were deported, have to have some place to go for fun. I mean, if something as serious as existing U.S. immigration law is scoffed at by the politicians, than what&rsquo;s allowing a few whorehouses? It&rsquo;s(the law)all relative to these cretons. </p>

		<p>We need to legalize prostitution, AND FAST!</p>
<p>Since the Bush Regime and now Obama continues) to ship our manufacturing jobs to Communist China, we will have to shift our employment to the &#8220;service sector.&#8221; </p>
<p>Naturally, this means that our children will have to become whores, just like the kids in other third world nations, in order to survive.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t think of these as &#8220;Mexican Brothels&#8221; these are just Twenty-first Century job centers for your children. </p>
<p>Like many other occupations, the illegals are just getting in on the ground floor of just another &#8220;service industry&#8221; job.</p>

<p>I know.  It&rsquo;s incredible that someone, anyone, could use as a rationalization for permitting illegal aliens to come into the country unfettered, such an utterly pathetic and lame excuse as keeping up golf courses. I think this indicates where we are at this point in time.  The forces of political correctness don&rsquo;t even feel a need to make sense, any old reason is a good one, and the reason for this is that Whites are silent.  All they do is run.  Of course there will come a time when they can run no longer.  I take great pride in being a White person who knows what the score is.  All White people who know what&rsquo;s going on must communicate this to other Whites before the country is completely overrun by these 3rd Worlders.</p>

Of course, the women who are kept in these prostitution rings are illegal aliens as well, and are afraid to report what is being done to them. They are told that if they leave, their families back home will be murdered.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has been the case for Ukrainian and Russiam women for more than ten years now, tricked into prostitution when answering ads for &#8220;secretarial work abroad,&#8221; and similar scams.  Once they arrive, their passports are confiscated and they become prisoners by thugs who beat them and threaten their families.  The sad thing is that many of them are sold by friends and even older women that they trust.</p>
<p>But this Mexican prostitution ring situation is not new.  In about 2000 an entire string of them were busted in Southern and Central California.  They were using massage licesnes and chiropactic licenses that were either stolen or in one case actually sold by an unsuccessful Hispanic chiropractor.  Somehow, all these cases never seem to add up with all the other destructive factors of Multiculturalism.  Any culture can stand up to 10% non-native population, but America is almost destroyed.  We are only a few years from chaos, in my estimation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where else to put this, but I just had a conversation with an old friend who still lives in Sacramento, CA where he and I went to high school together.  He has been in health care all his career.  The state is putting people on furlough soon and many offices are down to three day weeks now.  But the big news is that another fellow high school alumni is a guy who works for personnel management for the State.  He says that the State does not like to hire White men because they are viewed as the most litigious - statistically.  So the critical mass has really changed.  Now White men, especially older ones are completely and openly descriminated against because of age, sex and race.  The really amazing thing is that doing this institutionally has been made not just possible, but politically correct.</p>
<p>I have been thinking I have sensed it in the way I am treated in Washington State whenever I have attended classes at the local community college, dealt with any county or state government, or even my last two health care jobs where White women - office staff who were supposed to assist and support me as a doctor - made it impossible to work through various harassments and general disrespect.  I have thought that it was me perhaps, I am such a jerk, etc., but now I have official statistics!</p>
<p>THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DISCRIMINATES AGAINST WHITE MALES AS OFFICIAL POLICY.  It is time to either fix this or leave.  There is not a lot of time left.  If I cannot find work within a year, I will have to leave the U.S., or at least retreat to Alaska.  I would rather freeze to death in Alaska than die on the street in mainland America.  When &#8220;Whiteplight&#8221; disappears, you will know.</p>

		<p>6 Anon: Your post is simply vulgar.  Perhaps you are more familiar with the odors of prostitutes than I am, but I have taught roomfuls of teens and have never noticed the the Latinas smelled any worse than White girls.  Mexicans have enough faults that we don&rsquo;t need to invent any to justify our distaste for them.  </p>

		<p>Lone White Ranger, you are, in fact, living in the Third World. As a quick jaunt by car, down Northern Boulevard, will bring you through Flushing, the epicenter, where it all seems to reach out, to the rest of the Borough. In fact, as soon as you enter that area of Queens, it&rsquo;s as if the Third World toilet backed up, all over Kessena Boulevard. You do not feel like you are in any part of America. Good luck living there.</p>

		<p>1. Lone White Ranger, have you been reporting this activity to the cops?<br>
If INS won&rsquo;t do anything about the illegals, at least Vice may;<br>
at any rate, nothing will change for the better unless upstanding citizens get involved.<br>
