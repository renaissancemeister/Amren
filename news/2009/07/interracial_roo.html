<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/us/08roommate.html?_r=2&amp;hpw">Interracial Roommates Can Reduce Prejudice</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tamar Lewin, New York Times, July 8, 2009</i></p>

	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several recent studies, at Ohio State and elsewhere, have found that having a roommate of a different race can reduce prejudice, diversify friendships and even boost black students&rsquo; academic performance. But, the research found, such relationships are more stressful and more likely to break up than same-race pairings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Russell H. Fazio, an Ohio State psychology professor who has studied interracial roommates there and at Indiana University, discovered an intriguing academic effect. In a study analyzing data on thousands of Ohio State freshmen who lived in dorms, he found that black freshmen who came to college with high standardized test scores earned better grades if they had a white roommate  &mdash;  even if the roommate&rsquo;s test scores were low. The roommate&rsquo;s race had no effect on the grades of white students or low-scoring black students. Perhaps, the study speculated, having a white roommate helps academically prepared black students adjust to a predominantly white university.</p>
<p>That same study found that randomly assigned interracial roommates at Ohio State broke up before the end of the quarter about twice as often as same-race roommates.</p>

		<p>I was assigned a black room-mate my first semester at college.  He and his &#8220;friends&#8221; (which included drug dealers and others having no connection with the university) did nothing but smoke marijuana, listen to loud &#8220;soul&#8221; music, boast about the things they&rsquo;d stolen and the &#8220;bitches&#8221; they&rsquo;d hornswoggled.  The rare times I tried to study in my own dorm room instead of the library, I would be interrupted by offers of marijuana (they couldn&rsquo;t comprehend that anyone would prefer education to &#8220;getting high&#8221;), loud conversation and music, raucous laughter, etc.  I remember one chilling account by a certain &#8220;Wesley,&#8221; who talked of how he wanted to &#8220;off&#8221; the Dean of Students for admonishing him about his academic performance.  Thank God, my &#8220;interracial&#8221; room-mate left that arrangement after only one semester, and I had the room to myself.  </p>

		<p>A WHITE PERSON rooming in a BLACK college dorm means danger and possibly death.  Your personal belongings will dissapear, you will not be allowed to study, you will be called racist, and your life will eventually be threatened.  If you have an athletic scholarship the blacks will attempt to make you loose it so one of their race can get it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Interracial Roommates Can Reduce Prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true.  Such an arrangement will lessen unjust stereotypes of both whites and blacks; however, in the case of whites, they learn that they don&rsquo;t like black rude behavior, loud talk and radios, and they absolutely feel as if they&rsquo;re talking to an eighth grader when they try to converse on a subject, so&hellip;VOILA!&hellip;&hellip;they&rsquo;re prejudices are gone due to the close contact, but, unfortunately, they&rsquo;re replaced with actual fact which places blacks in a much worse light than before.  The whites were far better off with their prejudices, because they were far less damaging to blacks than their true behavior.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to keep whites and blacks separate; separate dorms, separate classrooms, etc., and keep feeding them all the PC propaganda about blacks, and, since they don&rsquo;t have examples to prove the brainwashing incorrect, they unquestionably believe what they&rsquo;re indoctrinated with.</p>
<p>The problem right now is that too many whites are ready to swallow all the PC drivel hook, line and sinker then..WHAMO!&hellip;they come in contact with several blacks, and they learn for themselves what lowly individuals they are.</p>
<p>So, the secret to success is in invoking segregation, not integration, going so far as having them live together.</p>
<p>The high break-up rate is undoubtedly because the white gets to know blacks too well, and he doesn&rsquo;t like what he sees and hears.</p>

		<p>When I was earning my Bachelor of Science degree, many of the teachers at the university I attended had standardized on a workgroup model meaning they divided the class into groups of four or five and informed us that half our grade for their class was determinent on the overall group performance for group projects that would be assigned. </p>
<p>The result was that I had to completly do an Indian&rsquo;s group work that only showed up to class and none of the group meetings half the work for a black and a mexican that were shooting for a C and about a third of the work a rather vocal feminist who was satisfied with a B. Doing all those people&rsquo;s group work at an A level so I could MY A was extremely taxing and basically consumed my life for a couple of years. It was like dying and going to heaven when I finally graduated with an A average and got out from under the modern liberal way of doing things which amounts to nothing more than saddling up the smart people with the stupid lazy ones. </p>

		<p>If I recall correctly the last time I looked at statistics for the university where I work, only one in six blacks completes four years of college.  So, at least 5 of them will be gone sooner or later.</p>
<p>Of course, new ones keep being brought in.  God forbid we ever run out of noise, litter, graffiti &amp; foul language. </p>

		<p>During the mid 1990s, My son had a Black roommate his sophmore year in college. The kids father was a attorney. They actually got along very well and moved into an apartment off campus with another White roommate for their junior and senior years. </p>
<p>Perhaps they were an excpetion.</p>

		<p>ITT Systems and CSA doing government work in the Middle East, particularly Kuwait do the same thing. The companies make a conscious effort to room one white and one black together. The blacks I have worked with overseas are even worse than their usual conduct at home as they think local laws don&rsquo;t apply to Americans (some have found that is not so) Usually, the employees are allowed to self segregate and they do, the black I roomed with was constantly being used by other pimp type blacks so they could drink and smoke pot at our apt. I speak conversational Arabic and told them one more time of this and I will report it to the KUWAITI POLICE!! It didn&rsquo;t happen again and I left for Iraq again shortly after. Familiarity does indeed breed contempt. Weapons are our friends.</p>

		<p>I had a black room-mate in the military barracks.  It lasted about three months before he moved out.  Socially, we had little in common.  He liked hanging out with his black friends, and I with my white friends.  </p>
<p>I studied courses at night, and he messed with my belongings while I was away.  It was a relief when he left.</p>

		<p>These studies and experiments on racism in America are simply propaganda pieces used to bolster the nurture theory of human personality.  The money is handed out by groups that believe that white people are racists, but they can be made to change.    </p>
<p>Notice the parings are white and a minority (really black), not black and Asian or Mexican.  </p>
<p>So Russell H. Fazio, or whoever, goes to the money man and makes his pitch: Is forcing young white people to mix with minorities a good way to change the bad, racist, bigoted, prejudice, evil white person?  To get the funding you tell the foundation that my preliminary findings show yes.  But I need the funds to conduct the study.</p>
<p>Of course the study will have many positive outcomes, but some negative and just hint at solving the problem.  More studies (money) are needed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be offensive, but people that are not white smell different.  I&rsquo;m not saying smell bad, just unpleasantly different.  It is very stressful for polite whites to get away from a black roommate.  To be fair Ohio State and other school should be pro-choice about having the students room with a different race.</p>
<p>How evil is forcing white kids to room with blacks.  Well think of your all-time most evil guy.  Yes it is Hitler.  But even Hitler wouldn&rsquo;t force a white kid to room with a black.  Therefore the anti-choice University administrators who force white kids to room with blacks are worse than Hitler.<br>

		<p>What I remember about college orientation is that my university tried its hardest to mix everyone together, make students of different races talk to each other in diversity discussions, and tell us we were all equal and should accept one another. As soon as all of the students were left to themselves and had no faculty members standing over them, the blacks naturally came together and made friends with each other- even ones they were never in groups with to begin with- NOT with the whites they had met earlier, and vice versa. This kind of natural separation is exactly what the school was trying to avoid, but didn&rsquo;t seem to work even though I am pretty damn certain that just about every one of those students is a diversity-promoting liberal. </p>
<p>The only races who mixed in with the whites were ones that were too few in number to form a group with each other, such as a few Indian kids who kind of wandered into a white group. Whites never exclude anyone nowadays. When people see a few blacks who have nowhere to go sit with whites at a lunch table, they think it means diversity is working, when in fact, it often means they have no one else to associate with.</p>
<p>Now, I am a white female who has recently been paired with a black roommate at my university for this fall. My school apparently thinks she is just like me and that I should trust her completely. Let&rsquo;s see how this works out.</p>

		<p>Well, I cannot speak specifically for dormitories because I have never had to stay in one.</p>
<p>However, I would like to touch on a recent experience of mixed-race, inter-gender dressing rooms.</p>
<p>I was recently in Europe with the dance ensemble I&rsquo;m in for a multi-cultural dance and music festival.  Our group represented Canada, and there were groups representing most of Western and Central Europe (Germany, Switzerland, England, Sweden, Italy), as well as from Colombia, Brazil, and Benin, Africa.</p>
<p>We (the performers) only had a couple of places to change into our costumes near the stage area.  Our dance ensemble usually have both our male and female dancers share the same dressing room and we have repeatedly done so without incident.</p>
<p>Just before one of our on-stage performances, our group president, an under 5-foot, dark brown-haired female dancer, approached me and asked me to do her a favour.</p>
<p>She requested that I perform the simple task of taking her purse and placing it among our belongings in one of the designated change areas.  The reason that she needed me to take it inside for her was because of a complaint she had: &#8220;Those creepy Benin guys keeping hitting on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, she was referring to the handful of black guys from the African group.  I had plenty of room in my costume bag, and they didn&rsquo;t hassle me when I went inside.  So, if mixed-race arrangements are suspect, chances are adding mixed-gender arrangements to it are likely to entail some consequences.<br>

<p>This is standard leftist educational theory, although it has traditionally been limited just to grade schools in America.  As Paolo Freire, the Brazilian educational philosopher explains, forcing smart kids to teach dumb kids will increase their solidarity with the poor and stupid.  It makes the smart kids teach the dumb ones, which (according to Freire) is the way that free liberated teaching occurs.  Freire believes that teachers should merely be facilitators, and not teachers, since &#8220;teaching&#8221; implies that teachers know more than the students and the students should submit to the teachers.</p>
<p>By the time this leftist nonsense gets watered down to American grade school teacher level, it means:  put the students together at tables and not at individual desks.  Have the smart kids do our jobs for us.  Save time and effort by grading 5 tables instead of 30 students.</p>
<p>Google &#8220;Paolo Freire&#8221; for more info.</p>

		<p>In California, the prisons until recently used to segregate newly arrived prisoners for 60 days until they were assessed and acclimated.  But a Black troublemaker with time on his hands sued and the courts forced the prisons to integrate from day one.  This makes the case for 14 hour of hard labor a day.  &#8220;Idle hands are the Devil&rsquo;s playground&#8221;.</p>

<p>Only this time in big fat letters as if to drive my point home while releaving the great frustration this produces in me.</p>
<p>FAMILY: THE MOST BASIC BIO-SOCIAL UNIT SINCE THE PALEOLITHIC AGE IS FALLING APART, AND WE&rsquo;RE TALKING ABOUT RACE!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>WHY??????</p>
<p>IS BEING A FAILURE IN ONE GOING TO MAKE US A SUCCESS IN THE OTHER?!?!?!?!?!</p>
<p>How can the Left go on and on and on (and not simply for decades, but for so long that we can now measure it by generations) about Race and Society without ever mentioning the Matrix of Society, Family?  <br>
And how can they go on and on without noticing that this dissolution of the family has effected both Black and White?</p>
<p>And how is it that the Right has missed the boat on this?<br>
They simply can not get past cliches about Family Values.<br>
If there is one thing that both the Right and the Left could not attack and dismiss enough in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s (in both cases with shockingly immature and ignorant ridicule and sarcasm) it was Family Systems Psychology.  Well, the Talking Points FSP created have stood the test of time, as have the consequences.  In fact, one of the consequences of a broken family, in this case particularly as it relates to abandonment, is now sitting in the White House.<br>
It would have helped to have been armed with the facts. <br>
Guess it is yet another thing we are playing catch-up ball with as the current culture crisis spreads, and its tide rises.<br>

		<p>I think that the inter-racial roommate idea is a great one and I am all for it! The stupid liberals are indeed educating white students with these inter-racial roommate experiences-but the whites are not learning what the liberals expected. Instead, they are learning the simple truth that coloreds are NOT &#8220;people like you and me&#8221;. By ridding our white students of the dangerous delusion that &#8220;diversity&#8221; is a blessing for our country, we might one day find the political will to do what must be done: stop third world immigration and deport coloreds back to their lands of ancestral origin! :)</p>

		<p>Lurking in the background of this man&rsquo;s research findings is the idea that whites and blacks should be forced - for their own good - into more intimate contact than they normally experience in school or the workplace.  I&rsquo;ve heard of experiments in public schools where whites and blacks are forced to sit at the same lunchtable, though I believe this isn&rsquo;t a permanent policy.  But social science research such as this has often been used to justify other kinds of forced race mixing (especially school integration), so I wonder if governments and schools will use these findings in an attempt to force upon us these more intimate types of interracial associations.  I suppose the most radical of these researchers would like to see the mandatory pairing of white girls and black boys in dorm rooms. Or is that merely my paranoid fantasy?   </p>

<p>Do you beleive that there are no White students who use drugs, play loud music, have a steady strem of unannounced visitors and stay up unitrl the wee hours of the morning? </p>
<p>In fact, I would argue that more White students engage in this sort of behavior than Blacks. I am White. I have experienced it firsthand.</p>

<p>The fact is that yes, there are some Blacks (mostly in the upper classes as you described Gene) who raise their children well and teach them how to respect other people. </p>
<p>However, these are the rare exceptions. Nowadays with all the student federal aid and desire for diversity, more than a few colleges let in lower income and poor Blacks from inner cities and all sort of backgrounds who do nothing but create havoc on college campuses. To be sure there is some White trash on college campuses as well, but they are an extremely small minority.</p>

<p>   While I admit that white behavior has generally declined since the eighties, I still find blacks exhibit more of the questionable rude behavior I have elucidated. I have worked in academia for over thirty years in various capacities. I would say that some white students, particularly from the Northeast, copy black &ldquo;bad boy, gangsta&#8221; behavior. </p>
