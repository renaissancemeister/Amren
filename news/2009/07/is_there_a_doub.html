			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner, July 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the night of June 27, Marty Marshall and his family were standing outside a friend&rsquo;s home in Akron, OH. The group had gathered to watch a fireworks display at nearby Firestone Park, the festive night ended suddenly, when the family as well as their friends were brutally attacked by a group of nearly 50 black teenagers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There was no incident which led to the attack, but as the black teenagers approached the Marshall family, they shouted: &#8220;This is our world&#8221; and &#8220;This is a black world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only motivation behind this crime seems to be the fact that the Marshalls are white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marty suffered a concussion and several deep bruises to his eye. He spent five nights in the critical care unit at Akron General Medical Center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the obvious nature of the attack, Akron police have not classified the beating as a hate crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, many believe that this case is only the latest example of a possible bias by law enforcement in crimes which could seemingly qualify as so-called &#8216;hate crimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 2007, a mob beating of a white teenager in Norfolk, VA by black teenagers stirred-up racial tensions and had many of Norfolk&rsquo;s white residents asking why the boy&rsquo;s attackers had not been charged with a hate crime.</p>
<p>The case gained national attention, after a video of the attack was given to the news media and was posted on Youtube.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Again, despite the overwhelming evidence, police did not charge the black teens with a hate crime and downplayed the obvious racial overtones to the case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ultimately, six black teenagers were found responsible for the attack, and were only charged with, and later convicted of misdemeanor assault.</p>
<p>In 2007, there were 3,802 white Americans charged with hate crimes, while only 1,045 black Americans were charged with the same offense.</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>?</p>

		<p>While anyone who commits a hate criem should be charged, the fact is that 95% of hate crimes are perpertrated by Whites, especially White men. thus theyare the ones who are more likely to be prosecuted.</p>
<p>It is simply a fact.</p>

		<p>  Hate crimes laws differ wildly.<br>
  Read the texts for your state and other and you will find that some cover homosexuals but not whites or Jews but not Christians or Blacks but not American Indians and if the group is not mentioned as a group for which the hate crimes law applies then that group(s)CANNOT suffer a hate crime.<br>
  Last week Attorney General Holder was quoted as saying that a Christian Pastor who read the Bible passages against homosexuality would have committed a hate crime and that an attack on a homosexual life style by a Pastor was not protected but statements and actions by a homosexual against the Pastor would be protected under the proposed new Federal Hates Crimes laws.Please watch the news clips and read the articles and tell me if I heard this wrong.</p>

		<p>Of course there is a double standard! From the Jena six, White girls being attacked and beaten severely by a majority black crowd at an attraction somewhere in CA to horrific murders blacks generally get either a slap on the wrist or miss out on the &#8220;hate crime&#8221; enhancement that is often tossed at a White person accused of a crime against a black person. Most of the time where there has been a vicious beat down like this one you will hear that the local police are not &#8220;investigating this as a hate crime&#8221; and then eventually the perpetrators are convicted of something like minor assault or battery and give a slap on the wrist sentence. When these cases make high profile status, Al Shapton or Jesse Jackson will show up and start making noise and threats or the perpetrator will say something like &#8220;they called me the N word&#8221; The victim, who is either dead or suffering from injuries that make him or her unable to remember much of the incident. </p>

		<p> Of course there&rsquo;s a double standard on hate crimes   &mdash;   both in police reluctance to charge blacks with them, and in the mainstream media&rsquo;s squeamishness about using that term to describe attacks by blacks on Whites   &mdash;   like the Marschall incident. And as was mentioned by a poster on this website the other day, when the mainstream media do report on blacks attacking Whites, they usually disable any &#8220;Comments&#8221; section included at the end of the story to keep Whites from pointing out the obvious.</p>
<p> I also noted that one of the posters at the end of this original article pointed out how a home security company&rsquo;s TV ads always are at great pains to show us that the &#8220;bad guy&#8221; breaking into a house is White   &mdash;   never black or Hispanic. When I placed a post on a local website in my hometown calling attention to that ad and criticizing it, I was immediately denounced by other posters as a &#8220;racist.&#8221; Naturally.</p>

		<p>Some of the biggest black apologists in the country are the police brass.  They&rsquo;re nothing if they&rsquo;re not disgusting.</p>
<p>So mentally challenged they believe playing down black on white attacks will make their jobs easier by preventing white reprisals.  They&rsquo;re too dense to understand they&rsquo;re encouraging MORE black on white hate crimes and creating a growing rage in whites, which is going to surface at some point in all its horror.</p>
<p>We know who they are in my general area, and we&rsquo;ve made note of them for future reference.  The whole country should do the same.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve always believed the title &#8216;hate crime&rsquo;, along with differing levels of punishment applied for it is the most asinine and divisive categorization I&rsquo;ve ever heard. Is a white man robbed and killed by a black any less dead than a black man robbed and killed by a white? What a boatload of hooey.</p>

And the vast majority of those whites charged with hate crimes are really Mexicans and other Latinos, considered white by our government for the specific purpose of impugning whites.</p>

		<p>It has long been obvious that &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; were to be a Whites only offense. If the laws were applied equally, minorities would be convicted in the greatest number of offenses so far. From my own life experience I am convinced that Whites in general are the least racist and most fair-minded people. Sadly this is to our detriment. </p>
<p>Africans, Asians, Mestizo Hispanics, East Indians, tend to be openly racist/ethnocentric. Just be observant when you are around any non-whites, you see what I mean. </p>

<p>&#8216;Holder Admits: No Equality Under Hate Bill - by Ted Pike&rsquo;<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnziaXfYhc4&amp;feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnziaXfYhc4&feature;=channel_page</a></p>
<p>From Mr Holders own words&hellip;<br>
&#8220;We&rsquo;re talking about crimes that have a <b>historic basis</b>.&#8221;</p>
<p>That word &#8220;historical&#8221; specifically, means Whites are screwed. </p>
<p>It seems <i>as a group</i>, modern day Whites have to pay their penance for the crimes of <i>some</i> Whites perpetrated in the past.<br>
Ironically we&rsquo;re called racists for making group judgments. Though when you swap the skin colors, discrimination is still discrimination.<br>
Do two wrongs do make a right?</p>
<p>I thought the post racial vision was something along the lines of &#8220;we are all equal individuals who are innocent until proven guilty&#8221;.</p>
<p>The &#8216;true equality&rsquo; ideal will probably be implemented around the year 2050, when it&rsquo;ll be us Whites who&rsquo;ll really be needing some help.  </p>

		<p>This re-affirms my belief that the reason black people act so heinously towards white people is due to the fact they face no punishment if they do.  If a white person retaliates, then the question of racial motivation is raised.  It may be hard to fathom, but at one time black people were afraid of white people, for good reason.  Black people were a lot more polite than they are now, knowing that if trouble breaks out, they can always say someone called them a name or some such tripe and expect to be completely exonerated if not compensated.   </p>
<p>When society tolerates injustice of one group by another, then the aforementioned &#8220;special&#8221; group acts irresponsibly.  Societies goal should be to ensure individuals are not persecuted by groups.  Hate laws are redundant.  It makes no difference if you&rsquo;re beaten to a pulp because you&rsquo;re black, gay, white, etc.  You&rsquo;re no less violated and imposed upon, society should punish the parties responsible equally.  </p>

		<p>blacks are 16 times more likely to murder whites than the reverse, 34 times more likely to assault, 100 times more likely to rob, 600 times more likely to rape whites, and yet are only 2 1/2 times more likely to be charged with an officially designated hate crime. Which considering 2007 hate crime figures, 3,802 white Americans charged with hate crimes vs 1,045 blacks, they are pretty close to be evenly likely to be charged with a hate crime. </p>

		<p>Law enforcement officers around the country are frightened to say or do anything that could get Blacks or any non-White group upset. They have great difficulty in calling a spade a spade with respect to Blacks.  There is no doubt this is a hate crime.  If Fifty Black cowards outnumbering their victims 10 to 1, cries of &#8220;This is our world&#8221; and &#8220;This is a Black world&#8221; is not sufficient evidence of a hate crime against Whites, what is?</p>

The day the whiteman vanishes is the day (Amerika) tuns into South Africa.

		<p>Hate crimes in general should not even be on the books. People should be charged for the crime that they commit and not for whatever opinions or beleif they hold. Case in point: If I were to be assaulted by a group of Black teenagers and I defended myself by beating them to a pulp all while screaming the &#8220;N&#8221; word, then I could get charged with a hate crime even though it was a clear case of self defense.</p>

		<p>The reason that there are extr5emely few hate crime allegations against blacks is that blacks are merely attacking the weak and wealthy &hellip; who just happen to be white.  </p>
<p>White people are perceived as weak in the black community.  When attacked they hand over the wallet immediately. White women do not fight back when raped.  Hence white people are easily dominated.  It is logical to attack them first because the chance of getting away with the crime is great.</p>
<p>Similarly, white people are perceived as wealthy in the black community and therefore offer the best payoff when assaulted, further enhancing the payoff.  </p>
<p>Thus, black on white violence is not based on &#8220;hate&#8221; but on rational criminal decisionmaking.  </p>
<p>This is the rationale that the police use whenever they consider prosecuting something as a hate crime.  It is also the classic defense offered by the defendants to hate crime charges. </p>
<p>I suspect it would not work for white people, however.  Imagine a white man telling the judge that it wasn&rsquo;t a hate crime because he only attacked black folks (or Jews or Asians) because they are weak and/or rich.</p>

		<p>Why hasnt someone sued about this? Obviously hate crimes laws that are applied unequally violate the letter of the 14th amendment that gives &#8220;equal protection&#8221; under the law. Obviously if these miscreants are not charged with a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; then the victims are not getting equal protection are they? I am not sure why there are no constitutional lawyers screaming about this. Actually I am sure but that does not even need to be said does it?</p>

		<p>So sorry to burst your bubble Darius but if you would check out the violent crime statistics, namely black on white crime as opposed to white on black crime, you would learn the real facts: Black people, as a group, are just plain violent. Making up fake percentages won&rsquo;t change that fact. </p>

		<p>One problem with our justice system is that the more people involved in an attack like this, the less time they serve, although it seems obvious that an attack by ten or by fifty is more aggravated than an attack by one.</p>

<p>So, instead of the incredible disparity in regards to hate-crime charges being addressed, the gap has actually increased.</p>
<p>Liberals are always so sensitive about even minute disparities, yet here the figure isn&rsquo;t 10% or 20% or even 50%, here, whites who commit the same crimes are up to hundreds of times more likely to be labeled a hate criminal. That&rsquo;s like thousands of percent difference.   </p>

		<p>If the official figures are close to 3000 and 1000, then the real figures for hate crimes are much higher. A white redneck type burned a cross on a black couples lawn. When they saw it in the morning, they didnt even know what it was, but the whiteboy can get ten years for committing this thought crime.When black multiple assaliants beat a white victim to death or nearly to death,which happens on a regulsr basis, this is almost never counted as a hate crime, because no racial slurs were used(they were only thought).</p>

		<p>Darius claiming that Caucasians commit 95% of hate crimes is just so much mugabedung. Next, he&rsquo;ll be saying he was Michael Jackson&rsquo;s loverboy, and so is entitled to money from his estate.</p>

		<p>If the authorities shy away or completely avoid prosecuting non-whites with hate crimes, what is the point of pointing out the stats?<br>
They&rsquo;ll just paint the picture that the legislators want.<br>
So people like this Darius can say look, nearly 100% of hate crimes are perpetrated by Whites.<br>
Which is the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>The data will simply reflect the bias.<br>
Which is ironic when you think about all the wailing about the unfair US justice system targeting blacks, racial profiling and how crime data should be a-racially recorded, such as it is in this recent Amren story.<br>

<p>And regarding Hate crime legislation favoring those who have had &#8216;historical disadvantages.&rsquo;<br>
There is a great Amren thread from a while back about Captain John Smith arriving in Jamestown in 1607, that I can&rsquo;t get out of my thoughts. <br>
<a href="/news/2009/02/white_men_meet_1.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2009/02/white_men_meet_1.php</a></p>
<p><i>The 105 colonists who arrived in 1607 were so sure of finding gold they entered into what now seem very reckless contracts: In exchange for a one-way ticket to America and a share in the profits, they bound themselves to a set period of service in Virginia &mdash; it appears to have been seven years &mdash; during which they received no pay, had to obey orders, and could not leave. There were no women in this first group.</i></p>
<p>Ok you can say that they motivated by greed in signing this contract (though they found no gold), but they do not sound like &#8216;free men.&rsquo; <br>
And then later&hellip;..</p>
<p><i>On his return to Jamestown on January 2, 1608, Smith found the colony in a bad way. There had been more Indian attacks, and only about 40 of the original 105 settlers were still alive.</i></p>
<p>I appreciate all these connected issued are complicated, but the point I&rsquo;m trying to here is we&rsquo;ve all had it rough.<br>
Down this end of the World we&rsquo;ve failed the Aborigines (they would have been better off never meeting us, but too late now.)And we&rsquo;ve added thirty years plus on the Maori&rsquo;s life expectancy, almost doubling their time on earth.</p>
