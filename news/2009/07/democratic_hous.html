			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, July 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last week, Democratic leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled their health care reform legislation entitled, &#8220;America&rsquo;s Affordable Health Care Act of 2009.&#8221; (Bill Text). Despite the language in section 246 of the bill that states: &#8220;nothing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall allow Federal payments [for] individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States,&#8221; the bill actually raises more questions than it resolves with respect to whether the bill will burden American taxpayers by giving health care benefits to legal and illegal aliens.</p>
<p>The draft House bill  &mdash;  consisting of 1,018 pages  &mdash;  was introduced by Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) and cosponsored by the chairmen of the three House committees of jurisdiction: Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-NY), Chairman of the Ways &amp; Means Committee; Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), Chairmen of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee; and Rep. George Miller (D-CA), Chairman of the Education &amp; Labor Committee.</p>
<p>Section 202 of this bill creates a Health Insurance Exchange (exchange) and states that &#8220;all individuals are eligible to obtain coverage&#8221; through the exchange. The House Education &amp; Labor Committee has produced a summary of the bill and explains that the exchange will allow individuals and employers to &#8220;comparison shop for coverage&#8221; and that the bill creates &#8220;new affordability credits .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for people purchasing [health coverage] through the exchange.&#8221; (Education &amp; Labor Summary).</p>
<p>Under Section 242, all legal aliens will qualify for the affordability credit. Subsection (d) states that the affordability credits &#8220;shall not be treated [as] a benefit provided under section 403&#8221; of the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. Under Welfare Reform, legal aliens are generally required to wait five years before becoming eligible for welfare or other taxpayer funded benefits. The House health reform bill eliminates that 5-year waiting period for legal aliens as applied to taxpayer financed health insurance subsidies, such as the affordability credit. Accordingly, legal aliens will become immediately eligible for this government handout  &mdash;  a handout that would be paid for by the American taxpayers.</p>
<p>Given the bill&rsquo;s language, illegal aliens are also likely to qualify for the affordability credit. This is true because there are no provisions that would prevent an illegal alien from participating in the exchange or from receiving the credit. Likewise, there are no requirements that a government agency verify eligibility, whether through the SAVE system or otherwise. (FAIR&rsquo;s explanation of the SAVE System). Accordingly, without these important safeguards, illegal aliens would probably receive this subsidy. The bill does limit eligibility to individuals who are &#8220;lawfully present in a State in the United States,&#8221; but that language would be ineffective to prevent handouts to illegal aliens. (Sec. 242(a)(1)). Under U.S. immigration law, someone&rsquo;s status as an illegal alien is not determined by lawful presence in a State. As a result, this language will have no effect in preventing illegal aliens from receiving the credit.</p>
<p>Critics suggest that if the intent of the bill is to preclude illegal aliens from receiving this subsidy, the current language is woefully inadequate and would have to be dramatically revised. For example, the bill could limit eligibility for the credit only to a &#8220;qualified alien&#8221; as defined by the Welfare Reform Act, which would preclude illegal aliens from receiving any benefit. In addition, including a provision that requires eligibility verification, with the SAVE system, for every applicant for the credit would likewise prevent illegal aliens from receiving the credit.</p>
<p>At the same time as Congress is considering burdening taxpayers with the cost of health care for legal aliens, Massachusetts appears to be retreating from that idea. Massachusetts is currently the only state to offer so-called &#8220;universal health coverage.&#8221; The Bay State is currently facing a budget crisis brought on by a decline in tax revenue and rising demand for state-financed services. In response, state legislators have recently submitted a budget to eliminate taxpayer subsidized health coverage for approximately 30,000 legal immigrants under the &#8220;Commonwealth Care&#8221; program. (Boston Globe, July 12, 2009; New York Times, July 14, 2009; Boston Globe, July 15, 2009; and SouthCoastToday.com, July 16, 2009).</p>

		<p>How else could the Obama administration get the hospitals to support the health care reform bill? Right now, the hospital provide health care FREE to illegal aliens, by Federal law. Now the feds are offering a way for them to get paid.</p>
<p>Duh&hellip;.this is not hard to understand.<br>

		<p>This whole bill stinks to high Heaven. It&rsquo;s nothing more than the government&rsquo;s attempt to try to control your lives. A side effect would be that all the illegal aliens would vote the Democratic ticket, thus keeping the Dems in power forever. The media will trot out some illegal and claim he was denied medical help. They&rsquo;ll make a big sob story out of it in an attempt to get this bill passed. The service given out by the post office and your local motor vehicle office is coming to healthcare soon.</p>

		<p>These Democrats are doing nothing that is in violation of their party&rsquo;s philosophy. This is perfectly normal for them, and as natural as a baby&rsquo;s smile. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Bill&rsquo;s language will not prevent illegal aliens from receiving medical subsidies.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that monstrous piece of nonsense is made into law, this country will implode long before 2012.</p>
<p>But, either way, were headed for disaster, so I guess it really doesn&rsquo;t matter.  It will just hurry along the inevitable. <br>

		<p>Unless language to keep illegals off public health care is adopted, with proper publicity, this outrage would sink the entire monstrosity that Obama so desperately wants. </p>
<p>Publicity about this handout to illegal bloodsuckers also will really hurt the &#8220;amnesty&#8221; bill the Prez, McCain, the Chamber of Commerce and Obama&rsquo;s La Raza friends will push in the near future.</p>

		<p>Thomas Jefferson, A true man of the Future. Every thing he warned about 200 years ago is coming to pass. Maybe its the nature of power and man, but as we all know there is only one way to stop it and it probably wont happen in this generation, but its not by going to the polling booth. whites are not represented, and have been turned against each other, last but not least we have been told to have no pride, thus whites dont stand together, classic case of divide and conquer. we no longer pose a threat to the power that exist. whites dont reproduce and our main stock is aging. The Romans experienced the same plight.</p>

		<p>Does it really matter if illegals are covered?  Aren&rsquo;t they getting free health care already?  Obama is trying to push this bill through as fast as possible to keep people from finding out what is in it.  On Glen Beck&rsquo;s show tonight, he mentioned that it also has a provision in it where health care providers and medical schools have to give hiring preferences to minorities in order to get federal funding.  </p>
<p>Everything Obama is doing is just a form of stealth reparations.  The cap-and-trade bill had a provision in it where &#8220;low-income&#8221; families (i.e. black people) will get money direct deposited into their bank accounts to cover higher energy costs that the rest of us will have to pay.</p>

		<p>Even more significantly, the health &#8220;reforms&#8221; will also require insurance coverage and public funding for abortion.</p>
