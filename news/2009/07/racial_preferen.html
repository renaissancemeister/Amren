<h1><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/2009/07/racial_preferences_in_the_demo_1.html">Racial Preferences in the Democrats&rsquo; Health Care Bill</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allan J. Favish, American Thinker, July 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Under the Democrats&rsquo; health care bill, if a medical school wants to increase its chances of receiving many different kinds of grants and contracts from the federal government, it should have a demonstrated record of training individuals who are from underrepresented minority groups. This is because the Democrats&rsquo; health care bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give preference to the entities that have demonstrated such a record in the awarding of these contracts to medical schools and other institutions.</p>
<p>The bill does not state what would qualify as a &#8220;demonstrated record&#8221;, so we can expect medical schools and the other entities to do whatever they think they can get away with to train as many &#8220;individuals who are from underrepresented minority groups&#8221; as they think they might need to have a better &#8220;demonstrated record&#8221; in this regard then other entities competing for the grants and contracts.  The Democrats&rsquo; health care bill creates a very significant financial incentive for medical schools and other entities to lower admission standards for &#8220;individuals who are from underrepresented minority groups&#8221; if that is what it takes to have the winning &#8220;demonstrated record&#8221;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On page 881-882 the bill states: &#8220;In awarding grants or contracts under this section, the Secretary shall give preference to entities that have a demonstrated record of the following:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Training individuals who are from underrepresented minority groups or disadvantaged backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On page 884-885 the bill states: &#8220;In awarding grants and contracts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Secretary shall give preference to entities that have a demonstrated record of training .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. individuals who are from underrepresented minority groups or disadvantaged backgrounds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Apart from the legality of such preferences under the U.S. Constitution and the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the unfairness to those who are not &#8220;individuals who are from underrepresented minority groups&#8221;, the Democrats&rsquo; policy will foster the racial preference climate that continues to stigmatize and demean those individuals who receive the preferences. {snip}</p>

		<p>The Obama administration has already instituted racial discrimination against white men in the veterans adminstration health system.</p>
<p>To &#8220;address racial disparities&#8221; in heart problems, the VA is now under orders to withhold care from white men and give that care to blacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite like Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin and the Kulaks, but it is getting close.</p>
<p>Our government wants us dead and gone.  And I fear there is nothing we can do about it.</p>

		<p>Like so many gigantic social-engineering bills to come through the federal government during the last 45 years, this one has all sorts of hidden entitlements and quota quests.</p>
<p>Few folks know that in 1964 the heralded Civil Rights had a brief little plank that endorsed affirmative action and equal rights for homosexuals.  This was done by one Virginia Congressman who sought to get even with the libs who wanted this King-inspired thing to become law.  The Congressman&rsquo;s little snide remark as the entire law sailed through was, &#8220;There.  That&rsquo;ll fix &#8216;em&rsquo;.&#8221; </p>
<p>And brother, didn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait til the blacks are fully in power and in the majority, so that I can scream &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Is there anyone out there foolish enough to think that the white cry of &#8220;racism&#8221; isn&rsquo;t going to fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>We the white race are the best way to describe foolish self defeating behavior.</p>
<p>Maybe blacks are not as intelligent, but they are smarter when it comes to using the system to their benefit.</p>
<p>We have to wait four years or midterm elections.</p>
<p>If there is not a significant voter revolt this time around there will only be blacks in all positions of authority.</p>
<p>Even my own small community now has blacks all over the place.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know who is inviting them or encouraging them but they are all over.</p>
<p>And mostly black men, very few black women, so they are here to take our white women too.</p>

		<p>You can bet that government health care, like everything else government run, will be chalk full of racial preferences for blacks and blatant racial discrimination against people of light.</p>

		<p>It is so unfair to Black Proffesionals to have their competence questioned soley due to their race. I have on occasion been treated by black Doctors, dentists, and Pharmasists that i do not know and never hesitated to assume they were competant. There is no affirmative action in the medical proffesions. </p>
<p>If they change that,&hellip;it is better to be safe than sorry.</p>

<p>I agree with you 100%, but beg to make one point: Playing a sport is not a profession it is a game.  The word has been abused and misused in this application.  This is because no other word is in common use to describe what an athlete is when he gets paid for playing.  Highly paid slave is a possible replacement since players are constantly spoken of as &#8220;being sold&#8221; by one team to another.</p>

		<p>Get ready for &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; health care. </p>
<p>When federal bureaucrats will be deciding who is and who is not qualified as your doctor, their aim will be to increase diversity among doctors and health care workers and to help the &#8220;underrepresented&#8221; minorities move upward, but not necessarily to maximize the length of your healthy life. The interest of patients will slowly give way to the interest of those doctors and their families that suffered from &#8220;past injustices&#8221; or are members of &#8220;under-represented minorities&#8221;</p>

		<p>Anonymous, you are wrong - there is plenty of affirmative action in the health professions.  Blacks admitted to medical school have the lowest MCAT scores, they graduate at a much lower rate, and with the lowest grades.  They pass licensing exams at lower rates, with lower scores.  In short, with few exceptions, they are far less qualified than other physicians.  Totally aside from that, their clientele tends to be heavily black as well, even in the suburbs.  In short, avoid doctors of any ethnicity other than whites trained in American medical schools.  The white doctors will probably be smug, obnoxious, and obsessed with their &#8220;godlike&#8221; status, but they might actually know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
