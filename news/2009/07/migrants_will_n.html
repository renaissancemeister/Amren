			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Whitehead, Telegraph (London), July 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Professor John Salt, from University College London, said that the foreign population in Britain will not shrink during the recession. </p>
<p>He said the country had experienced similar conditions in the 1960s and 1970s, when high levels of immigration were initially halted by an economic downturn. </p>
<p>He said: &#8220;If the pattern of the past is repeated then immigration into the UK might well decline rather less than a lot of people anticipate.&#8221; </p>
<p>A report he co-authored for the Policy Network, a centre-left think tank, concluded: &#8220;The evidence we have been able to gather on past recessions in the UK and more widely in western Europe indicates that foreign immigration falls while unemployment is increasing but only for a limited period.&#8221; </p>
<p>In 2004, Prof Salt was commissioned by the Home Office to draw up estimates of the number of illegal immigrants living in Britain, and produced a figure of 450,000 to 500,000. </p>
<p>His latest warning came as Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, announced he is considering adding an ethical aspect to the new points based system to help reduce the impact of the UK draining away top workers from other countries.</p>
<p>Skilled migrant workers will find it easier to come through the new system if they pledge to invest &#8220;human capital&#8221; in their own country.</p>
<p>He said he could not &#8220;morally justify&#8221; the toll placed on third world countries when workers such as doctors move to Britain. </p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We apply a fundamentally different policy to the developing world than we do to the EU countries. We say to the developing world, &#8216;Here&rsquo;s some finance, here&rsquo;s some trade, but we will take your skilled people.&rsquo; Therefore the dilemma of the governments of the developing world is to say to us, as they do persistently, &#8216;Why are you taking our skills off us?&#8221;&rsquo; <br>

<p>If there is one legitimate argument the third world has against the west, that is it. The obvious answer is that they are taking the skills so that they can drive down wages in first world countries.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Rising unemployment only slows immigration for a limited period, then it resumes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not if the entire economy collapses as the West is going to do by 2012.  For the third world rabble they&rsquo;re going to have to decide what they want to do when there are no jobs and no benefits, due to government bankruptcy:  Steal or go home. </p>
<p>Think I&rsquo;m wrong?  Take a look at California right now.  Think they won&rsquo;t be hitting rock bottom by the middle of next year, with the rest of the country following about a year or so later?</p>
<p>As California goes, so goes the country, and California is in the process of collapsing right now in July, 2009, right before our eyes.</p>
<p>What are they going to do with 20 million destitute people?  The other 10 million or so won&rsquo;t be able to support them.<br>

<p>A sentence that makes no sense.  I wish the intended meaning of this phrase could be made more clear by Englishman, Tom Whitehead.</p>

		<p>Prof. Salt is right.<br>
Recent history tells us that the trend is always and forever upwards - no matter what the government of the dat says, no matter what &#8216;restrictive&rsquo; laws are passed or indeed the state of the economy.</p>

		<p>Los Angeles is the Urumqi of America, and the Mexicans are the Uighers of California. To any white or black person living there, I would think about moving to a safer place. </p>

		<p>This is a worldwide recession. Jobs are hard to come by in MExico as they are here. If you&rsquo;re unemployed, would you rather be in Mexico or in the US? At least here there are all kinds of welfare programs to help out until the economy gets better.</p>

Anyone who believes that any significant number of &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; are going to leave during an economic downturn is a fool.</p>
<p>Regardless of how bad it may get, the economic &#8216;hardship&rsquo; and &#8216;poverty&rsquo; they experience in western nations is nothing compared to their homelands. They&rsquo;ll stay and wait for it to pass.</p>

		<p>If it got real bad here, it would be far worse in 3rd worlds now lowered to 5th world..Think about it, who are the illegal criminals here in the U.S. going to prey upon in their respective countries?</p>
