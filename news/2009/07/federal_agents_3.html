<h1><a href="https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6505651.html">Federal Agents Hunt for Guns, One House at a Time</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dane Schiller, Houston Chronicle, June 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Success on the front lines of a government blitz on gunrunners supplying Mexican drug cartels with Houston weaponry hinges on logging heavy miles and knocking on countless doors. Dozens of agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives  &mdash;  sent here from around the country  &mdash;  are needed to follow what ATF acting director Kenneth Melson described as a &#8220;massive number of investigative leads.&#8221;</p>
<p>All told, Mexican officials in 2008 asked federal agents to trace the origins of more than 7,500 firearms recovered at crime scenes in Mexico. Most of them were traced back to Texas, California and Arizona.</p>
<p>Among other things, the agents are combing neighborhoods and asking people about suspicious purchases as well as seeking explanations as to how their guns ended up used in murders, kidnappings and other crimes in Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Firearms dealers visited</b></p>
<p>The ATF recently dispatched 100 veteran agents to its Houston division, which reaches to the border.</p>
<p>The mission is especially challenging because, officials say, that while Houston is the number one point of origin for weapons traced back to the United States from Mexico, the government can&rsquo;t compile databases on gun owners under federal law.</p>
<p>Agents instead review firearms dealers&rsquo; records in person.</p>
<p>People who are legally in the United States and have clean criminal records, but are facing economic problems are often recruited by traffickers to buy weapons on their behalf in order to shield themselves from scrutiny.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Best information source</b></p>
<p>On second thought, Sloan [an ATF agent] switched to Spanish and interviewed a neighbor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The night before, the duo were in a stakeout where they watched a weapons sale.</p>
<p>They also combined efforts with the Drug Enforcement Administration for an aircraft to stealthily follow traffickers to the border.</p>
<p>On this day, agents weren&rsquo;t wearing raid jackets or combat boots and weren&rsquo;t armed with warrants.</p>

		<p>This is based on the discredited theory that American legal guns are spilling south across the fiction formerly known as the border.  The truth of the matter is vice versa   &mdash;   most of the guns are flowing the other way.</p>
<p>The Federal government will spend time and money on this, which is probably unconstitutional, and which will stop when La Raza/Mecha/MALDEF/ACLU/ADL/SPLC start whining about racial profiling, but they won&rsquo;t spend dime one to prevent ganged up illegals from moving from south to north to get the very few guns that move the other way.</p>

		<p>The federal police will soon consist of MANY more blacks, plus there will be ACORN members and the Obama Youth Corps that will also be looking for guns in white hands.</p>
<p>Reminds me of a novel I read once that described black confiscations, but I don&rsquo;t remember what it was.</p>
<p>And, in the meantime, we have an armed radical international leftist group distributing pamphlets entitled, &#8220;The Coming Insurrection,&#8221; which encourages leftists to arm themselves and take control of the country via armed conflict.  This is a valid threat, considering the afore-mentioned groups, plus the ones who scream, cry, curse and rave hysterically at the G-8 meetings and those involving capitalists.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why Homeland Security isn&rsquo;t concerned with them, rather than regarding middle class whites who have tea parties as terrorists, I think &#8220;like-minded&#8221; might explain things in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Sorry, but the guns being used down there are mostly M-16 series that WE gave the Hondos, Salvs, Mexican police/Army and Guatemalans. They are MUCH cheaper when acquired in that manner so we all know this is just the beginning ploy to disarm the population. What will come next is rather troubling.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea that would be far more productive for Mexico and the U.S.Why not have the Mexican Army and police go house to house in Mexico looking for guns.Meanwhile in the US we go house to house (prisons would be a good place to look also) for illegal aliens.In the interest of free trade we would swap the illegal aliens for the guns.</p>

<p>Readers of this web site need to visit Neighborhood 21.com and view a video that&rsquo;s entitled, &#8220;Oath Keeper Sheriff Richard Mack&#8221;. This video is just over seven minutes long, but  worthwhile watching. Then pass it on to others you know. </p>

<p>No, it won&rsquo;t stop.  Because all those groups are 100% in favor of disarming racial minorities.  (As were the Founding Fathers.)</p>
<p>Gun control is the Grand Exception to minority whining.  Because they know what their own people are like.  And they don&rsquo;t want them to have access to dangerous weapons.  (And rightfully so.)</p>

		<p>As an ignorant young person I studied Marxist revolutionary strategy many years ago. I know exactly what Obama intends to do with his &#8220;civilian security corp, which is just as powerful, just as well funded as the military&#8221;. </p>
<p>This &#8220;security force&#8221; is a People&rsquo;s Revolutionary Vanguard. They will eventually be set loose against the &#8220;reactionary forces&#8221; or &#8220;counter revolutionaries&#8221;, that is, you and me and all other Americans who still believe in the Constitution and who resist the final conversion of our country into a Third World Marxist dictatorship. </p>
<p>It will happen something like this in the not too distant future: </p>
<p>With the brainwashed millions pouring out of the public schools and universities, amnesty for 45 million illegal invaders who vote Democratic and the ongoing indoctrination of the main stream media and below replacement rate birth rates for real core Americans, what comes next is inevitable. Just do the math. </p>
<p>As the dumbed down Third world population grows, so will there be growing Third World problems: mounting economic collapse, hunger, disease, social chaos, violence&hellip;the government will blame it all on traditional America and tout Marxist style, central government control as the answer. All who resist will be declared &#8220;enemies of the people&#8221;.</p>
<p>Imagine the values taken for granted many years ago now being demonized, denounced and criminalized. </p>
<p>Imagine Christians being hunted down, tried and jailed for &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;, NRA member&rsquo;s doors being kicked in at midnight by special &#8220;Public Safety Squads&#8221; (gun confiscation goons), parents arrested for home schooling, your kids being indoctrinated into Marxism in school, while you fear being &#8220;turned in&#8221; by them to the local PC watch dogs and sent to &#8220;re-education&#8221; centers.  </p>
<p>Civil War Two sets the nation ablaze, first as guerrilla actions, then consuming whole sections of the country. The two sides will be rural, traditional, Judeo Christian America vs. urban, inner city, secular Humanistic, Marxist &#8220;America&#8221;. </p>
<p>As whole pieces of the country secede and declare war, Obama, (or whoever takes his place by then) declares it&rsquo;s time to finish things once and for all and unleashes his &#8220;civilian security force&#8221; against rural, traditional, mostly white, America. </p>
<p>He will eloquently explain how the only thing standing between an end to the chaos and starvation and paradise on earth are those dirty, rotten, racist, redneck, reactionary white hill billies out in the boonies who are too dumb to awaken to the new age of government controlled heaven on earth. </p>
<p>Thus, they have to be eliminated. Picture tens of thousands of former gang members, now with military weapons and training, flooding out into the country side to &#8220;crush the counter revolutionaries&#8221;,  just as Mao sent out his &#8220;Red Guard&#8221; to usher in the &#8220;Cultural Revolution&#8221;. </p>
<p>Make no mistake: &#8220;liberalism&#8221; IS Marxism. It is the same secular humanistic, dialectical materialist psychology. Just compare &#8220;liberalism&rsquo;s&#8221; main philosophical outlook with classical Marxism. </p>
<p>Also make no mistake: Obama is a revolutionary, not a &#8220;liberal&#8221; or &#8220;democrat&#8221;. This was all planned out long ago in Bill Ayer&rsquo;s living room. Following the Saul Alinsky / Marxist method; lie, say anything to get elected, then destroy and transform from within as radically as you can safely get away with. At a certain point, you can come out of the closet and finish things off. But Marxism teaches about the inevitability of violence during class warfare. Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;civilian security corp&#8221; is the seed of preparation for the future, to be ready for that day. </p>
<p>So&hellip;Obama is merely preparing for the future. Are we? <br>

		<p>&#8220;How can the woman living here buy four high-end handguns in one day?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;It turned out two handguns, of a type drug gangsters prefer, were bought by a pastor for target practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good!! Go after the people that are violating the law and leave the rest of us alone.</p>
<p>I have read several of these articles about us supplying guns to Mexico.</p>
<p>First Mexico has only one gun store in the whole country and that is controlled by the Army. So if an honest Mexican wants to buy a gun for protection, then it is easier for them to buy it here in the Untied States than in their own county.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105848207" rel="nofollow">https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105848207</a></p>
<p>Mexico cherry picks the guns they send to the United States for testing. Many of the guns used by the dug dealers originally belonged to the Mexican army. Mexico is not going to send them to the United States. Also they are probably sending the ones they know came from the United States in order to make it seem like we are the problem.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a matter of &#8220;fear&#8221; that offers us our greatest threat, nor is it fear we should be preparing for.  Most  important is in knowing our enemies who do INDEED amount to MUCH MORE than &#8220;Brownie Scouts.&#8221; </p>
<p>There will be much head to head conflict between many various groups, mostly along lines of race, and a small faction of radical leftist whites should not be dismissed so easily. A  good portion of them have control of most of the organs of communication.</p>
<p>I think Tom Chittum&rsquo;s book, Civil War II, still offers the most accurate scenario of our coming strife.  He has most certainly been &#8220;right on&#8221; so far.</p>
<p>If there is one aspect to the coming break-up he didn&rsquo;t consider, it is the political division within the white community which will have a heavy Marxist tinge just as the above poster mentions. </p>

		<p>There was an article about this in the LA Times a couple weeks back, with a photo.  A photo of a row of Walther P-38s, with a P-08 Luger in the middle.  Just to make sure that the stupid masses got the right idea, the camera was angled just so the swastika on the top of the Luger showed up clearly.  Funny, I thought those guns came from Europe, about 65 or 70 years ago.  </p>

		<p>10 Anon: We should be careful not to repeat the error of the Confederacy in thinking that &#8220;One Southern boy can whip three Yankees&#8221;.  Our estimation of the fighting qualities of the Obama Youth Corps needs to be sober minded.  I think they would have grave deficiencies myself, but I don&rsquo;t think that the Rulers really intend to put a wholly dysfunctional organization together.  </p>

		<p>What did Mexico do with all of the FN-FAL rifles that the U.N gave them, after they upgraded to M-16&rsquo;s? The Mexicans adopted the FAL in 1980. Several years ago, there was a story about a rancher who was held at gunpoint by Mexican soldiers on the U.S. side of the border. The accompanying pictures showed the solders&rsquo; full auto FN-FAL&rsquo;s that had been confiscated from them, and later returned when the war criminals were repatriated.</p>

		<p>Yes, everyone should read Tom Chittums book, &#8220;Civil War Two&#8221;. I agree with the poster who said he didn&rsquo;t for see the political divisions in the white community. <br>
I think any civil conflict in the near future will be along political and cultural lines more than just race. <br>
The two very distinct groups right now are the &#8220;liberals&#8221; or Marxist Secular Humanists, and real Americans, be they libertarians, conservatives, republicans, anyone whose life is still based on Judeo-Christian philosophy, even if they consider themselves atheists. <br>
This is the main fault line. These two groups see the world in completely different and irreconcilable ways. Real Americans operate on the principle that there is a higher order to the universe and they are obligated to align their behaviors with those laws of morality. They understand they have total freedom to do what they want BUT they must accept the consequences of their actions. <br>
Liberal/Marxists, however, accept NO higher order to the universe other than their own immediate emotional and physical impulses. Nothing is ever their fault and everyone else is to blame if something goes wrong. The upper class liberals are intellectuals who feel so smart they feel THEY are God. They will remake society as they see fit. </p>
<p>These two views you see running like a giant fault line through all political policies and laws. They cannot be reconciled. They are mutally exclusive. </p>

		<p>For the 2010 census, acorn (oops, I mean census) workers will be going door-to-door asking intrusive questions such as &#8220;what time do you leave for work?&#8221; &#8220;What are your normal work hours?&#8221; etc.  This sure looks like a set-up for criminals to invade the residences of law-abiding citizens at their leisure.  I suggest NO cooperation with the acorn (oops, I mean census) workers who comes to the door.  If you get the mail-in form LIE.  Since we were underrepresented in the election, we can take back the numbers by messing with the apportionment figures.  If you are white and live in a rural or suburban area, you should have at least SIX people in your household.  Constitutionally, the only question your are required to answer is the number of people in the &#8220;household&#8221;.  All other questions are none of their d@mned business.<br>
Remember acorn&rsquo;s shenanigans in the 2008 &#8220;elections&#8221;  &mdash;  we can take the census.</p>

		<p>&#8220;IN GOD WE TRUST&#8221; is still on the U.S. coins and many rumors abounded that it had been removed. We knew right away it had been put on the edge BUT if we don&rsquo;t watch closely, a simple stamp program change will erase all we have fought for. Muslim countries have their Allah all over it and Jordan is &#8220;the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan&#8221; What is a hashemite? I do not believe in god in any form but I want &#8220;IN GOD WE TRUST&#8221; conspicuously on our currency and to heck with the muslims.</p>

		<p>Yes, we all know why they moved &#8220;In God We Trust&#8221; to the EDGE of the coin&hellip;just another few years&hellip;another few million brainwashed kids coming out of college&hellip;and then it will move from the edge to &#8220;over the edge&#8221;. Good riddance of the &#8220;opiate of the masses&#8221;. The new Super State, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat&#8221; will be the new God. Make no mistake, there will still be Gods the men worship&hellip;but WHICH Gods? Love they neighbor as thyself? Or &#8220;Submit to the Will of the State&#8221;? <br>
There&rsquo;s alot of nutty people who have distorted and twisted religion into something corrupt and dangerous, but without higher principles for society to follow, where do we end up? If we are just higher animals&hellip;then what if we start behaving like animals? Didn&rsquo;t they try this already in the Soviet Union 70 years ago? What were the results? <br>
That&rsquo;s the important issue; there are alot of &#8220;athiests&#8221; who still are very moral and ethical people, who try to organize their life around higher principles. Maybe they are more &#8220;religious&#8221; than hypocrites who go to a church regularly but don&rsquo;t walk the talk&hellip;<br>
Sure, let&rsquo;s get rid of hypocritical man distorted religion..but replace it with Karl Marx? I don&rsquo;t think so. </p>

		<p>The Obama Youth Corps would consist primarily of blacks.  If anyone believes blacks are superior combatants against whites I suggest you buy &#8220;Soldiers for Hire&#8221; from the History Channel website.  Granted, your average white isn&rsquo;t as skilled as the white mercenaries depicted in the documentary, but the average black is as cowardly and incompetent as the black rebels depicted in this documentary.  American blacks and hispanics utilize the drive-by shooting because they lack the courage and skill to engage their adversaries in a stand-up firefight&hellip;</p>

		<p>Even though the Obama Youth Corp may be incompetent and cowardly, tens of thousands of such people armed and controlled by more competent superiors can wreak terrible destruction on communities in their path. Especially if such a group were backed by more professionally organized and equipped troops, such as a radicalized U.S. Army, told they are &#8220;putting down an insurrection&#8221;. </p>
<p>There will be very heavy and viscious fighting. </p>

		<p>Skip, &#8220;just wanting to irritate the Muslims&#8221; (fundamentalist, militant, bad Muslims) is a perfectly righteous goal. </p>

		<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve been working slowly&hellip;so each year there are fewer and fewer people that think of themselves as &#8220;Americans&#8221;. We must understand, it&rsquo;s all accomplished through Psychological Warfare in the media, schools and universities. <br>
Many young people coming out of schools now openly voice their disgust with &#8220;America&#8221;, the American flag, American history&hellip;they know only guilt and shame of &#8220;all the terrible things we&rsquo;ve done&#8221;. <br>
They are no longer Americans. They have been brainwashed and indoctrinated. They will NOT fight for their &#8220;country&#8221; because they no longer belive in &#8220;their country&#8221;. They have no idea what that even means. <br>
To the brainwashed, <br>
Multiculturalism is more important than preserving &#8220;American Culture&#8221; whatever that is. <br>
&#8220;Not being a racist&#8221; is more important than standing up for the truth. <br>
Defend the Constitution? Isn&rsquo;t that just some out moded peice of paper created by old dead slave owning evil white men? Why defend it? <br>
We could go on and on. <br>
If you stood up on a soap box in any typical big city in America or university and screamed, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s fight for America!&#8221;. <br>
No one but a handful would have any idea what you were talking about. <br>
Most would think YOU were the enemy, racist, bigoted, fascist, dangerous extremist. YOU would be attacked by a mob, in all probability. <br>
Wave a flag? Be a fascist. <br>
You see how it works?? <br>
We have been transformed from within!!! So slowly and quietly we haven&rsquo;t even realized it!! <br>
45 million illegals coming in the last 30 years, vote 85% for the Democrats/liberals/Marxists!! <br>
Will real Americans EVER be able to win another election?? <br>
People must completely pull out of the media, universities and publics schools and begin to actively teach and write and make movies and inspire the next generation or&hellip;the America many of us grew up with will just be a footnote in a history book a hundred years from now. </p>
