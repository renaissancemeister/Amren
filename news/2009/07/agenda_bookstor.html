<h1><a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2009/07/26/t12.html">Agenda Bookstore Hosts Far-Rightist for Book Signing</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Vella, Malta Today, July 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Agenda Bookstore last week granted floor-space to far-rightist Norman Lowell, for the book-signing event of his reprinted book &#8216;Imperium Europa&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Carrying the boisterous tagline &#8216;The Book that Changed the World&rsquo;, the book is described as a &#8220;radical response to the all important questions of the survival of the Europid race  &mdash;  that race of biological aristocrats that gave the world everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ignoring a direct question on why his retail chain had hosted Lowell for a book-signing, chief executive Malcolm Miller said his company &#8220;encouraged freedom of expression&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Agenda Bookshop carries thousands of books with a huge diversity of opinion. We do not act as censors, and if anything always encourage freedom of expression. It is up to the reader to decide what they want to read and not our job to obstruct the availability of any material.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miller did not reply as to what policy Agenda operates when it grants publicity to authors such as Lowell, whose anti-immigrant sentiment had led to a conviction for incitement to racial hatred.</p>
<p>Lowell was convicted on three charges of incitement, and was handed down a two-year sentence, suspended for four years.</p>
<p>Writing in his internet forum on his book, Lowell says &#8220;a great destiny&#8221; awaits Malta. &#8220;Our island .&nbsp;.&nbsp; will become a beacon for all Europids; [a] Mecca of the White Man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lowell&rsquo;s book also includes forewords by right-wingers Tomislav Sunic and Constantin von Hoffmeister. Tomislav Sunic is an anti-Semitic author who collaborates with the racist Council of Conservative Citizens as well as the American Renaissance group. Von Hoffmeister is also a contributor to American neo-Nazi e-publication Stormfront.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read some of this mans opinions&hellip;Very interesting that he was given the opportunity to a public book signing! He pulls no punches and seems accurate concerning the onslaught of dark immigrants ever at the borders of white countries seeking white women and succor. Basically he wants to create a new Roman Empire, re-establishing Latin as the Lingua Franca With a ruling elite Alla Plato&rsquo;s Republic. He lacks nothing in ambition but is obviously extreme almost cinematically. I don&rsquo;t think us American guys can go this formal. Still I think its important that these views be available in the great global debates in sculpting our future. As well Thank You Amren for the Courage to Keep available an open market place of political ideas so seminal to Western White Culture.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be joking. The Maltese are White since when exactly? They are a Semitic people, speaking a Semitic language with a Europeanized upper class. Nothing more. What accident of history makes the Maltese White when the Tunisians clearly are not. Maltese are Africans, not Europeans and these &#8220;right-wing&#8221; groups are simply deluded. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Incitement to racial hatred&#8221; has become the standard phrase in the white nations with no freedom of speech, and is recognized by the public.  It is said and written so casually, as if it is and should be a natural part of our social mores, which is why it seems reasonable, why it slips past the concious min of the ordinary boob on the street, not given to complex thinking.</p>
<p>White patriots should begin using the phrase &#8220;incitement to racial preservation&#8221; just as often and as casually, to counter this use of propaganda from the controlled established authorities and press.  </p>
<p>A direct counter-argument or phrase, as pointed and as accurate in language as possible, is oten more useful than justifications of a position.  I think this is a good one that fits the bill&hellip;</p>

		<p>He is probably harking back to the very White, European Knights of Malta who used the island of Malta as a forward defensive of Europe against Muslim invaders, Berber, Arab and Turkish for a thousand years. Malta also has some prehistoric stone structures that like Stonehenge and others were built by prehistoric White men thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>Malta is a strategic island, as strategic as Hawaii is for the defense of America against Asian agressors.</p>
<p>But nowdays Malta is basically a Christian Arab whose biggest exports are pimps who flourish in England.</p>

		<p>The concept of white enclaves is interesting. I have thought about where these might be located. The Baja, Oz, (after and aqueduct from New Guinea is built), Britain, Long Island, NZ and Madagascar come to mind. Whites may have to grab islands and peninsulas and then fight to keep them. As their wealth and power grow, they then might recolonize their lost lands. It&rsquo;s even possible the Chinese would host a white colony to preserve the white race and its innovative talents.</p>

<p>Libs have certainly set the standard. Someone should be made to pay for the racial murder and rapes (20,000 each year of white women) in the USA. It had to come from somewhere, hate-speech. Round them up.  </p>

		<p>Maltese seem to be closest to south Italians/Sicilians (in terms of culture, food, religion, and a lot of their ancestry) and Christian Lebanese (in terms of language, religion and ancient connections to the Phoenicians).<br>
I know that virtually no WN&rsquo;s consider Christian Lebanese to be white, and many Sicilians are likely to be considered non-white by a significant minority of WN&rsquo;s in the US and Northern Europe.<br>
Also, the Maltese lack the degree of sub-Saharan African ancestry found in many Maghrebis (with the exception of the Kabyle and Riffian Berbers).<br>
Do Maltese people look like Northern Europeans? Not usually. Are they Caucasoid? Of course. Are they part of Western culture? Probably. They are Christian, and their island played a major role in the defense of Europe from the Ottoman Muslim invasion.  They don&rsquo;t speak an Indo-European language, but neither do the Finns, Hungarians or Basques.</p>

		<p>The distinction between white and non-white will always be fuzzier at geographic border areas.  And the rules are subject to confusion as well.  Certain Iranians and Indians obviously have more in common with Indo-European genetic and linguistic roots than a Finn, but I&rsquo;d personally prefer to live in a Finnish city than an Iranian one.  Genetics isn&rsquo;t everything.   </p>
<p>ENwhiten, </p>
<p>Talking about white colonies is extremely premature.  There are still a lot of areas in this country that are nearly all-white:  <br>
<a href="/wiki/File_New_2000_white_percent.gif" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:New_2000_white_percent.gif</a><br>
Of course, small amounts of non-whites are in these areas too, but I have no sympathy for someone who thinks the black people who happen to live in North Dakota or Wyoming present some sort of problem.  We should be civil to them and go about our business   &mdash;   the business of keeping these vast areas white and stocked with high-quality people.  As it is now, many of the best and brightest migrate to multiculural metropolitan areas.  </p>
<p>The goal should be to fight for a political and economic order that allows young white adults to stay and have families in these overwhelmingly white areas.  And to fight for a cultural order that will encourage them to raise healthy children that are proud of their ancestors&rsquo; accomplishments.    </p>
<p>Everything else is just a destraction.  </p>

		<p>I visited Malta recently for the first time, but I have met Norman Lowell and have heard him speak more than once.<br>
 The island and its inhabitants are unquestionably European, but does that mean that they are white? That that question can be posed illustrates the confusion which perpetually surrounds this question of &#8220;whiteness&#8221;, and the confusion arises from the fact that whites are merely the people at the pale end of the caucasoid sub-species - so where do you draw the line? I think that the word &#8220;white&#8221;, when used as an ethnic description, should only sensibly be applied to Europeans because we are, with exceptions,an identifiable ethnicity distinguished from other caucasoids (Berbers, Indians, Arabs, Kurds, Iranians etc.)not by genetics, but by history, culture, way of life and - above all - by religion. Thus the Maltese, as Europeans, are most certainly &#8220;white&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>The Maltese are white. They resemble any other Med population of Spain, Italy or Greece. Some are blondes, most brunette, but all of caucasian aspect. I knew a guy who married a Maltese girl. He was white and he definitely did not consider his to be a &#8220;mixed&#8221; marrige.</p>

		<p>Some folks here have a fairly narrow definition of white, one that excludes Maltese (and other borderline ethnicities such as Georgians and Armenians). I&rsquo;ve even seen people on this site question whether Greeks and southern Italians are really white. </p>
