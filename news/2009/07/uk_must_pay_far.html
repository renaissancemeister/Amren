<h1>UK Must Pay Farm Compensation: Pres Mugabe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>TZG/Reuters/AFP, July 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe made an appeal to investors on Thursday and said laws limiting foreign ownership of businesses had been misunderstood and should not seen as a discouragement. He also said that Britain must pay compensation for farms acquired by government.</p>
<p>With an inclusive Government in place formed by President Mugabe, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and DPM Arthur Mutambara, Zimbabwe is trying to recover from economic collapse that the president blames on illegal sanctions imposed by the Britain and her allies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Foreign direct investment is most welcomed as it brings new technology, capital and new markets,&#8221; President Mugabe told an investment conference in Zimbabwe that drew foreign fund managers, financiers, investors and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such policies as the indigenisation and economic empowerment act should not be viewed as obstacles to investment promotion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They should be welcomed as promotive of the greater participation of our people in the economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Mugabe said conditions in Zimbabwe favoured investment following the formation of the inclusive Government.</p>
<p>&#8220;The formation of the inclusive government has strengthened our stable political environment making us more conducive to investment promotion,&#8221; he asserted.</p>
<p>On land reform, President Mugabe said that former colonial ruler Britain was responsible for paying owners who were stripped of their farms. He blames Western sanctions for Zimbabwe&rsquo;s economic decline.</p>
<p>President Mugabe said some white farmers would be spared under the current land acquisition and urged Britain to compensate owners of property seized for redistribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not every white farm which will be taken. Not necessarily,&#8221; President Mugabe said in reply to the leader of the predominantly-white Commercial Farmers Union (CFU), Trevor Gifford at the conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;The responsibility of compensation rests on the shoulders of the British Government and its allies,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We pay compensation for developments and improvements. That&rsquo;s our obligation and we have honoured that. Above all Zimbabwe upholds the sanctity of property rights.</p>

		<p>Typical African despot, whether it&rsquo;s in Rhodesia or Washington, D.C. or Detroit.  He lives in a palace and has a fleet of luxury cars while the public stupidly supports him.</p>

		<p>Mugabe has his thugs kill white farmers and steal their land and has the gall to say that Zimbabwe upholds the sanctity of property rights.  What a joke.  Where is the outrage from the rest of the world?  Oh, that&rsquo;s right, Mugabe is a black Marxist totalitarian despot, so nothing will be done.</p>

		<p>Britain, and the rest of the White world should help Rhodesian Whites emigrate and start new lives in a White country.  There should be no foreign aid or even trade with Zimbabwe.  Let them destroy each other.  </p>
<p>None of this will happen.  Whites will turn their backs on their fellows, continue to allow their homelands to be invaded by non-Whites, and subsidize third world despots.</p>

		<p>Why does the UK have an open door policy for blacks but won&rsquo;t readily repatriate former loyal white subjects?  That is why I see little hope&hellip;our people do not support our people, even when they are being savagely murdered, let alone dispossessed.<br>

<p>You know, there really are limits to everything, even white weakness and stupidity!</p>
<p>Comrade Mugabe is clearly a limit, that not only and above all Great Britain, but also all of the West as well, must view as an unscrupulous enemy and should accordingly eradicate. If that means having him poisoned or shot, good enough; however, if it requires that Britain detonate a thermo nuclear device over Harare or Lusaka to achieve the same end instead, so be it. </p>
<p>Does that sound harsh or even &ldquo;radical&rdquo; to anyone, because thousands or maybe even millions of &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; blacks might be smote with him? </p>
<p>If so, please reflect on the fact that they: put him in power, savored, and participated in, his terrorizing of the legitimate white governors and producers in that country. Now that they are starving under his Communist dictatorship and he heads an utterly failed &ldquo;state&rdquo; called Zimbabwe, they want us to compensate them for their idiotic attempts at being &ldquo;equal&rdquo; to the whites that made Rhodesia a country worthy of the definition, and they committed acts of genocide against. </p>
<p>I say no, never; let them starve, let them die, and let them rot in the high African sun.</p>
<p>250,000 whites once lived in and made Rhodesia prosperous; until those 250,000 members of the white race are returned to the West with interest, those viciously parasitical blacks should be left without compunction  by the entire West to their fate, and its &ldquo;fortunes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John PM!!!</p>

		<p>Just like ol&rsquo; Sam Brownback, who ran for the U.S. presidency. He said at a town hall meeting that Afrikaners and other whites in Africa should be looked at closely for emigration, since they may be &#8220;racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve said before, pray for collapse.</p>

		<p>RHODESIAN PENSIONERS DESTITUTE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM<br>
In December last year, the British Government was accused of deserting hundreds of pensioners who served the Crown in pre-independence Zimbabwe. A report indicated that the pensioners, mainly white, had been rendered destitute because no country – including Britain – recognized any obligation towards them. The Zimbabwean Government, which is legally obliged to pay their pensions, stopped the payments in 2003. According to the Zimbabwean Government, the payments to former civil servants living overseas stopped in 2003 when Britain withdrew aid as agreed at the Lancaster House Conference of 1978-9.Those in Zimbabwe still get their pensions - but hyperinflation has destroyed their value. Campaigners believe that Britain has a moral obligation to help people who served the Crown before Zimbabwe&rsquo;s independence. Most are now believed to live in South Africa, with a few hundred in Britain and Zimbabwe. &#8220;We have over 1,700 names of Zimbabwe pensioners on our database, many of whom are too proud to ask for help,&#8221; said John Redfern, the chairman of the Flame Lily Foundation, which helps the former officials. &#8220;They have been treated as if they don&rsquo;t exist by the country they came from and once loyally served. It is scandalous that a wealthy country like Britain has just abandoned them to their fate.&#8221;When Zimbabwe won independence, President Mugabe&rsquo;s new Government assumed formal responsibility for the pensions of civil servants who had worked for the old Rhodesian administration. At Britain&rsquo;s urging, this commitment was written into Zimbabwe&rsquo;s new Lancaster House Constitution. The CFO argues that all legal obligations towards retired civil servants accordingly transferred to Zimbabwe. It also points out that these former officials were never employed by the British Government through the Colonial Service. They worked for Rhodesia - which had self-government from 1923 onwards and unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965. The latest move to repatriate families to Britain is likely to worsen already frosty diplomatic relations between Zimbabwe and Britain.</p>

<p>I see your point. If you are a true WN and believe in maximum racial separation, whites have no business living in Africa.  One cannot be hypocrytical in not wanting non-whites in white lands and argue for white minority rights in non- white lands!    </p>

		<p>In all of the western countries where there continues to be a high rate of black immigration, look for civil war.</p>
<p>While there are many blacks in some countries the atrocities are not yet sufficient to cause a backlash, but I feel quite confident that one day there will be a severe backlash.</p>
<p>The pendelum swings far left but will swing back far right.</p>
<p>I expect that in short order there will not be sufficient police or military to maintain order.  Vigilantism will rule.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t kid yourself.  There are a lot of WN who would like nothing better than to repatriate every non-White back to the countries of their ancestry, while having Whites living in Africa return to theirs.</p>
<p>Tell me though: if this were to happen, who do you think would ultimately be in better shape because of it?</p>

<p>I think you are just reiterating what I&rsquo;m saying; which is Whites have no business  living in non-White lands and vice-versa, right? So essentially, Robert Mugabe is inadvertantly the WN movement&rsquo;s greatest ally. Both want to see racial exclusivity in their respective societies unlike Libertarians, Neo-Cons, Liberals, Capitalists, Socialists, Evengelicals, the Catholic Church&hellip;.</p>
<p>Tell me though: if this were to happen, who do you think would ultimately be in better shape because of it?</p>
<p>Who cares? The racial separation ideology was never predicated on economic premises of &#8220;better off&#8221;.  The leader of this movement himself says that whites have a right to live among their own for &#8220;good reasons, bad reasons, or no reasons at all&#8221;.  Judging by convential indicators such as per capita income (and thereby tax contributions), crime rates, educational achievements and the like, few would argue that Asians on average are accretive to U.S. Economic well being. As such, would you support importing a largeamount of Asians to America? Probably not, right? So essentially Mugabe is the poster child of the WN dream; a leader who believes that his country belongs to it&rsquo;s native indigenous people and not to transplants from distsnts cultures and continents.    <br>
