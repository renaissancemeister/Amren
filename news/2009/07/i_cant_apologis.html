			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dominique Hines, Daily Mail (London), July 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former football manager and pundit Ron Atkinson fell out with black athlete Tessa Sanderson during the week he spent living with her for Celebrity Wife Swap.</p>
<p>Big Ron, as the ex-Manchester United boss is known, is still aiming to rehabilitate his reputation after being forced to leave ITV after making racist comments in 2004.</p>
<p>And in a special of the Channel 4 show designed to create maximum tension, he has to share his home with the Olympic gold medallist javelin thrower.</p>
<p>Ron Atkinson, who was embroiled in a race row, lived with black athlete Tessa Sanderson for Channel 4&rsquo;s Celebrity Wife Swap show</p>
<p>When a frustrated Tessa presses him about why he made such comments, he bursts out defiantly, telling her that chapter of his life is closed and he won&rsquo;t apologise any more.</p>
<p>A show source told Mail Online: &#8216;Ron and Tessa fall out over the comments Ron made all those years ago.</p>
<p>&#8216;He says he doesn&rsquo;t want to be remembered for that comment, but for all the good things he has done for British football.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ron&rsquo;s wife Maggie and Tessa&rsquo;s partner Densign White, a former judo champion, also shared a home for seven days.</p>
<p>On the Channel 4 show, to be aired in late August, Tessa had to live by Mrs Atkinson&rsquo;s rules for the first half of the week, then took charge in the later half.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the show however, Ron does in fact let Tessa know how sorry he is.</p>
<p>Ron, 70, has been plagued by claims he is a racist since he branded Chelsea star Marcel Desailly a &#8216;lazy, thick n*****&rsquo; on live TV in 2004  &mdash;  thinking his microphone was turned off.</p>
<p>At the time he apologised: &#8216;I made a stupid mistake, which I regret. I can&rsquo;t believe I did it. It was just a moment of stupidity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he resigned from his £200,000 a year job.</p>
<p>Atkinson enjoyed a long career as a player, beginning at Aston Villa in 1956 and also playing at Oxford United, before going on to manage West Bromwich Albion, Man Utd  &mdash;  with whom he twice won the FA Cup  &mdash;  and Atletico Madrid.</p>
<p>He also commentated on five World Cup tournaments.</p>
<p>Ron later took part in a BBC show called Big Ron: Am I Racist? where he travelled the country claiming to be on a mission to work out why he made the remark.</p>
<p>Tessa, 53, was also herself at the centre of a racism row involving commentator Jim Rosenthal just last year.</p>
<p>ITV4 viewers had seen a short film about her charity work, when the veteran broadcaster commented: &#8216;Tessa Sanderson there, she was a great spear chucker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An embarrassed Rosenthal later apologised.</p>
<p>The channel said he had been referring to her achievements as a javelin thrower, in which she won gold in the 1984 Olympics.<br>

		<p>These &#8220;wife swap&#8221; shows are for the voyueristic and they are ridiculous.  I have seen parts of a couple of them, dumb, dumb, dumb, but with cheap production values, so they go on.</p>

While I know many people deride reality shows as contrived (and many are), those that allow participants to speak their minds can be revealing.</p>
<p>Mr. Atkinson clearly has a personal dislike for non-whites. Why he allowed himself to participate in this one is perplexing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, honesty is no longer a virtue. Lying to yourself and others for the sake of alleged racial harmony is.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;ve still got any skin on your knees, then you&rsquo;ve still got some apologizing to do.  Don&rsquo;t you know that yet, Mr Atkinson?</p>

		<p>Celebrity Wife Swap?    What the heck is that!???</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Ron&rsquo;s wife Maggie and Tessa&rsquo;s partner Densign White, a former judo champion, also shared a home for seven days.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Sounds like British TV is even sicker than American. <br>
Is there no end to how far they&rsquo;ll go to find gimmicks to draw an audience? </p>

		<p>I almost threw out my TV when I heard about the show Wife Swap. I&rsquo;ve watched a few episodes of the American one, and to my surprise it&rsquo;s one of the best shows on television. A bit boring for me so I don&rsquo;t watch it all the time. It seems to be quite a bit &#8216;staged&rsquo; sometimes too. No doubt the people are real but they put on a good show. </p>

		<p>So a TV commentator tried to praise a black javelin thrower and accidentally called her &#8220;a great spear chucker&#8221;?</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s funny.</p>

It is pure ignorance and stupidity to use these words. It is an admission of incompetence.</p>
<p>These people reveal a large part of themselves, whether the microphone is on or not. </p>
<p>There are certainly plenty of other words available. </p>

Sick indeed.   <br>
But   &mdash;    let someone like Sarah Kennedy make a very slight, complimentary comment about someone like Enoch Powell, and suddenly the broadcasters will draw themselves up and roundly condemn her with all their indignant moral outrage.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkinson clearly has a personal dislike for non-whites. Why he allowed himself to participate in this one is perplexing.&#8221;</p>
<p>My guess is that he has bought into the idea that he needs some public purging such as in times past in English society when you would spend some time in stocks to pay for a &#8220;sin.&#8221;  I also think that he imagines that he could improve his image through this, but he could not -at least in the way I think he imagined he could when the Black woman confronted him.  He didn&rsquo;t see that it would be a no win for him.  </p>
<p>I would like to see some public figure who makes a &#8220;slip&#8221; say, &#8220;I said it and that&rsquo;s how I feel about it. Now, what are you going to do about it?&#8221;  They get punished anyway, so they might as well go down with integrity.  At least that has a chance of inspiring other true British to speak their minds and begin to take their Island back from their traitorous government.<br>
