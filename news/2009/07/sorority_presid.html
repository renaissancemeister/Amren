<h1>Sorority President Sued Over $900,000 Statue</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WBBM-AM (Chicago), July 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eight members of the Chicago-based black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha have filed a lawsuit against the group&rsquo;s national president, looking to have her removed.</p>
<p>Sorority members accuse Barbara McKinzie of spending $900,000 on a wax statue of herself, spending about $400,000 on personal expenses and setting up a $4,000-a-month pension for four years. Also named in the lawsuit filed last month in Washington, D.C., Superior Court are Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. and former board members.</p>
<p>McKinzie has said she didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong and that the accusations are based on lies. She says the sorority board approved the $900,000 to pay for 2010 convention expenses. McKinzie says her wax statue will be on display along with statues of other important sorority figures.</p>
<p>The suit says McKinzie used the group&rsquo;s credit card to buy designer clothing, lingerie, jewelry and other personal items.</p>
<p>For her part, McKinzie says,  {snip}</p>
<p>And the statue, she says, didn&rsquo;t cost anything close to $900,000.</p>
<p>The Chicago Sun-Times reports the wax figure is being prepped at the National Great Blacks in Wax Museum in Baltimore for the museum&rsquo;s exhibit of predominantly black fraternity and sorority representatives.</p>

		<p>She had every right to spend that money on herself.  BLACKs can now do anything they want to now that Obama is in charge.  She should use more of their money for her own use.  Who the hell are they to tell this admired BLACK women what to do.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute!  I think I found a new business idea.  How about creating statues of self-important people&hellip;  I think I could do it for half of what they paid for this one and STILL manage to come out with a profit.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the good news: she&rsquo;s being called on the carpet for only one reason, black women are the ones paying for this from their sorority dues&hellip;not taxpayers. If taxpayers were paying for this statue, it would NOT be in the news. Why? Whitey is supposed to shut up and pay so no news coverage is needed when tax dollars are wasted.</p>

Indeed, it is the same with blacks in any postion of power I guess, once you get in steal, pilfer and embezzle to the utmost, and fight tooth and nail to stay in power.</p>
<p>Personally, however, I am  more disturbed by her spending sorority funds on lingerie then on a wax statute. Nasty.</p>

		<p>Blacks tend to go on huge power trips no what their true position in life.  I live in a small, mostly white community in SW Washington State.  There is a local black doctor who runs a child&rsquo;s clinic and who has a very loyal local following, and he constantly uses that to push his opinions, weigh in on civil cases involving his patients, and just generally place himself in a dominent role.  He&rsquo;s physically large, and he uses that to intimidate people who don&rsquo;t agree with him.  He hasn&rsquo;t commissioned a statue in his image to put on the front lawn of his clinic, but it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me.</p>
