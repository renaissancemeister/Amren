<h1>Akron Attack Victims Frustrated With Police Response</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phil Trexler, Akron Beacon Journal, July 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>All John Alchier could do was sit and pray.</p>
<p>His call to 911 was put on hold, he said, as he sat in his wheelchair and watched a group of teens pummel his brother and friend.</p>
<p>Alchier, 40, had a front-row seat as the teens swarmed a family gathering on Girard Street following the June 27 fireworks show at Firestone Park. Helplessness overtook him as he prayed out loud.</p>
<p>Community leaders are now voicing disgust over the attack, which is an example of the city&rsquo;s ballooning assault rate.</p>
<p>In police District 6, which includes Firestone Park, reports show that aggravated assaults have more than doubled this year compared with 2008.</p>
<p>The increase in aggravated assaults is even more dramatic in other areas of the city.</p>
<p>What happened on Girard Street is also a symbol of Akron&rsquo;s hushed racial tension. The victims are white; their attackers are black.</p>
<p>The attack has ignited scores of reaction, including a call for justice for the victims by the Rev. Al Sharpton.</p>
<p>From his view, Alchier said there&rsquo;s more to the story than has been told.</p>
<p>&#8220;The newspapers and the news is not telling the entire story. No one is,&#8221; Alchier said from his home in Akron.</p>
<p>Those who witnessed the assault or survived it say this was no isolated incident, and the beatings to Greg Alchier and his friend, Marty Marshall, extended farther than Girard Street that night. A third victim is identified in a police report. More are believed to have been treated for injuries.</p>
<p>&#8220;This happens every year; it just depends on which street they decide to go up,&#8221; said Greg Alchier, 39, who has attended the neighborhood fireworks show for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s always a bunch of kids trying to start fights with people. It happens every year, and nothing&rsquo;s ever done about it. It&rsquo;s just swept under the rug.&#8221;</p>
<p>Case in point, he said: Emergency room personnel at Akron General Medical Center told him that as many as 10 other people were treated for injuries that night after being attacked by a group of teens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the assault, John Alchier said, he was placed on hold when he called 911 for police. He has filed a complaint about the call with the department, which said it was investigating.</p>
<p>Although police say they are investigating the attack, Alchier said last week that no detective has sought his interview.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Attack recalled</b></p>
<p>John Alchier&rsquo;s account of the night matches the recollection of his brother and Marshall, who first spoke of the attack earlier this month.</p>
<p>The families were outside a Girard Street home after walking from the fireworks show, a decades-old annual event that typically draws as many as 10,000 people to the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Greg Alchier, who lives in Michigan, was visiting his family&rsquo;s home. Marty Marshall, 39, his wife, Yvonne, and their two children were there as well, about 30 minutes after the last fireworks blast. All were outside when a group of teens crowded the street that leads away from Firestone Park.</p>
<p>The group of about 30 to 40 teens was in the road, blocking a car.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One teen ran up from behind Greg Alchier, cutting through the yard, and blindsided him with a blow to the head.</p>
<p>There was no exchange of words leading up to the attack, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I turned around and said, &#8216;What the [expletive],&#8221; Greg Alchier said. &#8220;The next thing I know, one kids yells, &#8216;Oh, you want to fight?&rsquo; and then there&rsquo;s 15 to 20 of them running at us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greg Alchier recalls someone from the group of black teens yelling: &#8220;This is our world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marshall has said he also heard a teen saying: &#8220;This is a black world.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the group continued to fight Alchier, Marshall jumped in and both men found themselves attacked by a growing number of teens.</p>
<p>Marshall was beaten as he fell to the ground. Greg Alchier fended off teens, trying to help his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marty&rsquo;s fighting a group of kids. I&rsquo;m fighting a group of kids, and these kids are just running back and forth between us,&#8221; Greg Alchier said.</p>
<p>John Alchier said he was frustrated that an injury barred him from helping his brother. He has been paralyzed below the waist since a motorcycle crash 11 years ago.</p>
<p>All he could do, he said, was pray to Jesus for the attack to stop as he was calling 911.</p>
<p>&#8220;[911] immediately went to hold and said all &#8216;operators are busy,&rsquo;&#8221; Alchier said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m, like, thinking, are you kidding me? I&rsquo;m watching Marty on the ground just getting completely kicked.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was just a big crowd around him and a big crowd around my brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t do anything and I just yelled out, &#8216;Help us, Jesus&rsquo; and when I did that, they all just kind of went away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marshall suffered a concussion and spent five days in the hospital.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As paramedics arrived, a third injured man, a bleeding 23-year-old from Akron, came to the Girard Street house seeking treatment. He said the same group had assaulted him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John Alchier said an officer told him that a group of teens was stopped immediately after the attack, but the victims and witnesses were not allowed to see the boys to identify them as the attackers.</p>
<p>He said he could have identified only one of the teens by his clothing, a red jerseylike shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s the thing that bothering me: no arrests,&#8221; John Alchier said. &#8220;They kept continually asking us if we could identify any of them. And all they would let us give them were descriptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;They would not let anybody go down and ID anybody. And they said they weren&rsquo;t going to bring anybody here to ID them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just one description of a suspect has been released. He is a black male, 17 to 19 years old, wearing braids or dreadlocks with red and white beads. He also had braces on his teeth.</p>
<p><b>Urgency questioned </b></p>
<p>As for the race issue, Marshall and the Alchier brothers can&rsquo;t say whether their gathering was targeted because they are white.</p>
<p>They remain frustrated by the apparent lack of urgency and attention their case has received from police.</p>
<p>The incident was not reported by police to the media until almost two weeks had passed.</p>
<p>Akron police said the department&rsquo;s public information officer was on vacation at that time and his replacement did not issue a release.</p>
<p>Mayor Don Plusquellic sought the FBI&rsquo;s help July 10.</p>
<p>Agent Scott Wilson, a Cleveland-based FBI spokesman, said the agency has begun an inquiry in conjunction with Akron police to determine if the case falls under federal hate crime statutes.</p>
<p>Police have not classified the assaults as hate crimes. Officials said they were unaware of the chants, &#8220;This is our world&#8221; or &#8220;This is a black world&#8221; until the victims and witnesses spoke to the media.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Councilwoman responds</b></p>
<p>Councilwoman Tina Merlitti said she&rsquo;s disturbed by the Girard Street attack, calling it &#8220;horrible&#8221; and &#8220;scary&#8221; for the victims. She said, however, that the assault appears to be an isolated incident involving teens who might not live in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Merlitti said part of the reason she believes her ward is safe is through the efforts of residents working with police and city schools.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Merlitti ordered the removal of basketball hoops from Firestone Park because of growing numbers of youths fighting, playing loud music or nighttime basketball games.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Akron police said there have been 41 aggravated assaults and 108 criminal acts of intimidation in the first five months of this year in the police district that includes Firestone Park. For the same period last year, there were 18 assaults and 89 acts of intimidation, police records show.</p>
<p>Overall, crime is down in the district by 14 percent this year.</p>

		<p>The media and Obama are too busy worrying about Gates having his ego bruised.  It is sad that Obama instantly knows about the Gates affair, but has (or pretends to have) no knowledge of the disproportionate high crime and assaults by blacks against whites.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind Akron is a city with a lengthy, generational, history of interracial relationships. The black man/white women only variety. While there isn&rsquo;t a huge white underclass in Akron, it is there (of course the school system and media must constantly tell this underclass how privileged they are) this is likely to blow up in the future (41 assaults and 108 criminal acts of intimidation in Firestone Park alone a tiny neighborhood) until a black person gets killed Bernard Goetz style, or dragging death style, or just some plain ole racial hate. Then the police, media, and government and even Al Sharpton will be concerned about it for real and it will be labeled a racial incident or &#8216;hate crime&rsquo;, reported on and as a symptom of white racism, prejudice and hate. It&rsquo;s the only thing the authorities are truly afraid of, Unhappy black people. They have no reason to be afraid of anything else. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s open season to intimidate, assault and kill whites in Akron, Ohio.</p>

		<p>During the war I lived in Akron. At the time, the cops would have had little trouble with hostile belligerent &#8220;Blacks&#8221; because they had little fear of FDR vilifying them should one of them turn out to be a friend of his who wanted to bait cops.</p>
<p>After later moving to Long Beach Ca., I was set upon by a &#8220;Black&#8221; wilding crew, who - after stabbing me - amused themselves by gathering around kicking me nearly unto death. The same evening, the crew also taught several other White people in the vicinity what diversity is really all about.</p>
<p>The local newspapers reported that &#8220;fun&#8221; event for what it was. Its unlikely any news medium would do so today, in this more enlightened &#8220;socially sensitive&#8221; age.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s incidents like this and the above articles involving Gates and the officer that have me convinced that black and whites will never get along with one another.  Blacks as a group have a different view of the world and reality.  White thinking: logic and reason.  Black thinking: emotion.  To try and force the races together and have them peacefully get along is pure fantasy and foolishness.  It has never worked before, why would it work now.</p>

		<p>I try to feel bad for these people I really do, but if attacks on whites by blacks are an annual occurence, then perhaps it&rsquo;s time to start carrying guns.  Something like that would never happen where I live.  We have three guns in our house of two people, and have no problem with using them.  As my father was so fond of saying &#8220;When it comes to home invasions, it&rsquo;s your word against that of a corpse, which isn&rsquo;t likely to disagree.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, with firearms you only have to stop an attack from occuring once.  If you do it right, there won&rsquo;t be any of them left to attack you again next year.  Oh, and what jury in their right mind would convict a man for defending himselves against thirty screaming teenagers (aside from a black one, of course)?</p>

		<p>How can the FBI be looking into Hate Crime law violations when Congress has yet to pass a hate crime law. Some states have these hate crime laws. But the FBI is a federal employee, not Ohio. </p>
<p>Perhaps he&rsquo;s looking into whethe civil rights were violated, though Eric Holder, the agent&rsquo;s ultimate boss would be reluctant, I think, to bring civil rights violations against black &#8220;youth&#8221; (they are always &#8220;youth&#8221;, whereas young whites are kids, teenagers, skinheads, etc.)</p>

		<p>I hope I live long enough to see whites wake up and say, &#8220;Okay, that&rsquo;s it. No more mister nice guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites are just so intent on being NICE, NICE, NICE, NICE&hellip;.you see it in the quotes in this and other articles.</p>
<p>Some of them have to be hip to some degree about what&rsquo;s going on (I think most aren&rsquo;t), but are just afraid.</p>

		<p>The television news shows are all reporting on this AA professor Gates who was shrieking like a woman, because a cop dared to question why he was trying to break into a house, which turned out to be his own.</p>
<p>Video excerpts of him talking to a large crowd of blacks whining vociferously that what happened to him is what happens constantly to blacks in America was shown as snippets on a couple of talk shows.  He was inciting the black audience.  </p>
<p>This kind of anti-white, anti-US hatred is what incites these blacks to commit mob attacks against whites, like the incident reported in this news report above.  They&rsquo;re lied to repeatedly, but I think they like it.  It gives them an excuse to release their pent up rage at being unable to compete on their own in this country.  THe media encourages them even more than their so-called leaders by assuring them their failures are whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>Now, with the messiah weighing in on the side of the effeminate black, the case is firmly established as a white on black racist incident, when, in actual fact, the girly black brought the situation to a fever pitch all because of his misbehavior and his obvious hatred of whites and the white establishment.  He was correctly arrested for disorderly conduct.  Having the usual black arrogance and feeling of importance, he became unhinged and seems to get worse every day.</p>
<p>Those whites who have led protected lives and those who don&rsquo;t want to create waves, but know the score, are slowly getting a view of unjust cries of racism and they&rsquo;re hearing frequently about how racist they are when 99% of them have probably supported blacks in some way or another most of their lives. And that&rsquo;s bad news for blacks in general.  </p>
<p>For that, I guess a debt of gratitude is owed Obama.  If he  had never been elected so many racial topics would never have been brought to their attention, so the whites who were glad to see Obama get in, because of just this situation, are proving they were right in their assessment of how helpful he was going to be in awakening sleeping whites about how blacks truly feel and how racist they are compared to whites.</p>
<p>Black collective arrogance is making them feel like the blacks in this story:  This is a black world.  They own it.  One of their own Bros is pres.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to behave even worse in the days ahead.</p>

		<p>In all fairness to the police, this is a direct consequence of years of suing cops for &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; and similar thought crimes.  Policemen know that if they are tough on black criminals the likely reward is a lawsuit followed by loss of their jobs.<br>

<p>What language do the &#8220;officials&#8221; speak that caused the victims to not be understood???????  Are we to believe that the victims didn&rsquo;t report the racist chants to the police?  That they nor the witnesses never mentioned the verbal assaults when giving statements to the police?  That not a single witness mentioned the verbal abuse until after the press showed up?  Are the officials lying sacks of&hellip;&hellip;..?</p>

		<p>The sport of black youth mobs having fun going around attacking any people of light they can find is quite common, and ignored by the national media: Such as the Newport Beach CA Halloween black youth mob attack on those white girls as the black youths chanted &#8220;F*** whites&#8221;. Such as the black youth mob beatings of whites after the Saint Patrick Day parade year before last, including the vicious beating of a white father, mother, and their daughter.</p>

		<p>Sooner rather than later, like the Rev. Manning says (he&rsquo;s black) the white man is going to get tired of being beaten, robbed, murdered and White women raped, and it is going to be ugly. See videos of this man on youtube, very enlightening.</p>

		<p>There is a story - probably untrue - but so apropo I recount it here without comment. During the depression there were a lot of unemployed rubber workers in Akron, many of them newly arrived from the Appalachian Mountain portions of West Virginia and Kentucky.</p>
<p>When hard times arrived, those fellows were hit hard. Their efforts to unionize came to nothing, and one encounter between union men and police was especially brutal.</p>
<p>After that day the strikers drew back and calmed down. Following a period of silence they made another attempt to rally support among the unemployed by sponsoring a turkey shoot.</p>
<p>On the day of the shoot, several thousand men walked the main streets of Akron to the place the event was to be held. All of them carried shotguns or rifles. They were quiet, there was no noise or trouble of any kind, but their point had been made.</p>
<p>They declared they werebno longer inclined to be smacked around free of charge. Locals witnessed the parade and adjusted their behavior accordingly.</p>
<p>This story, as I have recounted it, appears in John Stienbeck&rsquo;s The Grapes of Wrath.</p>

<p>Even worse, the left actually enjoys the fact that the underclass is rising up against their slavemasters and assaulting them, robbing them, and killing them.<br>

		<p>Every time blacks look at whites it reminds them of how physically unattractive Africans are and how inferior their race is.  This creates jealousy and jealousy fuels their hatred of whites and nothing will ever change this reality.  Blacks will never feel at home outside of their own black nations.</p>
<p>The last thing whites need is more articles reminding us how much blacks hate whites.  What we need are more articles that address the unpleasant necessity of returning blacks to the lands from whence they came.  Failure to do so will certainly lead to a race war, because blacks will never be compatible in white societies&hellip;<br>

		<p>comment by Anonymous #22 needs to be briefly addressed. It would be great if blacks were relocated to Africa. but they are not that dumb. No one except one or two &#8216;intellectuals&rsquo; in black studies might go to Ghana or Nigeria. </p>
<p>The solution is much more bloody if you want a solution. Slavery is absurd; just another welfare plan. What can happen is what should have happened in South Africa: Partition of the nation. Some parts are all white; some all black. There are not that many blacks so they don&rsquo;t get much. Maybe parts of the Old South. They leave the North or else. </p>
<p>As for the &#8220;Latinos&#8221; those who are legal and are white, and there are many, they can stay in white areas if they speak English and don&rsquo;t need &#8220;remedial&#8221; education.</p>
<p> Illegals out totally. Brown legals can burrow into parts of the Southwest which they can have(not the Grand Canyon Amigo). Get out of Chicago and New York. Screw the restaurant owners who &#8220;need&#8221; latinos of color to wait tables. We would rather live without fancy restauarants than to continue this racial hell.</p>
<p>A new constitution is needed or you can&rsquo;t do anything to beneifit the white race. Think about it. Be prepared as our ancestors were to fight for it. The blacks, latinos, and liberal lawyers aren&rsquo;t going to voluntarily agree to a new race based constitution without a 14, 15th Amendment. </p>
<p>As for DC, make it a national park and move the Capitol to Des Moines. The black inhabitants move to their new homes in Mississippi.</p>

<p>We already have a race based constitution they seem perfectly happy with. Why not? It favors their race. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Such as the Newport Beach CA Halloween black youth mob attack on those white girls as the black youths chanted &#8216;F*** whites&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>FYI:</p>
<p>This incident took place in Long Beach, not Newport Beach, two very different communities.</p>
<p>Demographics of Long Beach:</p>
<p>Hispanic/Latino: 	45.7%<br>
White*: 	14.8%<br>
Black*: 	23.4%</p>
<p>Demographics of Newport Beach:</p>
<p>Hispanic/Latino: 	5.3%<br>
White*: 	90.9%<br>
Black*: 	0.6%</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s infuriating about this case is that the criminals were remanded to attend &#8216;sensitivity training&rsquo;  and a &#8216;racial tolerance&rsquo; program at the Simon Weisenthal Center&rsquo;s Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>How about a &#8216;racial sensitivity&rsquo; program designed and taught by Whites?</p>

		<p><i>What happened on Girard Street is also a symbol of Akron&rsquo;s hushed racial tension. The victims are white; their attackers are black.</i></p>
<p><b>Finally!</b> More journos are finally seeing the elephant in the bathtub   &mdash;   and admitting it.  This runs contrary to years of training that teaches them to worship anti-racist dogma instead of the truth. <br>

		<p>I still can&rsquo;t get over what a bad PR move it was for one of the punks to have shouted out &#8220;This is a black world&#8221;, before the black dogpack proceeded to demonstrate just how such a world would look.</p>

<p>I hope I live long enough to see whites wake up and say, &ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s it. No more mister nice guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whites are just so intent on being NICE, NICE, NICE, NICE&hellip;.you see it in the quotes in this and other articles.</p>
<p>Some of them have to be hip to some degree about what&rsquo;s going on (I think most aren&rsquo;t), but are just afraid.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  - Maybe you&rsquo;ll be even luckier and get in a few licks yourself.  Oh boy wouldn&rsquo;t we all love that.  Wouldn&rsquo;t we all.</p>
