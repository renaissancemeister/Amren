<h1>Report: City Unemployment Gap Widening Among Blacks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NY1 News, July 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new report released Monday by City Comptroller Bill Thompson predicts about 400,000 New Yorkers will be out of work by next year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the largest number in more than 15 years.</p>
<p>Thompson says by 2010 the unemployment rate will likely be 9.5 percent. He also says African-Americans will be among the groups hardest hit, having already seen the unemployment rate grow four times faster than other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The report by the Comptroller&rsquo;s Office about how blacks or African-Americans have lost jobs at 14.7 percent higher rate than whites in the city is indicative of the racial imbalance in the economic down curve that is happening all over the country,&#8221; Sharpton said.</p>

		<p>The New York Times covered this story, and it accidentally told the truth on why black unemployment relative to whites is increasing in NYC faster than anywhere else   &mdash;   the local governments are hurting for revenue, and are therefore laying off workers (disproportionately black) off.  Ditto with the area Post Offices.</p>

<p>Somebody please tell this black, racist white-hater that it is Hispanics taking black jobs, not whites.</p>
<p>Of course, he knows that, but he is terrified to include Hispanics in his criticizations, because he needs them to include in the umbrella he has created.  If he ever gets to the point he can do without them, they will be demonized just as whites have been for so many years.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I&rsquo;d like to point out that the unemployment rate in NY is almost 5% higher than is being reported.</p>
<p>I wish more people on this site would do as I do.  Whenever the media, a self-hating white radical, or a corrupt demagogue like this Sharpton relates stats comparable only to whites, I write the news souce asking why blacks are never compared to HIspanics, since there are at a minimum 45 million of them in this country right now.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a black/white achievement gap or a jobs gap, it&rsquo;s always cited as blacks and whites.</p>
<p>Please understand the importance of pressuring these news sources to make comparisons to blacks that are more appropriate.  It will go a long way to shifting the fight to blacks and Hispanics.  That&rsquo;s where it should be anyway.  Whites aren&rsquo;t comparable to blacks in any way, from I.Q. scores to jobs, to academic achievement, but they ARE comparable to Hispanics.</p>

		<p>Hmm&hellip;</p>
<p>I live in a majority black county and, from what I can tell, whites have been the hardest hit. Blacks have not only been able to keep their jobs, but have no problem getting hired because any of the black managers will hire a black right off the street, no questions asked. Whites are just turned around at the door. </p>
<p>I believe the reason blacks are the hardest hit elsewhere is that they make up a large portion of the service/manufacturing industry in the lower end of the hierarchy due to being unskilled, uneducated or both. Effectually, this is the fault of not only years of outsourcing but the fault of their Lord Messiah himself. </p>
<p>Alas, this &#8220;catastrophe&#8221; involves the word &#8220;black&#8221; so that&rsquo;s all Sharpton cares about. I will make it a point to call him up about whites being laid off/fired at a disproportionate rate around here, though, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll get right on it&hellip;</p>

		<p>When my company hires we have all applicants write a paragraph stating why they want to work for us.  The blacks, for the most part, can not put together an essay as well as most ESL applicants.<br>

		<p>How about headlines &#8220;unemployment up, males hardest hit&#8221; because that&rsquo;s the truth. OH, but males are not a member of any whining victim group, so the media doesn&rsquo;t give them any sympathy.</p>

		<p>What Sharpie Al fails to acknowledge&hellip; that under-educated, unskilled Blacks will automatically be the first to go in the low-end labor market. Particularly so, given that most employers will rather hire illegal Mexican immigrants instead of Blacks. Since the perception is that the illegal immigrants at least are better workers than Blacks. </p>
<p>Sharpton, like many of his peers, is a living demonstration that the Bell Curve theory works quite well.</p>

<p>Because Whites cannot fight back, and $harpton knows it.  Whites are hanging on by a 5-4 thin edge as it is and when that changes, the very few &#8216;rights&rsquo; Whites are afforded will end.  $harpton knows the anti-White justice department, msm mouthpieces, academia  &mdash;  hell, the entire government  &mdash;   are in his pocket.</p>
<p>If he were to go after the hispanic community, they will immediately trot out their own grievance industry  &mdash;  LuLAC, MalDEF, La Raza, et al., and let&rsquo;s hope they do.  They might be inclined to publicize black crime rates and black rates of incarceration.</p>
<p>Imagine, two low IQd &#8216;White man done me wrong&rsquo; groups going at it. </p>
<p>Yeah, let it be so.</p>
