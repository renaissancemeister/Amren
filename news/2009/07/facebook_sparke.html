<h1><a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,,25723022-2,00.html">Facebook &#8216;Sparked White Flight From MySpace&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News Digital Media (Sydney), July 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A &#8220;WHITE flight&#8221; to Facebook has turned MySpace into a black ghetto, according to a social analyst in the US.</p>
<p>Danah Boyd said Facebook&rsquo;s arrival sparked a migration from MySpace of white users, the educated and the wealthy, while non-whites had stuck together on MySpace.</p>
<p>MySpace is owned by News Corp, the parent company of the publisher of NEWS.com.au.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&rsquo;t just anyone who left MySpace to go to Facebook,&#8221; Ms Boyd, who works with Microsoft Research New England, told a crowd at New York&rsquo;s Democracy Forum.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might as well face an uncomfortable reality .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what happened was modern day &#8216;white flight&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Boyd said MySpace had become a digital &#8220;ghetto&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people there are more likely to be brown or black and to have a set of values that terrifies white society,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Her interviews with American teenagers since 2006 showed that online migration mimicked the patterns of class groups&rsquo; movements across cities.</p>
<p>She found teens who preferred Facebook were far more likely to talk down to those who use MySpace than vice versa.</p>
<p>Ms Boyd said her research showed high school students found Facebook &#8220;more cultured&#8221; and &#8220;less cheesy&#8221; than MySpace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any high school student who has a Facebook page will tell you MySpace users are more likely to be barely educated and obnoxious,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Ms Boyd also warned that the class divisions on social sites will harden over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their decision to (move to Facebook) was wrapped up in their connections to others, in their belief that a more peaceful, quiet, less-public space would be more idyllic.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Question for ARers:  What will become of Twitter?  I get the sense, based on its design of instant communication, called microblogging, that Twitter is going to become more and more black over time.  For much the same reason why many blacks, esp. girls and women, are always gabbing on their phones.  The one thing that might preclude that is the 140-character limit, which will favor mainly whites that use language efficiently.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a little more complicated than that.  Facebook is for the frat boy/sorority girl types and myspace is for everyone else, which includes working class white people, people with an artistic bent, counter culture people, rural people, military people etc.  </p>

		<p>I have never had a myspace account to begin with.  However, both myspace and facebook are free for anyone to sign up and create an account under.  I log onto my facebook account everyday.  There were times when it felt like the whole world was addicted to facebook.  Sometimes, when I went to the library at school, everyone was viewing their facebook account on their computer.  Facebook makes it so easy to throw parties and know who is coming and not coming to the parties.  I did read facebook has the more clear layout in the past&hellip; I did look at others&rsquo; myspace accounts in the past.  facebook and AmRen&hellip; two among the Korean guy&rsquo;s favourite websites.  </p>

<p>This is satire, right? A &#8220;peaceful, quiet, less-public space&#8221;&hellip;on the Internet!?! There is virtually NO DIFFERENCE between MySpace and Facebook. Facebook is not quieter or any safer or farther away from non-whites. This is probably the most retarded article I&rsquo;ve seen in a while. This blatant attempt to paint white people as racist over the free, available to everyone, social networking site they use, is sick. Hopefully the author had the good sense to use a pseudonym when writing this trash.   </p>

		<p>Myspace shot themselves in the foot. I used to use Myspace to promote my rock band.About a year and a half ago, all they advertised and promoted was black entertainers. It became an online version of BET. What did they expect? Guess what? Not everybody outside L.A. Is so slavish about black entertainer. I also got sick of the Interracial Dating popup ads and split for Facebook.  </p>

		<p>A flight of the &#8220;educated&#8221;?  Is that a code word for &#8220;intelligent&#8221;?  After all, Facebook and MySpace users are mostly high schoolers, aren&rsquo;t they?  In the same grades?  Is the writer suggesting that white high-schoolers have actually received an education, vs. brown and black peers in the same grades??</p>

		<p> I don&rsquo;t patronize either Facebook or MySpace. But if you go on a heavily-used website where comments can be posted, like YouTube, you&rsquo;ll soon see how vile, ignorant and threatening a lot of the comments can be.</p>
<p> Does that mean that all such comments come from non-Whites? Of course not. But the more people that patronize a blog, the lower the common denominator of education, intelligence, etc., is bound to be. Given the fact that blacks, for example, test a full 15 IQ points lower in this country, on average, than Whites, then draw your own conclusions. </p>

		<p>So true, but there&rsquo;s no need to be shocked. Facebook originally started as a social networking site for college students. A user had to have a valid .edu email to open a profile. As more whites have such an email, Facebook became known for being white. I still have a My Space account, though it sees almost no use. Almost all my friends moved to Facebook, so I did too. I like the frequent updates, quizes, and groups to join. I *don&rsquo;t* miss ads for &#8220;My Space Latina&#8221; and &#8220;Interracial Couples&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll post a link to the original article on my Facebook.</p>

		<p>I have a Facebook account, but wouldn&rsquo;t touch MySpace with a ten foot pole. One of the most annoying thing about MySpace profiles is that often you get loud music blaring when you visit a given person&rsquo;s page, among other annoying things which you won&rsquo;t see on a Facebook profile.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right about that, sbuffalonative. I clicked the link you posted and right there on the first page, I was greeted with thumbnail member pictures featuring no less than five shirtless black males in sagging jeans throwing gang signs, and four porcine females &#8220;seductively&#8221; flashing cleavage. The fifth young Nubian queen, a paragon of grace, was shooting the bird in at the lens in her photo, which was taken in the exotic locale of her own bathroom.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I didn&rsquo;t explore this site any further. If I was so inclined, I can easily see these types in the flesh causing chaos at the local mall or movie theater on a Friday night.</p>

		<p>My space runs a political ad that shows Obama and Hillary together. Obama behind Hillary. It looks like they are having sex. There&rsquo;s no other explanation for the photo being arranged the way it is. Admittedly the Ad is for The Onion humor site, but it ran for quite awhile and on separate occasions on Myspace. If you didn&rsquo;t look closer at the Ad you&rsquo;d assume the photo was sponsored by Myspace. Frankly, I figured some kind of conservative was behind Myspace. The problem with Myspace is that it&rsquo;s so terribly slow nowadays.  </p>
<p>What I want to know is, where did Twitter come from? One day I&rsquo;d never heard of it. The next day, bam, celebrities left and right, and even the local news casters are talking about it their stories.</p>

		<p>And Bebo is for children and teenagers, lets not forget about that website.</p>
<p>&gt;Migration &hellip; Facebook users are reportedly white and wealthy<br>
&gt;while MySpace users are uneducated and obnoxious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about &#8216;white and wealthy&rsquo; but Facebook is a high brow place in comparison to MySpace. The politicians in my country think it&rsquo;s so good that all of them are on it, but none are on Bebo or MySpace.</p>
<p>The thing I like the most at Facebook (apart from the lack of bad music) is the background, which is white, which allows you to actually see the words! So many times I&rsquo;ve seen black backgrounds with dark writing and you have to move the writing in front of a light coloured picture to be able to read what someone has written. And then there&rsquo;s all the pictures people try to jam into their page that makes the page alignment go spastic so you have to scroll to the right to see what you want to find. It&rsquo;s such a stupid setup!</p>

		<p>A premise: I don&rsquo;t like Facebook&rsquo;s owner, I don&rsquo;t like the interface, I don&rsquo;t like its intent (which is not social networking; see this article: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/njl8jx)" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/njl8jx)</a> and I don&rsquo;t like the concept. That said, my observation is this: </p>
<p>I have noticed that most people&rsquo;s friends lists are remarkably racially homogeneous.  I have seen this for both blacks and whites.  This is a little surprising to me, as many facebook &#8220;friends&#8221; are not friends at all but may in fact be close to enemies in real life, and &#8220;friend&#8221; each other merely to make each other appear popular.  Since multiculturalism is still very much in vogue, it would follow that whites especially would feel compelled to &#8220;friend&#8221; as many non-white token friends as possible to appear inclusive and cool. From browsing people&rsquo;s friend lists, though, I haven&rsquo;t seen that happening to a great extent.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly; Twitter was just one of those things that lingered in obscurity, and something somewhere caused it to reach critical mass.  First I heard of it was the fall of last year during the election season, and the pols and candidates that use it.</p>
<p>I signed up yesterday, mainly because there is now a way to hook your blog&rsquo;s RSS feed to Twitter; I figure I could get a few more eyeballs for my blog.  I found out that some of the news sources that I read and do not push RSS feeds are on Twitter, so I now follow them and easily read their stories from Twitter; it has made my existence a little easier.</p>
<p>Since AR pushes an RSS feed, it too could be on Twitter.</p>

		<p>Facebook isn&rsquo;t making a profit, despite having more users than MySpace.  It will either have to sell more ads (like MySpace) or charge subscription fees in order to survive.  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind paying a fee if it meant no ads.  And they&rsquo;d have to provide good (American!) customer support.</p>
<p>MySpace stinks: atrocious customer support and bad layout coding.  But it is THE entertainment promo site.  I&rsquo;m a music fan, and that&rsquo;s where all the bands are, both established and up and coming.</p>

		<p>For background - I&rsquo;m a computer programmer who has tweeted only once on Twitter (but have friends who use it a lot), used to have a MySpace account, and currently has a Facebook profile. Here&rsquo;s my take:</p>
<p>MySpace sucks. Plain and simple. It allows users to play obnoxious music automatically on the page, which automatically turns off anyone surfing to it from work (you don&rsquo;t want music blaring from your cubicle, as it could get you fired or draw unwanted attention). Plus the pages take forever to load and have a junky layout, because it allows you to overload pages with far too much junk - pictures, obnoxious backgrounds, etc. Besides the racial angle, I think those are the main reasons people with any kind of brains stay away from it. Those reasons, by the way, drive away the more intelligent, the calmer, essentially the White and middle-aged users like myself.</p>
<p>Facebook, on the other hand, doesn&rsquo;t have all that junk (at least not that I&rsquo;ve noticed, but I&rsquo;ll admit I haven&rsquo;t explored it farther than setting up a profile or communicating with my family). I could safely hit it from work and not draw attention to myself, so I&rsquo;m more likely to stick with it.</p>
<p>Twitter? I don&rsquo;t use it, nor do I &#8220;follow&#8221; anyone on it, though I could if I wanted to (I prefer email newsletters and RSS feeds for the sites I&rsquo;m concerned about, which are few). However, I have a couple of programming buddies who use it a lot. They follow comments from Microsoft execs and other programming leaders. It&rsquo;s actually quite useful for sending links to articles of interest or short comments. However, I have far too much going on in my life between work, school, business, reading real life paper books (yes, they actually do still print those, surprising I know) to do much social networking, apart from keeping up with family who use that sort of thing.</p>
<p>As for my opinion on the article and the &#8220;White flight&#8221; - sure, it&rsquo;s probably happening. But not because of &#8220;racism&#8221; per se, it&rsquo;s to seek sanity. And we tend to find that sanity more on Facebook than MySpace. Same reason Whites live in the suburbs, not because of hatred of a person&rsquo;s skin color, it&rsquo;s to find peace, tranquility, and sanity.</p>

		<p>Facebook is a more interactive social network, based on intelligence, so it&rsquo;s only natural that people of intelligence would use Facebook.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used MySpace for quite a few years and have witnessed the slant toward blacks.  It&rsquo;s a great place for up and coming artists, but as a social network I find it severely lacking in interactivity.  I never could get into it.  Aside from the blog, I&rsquo;ve rarely used it over the years and my profile hasn&rsquo;t changed.  Some people spend hours in MySpace reading bulletins and posting comments.  It&rsquo;s just blah and lacking any stimulation.  Facebook doesn&rsquo;t have issues with fake accounts, spammers and scammers like MySpace does.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also used MyYearbook and I can tell you it&rsquo;s even worse than MySpace.  It&rsquo;s full of fake accounts and people just log on and post to make &#8220;Lunch Money&#8221; for their account.  The MyMag feature is riddled with kids discussing such subjects as homosexuality and cheating on your boyfriend.  It&rsquo;s pretty raw and it gives you a look into what the mentality of kids is nowadays.  I&rsquo;m taking white kids.  It&rsquo;s pretty scary stuff.</p>

		<p>I agree with some above posters about Myspace versus Facebook.  I quit my Myspace account recently because I, too, was tired of all the spam and ads plastered everywhere on there.  Facebook is kind of getting to be that way, but at least you can block who views your profile with facebook.</p>

<p>No. Anyone can join those websites so there can be no complaints of bias. </p>
<p>A lot of sites restrict racist comments and harsh language because the website wants to get a &#8220;family friendly&#8221; rating on search engines and avoid being blocked by corporate firewalls.</p>
<p>One subculture that has a surprising amount of &#8220;racially aware&#8221; primarily white individuals is gore related sites. Of course the material alone puts them out of the family friendly ratings group, so comments/language/opinions rarely censored, but I also suspect the fact the users watch lots and lots of REAL crime videos contributes to the awareness.</p>

		<p>I would love to see a study on whether or not the modern liberals, who celebrated the black and brown rappers, baby mamas, gangsters, etc&hellip; to My Space followed the normal educated white folk over to Facebook once it became dangerous and uncomfortable for them to remain. To see, in other words, if their &#8220;migration mimicked the patterns of class groups&rsquo; movements across cities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Has anybody noticed the excessive amount of coverage that Michael Jackson&rsquo;s death has been getting lately vs. Farrah Fawcett&rsquo;s!  Only in the Liberal Lame Stream Media could this ever happen in this once great country.  So long America: 1776 - 2009!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Facebook started as a service for COLLEGE STUDENTS to keep in touch. They also (used to) require that you use your full name so it was much more personal than myspace which lets you use names like babyphat550932. They let anyone join now and it has noticeably become much darker and full of people who &#8220;friend&#8221; you just because they think you&rsquo;re attractive not because you actually know each other. In other words, its becoming more like myspace. Instead of becoming an online network reflecting real social groups based around legitimate activity its becoming an orgy wannabe rappers and whores looking for an easy lay.</p>

		<p>Yes, I have noticed that Facebook is more White and has a more mature sophisticated image - which is why I got a Facebook account. But I think with all the media hype of Facebook in the last year, I&rsquo;ve noticed more black and Mestizo accounts being registered. However, unlike myspace, Facebook&rsquo;s user&rsquo;s friend list tend to be racially homogeneous. The thing with Facebook I don&rsquo;t like is the liberal slant. I constantly see pop-up ads for &#8216;Support Gay Adoption&rsquo;, and that nature. Liberal groups know that White youth are vulnerable to social engineering.</p>

		<p>I have no use for any of those sites. What a bunch of nonsense. If I want someone to know what I&rsquo;m doing or I want to know what they&rsquo;re doing I email or call them. There is extreme danger on the internet in being young and stupid. Or just gullible.</p>

		<p>People like being around their own. Blacks like being with their own, Hispanics with theirs, and whites with theirs. You can say it&rsquo;s economic reason or whatever, the reality is race. If whites woman leave to Myspace or vis versa, the white men are going to follow. T</p>
<p>he reality is whites and other races have different interest. Black interest is gangs, rap, and what have you. </p>
<p>Whites are not going to stay if a site becomes a mini BET, the only whites who stay are whites of immaturity who haven&rsquo;t grow up yet, but even when they get older they&rsquo;ll move along with the rest of their race.</p>
<p>This is a race issue you&rsquo;ll notice it on just about every site not just myspace. For example on Youtube most Hispanics stick together, just search &#8220;brown pride&#8221; or anything to do with &#8220;Hispanic gangs&#8221; culture, race, music, interest, and you will see all the Hispanics congregate together even on the internet. </p>
<p>There are videos that interest all raceson Youtube, which all races comment on, but just click on any of the users commenting. Most likely if that person is Hispanic most his friends, and favorites are to do with Hispanics. The same is also with other races Asians, Blacks, Arabs, and Whites.</p>

		<p>Interesting that people should comment on black internet behavior.  I made a few pretty innocuous comments on Youtube (statements of historical facts which apparently conflicted with their perceptions of history), after watching several videos on happenings in South Africa.  Responses to my comments, by blacks, amounted to assaults.  Honestly: it felt as if I were being physically assaulted (with intent to kill) just reading their words.  Those responses, more than any contact I&rsquo;ve had with blacks, and more than anything I&rsquo;ve read about their behavior, have made me terrified of them.  As terrifying as their viciousness, is the impossibility of reasoning with them.</p>
