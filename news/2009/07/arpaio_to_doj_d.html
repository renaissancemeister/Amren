<h1>Arpaio to DOJ: &#8216;Don&rsquo;t Pick on Me&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KPHO-TV (Phoenix), July 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office will not cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice in an ongoing investigation into whether the office uses racial profiling, Sheriff Joe Arpaio announced in a news conference Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The sheriff claims the DOJ is investigating his office for political reasons, not because of racial profiling; according to Arpaio, the Democrats in Washington don&rsquo;t agree with section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows local law enforcement agencies to assist with illegal immigration enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>{Snip}</p>
<p>The DOJ informed the sheriff&rsquo;s office in March that it was investigating. Since then, Arpaio said the agency has yet to cite any specific examples of racial profiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new attorney general has said that his top priority is to go after racial profiling,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t pick on me to show you&rsquo;re doing something. If you&rsquo;re going to do it, pick on someone that&rsquo;s guilty  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s a big difference here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arpaio said he&rsquo;ll fight the investigation, even if it means suing the federal government.<br>

		<p>If Sheriff Joe Arpaio says it, it&rsquo;s the unvarnished truth. </p>
<p>If the DOJ says anything regarding the open sore of illegal immigration, it comes from a long history of cynical lying, and deceitful policies and actions, and is entirely unworthy of even the slightist impulse of reliance.</p>

		<p>     Sheriff Joe, you are fighting a losing battle. First, the media will come after you with all they have. Then the (in)Justice Department will cook up some excuse for investigating every little thing you ever did. Did you pick your nose while in the third grade ? Finally the ACLU and SPLC will hit you with so many law suits that you&rsquo;ll go broke fighting them. Sound familiar ? Ask Sarah Palin.</p>

		<p>Sounds like the Federal government is racially profiling white law enforcement officers.  There are Hispanic sheriffs along the border here in Texas and some in New Mexico that have been cooperating with ICE.  There are the usual complaints from the ACLU and others about civil rights and immigrant rights, etc., but nothing about racial profiling.  Liberals hate men like Arpaio because he&rsquo;s white, he&rsquo;s tough, he&rsquo;s smart, and he&rsquo;s effective.  Lets not forget he&rsquo;s also elected, and if he weren&rsquo;t doing what his constituents wanted, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been re-elected all those times.  </p>

		<p>The DOJ is mostly concerned with crimes &#8220;Americans&#8221; might have  committed. Foreign nationals crimes doesn&rsquo;t much bother the DOJ.</p>

		<p>Now THIS guy is a true American patriot. THIS is the kinda guy WE&rsquo;RE taking about Jeb Bush. I wonder if old Joe could be persuaded to run for a higher office- -  Senator, Congressman or even President. Geez, wouldn&rsquo;t THAT be nice! </p>

		<p>The country is on the verge of bankruptcy and these corrupt leftist fanatics are concentrating soley on their agenda.  And why?  Because they don&rsquo;t care one whit if the economy collapses so long as their agenda is in place.  They have visions of coming back up in the next few years with their version of the rainbow utopia, but the poor fools are too dense (Or too arrogant? Or both?) to understand that they or their agenda will never survive, and we&rsquo;re almost certain to not only have an entirely different form of government, but a geographical disintegration as well.</p>
<p>The only thing real experts are positive of is that this present administration very likely will never survive until election day in 2012.</p>

		<p> You go, Joe! At last, a local elected official is standing up to the federal bullies, instead of taking the mealy-mouthed stance so popular with so many in power nowadays: &#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it.&#8221; There IS something you can do about it, and Joe Arpaio is doing it. Somebody get him a white horse!</p>

		<p>Joe Arpaio is a shameless showman who understands media hype inside and out; this is why his name is known all over the world and also why he is hated by some in the D.O.J.</p>
<p>It is far from certain that the system of electing certain people is a good one; those who recall the egregious Nifing in the Great Duke University Rape Hoax will remember that Nifong went ahead with a prosecution he KNEW was unsound in order to look good in the eyes of black electors.</p>
<p>Joe Arpaio ought to take over the Justice Department but that&rsquo;ll never happen. Certainly not with The One in the White House.</p>

		<p>I have a serious problem with the term &#8220;Racial Profiling&#8221;. What the hell does that MEAN exactly? If Sheriff Arpaio or any other angency is to crack down on illegal aliens, the majority of which we KNOW come from mexico, what other race other than latino are they supposed to look at? With the current illegal alien problem this country faces, how is it racists to ask someone if they are here LEGALLY?</p>
<p>Now some would argue that LEGAL immigrants get caught up in the cracking down of the ILLEGALS, but really, if you can provide proof that you are allowed to be here, what&rsquo;s the problem?<br>
I don&rsquo;t think the minor inconvenience of a few, should hinder the crack down on illegals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a shame that this sheriff can&rsquo;t openly say: You&rsquo;re damn right I&rsquo;m hunting down ILLEGALS (mexicans) and enforcing the laws of this country!  </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s amazing about this is it takes place in Arizona. Shouldn&rsquo;t police in Arizona be the most obsessed with the Hispanic rights pander? Are American Indian voters really that patriotic?</p>
<p>This could be the legacy of Barry Goldwater, famous Arizona rightist politician. Though unheralded, our work is never in vain. </p>

		<p>Arpaio should respond to this charge by detaining Swedish, German, and British tourists, and while at it, making it a point to detain any DOJ officials in his jurisdiction for as long as it takes to positively, beyond any doubt, establish their citizenship and documentation.</p>
<p>One can&rsquo;t be too careful with these illegal aliens.</p>

		<p>This man is a true patriot, and is beloved in Arizona. I adore the man. I&rsquo;m just surprised that he&rsquo;s not been brought down already. Anything right and patriotic is immediately attacked by the ACLU and the rest of the sniffling liberals.<br>
If anyone has the strength to endure the forthcoming fight, he does. But I&rsquo;m not sure even he can survive the stench of rotting Patriotism.</p>

		<p>Sheriff Joe is being harassed by none other than Eric Holder.  </p>
<p>His agenda is to reduce the white power base as much as he possibly can, because he despises whites.  He&rsquo;s going after anybody that tries to prevent the inundation of mestizos to this country, because he sees the process as a way to reduce white influence a little bit more. Too he concerns himself with nothing but things that affect blacks some way and only blacks.</p>
<p>He sees himself sitting at the back of the bus when it comes to whites and he can hardly contain his glee at having an opportunity at paybacks.  Old janet kept him pretty much in check, but he&rsquo;s free to do as he pleases now.  He was never the brightest bulb in her lineup, but she wasn&rsquo;t particularly swift herself.</p>
<p>Oh, these lefties, and their appointees with little ability and filled with outrageous hate.  They&rsquo;re just brimming over with it.</p>
<p>I wonder if this last bunch will be ran from office if the bottom drops out, say, about 2011 late or early 2012?  Be a shame if Holder was forced from office in disgrace.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t over yet, I believe the governor has the authority to remove him from office&hellip;.and there are LOTS of illegal voters in Arizona. I could be wrong though, it HAS happened before (me being wrong I mean)</p>

		<p>While I can&rsquo;t agree with everything Arpaio has done in the past, I can salute what he&rsquo;s doing here. The DOJ is merely showboating and just wasting everyone&rsquo;s time, and taxpayer money. </p>
<p>Back in the time of Prohibition, the federal government raided a bar in one of the big cities (NYC, Chicago, etc). The mayor of that city responded by having all the fed&rsquo;s vehicles towed as they were parked illegally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this exact trick wouldn&rsquo;t fly today, but if anyone was to even attempt this, it&rsquo;d be Arpaio. And I hope he does.</p>
