			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brenda Walker, euRabia, July 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If there is anything that should make Americans&rsquo; blood run cold about immigration, it is the sight of Europe  &mdash;  and Britain, the home of Western civilization  &mdash;  being buried by millions of Muslim colonists. Europe is just hoping against hope that Islam isn&rsquo;t going to explode into massive rioting (or worse), or impose total cultural Islamification.</p>
<p>Major jihadist terror occurred in London (July 7, 2005, killing 52 and injuring 700) and in Madrid (March 11, 2004, killing 191 and injuring 1841). Yet cowardly politicians continue policies of appeasement, which hostile Muslims correctly apprise as the fatal weakness of a culture too pacified to defend itself.</p>
<p>Some Europeans already accept the coming Eurabia. One Dutchman, mourning the future loss of Europe was quoted by Paul Belien as saying, &#8220;I am not a warrior, but who is? I have never learned to fight for my freedom. I was only good at enjoying it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s honest. But how about less self-pity and more directed anger? Many Americans I know in the patriotic immigration reform movement had a come-to-Jesus moment of awakening from passivity, turning to resolve to save the country.</p>
<p>Did America encourage Europe&rsquo;s socialist pacifism by protecting it too well, starting after the Second World War? Perhaps. Having your freedom handed to you on a plate is no way to appreciate its value.</p>
<p>Other causes of the continent&rsquo;s tragic downfall are rooted in recent history. They include business&rsquo; desire for cheap labor (so familiar!), a trendy belief in secular multiculturalism as a replacement for Christianity and apparent ignorance of Islam&rsquo;s long-standing enmity toward Europe.</p>
<p>Now the triumphs of Tours and Vienna are being trampled by immigrants, entering mostly legally. It&rsquo;s a wonder the Muslims bother with terrorism at all when demography is working so well for them.</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s swirl down the toilet bowl is little reported in this country largely because the Main Stream Media is not interested in showing it. The top media elites are still stuck on multiculturalism. But the European experience shows what a bogus ideology that is.</p>
<p>In 2004, CBS&rsquo;s Sixty Minutes did present a chilling and memorable segment about the crime-filled immigrant housing projects in France, The New French Revolution:</p>
<p>&#8220;But nothing prepared France for what happened to a 17-year-old French Muslim girl named Sohane Benziane. Her case really woke up the country to the nightmare that has been festering so long in these projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sohane was burned alive in the basement of an apartment complex by a gang leader who had told her that he didn&rsquo;t want to see her on his turf. After her murder, her sister, Kahina, dedicated a memorial at the site of her killing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though emotionally searing, the Sixty Minutes piece contained no mention that France&rsquo;s Muslim population is expanding rapidly. The number of Muslims residing in Western Europe in 1900 is estimated at around 50,000. Now France alone is home to somewhere between four and eight million followers of Islam.</p>
<p>Just recently, five years later, Fox News has carried a televised report, Politicians Fret as Muslim Population Swells in Europe Amid Little Integration [March 24, 2009].</p>
<p> &#8220;Although there are no official statistics on how many Muslims live in Brussels, it is believed they make up about 25 percent of the city&rsquo;s 1 million urban residents. [Filip] Dewinter, who opposes immigration and has called Islamophobia a &#8220;duty,&#8221; claims three of the 19 sections of Brussels, each with its own mayor, now have Muslim majorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;In those neighborhoods it&rsquo;s not our government that&rsquo;s in power,&rsquo; he said, &#8216;but the Muslim authorities  &mdash;  the mosques, the imams  &mdash;  who are in charge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;FOX News visited one of those neighborhoods, called Molenbeek, which looks more like North Africa than the heart of Europe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet Molenbeek remains disconcerting. Belgian police assigned three plainclothes officers to watch over a FOX News team shooting street scenes one morning in Molenbeek. When FOX News returned in the afternoon as more people were out and about, the police said it would be safer not to get out of the car. It wasn&rsquo;t even dark yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice this level of danger exists in Brussels  &mdash;  the supposed capital of the Europe Union.</p>
<p>News icon Edward R. Murrow is remembered in particular for broadcasting from London during the blitz to warn America of the threat to civilization posed by Hitler.</p>
<p>Had Murrow lived during our own time rather than WWII, he may well have tried to alert 21st century Americans to the present danger from totalitarian Islam on the march. But there is no modern Murrow to warn the people, because the MSM no longer does its job to inform about the pressing issues.</p>
<p>In the eye of the slow-moving storm, resistance to the invader is not particularly strong. Denmark has stiffened its entry requirements to keep out the unfriendlies, but it is the exception and not the rule. Italy&rsquo;s education minister has suggested that a limit of 30 percent foreign students be the limit per classroom, so that the immigrants assimilate to the national culture rather than the other way around. Naturally, the economic downturn has made the majority of Europeans want the excess immigrants to go home, but many governments prefer not to upset Muslims, who are famously sensitive about the most minor slight.</p>
<p>Many Muslims are happy to remain on the dole anyway. One example is generous Sweden, where the primarily immigrant Rosengaard neighborhood of Malmo has an unemployment rate of 70 percent. (Plus, the area is so violent that fire trucks need police escorts, and the number of rapes has tripled in 20 years.)</p>
<p>Americans often have a low opinion of Europeans, particularly the French (once described on The Simpsons as cheese-eating surrender monkeys, a rip that has stuck). But we hate to see Britain turn into a quivering bowl of sharia jello out of respect for our shared Anglophone culture.</p>
<p>Who could have imagined that the countrymen of Winston Churchill would meekly acquiesce to recognizing and rewarding polygamy? Multi-wifed Muslim families even receive extra welfare benefits for the various harem members and kiddies  &mdash;  though bigamy is still illegal.</p>
<p>There was an uproar last year when Archbishop Rowan Williams suggested that Islamic sharia should be accepted as part of British law.</p>
<p>Sharia law  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s the Muslim legal system that decrees the second-class status of women, executions for homosexuals and amputations for theft.</p>
<p>The Archbishop remains ensconced in Lambeth Palace, despite demands for his resignation during the sharia kerfuffle. In fact, weathering the crisis appears to have made him bolder.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the anniversary of the interview in which Dr Rowan Williams said it &#8216;seems inevitable&rsquo; that some parts of sharia would be enshrined in this country&rsquo;s legal code, he claimed &#8216;a number of fairly senior people&rsquo; now take the same view.</p>
<p>&#8220;He added that there is a &#8216;drift of understanding&rsquo; towards what he was saying, and that the public sees the difference between letting Muslim courts decide divorces and wills, and allowing them to rule on criminal cases and impose harsh punishments.&#8221;</p>
<p>[Archbishop of Canterbury: Society is coming round to my views on sharia, By Martin Beckford,, Daily Telegraph, Feb 15, 2009].</p>
<p>Is everyone assured that &#8220;harsh punishments&#8221;  &mdash;  flogging, amputations, etc.  &mdash;  will not occur at some future date?</p>
<p>And whatever happened to the proud tradition of the Magna Carta? Is nothing worth defending? How shameful to surrender founding legal principles of centuries&rsquo; duration so thoughtlessly to the Islamic interlopers.</p>
<p>Britain is fascinating to observe because it is far advanced along the immigration road to hell, especially given its powerful multicultural nanny state.</p>
<p>Plus, the extra helping of Muslims makes British cultural survival all the more challenging. The UK shows exactly what not to do in public policy  &mdash;  a combination of poorly chosen immigrants, the false ideology of multiculturalism and disempowerment (both physically and psychologically) by disarming the populace.</p>
<p>Sadly there seems to be little organized opposition among the traditional folk against their new alien overlords. However, there are uprisings of appropriate anger on rare occasions. One such was the outrage of Luton residents toward Muslims insulting British soldiers returning from serving in Iraq. Local people of all ages simply wouldn&rsquo;t allow Muslims to abuse the troops and proceeded to chase off the obnoxious hecklers. It was brief demonstration that normal patriotism (and therefore hope) has not been completely repressed by the liberal thought police in Britain.</p>
<p>But from this side of the pond, the UK looks like toast. In 30 years, London will likely be a sand-free version of Riyadh, with wall-to-wall burqas, and Saudi-style morality police in place of bobbies.</p>
<p>Yet even with Europe&rsquo;s Technicolor demonstration that Muslim immigration equals cultural suicide, American elites and the press still cling to the dangerous fable that we are somehow immune from those troubles because America does assimilation better than Europeans.</p>
<p>Perhaps we do in the area of employment opportunity. But that&rsquo;s not the point. We should instead be asking whether Muslim immigrants become loyal members of the US community  &mdash;  and many don&rsquo;t. A 2007 Pew poll found that only 28 percent thought of themselves as Americans first while 47 percent identified primarily as Muslims. Their loyalty lies abroad with the worldwide Muslim community (the ummah), which sees itself as being victimized by the West.</p>
<p>But because of what Enoch Powell called &#8220;obstacles which are deeply rooted in human nature&#8221; when grappling with slow-moving threats, we snooze on, despite the throbbing neon message of doom.</p>
<p>Muslim immigration to America is growing, but the overall number is still small as a proportion of population. But it&rsquo;s never too early to quit the habit. Clever analysts have noticed that when the percentage of Muslims in a non-Muslim culture reaches around 10 per cent, bad things happen.</p>
<p>America  &mdash;  let&rsquo;s not go there!</p>
<p>We are just as vulnerable to the actions of hostile Muslim immigrants as our fellow English-speakers across the Atlantic. But we still have the blessing of time. We could come to regret ignoring Europe&rsquo;s experience by allowing numbers of Islamists here to reach critical mass. Even a handful of determined jihadists can kill thousands, as we learned on 9/11.</p>
<p>We must realize as a nation that there&rsquo;s no right to immigrate  &mdash;  and we are foolish to welcome possible enemies.<br>

		<p>This article just depresses me even more than everday multifultural life.  For the small percentage of us that &#8220;get it,&#8221; now more than ever it is up to us to awaken the half-dead whites around us.  Experience can take decades and we do not have that much time.<br>

		<p>The Unbearably White Maureen Dowd and her kind are not concerned about this at all.</p>
<p>Indeed, as the second article on the main page points out, she and her kind think this diversity is just wonderful &hellip; for us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when we finally do save outselves (and I look for it to start in France or Germany) we will also have to save her kind. </p>

		<p>Great article.  Liberalism is not just a mental disorder, it is suicidal.  These Westerners got fat, lazy and happy living their cozy lives and forgot that vigilance is a virtue and one must constantly be on guard to defend your culture and history from those who would take it away.  These liberal elites, with their arrogance and smugness, are slowly destroying Europe and America.  The only saving grace is that U.S. citizens, being armed and appreciating freedom and independence, will resist and not surrender like the Europeans are. </p>

		<p>Britain has placed itself on a collision course. It&rsquo;s not a matter of them deciding to avoid it. It&rsquo;s too late for that now. They are destined for a head-on collision whether they want one or not. The only thing is that the longer they put it off the worse it will be. And they seem determined to put it off as long as possible. I found this interesting video on youtube. England, this is your future.</p>

		<p>Western society is collapsing. We are currently in the looting stage of the decline, soon the entire system will be bankrupt, from the individuals, corporations and businesses, to local, state, and federal governments; officially that is, when we cannot print any more money or borrow it. At that point pop cultural liberalism will die a fast death. It is already halfway there, pop culture is now gang culture.</p>
<p>Europeaners are a specific race of people with specific abilities. They basically invented everything, took over the planet, became very successful, but then became complacent, fat and happy, greedy, decadent, and now collapse.</p>
<p>But the sqandering of our riches will set society back, back to a mindset of natural law competition, and then all hell will break loose in Europe, when the &#8220;soccer thugs&#8221; start smashing some heads.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m still surprised that the Christian churches are going along with this. Are they even able to give reasons why people should be Christian anymore? The churches must believe that the Muslims in Europe will convert to Christianity eventually. Has anyone seen any writing on this? Are there published debates, interviews, or policy proposals on this? </p>

In white Western nations, there is ZERO reason that Muslims should be deciding ANYTHING. These are OUR countries, not theirs. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me that this simple fact   &mdash;   one of those truths we should be regarding as self-evident   &mdash;   even NEEDS to be said. </p>

<p>This is nonsense. America is every bit as ruined as Europe. The only advantage being that our immigrants are not mainly Muslims. That is simply luck. </p>
<p>Plus there is no comparison between Hitler and Muslim invasion. Believe me once the Hajis take over you will be wishing Hitler was here.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just Europe that&rsquo;s being overtaken by Muslims. It&rsquo;s happening here in Canada, wherever I go, including smaller centers that you would never think you&rsquo;d find third-world Islamists in. It used to be that you could feel reassured knowing that the third-world hordes settled almost exclusively in the largest cities of Toronto &amp; Vancouver. No more. And when I go to the United States, I see women in chadors all over the place. Who would have thought that Minneapolis, which was almost all white in the 1970s (as per &#8216;Mary Tyler Moore&rsquo; reruns I&rsquo;ve seen) would be Somali Central outside of Somalia? I try not to be despondent, but I have to seriously wonder if white, Judeo-Christian peoples and culture are truly doomed.</p>

		<p>I agree that the situation in Europe is distressing, but at least the Europeans are beginnning to wake up to the immigrant threat long before we did.  With the exception of France, every European nation is at least 90% white; compare that with the U.S. where whites only make up about 2/3 of the population.  In Europe there are already strong and growing nationalist movements; in America we have virtually no political representation. <br>
For anyone who is depressed after reading this article, check out the following website; the demographic projections we have been hearing are likely exaggerated: <a href="https://tinyfrog.wordpress.com/2009/05/03/muslim-demographics/" rel="nofollow">https://tinyfrog.wordpress.com/2009/05/03/muslim-demographics/</a></p>

		<p>Ever since a certain cartoon show sneered at the French for their refusal to take part in George Bush&rsquo;s Iraqi invasion, it has been trendy for some to swallow that particular propaganda line notwithstanding the fact that the Fox Network (makers of the aforementioned cartoon), had their own very particular special interest in attacking the French nation (rather silly in fact to attack the nation and not the government).<br>
  Anyhow, in case mericans have forgotten, they owe their very nationhood, freedom and independence to France - and ot to Britain who Ms Walker lauds - left to Britain the North american colonies would remain merely as colonies of exploitation - fine for siphoning off wealth to Britain, but unfit for anything else. <br>
Likewise French conduct in WW2 - the enormity of French losses in WW1 which traumatized a generation are ignored by the soft living comedy people at Fox as is the fact that the USA never deigned to involve itself in the European war until 1941, and the fact of the ignominious British rout at Dunkirk.</p>

		<p>Whites must wake up and realize we no longer have governments, because what used to be our governments place the Global agenda above all else and replacing the white citizenry with more easily controlled alien minorities is key to that agenda.<br>
  <br>
The choices that lie before us is clear; either take up arms against the traitors in our governments and then roust the alien minorities or roust the alien minorities first and deal with our government traitors second.<br>
  <br>
Stop pretending we are powerless to save our heritage and don&rsquo;t settle for watching the death of the white race on television.  Once aroused to action nothing can stand in our way, so prepare yourselves for battle because we won&rsquo;t survive without a fight.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The supreme function of statesmanship is to provide against preventable evils.&#8221;    &mdash;   Enoch Powell</p>
<p>Why, then, do so few in England, beginning with the Monarchy, heed these noble words?  And why do we in America persist in thinking It Can&rsquo;t Happen Here?  </p>
<p>Just a couple of questions for people to think about.  </p>

Once again we will have to send an American army to liberate <br>
Europe from tyranny.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T BANK ON IT!  With our current government ( and I mean the whites in Congress) we would only assist in Europe if it appeared the Muslim and African invaders were losing.  Remember George II backed the independence of Kosovo - an integral part of Serbia.  And William Jefferson Clinton bombed Christian Serbia.</p>
<p>And we wonder why Prime Minister Putin doesn&rsquo;t trust us!</p>

		<p>It has long been my fear that the Muslims will quietly come in and take over our country.  That is their stated goal in their holy book.  I personally feel that we should kick every last Muslim out of our country, back to where they came from.  Australia is the only country that&rsquo;s had the wisdom and guts to do exactly that.  The Muslims preach the overthrow of our government, and that&rsquo;s grounds enough for us to deport them.  If you have a mosque in your area, beware   &mdash;   they are teaching jihad and shariah law in there, and most especially to the kids.  I pray that the U.S.A. will not be as stupid and as cowardly as France and Britain in this matter.  If nothing else, just remember this:  the &#8220;Holy Koran&#8221; teaches that Muslims have only three options when dealing with &#8220;the infidel&#8221; (non-Muslims).  Those three options are (a) Convert them; (b) Force them to live as second-class citizens, with few rights; or (c) Kill them.  Those are the choices that will be given to Americans if and when the Muslims take over our country.  If you&rsquo;re not willing to fight for America, then you better decide which option you&rsquo;re going to take, because trust me - that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s coming.  I personally will fight to the death for my country and my freedom.  I hope a whole lot of others feel the same.  (And if you don&rsquo;t believe me, read the book called &#8220;Terrorist Hunter&#8221; - available at Borders or Amazon.)</p>

		<p>muslims don&rsquo;t need huge numbers to take over. one of the biggest truths of history, disguised by embarrassed europeans, was the size of the muslim armies that conquered spain and southern europe. most battles the muslims were out numbered. the biggest reason the muslims were and continue to be victorious was the fact the white european racial stock has had no cultural identity in over a thousand years, with the brief exception of the germans during the period 1939-1945. the muslims simply played one european leader and people against the other. many times the french, british, or austrians, were frequently allied with the muslims against their european brothers. we still see this character flaw in the white european as many of obama&rsquo;s most devoted and rabid defenders are white. nothing has changed. whites are the only race on the planet who regularly sell out their own kind. go to china or japan and make the case for cultural diversity and you will get run out of the country. the asians know it is suicide and simply refuse to allow it. japan has probably the most stringent of immigration laws in the world. if you don&rsquo;t have business there, or are stationed on an american base, you simply don&rsquo;t belong. they don&rsquo;t even have hatred behind this as japan is far more tolerant on those who visit than in any big city in the united states. they simply and rationally understand that their identity and heritage are more important than what the world cultural elites think of them.   </p>

		<p>Non white immigration is the problem, not only muslim immigration.  I don&rsquo;t trust people who complain about muslims but won&rsquo;t talk about race.  </p>
<p>Enoch Powell was primarily concerned with the immigration of non-Muslim blacks from the Caribbean.  </p>

Was quite right in mentioning that Enoch Powell&rsquo;s<br>
&#8220;Rivers of blood&#8221; speech was mainly aimed at Caribbean <br>
immigrants,who made up the bulk of the non-white population<br>
at the time(1968).He did later amend his earlier forecast with<br>
the warning that&#8221;It is with the peoples of the Indian subcontinent that we will contest the control of these islands&#8221;</p>

		<p>I am in cautious disagreement with the guy who said it&rsquo;s nonwhite immigration that is the problem.  First, I think that ISLAM - the religion first, and then its adherents - are the biggest problem we as a nation currently face.  We have got to get rid of these people and their religion, because if we don&rsquo;t they will murder us - and yes it is that simple.  Just chuck them OUT.  Secondly - I do not have any problem with people who immigrate here LEGALLY.  It is the ILLEGALS that I see as a huge problem, and just like the Muslims, we need to get rid of them - send them home where they belong and let their own country deal with them.  We have enough problems with our own people to be burdened with a bunch of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>I for one am not willing to be blinded by racial hatred so that I can&rsquo;t see clearly what the difficulties are in any given situation.  I do agree that we have racial problems in this country, but I think it is more class standing than race.  The ghettos and barrios do NOT breed civility, and it is in fact from there that most of the criminals are spawned.  But, these people are going to have to get THEMSELVES out of poverty; no amount of &#8220;giveaways&#8221; can make a civilized person out of a victim and entitlement-consciousness person.  That has been amply proven by the giveaway program in the sixties, and by the state of welfare and other entitlement programs today.  It is also why Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;level the playing field&#8221; theory is garbage.  It is CONSCIOUSNESS, not giveaways, that create desireable citizens   &mdash;   i.e. the will to take total responsibility for one&rsquo;s entire life, for who, where, and what you are here and now, always and forever.  That is the only solution to the present dilemma.  I doubt I will live to see it implemented.</p>
