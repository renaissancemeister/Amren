	<p><b>Sanctuary Cities: What Are They?</b></p>
<p>Despite a 1996 federal law [the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA)] that requires local governments to cooperate with Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), many large urban cities (and some small) have adopted so-called &#8220;sanctuary policies.&#8221; Generally, sanctuary policies instruct city employees not to notify the federal government of the presence of illegal aliens living in their communities. The policies also end the distinction between legal and illegal immigration  &mdash;  so illegal aliens often benefit from city services too.</p>
<p>A formal sanctuary policy is a written policy that may have been passed by a local government body in the form of a resolution, ordinance, or administrative action  &mdash;  general or special orders, or departmental policies. Formal sanctuary cities are the easiest to identify because they put their sanctuary policies in writing, which become subject to public records requests. {snip}</p>
<p>An informal sanctuary policy is a policy that does not exist on paper but none-the-less is carried out by government workers (administrative, service, or safety). {snip}</p>
<p>A local government&rsquo;s (e.g., township, village, city, or county) interaction with illegal aliens can evidence an &#8220;unwritten&#8221; sanctuary policy. {snip}</p>
<p>Statements and actions by public official can indicate a community&rsquo;s unwritten policy. {snip} News reports can also shed light on a local government unwritten policies.</p>
<p>One justification of creating sanctuary cities is often under the guise of protecting &#8220;immigrant rights.&#8221; But illegal aliens are not immigrants  &mdash;  immigrants come to the US legally, and maintain their legal presence. When a person is illegally smuggled into the U.S. or violates their visa restrictions  &mdash;  he/she is not an immigrant or visitor, but an illegal alien subject to deportation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>List of U.S. Sanctuary Cities*</b></p>
<p><b>*Note: Not all listings have been independently confirmed by OJJPAC.</b> If you believe a city should not be listed, please send an email, and OJJPAC will make note of the dispute and attempt to verify. Adjacent dates represent when a city was added to the list, not necessarily when it became (or allegedly became) a sanctuary city. Other notations may indicate the source of information. Cities without a date were added prior to May, 2007. Some sanctuary cities may not have yet been identified and therefore not listed below. You are encouraged to perform additional research regarding the status of your own city. The presence of illegal aliens in a city does not necessarily indicate that a city is a &#8220;sanctuary city.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sanctuary list was last updated on: 7-23-09</p>
<p><b>Alaska</b><br>
Anchorage (6/13/07 Congressional Research Service)<br>
(The city of Fairbanks is under review for removal from the Sanctuary Cities list due to the city council&rsquo;s passage of a resolution supporting a formal recognition of its cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. The city of Fairbanks had previously been listed due its designation as a sanctuary city by the Congressional Research Service. The city has disputed its listing. The City&rsquo;s resolution and a final decision will be posted soon. Fairbanks will likely be removed from the list and then its enforcement statistics will be monitored for compliance. OJJPAC thanks the City of Fairbanks for taking positive steps to clarify its compliance with federal law.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to to say the following about the list of Sanctuary cities. The whole thing is misleading. The truth is most city councils in almost any city in the U.S. are too cowardly or do not want to state that they will not allow illegal aliens to live in their city or will deport them to ICE if they do. I&rsquo;ll bet anyone there are thousands of cities, that illegal aliens can live in undisturbed.</p>

		<p>Although St. Louis is not listed here, from what I have seen, it might as well be on the list.  Neither the mayor nor the current or former Police Chief can give a straight answer to whether St. Louis is sanctuary or not.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it odd that California has the highest number of Sanctuary Cities, and is also the state with the greatest economic trouble. </p>
<p> And to think that the California government told us that &#8220;Immigration was the key to economic success&#8221;  It looks like they were wrong   &mdash;   massive immigration leads not to a better economy, but to economic (and social) disaster.  </p>
<p>Just 30 years ago, California was paradise, with the greatest, most respected education system in the world.  Now look at it!  Is it any surprise that when you import millions of Third World people, you get a Third World society?</p>

		<p>I would like to see a study done on the role of special interest business groups pushing this for cheap labor. I&rsquo;m betting that businesses who use unskilled cheap labor are the driving force for sanctuary cities.</p>

		<p>No city in Nebraska is on the list, but I can tell you Omaha doesn&rsquo;t do such a hot job policing it, either. I was once talking with my sister in law, saying something like I wish I could hire a couple of day laborers to help with something. She said I should just go to south Omaha and check the street corners. You can guess what she was referring to - south O is the Hispanic part of town.</p>
<p>And there are no Iowa cities on this list (not yet anyway), but it&rsquo;s a fact illegals forced many workers out of meat processing plants. Guess they weren&rsquo;t in &#8220;cities&#8221; or something.</p>

		<p>its funny how many people that live here in georgia just laugh at how &#8216;backwards&rsquo; we are, but i just want to thank the leaders in this state for not having ONE single confirmed sanctuary city!  it&rsquo;s comforting that even in &#8216;blue&rsquo; Atlanta, we still have some sensibilities</p>

		<p>I did not see Escondido, Oceanside, or Vista, CA on the lists.  All three cities are full of illegals.  I agree with above who realizes the whole thing is a joke.  The US is full of illegals.I overhear conversations 4 days/week suggesting America &#8216;pays&rsquo; for babies.  I see hundreds pregnant who do not speak English and who are living off my taxes.  In CA, as soon as illegal alien gives birth the certificate qualifies mother for monthly income of about $650.00/mo, Title 8 housing allowance, food stamps and medicaid for the babies.  No wonder CA is going BK. YET, no one dare mention this is where the nation is going. Women most often having children out of wedlock and government assistance from many government agencies.  The future of American politics will be owned by millions of women having babies for state/fed funds.  Their children will repeat the cycle. American educated hatred for traditional white culture has brought the moral fall that always preceeds the fiscal collapse.  Get ready because all the O voters know he is the delivery boy for the government redistribution of money &#8220;for THEIR children&#8221;  Illegals reside everywhere and both parties have neglected to enforce immigration laws so long the invasion is complete.  The most noteable identifier is language. Citizenship required English to keep US cohesive and unified.<br>
Now, the government wants/promotes diversity!  US has been betrayed by many charged to keep the Constitution and the laws.</p>

		<p>Pass this idea on to any shyster lawyers you may know. If you are a victim of a crime caused by an illegal immigrant, and you live in a sanctuary city- sue the city!  Why waste your time chasing ambulances, this is where the money is to be made. In Chicago, this would be easy to prove, his has sated that Chicao is a sanctuary city many times.<br>
   BTW, in some parts of the country, people are talking about succeeding from the USA. Chicago already has. We have our own immigration laws, aviation laws, tax laws, ect. The result is chaos. We want the feds to come back. When the troops mve in we will be standing by the road waving our american flags.</p>

		<p>Obama and Napolitano&rsquo;s new gig is to leave illegal workers alone, but to &#8220;fine&#8221; the employer. This is not done by raids, just paperwork and usually to the tune of $1,000.00. The business counts it as just another business expense. So, government is happy and pretends they&rsquo;ve done their job, the employer gets off with a slap on the wrist and the Illegal? If he&rsquo;s fired, he can remain in the land of milk and honey and find another traitor to hire him - and the saga continues.</p>

		<p>Santuary cities are practicing &#8220;nullification.&#8221;  This theory was used by southern states prior to the Civil War, and decisively reversed.  It is a much more serious verson of &#8220;contempt of <br>

		<p>Is there any penalty against Sanctuary Cities? Can Federal aid be cut off to New York City(oh, boy-we are talking billions).</p>
<p>If not, why not? This can and should be a major campaign issue. The Demcorats will think most Americans would be horrified to cut off health, welfare and education from say, Los Angeles because millions of illegals live there. WRONG. The sight of illegals waiing for their food stamps and for the closed schools would be hilarious. As would be the flip flop the mayors of LA and New York City would make when precious federal bucks vanish because of their stupid decisions to harbor the once beloved illegal trash that now litters the streets of those once great cities.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;It looks like they were wrong  &mdash;  massive immigration leads not to a better economy, but to economic (and social) disaster&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and the California governor recently assured us that the massive budget deficit and the need to raise taxes on productive citizens to record levels was &#8216;absolutely, positively not the fault of illegal immigration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to lose yet one more White neighbor who told me last night that he can no longer afford to do business in such a hostile business climate what with the onerous regulations he is forced to obey and punitive state taxes he is forced to pay.  </p>
<p>Add 40 more to the unemployment rolls (11.5% and rising) and subtract the taxes his business paid to the state coffers.  From what I can see of the many empty buildings around here, some sitting idle for over a year,  no one is standing in line to open a business.</p>
<p>I wonder who the communists in the legislature figure will support the massive, seething, growing, non-taxpaying parasitic class when the last productive business is driven out of California?  A massive voter base is being created here that will vote themselves ever more services leading to even more economic disaster.</p>
<p>I believe at some point in the near future, there will be land re-distribution, with the full backing of the federal government  &mdash;  after all, many in the parasitic class, besides blaming their own failures on White oppression, think that this is THEIR land. </p>

		<p>I was not surprsied to find that Sonoma County, CA is a sanctuary COUNTY.  I was literally driven from there due to having my office burglarized and ransacked by a Hispantic gang.  But it required a few years for the full effect and my &#8220;conversion.&#8221;  That was after I worked at a clinic where Hispanics were the overriding majority of patients and the staff was Hispanic (Mexican).  The insurance and WC fraud I discovered, that included a system of illegal immigration for the purpose of defrauding the State Workers Compensation Fund, caused me to quit my postion and finally see the light.  I should have caught on sooner back in 1997 when I discovered a Spanish first answering message when I called a County agency involved in fictitious name registration.  But we Californians saw it coming.  We did pass a bill that would have denied education and health care to illegals back in 1989.  The Hispanic lobbies (La Raza, etc.) sued and got it overturned.  But once you have that critical mass, you can no longer control your government because politicians are basically prostitutes.</p>
<p>Other posters are quite right: just because your town or city is not offically a sanctuary city does not mean that yours is not harboring - tolerating a huge population of illegals - and giving them all the privileges and freebies that has led California&rsquo;s economy, once the seventh largest in the world - to collapse.  This is what denial of reality produces.</p>

		<p>A few years ago. while stationed in the Charleston, SC area, I rented a apartment near the Naval Weapons Station. It was about 40% military (mostly nuclear officer and enlisted prototype students), a few college students, lots of illegals, and a smattering of others. One day while at a local Mall, I struck up a conversation with a fellow who worked at the Border Patrol Range (which at the time was on the grounds of the Weapons Station). I stated &#8220;Is it just me or are there a lot of illegals living at X apartments?&#8221; He confirmed that there were. His comment to this was quite interesting. &#8220;They&rsquo;re Nicaraguan dry-wall installers, and from what I hear, they do a h@ll of a job&#8221;. Just like in the book &#8220;1984&#8221;, this problem isn&rsquo;t meant to be solved. </p>

		<p>#26, Margaret, not all of the cities on the list have the hightest crime, drop out rates or lowest school grades. As I said, the one thing that unites ALL of them, is that all of the city councils and residents are too cowardly to do anything about their &#8220;STATUS&#8221;. To me, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s common to them all.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Yes, Mexico wants ITS land back&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite all appearances, California does not belong to Mexico, it is still a part of the United States.  Mexico was soundly defeated and $15 million was paid for the land.</p>
<p>Mexico fought and lost a war.  This does not give illegal aliens from mexico the right to enter a portion of the United States and claim it is &#8216;theirs.&rsquo;  It does not give mexico the right to blame the US for its own miserable failures.</p>
<p>Also Central America was once a part of Mexico, but Mexico lost that territory in the 1820s.  Why aren&rsquo;t we hearing about a Mexican reconquista of Central America?</p>
<p>Mexico is a failed narco-state that is only too happy to push its poorest, least healthy, least educated, least intelligent citizens across the border and then claim we are &#8216;racist&rsquo; for resisting this wretched flood.</p>
<p>According to Hispanics:  A Statistical Portrait:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Fifty percent of Hispanic households use some form of welfare, the highest rate of any major population group.</p>
<p>Even third-generation Hispanics drop out of school at a higher rate than blacks and are less likely to be college graduates&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The hostile elites in the government have allowed this outrage to happen, despite the protests of the White native-born population  &mdash;  the population that created the infrastructure, economy, technology, financial system and first-rate schools that California was noted for in the not so distant past.  </p>
<p>It is White civilization, a civilization that they do not have the intelligence to create for themselves that they covet.</p>
<p>Wonder how long the mexicans would last if California were &#8216;handed back&rsquo; to them exactly as it was before Whites created (what was) the Golden State?  </p>

<p>&#8220;Just 30 years ago, California was paradise, with the greatest, most respected education system in the world. Now look at it!  Is it any surprise that when you import millions of Third World people, you get a Third World society?<br>
And to think that the California government told us that &ldquo;Immigration was the key to economic success.&rdquo;   It looks like they were wrong  &mdash;  massive immigration leads not to a better economy, but to economic (and social) disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>California?  There&rsquo;s another excellent case of the  <b><i>&#8220;Cloward-Piven Strategy of Orchestrated Crisis&#8221;  </i></b>at work.  </p>
<p>California is nearing the brink of collapse and the Marxist &#8220;progressives&#8221;  are not lamenting it, they are rejoicing at it.  It&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve been working for all these years.  They don&rsquo;t want to sustain the USA, they want to destroy it.  Their dream is coming true.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope it backfires on them.</p>

<p>How typically selfish and short-sighted!
