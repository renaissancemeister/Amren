	<p><b>The White Children Were Totally Unprepared</b></p>
<p>I grew up in a white neighborhood in Akron, Ohio. I watched &#8220;The Little Rascals&#8221; on TV, and the black child on this program was my only exposure to blacks. In 1961, I graduated from grade school and was happy to be going to Jennings Junior High School, which also served a small section of a black neighborhood. Finally, I was going to have black friends.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember my parents having any opinion about the school, or about blacks. They told me that when I was a baby, Mom had a black lady who helped with chores. They also told me the lady got into a fight with her husband and bit off one of his fingers, but they told this story in a way that did not degrade blacks.</p>
<p>So here I am, walking to school, excited at the thought of new adventure. I was also a little shy and nervous. As I got near the school, which was located just inside the black neighborhood, I started seeing blacks. Then I heard screams and yelling like I had never heard before. I could see a group of agitated blacks swarming like bees. I was uneasy and moved to the opposite side of the street.</p>
<p>There were white children watching at a distance, and I asked what the blacks were doing. Someone said this group of 15 to 20 blacks was attacking a white child. There were so many blacks I could not see the person they were attacking. I had never seen such a frenzy, and was quick to get into the safety of the school. I never heard what happened to that white child; maybe he is an AR subscriber now.</p>
<p>The school turned out to be anything but safe. Although only 20 percent of the students were black, they all stuck together as a race, and they had control. All of them had flunked at least once, some twice, and one was reported to be 19 years old. Lunch time was pure hell. Blacks would get in the lunch line and intimidate the whites into buying them lunch. Some blacks would simply wait until a white child sat down to eat, and then take his lunch from him. When you left the lunch room you had to walk down a hall that was flanked by blacks on both sides. The intimidation was so great that many whites gave up money and other valuables without objection. The white children had come from completely different backgrounds, and were totally unprepared for this kind of treatment.</p>
<p>Several times a year all the students were sent to stand by their lockers while teachers patted you down and searched your locker. My teacher told me they couldn&rsquo;t search and take weapons from blacks without searching us, too.</p>
<p>One day, a black kid named Roger was tormenting a white kid. I was hearing it all and was so fed up with it! Without thinking, I got up and attacked Roger, beating him only as well as a 7th grader could. I survived the rest of the day without being mobbed, but I went home and made some crude weapons. I found a steel bar in my dad&rsquo;s shop to use as a club, and shaped one end of it into a handle. I also cut a piece of chain in case I needed to extend my reach. I went to school the next day and waited for the attack, since blacks had a history of ganging up on whites. The weapons would not save me, but I wasn&rsquo;t going to go down without doing as much damage as possible.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the blacks slapped me on the back, and called me &#8220;Roger&rsquo;s Man.&#8221; All the blacks knew me, and I got their protection. This came as quite a surprise, and saved a lot of money. The other white kids had to pay for protection. Apparently, the blacks were so stunned that a white would fight, that they gave me free protection.</p>
<p>I was the oldest of five children, and my parents were not going to let us all go through three years of this school, so we moved to the country. What amazes me to this day is that in 1960 a 20-percent black population could terrorize the whole school. All the school officials were white. They must have been in as much fear as we were. It was my experience with blacks at Jennings Junior High that formed my racial views.</p>

<p><b>A Genuine Lefty</b></p>
<p>I began as a genuine lefty: member of the ACLU and People for the American Way, contributor to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and a subscriber to the <cite>Washington Post Weekly Edition</cite>, <cite>The New Republic</cite>, <cite>The Nation,</cite> etc.</p>
<p>My conversion to reality was incremental, though not all increments were equal. Three events remain strongly in my memory, so I will credit them with my conversion, although they may only be representative of many similar events.</p>
<p>(1) Decades ago I read in the <cite>Washington Post Weekly Edition</cite> a story written by a woman on the editorial staff. It described how a group of young blacks had invaded her &#8220;fashionable Georgetown home,&#8221; burgled the place, beat up and hog-tied her husband, and gang-raped her. She wrote of how, during the oral-sex phase of the gang-rape, she told her attackers her mouth was too dry to continue. They brought her a glass of water and &#8220;touchingly&#8221; waited for her to drink it so she could continue. Her view was that these were poor, oppressed victims of white villainy, striking out in the only way they knew how, and she refused to cooperate in their apprehension and prosecution. Such idiocy led me to believe there was something sick about American liberalism.</p>
<p>(2) In 1993 I was living in South Texas. I worked late one evening, and as I was driving home in the dark a carload of Mexican kids forced me off the road and attacked me with baseball bats. They nearly killed me. Of the many cars that drove by, one elderly couple stopped, and with flashing lights and honking horn, scared the Mexicans away. The couple was, of course, white. They were apologetic for having wisely stayed in their car with the doors locked, but since they probably saved my life I felt extremely grateful to them.</p>
<p>The Mexican cop who arrived found my situation humorous, and chuckled and spoke Spanish with the emergency medical technicians (Mexican also) who treated me. At the hospital, X-rays showed that, amazingly, my skull was not fractured. I had a concussion, a lacerated cornea, and needed 30-odd stitches to resecure my scalp, but I lived.</p>
<p>To follow up on my case I was to contact &#8220;Sgt. Rodriguez.&#8221; I called a dozen times, but he was never there and never returned my calls. A friend from work knew a former Texas Ranger, then a private investigator. The PI laughed at me for going through channels. The police report had pretty well described the perpetrators (thanks to the elderly couple  &mdash;  I was a little foggy) and the car, including license number. He suggested that for $500 he could get another Mexican gang to kill my assailants. I didn&rsquo;t care to end up in front of a Mexican jury, so I tried to put the whole thing out of my mind. It cost me about $1,000 in medical expenses after my insurance paid its share.</p>
<p>(3) Growing up among the historical markers in Middle Tennessee, I became an amateur War Between the States historian at the age of seven (when I bought R. S. Henry&rsquo;s <cite>Story of the Confederacy</cite>). I have continued to collect books and artifacts of the Confederacy ever since. Many of my ancestors fought for the Confederacy. While browsing the Internet one day in the late 1990s, I stumbled across the story of the vandalization of Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s portrait in Richmond. I have read a great deal about Lee, and was outraged. Via the Internet I found <cite>American Renaissance,</cite> the Council of Conservative Citizens, <cite>Nationalist Times</cite>, <cite>Southern Patriot,</cite> etc. and have not turned back.</p>
<p>My older brother and father are cowards. They live in the hills, isolated (for the time being) from the real world. When I bring up, even obliquely, what is happening to our country their ears fold forward and they tremble in horror, as if the FBI had bugged every space in America and will throw people into jail just for listening to non-PC opinions. I am afraid most white Americans share the mentality of my brother and father. I am not hopeful. Perhaps ignorance is bliss.</p>

<p><b>What Pushed Me Over the Edge</b></p>
<p>My racial consciousness had been quietly forming for years before I became fully aware of the fallacy of egalitarianism and the folly of integration. What pushed me over the edge were the differing reactions of blacks and whites to the O. J. Simpson verdict.</p>
<div align="right"><i>Terrence Silva, Columbus, Ohio</i></div>
<p><b>Assumptions Put to the Test</b></p>
<p>Like most white Americans, I was taught to believe in assimilation. I felt a certain sympathy for blacks because I thought many were treated badly. I sincerely believed integration and civil rights would let blacks compete successfully in American society, and that the only thing holding them back was racism.</p>
<p>These assumptions were put to the test when I moved to the San Francisco Bay area, and on three different occasions was subject to criminal attacks or harassment by blacks. Once I was almost raped by a young black man. Another time I got into a physical confrontation with one. I was also held up at gun point by a black man and his Hispanic girlfriend. Later I moved from the Bay Area to a safer part of the state, and tried to put those incidents behind me, but I was reminded once again of the incompatibility of blacks and whites by two pivotal events: the riots in Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict, and the O.J. Simpson trial.</p>
<p>The riots in LA stunned me as I watched a cowardly white-run government cave in to arson, looting, and the wanton murder of whites. It was also instructive to see that the only people who had the sense to defend themselves were Koreans who  &mdash;  unhindered by white guilt  &mdash;  armed themselves and stood guard over their businesses. They did not apologize for wanting to survive nor did they scurry off like rats when the riots were over. This is what whites have been reduced to: A population in a constant state of flight.</p>
<p>Even more enlightening was the O.J. Simpson trial and its aftermath. I watched much of the trial on television. Mr. Simpson was obviously guilty but he got away with it because he was black, rich, and could afford to hire the best lawyers who blatantly used race to deflect attention from the evidence. As I watched blacks cheer the verdict, I realized that these people hate us. And they hate us because we are white. Who planted that hatred and nourishes it even today via the media, academia, and the government? That would be America&rsquo;s ruling class. One can only conclude that, white or not, America&rsquo;s ruling class hates white people nearly as much as any minority group does. Some of them may look like us, but they are not us.</p>
<p>There are calls for breaking away and forming a new country, and that may be our last hope. Barring that, I see whites disappearing as they interbreed, are killed off by minorities, or are reduced to a state of servitude by our ruling class. Many whites are so blinded by guilt that they can hardly wait to sign up for their own destruction. What do I have in common with these people even if they are white? Nothing.</p>

<p><b>&#8216;What a Bunch of Weirdo Nazis!&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>I am the child of two professors, who are, like most of their profession, dogmatically multiculturalist. From 1993 to 2002, I was a graduate student in comparative literature, and when I started out, I agreed with the Marxist, deconstructionist, multiculturalist intellectual orientation of the field. Although I soon began to be irritated by the mindless celebration of diversity, the lack of intellectual rigor, and the obscurantism of my field, it was not until much later that I started seriously to doubt the orthodox view of race that is at the basis of all contemporary work in literary studies.</p>
<p>Race is a major preoccupation of today&rsquo;s literary critics. Look at any one of the countless introductions to literary theory, and you will find at least one chapter devoted to work on the representation of race in literature. Such literary criticism, whose premises are unchallenged within the field, is devoted to exposing the ways in which whites have misrepresented people of other races in the interests of dominating them. For literary critics, racial differences are entirely the result of our cultural history, and they see it as their duty to change our culture in ways that will make these differences disappear.</p>
<p>My shift away from racial orthodoxy began when I became familiar with evolutionary psychology, the field that argues that all aspects of human behavior have an innate cause and that culture merely influences the unfolding of our innate nature. I began to go to conferences and read Internet discussion groups that dealt with evolutionary psychology. J.&nbsp;P. Rushton, Glayde Whitney, and Charles Murray regularly posted on Ian Pitchford&rsquo;s evolutionary psychology listserv, where other research on human racial differences, such as that of Richard Lynn, was discussed. I read some of the books of these thinkers. Although I felt a bemused revulsion for them at first, I soon came to realize how plausible they were. I read other books about the links between genetics and behavior, and learned that all human personality traits show substantial heritability; even how we hold our hands, how often we laugh, and the strength of our religious beliefs appear to be heritable.</p>
<p>So, when you see that there is an average difference of 15 points between the IQs of American whites and American blacks, and of 25 points between American whites and African blacks, the conclusion that at least some of this variance must be due to biology naturally follows. The same conclusion follows from the large and well-documented variances between whites and blacks in criminal behavior. I started to realize that my culture is founded on a massive denial of the truth that is sustained by what must be the most pervasive and successful propaganda campaign in history.</p>
<p>I began to notice confirmations of the ideas of the &#8220;racist scientists&#8221; in the world around me. For example, as J. P. Rushton shows, blacks are higher in self-esteem than whites and willing to deny the most obvious facts about the world in order to maintain their high opinions of themselves. I witnessed a striking instance of this trait. I taught an English composition class, and I had many black students. A few were decent, and a very few even outstanding students, but most were not. About half were abysmally dull and unteachable, but they had no problems finding ways to blame me for their troubles.</p>
<p>Slowly, I came to realize the true meaning of black culture. Although I live in a neighborhood of downtown Buffalo that is still majority-white, the ghettoes are very close, and one feels their influence everywhere. Blacks had heckled me many times, had bullied me once, and even mugged me once. But I had not reflected on these experiences before I started reading about race. I now became fully conscious of the insecurity and disgust that my neighborhood inspired in me. Blacks were the primary reasons for these feelings, but I found the Hispanics and Arabs who also congregated in my neighborhood scarcely better.</p>
<p>I also began to notice the genetic deterioration in our society. My neighborhood thronged with the retarded, alcoholics, drug addicts, and the homeless, who were housed in downtown &#8220;group homes.&#8221; It added to the offense that rich bureaucrats who lived in upper-class neighborhoods would put these people in my midst and keep them away from their own homes. It horrified me that these people might be reproducing. I am amazed that people consider eugenic sterilization inhumane, but don&rsquo;t consider it inhumane to subject residents of downtown neighborhoods to a parade of freaks.</p>
<p>Were these people  &mdash;  the blacks, Arabs, Hispanics, the handicapped, and the homeless  &mdash;  making my life richer and more vibrant, as liberal propaganda claimed they were? I had been inclined to think so before. I had thought it rather romantic to live in such a cosmopolitan environment, and I had even taken a sort of pleasure in the presence of freaks. But I came to realize that I had never genuinely enjoyed the daily sight of these people; they were offensive, discouraging, and alienating. The vibrancy and richness that remained came from the white people who were still clinging to their downtown neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The consequence of the American racial problem that was most personally relevant to me was its utter desolation of the humanities. When I started graduate school, I thought multiculturalist activism in literary studies was a peripheral phenomenon. Surely, underneath it all, I thought, remained some of the great intelligence that one sees in the classic works of literary scholarship written before the 1970s.</p>
<p>For nine long years, I persisted in the belief that there was something at the core of my field that was worthwhile. But when I finally finished my Ph.D., after having written a 350-page dissertation on Scott and Byron, published three research papers in scholarly journals, and gained the respect and friendship of the most intelligent people in the field, I realized I had been wrong. In fact, it was the intelligent people who were at the periphery of the field; the core was rotten.</p>
<p>People in my field have, by and large, ceased to be interested in producing interesting and challenging readings of texts. Rather, literary studies boils down to a competition among whites in which each tries to prove that he loves blacks more than his colleagues do. After reading hundreds of vapid books and articles in academic journals, I concluded that the only way to get ahead in today&rsquo;s academy was to argue that some classic literary text was even more racist than previous critics had believed. I had no interest in spending any more time in such an abominably trivial community.</p>
<p>Like a few other people in literary studies, I had tried to integrate the interpretation of literature with evolutionary psychology. I found that evolutionary psychology had the potential to bring about a sea-change in the interpretation of literature because it offers theories of sexual behavior, social relations, perception, and language that are vastly more interesting and well-grounded than the established ones. As an example, I wrote an article that examined the way in which innate aggressive impulses were reconciled with modern norms forbidding violence in the historical novels of Scott. The evolutionary psychologists that I talked to took such interpretations to be obviously plausible, but I could never get most of my colleagues to grant my premise that a biological human nature existed, no matter how much hard evidence I gave them.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people reject evolutionary psychology, but surely the primary reason is that multiculturalists believe that once people start thinking seriously about the biology of human behavior, they will start to have subversive ideas about the causes of racial differences. They are right about this; that had, in fact, been my own experience. I came to realize that I was in a field that had effectively barred the way against any progress in the understanding of its subject matter, because of its practitioners&rsquo; need to uphold the dogma of racial equality.</p>
<p>I found that, in order to be accepted in literary studies today, one must not only tolerate the fallacious view of race that inspires so much of the work in the field, but one must actively affirm it. The academy is pervaded by a nasty, policing atmosphere. My colleagues were always prying to make sure that I held the correct view of race. A conversational gambit they frequently use is asking someone how his ideas relate to racial issues. A propos of nothing, literary critics say things like, &#8220;Well, I think we should bring race into this discussion&#8221; or &#8220;We should look at that argument from a post-colonial perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>I became aware of AR&rsquo;s website in 2001, late in my graduate career. I learned of it through one of my evolutionary psychology listservs. At that time, even though I had come to accept the reality of racial differences in behavior, I had not yet accepted the idea of a political project based on these ideas. My initial reaction to AR was therefore the same as my initial reaction to so-called &#8220;racist science&#8221;  &mdash;  bemused revulsion.</p>
<p>The first thing I remember reading on the website was an article called &#8220;<a href="/ar/2001/10/index.html" target="rearing" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Rearing Honorable White Children</b></a>&#8221; [Oct. 2001]. It was about families that had entirely seceded from American culture because they could no longer recognize it as having anything to do with themselves. They discouraged their children from watching television and blocked out most of the programming that came in through it because they didn&rsquo;t want their children to be exposed to our culture&rsquo;s massively distorted values. Instead, during the evening they played chess, watched classic films, and read and listened to classic Western literature and music. They home-schooled their children because they hated the anti-white atmosphere of our schools, and did not want their children to consort with the children of criminals.</p>
<p>My initial reaction, which had been programmed into me by years of muticulturalist propaganda, was, &#8220;What a bunch of weirdo Nazis!&#8221; But my impulse as an intellectual, an impulse that is so rarely in evidence in the academy today, is to get past the obvious and ready-made reaction, and to consider problems with some objectivity, to try to see things from a different perspective. And I realized that I couldn&rsquo;t stand most of what was on TV either, that I disliked the version of history taught at American schools, and that what these parents enjoyed  &mdash;  playing chess, reading 19th century literature, listening to Beethoven  &mdash;  was exactly what I enjoyed doing myself. These people were, in fact, very much like me.</p>
<p>Not only that, they were like many of the white intellectuals I knew who had never doubted the orthodox view of race. My father, for example, is a professor of religious studies who is always going off to Africa or the Caribbean to teach blacks &#8220;liberation theology,&#8221; a sort of commingling of Marxism and Christianity. But what does he do in the evening? Listen to rap music? Watch Martin Lawrence movies? No, he reads Dickens, plays chess, and listens to the great 19th century German composers. Without knowing it, he too acts according to a spirit of racial loyalty, and while the expressed purpose of his life is to liberate blacks, he has no real sympathy with their lives and culture.</p>
<p>After I finished my Ph.D. last summer, I took a job doing low-level office work. I don&rsquo;t like the pay, and I don&rsquo;t like the tedium, but I do like the anonymity. No one cares what I think, so no one pressures me to engage in ritualistic affirmations of multicultural dogma, as I was forced to do in the academy. So I bide my time, wondering whether I am just a disappointed and bewildered crank approaching middle age or the harbinger of a coming Renaissance.</p>

<p><b>Yggdrasil Caught My Attention</b></p>
<p>I am from a small town in the Pacific Northwest and had almost no contact with people of other races until after age 21. I am in my forties now. I was completely &#8220;liberal&#8221; about race until my early thirties. I was aware since my teens that the average IQ score of blacks is 15 points lower than that of whites, but I thought the cause was cultural factors. I remember thinking that there are different subspecies (races) of birds, but they all fly well even if they have distinctive colors, and that it was therefore unlikely that different races of people would have a significant difference in the most essential characteristic of humans: intelligence. In my upbringing race was never mentioned at all. My family hardly ever spoke about politics, either, but I am sure they were Democrats.</p>
<p>When I was a child I remember seeing television footage of black protesters being pushed back with fire hoses, and hearing that they were excluded from Southern &#8220;whites-only&#8221; restaurants. I remember thinking that we Yankees were morally superior, since it was obvious that all you had to do to get along with black people was treat them courteously and fairly.</p>
<p>I learned Spanish and went to live in Mexico for a year after dropping out of college. I was amazed at the corruption. I had to pay many bribes to police despite having done nothing wrong. Ordinary people were very dishonest, too. I don&rsquo;t remember thinking about immigration at all. This was the early 1980s, before immigration became really massive. I was still &#8220;liberal&#8221; on race but I wasn&rsquo;t afraid to recognize negative cultural differences between us and Mexicans. When I returned to the US I found people were uncomfortable if I told them about my experiences with corruption, even though I refrained from making any racial or cultural generalizations.</p>
<p>I moved to the Southwest and attended a trade school that was about 40 percent black. That was the first time I had been around large numbers of black people. I dated black women and even wound up living with one for three years. Race was not a factor in our eventual break up and (thank goodness!) we had no children. At that time I worked in a company where 50 percent of the workers were black. My opinion of black people was starting to erode but I still clung to the idea that blacks are culturally deprived. Ebonics and cursing grated on me, but I attributed all &#8220;differences&#8221; to social class and deprivation.</p>
<p>I can remember a few incidents that roused the first traces of race-consciousness. I remember telling a dirty joke to one of my black co-workers, which included the word &#8220;prostitute,&#8221; and it dawned on me that he didn&rsquo;t know the meaning of the word! I know he understood the concept because he once invited me to go look for &#8220;hos&#8221; after work, which I found repugnant.</p>
<p>I once told another black co-worker I had lived in Mexico and spoke Spanish, and it became clear he didn&rsquo;t know where Mexico was, and didn&rsquo;t know that Mexican-Americans speak Spanish rather than &#8220;Mexican.&#8221; He also didn&rsquo;t know the locations of any of the states in the Pacific Northwest. The change in my thinking was taking place on a more or less unconscious level.</p>
<p>I was still living with my black girlfriend. She had an IQ of 105 and spoke Standard English, so gave me no reasons to re-examine my thinking, but I do remember something that made me wonder whether our relationship was a good idea. I was watching a television talk show about racially-mixed people, and a woman in the audience said she was mixed because some slave master raped one of his female slaves. It occurred to me that she probably knew nothing about her ancestors, and that it was just as likely she had an ancestor who was a prostitute impregnated by a white customer. It was striking to me that even mixed-race people demonize whites. I could imagine my great-great-grandchildren with this black woman being just as anti-white, and saying they were mixed because I had raped her.</p>
<p>Some time after I broke up with her I got a new job in a place with full-blown affirmative action. The workforce was 80 percent black, in an area that was about 20 percent black. Management was 80 percent black, too, and blacks seemed to feel freer to be themselves in such an environment. Every day I would hear the word &#8220;mother-f*r&#8221; shouted out within 30 seconds of coming to work. I once saw a middle-aged black man pantomime anal rape, saying &#8220;Ah&rsquo;m gonna be <i>oooon</i> yo&rsquo; ass, m*f*r, Ah&rsquo;m gonna be f*ing on yo&rsquo; mother-f*ing ass!!&#8221; I had been making allowances for blacks but now I began to see an unmistakable, dramatic difference between blacks and whites of the same socioeconomic class.</p>
<p>Affirmative action completed my mental transformation. I had uncritically accepted the media view that it was an extra effort to search for qualified minorities, but at this new job it was obviously about lowering standards. I saw a white man with a BA passed over for a promotion that went to a black nincompoop who must have had an IQ of 75. I was enraged at how the mass media insist whites are not hurt by affirmative action. My first full-blown heretical thought was: &#8220;They really are as stupid as they sound!!&#8221;</p>
<p>I started looking for information  &mdash;  on the Internet because I didn&rsquo;t want to have to explain ordering a &#8220;racist&#8221; book in a bookstore. I started lurking in the Usenet group alt.politics.nationalism.white. The posts of someone calling himself Yggdrasil caught my attention and I started collecting them. I had been thinking of getting some of the books he mentioned, and by chance I came across a couple of them in a used book store. The first racialist book I read was Jared Taylor&rsquo;s <a href="/store/paved_with_good.html" target="paged" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b><cite>Paved with Good Intentions</cite></b></a> and the next was <cite>America Balkanized</cite> by Brent Nelson. Since that time, almost ten years ago, my interest in ethnic conflict has prompted me to read about 200 books, though many of them are on broader subjects, like general political science.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had much success in changing anybody&rsquo;s mind. I&rsquo;ve tried talking with relatives about immigration but it just makes them uncomfortable. Most people are committed to conformity. I did get one person to read about a dozen carefully selected books, but his reaction was very odd. He started babbling about how at one time the Irish weren&rsquo;t even considered white, which was hilarious because none of the books said anything about the Irish. It was like trying to deprogram a cult member.</p>

<p><b>I Was a Red-Diaper-Baby</b></p>
<p>If the definition of a liberal is someone who has never been mugged, then to know my history is to understand my political journey.</p>
<p>I was a red-diaper-baby. That is, my father was a card-carrying member of the Communist Party USA. Years later, he came partly to his senses, but remained a liberal on all issues, including race. Predictably, my parents encouraged their children to go forth and enjoy the multi-racial joys of New York City. I even marched with Martin Luther King when he made his famous speech, but his dream became our nightmare. Multi-racialism resulted in a private, and on some level deserved, holocaust for my family and me.</p>
<p>I am the eldest of five. One of my sisters, who was 13 at the time, was raped when she attended a party on our block. One of the blacks repeatedly asked her to go upstairs to see his apartment. After several rejections, he accused my sister of racism. As a well-indoctrinated, guilt-ridden liberal, she had no choice but to go with him. Out of fear and shame, my sister did not share her story with us until she landed in a mental ward a couple of years later.</p>
<p>Another sister was raped by a black open-enrollment &#8220;student&#8221; at City College in a locker room after she attended a co-ed swim class. The prosecuting attorney told my sister it was an open-and-shut case because she did everything she was supposed to do: She reported the event immediately, gave a detailed description of the accused (including a bizarrely shaped goatee), and then went directly to the hospital. However, after all the evidence was given, when the jury was polled, the whites voted to convict, but the tribe hung together and hung the jury.</p>
<p>Ironically, before her trial even began, another black tried to rape her in the elevator of her own building. He entered the elevator after her, and sent it down to the basement. There he cut her neck and was about to have his way with her, when someone luckily brought the elevator back up.</p>
<p>The following term, when my sister attended her first political science class, she found that the black who had raped her after the swim class was to be her classmate. She marched off to the administration office in a fury, where she loudly threatened to sue the school for its lack of security. They settled then and there by agreeing to pay for her to complete her education in Israel.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s wrist was broken when an African American relieved her of her pocketbook. I, myself, had a gun at my head twice on the streets of New York when blacks mugged me.</p>
<p>During the period of my family&rsquo;s holocaust in the late &rsquo;60s and early &rsquo;70s, I was starting my career as a teacher at George W. Wingate High School in Brooklyn. It had recently opened as the city&rsquo;s first deliberately-integrated high school. At first, it offered a good education, but I was struck by the differences in the abilities, work ethic, and behavior of the races. I also noticed that the students segregated themselves in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Integration can be defined as the period from when the first black moves in until the last white moves out. As the school began to tip in the expected direction, there was racial violence and several race riots. This festering condition culminated in the infamous Day of Knives. On the last day of the school year, as the students were going home, many blacks menaced their white classmates with knives, and warned them not to come back. The whites got the message and stayed away.</p>
<p>I served as dean of boys during the last of my eight years at that school. We averaged five arrests a day out of a student body of about 3,000. One of my duties was to convince fearful parents of victims to press charges. Every day a paddy wagon came from the local precinct to process the day&rsquo;s catch. Sometimes we ran out of handcuffs.</p>
<p>There were junkies nodding out in the cafeteria, and the aroma of pot was everywhere. It seemed as if more students roamed the halls than attended class. Every six weeks or so, a teacher could be expected to be sent to the hospital. I remember one young handicapped woman who walked with a cane. Someone pushed her down the stairs, and she did not come back until the following year. After only a few days someone pushed her down the stairs again. She never came back.</p>
<p>I also recall the day a substitute cop was assigned to my office. At first, he put his feet up on the desk and expressed pleasure with such an easy assignment. By the end of the day he was complaining he was working harder than a desk sergeant.</p>
<p>One Senior Day started with water pistol battles, graduated to entire waste baskets full of water, and then fire extinguishers. The school had to be evacuated because the water was ankle deep. In one five month period, five of our students had either committed murder or had been murdered. One teacher who was assigned to the school left for lunch on his first day and never came back.</p>
<p>By the 1980s I had developed an interest in the race question. My family and former friends would call it an obsession. They typically dealt with The Problem by running away from it. To me, how liberal a person is on the topic is usually a function of his geographic distance from it.</p>
<p>I have always been interested in statistics, and my first exposure to racial stats came when I was watching a television program about the Bernie Goetz case. [Mr. Goetz was a white New Yorker who shot several young blacks who were trying to mug him.] I was stunned when the announcer said blacks were ten times more likely to commit a violent crime than whites  &mdash;  stunned not by the number, but to learn that this information was available and being discussed. I sent for the transcript, and found myself compiling a collection of articles on crime. My next great discovery was Charles Murray&rsquo;s <cite>Losing Ground.</cite> In 1992, I learned about Jared Taylor&rsquo;s <a href="/store/paved_with_good.html" target="paged" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b><cite>Paved with Good Intentions</cite></b></a> from the Bob Grant radio program. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>It has not been easy for me as a New York Jew, embracing the views that I do. I am regarded as a pariah when I express myself. Mostly by choice, I am estranged from my family. My comrades are my gentile wife and retired former colleagues who have shared my professional experiences and who have drawn similar conclusions from their observations.</p>

		<p>I grew up in and around Detroit.  I lived in inner-city Detroit with my parents from age three months to three years, then we moved to the suburbs  &mdash;  probably so I could start preschool in a suburban school (this was in the mid-70s).</p>
<p>There seems to be a kind of tacit acknowledgement that if there are blacks walking around and the neighborhood looks seedy, you shouldn&rsquo;t hang around.  My dad knew Detroit like the back of his hand, and if my class was going to a field trip in Detroit, he gave or denied permission based on what street the place was on.</p>
<p>My awakening came slowly.  It&rsquo;s just during the past couple of years that I realized that the races are different  &mdash;  and that the difference goes beyond skin color.  I now live in a semi-rural part of Ohio, not too far from Akron, and hindsight is 20/20.</p>
<p>A mall in Akron, Rolling Acres, closed recently.  Someone I know once referred to it as &#8220;Rolling Afros.&#8221;  From reading Topix boards, I found that the problem appeared to be that blacks would harass white shoppers, and the mall lost business.</p>
<p>I think my dad, who died 9 years ago, was racially aware.  He witnessed the 1967 Detroit riots first-hand  &mdash;  he was working at a Wrigley&rsquo;s supermarket down the street.  During that time he&rsquo;d sit on the porch at home with a shotgun, he once told me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate blacks  &mdash;  let&rsquo;s make that clear.  But I don&rsquo;t care much for their culture and their &#8220;give me that&#8221; mentality.</p>

		<p>I really appreciate these stories. I am a former multiculturalist Marxist myself. It wasn&rsquo;t until very, very recently that I became comfortable with admitting that I am indeed racially aware. I always knew the truth deep down inside, but the fear and shame of being labeled the old &#8220;r&#8221; word, &#8220;racist,&#8221; kept me not only publicly embracing multiculturalism while denouncing my race, but I was lying to myself, as well. I think there are a lot of other white people out there who feel the way I did. It is my goal to let them know that it is ok to reject the constant shoving of anti-white multiculturalist propaganda down our throats, that it does not make you a backwards, knuckle dragging uneducated &#8220;racist.&#8221; </p>
<p>The only thing, however, about most of these stories is that it seems they come from older males. I am a young, early 20-something year old female, so it would be nice to hear from some younger gals like me, if there are any out there.</p>

		<p>This is why no white Northerner should ever condemn any white Southerner - past or present.  Although only a tiny percentage of white Southerners held slaves, all Southerners were exposed to blacks and black behavior.  It was only the iron fist of the Southern white man that kept blacks in check.  Why is it that there was relative safety in the South while the black cities of the North were plague with crime and brutality?  Why would anyone think that a group of uncivilized people taken from an uncivilized land would naturally conform to a civilized world?  Who is it that we say has the higher IQ?<br>

		<p>Wow, these anecdotes are amazing   &mdash;   perhaps the best thing I&rsquo;ve ever read on Amren (and I&rsquo;ve read a lot of good material on here!).  Thanks for posting.  It&rsquo;s comforting to see a shared experience among community members   &mdash;   and to see just how normal we all are.</p>

		<p>Being around blacks and having experience interacting with them is the best cure for racial naivette. People who only know blacks from television and Hollywood have no appreciation of what blacks are REALLY LIKE. Historically the British, Canadians and many continental Europeans had no clue what blacks are truly like. This would probably also include many American Whites who didn&rsquo;t live in black areas or close to them. In my particular case having to work with Jamaicans was the key to my path to racial awareness. </p>

		<p>To #2 Anonymous, I am a young white male (well, early 30s) and I know exactly how you feel.  Anymore I will say something that modern culture deems &#8220;racist&#8221;, but I will say it confidently and usually say, &#8220;That&rsquo;s how I feel and I really don&rsquo;t care if I am a racist.&#8221;  Once you say it confidently and make it clear you don&rsquo;t care if you are &#8216;racist&rsquo;, they will be stammered.  You see, most people (even whites) think calling you a racist will shut you up.  It&rsquo;s a mind game.  Just keep saying, &#8220;Call me a racist all you want, I don&rsquo;t care.  That&rsquo;s how I feel and I&rsquo;m going to say it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many of us have noticed this.  My sister lives in New Hampshire, still overwhelmingly white.  So she gives money to People for the American Way and always votes for Democrats.  All she knows about race is what she sees on TV, where the bad guys are always middle aged white men and the blacks are macho, streetwise cops and FBI agents, when they aren&rsquo;t computer geniuses.</p>
<p>As whites become more of a minority more of them will become race realists, but by then it will be too late.<br>

I love reading (and re-reading) peoples personal experiences with race. While I admire AR for it&rsquo;s presentation of scholarly work on race, for me, there&rsquo;s nothing like reading or hearing someones first-hand account of how they became racially aware (though most are remarkably similar).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see AR solicit and print such personal accounts on occasion. What it does for me, and I&rsquo;m sure for others, is let them know they&rsquo;re not crazy for seeing the world as it really is. Others have seen the same things and had the same experiences. I believe this helps others to come to terms with their own views and gives them the courage to speak out.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re not crazy. They&rsquo;re the crazy ones for believing such obvious lies. We are the sane. We are the voices calling out in the wilderness.<br>

		<p>I am from the rural South and now live in Boston.  And I can say, it is waaayy more segregated than most places back home.  And what is so bad is that all these yankee libs are so condescending towards Southerners on all things racial, yet they never seem to spend any time in all the wonderful, multicultural areas of the city.  They stick together like a bunch of Compton Crips and denigrate everyone else for being racist.  Bunch of sorry hypocrites. </p>

		<p>I grew up in a middle class, white section of Memphis, Tennessee in the seventies and eighties. <br>
My elementary school was directly across the street from our house, and a park and community center were next to it. It was a great place to live. The small homes were neat and well-kept. It was so safe that we could ride our bicycles to and from our friends&rsquo; homes until late at night and our parents didn&rsquo;t have to worry. Our schools, churches, shops and theaters were all within walking distance. Most of my extended family lived within a few blocks. It was ideal in most every way.<br>
However, the schools had been integrated, so every morning you would see busloads of blacks coming into our neigborhood for school. It was obvious from my very first day of kindergarten that the black kids hated the white kids. They constantly tried to bully the whites, but the white kids stuck together pretty well at first, while we were still an overwhelming majority.<br>
By the time I was in sixth grade, I had a black teacher who was overtly hostile to me because I didn&rsquo;t back down to the racial bullying and white guilt trips that she and some of the students tried to lay on me. I think she particularly disliked me because we had the same last name, and in retrospect I suspect she may have wondered if her ancestors had been owned by mine. My ancestors were poor, and were not slave owners.<br>
Once I moved on to junior high school, (also in my neighborhood), the ratio of black to white students had increased significantly. I hated gym class because the white teacher hid out in his office after class instead of supervising the locker room where the black students (many of them older and larger because of being held back), pushed around the white kids. I was beaten on more than one occasion because I refused to take it lying down, and the other white kids just stood and watched. They were no longer sticking together now that the numbers and sizes of the blacks had increased. It was clear at that point that it was every man for himself. I got through junior high and was accepted to a nearby high school that was well-regarded locally for its performing arts program (I played viola in the orchestra). Probably because of the focus on the arts, the blacks in that school (for the most part) seemed more civil, so I didn&rsquo;t have anymore fights. However, when I had to take ROTC instead of Phys. Ed. because of a scheduling conflict, I had a black instructor who liked to push around the three white students in the class. We complained to the administration and to our surprise, the instructor stopped pushing us around for the remainder of the semester. <br>
The next year my father was transferred with his job and we moved five hours away to the eastern part of Tennessee. Blacks were a very small minority in my new school (less than 2%), so there were absolutely no problems with race from that point on. <br>
We made occassional visits to family in our old Memphis neighborhood, and from the outside looking in we could see how drastically our neighborhood was changing. At first there were just a few black families moving in, then the white flight began and more blacks moved in. Crime went up immediately. The houses started looking trashy and the property values stagnated.<br>
I have since moved back to the area, although I now live in one of the few affordable homes in a more affluent bedroom community located just east of the city. <br>
I took a drive out to my old neighborhood last week since it had been years since I had gone there. It looked like a ghetto. There was grafiti spray painted on the wood fences, and chain link fences surrounding the fronts of some of the houses with locked gates at the ends of the driveways. Grass was high and litter and junk were everywhere. There were cash for title places and liquor stores all around. The shopping mall was torn down years ago, which is almost always the case once a neighborhood goes black and the white shoppers go elsewhere. The park looked ominous and the school looked run down. The few white holdouts that I saw walking by or working in their yards looked defeated and weary. It made me kind of choke up to see what had become of the streets and parks where I played as a child. <br>
My point is that all of this happened as a result of the blacks moving into the neighborhood. Whites were the overwhelming majority of residents in that neighborhood from the early sixties until the early nineties and it was a nice place to live. Blacks managed to destroy it completely in just a few years. Now the crime is so bad and the scenery is so ugly that the blacks don&rsquo;t even want to live there anymore. After all, the locusts leave a field once the crops are all destroyed. Then they move on to the next one. <br>
Thanks to fair lending legislation and subprime mortgage loans, some of the nicest areas in my county have been bombarded by blacks and hispanics. One of the county high schools that used to be considered one of the best around here is now a hotbed of gang activity. It wasn&rsquo;t a problem before the non-white minorities moved in. How can anyone deny the connection here? It still amuses me how liberals can say that minorities don&rsquo;t cause property values to drop. It isn&rsquo;t racist, it&rsquo;s statistical fact.<br>
This is my story of how I saw the light, and have always seen it from a very young age. <br>

It takes people a while to wise up and grow up   &mdash;   and to accumulate enough experiences in life to force them to re-assess all the official, orthodox notions that they have been indoctrinated with. Maybe you just matured earlier than most of the rest.  </p>
<p>As for the others, how many exxperiences can they have had in their early twenties?  It may take them some years to come around. We wise up at different rates.  Some of them, frankly, will never learn to think for themselves.  Or maybe they will just be fortunate and not have any harsh experiences that will compel them to do some thinking and grow up.</p>

<p>A great first step, but my grandparents would be bewildered that we pester ourselves constantly over a word they had never even heard until shortly before their deaths, the word &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>My grandparents thought it obvious that whites were better than blacks (in all the ways that mattered to my grandparents!), and that our society should be arranged so that whites could control impulsive and violent black behavior.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s obvious also, and that &#8220;racism&#8221; is exactly the set of natural and necessary values that all races have protected themselves with throughout history, but which have been hypnotized out of the white race alone for the last 60 years, to our ruination.</p>
<p>We need to quit fussing over whether or not this natural racial armor is morally certified, and put it back on before we&rsquo;ve fussed ourselves out of existence.</p>

<p>As you say, there are very few young people like yourself. I will suggest that you can start by being a letter to the editor writer. That way, you&rsquo;ll get our message out. Of course, you must learn a way of writing that will get past the censors at the newspapers so you&rsquo;ll be able to get your letter published. I&rsquo;ve discovered that if you couch your thoughts in question form (isn&rsquo;t it reasonable), many times the censors will let the thought pass.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, when the final break comes and your generation has to step forward and do the dirty work, you&rsquo;ll be proud of your young men. No matter how they look today, when the chips are down, they&rsquo;re going to astound the world. I promise you.</p>

		<p>I grew up in a working class neighborhood of Chicago.  There were Blacks on the eastern part of the &#8216;ward&rsquo;  but they didn&rsquo;t cross into the white part.  We were separated by a viaduct and the railroad tracks, so my exposure to them was slight.  A couple of years out of high school I landed a job as a salesman for a well known tool company, and my territory was the Mid-South.  I traveled thru there in 1955/56 and when I first encountered the segregation in tht part of the country I felt sorry for the blacks living there.  They had to drink out of black only water fountains, use a separate entrance to the local movie house, etc.  I guess you&rsquo;d say I was kind of liberal at that time.  I had never seen such squalor in some of the towns I went thru but even then the white working class didn&rsquo;t have it much better I thought.  Maybe there should have been a kind of a &#8216;Marshall Plan&rsquo; after the War Between the State&rsquo; at that point, and maybe things wouldn&rsquo;t have turned out the way they have.</p>
<p>My first real exposure to Blacks came when I was drafted into the U.S. Army.  In Basic Training we had a couple of Black drill sargeants, and I kind of felt that they didn&rsquo;t like whites all that much.  One of them would make degrading remarks to us at formation in the morning but nobody really complained.  I often felt we had a right to do it but I was also afraid of the wrath that might follow.  One of the Black drill sargeants said to another Black, &#8220;We have rubber stamps that say &#8220;Accidental Death.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Things changed for me after the race riots in the 1960&rsquo;s in Chicago.  They burned down the West Side of the city and it still looks like Berlin after the Second World War today.  I thought Blacks would calm down after they received their Civil Rights along with the affirmative action policies and racial set-asides that they have received and are still receiving after all of these years but that isn&rsquo;t the case.  They have taken most of the good paying city, State and Federal jobs now.  Promotions were passed out mainly on account of race.  If you were a non-White you could be assured of an increase in pay grade even if you couldn&rsquo;t do the job.  I&rsquo;m sure there is something to the charge that Blacks have a lower IQ than whites after working with them for over 25 years as I&rsquo;ve seen it myself.  Case in point, a Black woman employee sends a letter to a deceased citizen even though she is holding his Death Certificate in her hand.  Her explantion was convoluted that I had a headache after hearing it.  The union that represented us made it a point that they would not stand up for white workers who put in a complaint about &#8220;reverse discrimination.&#8221; My attorney informed me about this when I was contemplating a lawsuit regarding a promotion I was denied.  </p>
<p>When I tell my retired friends about how whites are being treated as second class citizens in obtaining city jobs they just shrugg it off.  It is as if they don&rsquo;t want to think about such things.  We live in an almost white neighborhood full of Liberal thinkers and politicians.  It is very difficult to see these young white males, most with college educations, working in low paying jobs, while these good paying City, State, and Government jobs go to the less qualified minorities, (illegals too) but there are no champions rising to their aid.  Mayor Daley has stated that he is 100% for affirmative action, and will continue these policies that permit a developing white underclass in Chicago.</p>

		<p>My story is rather different from all the others I see here because it happened when I was so much younger. I grew up in south Texas, and my family had a black maid, Thelma. Thelma was a happy-go-lucky sort, married with two legitimate children and at least one illegitimate child. He husband was a drunk, and they lived in the black part of town. She came to our home several days a week to clean and often took care of my sister and me when we were very small children (under 10).</p>
<p>I recall a number of tales that Thelma told about her life that absolutely amazed me, they were so very different from the way we lived. One that sticks in my mind is the way she would punish her son, Stanley Jr. She would wait until he was asleep and then whip him with an electrical cord. She said it was the only way she could spank him because he was too big and strong for her otherwise. I was horrified, but she said about that and numerous other things, &#8220;Black folks are different from white folks.&#8221; She was right about that. She said this over and over about all sorts of things she told me about the way they lived. She was not bitter about her life in the least; she just recognized that there were great differences.</p>
<p>Through most of my time in public school, we had segregated schools. The black high school was Solomon Cole H.S., and we all knew that their diploma was at best equivalent to completing 8th grade. But that was what they were capable of, that was what they were comfortable with, they were satisfied with that sort of education. Life was peaceful because the races were not forced to compete educationally. Those very few blacks who wanted higher education managed to achieve it, such as Thomas Sowell, but they were very, very few who wanted this. </p>
<p>This is the era that is now looked on with such scorn as &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221; but it was actually a period of rather good race relations, vastly better than what exists today. During this time, the black family was largely intact, the black Church was quite effective, black men were working and providing for their families, and blacks as a whole were vastly better off than they are today. They lived in the shelter of white society, rather than trying to tear down the house.</p>
<p>When I completed a PhD and began to look for a teaching position, I saw my own university, which had an absolutely rigid rule about not hiring its own graduates, deviate to hire some of their own black, but less qualified, PhD graduates to satisfy Affirmative Action in the late 1960s. I could see right away where this was going, and I was entirely correct that it was reverse discrimination in its most blatant form. I have seen this sort of reverse discrimination over and over throughout my career, where the less qualified black is chosen without even a look at the more qualified white candidates. (And if it is a black woman, no one else need bother to apply!)</p>

Otherwise, you learn to keep your silence.   </p>
<p>If, however, you do speak out, then to all others (who haven&rsquo;t had the enlightening experience), you&rsquo;re just a contemptible &#8220;racist&#8221; bigot.

Mr. Dumpty is quite right.   We have become obsessed with hair-splitting and fussing over  the morality of  &#8220;racism&#8221; and such.  But all of our moral concern has been about OTHERS.   Do we count for nothing?   Do we have no rights of our own?   </p>

They support my belief that only personal experience can overcome the daily propaganda and brainwashing white youths are subjected to, but it takes time.

<p>Unless one actually experiences life in a black community or organization, he really can&rsquo;t comprehend how terrible it is to be among them. </p>

		<p>While I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself a &#8220;red diaper baby&#8221; like Mike Berman, I too was raised in a typically liberal, democratic, agnostic/Jewish household in suburban Maryland.  I grew up in a heavily Jewish neighborhood and went to an almost all-white elementary school.  It was in junior high that I first encountered large groups of blacks - just as others have related - harassing whites, congregating in hallways, setting up a no-go area in the lunchroom.  My high school had fewer blacks and the only one I had any real contact with was the sole black in any of my academically-advanced classes.  During all these years, I remained a liberal in all my attitudes,despite remembering my father unable to go to work in D.C. due to the riots, and avidly watched the Nixon impeachment hearings while loudly proclaiming my political and cultural leanings. </p>
<p>I went to Smith College and while I remained a liberal, subconsciously things were slowly sinking in.  I met openly lesbian women for the first time, some more militant than others.  I dealt with few blacks - they were a distinct minority and most chose to live together in a few specific houses - and those who didn&rsquo;t choose to self segregate were ostracized.  I also met, for the first time, prep school students - classic &#8220;WASPS,&#8221; and mentally contrasted their demeanor with that of the wealthy Californian Jews I encountered. I developed friendships with the first evangelical Christians I had ever really known, and contrasted their behavior and open welcome of me, despite my anti-Christian attitudes, with the clannishness of the Jews and their narrowness of thought. I got to know Texans and Southerners: unfailingly friendly, warm, gracious, intellectually curious, and conservative.  I was fortunate to get mostly old-school professors and a truly classical liberal arts education - where I first became aware of the Bible (and my utter ignorance of it) as a source for all great English literature and indeed Western civilization.</p>
<p>It was really after college, when I received a Fulbright scholarship to England, that I began to change.  To my English flatmates I was an oddity, an &#8220;American,&#8221; and I began to examine our differences from that perspective - and religion didn&rsquo;t come into it.  I mentioned once, in the midst of an antisemitic joke - which I laughed at too - that I was Jewish, and my friends were shocked.  When I reminded them of the menorah I had (sentimentally) lit months previously, they simply said they had wondered what an American was doing observing a Jewish custom.  This was a real revelation to me - I didn&rsquo;t have to be even culturally Jewish or be defined by my parents&rsquo; religion. I also became acquainted with muslim Malaysians and the British disdain for them - which I came to share - and Pakistanis, and African blacks.  I met a few people with mixed British/American parents, and began to examine what made one an American - and what mattered to me, my identity, and what I might one day pass on to my children.  I spent a week in Berlin, both West and East, and really got to pondering what political beliefs led to in real life terms.</p>
<p>Things crystallized when, after England, I lived in Moscow for a year as a nanny to a British family.  This was under Brezhnev (no glasnost yet) and I had minored in Russian civilization in college and spoke, albeit poorly and ungrammatically, the language. I met U.S. marines, Seabees, and Texas contractors supervising the Russians building our new and heavily-bugged embassy, and celebrated a new-found patriotism - neither jingoistic nor reflexive, but carefully thought out and heartfelt.</p>
<p>When I returned to the U.S. I got a job with the &#8220;Grace Commission,&#8221; as the President&rsquo;s Private Sector Survey on Cost Control in the Federal Government was known (jobs in my academic field were highly specialized and poorly paid) and got to know Republicans and businessmen.  I lived in a borderline area of D.C. and got mugged by a couple of black guys entering my apartment building (I consciously and deliberately ignored my instincts telling me they were dangerous - my last remnants of liberal teachings overriding common sense).  I registered to vote, for the first time, (little too young in 1976 and overseas in 1980) as a Republican in 1984.  I was in graduate school at the time, and remember being struck by how the majority of foreign-born students supported Reagan, and the American-born (all foreign-service wannabes) despised him.  A number of years in the Foreign Service followed and experience piled on experience. To cut short what is becoming an overly-long recitation of my life, I became a fully-committed conservative (still called myself a Republican), a race realist, and a Christian.</p>
<p>I now find myself tarred by my government as &#8220;dangerous&#8221; and a &#8220;radical right-wing extremist.&#8221;  My Christian husband and I have raised our children to be American and Christian and to celebrate both as their heritage - regardless of their mixed European/religious ancestry.  I, too, have read many of the books others have commented on, and I also continually despair at the willful blindness of most whites - indeed most Christians - to the decay of our culture and the destruction of our nation, and the undeniable racial aspects of it. While I suppose to other Jews I might look somewhat Jewish, I have fair skin and a modest nose. Habits ingrained throughout childhood (speaking too loudly, interrupting others) are damned hard to break - but I readily identify them as remnants of my Jewish past and in Christ I am a new creation.  I suppose other readers might reject me due to my &#8220;Jewish blood,&#8221; but I claim as my ancestors, both philosophically and religiously, our Founding Fathers.  I would argue I deserve neither condemnation nor celebration as a Jew who found both Christ and conservatism - truly I am more humbled than anything by the gifts I have received.  Other Jews who have come even part of the way on this journey like to trumpet their &#8220;triumph over adversity&#8221; or their &#8220;seeing the light.&#8221;  That screams reinventing the wheel and &#8220;JEWISH ARROGANCE&#8221; to me.  I am deeply grateful for the privilege of being an American and the undeserved grace of being saved by Christ.</p>

		<p>As another young&rsquo;un (I&rsquo;ll be 21 on the 21st of this month), I wonder if it&rsquo;s a telling sign that none of these stories shock me.  My brother alone has been mugged three times by blacks in the last two years, twice at gun point. </p>
<p>I myself first became racially aware when I started becoming interested in crime statistics after reading a news article online about racial disparities in crime.  It was pretty obvious to me that the huge disparity could not be explained away by &#8216;culture&rsquo; or &#8216;evil white racism,&rsquo; which in turn led to me becoming a lot more interested in the subject of race.</p>

		<p>I grew up in Detroit during the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; era (early 1960&rsquo;s).  Even back then, the catholic school that I attended trotted out &#8220;civil rights&#8221; workers that attempted to teach about all the &#8220;injustices&#8221; that blacks endured.  The &#8220;civil rights&#8221; worker&rsquo;s speech would have worked; however, living in an &#8220;integrated&#8221; neighborhood proved otherwise.  Being a white kid, one had to be aware of two blacks riding one bicycle; One pedaling and the other on the handlebars.  Upon seeing a white kid, the one on the handlebars would jump off, knock the white kid off his bicycle and take it.  We knew where the thieves lived, their &#8220;parents&#8221; would deny that their &#8220;kid&#8221; stole the bike.  Quite often the bike would be right there; the parent(s) would dare the white kid (or his parents) to &#8220;take it&#8221;.  <br>
Many years later, talking with black acquaintances, they would LAUGH when these childhood situations were brought up.  They would admit to it or state that they knew the person(s) who did this.  To them, it was &#8220;no big deal&#8221;.<br>
It is easy for older adults to share the knowledge about growing up with blacks.  However, young (white) people think that any talk of negative experiences with blacks is &#8220;racist&#8221;; they need to FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES.</p>

		<p>I can sympathize with these stories. I never was a liberal, but I grow more and more race conscience the older I get. </p>
<p>It really started in school. Even though I grew up in rural Alabama in the early 1970s, were you would expect blacks would have yet to dominate, the few blacks that were integrated in our schools took over quickly making the whites cower in fear. The school was about 60/40 with whites in the majority. I was constantly harassed for my lunch money or to allow them to cheat from my school work. I have great disdain for blacks. I realize we cannot live together in peace.</p>
<p>My big question is, why do whites cower in fear?</p>

		<p>First of all let me say that I sympathize with what the above people went through until it finally dawned on them that they had been accepting nothing more, nothing less, than abject propaganda.</p>
<p>But I laughed many times during my reading of their experiences and gradual transformation.  Why?  Because it seems to have taken some pretty horrific examples for them to wake up to reality.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve endured almost exactly the same propaganda and brainwashing techniques they have, yet I&rsquo;ve never bought it.  I was less enthusiastically anti-black than I am now at one time, but there&rsquo;s no way I ever believed blacks weren&rsquo;t a criminal class with less intelligence.</p>
<p>That may sound conceited, but it&rsquo;s not, because I believe there are MANY whites besides myself who are hard to fool.  However, I also firmly believe that we have a hardcore group of whites who are just naturally naive and gullible. They&rsquo;re not necessarily less intelligent in an academic sense, but they ARE more prone to accepting things that do not square with reality, especially a good number of our women.</p>
<p>And that one single fact, along with too much altruism, has been a deadly weakness for us and has brought us much misery and turmoil.</p>

<p>There was a &#8216;plan&rsquo; by the Yankee government and the Union Army after the WBTS.  The &#8216;plan&rsquo; by said government and the northeastern industrialists that ran it was a foot on the head, forced economic discriminations out of retribution that meant that the South had no manufacturing and industrial economy to speak of for a century or more after the end of the WBTS.  In fact it was so bad that Missouri, which was heavily pro-Confederate outside of St. Louis (St. Louis was heavily pro-Union), and whose legally elected government did secede, but was overthrown by Union guns, and the legit government took exile in Texas, was also forced to pay for its &#8220;perfidy&#8221; this way   &mdash;   Because St. Louis was the river town in the West, it would have been logical to route the transcontinental E-W railroad through St. Louis.  But doing that would have meant that it would have to go through pro-Confederate Missouri, and the industrialists had no part of that.  So the Union Pacific went through Chicago and Iowa (Iowa is basically a New England state, its founding whites were New England egalitarian farmers; it is not a surprise to me that IA&rsquo;s Supreme Court voted for gay &#8220;marriage&#8221;), and the UP avoided MO altogether.  The Eads bridge across the Mississippi river in St. Louis was opened in 1874, but it was a big time money loser for its first few decades because of the Yankee/industrialist contempt for MO.  Even the railroad that went from Mississippi to Chicago, which aided in the south-to-north &#8220;great migration&#8221; of blacks between the World Wars, did not enter MO; the closest it got is East St. Louis (many of the &#8220;great migrators&#8221; who did not have the money to go all the way to Chicago settled for ESL, and the rest is history).  You had to catch a separate train from ESL to cross to St. Louis.</p>

		<p>The grade school that I went to in San Francisco was as multicultural and integrated as you could get, it was 30% black, 30% Mexican, and the rest white.It may be hard for anyonme reading this to believe, but racial conflict there was unheard of.When I got into Junior High School, the same one that OJ Simpson went to, the true nature of blacks began to show itself.The blacks there were raised in the city, and they were nowhere as well behaved as the blacks, most of who were from the South, were in my grade school.My last tear in Jr High was really hell for me, because of all of the anti white propaganda being hurled at them from bolth whites and blacks, which caused them to hate us so much. I remember all of the race related killings that I would read about in the newspapers every morning in the late 1970s,and the papers would always downplay the racial motives behind them. The Zebra Murders that happened a few years earlier  had a big impact on me.But the biggest factor was what blacks did after the acquittal of double killer OJ Simpson.

		<p>I could accept it all, even though I&rsquo;m a bit high strung and angry - racist I suppose. I could accept it all, even perhaps, accept how the perception is always - how those in power, always blame whites for all the racism and hate - even in schools where it&rsquo;s so obviously the other way around. I could accept it all - for I personally had never been completely maimed or completely bankrupted, at least not monitarily, be the ordeal. I couldn&rsquo;t take it all (and it was a lot to bear), and every girl in the neighborhood going out with only black guys. </p>

		<p>Great forum subject.<br>
I grew up being realistic about race. I started school in around 1948 and for several years I was the only white kid in the school. In those days I had no problem. Intellectually the kids were zeros. We used the Dick and Jane books. I found myself pretty much self taught as to reading. Those kids read the simple books (and they put me, a second grader in a sixth grade class for reading) like I would read Chinese.<br>
Later, I went to some other schools with varying proportions of blacks. The key is &#8220;critical mass&#8221;. When blacks were a small minority, they get along well; you know the bit, they get elected as class president- that sort of thing. But&hellip; when a certain proportion of blacks is present, then the trouble begins.<br>
I recall a junior high I went to where they sold milk for two cents. Like locusts, the black kids went around asking for &#8220;you got two cents?&#8221;. Another thing was that if a white kid said he had no money, the demand was made &#8220;All I find I keep?&#8221;. Very agressive, although I saw little if any actual violence. But a lot of intimidation. I just brought my own lunch and never, never, never carried money. <br>
Even after we moved away from the black area, I used to visit my grandmother all the time, and I rode my bicycle through what would be like a real ghetto area. This was around 1957 and I had no problem doing this. <br>
Everything changed after Lyndon Johnson and his so called War on Poverty. Things changed almost overnight. Then came the riots of the mid late sixties and the dangerous attitude in black areas. <br>
My general takeaway is this: There are two kinds of blacks. First are the black professionals. I don&rsquo;t care if its a judge, a lawyer, a garbage man, a retail clerk, whatever, just someone doing their job and minding their own business. These are decent folks and I know and respect a lot of them. Particularly blacks who wear wedding rings (something I pay attention to as an indicator of proper family behavior). The second kind though, are the professional blacks. These are people who are black (or for that matter, hispanic, gay, whatever) for a living. This is what they do: be black and in everyone&rsquo;s face. I have no use for this type.<br>

		<p>In the mid 70s, my high school principal, who had previously been a principal at a mostly black elementary school, told me that the black kids were as nice as could be up until about the fifth grade, and only became increasingly troublesome after that.  </p>
<p>I remember reading that up until the age of 9 or 10, children think that they can learn to do anything if they try hard enough and practice hard enough, but that after the age of 9 or 10, they realize that talent counts for a LOT, and that lots of people are never going to be any good at playing the piano, or painting, etc., no matter how much they work at it, while others pick up certain skills with very little effort.  </p>
<p>I think the public school propaganda of &#8220;You can be an astronaut or a doctor or President if you work hard&#8221; keeps the kiddies content through the lower grades, especially because the kids can see themselves learning new skills like cursive writing, memorizing the times tables, etc.  But after the fourth or fifth grade, the black kids are hopelessly behind the white kids, and it can&rsquo;t be covered up anymore.  At that point, forcing the black kids to attend school year after year and be subjected to endless chirpy peptalks about how they have to go to college or their lives won&rsquo;t be worth living causes them to lose all hope for their future, and the bad behavior starts to skyrocket.  </p>
<p>Personally, I think the younger generation currently attending integrated schools may catch on quicker than many think.  The schools are now under pressure to expel the same percentage of white kids as minority kids.  So white kids are being expelled WHEN BLACK/HISPANIC KIDS BEAT THEM UP.  The minority aggressor may also be expelled, but the victim is treated as a co-aggressor in order to make the statistics look better.  This has got to go a long way toward undoing years of Diversity Propaganda.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip; I am a young, early 20-something year old female, so it would be nice to hear from some younger gals like me, if there are any out there&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am surprised that you haven&rsquo;t heard more stories of anti-White racism from your cohorts  &mdash;  maybe they are afraid to speak up or believe they deserve the mistreatment?  After all, your generation is facing the brunt of anti-White multi-culturalism  as you are locked out of jobs, and you watch as non-Whites with far lesser qualifications are hired instead of you for your desired careers.</p>
<p>My daughter recently had to swallow the bitter pill of anti-White racism when, as Salutatorian of her high school with SAT scores in the 99th percentile and scores of 5&rsquo;s on her APs, she was locked out of all of the ivies and several other first-rate universities  &mdash;  because she is White.  She couldn&rsquo;t figure out what she had done wrong  &mdash;  before that, she had been impervious to my lectures about anti-White racism.  Not anymore.  I told her she&rsquo;d better get used to racial rejection because there will be a lot more coming her way.</p>
<p> She had to swallow her tears as non-Whites with far lesser class rankings were accepted at these same universities with far lower test scores and far lesser academic achievements  &mdash;  and they were offered full scholarships including travel expenses, living expenses and pocket money as well.</p>
<p>I became a race realist when I was assigned to work in an inner-city black school in Los Angeles in another life I&rsquo;d like to forget.  I wasn&rsquo;t there to save blacks, as other clueless Whites were.  I needed a job, I needed it immediately and working at Barnes and Nobles was not an option for me as I had a family to support.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had never much been around blacks and had been repeatedly told at the university and ed school that they were the same as anyone else and it was due to White racism that they weren&rsquo;t successful in school.</p>
<p>I found out quickly that I had been told lies, lies, lies.</p>
<p>Geez, what a wake-up call! My first day at the school,  I was instantly struck by the large number of students who spent the day wandering the campus aimlessly and no one did a thing about it.  In the classroom, I learned quickly that even though I was in a high school, the vast majority of the students read at about a third or fourth grade level with writing levels even lower  &mdash;  they couldn&rsquo;t understand a word of the mandated text books, and they weren&rsquo;t interested in learning or improving themselves.  </p>
<p>School was about eating, cutting up, yelling and giving &#8216;shout outs&rsquo; to their friends, showing off their name-brand athletic shoes or bling and harassing adults.  It was not possible to correct their behavior without being called a racist  &mdash;  if a black tried to correct them, they&rsquo;d shout &#8221; Mr. X doesn&rsquo;t want to help his own!&#8221;</p>
<p>Students refused to do classwork or homework, were loud, belligerent, surly, angry, had short attention spans, and were quick to resort to outright violence.  They were incredibly disrespectful toward adults and knew we were powerless to do anything about their aberrant behavior.  More than once I was called a White b**** or MF  without anything being done about it.<br>
  <br>
All of them were given free breakfasts and lunches, lived in Section 8 housing and received welfare and food stamps  &mdash;  yet they tore up the textbooks, vandalized the school, ripped up the landscaping, broke windows, destroyed the bathroom fixtures, urinated anywhere and everywhere, stole anything that wasn&rsquo;t locked down.  </p>
<p>At teachers&rsquo; meetings and professional developments, all of this was blamed on White racism, White oppression and the legacy of slavery.  I&rsquo;m not kidding.  The dismal test scores were blamed on White teaching methods that blacks couldn&rsquo;t relate to. It was never ever ever the fault of blacks who are disinterested, disengaged, and outright hostile to the educational process.  </p>
<p>As bad as the students were, the vast majority of the black adults who worked in the school were a thousand times worse.  Many were just seething with hatred and anger at Whites.  I saw them get away with things that would have gotten a White teacher fired  &mdash;  arriving an hour late to work everyday,  sitting in the teachers&rsquo; lounge during class, taking the kids out to the athletic field every day and just letting them hang out, leaving an hour early, calling in sick for weeks on end.  Many could not pass the required state teachers&rsquo; test (CBEST), a 6th grade level math/English exam, yet were allowed to stay on for years with special waivers.  </p>
<p>One black teacher was caught in an after-hours robbery of computers at a former school.  This was told to me by a White school police officer who was absolutely shocked when he saw this same teacher working at a new school  &mdash;  he was sure she&rsquo;d been fired.</p>
<p>The black teachers and other school employees complained constantly about Whites and their &#8216;special privileges&rsquo; and how White schools were so much better funded (when in fact it&rsquo;s just the opposite with massive Title I funds poured into blacks schools).  I constantly heard, &#8220;If this waz a White school&hellip;.&#8221;  They also believe that Whites and especially Asians cheat to get  where they are and get up every morning and make plans as to how to keep blacks down.</p>
<p>I saw these same teachers win award after award at the school and district level.  It was unbelievable.  In fact, in the nine years I was there, I never saw one White teacher win even one single award.  Not One.</p>
<p>I also found out that as a White, I was not allowed to transfer out of that pest-hole for at least seven years  &mdash;  I was classified as some kind of &#8216;Urban Needs Teacher.&rsquo;  I learned later I was needed to keep enough Whites in the school for the district racial head count.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was able to escape after a White principal was hired to bring &#8216;order&rsquo; to the school. He surreptitiously, through his connections, found jobs in better schools for most of the White teachers and a few non-racist hispanic teachers in the two years he was there, including me.  I owe him a pound of flesh as my life became immeasurably better when I was allowed to transfer to a school with no blacks.</p>
<p>To this day I am wary of blacks and remember the anti-White hatred I experienced and how poorly I and other Whites were treated by the adult blacks at my school site.  They pontificated loudly and constantly about evil Whites and believed all black problems were caused somehow by racist Whites  &mdash;  and that Whites must be harshly punished and made to pay for their perceived sins.</p>
<p>Now, I am a race realist, as is every other White teacher I know that&rsquo;s taught black students, some are virulently anti-black.  They may not be able to say these things out loud but they do behind closed doors in the company of friends.</p>
<p>I believe the races will never be able to live together in peace and that we should be allowed to separate ourselves and be left alone by the government. </p>

		<p>What did it for me was oddly enough as a teenager in the 70s to constantly notice in the Nba and major league baseball fights were started by blacks.I noticed white players would not fight back. I was old enough to realize their passive nature was being taken advantage of. Then the 1992 LA riots and the OJ Verdict sealed the deal.I have 3 teenagers now and many worrisome hours are spent over fears of rapes, carjackings,etc&hellip;when they are out at night. Three of my kids friends have had guns to their heads. My father was a WW2 paratrooper and never had a gun to his head.I feel there is an unreported internal war happening here in America.I despise black culture but am a practicing Christian and pray incessantly for God to soften my heart.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The grade school that I went to in San Francisco was as multicultural and integrated as you could get, it was 30% black, 30% Mexican, and the rest white.It may be hard for anyonme reading this to believe, but racial conflict there was unheard of.&#8221;</p>
<p>I grew up in Detroit, near John PM (I don&rsquo;t know him, but he seems to have lived close by to me and we are about the same age), and my grade school was very ethnically diverse with many Black students.  It was a small parochial grade school run by the Catholic Church and all of the students knew each other very well.  There was no racial conflict even though White students were less than one-third of the student body.  I went to a nearly all-White high school after that and then to a mostly White four-year university.  </p>
<p>One of the factors that caused me to think about racial differences and White racial consciousness was the racial animosity I found among non-Whites (not just Blacks) in college and also the doctrine of political correctness that I encountered among the professors.  More important in this process, however, were several violent incidents by Blacks against family members and friends (like Mike Berman, one of my close relatives was raped by Blacks).  </p>
<p>As has been pointed out repeatedly in this post and its comments, many Whites never think about anti-White racism because they have very little contact with non-Whites.  AmRen serves an important function in that we can discuss our experiences and show Whites living in a homogeneous environment what is waiting for us in the future if Whites become a minority.</p>

		<p>For me the cracks in the multi-cult brainwashing occured when I moved to Europe while in my mid-20&rsquo;s.  I was raised in all white communities in the mid-west and northeast and attended all white schools (including college) and had no real life experience with any minority.  I studied political science in College and fully accepted the liberal reasoning for the failure of black society; legacy of slavery, jim crow, colonialism, etc. </p>
<p>I moved to a European, German speaking city of 750K people that had a metro area population of 1.5 million; similar in size to Baltimore (where I had moved from).  But there was something I noticed&hellip;&hellip;  there were no slums, no no-go areas, the city was clean and safe.  I could go anywhere at any time of the day or night with out fear of my personal safety.  I started to wonder WHY?  Afterall, if it was the &#8216;urban environment&rsquo; that caused social ills why were none of the negative pathologies of American cities evident in this European city?  The only difference I could determine was the actual population of the cities them selves! There were NO blacks or minorities living here!   </p>
<p>mmmmm&hellip;..</p>
<p>In the intervening years, I have completely shed my childhood, liberal, multi-cult socialization and have developed a realistic attitude towards race, political correctness and society in general. </p>
<p>Race IS NOT a social construct.  Society IS a racial construct.</p>

		<p>With me, it was just an accumulation of the obvious. Blacks don&rsquo;t do anything right and if they see a fellow black trying to do the right thing, they &#8220;correct&#8221; him right away. I had a young black guy on the job up in Harlem and he was good. Even at lunch time, he had lunch with us and talked about the work. One day he was eating with the black guys and he said they told him to eat with them. Then I didn&rsquo;t see the guy for a number of years and when I did, he was just as messed up as the rest of them. That&rsquo;s just the way it is with blacks. They always gravitate to the lowest point.</p>
<p>All any reasonable person has to do is watch a black guy &#8220;walk&#8221; down the street and you can see they&rsquo;re not up to much. It&rsquo;s really something, that ridiculous &#8220;stroll&#8221; they&rsquo;ve perfected that tells anyone what to expect from them. </p>
<p>Also though, when I read these posts, what I get is that many Amreners don&rsquo;t seem to understand where this is all going. This is not an intellectual exercise we&rsquo;re engaged in here. This is life and death serious talk. Make no mistake about it. In the end, blacks are going to go stark raving mad under the pressure of always having to make up stories for their shortcomings and finally go after White people hook line and sinker. It&rsquo;s going to be an all out rampage across the country in my estimation. Then is when you&rsquo;re going to see what White men are really made of. Even the ones who think of themselves as quasi women will finally step up. When that happens, black people will finally understand the error of their ways. But it&rsquo;ll be too late for them by then. Too bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my belief that one determined White man is as good or better than ten or possibly more black men any day of the year.</p>
<p>As far as the hispanics are concerned, we&rsquo;ll take care of them in the process as well. Things will be alright for us in the end, but it&rsquo;ll be a hard grind while we go about the ugly business of putting things right in our country.</p>

		<p>Where I grew up in Australia in late 60s early 70s there were very few black people around and it was indeed quite common to hear a cry from my grandparents and mum  that if you didnt behave `the black man would get you`!<br>
Hence due to the above fact `the black man ` was definitely not  African but rather some ghastly figure dressed in black<br>
a la `Men in Black`  who would whisk you of somewhere never again to be seen by your loved ones.<br>
 My own racial awakening  came travelling across the USA and seeing blacks behaving totally different to the way they were portrayed in TV and movies and that if I followed my liberal <br>
bleeding heart I would myself quickly become another bleeding<br>
statistic as I trudged  through the Bowery of New York and Tenderloin area of San Francisco during the mid 80s.<br>
 While I was most fortunate not to suffer any of the assaults and indignities etc of other readers I learnt very quickly and thanks<br>
to the modern wonder of an Internet not largely bound by political correctness, I found Amren.(Although I knew of Jared<br>
Taylor through books he has written about Japan,another fascinating study in race and human achievement).<br>
 While I have met a few blacks over the year who I could consider to be decent,well read and conscientious they have been way in the minority.Howvever its this very fact that keeps a large section of whites from really following their instinct as they feel that to be a race realist is to be racist which is to be prejudicial to the those few  good black or other minority folk out there trying to make a decent living out there in the big wide `white` world.Maybe  this distorted  altruism or  `anti racism gene` is one  many whites share and which<br>
has been nurtured and conditioned by the mass media for over half a century and led to the new taboo on frank discusssion of racial differences .Whether its USA,Australia,Japan or wherever its patently obvious if you radically alter the demographics of an area or nation you also drastically change socio cultural and economic circumstances which is what I think is the central message of this website.                  </p>

		<p>There are some very interesting stories here about how whites were racially tuned-in. I was also one of them when I was a dumb young, impressionable white kid, many decades ago. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to figure out that I was being lied to by self destructive liberal fools, and others with a more nefarious agenda! I have since supported the white racial cause any way that I realistically can.</p>
<p>What truly amazes me is how, in the current advanced state of racial decay, any sane and sensible white person can possibly believe in the ludicrous MSM (system propaganda) of RACE Denial. How many racial &#8220;lessons&#8221; do white people need, in order to consciously resist their looming genocide? Are they really that psychologically paralyzed and blindsided? Sadly, perhaps so.</p>
<p>It should be clear to any sentient white person by now, that we are living under a hijacked system of State Sponsored Dysgenics. Until the racial and economic pain becomes unbearable, and obvious racial/political Bolshevism oppresses them, I wonder if the brainwashed whites will ever leave the &#8216;shelter&rsquo; of their star spangled fantasies and delusions.</p>

<p>Years ago I occasionally tutored black students at heavily black Catholic schools out here in Berkeley/Oakland, Ca., and I got the feeling that their parents were of a different sort than most&hellip;they cared enough, and had the means, to send their kids to a disciplined school.</p>
<p>I was a racial idiot at the time, and was bewildered by the inability of the few such students I got to do anything except memorize. I got the strong impression that the schools weren&rsquo;t much academically (it was Jr. High and High School level).</p>

		<p>I think it was around the time I went to a multi-racial high school with forced integration that I started to become racially conscious. I grew up in a town that is very liberal, where blacks and Latinos have been bussed to our public schools for the past 20 years or so. In fact, my town is pretty much the liberal capital of the state, and it&rsquo;s also a place where the white and Asian kids tend to be high-performers and even over-achievers. That&rsquo;s what made it more starkly obvious to me that blacks will never be interested in performing at the same levels as whites.</p>
<p>The logic behind the county&rsquo;s decision to have these black slackers come to our schools was that they&rsquo;d be motivated to work harder if placed in an environment that encouraged learning. Of course, it didn&rsquo;t take a genius to see how this turned out. There was extreme racial segregation amongst the students, as whites and Asians kept away from blacks, who kept away from Latinos, etc. Blacks were always found disproportionately in the lower-level courses, while whites and Asians dominated the upper-level, Honors, and AP courses. In the few classes where different races were mixed (i.e. required classes such as Health or language classes), the differences in achievement were more obvious. I remember how much I hated getting assigned to group projects and presentations with black students, because I would always expect that they would do almost none of the work, while I (and any other whites with me) would be stuck doing almost all of the work.</p>
<p>Now, as I&rsquo;ve said, I won&rsquo;t deny that the high school I attended was very competitive by anyone&rsquo;s standards. And there were plenty of white and Asian kids who were just as lazy as the blacks. But the blacks were still disproportionately represented amongst the slacker population. When it came to whites, there were only individual whites whom I didn&rsquo;t want to share a classroom with, whereas I could only find individual blacks (FEW of them) whom I didn&rsquo;t mind having in my classes. Then there&rsquo;s the fact that the blacks were just generally unpleasant in all sorts of other ways. They were noisy, constantly made messes, seemed inconsiderate of anyone besides themselves. I would not enjoy being in the presence of whites who acted this way, but the difference is, I have yet to meet very many whites who are so ill-behaved and rude, whereas it seemed as though every black at my high school fit this description.</p>
<p>I really would like to believe, as I once did, that all races really are exactly the same and that we can all just get along, but I remain unconvinced that this is possible.</p>

		<p>In Los Angeles, 1964, at the age of seven, I was beaten bloody by an eleven year-old African sixth-grader for refusing to move off the sidewalk in front of his house and walk in the street.  The following day my folks made a stink and the school principal personally yanked me from class by the ear and into her office. In front of two other adults she forced me to say that I had called the African a &ldquo;n_gg_r&rdquo; – a word I had never heard before – by threatening to have me taken by the police to Juvenile Hall for not &ldquo;telling the truth.&rdquo;  My childhood trust of adults was gone.  That was quite alright, for in later years I learned that &ldquo;social justice&rdquo; required that this egg be broken.</p>
<p>One year later, at a school in Inglewood, I was introduced to the word &ldquo;motherf****r&rdquo; and a host of other new, &ldquo;mind-expanding&rdquo; terminology.  I saw white teachers turn aside – literally, walk away – when packs of African &ldquo;students&rdquo; sexually molested white girls and beat down white boys to bloody pulps.  I learned to fight &ldquo;dirty,&rdquo; with weapons when necessary.  When attacked by an African pack, I used small cushioned pad locks as &ldquo;brass knuckles,&rdquo; blackjacks, and chain until I was in a position to run like hell.  Learning that the best defense was a good offense, I put this knowledge to use against certain individuals in vicious surprise attacks.  Thus I became a &ldquo;troublemaker,&rdquo; &ldquo;bad kid,&rdquo; and &ldquo;juvenile delinquent&rdquo; with a rapidly accumulating history of school suspensions, expulsions, and legal entanglements.</p>
<p>I learned about Africans at an early age.  And Mestizos.  More important to survival in later years, however, was the hard-won knowledge that two subsets of the Caucasian race – one differentiated from me specifically by ethnicity, the other ostensibly by class – could not be trusted to safeguard my interests under any circumstances.  In a pinch, for example, Africans and Mestizos can be trusted to behave as Africans and Mestizos.  However a large subset of whites – those with whom I share ethnicity but not class – can only be trusted to follow the easiest, safest path to riches and status.  Current events and one thousand years of historical evidence support this assertion, for which I believe there are genetic reasons.  If true, then genetics makes this group impervious to persuasion by groups like American Renaissance.</p>
<p>A new approach is required.<br>

		<p>The story of how I developed a racialist consciousness is similar to many of yours. I started out as a liberal and a multiculteralist. I did not learn these ideologies at home but in school. I am in my early thirties. I grew up in Southern California. My father grew up before the countercultural revolution and so his views are those of most middle-class white Americans from the fourties and fifties. My mother, being ten years younger than my father was a product of the counterculture. She started out as a liberal who fought for desegregation and for forced bussing in the schools. As she got older and wiser experience forced her to abandon these views. She told me that when I first began elementary school, school officials would not let me be in the same class as my boyhood friend from my neighborhood because we were both white, and the school worried that we would stick together. So they put us in seperate classes that were predominantly black and hispanic. Apparently the school was not worried about them sticking together. Then the university where she worked for ten years laid her off. The reason: &#8220;she no longer reflected the color of the community.&#8221; They wanted a minority so that minority students would feel more comfortable. This brings me to my own story. I adopted the views of my teachers. I internalized all of the anti-white propoganda that passes for education. I internalized it, and gradually I began to hate my own race. I refused to date white women. I tried hard to gain acceptance from minorities. After spending time with minorities (blacks, latinos, and asians) I began to notice that they were racists as well. Not just against whites. But Latinos looked down on blacks. Asians looked down on blacks. And there were blacks who hated anyone who wasn&rsquo;t black. While my experience taught me that other people were racists, all I heard about in highschool and college was the evil of white racism. Later I took up the study of history and I discovered that many of the attrocities committed by Europeans were committed by other peoples as well. I learned that other peoples owned slaves and that other races conquered and oppressed those whom they conquered. Then I began to realise that much of what is taught in the name of history in school wasn&rsquo;t true. Yet I knew many whites who were going through the same feelings I had. When I saw that many whites prefered to associate with non-whites I understood that they had internalized the same feelings of self-loathing I had. And that is not right. Many whites do not know our own history. That is why white people, in general have no sense of community. A community is made up of a shared history and shared beliefs. I would encourage white people to study history for themselves. You will find that there is much to be proud of. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;My big question is, why do whites cower in fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cower in fear because they&rsquo;ve been conditioned to do so for at least the last half century by the major media. They&rsquo;ve been feminized by the media.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presumably you are neither conditioned nor feminized.  Men are &ldquo;feminized&rdquo; by legal and socioeconomic consequences.  Media conditioning runs a poor second to material incentives for playing the diversity game and the disincentives for not playing it.<br>

		<p>To Harumphty Dumpty,</p>
<p>&#8220;I assume the Catholic administration of the school had established real discipline and control, such as white society in general exerted (in the South at least) up until about 60 years ago. (And up until more recently in the presently unfortunate countries of South Africa and Rhodesia/Zimbabwe).</p>
<p>Years ago I occasionally tutored black students at heavily black Catholic schools out here in Berkeley/Oakland, Ca., and I got the feeling that their parents were of a different sort than most&hellip;they cared enough, and had the means, to send their kids to a disciplined school.</p>
<p>I was a racial idiot at the time, and was bewildered by the inability of the few such students I got to do anything except memorize. I got the strong impression that the schools weren&rsquo;t much academically (it was Jr. High and High School level).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to hear more about your grade school, especially the level of instruction.</p>
<p>Quite a few posts seem to be implying that black and white academic abilities are more or less equal up until about the 5th grade?&#8221;</p>
<p>You are quite right that the parents of the Black students were unusual in that they actually cared about their children&rsquo;s academic performance.  Even though they were not Catholic, most of the Black students&rsquo; parents wanted their children to attend a Catholic grade school nearby in order to avoid the warzone that is the Detroit public school system.  The Black children were still not very good students but they did managed to pass and did behave themselves.  The nuns were indifferent about color when it came to using the ruler on unruly pupils.</p>
<p>The parochial grade school was not academically difficult but still had basic standards, which is more than can be said for most public schools, even in the 1970s.</p>

<p>I think I know the reconciliation.  I think you&rsquo;re making the very debatable implication that race realism/white nationalism (I know they overlap but are not the same) automatically means you believe in racial superiority or inferiority.  </p>
<p>Race realism and any feelings of superiority/inferiority are apples and oranges because RRism is a pursuit that depends on real science and the scientific method in many disciplines:  Biology, genetics, sociology, anthropology, and a number of others.  Superiority and inferiority are subjective measures of personal opinion, and therefor have no place in science, ergo no place in RRism.</p>
<p>White nationalism isn&rsquo;t a science, but neither is it too subjective.  You can believe in white nationalism and not believe that whites are superior and other races are inferior.  As a matter of fact, many here at AR (yours truly not included) are WNs but believe as a matter of subjective opinion that Orientals are superior in certain ways.  Based on the several decades old trends, some of us think that whites are inferior, because in spite of our intelligence, (or maybe because of it), we&rsquo;re going to &#8220;diversify&#8221; and &#8220;egalitarian&#8221; ourselves out of existence.  For blacks&rsquo; low intelligence and criminal ways, (as a measure of central tendency), you know there will be black people on Earth 1,000 years from now; that you can&rsquo;t say about whites.  </p>
<p>Also, it gets down to a fundamental matter of loyalty.  I think we whites have a lot to be proud of, and innumerable civilizations-old achievements and breakthroughs representative of desirable and livable societies.  But it&rsquo;s immaterial in my mind when it comes to WNism   &mdash;   whites could be the dumbest and scummiest people on the face of the Earth, and I&rsquo;d still be a WN.  They&rsquo;re my people, not a treatise in Aristotelian logic.  End of story.</p>
<p>As an aside, the Catholic school in St. Louis were segregated until the late 1940s.  The St. Louis Archbishop before the, Cardinal John Glennon, was an out and outright seggy.  His successor, Cardinal Joseph Ritter, bought in from Indianapolis, desegged the Catholic schools in St. Louis just as he did in Indy.  So if Christianity demanded racial egaitarianism, it took Chrisendom nineteen and a half decades to figure it out.  If the nature of the Viceroy is correct, then all that happened in 1948 is that God changed His mind.  Otherwise, we&rsquo;re left with the theory that comes from my suspicious mind, that the Archdiocese in St. Louis was giving into the establishment.</p>

		<p>The top 1/4 of fourth graders can beat the lowest 1/4 of 12th graders on an achievement test, so blacks do NOT keep up with whites until the 5th grade.  But at around the time that black children get to the 5th grade, they start to truly understand that they are not &#8220;equal&#8221; academically to the white/Asian kids, and most of them completely disconnect from academics, and ruthlessly tease the black kids who do try to succeed in school.  </p>
<p>The kids with IQs below 90 should be given a solid 8th grade education, if possible, and then allowed to leave school for apprenticeships.  I have no problem with the idea of letting the ones who are interested have &#8220;high schools&#8221; with football teams and Senior Proms, etc., to give them the social experience of high school, but it should be conditioned on proper behavior.  The idea that EVERY kid in America should graduate from high school and then go on to COLLEGE has absolutely wrecked the public schools.  The kids who threaten teachers and other students should be thrown out, and people should stop worrying about whether the world has lost a brilliant brain surgeon.  The kid who could have gone to medical school has probably dropped out of school due to bullying from the kid who has been allowed to stay enrolled despite a history of violence.</p>

		<p>Thanks to all the rest of y&rsquo;all for the interesting reads.  As for me, I was brutalized for four years due to forced busing in L.A.  That left me with great bitterness toward blacks - which I spent some of my adult years trying to overcome but this experience also planted the seeds of racial awareness in my heart.  It has taken decades for me to reach true racial awareness and Amren was an important factor in this path.</p>
<p>Some have noticed that it is mainly older people who are racially aware.  This is probably due to the fact that it takes a long time (for some of us) to get past the intense indoctrination we are subject to.  Those in power (i.e. those with a lot of money) are sheltered from the ugly fruits of multiculturalism so they continue to support it.  Meanwhile, blue-collar whites bear the brunt of their experiment.  As a result, ours is a grass-root effort and each of us must promote the truth any way we can.</p>

<p>Yes, I so relate to this. I wonder what the role of Christianity is in race realism. I can see the truth about the races with my own eyes, and yet I know it&rsquo;s un-Christian to see my fellow human beings as inferior. A quandary indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps I can shed a little bit of light on this quandary.</p>
<p>Remember first of all that it was God himself who created the different races with the attributes that they have. This is not something that man created, but rather a creation of the Creator of the universe. And just as he made the leopard faster than the elephant, he made some races smarter than other races. He also gave some races greater athletic ability than others; we see the evidence of that also. The differences are God-given differences and they are real.</p>
<p>If we lived in a world where athletic skill was the dominant skill needed for survival (perhaps a world where hunting and fighting wild animals was the main activity of the day?), white people might be dependent on black people for protection. But that is not the world where we live today. We live today in a world where intellectual ability is the key to achievement, and black people are dependent on white people for protection and nurture, even though they would be humiliated to admit to such an idea. Look at the evidence: Do the American blacks want to go back to Africa where they could be &#8220;cock of the rock&#8221; so to speak with their superior American health, education, etc., or do they want to stay in the US where they can have the benefit of living under a White society? I see none going to Africa, but there are plenty in Africa that would like to come to the USA.</p>
<p>My point here for the religious concern is this: It is our duty as White people to look after the black people, much like you would care for children. Now we are not doing that very well at all when we let them take over the place. You don&rsquo;t let three year olds take over your house, but that is what we are doing. We are called to exercise a parental role over black people, caring for them because they are not capable, on the whole (allowing for isolated individual exceptions) of living in modern White society. We need a massive return to Jim Crow. </p>
<p>People will react in horror at that idea, but under Jim Crow, blacks were educated to the limits of their ability, they had work, the black family was intact, the black Church was alive, and on the whole blacks were much, much better off than they are today. They were largely treated like children, and they fared very well.</p>
<p>This is not to say we should oppress black people at all. It is to recognize their limits and care for them appropriately. We have not served them well by giving them &#8220;equality&#8221; when they are not up to handling it. We have only created frustration, anger, and resentment, and they still are not equal because they simply don&rsquo;t have the brains for it.</p>
<p>Let me add that I am an old man. I remember Jim Crow, and I remember how blacks lived at that time. There were inequities, and white people could have done better by them without a doubt. I also know that black people were reasonably happy, far more so than they are today. We have moved drastically backwards in race relations with all our efforts to move forward. </p>
<p>I am convinced we must either seize control of the situation again and reinstitute something like Jim Crow, or we must separate from the blacks completely. I look at Zimbabwe/Rhodesia and South Africa to see what would happen in an area where blacks are completely in control, and that is an awful picture. In those countries, they are killing off the white population systematically, but they are also killing huge portions of the black population as well. Blacks, by their very nature, are murderous people. When they run the show, there will be lots of deaths; that is just a given. So if we separate from them, they will fight among themselves and kill many of their own, simply because that is what they do by nature.</p>
<p>To come back to the original point: We are all part of God&rsquo;s creation, but we are not all created alike. The fiction that says we should treat every persons the same way is based on the idea that all people are exactly alike, and it simply is not true. You cannot treat them all alike because they have not been all created alike. We must treat them as they have been created. This does not relieve us of a responsibility to love them, in the sense of desiring their eternal well being. We must respect them as part of God&rsquo;s creation, and therefore treat them with respect and honor just as we would any other person, but that does not mean that we have to accede to them in terms of letting them run things. </p>

		<p>&#8220;In the end, blacks are going to go stark raving mad under the pressure of always having to make up stories for their shortcomings and finally go after White people hook line and sinker. It&rsquo;s going to be an all out rampage across the country in my estimation. Then is when you&rsquo;re going to see what White men are really made of. Even the ones who think of themselves as quasi women will finally step up. When that happens, black people will finally understand the error of their ways. But it&rsquo;ll be too late for them by then. Too bad.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Perhaps my post 34 above needs some clarification. </p>
<p>There are racial differences in the way young human beings mature, <i>relative to their own selves.</i></p>
<p>Someone much older and wiser than myself provided a great analogy, if not perfect:  A six-month old dog is, relative to the life history of a dog, more mature than a six-month old human being.  &#8220;Lower,&#8221; for lack of a better word, organisms mature more quickly, but then level off.</p>
<p>Blacks mature more quickly than whites, see Rushton to confirm.  Head Start seems to &#8220;work&#8221; because it is given to pre-K children, and in those ages, blacks tend to be equal if not a little ahead of whites in mental development.  But it won&rsquo;t take long for blacks to level off and whites to continue maturing in mental capability.  Fifth grade seems to be the turning point. Again, all these are measures of central tendency.</p>

		<p>I became a race realist after moving to an area with a large number of blacks. As is often the case in majority-black areas, Whites and Mexicans instinctively recognize that they&rsquo;re in the same boat together and stick together and watch each other&rsquo;s backs. Anyway, Mexicans are much more racially aware than whites and I learned by associating with them that I was not some horrible monster for being wary of a group of people who comprise 12% of the population but commit 50% of the crime. </p>
<p>To this day, my feelings are much more ambivalent towards Mexicans than they are towards blacks. I do not personally dislike them, and think that moderate numbers of them can probably be assimilated. However, I also feel that current immigration levels are completely unsustainable and that all Mexican immigration needs to be shut off for the foreseeable future. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Yes indeed I&rsquo;m &lsquo;racist.&rsquo;&#8221; &#8220;That&rsquo;s the natural way to be. And every race except whites are still acting naturally. That&rsquo;s why whites are going under and other races are taking over.&#8221;</p>
<p>That may be true, but by all appearances, it&rsquo;s &#8216;natural&rsquo; for whites to favor every race but their own. Also, since this is true, this is reality or whatever, does pointing it out in this manner, does it do anything other than give a bit of legitimacy to non-white racism? Also, does pointing it out do much more than say white folks, at least you, just want to be racist?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this isn&rsquo;t true, but by all evidence it&rsquo;s not true. In their natural habitat, Whites favor those who aren&rsquo;t white. They go as far as treating other whites, even hinting at racial awareness, even over murder of whites, treat them like the plague, while beaming about how articulate or whatever their non-white associates are. Just saying &#8216;we&rsquo;re all racists&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t really address the issue, and doesn&rsquo;t endear others to you.   <br>

<p>Does being related to Thomas Edison imbue you with some kind of magical powers? Do you find it helpful in your multicultural workplace? Is that what Enoch Powell talked about in his great speech? Are there bigger things to worry about, like survival? Is your magical white power really just irrelevant?</p>

		<p>I grew up in the racial DMZ of a medium-sized southern city, right on the border of gentrification.  Outside of school, I had more black friends than white.  My parents were what in retrospect I would characterize as libertarian Christians.  My father was a &#8220;cool&#8221; race realist, who like the vast majority of white men of both intelligence and long experience with blacks, simply didn&rsquo;t have the option of believing American establishment racial propaganda.  But I was not taught to feel one way or another about politics or race; I <i>was</i> taught a fierce independence and a reverence for critical thinking, a combination lethal to establishment dogmas.</p>
<p>I am taken aback by some of the anecdotes presented above.  I have been hip-deep in blacks for many years, but my experiences are a far cry from these horror stories.  I suspect this has to do with the very different racial dynamics above and below the Mason-Dixon line (e.g., it is not a coincidence that Emmit Till was a northerner).  On the other hand, I learned at an early age to give blacks a wider berth due to lower intelligence and impulse control, higher aggression, relatively absent conscience, etc.  I learned not to trust blacks overmuch, having had such trust betrayed with depressing consistency.</p>
<p>I could relate a great many anecdotes of race relations in the south (including a habit of reading film and television credits), but the long and the short of it is I learned what most southern white men learn after prolonged exposure to diversity, and by the time I was in college I was a quiet race realist and perhaps, a nascent racialist.</p>
<p>So when the Internet came along I wasn&rsquo;t inoculated against racialist material and read with interest.  It wasn&rsquo;t until the Twin Towers attacks in 2001, however, that I decided to &#8220;get to the bottom of things,&#8221; and discovered both race realism&rsquo;s dramatic predictive power, and the thoroughgoing moral, spiritual, cultural, intellectual, political and scientific bankruptcy of the liberal western zeitgeist.</p>
<p>One thing I will say to outsiders about southern white men: quiet racialism (or at least, race-realism) is, in my experience, far more common than not.  Get a few white southern men alone together and the cat is often out of the bag before you know what happened.  And I discovered this submerged race-realism to be shared amongst northerners subjected to prolonged exposure to racial reality. </p>
<p>Aldous Huxley referred in a speech to a study on hypnosis that found 20% of the population immune to it, 60% susceptible to varying degrees, and 20% defenseless against it.  It is from the first 20% of the white (particularly male) population that we will draw our strongest support; 20% of the white population is an enormous audience, and I suspect there are millions of white males in America who are but a nudge away from seeing the light, if they don&rsquo;t see it already.  Conversely, it is with the final 20% that we will contend for the hearts and minds of the remaining 60%.</p>
<p>P.S., I&rsquo;d add to the truism mentioned above - that loyalty to the multicult is correlated with distance from racial reality - that it seems to me that it is precisely the types most likely to be loyal to the multicult who are most likely to flee racial reality.  I.e., not only are these people most likely to <i>be</i> far from what they ostensibly champion, but they are most likely to <i>arrange</i> this state of affairs for themselves as well.  In any case, this correlation strikes me as a potential advantage, one that should be exploited as ruthlessly as possible.</p>

		<p><i>Superiority and inferiority are subjective measures of personal opinion, and therefor have no place in science, ergo no place in RRism.</i></p>
<p>I disagree.  Let&rsquo;s suppose for the purposes of argument that the question of superiority is subjective (I happen to agree, at least in a certain context); it does not follow that the question is unscientific!</p>
<p>Observe white behavior and create a model, note the averages and means, etc.  From these observations arise &#8220;ideals&#8221; (for lack of a better word) of nature and behavior, of being.  According to these <b>very real</b> ideals, whites are superior to non-whites.</p>
<p>One can do the same for any race, obviously, and the conclusions are the same.</p>
<p>Thus, one&rsquo;s ideal depends upon one&rsquo;s perspective, but for that is no less real or scientific.</p>
<p>Now, do I agree that this is the sort of esoterica meant for exchange between race-realists, rather than for racialist evangelism?  Yes.  But unscientific?  No.</p>
<p>Obviously the aforementioned context is vital to the discussion; leave it behind and one still has to contend with Michael Levin&rsquo;s argument (here at Amren.com), and I say good luck with that!</p>

		<p>The top 1/4 of fourth graders can beat the lowest 1/4 of 12th graders on an achievement test, so blacks do NOT keep up with whites until the 5th grade.  But at around the time that black children get to the 5th grade, they start to truly understand that they are not &#8220;equal&#8221; academically to the white/Asian kids, and most of them completely disconnect from academics, and ruthlessly tease the black kids who do try to succeed in school.  </p>
<p>The kids with IQs below 90 should be given a solid 8th grade education, if possible, and then allowed to leave school for apprenticeships.  I have no problem with the idea of letting the ones who are interested have &#8220;high schools&#8221; with football teams and Senior Proms, etc., to give them the social experience of high school, but it should be conditioned on proper behavior.  The idea that EVERY kid in America should graduate from high school and then go on to COLLEGE has absolutely wrecked the public schools.  The kids who threaten teachers and other students should be thrown out, and people should stop worrying about whether the world has lost a brilliant brain surgeon.  The kid who could have gone to medical school has probably dropped out of school due to bullying from the kid who has been allowed to stay enrolled despite a history of violence.</p>

		<p>My awakening toward blacks came as a participant in LBJ&rsquo;s great Vietnam adventure.  While my unit was 90 percent white we often linked up with other outfits that were filled with ghetto blacks.  The white officers and senior NCO&rsquo;s managed to keep things effective in these units during operations but at down times the blacks reverted to their innate nature.  White soldiers&rsquo; attitudes went quickly from amusement, to disgust to hatred. <br>
 <br>
Occasionally on operations we had a field mess brought out so we could have a few hot meals.  Blacks had the nasty habit of forming their own column at the head of the regular chow line instead of starting in back like everyone else.  This caused a lot of fights and scuffles and it could have turned deadly since all of us carried rifles and grenades.  At the time I remember thinking that not one black ever got in the end of the regular chow line as a show of decency and fair play. <br>
       <br>
Stories from these &ldquo;troubled&rdquo; outfits were replete with tales of fraggings and mutinous conduct.  Accounts were told about particularly odious blacks being suddenly assigned isolated guard posts during the night only to be found with their throats cut in the morning.  Charlie Cong was something else. <br>
  <br>
Most of the white soldiers simply developed the attitude of survival, to hell with the mission.  They did enough to stay out of trouble so they could rotate back to the world and marry a nice girl and have a family.  </p>
<p>I got out as soon as my time expired, but a couple of my buddies finished up their contract in Germany.  They came back with hellish stories of blacks going on rampages.  One particular story they told was about an Officer of the Guard (white) who went to an enlisted barracks during the dead of night to quell a race situation.  Black soldiers grabbed him and stuffed him in a wall locker. They then rolled the locker up and down the squad bay having a grand old time.  The officer was said to have survived.  I&rsquo;ve heard this tale from other ex soldiers so it may be an urban myth.  But my experience tells me otherwise.</p>
<p>One sad story concerns a family friend whose son joined the army and was killed by black &ldquo;soldiers&rdquo; while stationed in Germany.  During a barracks riot blacks seized him and threw him out an upper story window.  He died a few weeks later from head back trauma.  Although this incident occurred in the mid 70s it still saddens me a lot because I well remember the little skinny happy go lucky kid who just wanted to serve and see the world, and perhaps pick up a trade along the way.  His parents tried for years to get the army to find and convict the thugs.  The army dragged its feet so much by lying, using red tape, and simply not caring, that the kid&rsquo;s parents finally gave up and quickly withered away and died.  </p>
<p>My attitude toward blacks used to be that they are just like all descent people until they proved otherwise.   Now after years of experience my thinking has change completely.  I now see all blacks as troublemakers, criminals, and miscreants, until they prove otherwise.   Unfair?  Yes perhaps but it has come down to survival. <br>

<p>I heartily agree with this!  Education is a wonderful thing and I greatly respect it, but it can only do so much.  You can&rsquo;t turn a sow&rsquo;s ear into a silk purse, no matter how much &#8220;education&#8221; you apply.   And, in the long run, you can&rsquo;t keep a good person down either.  </p>
<p>The fashionable notion, peddled to young people today, that you can be ANYTHING you want to be if you just set your mind to it, is cruelly deceptive. I long ago faced the fact that there is no way I am going to be another Mozart, or Shakespeare, or Edison    &mdash;   no matter how resolutely I set my mind to it. A bit of talent is one thing, but genius is quite another.  You have it or you don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>A certain white person of my acquaintance, considered quite intelligent and assumed by everyone to have a college education, actually dropped out of high school as a teenager and ran away from home (due to family problems, not racial ones). He had not been abused by blacks in school, where there were none, and had no preconceptions about them at all, but first encountered them in the harsh working world that he was unavoidably  thrust into.  </p>
<p>When you lack even a HS diploma and are cut off from family backing, when you&rsquo;re washing dishes, mopping floors, or working on loading docks, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll find them   &mdash;   in low-paying, low-status jobs where it&rsquo;s dog eat dog.   Then, working with them and living among them,  he learned about black behavior the hard way. As with most of us, it was a very personal learning experience.  It&rsquo;s made  still worse when they  (blacks) are inevitably favored by certain types of bosses who look down on a white WASPY person in such a lowly job and even relish  rubbing it in,  and who will always favor a minority over a white.  Nonetheless, in the long run, this person did well in life and tells me he is now often resented (by minorities) for having been born with a silver spoon in his mouth and having had all life&rsquo;s privileges handed to him on a platter.  What a misconception!  Nothing could be further from the truth.  He had to climb up the hard way, painfully,  and do it entirely on his own.  They could have done the same. There was no &#8220;white skin privilege&#8221; there; in his case it was a handicap.</p>
<p>Basically, life is what you make of it.  At best, your parents can furnish you with a good education and a head start, but after you leave their nest, it&rsquo;s all up to you.  Not everyone who starts out ahead ends up ahead.  And not everyone who starts out behind ends up behind.  Neither is college necessary for a successful life (though it helps);   and neither does everyone belong in college at all. </p>

		<p>Dr. D - Thank you for your excellent and well-thought out comment.  My husband, as he truly became a Christian (as distinct from his infant baptism) also became a race realist.  We call ourselves not racists, but racialists.  We agree that as creatures of God, all deserve to be treated with a certain amount of respect and honor, but simple common sense, along with true scientific evidence, demand that we acknowledge inherent racial differences.  Exceptions notwithstanding (Sowell, Williams), blacks simply do not have the same level of intelligence across the spectrum - lowest to highest percentiles, not merely aggregate or average.</p>
<p>Question Diversity - I must differ with you.  Although certain studies have shown some advances for blacks via Head Start, numerous and better documented others have shown that it is only in certain instances and only temporary at best.  Many Head Start facilities are run by poorly-educated blacks who simply cannot provide any advancement for any child.  Even under the best of circumstances, they are attempting to replicate what the average white, middle-class child gets at home - discipline, structure, attention, affection, and exposure to an ever-increasing vocabulary.</p>
<p>Even in the exceptional case, when all these are provided at home, the majority of blacks still seethe with racial resentment.  An individual family I know - black/hispanic and Christian - discipline and educate their children.  They are well spoken and courteous - yet still they are familiar with hip-hop music and lyrics, the lowest of popular culture, and their parents still feel unfairly victimized by white society in general, rather than their own limitations.  I don&rsquo;t think this can be changed - it is the rare individual of any race who will freely admit to inferiority in anything without excuses or exceptions for his lack.</p>

		<p>The political assumption of equality before the law has morphed into equality without any qualifications. I think such an absolutist position is grounded, ironically, in the Fascist disposition. The sheer intolerance displayed by the racial absolutists leads me to this conclusion. <br>
Historically, I suppose John Brown is a likely antecedent role model. How such an antiquated and laborious-to-maintain political position has become so predominant defies common sense, but there you are. Sooner or later, I assume, the sheer impossibility of maintaining the delusion of equality will disable it. In the meantime we can all take satisfaction in knowing that the East Asian juggernaut, which will soon overtake and dominate the North American economies, laughs at our racial egalitarianism.</p>

		<p>My family raised me to be somewhat racially aware.  We were not ardent separatists, but there were boundaries we were raised not to cross, i.e. interracial dating.  IOW, people of other races should be treated like our brothers and sisters not made into our in-laws.  With rare exceptions, I got along with my black and latino coworkers and loosely associated with them.  However, I did not treat them all equally.  I was &#8220;prejudiced&#8221; against the twits and the jerks.  I was &#8220;biased&#8221; in favor of the honest, hardworking minorities who got it for themselves and did not blame &#8220;the man&#8221; for every problem they had.  Interestingly enough, I did not get flak from other blacks and minorities for &#8220;discriminating&#8221; against the twits and the jerks, they liked and respected me for it, because they had no use for them either.  </p>
<p>My political awakening came, late in life, when I went back to school.  I pretty much tuned droning teachers out throughout my public school career, though I managed to get good grades and so did not absorb much anti-white nonsense.  Late in life, I decided to go back to school and had to pay for my education, so I was paying attention.  I had to sit through lecture after lecture after lecture riddled with anti-white, anti-American bile often conducted by a white American.  Needless to say, I made it a point to challenge them and back them down. </p>
<p>Ironically, the most pro-white American professor I have had to date was a black African from Ghana who had a lot of things to say about western culture, particularly white American culture.  But what really opened my eyes was my Latino studies course where Reconquista was being propagandized, planned and implemented before my eyes.  </p>
<p>Blacks were obstacles to be swept aside in their desired goal to target and appropriate all white wealth and power as their own.  In one lecture I brought up MLK&rsquo;s I Have A Dream speech and they looked at me like I had lost my ever loving mind.  That&rsquo;s when my eyes were fully opened.  The only people who had bought MLK&rsquo;s I Have A Dream sell were the whites themselves.  None of the other races believe it.  Whites better wake up and accept it or we will end up being totally marginalized and dispossessed.  It&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>

		<p><i>I remember thinking that there are different subspecies (races) of birds, but they all fly well even if they have distinctive colors, and that it was therefore unlikely that different races of people would have a significant difference in the most essential characteristic of humans: intelligence.</i></p>
<p>I heard someone on TV say this once, when I was a kid. Even then I remember thinking it was stupid. How does a physical attribute, wings in this case, somehow correspond to intelligence? Furthermore, the initial premise of the comparison is flawed: all birds do <i>not</i> fly well. Ostriches, emus, penguins, and- as anyone who&rsquo;s seen the Thanksgiving episode of <i>WKRP in Cincinnati</i> can tell you- turkeys, are especially poor fliers.  </p>
<p><i>Race IS NOT a social construct. Society IS a racial construct.</i></p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a good one. I&rsquo;m jotting that one down in my book of proverbs and great sayings.</p>
<p><i>I wonder&hellip;do blacks REALLY think us whites sit around thinking about ways to oppress them?</i></p>
<p>I met a black college student once who seemed to believe exactly that. His mental powers were above average for his kind, but certainly not much past those of your average white tenth grader. He really hated my retort: &#8220;Why would white people waste our time trying to keep black people down? Black people do a great job of it all on your own. All we have to do is sit back and enjoy the show.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>I can see the truth about the races with my own eyes, and yet I know it&rsquo;s un-Christian to see my fellow human beings as inferior. A quandary indeed.</i></p>
<p>Honestly, I fail to see the quandary. To simply recognize the intellectual inferiority of the less intelligent is no more un-Christian than Christ&rsquo;s recognition of the moral inferiority of the Pharisees of His day (to use one example). </p>
<p>What would be un-Christian would be to deliberately harm them, or to treat them with any less respect in the basic human sense than you would anyone else. However, there is nothing immoral or wrong about judging a man, or a group, based on their actions and acting accordingly. </p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I so relate to this. I wonder what the role of Christianity is in race realism. I can see the truth about the races with my own eyes, and yet I know it&rsquo;s un-Christian to see my fellow human beings as inferior. A quandary indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;Excuse me for butting in, &#8220;but&#8221; this is one of my favorite themes that I have long felt requires addressing around the White survival movement - or whatever you wish to call it.  I often use that very fissure in the usual White Seperatist/conservative White movement to make the point that it is exactly Christianity that has led the West to destroy itself.  I often also point out that Christianity is a Helenized Middle-Eastern religious hybrid that invaded Europe and leeched in via the collapsed remnant of the Roman Empire and not any shortage of trickery, torture and persecution of normal indigenous Europeans - until litte was left but converted and adherents too terrified to venture - at least outwardly - toward any advance in this forced culture.  But the brilliance of the White European mind could not be surpressed and it burst into the world despite the manifold oppressions that the Church propetuated.  The long history of European civil wars are rooted in Christian arguments (Catholic/Protestant cheifly, but not entirely).  Those civil wars led to historical confrontations that culminated in the two world wars (a long explanation of that is required, but it can be qickley depicted as from the competition between Catholic and Orthodox Christianity).  But to leave off the long narrative, what I sincerely believe will be necessary for Whites to survive will also be a divorce from these fatally flawed philosophies that Christianity most fully represents.  I often write in response to those who claim that Christianity was the cause of Western Civilization that this is actually a false appraisal of historic reality.  In fact, Western Civilization formed DESPITE the estwhile Christian epic, which can only be truly said to be at best only a stimulant, rather than a direct cause or inspiration for Western White emergence and domination during the ancient and modern historic epic.  I also sincerely believe that the stage is being set for the complete collapse of the world of humanity - that is the entire human race - because the trend of Christian White culture has become to replace itself and otherwise adulterrate itself with non-White European racial types and cultures.  But is the mistaken idea of our Christian superority that provides the very dicotomy that allows the anti-White movement to continue regardless of how much any one person or group might claim to recognize the problem(s).</p>
<p>In regard to the idea that people need or require religion to have a community - I agree - even though I don&rsquo;t require one myself.  I recognize that most people do need spiritual parenting and that the community needs ritual in order to give it meaning and coherence.  In that vein, I can see the Celtic pre-Christian or the Nordic style shamanism as better choices than Chrisitanity because they are concerned with the actual land of the indigenous European as well as a purer relationship with the basic agricultural world that Whites are going to require to remaster in order to have a future.</p>
<p>As our house-of-cards national and world economic situation continues to lumber forward with promises of better times and miraculous fixes, a brighter future for all, etc., a basic understand of standard mathmatics ought to inform the intelligent that the human race cannot go on expanding - ultilizing fewer and fewer resources among more and more people.  Any person educated in science and knowledgeable in statistics will know that regardless of any imagined devine intervention, our human epic is timed out, due for a crash at any moment.  The best prognosticators are not sure whether the future will hold a complete annilhilation of the human animal or if it will go on having been greatly reduced in number.  But it is certain that this is a change that is coming.  The actually intelligent will seek to create a new and more likely to succeed cultural model - for truly, &#8220;Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m probably a little late here, but anyway, a few musings of my own..</p>
<p>I grew up in multicultural Australia, and always had several non-white friends growing up at school, it felt normal at the time. I think it wasn&rsquo;t really until well after university when I worked abroad, mostly in several Asian countries, that my way of thinking started to really change. It was the attitudes of the native people there that really shook me, and woke me up. They saw themselves as a distinct group of people vehemently defensive of their race and culture, and weren&rsquo;t about to change anything for anyone. I was at every point of my stay there very much the outsider, the foreigner, and though I was often treated with respect and decency, I was never let to forget for a minute that it was not my right to assume I was at home among people I could call my own. It was like experiencing natural human tendencies rather than any sort of ideology or social engineering that had been forced upon them. </p>
<p>From there it has been people I&rsquo;ve worked with (Blacks etc) who&rsquo;ve further opened my eyes, trips to Europe for work or to visit family, which are always eye-openers, and the continuing deterioration here in Australia. </p>
<p>I would say like other people who have commented, I was raised a Christian and still hold many of those values, so I often find it difficult to reconcile with the resentment I hold for some of these non-white groups. My friends (and to a lesser extent family - some agree with me 100%) also tell me I take it all far too seriously, nothing can be done, just accept it etc. But as much as I&rsquo;ve tried to suppress it it keeps coming back, and I&rsquo;ve accepted that I will stay interested and concerned in these matters. Finding this website and similar-minded people has been a great help, too.<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Fifth grade seems to be the turning point. Again, all these are measures of central tendency&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would argue that the leveling off is closer to third grade, rather than fifth. </p>
<p>It is in the third grade year that students are expected to go from &rsquo; learning to read&rsquo;  to &#8216;reading to learn&rsquo;  &mdash;  if  students do not master this basic skill and make the transition, they have virtually no chance of educational success and begin to quickly fall behind, never to catch up.   My experience with blacks is that most of them level off in reading around grade three to four and make no significant gains after that.  </p>
<p>Head Start is and has been a dismal failure and an enormous waste of money.</p>
<p>According to the Heritage Foundation:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;What existing research shows is a fade-out effect  &mdash;  whatever gains are made early on fade by the second grade&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Head Start is an expensive boondoggle but money will continue to pour ceaselessly  into this failed program as long as idiots such as gore falsely pontificate that:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Quality preschool can lead to higher IQs, higher reading and achievement levels, higher graduation rates and greater success in the workplace! says gore, echoing President Johnson&rsquo;s early optimism&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>And obama&rsquo;s phony stimulus package includes the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Core initiatives for low-income children such as Title I and Head Start will get significant boosts, a move that may help millions of future college students&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>To disagree with this is heresy.  Just ask Governor Carcieri of Rhode Island who was blasted by legislators, education advocates and the medical community for calling Head Start a &#8216;waste of money&rsquo; and a &#8216;dismal failure.&rsquo;  They claim the governor is ignoring strong evidence of the success of the federal program (without showing proof, of course, and the msm not demanding such).</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/qocmwa" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/qocmwa</a></p>
<p>The reason Head Start does not work is due to the low IQs of the targeted groups:</p>
<p>As Professor Rushton explains:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; real, underlying intelligence  &mdash;   g  &mdash;  cannot be improved by instruction&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Whiteplight:  &#8220;What a blazing generality with NO basis in fact!!! Tell Arnold Schwartzenegger that!!&#8221;<br>
==================<br>
Absolutely!   I have to agree with  Whiteplight here.  Where did we get this silly myth of the big, strong, muscle-bound black?   Yes, undeniably there are some blacks like that   &mdash;   a few.  But there are plenty of little, scrawny, wimpy blacks too.  I have never noticed that muscles are particularly confined to any given race  (well, I&rsquo;ll leave Asians out of that generalization);  but there are all physical types to be found among both whites and blacks.  The myth of black physical (and also sexual) prowess is just that:  a myth!   But too many whites are intimidated by it.</p>

<p>Actually whites on average actually do have more upper body strength. What white people need to do is learn to fight the way white people fight.</p>
<p>While blacks do have higher levels of testosterone and more fast twitch (quicker movements/punches) on average. A well trained white person can hold his own. Don&rsquo;t go blow for blow if he is quicker then you (they also have denser bones). Grapple with him and take the fight to the ground and use your (on average) superior strength to submit him, break an arm, whatever it takes. Use your on average superior intellect and foresight and take Russian Sambo, submission wrestling, jujitsu or another martial art that utilizes grappling. Try not to be intimidated (I know am am sometimes I am not a big strong person by any stretch of the measure). Remember if your white you ancestors are Viking, Romans, Knights, Highlanders, freaking crazy gaelic people who stripped naked, painted themselves blue and charged headlong at the Romans. William Wallace beat Shaka Zulu people!</p>
<p><br>
Now as for my awakening.</p>
<p>When I was very young I was home schooled. Had White friends who were also home schooled, went to an all white church, and had virtually no experience with black people.</p>
<p>When I hit the public school system in third grade, I could immediately tell a difference in the races between blacks and whites.</p>
<p>Blacks seemed faster and stronger (genetics/earlier maturation) but they also seemed more hostile, loud, made poor students the bulk of the time, and frankly would laugh loud as all get out at the smallest trifle that they considered to be funny.</p>
<p>Even being in third grade, I could tell a difference having gone from never associating with blacks to spending five days a week seven hours a day with them overnight. </p>
<p>Now&hellip;..to make a long story short, around the beginning of my senior year in high school I stumbled onto Philip Rushton and from there to Stormfront, where I really started to put my experiences into perspective. </p>
<p>I had perceived blacks as being fast and quick because they are</p>
<p>I had perceived blacks as having denser/stronger bones because they do</p>
<p>I had perceived blacks as many times being very loud and obnoxious because they are</p>
<p>I had perceived blacks as frankly less intelligent then myself and many whites in my school because they are </p>
<p>I had noticed that blacks generally equal the projects, but the projects don&rsquo;t make the black, the black makes the projects</p>
<p>I had always felt that blacks were many times overly aggressive, because they are</p>
<p>I had many times felt like blacks seemed to be amused at trivial matters&hellip;.it now seems I was correct in my perceptions. They have a different mindset and a  different pair of glasses to view the world from then myself and my kindred spirits.</p>

The reason whites back down is due to the police departments instructions to treat the blacks as a &#8220;protected class&#8221;. Those are poice officers words ; not mine. The other reason is this event they call &#8220;swarming&#8221;, they have no illusion of a one on one fight, they travel in packs and attack in packs.</p>

		<p>I became awakened in December 2002, my last year of college.  I was being brainwashed with multiculturalism and was noticing the double standards when it came to racial issues, plus I saw a 1964 argument that Strom Thurmond made against the Civil Rights.  His arguments were intelligent and made lots of sense. This was also the time Trent Lott was being ousted by the Republican Party for making Thurmond feel comfortable on his 100th birthday.  I saw the most nasty, hateful comments about whites and our culture, plus I came across Tim Wise (who irritated me immediately) and then listened to Jared Taylor.  Then I slowly (but not right off the bat) became more pro-European and more vocal about pointing the hypocrisy of so-called liberals over the years.  If I&rsquo;d not come across amren in 2002, I&rsquo;d have written off all pro-white people are &#8220;nazis&#8221; or &#8220;uneducated&#8221; or &#8220;hicks&#8221; and the usual labels.</p>

I think it&rsquo;s because whites are too afraid to be seen as &#8216;racists&rsquo; so they won&rsquo;t question any rude or bad behavior of a black person.  I&rsquo;ve also seen a good many white guys that are brawny and fit and black guys that are weaker-looking than me.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;I think it wasn&rsquo;t really until well after university when I worked abroad, mostly in several Asian countries, that my way of thinking started to really change. It was the attitudes of the native people there that really shook me, and woke me up. They saw themselves as a distinct group of people vehemently defensive of their race and culture, and weren&rsquo;t about to change anything for anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sums it up beautifully. When I was down in Mexico, the native peoples too are very much into their race(la raza) and culture and see themselves as distinct from the &#8220;gringo&#8221;(White person or any other race or nationality. While they may be nice and respectful, they won&rsquo;t ever consider you one of them.</p>

<p>Yes! White people are gifted in that we can derive generalized principles from disparate observations   &mdash;   this is called &#8220;common sense.&#8221;  This evolved ability has been a great asset in the survival and success of our people.  However, note that Leftists try to tell us that what we see with our own eyes is not true   &mdash;   it is &#8220;racists&#8221; to use common logic to understand your environment, to link cause-and-effect, and to predict future events based on past events, when considering Africans.  </p>
<p>However, in spite of what the government and the media tell me, I&rsquo;ve come to believe that if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, it probably is a duck. <br>

		<p>My awakening was a slow process.  I was raised in a rural area almost 100% White, in a Southern state.  Although I knew plenty of Blacks and Hispanics growing up due to my parents work relationships, in our area there were still the &#8220;invisible walls&#8221; of Segregation-era fallout that constrained interaction between the races.  In my youth I never experienced any of the horror stories that so many posters have related - in our area, such behavior by Blacks would have very likely resulted in vigilante-style violence.  This was true of course only for the small town folks; in our larger cities the same kind of ghetto mentality and violence was as plentiful as it is up North, we were just insulated from it.</p>
<p>My family on both sides descended from desperately poor sharecroppers.  Both parents literally grew up picking cotton, and although there was a definite thread of White pride in the family there was also a sort of shared empathy with Blacks out of the idea that &#8220;we know how they feel, because we worked like slaves and were treated like White trash.&#8221;  This empathy was reinforced by a steady diet of brotherhood programming at the local Baptist church and by the early multicultural onslaught of the late 60&rsquo;s / early 70&rsquo;s at school.</p>
<p>In college I learned quickly that my assumption &#8220;everybody is the same&#8221; was way, way off base.  I went to a large State university, which like all such institutions was tremendously liberal.  We were beaten over the head daily with diversity and multiculturalism, and like all eager and open-minded young college students I embraced it.  I learned to ignore the evidence in front of my own eyes, and attribute failure / problems to the evil racist influence of Whites like myself.  Just like at church, I learned to suppress the actual evidence in front of me and filter it through a belief system to get the &#8220;right&#8221; answer.  By the end of college, without consciously realizing it I had become indoctrinated into an orthodoxy more rigid than anything any church had ever practiced - the orthodoxy of Political Correctness.</p>
<p>Entry to the Great American Workforce caused the scales to begin dropping from my eyes.  Seeing Affirmative Action and EEO at work, and the miserable performance of some of its beneficiaries, made me start questioning my implicit assumptions that everybody was indeed the same.  I began to wonder exactly how those assumptions had come to be, when there was so much contrary evidence right in front of my eyes.  </p>
<p>As luck would have it, I happened to work in a field that supported military deception / psychological ops technologies.  As I began to question the assumptions that I had been saddled with, I soon realized that our own popular culture and media were quite literally programming us with the same sort of classic propaganda techniques that  were used against our enemies.</p>
<p>Quite simply, American Whites have been exploited and intentionally programmed to act against their own best interests in the name of multiculturalism.  Many of the tenets of PC are clearly antithetical to the interests of Whites, yet the vast majority of Whites eagerly embrace them out of a sense of guilt or an eagerness to comply with &#8220;good guy&#8221; behavioral standards that are touted at church, school, etc.  These propaganda techniques are most visible in the entertainment media, where for example the themes of interracial relationships and the &#8220;stupid White guy&#8221; are relentlessly pumped into the receptive brains of the viewers.  With enough repetition, such themes begin to be become accepted as reflections of reality, and thus the fantasy becomes reality itself.  Although less overt in some ways, such anti-White themes are pumped just as relentlessly through the news media, academia, religious institutions, and government channels.</p>
<p>Those who do not realize the extent of this programming effort will look at the above and wonder, &#8220;But why would anyone go this amount of effort?&#8221;  The answer is simple - because tearing down the existing White power structure benefits them in some way.  For a particular ethnic group, it benefits them by reducing the possibility of another Nazi-style regime.  For our leaders, it benefits them by producing a more fragmented and controllable population of serfs under the &#8220;divide and conquer&#8221; strategy.  For others, it might be a benefit as simple as advancing a particular political philosophy or goal.  </p>
<p>Is there some grand overarching conspiracy to tear down the White race?  Doubtful, IMHO.  However, there is manifestly a convergence of multiple interests that gain advantage by the systematic destruction of our culture and people.  Their reasons for engaging in their anti-White behavior may vary wildly, but the resultant effect of these many different efforts is as deadly to our immediate interests and long-term survival as if it were a deliberately coordinated campaign.</p>
<p>It is quite simple for all of you to see whether my conclusion has merit.  First, take a few moments to be objective in your viewing of entertainment media.  Take careful note of how many times you see the following themes in any given show:<br>
- The inept bugling White guy<br>
- The heroically competent Minority Guy<br>
- The evil, ruthless White villain (extra points if villain is neo-Nazi, Nazi, skinhead etc)<br>
- Interracial relationships (note carefully the much higher number of White female / Minority male pairings portrayed compared to White Male / minority female)<br>
- Rewritten history<br>
- Distorted history (i.e., contributions of key Whites downplayed and contributions of peripherally related Minorities magnified)</p>
<p>On the government side, all you have to do to understand the contempt your elite leaders have for you is to mute the sound on your TV and watch their body language and expressions while they speak to you.  You will immediately notice the exasperation, the contempt, the world-weary boredom they express when forced to explain their actions to the masses.</p>
<p>Once you detect the programming efforts, your eyes will be open.  When I reached that state, independent research led me to AR and other websites that confirmed my analysis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to wake up, people.  You are being led to racial slaughter, and most of you are going along willingly.  YOU DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO SUPPORT YOUR OWN DESTRUCTION.  It is not a crime or a sin to oppose the destruction of your people, your culture, and your nation.  Quit letting people convince you that doing so is wrong, and stand up for yourselves.  If you don&rsquo;t, your culture and your heritage will vanish from the pages of time.</p>

I absolutely agree! There are plenty of brawny whites and scrawny blacks. It works both ways. They come in all colors.  Blacks are not any bigger or stronger.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be correlated to race, one way or the other.</p>
<p>However, one big difference is that blacks are often given to crazy, erratic behavior, and you never know when one of them is going to go nuts over some tiny offense like an innocent bump that he takes as &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; him.  I&rsquo;ve been challenged for not saying &#8220;Excuse me.&#8221;   Well, you cant say &#8220;excuse me&#8221; to a million people in the subway, even though no discourtesy is intended.  But they are are always looking for some insult. On one occasion, one black started muttering that he was &#8220;going to shoot someone&#8221; (me) because it turned out I was standing in front  of some girl he had been looking at.  You never know what&rsquo;ll happen with them, and there are so many crazy ones around that it pays to just avoid them.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that they&rsquo;re crazier and wilder, but not bigger or stronger.</p>

<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>So do I.  What is un-Christian about recognizing simple reality?</p>
<p>We know that some people are beautiful and some are ugly.  Our own eyes tell us so. Are we to pretend that all people are equally beautiful?  (No one is suggesting we should persecute the ugly.)    Some people have athletic talent, or can play the piano, or have a beautiful singing voice.  Is it  &#8220;un-Christian to recognize&#8221; that fact?&hellip;  or must we pretend that all people are equally talented, despite what we see before our eyes?</p>
<p>Where does God require that we close our eyes to truth and reality?   After all, HE was the author of all our differences.  There is no reason to abuse or mistreat anyone, but there&rsquo;s no harm in recognizing  individual differences.   If He didn&rsquo;t want people to be different, He wouldn&rsquo;t make them that way.  He would have made us all exactly equal.   Obviously, He did not choose to have us be equal.  Thus the movement to make everyone  be exactly equal is both un-natural AND un-Christian.</p>
<p>I think  Anonymous is having some confusion about what is &#8220;un-Christian&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>My Christian beliefs are not at all compromised by my recognition of differences in races.  Certainly I believe blacks can become Christians and receive salvation in a future heaven where there will be no races.  The Eastern Orthodox Church to which I belong recognizes the desirability of having ethnically separate patriarchates.  The Ethiopians have a patriarchate as well as do the Greeks and Russians and Ukrainians, etc.  They should all stay in their own churches and their own countries.  God will unite us all in heaven, the Metropolitans and Bishops can conference together as men of God, regardless of race.</p>
<p>Now, I do admit that blacks DO make a good case for evolution, though.  I&rsquo;m still working through that one.</p>

		<p>As far as I can tell, whites have blacks beat on strength.  Strength is distinct from power, however, which is a function of strength and speed.  Blacks also have whites beat on being generally designed for boxing (more aggressive, less intelligent, denser bone structure, longer reach, etc.).  Blacks are not taller (the mean differences between the two are insignificant, something like 1 or 2 tenths of an inch if memory serves).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the big deal vis-a-vis physical differences and self-defense.  Humans started using tools for self-defense millions of years ago, and a gun or a knife trumps a fist every time.</p>

		<p>Something I left out of my &#8220;racialist origin&#8221; is that I was also raised with a kernel of racial pride.  It didn&rsquo;t take much in my case, just a casual word here or there from my father.  I don&rsquo;t know if this is something specific to my character, or something that will flourish in any white man not &#8220;properly trained,&#8221; but for as long as I remember I&rsquo;ve been a sort of poster child for GST; watching films and television, or reading books, I rooted for villains (common) and heroes (rare) alike because they looked a lot like me, and against heroes who looked too little like me.  I resented the hell out of the fact that my phenotype (Nordish) was being systematically pathologized.  At an early age I developed my own little &#8220;culture of critique&#8221; for dealing with these situations, where watching mass entertainment media amounted to an opportunity for me to lampoon the media masters.</p>
<p>Contrary to leftist/libertarian boilerplate, however, I have never been prone to groupthink; I&rsquo;m far out on the right hand tail of the individualism bell curve, which I think is the norm amongst racialists.</p>
<p>I think amateur &#8220;culture of critique&#8221; is an amazingly effective way of waking people up.  Once you point out the &#8220;rules&#8221;, even a fool can see what&rsquo;s going on.  From that point, reality can only be driven further and further home as the media sticks to the &#8220;rules&#8221; and leaves less and less room in the enlightened observer&rsquo;s mind about whether the pattern is intended.  From there it&rsquo;s a short walk to wondering about the &#8220;whys&#8221;.</p>
<p>These things will tend to matter most to Nordish people, obviously, as they&rsquo;re the ones getting hammered.  But it can be highly effective on both sexes, as mothers tend not to like the idea of their children growing up under such a regime.</p>

		<p>Since people are sharing their stories about what (or the series of whats) that made them &ldquo;see the light,&rdquo; with regard to race, I thought I would do the same. Interestingly, I grew up in a household and a neighborhood that might be seen as &ldquo;retrograde&rdquo; for its time, when it comes to the issues surrounding blacks initially, and later on Arabs of the Muslim persuasion as well, who had begun their major invasions of our area and the nearest suburbs in the 1970s through 1990s.  </p>
<p>I was born in 1972 and was one of (along with my twin sister) the youngest of five children; my father was a Detroit policeman, and my mother a homemaker. Our home was located on the far Westside of the city, in a neighborhood off the Southfield freeway and Ford Road, that was colloquially called &ldquo;Warrendale.&rdquo; The community derives its name largely from the fact that Warren Avenue was (is?) its main local business thoroughfare. It was an overwhelmingly white enclave, with Polish Catholics making up its main ethnic/religious group and city workers its primary economic class. </p>
<p>In short, it may not have been the &ldquo;Garden of Eden,&rdquo; but it was a safe and stable community on the outskirts of a dusky disaster area determined to become an outright black hole, under the &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; of one Comrade Coleman Alexander Young and his merry band of Mau Maus. </p>
<p>My father had worked during the 67 Riots, as had many of his fellow officers of his generation, and they were all quite well aware of both the causes and symptoms of the black &ldquo;phoenix&rdquo; that arose out of that Red inspired looting and shooting jamboree. From the 70s through the 90s, things became progressively worse in the city until my father and many of his collogues finally became so disgusted that they mostly just retired and moved to the suburbs themselves in the 90s. </p>
<p>Thus, by the time I went off to college, I had a pretty solid race-realist foundation and consciousness. What miniscule racially &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; or liberal inclinations I might have held were rather well rooted out in the Catholic high school (about 25% to 30% black) that my parents could afford to send my sister and myself to. The public &ldquo;high school&rdquo; we could have attended, Cody High, was not an option as it was about 85% to 95% black and was an utter hellhole. Even the blacks (mostly not Catholic mind you and given tuition breaks) that went to our school were there because their parents didn&rsquo;t want them at that scholastic Zimbabwe in microcosm. </p>
<p>The main contribution to the school by this minority of blacks that we did have there, was trouble and chaos. There were in fact two serious racial incidents, where rumors circulated following them that there would be a &ldquo;race riot,&rdquo; which had my parents call both of us in sick for a few days. Moreover, it was at that Catholic high school, where I &ldquo;learned&rdquo; that Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi were &ldquo;saints;&rdquo; and watched both religious and secular faculty fawn over these abysmally inept and disorderly black students in so disgusting a manner, that it bordered on idolatry. </p>
<p>Also, in one prerequisite &ldquo;religion&rdquo; course that we had to take, we were subjected to an odd version of early &ldquo;sensitivity training&rdquo; where you picked slips of paper out of a bowl  and were assigned to &ldquo;live&rdquo; in a country: the USA, the USSR, or India. The room was divided into sections and if you were: the USA, you got Pepsi, Big Macs, and other goodies; if you were in the USSR, you got kielbasa, black bread, and tonic water (I guess their substitute for vodka,) and if from India plain rice and water. Laughably, the USA and USSR (which I was assigned to) had a &ldquo;nuclear war&rdquo; with paper wads and airplanes much to the chagrin of our &ldquo;teacher,&rdquo; who once she reestablished  &ldquo;détente,&rdquo; informed us quite sanctimoniously that the point of the exercise was to show that affluence and comfort were just a matter of &ldquo;luck and birth,&rdquo; and that we should strive to share our &ldquo;good fortune&rdquo; with the more unfortunate of the earth in places like India through donations and aid&hellip;blah, blah, blah. </p>
<p>To say the least, any questions about how India, or for that matter the Soviet bloc, were in their &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; states economically and materially were waved off as &ldquo;bigoted&rdquo; and &ldquo;silly&rdquo; by our &ldquo;educator.&rdquo; Of course, the more inquisitive of us by nature drew other less orthodox conclusions and chatted amongst ourselves outside of class about such &ldquo;inequalities&rdquo; and their causes. Interestingly, no blacks were ever part of these little discussions and critiques of our tolerance torture session. </p>
<p>Go figure?</p>
<p>My experiences in college and graduate school never swayed me in my thinking on such issues, nor has my experiences in the workforce or following politics. It only became more clear, overtime, that what my community and parents had accepted as commonsense and sanity, was just that. If there ever comes a day where Marxism or multiculturalism &ldquo;enriches&rdquo; me, it will be a strange first in other words!</p>
<p>All the best and God help us all,</p>

<p>Just wondering, did you grow on the Eastside or the Westside? I lived in both Wayne (see the above post) and Macomb counties, the Macomb years were a later timeframe for me; the vast majority of my life in the Detroit area was spent on the Westside.

		<p>I find it interesting how many people have become race realists through the experience of teaching in our public schools.  I&rsquo;ve said it before, but it bears repeating   &mdash;   Teach For America is Jared Taylor&rsquo;s best covert program for creating race realists.  Start with a nice crop of fresh faced starry eyed white liberals.  Give them some indoctrination about how the backward state of black children is due to the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, and institutional racism   &mdash;   all Whitey&rsquo;s fault.  Then the schock therapy comes   &mdash;   a couple of years of actual experience in an American inner city school.  If they survive in one piece, they come flocking to Amren for sure.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, the leftists think that Teach For America is one of their ideas, and a good vehicle for spreading the liberal program.</p>

		<p>There are a number of reasons why i have become more race conscious. But perhaps the biggest reason is witnessing, in the last twenty years or so, how the hispanics have litteraly taken over the small city (where i was born and raised,) here in New York. Since the 1960&#8221;s, my family, our relatives (my uncle, on my jewish side, was the city judge back in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s,) and other whites (the homesteaders,) have been forced to intergrate with blacks (Through the school system for one.) One of the results of this forced intergration between blacks and whites, is that the hispanics have &#8220;backdoored&#8221; there way into the community in recent years, starting businesses and creating families. The strong sense of family is of course-the backbone of every community.</p>
<p>Because of this &#8220;maintained core&#8221; family value, the hispanic (whom a large number can&rsquo;t even speak proper english,) have been able to thrive and produce here. </p>
<p>When do we whites reaestablish our family core vaules?</p>

<p>This is absolutely correct.  A good example is Southern California.  European-Americans took a barren desert and in only 100 years converted it into one of the greatest areas in the world   &mdash;   high standard of living, great universities, fantistic culture.  Then they gave it all away to Mexicans and Asians.  UC Irving, which was 90% white 50 years ago, is today only 20% European-American.  We surrendered the most prised real estate on the planet without a shot being fired. We even paid for our own displacement via government subsidies and affirmative action for the invaders.  Absolutely, unbeliveably stupid!   </p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t found quite the right formula yet, but for all of us who post regularly on MSM sites, the response to every single thing we say is of course the charge of &#8220;racism,&#8221; which is supposed to trump whatever we have said, end the discussion, and expose us as moral vipers and confirm our accusers as guardians of social and personal virtue.</p>
<p>Any response back to them that implicitly accepts &#8220;racism&#8221; as a bad thing (such as pointing out that it&rsquo;s other races that are truly &#8220;racist&#8221;) seems to me like a boomerang in the long run, because the consciousness and actions we are urging on whites are considered by them to also be &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find a way to turn the tables on this malignant word &#8220;racism&#8221; that encumbers our efforts at every turn.</p>
<p>My latest idea: The next time a poster on my MSM site (knoxnews.com  &mdash;  I post openly and provocatively as a white nationalist, and the regulars know me and are mostly tolerant) accuses me of &#8220;racism,&#8221; this will be my response:</p>
<p>&#8220;The set of attitudes and behaviors referred to by the word &#8216;racism&rsquo; have biologically evolved to protect races  &mdash;  only whites during the last 60 years have hypnotized themselves to believe that they don&rsquo;t have such feelings.</p>
<p>The fact that persons with your views have coined a pejorative to disparage these natural defenses is something you should take up with your grandchildren, who will be the saddest victims of the society your illusions are creating.&#8221;</p>
<p>I post there almost every day, so I try to find pointed things to say over and over and over, since I think repetition is what has an effect on the average mind, not reason.</p>
<p>If it turns out that the above just puts off readers there, well, maybe it will at least have the effect of putting in a better light the more moderate posters there whose posts are implicitly white nationalist!</p>

		<p>I found John PM&rsquo;s comments about the &#8220;sensitivity course&#8221; quite interesting, because we were forced in college to do a very similar exercise in an honors English course.  Our prof was a dyed-in-the-wool hippie and absolutely oozing with peace, love, and understanding for everything EXCEPT America and its people, culture, and traditions.  Just like John&rsquo;s teacher, her sensitivity exercise was chosen to demonstrate to us that being born in the USA was nothing but LUCK and that we should feel shame for our wealth and abundance of choices.</p>
<p>The thing these sort of folks just flat don&rsquo;t get, is that there is absolutely ZERO percent chance that any of us could have been born anywhere else on the planet.  Our soul didn&rsquo;t just magically flit into the womb of a waiting woman - we were created out of the genetic whole cloth of our PARENTS.  The fact that we enjoy wealth and freedom of choice in the USA is not an accidental benefit of birth, it is entirely the deliberate result of our own people working hard to develop a society and nation that gave us these things.  We were born here by design, and each of us is a thread in the vast tapestry that our race has woven over hundreds of thousands of years of combined effort.</p>
<p>These teachers try to instill a sense of guilt and shame for us benefiting from the success of our culture, while completely absolving the 3rd worlders of any responsibility for their own predicament.  &#8220;If they were as lucky as you, they&rsquo;d have Big Macs too!&#8221;  Sorry teach, that&rsquo;s a complete line of baloney.  The reason they don&rsquo;t have Big Macs and clean water is because their CULTURE has been an abysmal failure.  Their ancestors and parents purposely chose to reproduce amidst an environment of failure, and we Whites do not bear an iota of responsibility for that choice.  We have no reason to feel guilt or shame because of our ancestors&rsquo; success, and it&rsquo;s high time that our teachers at school and church quit trying to make us do so.<br>

<p><br>
Although I&rsquo;m an Agnostic and a Darwinian Evolutionist, I&rsquo;m sympathetic to the Christians on this thread trying to reconcile the Bible&rsquo;s message of brotherhood with the reality of just how difficult (if not impossible) such brotherhood is, given the undeniable differences between the races. I&rsquo;d certainly never try to tell anybody how or if they should worship   &mdash;   but I do agree with the above poster that &#8220;blacks DO make a good case for evolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the two seemingly contradictory ideas   &mdash;   Christianity and Race Realism   &mdash;   might be satisfactorily reconciled: </p>
<p>Even most Creationists would admit that people(s) can change over time. What were once habits become, over the course of centuries, ingrained, internalized, and even biologically-programmed behaviors, traits, etc, throughout an entire racial group. For instance, the white concern with time and lateness   &mdash;   and the lack of concern for these things among blacks. One group has been wearing watches for hundreds of years; the other group hasn&rsquo;t (and often STILL doesn&rsquo;t). No need for me to identify which is which. </p>
<p>Noticing things like this does NOT require a full-blown belief in Evolution   &mdash;   nor does it contradict anything in the Bible. </p>
<p>Myself, I don&rsquo;t regard Africans&rsquo; lower place on the evolutionary ladder as a moral failing on their part, and it doesn&rsquo;t make me hate them. But I do consider it reason to avoid their company. All I have EVER wanted from blacks is not to have to be around them. </p>
<p>And also, please keep in mind that Darwin himself never denied the possibility of God or other supreme force having &#8220;got the ball rolling&#8221; in the first place. Darwinism does NOT equal Atheism. </p>
<p>In other words, I may never set foot inside a church again   &mdash;   but I&rsquo;m much more friendly towards race-realist religious folks than multiculti non-believers. Ethnically conscious whites, both devout like you and lapsed like me can work together. I&rsquo;m very willing to respect your faith as long as you respect my race. </p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re reading AR, I already know you respect my race. </p>
<p>PS. Excellent comments everybody! Always nice to see an AR comments section pass the 100 mark! </p>

<p>A very interesting post, we were practically neighbors when we were kids. Southfield was only about fifteen to twenty minutes from where we lived when I was growing up.

Sometimes, after I moved to Clinton Township, when I would drive to the Livonia/Westland area to visit family or friends and wanted a change of pace from the 696/275 madness, I would take 8 Mile down to Telegraph and then Warren Avenue to get there. That was the Macomb/Oakland side of the road, so I felt relatively safe; if I didn&rsquo;t feel like taking the freeway on the way back, I would always take the Quarton/Big Beaver/Metro Parkway stretch from Telegraph to get home. </p>
<p>Interestingly, I am taking a trip back to the area today and staying the week. </p>
<p>Have a great week Alexandra, </p>
<p>John PM!</p>

<p>&#8220;When do we whites reaestablish our family core values?&#8221;</p>
<p>Possibly when times finally get so rough that families have to cling together in order to survive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a little time in Mexico, and I believe that is one secret of Hispanics&rsquo; strong feeling of family that you mention. South of the border is not a world of gov&rsquo;t safety nets, and in Mexico I&rsquo;ve seen extended families have to depend on each other in order to survive.</p>

		<p>Visine, I hope you return to this thread and read this because I&rsquo;m eager to pick your brain.  Please drop me an email?</p>
<p><i>Many of the tenets of PC are clearly antithetical to the interests of Whites, yet the vast majority of Whites eagerly embrace them out of a sense of guilt or an eagerness to comply with &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; behavioral standards that are touted at church, school, etc.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy the &#8220;guilt&#8221; thing any more.  I think the dirty secret of white compliance of their own destruction is that <i>it&rsquo;s now a tribal/ethnic/racial norm</i>.  First rule of fight club is, you don&rsquo;t talk about fight club.  Among the first rules of being white is that the rules must only ever be implicitly white and tribal (since whites are not allowed to act, or think, about being white in a positive sense).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to suspect this is a big part of why the rules are so pernicious; in order to be a white tribal/ethnic/racial member in good standing, whites have to sign onto the suicide pact (not that it&rsquo;s ever called by its proper name, obviously).</p>
<p><i>These propaganda techniques are most visible in the entertainment media, where for example the themes of interracial relationships and the &ldquo;stupid White guy&rdquo; are relentlessly pumped into the receptive brains of the viewers.</i></p>
<p>Are you familiar with research on the brain&rsquo;s ability to distinguish television and film from reality?  Obviously our conscious modules (or whatever) are able to make the distinction, but I seem to recall reading somewhere that generally the brain as a whole is not.  I&rsquo;d love to know more about this sort of thing.</p>
<p><i>With enough repetition, such themes begin to be become accepted as reflections of reality, and thus the fantasy becomes reality itself. Although less overt in some ways, such anti-White themes are pumped just as relentlessly through the news media, academia, religious institutions, and government channels.</i></p>
<p>Have you noticed that the smaller the venue, the less true this becomes?  I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of sci-fi and fantasy shows made for cable that seem quite divergent from some of the rules that the bigger players follow much more strictly.</p>
<p><i>It is quite simple for all of you to see whether my conclusion has merit. First, take a few moments to be objective in your viewing of entertainment media. Take careful note of how many times you see the following themes in any given show:<br>
- The inept bugling White guy<br>
- The heroically competent Minority Guy<br>
- The evil, ruthless White villain (extra points if villain is neo-Nazi, Nazi, skinhead etc)<br>
- Interracial relationships (note carefully the much higher number of White female / Minority male pairings portrayed compared to White Male / minority female)<br>
- Rewritten history<br>
- Distorted history (i.e., contributions of key Whites downplayed and contributions of peripherally related Minorities magnified)</i><br>
To this excellent list I would add:<br>
- Blurring true human biodiversity via casting decisions (Keanu Reeves is the poster child for this, but I&rsquo;m also referring to the phenomenon of the Disappearing Blond Male, the replacement of the feminine woman with the masculine woman, the new monopoly given to blacks on the role of tall, strong male, etc.)<br>

		<p><i>&ldquo;The set of attitudes and behaviors referred to by the word &lsquo;racism&rsquo; have biologically evolved to protect races &mdash; only whites during the last 60 years have hypnotized themselves to believe that they don&rsquo;t have such feelings.</i></p>
<p>The fact that persons with your views have coined a pejorative to disparage these natural defenses is something you should take up with your grandchildren, who will be the saddest victims of the society your illusions are creating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you want to get <b>really</b> subversive, you might want to turn white &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; back upon itself by mentioning the fact that anti-racism is a white tribal belief.  That is, whites expect it only in other whites, and heap opprobrium only on whites for rejecting &#8220;anti-racism,&#8221; so white &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; is in fact part of a racial caste system.  White &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; is the (incomprehensibly pathetic) white equivalent of blacks&rsquo; &#8220;is he black enough&#8221;?</p>
<p>You might also want to really hammer home the grandkids thing: e.g., a nice rhetorical flourish like, &#8220;Your grandchildren won&rsquo;t understand why you did this to them, and they&rsquo;ll hate you for it.&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>or a particular ethnic group, it benefits them by reducing the possibility of another ****-style regime.</i></p>
<p>I have a problem with this explanation: the parallels between the behavior of the group in question today, and that of the same group in the past leading up to the regime in question.  These parallels seem very strong to this casual observer (casual observer of the latter, not the former), and the latter predates the regime, and so too the excuse for the behavior.</p>
<p>I think the regime in question is the fig leaf, the excuse.  I think the real explanation might be supremism, or maybe a combination of supremism and the jealousy alluded to by Cuddihy in <i>The Ordeal of Civility</i> (and recently expounded upon by a racialist author whose name escapes me at the moment).</p>

This is how it was EVERYWHERE before the creation of the welfare state (a very modern thing). For eons, families were the equivalent of Social Security.  The welfare state has, in effect, replaced the family.  </p>
<p>This phenomenon is especially vivid when you look at the huge number of blacks being conceived and raised outside of traditional families. For them, Uncle Sam has become the new &#8220;Massah&#8221;.<br>

<p>&#8220;As Professor Rushton explains:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; real, underlying intelligence  &mdash;  g  &mdash;  cannot be improved by instruction&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we here already know this, and I strongly suspect the government does too.</p>
<p>Bon&#8221;</p>
<p>I think Dr. Rushton is certainly correct on this point. I remember back when I was getting my undergraduate degree, and there were tons of these dull-witted &#8216;white&rsquo; students who spent the vast majority of their time doing everything BESIDES studying their course materials. They had very poor verbal skills, and could barely express themselves beyond the level of what used to be considered pre-secondary levels. Not only that, their behavior was positively awful   &mdash;   lazy, dirty, ill-dressed, promiscuous, etc.  </p>
<p>I remember thinking, can these types realistically be expected to perform at the normal &#8216;college level&rsquo; as this has been understood in our history? Can their intellectual level be artificially &#8216;propped up&rsquo; through external instruction? Certainly NOT! Clearly, they would never have been able to compete successfully back in the days when college was considered a rare privilege, not a universal right. They would have been much better off operating a cash register, or perhaps learning a technical skill, rather than wasting the time of the other students who actually benefitted from the higher education.</p>

<p>Reminds me of the NAMs, especially blacks, that I see every year in the school district receiving  full scholarships to colleges and universities while more qualified Whites and Asians with higher test scores and academic achievement are locked out  &mdash;  or must pay their own way in full.</p>
<p>College/University admissions are a zero sum game  &mdash;  for every unqualified NAM admitted, a qualified Asian or White is locked out.</p>
<p>Do you believe this is fair?  </p>
<p>I often wonder how  blacks with SAT verbal scores in the 3-400s, math scores even lower, and abysmal writing scores fare at universities.  </p>
<p>What happens when these blacks, who are heaped with honors and scholarship monies, and are told repeatedly that they can be doctors, lawyers, engineers  &mdash;  are put into pre-med or engineering  courses with Asians, Jews and Whites that received 5s on advanced placement Chemistry, Physics and Calculus classes and math SAT scores in the 700s? </p>
<p>Answer:  They become black or chicano studies majors or drop out.</p>
<p>I would posit that they&rsquo;d be much better off behind a cash register  &mdash;  as long as the cash register has pictures on it as does McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Of course Rushton is correct.  He is also correct that blacks have a group IQ score average of 85, hispanics around 90. </p>

<p>(A correspondence with a staff member where I post ended when I commented with self-deprecating irony on the inconsistency of my posting efforts there that I &#8220;wasn&rsquo;t much of a racial warrior&#8221;  &mdash;  -the use of the term &#8220;warrior&#8221; evidently frightened the staff member.)</p>

		<p>All excellent posts, and a well done, legitimate subject. I&rsquo;m an observer, keenly interested in human behavior. I&rsquo;ve always been a believer in the fact that if you look at someone&rsquo;s background, 99% of the time you can see why they turned out like they did. In fact, if I were  younger, I would be dedicating myself to becoming a forensic psychologist to investigate the background of criminals and what made them act the way they did (until recently I never even knew there was such a thing and it even had a name.)</p>
<p>Several things that I&rsquo;ve noticed in trying to dissect white versus black behavior: While just driving down the streets through my town, I&rsquo;ve always noticed the large numbers of groups of blacks just standing around, doing nothing. It occurred to me that never have I seen a group of young whites just hanging around the outside of a store or standing around a car. It&rsquo;s always been clear that if a group of whites - more than two - were gathering together, it was for a specific event or purpose. So the obvious is that a large number of blacks, for whatever reason, have nothing to do or don&rsquo;t want to do anything productive.</p>
<p>But the most disturbing thing I&rsquo;ve been actively aware of for the past few years is the obscene numbers of white girls with half black babies. In ONE DAY day in a store I saw: A young white girl waiting at the service desk with a half black baby, who  was crawling all over the filthy WalMart floor, around and in between the legs of people in line while the fat black grandmother was sitting spread-legged on a bench talking on a cell phone, and the two black sisters-in-law or whatever were cackling and slapping each other, hollering, &#8220;Girl, whatchoo talkin&rsquo; bout!!&#8221; None even had a clue where the baby was. A few minutes earlier I had seen a young blonde girl with a tattooed, dreadlocked, rapper type holding up his britches with the crotch hanging to his knees, along two half black toddlers. And while in the checkout line a family came in behind me that consisted of a young blond, ponytailed boy of about 18 with his black girlfriend/wife/ whatever, and a half black toddler in the cart. The toddler was hollering, and both parents would scream, &#8220;Shaddup!!!&#8221;  &#8220;Shaddup or I&rsquo;ll woop  your a**!&#8221;  While noticing all this disturbing interracial behavior, what ELSE I notice bothers me even more: Hardly anyone looks twice anymore.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope I&rsquo;m wrong, but I believe we&rsquo;ve come too far to go back. We are becoming a third world nation with a gag firmly tied over our mouths.</p>

<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t unfair   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s simply reality. I also assume any black I encounter is dangerous until he/she proves otherwise. No different from rattlesnakes, alligators, scorpions or black widow spiders. I don&rsquo;t hate any of them either, but I do acknowledge their inherent danger as a matter of common sense.</p>
<p>My racial epiphany was slow in coming. There were no blacks at all in my K-8 schools, and I can count on one hand the ones in high school. So all I knew about them growing up was the lies the MSM spewed at me. Nor did I run across many blacks during my eight years in the USAF, and all but a few were intelligent, hard-working and decent. (One even claimed to be massively attracted to me, but since I was already married she could only look and I could only wonder if she really meant it.)</p>
<p>My first hint that there was something wrong with blacks in general came in a youth football league that I officiated. One of the teams was nearly all black with a 100% black coaching staff, and they were the dirtiest team in the league by a wide margin. We were constantly flagging them for holding, spearing, late hits, yanking face masks, etc., so it was obvious the players had been coached to ignore the rules. The truly memorable incident came near the end of a game when one of these players speared an opponent at midfield. Within a minute the ball was at the 5-yard line courtesy of multiple unsportsmanlike-conduct penalties against the coaches. Then one coach sneered, &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t you just give them a touchdown?&#8221; So I instantly did just that (apparently that coach never read the rulebook) and told them I would forfeit the game to the opponents if anyone said another word. Since they were still ahead by two touchdowns, that shut them up. What were their black fans doing during all this? Cheering the nutcase coaches on, of course.</p>
<p>The real tragedy was that the black team in question was the most talented in the league and could easily have won all their games playing clean. But the coaches and fans wanted an insurance policy   &mdash;   constant penalties against them so they could blame the &#8220;racist honky refs&#8221; if they ever lost.</p>
<p>Now all of this should have awakened me, but since I was still in the USAF and never encountered such buffoonery on base I wrote it off as an aberration. Only after leaving the USAF six years later and moving to the Ft. Worth-Dallas area did I realize that those thugs posing as football players, coaches and fans were typical blacks, and what I&rsquo;d witnessed at that game was not an aberration but was in fact typical black behavior.</p>

<p>A non-issue; if the types of extremists you mention didn&rsquo;t exist, our enemies would invent them.  They <i>have</i> invented some of them, of course (What we don&rsquo;t know is how big a tip of the iceberg is represented by the ones we <i>do</i> know about).  So these examples will exist, and our enemies will use them, regardless of anything we do.  All we can do is create cognitive dissonance by not living up to stereotype (and pointing out this fact).</p>
<p>Given all this, in this context the worse thing that could happen would be for the media-trumpeted &#8220;extremism&#8221; to consist of the mildest divergence from establishment-approved, suicide-friendly &#8220;norms&#8221; (because at that point you&rsquo;d know your people to be well and truly cattle; otherwise the media wouldn&rsquo;t reach so far).</p>

<p>But a further, and important, point to be made is that all of this  snobbish, anti-racist virtue is never at a cost to THEM.   It is virtue that is paid for by OTHERS   &mdash;   people further down the economic scale whose interests can be sacrificed with impunity, without cost to the virtuous  ones on high.  How handy!</p>

<p>Do you believe this is fair?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, not at all, but from my own experience it was mostly people who would have been classified as &#8216;white&rsquo; who did the slacking off and the trouble-making. Oh sure, the blacks were probably worse, but there weren&rsquo;t very many on campus. My point was that the issue shouldn&rsquo;t just be about &#8216;races&rsquo; at the macro-level, it should be about encouraging the best individuals within races. Since the mid-19th century there has been a huge outgrowth in the most marginal elements of the &#8216;white&rsquo; community, thanks to improved nutrition and medical science. This has to be reversed, otherwise the behavioral norms of the &#8216;blacks&rsquo; and &#8216;whites&rsquo; are going to continue to diminish further and further.<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;it should be about encouraging the best individuals within races&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You well know that this is not done.</p>
<p>Colleges, universities and employers practice a racial head count  &mdash;  and this is openly, not covertly done, with the full encouragement of the government.  If they don&rsquo;t, they open themselves to attack by the justice department for practicing racism.  AA is a monstrous drag on the economy precisely because employers must hire a certain number of low/non performing NAMs.</p>
<p>If NAMs were able to compete on a level playing field, AA, quotas, set asides and other specious types of racial discrimination against Whites would not be necessary.  That old cry of &#8216;racism!&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t work any longer as the government, for the past 40 years, has fire-hosed trillions of dollars into the schools with the explicit purpose of closing the achievement gap between NAMs and Whites/ Asians.  The achievement gap, despite a profound dumbing down of the tests (NAEP,  SAT, ACT, CST, AP) has not budged and in fact has widened.  I know this because I have been giving, and have graded these tests for over 20 years.</p>
<p>The fact is, they are not able to compete  &mdash;  but the prevailing false dogma is that &#8216;all the races have equal intelligence!&rsquo; (without one shred of evidence to prove this and plenty of hard scientific evidence proving the exact opposite).</p>
<p>To question this dogma is to put one&rsquo;s career, pension and reputation in grave danger.  Why is it that Professors Ruston, Lynn and Murray are vilified, smeared, attacked physically and personally?  Why are they physically prevented from lecturing?</p>
<p>If their research showing that NAMs have lower intelligence and smaller brains is false, then let&rsquo;s have the proof, open up the debate  &mdash;  obviously, since there is no data disproving their research, they must be personally destroyed by the msm and academia. </p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;huge outgrowth in the most marginal elements of the &lsquo;white&rsquo; community, thanks to improved nutrition and medical science&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It is because of WHITE medicine and WHITE technology and WHITE research that life spans on the entire planet have increased  &mdash;  including a population explosion in Africa because of stupid White altruism.</p>
<p>The most marginal elements of the black community,  thanks to WHITE improvements in nutrition, sewage and water treatments have been allowed to increase, to the detriment of White society.</p>
<p>Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, that you are perfectly content to live in a technologically advanced civilization created  by WHITES  &mdash;  a civilization that blacks are not capable of creating or maintaining (see photos of SA lately?).</p>
<p>You complain about us in White-created comfort using WHITE technology  &mdash;  air conditioning, advanced computer technology, modern medicine.   Next time you need medical care stop yourself!  You wouldn&rsquo;t want to make use of White-created first-world medicine would you?  Find yourself a witch doctor instead.</p>
<p>How about giving up ALL those things created by WHITES?<br>
You&rsquo;d be living in a hollow log eating bugs within a week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say you have a lot to be thankful for due to those evil, racist WHITES.  We should have kept our creations and innovations to ourselves, for our people and not stupidly shared them with those who are ungrateful, those who attack and vilify us.</p>

		<p>Visine&rsquo;s comments in post #96 pretty well encapsulates the nature of the problems we are enmeshed in, and how she handled them. She also implies how to sensibly deal with them as individuals and families. The Anglo world is the least capable of dealing with its self-created racial problems, mainly because it has come to believe its own propaganda. That is, its ludicrous political, social, religious and racial fantasies and delusions. These are the memes that are crippling our collective mindset, and they have been ruthlessly exploited as well by our ethnic enemies, within and without.(See my above post #48).</p>
<p>Everyone else in the world reacts immediately to racial and ethnic attacks upon their genetic collective, except the psychologically paralyzed whites! Instead of reacting with canes and pitchforks to constant racial assaults, we Anglos usually wimp around, genuflecting to our tormentors. We are in real national and racial trouble, and the hour is very late, so spread the word to the white &#8216;brain dead&rsquo;, now! It&rsquo;s time to start getting pushy and talking about our dilemma to anyone who will listen, almost everywhere, and all of the time. Plant the seeds of doubt, and watch them eventually grow. The inter-racial madhouse is starting to crumble, so help grease the skids!</p>

		<p>&#8220;I remember back when I was getting my undergraduate degree, and there were tons of these dull-witted &lsquo;white&rsquo; students who spent the vast majority of their time doing everything BESIDES studying their course materials.&#8221;</p>
<p>You know, funny you mention it, for I also remember in college a lot of marginally &#8216;white&rsquo; &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; who fit this description perfectly! </p>
<p>I also remember reading somewhere that one of the biggest pastimes on Mexican college campuses is reading comic books  &mdash;  so again, another example of marginal &#8216;whites&rsquo; (since ONLY light Mestizos and Mexican &#8216;whites&rsquo; go to university) underperforming in that racist, caste-ridden society.</p>
