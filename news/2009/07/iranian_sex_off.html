			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Rollason, Winnipeg Free Press, July 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>He&rsquo;s been branded a danger to girls under the age of 18.</p>
<p>But despite the threat convicted sex offender Farid Noedost still poses, he is now allowed to walk free instead of being deported to his native Iran. The decision to release Noedost on parole instead of deporting him came after the Immigration and Refugee Board agreed his fears of being killed in Iran are valid.</p>
<p>But Michael McPhelan of the Immigration and Refugee Board, who ordered Noedost to be released from custody on conditions after a hearing on Thursday, said he wasn&rsquo;t convinced the man will not reoffend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have concerns that you are dangerous to the public in Canada,&#8221; McPhelan said via video conference from Vancouver to a Winnipeg courtroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way you have conducted yourself in Canada is despicable. You are a danger to girls under 18.&#8221;</p>
<p>In agreeing with immigration officials, McPhelan said, &#8220;The need to protect the Canadian public is outweighed by the risk you face in your country of origin.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ordered Noedost to follow his current parole conditions, which include not being around female minors and meeting with a parole officer weekly, and added requirements for him to meet with immigration officials monthly and to notify them if he changes his address or job.</p>
<p>The public is not normally notified of a sex offender&rsquo;s whereabouts while he is on probation, but must rely on probation officials to monitor him.</p>
<p>Noedost shouldn&rsquo;t be able to walk out of prison and have his safety put ahead of the safety of Canadians he&rsquo;ll be living among, provincial justice critic Kelvin Goertzen said in response to the board&rsquo;s decision. &#8220;It&rsquo;s disturbing and most people will be disturbed by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goertzen said if immigration officials think there is an imminent threat to Noedost in Iran, he should &#8220;at the very least, still be incarcerated,&#8221; and be deported when the threat no longer exists.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is recognition that he still poses a threat to (Canadian) society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noedost was sentenced to three years in prison in December 2007 for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and given a three-year suspended sentence and probation for a sexual assault conviction in April 2008.</p>
<p>Noedost was arrested in 2006 after two girls, aged 16 and 15, said they were abused by the man on three occasions after passing out from drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Noedost was taken into custody by immigration authorities after being released on parole from Stony Mountain Correctional Institution.</p>
<p>Noedost was slated for mandatory deportation because his sentence was a federal term of more than two years.</p>
<p>But Thursday&rsquo;s hearing was held after concerns arose for Noedost&rsquo;s safety in Iran. He has a warrant for his arrest after escaping from Iran years ago and he has become a Christian since incarcerated. Noedost came to Canada years ago as a refugee. Details of his refugee status are protected because of privacy concerns, but he was granted permanent resident status in 2001.<br/>

		<p>Why is the safety of the convicted criminal put above that of the general public? He should be sent back to Iran and let this be a deterrent to immigrants who violate our laws. Does any non-Western country have scruples about sending a criminal immigrant back? Why are we such suckers? The Immigration and Refugee Board gets to feel all noble and self-righteous while putting our girls at more risk. If he rapes a girl I hope the victim can sue this stupid &amp; disgusting board.</p>

		<p>If this guy is a muslim and his victims were NOT MUSLIMS, he faces no danger in Iran or any other muslim country for that matter. When he strikes another Canadian female, I hope the girl sues the pants off of someone.</p>

<p>This is another reason for Canadian parents to raise their children in a paranoid cocoon, on a short leash, with a GPS tracking device in their shoes.<br/>
(And then we wonder why our kids seem so molly coddled?) </p>
<p>Because some foreign undesirable has &#8216;rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t we all?</p>

		<p>Noedost should be deported because he is not a Canandian.  I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s much of a threat to teenagers.  Girls that age know what they&rsquo;re doing, and the marxist Canadian school system encourages promiscuity anyway.  They chose to get drunk with this guy on three occasions, and probably turned him in because he wouldn&rsquo;t do something they wanted.  Being a muslim, I&rsquo;ll be he had his sister when she was about that age.</p>

		<p>The BNP and Channel 4 in Britain have been trying to raise awareness of something that is common across the Western world: Muslim men targetting young white females using drugs for sex. </p>
<p>Drugs are a way of life from Morocco to Pakistan, as is the oppression and abuse of women.  In the West many youth are looking for recreation involving drugs, and it&rsquo;s a mark of our Western civilization that females are free to associate with whomever they please. The combination of a male-dominated Muslim culture and a free Western culture is toxic.</p>
<p>The Muslim male in the West has contempt for our white freedoms and values.  According to the Koran and Islamic values, they have permission to enslave infidels.  Drugs are the cross-cultural weapon of choice to lure and coerce white females into sexual servitude.</p>
<p>The Muslim, with his Muslim morality, doesn&rsquo;t believe exploitation of white females is wrong. They believe that if white males don&rsquo;t keep their females under supervision (the way Muslims do), then they&rsquo;re fair game.  As for Western laws, those aren&rsquo;t even recognized as Mohammed&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p>You will see them in groups, working like predatory animals, trying to corral the white females away from the white males. It&rsquo;s primal behavior at its most base extreme.  </p>

		<p>The scam is tremendous.  He was not sent back because he converted to Christianity.  He could just as easily said he converted to Bahai.  Go to church a couple times, pretend tobe a believer and join a congregation, and  you get a stay-in-Canada-forever card. </p>
<p>It is like the African women (such as Somalis) from [female circumcising] culture.  All they have to do is say they are afraid of being cut themselves (or of their daughters being cut if they are too old) and they get to stay in America.</p>
<p>And onc they are here for good, they can even start chopping their daughters genitals and no one calls them on it.  In Minneapolis, genital mutilation among Somalis is rampant.  </p>
<p>All the doctors know it, all the social workers and reporters know it, but they just keep their mouths shut and keep it out of the papers &#8220;to avoid racial conflict&#8221;.  The doctors and social workers have mandatory child abuse reporting duties and they STILL don&rsquo;t do their duty!</p>
<p>It is sick what the Twin Cities is turning into. Any Muslim can now claim refugee status in any country for any bogus reason and do anything they wish to the residents of that country and never be sent home.  All they have to do is get to America, Europe, or Canada.</p>
<p>What I pray is that some Muslim woman will help a sting operation in the Twin Cities, by going to doctor after doctor and telling them she is having problems with urination due to genital mutilation performed in the Twin Cities.  Then, when the doctor does not report it, she can report him to the Medical Board and the police who can then (1) prosecute the doctor, or (2) be reported to the news media.</p>
