<h1><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124752187967935029.html">Minority Broadcasters Seek Federal Aid</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fawn Johnson, Wall Street Journal, July 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of minority broadcasters asked Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner Monday for financial assistance akin to the aid that has been extended to the financial and auto industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minority-owned broadcasters are close to becoming an extinct species,&#8221; the letter said. &#8220;Even in better economic times, minority broadcasters have historically had difficulties accessing the capital markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The broadcasters told Mr. Geithner they can bounce back if they are given some temporary assistance while the credit markets are slow. &#8220;Unlike the auto business, broadcasting has been healthy for many years,&#8221; their letter said.</p>
<p>The broadcasters appeal follows a proposal sent in May to Mr. Geithner by a group of influential House members asking for a minority broadcaster support program, bridge funding, or government-backed loans.</p>
<p>The House letter was signed by House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D., S.C.) and a group of key committee chairmen, including Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D., Mass.) Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.) and Oversight Committee Chairman Edolphus Towns, (D., N.Y.).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Research from the Internet advocacy group Free Press says minorities own just 7.7% of full power commercial radio stations and 3.2% of full power commercial TV stations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Companies and groups that signed on to the Geithner letter included the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, the Inner City Broadcasting Coalition, the Spanish Broadcasting System, Taxi Productions Inc., and Carter Broadcast Group, Inc.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Claim they need handouts just as the auto-makers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course they need handouts.  Has anyone ever heard of blacks supporting anything but destructive things to themselves and their children?</p>

		<p>Here is my experience with &#8220;minority&#8221; broadcasters:KPOO is a black oriented low wattage radio station in Berkeley, CA.I havent listened to them for many years now, but when I did;they broadcasted a constant litany of kill Whitey rap so called music,their favorite kill Whitey (c)rappers was a group called the Last Poets.And they always had something bad to say about Whitey.And they got all of their support from tax moolah, paid for by whitey. </p>

I listen to local black radio talk shows. During the call ins, the same 5 to 10 people call. The hosts are asking for sponsors from their guests.</p>
<p>Few people listen to black radio stations that don&rsquo;t specialize in ghetto rap.</p>

		<p>One would have thought, that given the tens of thousands of highly qualified graduates from HBCU facilities, the resultant myriad of successful black owned and operated businesses would be only too pleased to support their local black radio stations. For example, advertising all those black-only supermarkets which have received much attention in the media for years and so would surely be pleased to announce their ongoing thriving customer base and constant expansion. Perhaps they could use the opportunity to promote their special black-only credit facilities. In turn, the stores could promote the black radio stations and sell CDs of popular violent rap groups. Should be good for inter-business partnerships with other black organisations too then they wouldn&rsquo;t need any evil whitey money.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure Obama will suppport this.  He never rejects any sort of spending, especially for non-whites.  La Raza is demanding that any health care bill that passes must not discriminate against illegal immigrants.  So any sick person in the world can sneak into this country and pick your pocket to pay for his health care.  I&rsquo;m certain that Obama will agree with La Raza.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s illegal and unconstitutional for the government to give money to people or groups based on their race. However, I&rsquo;m sure our government will find a way to break the law while getting credit for their empathy and sensitivity.</p>

		<p>Minority-owned broadcast stations, for obvious reasons, have difficulty in attracting advertisers, the source of broadcast revenue. Most who advertise with them do so as a form of charity, a sentiment which is in short supply in tough times.</p>
<p>In any event, these stations seem to serve little public purpose, save grievance mongering, propagation of bizarre white conspiracy theories, and glorification of base ignorance.</p>

<p>I would call that a great public service, opening white people&rsquo;s eyes up to black hate.  I want more talk radio shows like Jared Taylor, James Edwards and the Council of Conservative Citizens.  But if we can&rsquo;t have that, I&rsquo;ll be happy with each city having five such of these radio stations.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve created a culture of handouts in this country that is deeply and irreversably embedded in several generations now, and a product of that culture is the so-called leader of the country now. The &#8216;gimme&rsquo; mentality so deeply embedded because it was created for minorities and always works. Beg for and receive what others work and pay for and do it within the guaranteed parameters of the race card and you (providing you are a minority) are assured of freebies. All whites have to do is wait (and not much longer) until we are clearly the minority and use the same tricks on them.  The problem is, when the tipping point is reached (and not much longer), the country will be bankrupt, degenerated into third world status, and there won&rsquo;t BE a country, much less freebies to hand out. </p>

		<p>I already see it coming down the road.  Anybody that does not advertise their product on a minority radio station will be vilified as a &#8220;racist&#8221; and their products should be boycotted to the point they are put out of business.  Obama will appoint a &#8220;Advertising Czar&#8221; that will enforce this.  This may sound ridiculous to some but it&rsquo;s not any worse than what has already taken place under this Obamination Administration thus far. </p>

		<p>Nice timing:  I was on my way back to STL to take care of some things over the weekend, and I was flipping around the dial.  The AM black gospel music station in St. Louis, KATZ, now has a Saturday morning talk show hosted by St. Louis&rsquo;s first black mayor, Freeman Bosley Jr.  His co-host is (I think) noted local community agitator Jamala Rogers.</p>
<p>And I got quite an education on that show.  Among the things I found out were:</p>
<p>(1) Everybody in prison is innocent.  White racist cops and prosecutors are out to get them.  Complicating things are incompetent public defenders.  </p>
<p>(2) Black men never commit first degree murder.  </p>
<p>(3) Middle aged to elderly black women thank God when their son gets out of Jeff City, for a 7-year bid for armed robbery, a 9-year bid for crack dealing, or a 14-year bid for 2nd degree murder.  Evidently, God is only to be thanked when the white racist &#8220;man&#8221; decides to swing open the prison door.  God certainly wasn&rsquo;t to be feared 10 to 20 years earlier when said women were raising said sons, not teaching them about morality and sin, and the lack thereof when it comes to armed robbery, crack dealing and murder.  </p>
<p>(4) Black people come up with every excuse in the book, in fact they have written the book, on how to get out of jury duty.  But they shouldn&rsquo;t do this and serve on juries.  NOT because Bosley and Rogers want you to be a public spirited citizen, but because &#8220;it&rsquo;s the only way to keep our &#8216;menz&rsquo; folk from going off to the pen.&#8221;</p>
<p>KATZ is owned by Clear Channel.</p>
