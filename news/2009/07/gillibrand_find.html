<h1>Gillibrand Finds New Ground on Reform</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Falvella-Garraty, Irish Echo Online, July 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Even as she faces into a battle for her Senate seat next year against Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is moving away from her onetime opposition stance on immigration reform. </p>
<p>In doing so she has received strong support from the Obama White House and her fellow New York senator, Charles Schumer, both powerful allies, as she girds herself to fight to retain her seat in the now to be contested 2010 Democratic primary. </p>
<p>At the recent Irish American Democrats political action committee fundraiser in Washington, Sen. Gillibrand signaled a sea change in direction on dealing with the millions of illegal immigrants in the U.S. </p>
<p>&#8220;I pledge that I will work with you,&#8221; said Gillibrand to the crowd of newly elected and re-elected members of the House of Representatives, most of whom back immigration reform proposals that include elements of amnesty for those, including thousands of Irish, currently living in the U.S. illegally. </p>
<p>&#8220;I know the importance of immigration reform, we need to work to have it with family re-unification as a priority,&#8221; said Gillibrand. </p>
<p>Before the gathering that day, Gillibrand joined Schumer and Senators Edward Kennedy and Robert Menendez in re-introducing the Reuniting Families Act, a measure designed to help families separated over visa issues. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gillibrand chose not to co-sponsor the same legislation when she represented upstate New York as a House member. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a variety of groups advocating rights for immigrants, Gillibrand has previously opposed driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegal immigrants and has been a proponent of local law enforcement checking on immigration status of those brought into custody. But there now appears to be a big difference between how she represents the entire state of New York and a single House district, the 20th. </p>
<p>In April, Gillibrand co-sponsored the Dream Act legislation that would allow the children of immigrants, no matter what their legal status, to receive in-state tuition rates at college. <br>
By contrast, in 2008, as a member of the House, she voted in favor of the E-Verify bill that would allow verification of a potential employee&rsquo;s immigration status. The following year, she voted to stage a vote on the same bill when it reached the Senate in March 2009. </p>

		<p>I love Irish literature and folk music. Yeats, Joyce, Synge-the best.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

Deport every damn illegal Irish immigrant. We know what Guinness and Harp, Jameson and Old Bushmills are. We don&rsquo;t need you anymore.</p>
<p>In fact, first send our Gaelic kin to Mexico with deported Mexicans and let them figure out how to get back to Ireland.  A four leaf clover might help. (Irish illegals: In case you didn&rsquo;t know, the Troubles are over!)</p>

		<p>Gillibrand is just one more Tool in the Socialist box. By far, Carolyn McCarthy, her name is Not Maloney, is the worst we have ever had. </p>
<p>McCarthy uses the death of her husband, and that of her wounded son, by Black Sociopath, Colin Ferguson, who shot and killed six people on the Long Island Rail Road, on their way home from work, from New York City, to push for Marxist Gun Control Laws. </p>
<p>McCarthy fails to realize that if there were armed Passengers on that Commuter Train, when Colin Ferguson drew his weapon to shoot people, her Husband and son, as well as others, could have been spared, by the action of Armed and Trained Citizens.  </p>
<p>Instead, McCarthy would rather see her Constituents ride Rail Roads, Subways, and Busses with deranged Maniacs, many of which are simply let out of Mental Hospitals, due to the lack of Federal and State Funds to &#8220;Treat&#8221; them, all the while putting innocent people going to, and from work, at risk of Violent Crime. </p>
<p>Gillibrand is shaping up to be no better than McCarthy. As the new kid on the block, Gillibrand was &#8220;Mentored&#8221; by lighter than loafers, Chuck Schumer. </p>
<p>Gillibrand, who once expressed outrage over the National Illegal Immigration problem, when she Represented her Upstate New York Residents, went to Harlem and &#8220;Listend to the Needs of the Hispanic Community&#8221; which of course, included Illegal Aliens. </p>
<p>After Gillibrand, a Small Town girl, was wined and dined by Chuck Schumer, and our gal, Hillary, as well as many other top players in the Democratic Socialist Party, she emerged a Changed Person, with different views on such things as Illegal Immigration. </p>
<p>I guess Champagne and Caviar will have that affect on some people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care where the Illegal Immigrants come from, they are Illegal, and must All Be Deported. If they want to come here, then they can get in line and wait, like everyone else did.</p>

		<p>The Irish who came illegally to America during the eighties and nineties-and eventually legalized-have formed a political alliance with non-white pro-amnesty forces. These Irish are our mortal enemy. I have met quite a few of them. They are incredibly arrogant. They beleive that anyone who enters America has a God-given right to be legalized.The post-1980 Irish immigrants have contributed enormously to the corruption of US immigration policy.</p>
<p>If the post-1980 Irish immigrants had been kicked out of America, tremendous presure back in Ireland to kick out the africans and asians.</p>
<p>I recently spoke to an elderly  nun from Ireland -this past Saturday July fourth-who was complaining bitterly about the africans and asians who have taken over towns and sections of cities in Ireland. She didn&rsquo;t blather on about the blessings of diversity. This never would have happened if Ireland had not been able to export its unemployed young male population to America for the past thirty years.</p>
<p>US immigration policy should never be used as a safety valve  for another nation.</p>

		<p>The first time I became aware of the women, I read an article that stated how tough she was on illegal immigration issues. I thought, hmm a tough Democrat on illegal immigration.  Her sudden &#8220;change&#8221; of views on her previous tough stance on illegal aliens, didn&rsquo;t really shock me, because I saw in Gillibrands face the expression of a political opportunist.(oxymoron?)  My revelation concerning her flip flopping on the issue of illegal immgration and illegal aliens wasn&rsquo;t all a mystery, since she is a democrat, and I suspected the party elite might get to her sooner of later, which did happen. It was said that Senator Charles Schumer took her to the shed for a &#8220;talk.&#8221; Thus, the advice so many Am Ren posters have suggested, don&rsquo;t vote for the party vote for the candidate.</p>
