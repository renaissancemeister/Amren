<h1>For Minorities, the Wait for a Bone Marrow Match Can Be Long</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Val Willingham, CNN, July 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In May, Denise Bertholin got married. She wore a white dress and carried beautiful lilies. She and her groom, Matt Braun, said &#8220;I do&#8221; in front of family and friends.</p>
<p>But instead of getting hitched in the mountains of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, as she&rsquo;d planned, Bertholin took her vows in a hospital chapel at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. That&rsquo;s because three weeks before her wedding, she learned she had a rare form of acute leukemia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As early as February, Bertholin noticed she wasn&rsquo;t feeling like her usual self: She was run down, very tired. She thought it had to do with her job and preparing for her &#8220;big day.&#8221; Then one day toward the end of April, Bertholin could barely make the walk from the parking lot to a drugstore. For all of her 29 years, Bertholin had been thin and in good shape; on this day she knew something was very wrong.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At first, her oncologists tried aggressive chemotherapy. Although the treatment helped, they knew her form of leukemia had a tendency to return. Her lead doctor suggested she have a bone marrow transplant, saying it was the best way to attack the cancer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A bone marrow transplant is one of the best ways to fight acute leukemia, say experts. Bone marrow is the spongy substance found inside large bones. It produces stem cells that turn into new red and white blood cells, and platelets. Allogeneic means the transplanted bone marrow comes from a matched donor  &mdash;  preferably a family member.</p>
<p>In Bertholin&rsquo;s case, no one in her family was a perfect match. Her next step was to join a national bone marrow registry called Be The Match Registry.</p>
<p>But she faced an obstacle: Bertholin is Latina. According to Dr. Jeffrey Chell, the chief executive officer of the National Marrow Donor Program which runs Be The Match, only 9 percent of people on the registry are Hispanic. &#8220;That&rsquo;s not enough,&#8221; says Chell.</p>
<p>Each year, thousands of people with different forms of cancer turn to the National Bone Marrow Registry for transplants. Seven million people are listed on the registry, but a very small percentage of them are from minority groups. That&rsquo;s unfortunate, says Chell, because &#8220;your background, your heritage is absolutely critical in finding a match.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Chell, joining the registry is easy: It involves taking a simple swab of the inside of your cheek to determine your tissue type and mailing it off. (You can also register in person.) Your name then goes on the list. If you&rsquo;re called to donate, and are deemed healthy enough, bone marrow is extracted  &mdash;  or harvested  &mdash;  usually from the hip.</p>

		<p>The last I read on this subject, they were finding too few non-white donors because non-whites were afraid whites would receive their organs. Bertholin has only this short-sighted hatred to thank for her situation. </p>

<p>And for Mulattoes like Obama the wait could turn into failure, because I&rsquo;m not sure a black white mix can find a transplant that will &#8220;take.&#8221;  Neither the mother or father could be donors.<br>

		<p>The same can be said about donating blood.  I have been giving blood for years at the Saginaw Community Blood Center and have never seen a black in there donating blood.  All of them have been white. </p>

		<p>Somehow I doubt that even 9% of the people in the bone donor registry are Hispanic.  They are presently, what, 13% of the population?  I find it hard to believe that a demographic group that has five times the homicide rate of Whites, and far exceeds us in all other forms of social pathology, is only underrepresented by a third in a category of altruistic behavior.  Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but if I am, I&rsquo;d be curious to know what might account for the anomaly.  </p>

<p>I think the ACTUAL figure is about 17% or even 18% if 15  million illegals are counted.</p>
<p>Officially, I think the government published figures a few years ago which indicated about 14 point something for legal ones, increasing yearly, which put them well ahead of blacks in numbers.  </p>
<p>I read an article the other day which alleged the black population figure has been reduced to something like 12.4%, because of the Hispanic surge.</p>

		<p>Yes I think it is generally believed the blacks won&rsquo;t donate blood or organs because they figure it will go to whites.</p>
<p>But think about it (even if it is true).</p>
<p>Blacks would rather help no one than help a white person.</p>
<p>How childish and yes, racist.</p>

		<p>What the &hellip;?  Does this mean that there are differences in the races?  That would be contradictory to the old liberal mantra of every man being the same as every other man, wouldn&rsquo;t it?  So now, we are to assume there might be natural differences in the various races?</p>

<p>This is true.  But they expect Whites to hand over our precious organs whenever they need them  &mdash;  and it seems the health industry is all for this.  The entire donor industry has become politicized to favor non-Whites over Whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Nationwide, blacks make up more than 30 percent of all organ donor recipients but only 20 percent of all donors&hellip;.. more than 80,000 are waiting for an organ transplant, half of them minorities..&#8221;</p>
<p>And there are plans to apply AA to organ donations that favor blacks (even though they won&rsquo;t donate).</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The United Network for Organ Sharing says that&hellip; they are surreptitiously redesigning the organ allocation system in order to increase the number of blacks who receive transplants&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/lddydc</p>
<p>Get your name off  any organ donation list now.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; I have been giving blood for years at the Saginaw Community Blood Center and have never seen a black in there donating blood&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>When I learned from &#8216;Paved Withe Good Intentions&rsquo;  that blacks refuse to give blood or donate organs because they&rsquo;re afraid a White might be the recipient and a poster here named &#8216;White Nurse&rsquo; wrote that the health industry is conspiring to favor blacks to receive scarce organs over Whites,  I immediately removed my name from the organ donation data base  &mdash;   I told my family I do not want my organs donated (this is in writing) and will not donate the organs of my children or husband.</p>
<p>It will be over my dead body that an illegal immigrant, prison inmate or black receives my organs or those of my loved ones.</p>
<p>And this from Brimelow:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;124 undocumented immigrants donated organs in 2001, while 258 received them&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;four Japanese criminal kingpins &mdash; &rsquo;vindictive and brutal&rsquo; &mdash; received taxpayer funded liver transplants at the UCLA Medical Center&hellip;. during 2000-2004, a period described by the Times as one of &#8220;pronounced organ shortage&#8221;&hellip; 186 Los Angeles residents died waiting&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/lygvnd</p>
<p>I will not be any part of a system that openly discriminates against Whites.  If non-Whites want organs, blood or bone marrow, let them go to their own people, not mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;More than 75,000 Americans are on the federal transplant waiting list. Only 24,000 organs are available each year. Each year, while on the waiting list, more than 5,300 people die&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You can bet with the new socialized medicine scheme, AA will be applied in all areas of health care to favor non-Whites  &mdash;  but Whites will pay for it.  I fear there will come a time when &#8216;donations&rsquo; will not be voluntary.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;ve given blood a couple of times at the university and don&rsquo;t remember seeing any minorities giving blood. Is this an exception or a coincidence?  I honestly don&rsquo;t know and can&rsquo;t draw a conclusion. I do know the blood plasma clincs that pay for blood seem to get there share of minorities. </p>

		<p>Well, of course not. Food stamps and welfare are not handed out when giving blood or signing organ donor cards. My most memorable experiences of blacks and medical procedures of any kind are:</p>
<p>A mother hollering at her unruly child in a doctor&rsquo;s office, &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t shuddup I&rsquo;m gonna have that nurse give you a shot with the biggest needle they got!&#8221;</p>
<p>And overheard through exam room walls in an Orthopedist&rsquo;s office, who wanted a black woman to have a dye study of her knee joint, trying in vain to explain the procedure to her, and her repeated reactions were loud, &#8220;Nossir! I ain&rsquo;t gwanna do it!! Dye&rsquo;ll make you die!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks certainly aren&rsquo;t going to subject themselves to any medical procedure that either doesn&rsquo;t pay or isn&rsquo;t vital to their survival.</p>

<p>I support making organ donation mandatory.  There is no reason people should die because of superstitious backwards beliefs or mean spirited refusal to donate organs. </p>
<p>The dead are dead they don&rsquo;t need them, the living do. We aren&rsquo;t ancient egyptians who believe in mumifying our dead, the organs will just rot in the grave anyway, might as well save a life.</p>
<p>Or perhaps a better way would be to only give organs to those who sign up to be organ donors. If you don&rsquo;t want to give up your organs when you die, then fine you don&rsquo;t get them if you need a transplant. </p>

<p>I will never agree with this!</p>
<p>Giving the government the power to desecrate my loved ones&rsquo; remains over MY objections?  Are you kidding?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that the government forcefully redistributes a huge portion of the fruits of my labor while I&rsquo;m alive, I&rsquo;ll be ** if they&rsquo;ll confiscate MY organs or those of my loved ones for non-White,  AA-distribution.</p>
<p>Are YOU OK with this?</p>
<p>I believe it is a desecration of my loved ones&rsquo; remains and it cheapens life.  <br>
I and I only, as my loved ones&rsquo; next of kin, will decide what to do with the remains, NOT the government.  </p>
<p>Native Americans routinely raise hell whenever what they believe to be old Indian bones are unearthed and have demanded legislation that such bones be handed over to them for a respectful burial according to their beliefs.  They believe handling these bones is a desecration of their ancestors.  </p>
<p>I feel the same way about my loved ones and believe their bodies should be treated with respect, even after death, not torn apart, against my wishes, by government mandate.</p>
<p>Does the government also get to make the pronouncement as to when death occurs?</p>
<p>I wonder if others feel the same way as you?</p>
<p>You also write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;If you don&rsquo;t want to give up your organs when you die, then fine you don&rsquo;t get them if you need a transplant&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Who gets to play God over life and death? Who gets to decide who does and does not get a precious, scarce organ?  You? obama? ted kennedy?</p>
<p>As I am WHITE, I would be last in line for an organ anyway  &mdash;  after blacks, illegal immigrants, foreign nationals, hispanics  &mdash;  so what would it matter to me?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll be d***** if MY organs or those of my loved ones will be a part of yet one more anti-White, government-mandated scheme.</p>

		<p>In the 1970&rsquo;s in Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital in the UK, a victim of a motorcycle accident was admitted to the A&E; dept, when the nurse found a donor card they  STOPPED trying to save his life and instead removed his two kidneys, he later regained consciousness but of course it was only a matter of time ( days ) before he died.Since that time I have been reluctant to put my name down as a donor.</p>
