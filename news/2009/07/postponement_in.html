			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Praag (South Africa), July 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The trial of a black man accused of trafficking in stolen body parts was postponed on Monday, Mpumalanga police said.</p>
<p>Philemon Batulekile Baloyi, 48, appeared in the Acornhoek Magistrate&rsquo;s Court where he faces charges of possession and violation of a corpse, said Captain Leonard Hlathi.</p>
<p>He was arrested on June 20 after he allegedly attempted to sell the breast and &#8220;manicured left hand&#8221; of a woman to an inyanga  &mdash;  a traditional healer.</p>
<p>Baloyi allegedly bought the parts from Ben Mongadi, 35, a casual worker at Doves Funerals in Lydenburg.</p>
<p>Hlathi said Mongadi, who was also on trial, told police he got the breast and hand from a woman who was due to be cremated.</p>
<p>Police are also investigating a claim by Baloyi that he had sold body parts to five inyangas in the Acornhoek area.</p>
<p>Baloyi would appear again in court on July 20, Mongadi on July 14.</p>
<p>Both men remain in police custody.<br>

		<p>My bet that the description of a &#8220;manicured hand&#8221; would lead me to believe it was the hand of a murdered White woman, anyone know for sure? Nothing on www.zasucks.com about that yet, but there will be. Some real interesting articles there now as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possession and violation of a corpse&#8221; That&rsquo;s a European (civilized) concept. Even corpses are entitled to a certain dignity = European. Corpses can be used for black magic at will = African. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still seeing a strange conglomeration of European and African values mixed together in South Africa. We&rsquo;re going to be seeing more and more of these strange juxtapositions of civilized and savage in SA before the last white leaves.</p>

		<p>This is not the exception; this is widespread.  Google <b>Africa muti body parts</b> and you&rsquo;ll see that <b>black traditional medicine</b> really means <i>mutilating other human beings and using their organs for &#8220;magic.&#8221;</i></p>

		<p>The &#8220;manicured&#8221; hand and breast belonged to a Dutch tourist who was killed earlier in an accident.</p>
<p>It was reported in this article http://jv.news24.com/Rapport/Suid-Afrika/0,,752-2460_2531627,00.html</p>
<p>But as this is an afrikaans newspaper I guess it&rsquo;s of little use here.</p>

<p>Man Arrested Trying To Sell Body Parts</p>
<p>The police unit against organised crime in Mpumalanga arrested a 48 year-old man from Acornhoek after he tried to sell a white woman&rsquo;s severed body parts to a traditional healer (read witchdoctor).</p>
<p>When he approached the traditional healer with the body parts the healer immediately telephoned the police and kept the man busy until they arrived. </p>
<p>The man had tried to sell both a woman&rsquo;s breast and one of her hands.  The suspect told the police that he got the body parts from a mortuary in Lydenburg.</p>
<p>The police believe that the body parts were not obtained from a mortuary, but that the woman was murdered.   </p>
<p>According to police spokesman, Captain Leonard Hlathi, the body parts were in good condition and the police believe the victim was very recently killed.  The fingernails on the hand offered for sale were well cared for.</p>
<p>Hlathi said that the police believe the woman was recently buried without being identified and that her relatives were probably not even aware that she was dead.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s body parts were taken to a state mortuary near Acornhoek and the police investigation continues.</p>
<p>The identity of the man arrested has not been revealed as he is due to appear in court next week.</p>
<p>Hlathi has asked that anyone having information on the incident, or who are missing a family member, to phone him on 082 462 0804.<br>
