<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-07-14-puerto-rico-hospitals_N.htm">Death Rates in Puerto Rican Hospitals Higher Than in States</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Gillum, USA Today, July 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Patients in Puerto Rico die at statistically higher rates from heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia than those admitted to mainland hospitals, a USA TODAY analysis of new government data shows.</p>
<p>While 11.6% of patients in the states admitted for pneumonia die within 30 days, that number rises to almost 15% in Puerto Rico. Death rates for heart attack also crest above average (18.6% vs. 16.5%) and are slightly higher for heart failure (12.1% vs. 11.2%).</p>
<p>And the rate at which patients were readmitted to Puerto Rican hospitals within a month of discharge also edged up, according to the data. In particular, pneumonia patients landed back in a hospital bed 19.4% of the time, vs. 18.2% in the states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet the problem in Puerto Rico may run deeper: The island&rsquo;s several dozen hospitals may lack money for infrastructure, new equipment and more doctors, according to a report last month by the Puerto Rico Health Care Parity Coalition.</p>
<p>The report said Puerto Rico receives about $20 per Medicaid participant vs. $330 in the states, meaning that, all things considered, hospitals may have fewer dollars to spend on facilities and patient care. Since 1997, the report found, Medicaid reimbursement costs in Puerto Rico have increased by more than 300% to roughly $1.7 billion in 2008; federal contributions, meanwhile, have increased by about 96% during that time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Peter Ashkenaz, a spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid services, says Puerto Rico received about $180 million more this fiscal year in payments for federal health care programs, which includes $100 million in federal stimulus money.</p>

		<p>Why the U.S. doesn&rsquo;t just get rid of Peurto Rico I will never understand. I have never been able to see one logical reason for the U.S. to want or desire this poor, resourceless, Spanish-speaking island. </p>

		<p>What would be more telling would be a comparison between Puerto Rico and individual states, such as Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, etc..  Comparing PR to the entire US  is misleading.<br/>

		<p>PuertoRico gets some 22 billion dollars in subsidies every year to keep them afloat.  Even with that much money, as Hispanics they are unable to sustain a first world economy and are forced to live off the white man.  This explains why they, like so many other NAM&rsquo;s, hate white people.  They know they cannot survive without us, and they hate us for it.</p>
<p>Cut &#8216;em loose. WE have no need for them.  Let them survive on their own.</p>

		<p>Only America would give away the world&rsquo;s most vital waterway, the Panama Canal, and retain possession of a financial sinkhole like Puerto Rico, thus allowing its Third World inhabitants legal entry into the US.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before about Puerto Rico, but it bears repeating: The United States doesn&rsquo;t want to give Puerto Rico its independence because it doesn&rsquo;t want Puerto Rico to fall under Cuba&rsquo;s thumb. The USA is afraid Puerto Rico will become a satellite state of Cuba, because it knows Fidel Castro is popular among many Puerto Ricans to this day.</p>
<p>And john (re post #5) Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, even though Puerto Rico is officially classified as a &#8220;trust territory&#8221;. Puerto Ricans on the island pay no federal income tax, since they are not a state - a concession Congress gave them, after they annexed the island from Spain.</p>

		<p>Reply to Soprano Fan:</p>
<p>Even if I agreed with you so what? Let P.R. fall under Cuba&rsquo;s influence. Let Cuba take over P.R. from us if they want it. Do you think some Cuba-P.R. alliance is going to destroy America?</p>
