			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dean Nelson, Telegraph (London), July 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ram Niwas, 25, consulted his uncle a &#8216;tantrik&rsquo; or black magic priest, who told him he and his wife would only give birth to a boy if he killed a young girl in a ritual sacrifice.</p>
<p>The body of Vandana was discovered in a field close to her home in a village in Lakhimpur Kheri district around 100 miles south of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Her body was surrounded by incense sticks which had been used in the tantrik ritual.</p>
<p>Ram Niwas, his uncle, tantrik priest Mewa Lal, 55, and friend Yousef Ansari, 22, were arrested shortly after the discovery.</p>
<p>A man beheaded his neighbour&rsquo;s five-year-old daughter after being told by his uncle, a self-proclaimed tantrik (witch doctor), that only a human sacrifice would enable his wife to give birth to a healthy male child.</p>
<p>The gruesome ritual took place in a village in Lakhimpur Kheri district, 150km south of Lucknow on Tuesday. Ram Niwas, 25, who beheaded the child, his uncle, Mewa Lal, 55, and an associate, Yousuf Ansari, 22, have been arrested, the police said.</p>
<p>The three men confessed to their crime shortly after the body was discovered on Tuesday evening, said local police station officer Ravi Srivastava. Niwas told detectives he had turned to his Tantrik uncle because he and his wife had suffered fertility problems.</p>
<p>The case highlights India&rsquo;s chronic levels of female infanticide. An article in The Lancet revealed that 10 million female foetuses had been aborted in the last 20 years by women who wanted a son, while campaigners say many newborn girls are murdered at birth and recorded as stillborn.</p>
<p>Girls are widely regarded as a financial burden by Indian families because of high dowry demands from the families of prospective grooms.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The case highlights India&rsquo;s chronic levels of female infanticide&#8221;</p>
<p>Infanticide? The girl was five years old; that&rsquo;s not infanticide, that&rsquo;s Homicide. Why did the writer even throw this in? Is he such a cold, cynical activist that he&rsquo;ll use anything to advance the PC agenda of the day? Or is he so conditioned by the multi-cult that he automatically sees everything through the lens of the Left?</p>
<p>I swear I don&rsquo;t which is creepier, the Tantric cultists in the article or the multi-cultist who wrote this ridiculous piece&hellip;.</p>

<p>Yes, this is the diversity the multicults want to bring to our country.</p>
<p>Be a shame wouldn&rsquo;t it if these same multicults who despise the restrictions they believe Christianity puts on them to be trapped in a society that rigorously enforces sharia law.</p>
<p>For the first time in their lives they will confront fanatics that are every bit as rabid as they are.  The merging of the two would be a great justice, with constant reminders that to be careful what they work for,because they just might get it.</p>
<p>And it couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch of whackos.</p>

		<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject, if this keeps getting too out of hand in India, then the country&rsquo;s population will be in danger if shrinking, though some might not see very much danger in that.  Similarly, I&rsquo;m sure that some of you reading my words have secretly hoped beyond hope that pandemic black-on-black crime and gang wars would contribute to black auto-genocide.  It won&rsquo;t happen, and here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p>Imagine there are 10 human beings on Earth, all of them of reproductive age.  There are nine men and one woman.  Every nine months, the woman can have one child (assume no multiple births here).  So in 9 months, the population will be 11.  In 1.5 years, the population will be 12.  In 2.25 years, the population will be 13.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s flip the scenario, and say there&rsquo;s one man and nine women.  Nine months from now, nine new babies, the population is 19.  In 1.5 years, the population is 28.  In 2.25 years, the population is 37.</p>
<p>As you can see, the higher a percentage of your population is women of reproductive age, the faster your population growth can be.  Killing women of reproductive age (or soon to be reproductive age) puts a dent in your population growth quickly.  Likewise, in big American cities and Africa, the violence is almost entirely man on man, and rarely involves women, of rep.age or sooner.  For there to be a population drop among blacks, girls and women of rep.age would have to be dying or being killed in pandemic quantities, and if that hasn&rsquo;t happened by now, it never will.</p>

		<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the kind of story that should be read to all those liberal, white self-haters; they might finally understand that in some foreign countries, they have valus and beliefs quite different from our own. And that if multiculturalism means people from countries like that coming here to live among us, while trying to reproduce the way they lived in their places of origin, well, we could end up in real trouble.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read somewhere on the BBC website or it could&rsquo;ve been an Indian one thousands of kids are killed in &#8220;Kali&#8221; sacrifices like this one where impoverished Indians hoping to get rich kill poor children of their unfortunate Indian population.</p>

<p>Good points but remember it&rsquo;s women who have the highest AIDS.  Black women I believe are 20X more likely than white women to have it vs 8X with men.  And it is in Africa where women have incredible AIDS rates eg S Africa where I beleive it&rsquo;s 25% of pregnant women.  That could soon dent their pop. growth.</p>

		<p>I think that Tantra is a form or ritual of Hinduism, not Islam.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter; what happened is barbaric, and it just goes to show that India, which has on the one hand some of the most advanced spiritual beings in the world, ALSO has some of the most ignorant, cruel and lowest of the low-class people on the planet.  It wasn&rsquo;t so long ago that married women there were forced to participate in &#8220;suttee&#8221; - that&rsquo;s where if her husband dies first, the wife is obligated to jump onto his funeral pyre and burn to death to be with him (and if she didn&rsquo;t do it voluntarily she was thrown on by the dead man&rsquo;s relatives).  Real good incentive to get married, eh, girls?  I have heard from people from India that this custom is still practiced in some of the small and isolated villages there.  It seems that the most horrific practices are committed by the least educated and most isolated peoples in India - and I imagine it&rsquo;s pretty much the same everywhere else.  Poverty does not beget gentility.  I&rsquo;d say there are better ways to control the population levels&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d find it infinitely preferable to be the victim of infanticide, than to grow up as a woman in India.  And it&rsquo;s a toss up as to whether I&rsquo;d rather be decapitated as a five-year-old, or to grow up as a woman in India.  I&rsquo;ve seen wealthy, educated, Indians treating their wives and mothers like wayward dogs. I shudder to think how the less affluent and enlightened Indians treat their womenfolk.</p>
<p>Perhaps India wouldn&rsquo;t be such a horrible, impoverished place, if women there were not stunted, thwarted, and belittled, at every stage of their lives.  How could any country prosper when half its population is prevented from contributing meaningfully to the GDP.</p>
<p>I live in a Southern metropolis filled with luxurious homes.  In most cases, those fine houses, and the comfortable lives they represent, came about, in part, as the result of three generations of working women. And our white population is stable.  Working ENABLES these women to have families.</p>
<p>If we have any cultural contact with third-world nations, at all, it should be to EXPORT our successful way of life, rather than to IMPORT people and ideologies that only lead to poverty and misery.  </p>

<p><br>
Not all female students are as you say.  Plenty of &#8220;Asian&#8221; females are into the diversity thing-look how many are in America demanding rights they say they are entitled to.  If they aren&rsquo;t into the diversity thing as you say=why don&rsquo;t they all go back to Asia.  There are lots of bisexual and promsicuous Asians-part of the &#8216;diversity culture.&rsquo;  There is also effort on the part of Asians to try to get whites to pay for reparations-Senator Fong in California for instance and then there is the Asian woman who recently tried to sue Ciley Myrus for making a face and the Asian starting whining about discrimination.  Then there are the ones that work those infamous massage parlors and the countless gang members.  And last but not least, there have been numerous articles in the news, including Amren, where Asian women have sold US technology overseas-fortunately some have gotten caught.  They aren&rsquo;t exactly the nice people they are made out to be and I&rsquo;ll put a Brit up against any Asian when it comes to a test of intelligence.  Asians haven&rsquo;t really invented anything-they can memorize/mimic, but that&rsquo;s about it. </p>
