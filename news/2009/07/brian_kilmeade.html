			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Drivasm, Huffington Post, July 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Brian Kilmeade apologized Monday for controversial comments he made on the July 8 episode of &#8220;Fox and Friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>The controversy arose when Kilmeade and his co-hosts were discussing a Swedish and Finnish study which found that married people were less susceptible to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease than unmarried ones. Kilmeade downplayed the study&rsquo;s significance in America, saying &#8220;we [Americans] keep marrying other species and other ethnicities .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Swedes have pure genes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in America we marry everybody .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comment prompted an outcry for an apology, including a petition from UNITY: Journalists of Color, Inc., which said that Kilmeade&rsquo;s statement was based on &#8220;the basest of white supremacist ideologies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Kilmeade apologized this morning, saying &#8220;I made comments that were offensive to many people. That was not my intention, and looking back at those comments I realize they were inappropriate. For that I sincerely apologize. America [is a] huge melting pot, and that is what makes us such a great country.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Being a &#8220;melting pot&#8221; made us a great country in the past, but that was when all the ingredients were of European extraction.</p>
<p>The melting pot became a curse when multiculturalism and diversity took root and the third world became part of the mix. That is when the melting pot became something that will destroy our country. </p>
<p>Some call it a &#8220;salad bowl&#8221; these days. Same end result, though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that myself.  The few times when I have been able to, I have asked someone who tells me &#8220;our diversity is our strength&#8221; (ODIOUS) to tell me why.  Their answers always define what diversity is, as if something is good because of its definition, but that&rsquo;s not telling me why ODIOUS.  Someone I knew was in this same situation, and the diversocrat came up with the half-baked answer that diversity helps American corporations market to a diverse world.  Except that Japanese, Chinese and Korean electronics companies don&rsquo;t need a diverse Japan, China and Korea to sell cell phones and TVs to people in Bombay, Oslo, Rio and the southside of Chicago.</p>

		<p>Are not many diseases as well as the ability to resist them GENETIC?  Resistance to Alzheimers for Swedes can be genetic just as breast cancer can be in Jews. Unless Mr. Kilmeade was just blowing out his backside, then he is not out of line to quote science.  </p>

		<p>Commenting on anything that doesn&rsquo;t support the ludicrous rainbow society, is taboo.</p>
<p>Not only isn&rsquo;t it permitted to say anything about wanting to live apart with your own kind, it&rsquo;s an absolute necessity to buy into the obnoxious propaganda that diversity is our strength when an examination of the claim proves unequivocally that diversity is our utmost weakness and will be the one main factor that will destroy this country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s George Orwell&rsquo;s Big Brother society without the totalitarian control by the government.  Like minded media takes over the control of making people&rsquo;s minds &#8220;right.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had a chance at one time of turning things around, but as soon as complete leftist control of the media came about that chance was lost for good.</p>
<p>Many have warned that all multicultural societies eventually collapse, most into violence and chaos, but it&rsquo;s all ignored in favor of playing a game of &#8220;let&rsquo;s pretend.&#8221; </p>
<p>And since most all people are preoccupied with their own survival, Thoreau&rsquo;s observation that &#8220;Most men lead lives of quiet desperation,&#8221; certainly rings true nowadays.  We will continue concentrating on immediate matters while the manipulators and propagandists contine to control public thought, generally.</p>
<p>And, like all other similar societies before us, we will continue on with this insanity until the country is no more.</p>

<p>Diversity is well defined. These people love their official paperwork. To define diversity one only need look at the organizations that have official diversity programs, and matching diversity and inclusion statements and guidelines, and often sensitivity training or orientation too. Every place that values diversity promotes discrimination against white men, and reduce white men to persons beneath consideration or inclusion in the diversity agenda. Not only that but these same &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; folks see no problem at all in degrading and in fact blaming white men for any and all problems that don&rsquo;t measure up to proper &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>Question Diversity:</p>
<p>         I remember when I was on an official trip to India and was arguing with an Indian guy (American green card holder) about diversity in the west. During the debate we realised that more the number of Indians in a particular country less likely are you to find a product from than country in the local shops. You can hardly find American, South African, Fijian, Malay or British (all nations with large Indian populations) products sold in Indian shops. Most products are Japanese, Korean(Samsung, LG, Hyundai etc&hellip;), Finnish (Nokia), Czech (Skoda), German etc&hellip;, nations which have very few Indians residing in them. India&rsquo;s defence forces buy billions of dollars of Russian military hardware (Sukhois, T-90s etc&hellip;) every year but there are very few Indians living in Russia. It is as if diversity hinders the ability of corporations to market to a diverse world.</p>

		<p>racial diversity is the opposite of miscegnation.</p>
<p>if you mix 100 ethnicies together, you get 1.</p>
<p>1 is less than 100.</p>
<p>the only way to maintain racial &amp; ethnic diversity is for like to mate with like. </p>
<p>scandinavians are tiny groups of indigeneous people, they should defend their homelands, expel foreigners, and safeguard their genetic heritage. </p>

		<p>Aaron and Question Diversity</p>
<p>The kind of diversity that&rsquo;s currently deemed to be our strength is in fact the potential energy for ethnic strife.  History is replete with it, and we ignore it at our peril.  When sufficiently divergent and insular peoples occupy the same land, a change in their proportions that shifts the balance of power will create conflict, particularly if the prosperity that gave everyone more than they wanted to lose evaporates.  No, this kind of diversity is not a strength, it&rsquo;s a powder keg of ethnic tension.  </p>

		<p>We know little about Alzheimer. The Finnish allegation that marriage prevents Alzheimer&rsquo;s is absurd. What if someone is married and divorces after five, ten, twentyyears? What if tow people happily live together without formal marriage? So the study is flawed. </p>
<p>As for Brian Kilmeade, he is right about intermarriage because it kills culture, and white culture has all it can handle right now. </p>
<p>But somehow he tried to make it relate to the Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease question. He&rsquo;s not a doctor so he knows less than the guesstimating Scandinavian medical researchers. </p>
<p>An absurd &#8220;problem&#8221; that is irrelevant from the serious question of racial integrity biologically and culturally. No one involved here seemed qualified to discuss this in a dispassionate manner. Result was the usual racist charges and the chagrined speaker desperate to save his job from  the black racist mob and their white apologists.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t really see anything racist at all about the comment. He just said we marry different ethnicities. Big deal. What&rsquo;s racist about that? The different species was probably meant as a joke, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean he is inferring a certain race. </p>
<p>He was too quick to apologize. It only makes him look weak. How often do we see liberals and blacks apologize?</p>

		<p>The position that diversity is &#8220;good&#8221; implicitly says that different groups being different things to the table.  Some of these things and characteristics are inarguably more desirable than others. </p>
<p><br>
East Asians bring high IQs and a strong work ethic, Causcasians being a high level of inventiveness and creativity, black Africans bring a high level of athletic development, much lower average levels of intelligence, and a low level of self-control and hence criminality.</p>
<p>Which of these diverse characteristics is most beneficial?  Which is least and in fact downright damaging?</p>

		<p>@ feller (15).  I didn&rsquo;t see any claims that marriage prevents Alzheimer&rsquo;s.  All the article says is that married people tend to get it less.  Causation is not even implied.</p>

<p>You are attempting to make the case for the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans. How did Native Born White Americans manage to survive all the years when the Asians were not welcomed into America? Quite well thank you. It is the for decades since two alpha Native Born White American males walked on the moon. Ten more were to follow. WE do not need the Asians.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curious to know how the truth can be racist. If it is, in fact, the truth, (Americans marrying multi-racially, which they do), how can that statement be deemed to be racist? It&rsquo;s exactly like mentioning the race of a criminal - if he is indeed that race, why is it derogatory to say so? Is is not the truth, and aren&rsquo;t we just stating an fact obvious to anyone with sight? By avoiding the mention of [only black] suspects or criminals, aren&rsquo;t we reinforcing the suggestion that it is offensive to simply be black? Or are we actually supposed to lie, so we don&rsquo;t offend someone? Don&rsquo;t worry about the truth, just speak what is acceptable.</p>

		<p>Yesterday evening it was my pleasure to attend a wedding of a young lady we have known well for years and the young man of her choice. It was a lovely ceremony, and aside from the general niceties of such occasions, there was an additional feeling of &#8220;all&rsquo;s right with the world tonight&#8221;. I was standing at the edge of the dance floor, idly contemplating this when I realized why. The entire gathering from infants to grannies was 100% WHITE! There was not one brown or black face anywhere in the crowd of over 200! Flocks of WHITE children with blonde, red, brown and dark hair swooped and ran, playing, shrieking and chattering around the strolling clusters of adults. The wedding and reception was lively, even a little boisterous at times, but there was no excessive drunkeness, no fights, no police called, everyone acted like a civiized human ought to. It&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve seen a 100% White gathering, I had actually forgotten how comforting it is to have NO diversity! Oh, I sincerely hope I live to attend more such gatherings!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Diversity is our strength&#8221; is the war cry of the socialist revolutionaries and cheap labor lobbies.  It gives strength to the Marxists by providing an virtually endless supply of imported voters to swamp the electorate and forever alter our form of government. It gives strength to the corporate CEOs who can flood the labor market with minimum wage slaves, destroy high paying jobs and pocket the savings.  Does diversity benefit the average American?  I&rsquo;d have to have a tangible idea of what the benefits are and yet the diversity czars aren&rsquo;t talking.      </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a very disturbing trend in the under 20 age group.  Some of them may have White skin and caucasian features but their faces barely resemble a White European phenotype.  There&rsquo;s less diversity in eye and hair color and alot more dark hair and eyes.  Their faces are less distinct and in short they don&rsquo;t look like the generation before them.  America needs to get on a eugenics program because our European identity is slowly dissolving.   </p>

&ldquo;I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion [as a judge] than a white male who hasn&rsquo;t lived that life.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>- Sonia Sotomayor</p>
<p>&ldquo;We remain a hunted people. Now you think you have a destiny to fulfill in the land that historically has been ours for forty thousand years. And we&rsquo;re a new Mestizo nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our devil has pale skin and blue eyes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>– Professor Jose Angel Gutierrez, founder of La Raza</p>
<p>&ldquo;Around the year 2040, whites will become a minority in the United States and, believe me, it will be payback time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Pro-Immigration Activist, Jorge Sanchez</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the one idea is, how we are going to exterminate white people because that in my estimation is the only conclusion I have come to. We have to exterminate white people off the face of the planet to solve this problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- African Studies professor, Dr. Kamau Kambon</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blond hair and blue eyes are a biological defect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white race is a disease, and the only cure is a bullet. The rule of whites is history. Soon they will be our serfs. It&rsquo;s now the Age of the Brown Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Hindu nationalist, Ramesh Sharma</p>
<p>&#8220;I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother&rsquo;s white race.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Barack Hussein Obama  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Al-Qaida is not merely for the benefit of Muslims.  That&rsquo;s why I want blacks in America, people of color, American Indians, Hispanics, and all the weak and oppressed in North and South America, in Africa and Asia, and all over the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Al-Zawahri</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists. Make no mistake about it we intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as &lsquo;the white race&rsquo; is destroyed–not &lsquo;deconstructed&rsquo; but destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Jewish studies professor, Noel Ignatiev</p>

		<p>Reg. Asian immigrants: do whites Americans want aliens in the elite? There&rsquo;s more to consider than merely maximizing state productivity within some oversimplified model.</p>
<p>Northeast Asians are wonderful people who&hellip; belong in northeast Asia. When they move here, they take powerful positions within American society. The elite of any society enjoys the bulk of the political power. Jews are already shockingly overrepresented, and bringing in high quality nonwhite immigrants will only install more aliens into positions of power.</p>
<p>All nonwhite immigration is detrimental to the interests of real [white] Americans, and as for the American state it won&rsquo;t endure as a squabbling mass of ethnicities. Babel will crumble.</p>
<p>A prime weakness of focusing arguments on third world incompetence and dysgenic impact is this tendency to miss the importance of blood ties within a real nation that unite it together and to past generations along with inherited traditions and values that have been molded over time. Aliens of any sort disrupt this harmony.</p>
<p>And even were northeast Asians able to miraculously serve white interests within America, they nevertheless would alter the national character. Whites in America should be proud of what they are and wish to defend their genetic and cultural heritage regardless of economic impact.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We Americans keep marrying other species &hellip;&#8221;??</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that the word &#8220;species&#8221; is what&rsquo;s offensive.  I think the world &#8220;Americans&#8221; should stand for &#8220;White&#8221; and the word &#8220;species&#8221; should stand for &#8220;Blacks&#8221;.  But he was afraid to say that and I also think he was afraid to use the word &#8220;race&#8221; so he substituted the word &#8220;species&#8221; for it, not realizing that Blacks are the same species as Whites are - Home Sapiens.  Is this a good thing though - that is - Whites marrying Blacks?  Yes   &mdash;  - for Blacks.  Definitely not for Whites.  They improve their genetic line at the expense of our race.</p>

<p>Interesting!  I&rsquo;ve never heard the <i>melting pot</i> expression referred to also as <i>salad bowl</i>.</p>
<p>However, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, what the Far Left propagandists really mean by the <i>melting pot</i> term, is a miscegenated society.  </p>
<p><i>Diversity</i> is the term they use to describe societies composed of a plethora of alien races and cultures occupying the same living spaces, all being vigourously encouraged AND openly enabled by the Far Left, to retain their respective native languages, literature, cultures, belief systems and traditions, that is, all accept white nationalities.  </p>
<p>The <i>salad bowl</i> description, therefore, is more descriptive of the latter category. <br>

		<p>Feller wrote: We know little about Alzheimer. The Finnish allegation that marriage prevents Alzheimer&rsquo;s is absurd. What if someone is married and divorces after five, ten, twentyyears? What if tow people happily live together without formal marriage? So the study is flawed. </p>
<p>I did not read the study but I would assume they are referring to older people that have long term partners.</p>
<p>The biggest factor to terminal cancer survival rates (regardless of stage) is whether or note the person has a devoted companion/caregiver. Those that have a devoted caregiver survive longer (no doubt because they are encouraged to eat, and encouraged to hang on).</p>
<p>Same could hold true for Alzheimers. New studies show a certain percentage of older people have the physical condition of alzheimers (brain scans) but do not suffer from any demensia. Perhaps being in a relationship (typically meaning a marriage for elderly people) keeps them more active and somehow lowers the risk.</p>

<p>The hindu and pakistani elites have benn entering America for theb past forty years. The pace of this is accelerating. Their intention is to gains control of American immigration and foriegn policy. A prime example of this is Fareed Zakaria who is india born and from a well to do family which has bragged about upper class indian influence in the US goverment. It is laughable to see this character pass himself off as an authentic America. Fake America that he is, he is on the road to being the secretay of State in that other fake America Bobby Jindal&rsquo;s Repuiblican adminstration in 2012. The asianphiles who post here disgust me.</p>
<p>The indian and pakistani community in  America has enormous control over US immigration policy, whereas, millions of ordinary Native Born White Americans have almost no control over American immigration policy. The indians,pakistanis and chinese are a foriegn fifth column in America. They should be deported</p>

Being a &ldquo;melting pot&rdquo; made us a great country in the past, but that was when all the ingredients were of European extraction.</p>
<p>The melting pot became a curse when multiculturalism and diversity took root and the third world became part of the mix. That is when the melting pot became something that will destroy our country. </p>
<p>Some call it a &ldquo;salad bowl&rdquo; these days. Same end result, though.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   That&rsquo;s right. All the people who came here in the 1800&rsquo;s and early 1900&rsquo;s were  Caucasians. All were of the same racial makeup. That&rsquo;s why we had a harmonious existence. Diversity causes nothing but distrust and envy.</p>
