<h1>MD Accuses Officer of Racism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karen Kleiss, Edmonton Journal, July 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Edmonton doctor caught speeding says he was handcuffed, frisked, detained and berated by a police officer because he is of Asian descent, an allegation the officer flatly denies.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Seto admits he was driving more than 50 kilometres over the speed limit, but says the officer breached his constitutional rights by unreasonably searching him, unlawfully detaining him, and administering cruel and unusual punishment by handcuffing him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The manner in which I was treated  &mdash;  the excessive force, the verbal abuse, the unprofessional demeanour  &mdash;  is totally unacceptable,&#8221; Seto told the court. &#8220;I personally feel I would be treated differently had I not been Asian or a minority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seto told the court he could easily have paid the traffic ticket he received for driving 145 km/h in a 90 km/h zone, but he is fighting the ticket as a matter of principle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not wish this to happen to other people  &mdash;  other minorities  &mdash;  who don&rsquo;t have the resources to fight back,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Court heard that on the afternoon of Nov. 23,2008, Const. Wes Thomas pulled up behind Seto&rsquo;s new white Mitsubishi Lancer at the intersection of Anthony Henday Drive and Callingwood Road.</p>
<p>When the light turned green, Seto peeled out of the intersection and accelerated until his speed levelled off at 145 km/h. Thomas followed and pulled Seto over.</p>
<p>The two cars stopped on the shoulder and Thomas used a bullhorn to order the driver out of the car. He demanded that Seto place the keys on the roof, then told him to walk backward toward the rear of his car and put his hands on the trunk.</p>
<p>Thomas then got out of the cruiser, handcuffed Seto, checked him for weapons and took him to sit in the back of the cruiser while he wrote the traffic ticket.</p>
<p>The two men agree on that much, but they told the court two entirely different versions of events.</p>
<p>Seto, a family doctor who counts 8,000 patients in his practice, testified Thomas &#8220;screamed and yelled&#8221; at him, repeatedly threatened to throw him in jail and bragged that only he was allowed to drive that fast. Seto claimed he was handcuffed with &#8220;extreme force&#8221; and that the shackles caused &#8220;extreme pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>His defence lawyer, Deborah Hatch, submitted photographs of Seto&rsquo;s wrists to the court.</p>
<p>Seto claimed he was compliant and apologetic, and that the officer yelled in response: &#8220;Sorry isn&rsquo;t good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor said the officer confiscated the contents of his pockets, including his medical pager, then tossed him into the back of the cruiser and lectured him about speeding for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was intimidating me,&#8221; Seto said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was humiliated. I was belittled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately after the incident, Seto drove to his lawyer&rsquo;s house. Seto&rsquo;s friend, Jeny Yee, was in the car with Seto and largely confirmed his version of events.</p>
<p>Thomas, a 10-year veteran of the force, testified he was concerned for officer safety during the arrest, in part because Seto&rsquo;s vehicle had accelerated so quickly away from the police cruiser parked at the stoplight. The officer said he did not check to see who owned the car before using the bullhorn to order Seto out of the car and did not know the driver was of Asian descent.</p>
<p>Thomas acknowledged he had a &#8220;heated&#8221; conversation with Seto but couldn&rsquo;t recall exactly what was said during the arrest because he took no notes.</p>
<p>He testified he placed his pinky finger between the cuffs and Seto&rsquo;s wrists to ensure they weren&rsquo;t too tight, and denied dragging the doctor by his cuffed hands to the car.</p>
<p>He told the court he seized the pager because he has known criminals who conceal weapons in all kinds of apparently harmless items, such as cellphones and belt buckles.</p>
<p>When Hatch directly asked him whether he believed he was dealing with an Asian drug dealer, Thomas flatly denied it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That didn&rsquo;t even cross my mind once,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The case returns to court today.<br>

<p>huh. That&rsquo;s odd. Although we all know that this perp is clearly lying in order strike it rich in the asian version of the ghetto lottery, I seem to remember how the Chinese are taught their whole life to hate the West - meaning Whites. As a White man, I am offended. I am just waiting for that compensation cheque&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is what happens when you make some more equal than others. For all we know the cop gave him the rough treatment because his wife was or girlfriend or something was with him in the car. Liberals are insane. We know that. And there are a lot of them out there.</p>

<p>It sounds like whatever &#8220;severe&#8221; treatment Dr. Seto received from Const. Thomas had more to with his wanton disregard for the law and his blatant disrespect for the good officer. What type of moron speeds away from an intersection when a police car is right behind them?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if any of you watches the cop shows on tv, but whenever some big mouth butthead gets handcuffed, he generally starts crying and whining &#8220;oww oww, that really hurts&#8221;!  Well, perhaps this idiot was wanting a confrontation with a policeman, since he was at the same light as the cop, and peeled off fast when the light turned.  I believe he knew it was a cop behind him when he started the whole thing; I mean we all look in our rearview mirrors when we are driving.  </p>
<p>I wonder what his payoff will be? </p>

		<p>This guy had better hope his dashboard camera was working. Or at least his pocket digital recorder.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that, Dr. Seto? You didn&rsquo;t know that cops carry those things?</p>

		<p>Speed limits have absolutely no correlation to traffic accidents or fatalities. People drive at the speed they feel comfortable at, with relatively few exceptions.</p>
<p>It is a makework policy for policemen which is effectively another source of revenue for cities/states/counties.</p>

		<p>To be fair, one of the biggest blows to the pro-white movement is all of the racism within it. Let us make sure to separate the anti-non-white movement from the pro-white movement. Was he treated as he was simply because he&rsquo;s a minority? Hard to say, but if so, I hope he receives compensation for the emotional distress this must have caused him. </p>

		<p>Seto&rsquo;s version of the story doesn&rsquo;t sound like the officer was unreasonable. It&rsquo;s about what one should expect for driving like a maniac.</p>

		<p>Impossible to say who is right here. In such situations, the officer must get benefit of doubt. But cops can be as pushy as arrogant motorists. Not sure this article demonstrates anything about Asian rights or Asian arrogance.</p>

		<p>Me,I&rsquo;m just waiting for some Black or dark-complexioned &#8220;genius&#8221; to come up with the theory that dark skin pigmentation was a nasty invention by early White people. So they could more easily be singled out for exploitation and abuse. Having the charge thrown at us, that being WHITE is racist in itself. That we are racists for the fact so many of us (intelligent types) stubbornly refuse to breed with non-Whites to get rid of Whiteness.</p>
<p>You can only laugh at the absurdity non-Whites keep coming up with. Recalling that History Channel series: &#8220;After People&#8221;, juxtaposing the idea that only Whites vanished instantly&hellip; how many decades would it take for the non-White countries to sink back into barbarism and chaos? I&rsquo;d give the Africans maybe a half-century. The Orientals would sink to feudalism in maybe a century to a century and a half. Then again, maybe I&rsquo;m being too generous, respective to Africans, at least. Left on their own, chaos might come a lot sooner. Look at any Black-ruled country if you need proof of their general incompetence.</p>

<p>50km over the speed limit is more than 30mph over the speed limit.  That&rsquo;s &#8220;Driving With Intent To Kill&#8221; in my state.  It&rsquo;s a felony.</p>

		<p>Yes, Fed Up, you are being generous.</p>
<p>As for the cop, I sure hope he had a working dash cam going, with sound recording.  This reminds me of that (white) &#8220;great-grandmother&#8221; about a month ago here in the states who pushed a (white) cop around and defied him to take her to jail until he tased her.  She lied through her teeth and slandered him until the dash cam video came out.  Oops.</p>
<p>Even 15 mph over the speed limit in a commercial vehicle in the U.S. is considered &#8220;reckless endangerment&#8221;.</p>
