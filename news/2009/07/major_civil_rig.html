			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lila Shapiro, Huffington Post, July 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MSNBC president Phil Griffin called the claim that President Obama is a foreigner, which has received significant media coverage over the last few days, &#8220;racist.&#8221; From the NY Times:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s racist,&#8221; said Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC. &#8220;It&rsquo;s racist. Just call it for what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Lou Dobbs &#8220;Birthers&#8221; saga continues.</p>
<p>This morning, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a major civil rights group, wrote a letter calling on CNN President Jon Klein to remove CNN host Lou Dobbs from the air. The request stems from a segment on Dobbs&rsquo; radio show this past Tuesday where Dobbs did his part to keep alive the conspiracy theory that President Obama is not an American citizen (AKA the &#8220;birther&#8221; theory). On air, he speculated: &#8220;I&rsquo;m starting to think we have a document issue. You suppose he&rsquo;s un .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no, I won&rsquo;t even use the word undocumented, it wouldn&rsquo;t be right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is the letter sent by SPLC president Richard Cohen to CNN&rsquo;s Klein:<blockquote>Dear Mr. Klein,</p>
<p>As an important and respected news organization, CNN has a special responsibility to ensure the accuracy of its reporting. We have written to you before about our concern that Lou Dobbs repeatedly fails to live up to this standard in his reporting on immigration. Now, Mr. Dobbs is again trading in falsehoods and racist conspiracy theories, questioning President Obama&rsquo;s American citizenship.</p>
<p>On the July 15 edition of &#8220;Lou Dobbs Tonight,&#8221; Mr. Dobbs questioned the official certificate provided by the president and the State of Hawaii and complained that President Obama has not made public the &#8220;original document.&#8221; On his radio program, Mr. Dobbs has repeatedly questioned the president&rsquo;s fitness for office, demanding he &#8220;show the documents&#8221; and, at one point, jokingly suggesting President Obama may be &#8220;undocumented.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth about the president&rsquo;s birth is not in dispute. It has been verified by Factcheck.org, among many other serious news organizations, and his official birth documents have been made public. {snip}</p>
<p>As he has in several other instances, Mr. Dobbs, in taking up the birthers&rsquo; claims, is adopting an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that originated on the radical racist right. As Gawker.com has reported, this particular conspiracy theory was first developed by an open anti-Semite and circulated by right-wing extremists who cannot accept the fact that a black man has been elected president of the United States. Among its adherents was neo-Nazi James von Brunn, the alleged murderer of a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., this June. Von Brunn had helped spread the birthers&rsquo; claims on the Internet and attacked the &#8220;dishonest &amp; conspiratorial Media&#8221; for not taking them up.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Mr. Dobbs has pushed racist conspiracy theories or defamatory falsehoods about immigrants. {snip} In addition, Mr. Dobbs has reported as fact the so-called Aztlan conspiracy, which claims that undocumented Mexican immigrants are part of a plot to &#8220;reconquer&#8221; the American Southwest. He has suggested there is something to a related conspiracy theory that claims the governments of Mexico, the United States and Canada are secretly planning to merge into the &#8220;North American Union.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Respectable news organizations should not employ reporters willing to peddle racist conspiracy theories and false propaganda. It&rsquo;s time for CNN to remove Mr. Dobbs from the airwaves.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
</blockquote></p>
<p>The SPLC isn&rsquo;t the first group to have demanded the removal of Dobbs. Yesterday, the progressive watchdog group Media Matters blasted out a press release to reporters charging that &#8220;CNN has a very serious Lou Dobbs problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it seemed as though the message was starting to sink in. TVNewser reported today that Jon Klein sent a memo to a group of Dobbs&rsquo; staffers explaining in no uncertain terms that the whole &#8220;birthers&#8221; story is &#8220;dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, in an interview with Greg Sargent this afternoon, Klein backtracked and brushed off the criticism. &#8220;Look, Lou&rsquo;s his own show, and CNN in general has repeatedly and thoroughly reported on the facts behind this situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also took a dig at his critics, suggesting that they were politically motivated.<br>
<blockquote>Asked if CNN is concerned that Dobbs&rsquo; repeated granting of airtime to theories the network has conclusively debunked amounts to overkill and could harm CNN&rsquo;s credibility, Klein brushed off the possibility. &#8220;We respect our viewers enough to present them the facts and let them make up their own minds,&#8221; he said, adding that what Dobbs does is &#8220;his editorial decision to make.&#8221;</blockquote><br>

		<p>&#8220;Asked if CNN is concerned that Dobbs&rsquo; repeated granting of airtime to theories (BHO not US citizen by birth) the network has conclusively debunked&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Debunked? Where? When? How?</p>
<p>I keep hearing on the news – what little Main Stream Media I catch – about the wild nut jobs who keep implying that Barack is really not a US citizen (crazy nuts that we are).<br>
What I can&rsquo;t understand is why the MSM call us names yet they and their minions refuse to produce a valid birth certificate (not the &ldquo;Record of Live Birth&rdquo; that they waved right before the grand illusion of Change in November). I&rsquo;d like to see a valid, honest to gosh Birth Certificate cross referenced with a liber/ folio number and location of the hall of records in the US State and City where he was born. It would put all of us nuts in our place and shut us up for good. If you all can&rsquo;t, I suppose you can just go right ahead and keep calling us crazy&hellip;I just think producing the document would be easier. If it exists.     <br>

		<p>The SPLC is attempting to create a Stalinst police state where thoughts will be criminalized. Lou Dobbs must go after the dirtbag Dees. Expose Dees on his TV show. There is no other way to deal with Dees. Take the gloves off. Vdare.com should go after Dees also.</p>
<p>It does look like the issue of Barack Obama&rsquo;s legal status is picking up some steam.</p>
<p>Barack Obama is an anti-white Kenyan -possibly illegal alien-also- bigot.</p>
<p>White Women who marry black males are race traitors. They should be disowned by thier parents. If White parents disowned their White Daughters who marry blacks, miscegenation would have ended a long time ago.</p>
<p>Their should be complete intolerance of miscegenation.</p>

		<p>lol I&rsquo;m surprised this is the first time this has come up (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong), criticizing Obama specifically is considered racist. When you think about it, however, criticizing any Democrat viewpoint is considered racist. Heck, saying you don&rsquo;t want affirmative action (discrimination against Whites), is practically white-supremacist. </p>

		<p>Hate to see Lou Dobbs ride this issue.  It is a dead horse.  Well investigated by McCains lawyers when he was running for President and found to be without any merit whatsoever.  Dobbs is just hurting himself and the legitimate causes he espouses by pursuing this issue. Not only did McCain&rsquo;s lawyers see a copy of his birth certificate from Hawaii but talked to the appropriate  official who verified he had seen  the original.  Even more significantly they found the announcement of his birth in a local paper which they conceded would have been difficult to arrange 47 years in advance.  This kind of stuff is not helpful to either our positions  or credibility.</p>

<p>Lou Dobbs is the best thing CNN has going for it.  Klein seems to be standing behind Dobbs but has also said the &#8220;birth&#8221; issue is a dead issue. We are in trouble if groups like the Southern Popverty Law Center and MEChA can dictate what people, like Lou Dobbs, can say on a TV.</p>
<p>Many Americans do not think the &#8220;birth&#8221; issue has been settled and MOST Americans do  not believe in Open Borders, Amnesty, and MEChA&rsquo;s Reconquista.  </p>
<p>Maybe Lou would be better off on Fox!<br>

		<p>So it seems it is now &#8220;racist&#8221; to caste doubt on Barry&rsquo;s legitimacy to be president.  Why is this racist?  You might wonder.  Well, you see, there was this crazy neo-nazi guy who believed the same accusation.</p>
<p>Using the above logic, I feel it&rsquo;s my duty to inform leftists the world over that vegetarianism is racist.  Why?  Because Hitler was a vegetarian.</p>
<p>&#8220;No no no!&#8221; say the leftists.  &#8220;You see, the &#8216;racist right wing&#8221; ORIGINATED that idea&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Very well.  Henry Ford ORIGINATED the mass production of automobiles - and he was an anti-Semite (or so they say).  So, all you leftists, you&rsquo;d better get used to using your bicycles from now on.</p>
<p>In other words, this is just your typical &#8220;guilt by association&#8221; ad hominem attack.</p>

		<p>The SPLC is itself a racist organization, standing against the legitimate interests of white people. Morris Deas, the head of the organization, is a racial polarizer in the tradition of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. He has become wealthy through suggestion and innuendo, and as in this case, by trying to supress speech with which he does not agree.Incidentally, as a person of the right, my objection to B.Obama is not his race, but rather his Marxist philosophy and radical associations. In the name of commom sense, B.H.O. is a man who counted as a friend William Ayers, an America hating radical terrorist.Did I mention the good reverend Wright? Lord help us all. What a bunch of miscreants have taken over all of our institutions in these United States.  </p>

		<p>The diverse white American peoples need to start using labels back when accused of racism, and the best one is to accuse the accuser of being a supremacist.</p>
<p>The charge of supremacy can be easily located in the mental constructs of the original accuser which allows him or her to claim a supreme power to name, describe, label, and read the mind of the victim of the racism label.</p>
<p>Plus it changes the subject.</p>

		<p>The SPLC is calling Lou Dobbs racist because he questioned the authenticity of a birth certificate? I think that&rsquo;s a little extreme. Especially when some polls have shown that over 50% of Americans are skeptical, as well.</p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs is not a racist.</p>
<p>First of all, Lou Dobbs has never based his stance against illegal immigration on racial terms. Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t recall Lou Dobbs ever argueing against legal immigration.</p>
<p>I know that Lou Dobbs is married to a Hispanic woman. I cannot conceive of an interracially married person being racist.</p>
<p>I remember listening to the Lou Dobbs radio program one day. The subject at hand was on the white and black racial disparity. One of the callers said that the white and black racial disparity was due to differences in intellectual capabilities, and Lou Dobbs became hostile and basically insulted the caller. Not that I agree with Lou Dobbs on that, but it&rsquo;s wrong to call him racist after he said what he said to that caller.</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, which is really just a witch-hunting organization that targets people that don&rsquo;t agree with their distorted, left-wing world view, uses the pathetic, fallacious straw-man arguement against Lou Dobbs by associating the notion that Obama may not be a US citizen, which is a legitimate concern as Obama has failed to publicly produce his original birth certificate, with a neo-Nazi murderer. When people resort to using deceptive arguements, it&rsquo;s a sign that they can&rsquo;t win the arguement by legitimate means.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with everything that Lou Dobbs says, but I still admire him very much. I think that he is bold for taking a stand against illegal immigration and other issues that a lot of the media won&rsquo;t talk about. Depite the SPLC and other malignant left-wing groups who deceptively title themselves &#8220;civil rights organizations&#8221; defaming Lou Dobbs and trying to oust him, I hope that his show will continue to stay on air for many, many years.</p>

		<p>Dobbs is a moron for covering this &#8220;birther&#8221; nonsense. </p>
<p>I mean, who cares if Obama is citizen or not? </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s black and he doesn&rsquo;t recognize the interests of white people. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that enough!?! </p>

		<p>The diversity mob hates Dobbs because of his relentlessness to expose the failure of the US government over many years to enforce immigration laws. Dobbs is also hated by Big Business because of his exposure of &#8220;free trade&#8221; as a fraud to wipe the US clean of manufacturing jobs for US Citizens.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you think of the birthing matter and Obama, it is a tiny fraction of what Dobbs has done to offend those who want open borders and who want to destroy American culture and traditions.</p>

		<p>Let us not cave in to censorship. Either Mr. Dobbs claims are valid or he is jepordizing his reputation and name. I believe the SPLC has the right to exist as well. We are a nation of freedom, As MR. Klein said,  &#8220;let the people decide&#8221;. (WE The People) is better than  (We the SPLC). How do we know the Southern poverty law center is not involved in its own conspiracy?</p>

<p>how is Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate a dead issue? the birth certificate has NEVER been made public, nor have any of Obama&rsquo;s other records (medical, academic, etc.). the lies from Obama&rsquo;s camp surrounding the issue are becoming more and more blatant. take for example factcheck.org. </p>
<p>according to this link: [url]http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/born_in_the_usa.html[/url], around the period of August21 - November 1, 2008 &#8220;FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate. We conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship. Claims that the document lacks a raised seal or a signature are false. We have posted high-resolution photographs of the document as &#8220;supporting documents&#8221; to this article.&#8221; </p>
<p>i find this incredibly interesting &hellip; especially considering the State of Hawaii now claims that Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate was destroyed 8 years ago, in 2001. or am i to believe that they knew Obama was going to be The Great Leader all those years ago and investigated then? *laughs*</p>
<p>now, it&rsquo;s been discovered that Obama has used at least 39 different Social Security Numbers. </p>
<p>yep, seems like a dead horse to me. nothing to see here at all. please, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. these are NOT the droids you are looking for. </p>

		<p>The SPLC is a major civil rights group?  Ha ha ha ha!  They are a major shakedown group.</p>
<p>Obama could have resolved the &#8220;natural born citizen&#8221; thing right from the start by having the hospital release the long form birth certificate.  He did not.  There are people in Kenya who claim to have witnessed Obama&rsquo;s birth there.  So <i>somebody</i> is lying.  I myself take no position on whether Obama meets the strict requirement of being a natural born citizen.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter, since the only one in Congress who will even bother to uphold the Constitution is Ron Paul.  For example, under our Constitution Hillary Clinton can not be Secretary of State.  The Constitution forbids a senator or representative from taking a position in federal government if there was an increase in salary for that position while that politician was in office.  (This is to prevent politicians from voting for lucrative government jobs that they then jump into after leaving office.)  The Secretary of State got a raise while Hillary was a senator.  But no one follows the Constitution any more.  Among our congressmen, only Ron Paul even knows what&rsquo;s in it.<br>

<p>I think CNN and Fox need to trade. Move Lou Dobbs to Fox News and let CNN have Geraldo Rivera.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The diverse white American peoples need to start using labels back when accused of racisism&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The label &#8216;racist&rsquo; is designed to put a targeted White instantly into a weak, defensive position and force him to spend inordinate amounts of time defending himself as a &#8216;non-racist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You cannot win this from this groveling position and will appear weak and foolish as you are forced to kow-tow to black supremacists who &#8216;cannot be accused of racism&rsquo; against Whites no matter how much anti-White venom they spew.</p>
<p>Remember how foolish Trent Lott appeared as he tried in vain to &#8216;prove&rsquo; he was not racist by bowing and scraping to black power-brokers?   I didn&rsquo;t help him.</p>
<p>The hostile elites well know this and spew the term &#8216;racist&rsquo; at will at White voices they wish to silence  &mdash;  I am listening to Rush as I&rsquo;m writing this and HE is futility defending himself against charges of racism directed at him.   They have powerful, powerful allies in the media and anti-White organizations such as the $PLC.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see:  Glenn Beck  &mdash;  Racist!  Rush Limbagh  &mdash;  Racist!  Lou Dobbs  &mdash;  Racist!</p>
<p>It is a ploy to silence them, along with a demand to re-instate the &#8216;Fairness Doctrine&rsquo; which will silence any right-leaning voices.  Next they&rsquo;ll take on the Internet.</p>

		<p>I could put up a web site on what McCain&rsquo;s lawyers found but some would claim any particular site  was biased, so those really interested can google &#8220;McCain&rsquo;s lawyers Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate&#8221; and evaluate the many different sources themselves. As I noted above McCain&rsquo;s lawyers conceded  it is impossible to plant a birth notice in the local paper 47 years in advance.   The statements here by some in direct contravention of the facts makes me start to wonder if I really am part of a  band of like brothers, or am instead rubbing elbows with the same kind of folks who refuse to accept the indisputable fact that blacks on average perform significantly below whites on IQ tests. I will grant everyone the right to their own opinion but will not grant that opinion is well informed.</p>

<p>you can see the live press conference where Dr. Orly Taitz, the lawyer for Major Cook (the latest Army officer to challenge Obama&rsquo;s eligibility), makes this statement. she is quite clear. here is the link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdBVN7azPs8" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdBVN7azPs8</a></p>
<p>as for the claim regarding the destruction of the original birth certificate hard copy, in addition to Lou Dobbs&rsquo; assertion, the president of CNN Jon Klein also validated that CNN researchers had verified this. you can see that claim here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ncrj5f" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/ncrj5f</a></p>
<p>but it gets even better! </p>
<p>now, the state of Hawaii is refuting those claims! as reported by WorldNetDaily here: <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=105233" rel="nofollow">http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId;=105233</a></p>

		<p>Renae, I know you didn&rsquo;t ask me but my solution has always been to fight fire with fire. I call them racists and anti-white. They almost never expect this and it usually stumps them. There is no reason to bother seeking high ground with these people on the far left. They are so utterly brainwashed that they are reacting with their programmed mind. </p>
<p>The essence of propganda, is to repeat things over and over and over. They know this, thus the continual charge of racism,which you must return. A hispanic &#8220;civil rights&#8221; leader in Los Angeles, once said that,&#8221;we charge our opponents with being racist, not because we believe they are racist, but because charging them as being racist  &mdash;  WORKS.&#8221;  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why you put any faith in McCain&rsquo;s judgement.  Didn&rsquo;t he also choose not to make an issue of Reverend Wright, or the many racist statments in Barack&rsquo;s own biography?  McCain&rsquo;s campaign was inept from beginning to end.</p>
<p>There are 2 issues at hand:</p>
<p>First, instead of simply authorizing release of his original Hawaiian birth certificate, why has Obama spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to stonewall?  Why has he sealed his college application records?  Maybe he was indeed born in the US, but don&rsquo;t you wonder what&rsquo;s on those records he doesn&rsquo;t want us to see?</p>
<p>One does not need to be a conspiracy nut, as you imply, to express curiousity as to what is going on.</p>
<p>Second, as Post #23 concisely put it, it&rsquo;s not about the appropriateness of the question, it&rsquo;s about the right to ask it.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always suspected he wants to hide his low test scores  &mdash;  and that he was admitted to the universities he attended via AA, not because &#8216;he&rsquo;s brilliant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If his abilities and brilliance were as high as the msm led us to believe, his test scores would have been trumpeted by the msm from every mountain top in the US 24/7 during the election.  Otherwise, why weren&rsquo;t they released?</p>
<p>After all:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Bush&rsquo;s 1206 SAT score on the college entrance exam and his C average at Yale have been public knowledge since the last election&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kerry tried to hide his scores as well but&hellip;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Navy&rsquo;s OQT that Kerry took in 1966 was a 90-minute pencil and paper test consisting of 35 verbal analogy questions, 30 mechanical comprehension questions, and 50 arithmetic reasoning questions.</p>
<p>Kerry got 58 out of 115 questions right, or 50.4 percent&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Brokaw asked Senator John Kerry about his low score and</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; after the cameras were turned off, the candidate rationalized to Brokaw: &#8216;I must have been drinking the night before I took that military aptitude test.&rsquo;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/3vk2q </p>
<p>What does obama not want us to see on his college apps?  I have a feeling the msm well know what his college application, test scores and grades look like but will sit on the story rather than burst the bubble of obama&rsquo;s Messiah image.</p>
<p>As always, the msm give obama a pass.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I know that Lou Dobbs is married to a Hispanic woman. I cannot conceive of an interracially married person being racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anon,<br>
Hispanic is a language designation; not a racial one.  I don&rsquo;t know who Lou&rsquo;s wife is but that fact that she is Hispanic doesn&rsquo;t necessarily define her as non- white.<br>
Hispanic is anyone who comes from a country whose official language is Spanish.</p>
<p>Latino,a is anyone whose ancestoral language evolved from Latin.  Therefore Spaniards,  Hispanics, Italians, French, Portuguese and even Roumanians are Latin(o)s. Strictly speaking Sonya Sotomayor should she be confirmed, will be the first Hispanic on the Supreme Court but not the first Latino,a. She is preceded by Justices Scalia and Alitto. The famous Rudolph Valentino of early films whose real surname was Guglielmi was referred to as a &#8220;Latin lover&#8221;</p>
<p>We have mistakenly used both the above mentioned terms as designating a race. It can be complicated. A former colleague of mine who is a Spanish teacher  was ethnically Chinese but was born and raised in Cuba. I suppose she could be considered Hispanic but not Latina. When she referred to herself as Cuban,many people got that &#8220;Yea right!&#8221; expression on their faces. <br>
THe left has co-opted several terms and the sheeple have gone along with them. Another example is &#8220;homophobe&#8221;. Someone who hates and abhors homosexuals. The suffix comes from Greek and means &#8220;fear of&#8221; and homo is LAtin for man. Therefore a homophobia would mean fear of men. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more logical to say Homosexualphobe?<br>
Anyway, Lou Dobbs should be able to express his opinion as long as there had still be no verification of BHO&rsquo;s true birthplace.<br>
