<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police say former Washington Mayor Marion Barry has been arrested and charged with stalking a woman.</p>
<p>The United States Park Police said Barry, a current D.C. Council member, was arrested Saturday in Washington after a woman flagged down an officer and complained Barry was stalking her. Barry was charged with misdemeanor stalking and released.</p>
<p>Barry&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Natalie Williams, said Sunday that the accusation was &#8220;baseless.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says Barry plans to fight the charge and said the accuser is a 40-year-old woman Barry had helped financially.</p>
<p>Barry served four terms as mayor. In his third, he was videotaped in 1990 in a hotel room smoking crack cocaine in an FBI sting. He served six months in prison and in 1994 regained the mayor&rsquo;s office.<br>

		<p>He&rsquo;s 73, she&rsquo;s 40.  She&rsquo;s old enough to be his grandchild, especially in D.C. terms.  What does she see in him?  I think the article answers my question:  Money.  He was her sugar daddy, and she was his occasional &#8220;action,&#8221; to put it diplomatically.  In other words, an extended trick.</p>

<p>Well, according to him all laws are racist, so he was arrested because of racism, not stalking.</p>
<p>&#8220;The laws in this city are clearly racist. All laws are racist. Even the law of gravity is racist.&#8221;  Marion Barry, Ex. Mayor of Wash., D.C.&#8221;<br>

		<p>My first reaction to any story on &#8220;stalking&#8221; is suspicion. Somehow the world got along fine for eons with no laws on this so-called crime; it was unheard-of until 1990. Nobody seems to know what precisely it consists of. Some women use the new laws unscrupulously, for revenge or humiliation. Even in the case of someone like Barry, caution is in order.</p>

		<p>When a black man &#8220;helps a woman financially&#8221; that means he&rsquo;s paying for sex. Or at least trying to.</p>

		<p>to MR./MS Dibby: no Marion won&rsquo;t ever grow up. Nor did Michael Jackson,nor do most(not all) black males. T</p>
<p>his guy was against segregation(how courageous in a majority black city) in the 60&rsquo;s, ran for office promising everything while LBJ and Nixon paid for it all with federal funds, and when the gravy train ended in the 80&rsquo;s and major real estate and banking money entered the city and bought off the black politicians, Barry was toast. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been a minor figure for 25 yrs and the poor blacks of southeast DC think he is their savior. No investor of size puts a penny into that godforsaken, drug-ridden quadrant of the city represented by this man child. </p>
<p>The Washington Post thinks he&rsquo;s cute and injects him back into the national reporting cycle when he&rsquo;s busted for his petty crime, usually not paying for something or not obeying a court order. </p>
<p>Right now he is defying IRS, something most of us wouldn&rsquo;t have the guts to do. While I despise IRS and hope that it doesn&rsquo;t jail anyone or seize anyone&rsquo;s property, I do wonder how Marion is able to stick his thumb in their eye when you or I would already be in jail for nonpayment of taxes. Favoritism?</p>

		<p>But, don&rsquo;t judge him, he has done so much for &#8220;his people.&#8221;  The value system of blacks, anyone giving handouts is never held accountable unless, it&rsquo;s drugs or sex.  Then they kill for either or both.</p>
<p>Steve McNair, forget all he ever did as a God Gifted athlete, he left a wife and four children fatherless and husbandless.  Judge him hard and fast, he spit in the face of all that is decent, he violated basic societal rules in every society except that of the great american black.</p>

<p>Well at the age of 70+ I think the question is moot. In fact most black men are very immature and irresponsible and remain so their entire lives. Look at the black rates of STD&rsquo;s and illegitimacy for example.</p>

		<p><b>I. can&rsquo;t. WAIT. for this guy to fall and fall big.</b>  I&rsquo;m expecting this crack-smoking self-righteous opportunist to actually step over the line and cause grievous bodily harm to someone   &mdash;   he might even do an O.J. on some woman.  </p>
<p>Think of it   &mdash;   he has the drug habit (and crack doesn&rsquo;t mellow you out, does it?), and now he&rsquo;s been accused of stalking. Someone&rsquo;s going to end up dead and the signs will point to the Mayor. </p>
