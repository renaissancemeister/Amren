<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The father of a model, allegedly stabbed to death by her boyfriend, found her lying in the foetal position in a pool of blood, a court has heard.</p>
<p>Andrew Barnes discovered his daughter, Amy Leigh, 19, with her &#8220;eyes half open&#8221; and &#8220;struggling to breathe&#8221; at her grandmother&rsquo;s house in Bolton.</p>
<p>She had been slashed and stabbed nine times, Manchester Crown Court heard.</p>
<p>Ricardo Morrison, 21, from Birmingham, denies murder. His mother, Pc&nbsp;[sic]&nbsp;Melda Wilks, denies assisting an offender.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;I&rsquo;ll kill him&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Mr Barnes told jurors he entered the terraced house in Moss Street just before midnight on 8 November, 2008, to find his daughter on the floor at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had cuts to her face and she was lying in the foetal position,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He dialled 999 and spoke to the same operator that his daughter had spoken to just minutes before.</p>
<p>The court heard she had called the emergency services pleading with them to help her, saying, &#8220;He&rsquo;s stabbed me to death .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my boyfriend&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sgt Andrew Smith was the first officer on the scene.</p>
<p>He told the court that Mr Barnes had heard a loud bang at the back of the property which sounded like a door being shut.</p>
<p>Sgt Smith said: &#8220;Mr Barnes said, &#8216;It&rsquo;s him, it will be him, he might still be in the house&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr Barnes ran outside. I ran after him and I heard him shout, &#8216;Where is he? He&rsquo;s here, I&rsquo;ll kill him&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked who was he talking about. He said Ricardo Morrison.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;I love him&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Shortly before she was killed Ms Barnes had spoken to her mother, Karyn Killiner, who also gave evidence, telling the court she had had concerns about her daughter&rsquo;s relationship with Mr Morrison.</p>
<p>She told the court that her daughter pleaded with her to come and get her from her grandmother&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said to me, &#8216;Will you come now?&rsquo; and started to cry. I said, &#8216;Yes darling&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said she wanted to come home and that he had said some awful things to her. She had told him that he&rsquo;s not going to control her any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The couple had been together for a year, and in August 2008, the model&rsquo;s grandmother Catherine Barnes allowed them to stay with her as a &#8220;temporary arrangement&#8221;.</p>
<p>Under cross examination from Johannah Cutts QC, defending Mr Morrison, Mrs Barnes agreed her granddaughter had lots of friends and liked socialising, but the defendant wanted her to spend time with him.</p>
<p>A month after they moved in Ms Barnes asked him to leave her grandmother&rsquo;s house after he told her he was helping a friend move from Birmingham to Manchester  &mdash;  but in fact he had gone out alone to a club.</p>
<p>But she told her grandmother: &#8220;I love him, I can&rsquo;t finish with him, I can&rsquo;t keep him away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trial continues.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/8148544.stm">Dying Model Plea &lsquo;He Stabbed Me&rsquo;</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>BBC News, July 13, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A young model dialled 999 as she lay dying and pleaded for help saying her boyfriend had &#8220;stabbed her to death&#8221;, a court has heard.</p>
<p>Amy Leigh Barnes&rsquo; father found her in a pool of blood at her grandmother&rsquo;s house in Bolton, Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old&rsquo;s boyfriend, Ricardo Morrison, denied murdering her when he appeared at Manchester Crown Court.</p>
<p>His police officer mother, Pc [sic] Melda Wilks, from the West Midlands, was also in court and denies assisting her son.</p>
<p>The court heard that Ms Barnes, a part-time model and actress, had been killed with a kitchen knife in November last year.</p>
<p>Stuart Driver, prosecuting, recounted her desperate plea to the operator at the end of her 999 call.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Penetrated liver&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m dying. He&rsquo;s stabbed me to death. I&rsquo;m dying. Please help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The operator asked who had stabbed her and she said, &#8220;My boyfriend&#8221;, the court heard.</p>
<p>He said Ms Barnes had been slashed across the face and she had five wounds to her chest and four to her back, several of which had penetrated her liver.</p>
<p>At this point the defendant turned his back and ran towards the cells.</p>
<p>Following Mr Morrison&rsquo;s return to the dock, Mr Driver told the court that Ms Barnes had tried to end the relationship that day and he had attacked her before leaving, locking her in the house.</p>
<p>Later, she rang her mother in tears, and it was agreed her father would come to pick her up.</p>
<p>Two minutes after that call ended she dialled 999 to say she had been &#8220;stabbed to death&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her father turned up, opened the front door and found his daughter at the bottom of the stairs, a pool of blood beneath her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can imagine his reaction, his panic,&#8221; Mr Driver said.</p>
<p><b>Blood-stained knife</b></p>
<p>Ms Barnes was taken to the Royal Bolton Infirmary where she died three hours later.</p>
<p>The court heard that a neighbour had spotted a man, fitting Mr Morrison&rsquo;s description, on wasteland shortly after she had been attacked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The witness said the man bent down and put his hand into a puddle and appeared to be rinsing his hands,&#8221; Mr Driver said.</p>
<p>A blood-stained knife, which had DNA belonging to the young model, was found stuck in an abandoned car seat on the wasteland.</p>
<p>The defendant caught a coach to Birmingham where his mother, Pc Wilks, who lives in Rubery, picked him up, it is alleged.</p>
<p>Mr Driver told the jury that she washed his jacket &#8220;for a criminal purpose to remove any forensic scientific evidence&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ms Barnes&rsquo;s mother, Karyn, phoned Pc Wilks from the hospital soon after the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;She told her that Amy had been stabbed and accused her son, Ricardo Morrison, of doing it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>Recovery position</b></p>
<p>Pc Wilks then sent a text to Ms Barnes&rsquo; mother: &#8220;I know what my son has done is unforgivable. No need to be rude. Now I understand more about your family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not call me again. My son will be dealt with by law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morrison said in his defence statement that he was not at the house when the attack took place.</p>
<p>He said he returned to the house in Bolton, discovered she had been stabbed and put her in the recovery position before he left the scene.</p>
<p>Mr Driver disputed this, saying it would have meant that another person must have stabbed Amy in the space of two minutes  &mdash;  the gap in which Ms Barnes finished on the phone to her mother and when she dialled 999.</p>
<p>The trial continues.<br/>

		<p>You would think White women would wake up by now, but they aren&rsquo;t. You see more and more in these kinds of relationships every day. Too bad their parents didn&rsquo;t instill in them pride and self preservation in their own race and to ignore all the propaganda thrown at them daily. She may have still been alive if she dated only White men.</p>

		<p>UK looks more and more like an African country, the second fastest degenerating country after France.<br/>
We have to leave EU and strengthen our borders before it is too late. The British deserve it because they love Africans and East Indians.<br/>
Soon UK and France will be history.<br/>
No simpathy for race mixers, in fact it is better for her to die before she produces mongrels.<br/>

		<p>The question remains as always, when will we awaken from our stupor?  I must admit to being ignorant as I grew up.  In a white neighborhood, as the civil rights movement was igniting.  I was indeed caught up in the &#8220;Noble Savage&#8221; idea.  I maintained that mindset for years, but gradually came to see the light as I joined the air force, and got to experience the joys of the savage in the field one might say.  As my daughters approached dating age, I was fully armed with the facts.  I located in a virtually white suburban area, ensured my daughters never got involved with blacks, and am happy to say my oldest is now married to a white male of the same mindset I am.  The lesson is, as the song goes, Teach Your Children Well&hellip;</p>

		<p>A few years ago, I was talking with two white women.  One of them was telling a story about a girl she knew in college; a white female who was dating a black male.  Her parents threatened to cut her off &#8220;just because her boyfriend was black.&#8221;  She relented, and broke off the relationship.  The story was intended to be sympathetic toward the interacial relationship, I was thinking, that girl&rsquo;s parents must have really cared about her.</p>

		<p>Whites are too weak to teach their daughters about sex, much less the evil of miscegenation.  They just turn their children over the the marxist state&rsquo;s &#8220;free&#8221; education system, which glorifies miscegenation, homosexuality, promiscuity, and collectivism.  We have reaped what we have sown.  </p>
<p>Every White girl should be taught, even before the biological facts of life, that they are never to have a relationship with a black man.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe such a lovely young woman couldn&rsquo;t find a suitable companion of her own race. The black-on-white rape statistics alone should deter all white women from risking interracial romances. Besides, if they have black children it means an end to their family heritage: it would be better for them to die childless, since multiculturalism is a temporary and failing social experiment. After our brief tragic age of multiculturalism where will all the mixed children go? Their light skin will doom them in a black society to exploitation and violence.</p>

No Sympathy for Her. No Mercy for Him.<br/>

It&rsquo;s by Michael O&rsquo;Meara over at the TOQ Online.<br/>
It&rsquo;s his review of Orlov&rsquo;s book. <br/>
Personally, I consider it a must read.</p>

		<p>I feel no sympathy for this woman.</p>
<p>She is a race traitor.</p>
<p>Why is it that blacks insist on bedding white women?</p>
<p>Why is it that white women want to be bedded by blacks?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the OJ Simpson case a good enough lesson for these women.</p>
<p>Then of course there is the risk of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV.</p>
<p>These foolish women must realize that if they have children from the blacks they will be alone with the mixed race children and will not be wanted by any white male and will be abandoned by their black sperm donor.</p>
<p>This is not the first or the last.  There will be more and more of this type of crime so long as white women allow themselves to become involved with black men.</p>
<p>And where are the white men?  Why do not white men stand up for their white women?</p>

		<p>   I can hear white liberals saying &#8220;don&rsquo;t white&rsquo;s murder their girlfriend&rsquo;s at times?&#8221; Of course, they would rather ignore the troubling crime statistics in The Color of Crime (http://www.colorofcrime.com/colorofcrime2005.html). What is interesting is that the accused murderer&rsquo;s mother is a police officer, &#8220;who is accused of assisting her son by helping to destroy evidence by washing his blood-stained clothes.&#8221; This makes the case different than the usual O.J. type case. </p>

Too many women fall in love, not with the man, but in her own ability to reshape the man into her idealized man.</p>
<p>Too many women don&rsquo;t see the man as he is but as she believes she can mold him to become.</p>
<p>This is a fatal flaw for many white women who may see a black mans&rsquo; thuggish nature but she believes deep down, with enough love, he can be transformed into a loving, warm, caring life-partner. </p>
<p>Some women fall in love with the potential they see in changing a man.<br/>

		<p>White parents are faced with the problem that if they forbid their daughters to &#8220;date&#8221; blacks it may be a spur to those daughters to do just that as an act of rebellion and/or self-assertion. Easy to criticize the parents but often they are in an impossible position.</p>

		<p>This is the same old story. White girl meets black boy. Black boy kills white girl. The culture continues to spew out more propaganda that inter-racial dating is &#8220;cool.&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;And where are the white men?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>This day and age the youngsters can connect online through Myspace etc.<br/>
Without any parents or white men having much opportunity to get involved.</p>
<p>When that story about the London based actress/ model who had sulphuric acid thrown in her face, after breaking up with her stalker, rapist black boyfriend broke here a few weeks ago. </p>
<p>I did a couple of Google searches to get some further background  information and I found myself in some &#8216;twenty somethings&rsquo;, London based, partyboy&rsquo;s Myspace account.<br/>
And I found pages and pages with literally hundreds of carefully chosen friends where most of the females were beautiful, buxom, often blonde etc. And the males were &#8216;club cool&rsquo;, hip hoppers, D J&rsquo;s and of course mostly non-white.<br/>
It felt like some sort of hedonistic smorgasbord where everyone is politically correct, hip hop cool whilst trying to look as sexually appealing and available as possible.<br/>
 <br/>
And it was obvious to me the only way white male could do well in this world, would be to absorb as much of this hip hop culture as possible.<br/>
It&rsquo;s safe to say if you advertised yourself by saying something like &#8220;hi, I&rsquo;m a white male with conservative views, who believes in traditional family values, hard work, honesty, respecting the elderly and contributing positively to my community&#8221;, that none of these &#8216;cool&rsquo; wanna be models or D J&rsquo;s would be breaking their necks to add you as their Myspace friend. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just reporting what I saw.<br/>

<p>The SOLUTION is to educate your daughter(s) at an early age to be wary and disdainful of blacks. To make them understand that going out with a black is not &#8220;cool&#8221; and all this diversity nonsense is a load of horse manure. In my opinion the parents are partly to blame for this. </p>

		<p>Anon. #22: What a bad joke. White women who would date, or even marry non-Whites, do not want White men &#8220;Standing up for them&#8221;. </p>
<p>It is ridiculous, but those types of White women want to make their own bad decisions by themselves. To say anything, even though your blood is boiling over the situation, is to make you the automatic bad guy, since she will scream, and cry, that it is her life. Well, we saw how this life ended, didn&rsquo;t we? </p>
<p>I would personally have nothing to do with any White woman that would have any non-White &#8220;Friends&#8221; let alone, boy friends. No way. If you are that stupid, you are beyond help, and I am not a Therapist. </p>
<p>Then,if you were to say something that would be &#8220;Offensive&#8221; to, or about, the Brute dating the White woman, it could, and would, end up in a Brawl, either at a Bar, or Dance Club, or the beach. </p>
<p>And you know who would be in the &#8220;Wrong&#8221; for &#8220;Starting the fight&#8221; don&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;s right. The White guy. That is,if the White guy doesn&rsquo;t get shot, or stabbed, for his trouble, or if a mob of Blacks don&rsquo;t jump in, because we also know that even fewer Whites would get involved, to help their own people. That&rsquo;s just the way it is. It&rsquo;s pathetic, but it&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>I was shopping last week, and I saw five Mixed Race Couples, mostly Black and White, but there also was a Middle aged White guy, maybe between his late 40s and mid 50s, and a younger Asian woman, in her 30s. </p>
<p>It happens so often today, that no one, except me, seems to notice it at all. That&rsquo;s another thing that totally disgusts me with this damned Society. I just buy what I need, and get out of there, back to my sanctuary, away from all the trash. </p>

		<p>Several posters have said that white girls should be instructed or ordered by their parents never to fraternize with black boys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to say this, but much more difficult in practice.   If it is drilled into the child at a very young age then, when she goes to school, she is likely to blurt out to her (white) friends &ldquo;my daddy told me I must never have a black boyfriend..!&rdquo; </p>
<p>After this any or all of 3 things can happen….</p>
<p>1) Her &ldquo;friends&rdquo; – whose own parents probably haven&rsquo;t issued the same warning – will denounce her as a &ldquo;horrid little racist&rdquo; and if the blacks learn of her attitude she will either get savagely mocked or beaten-up.</p>
<p>2) If the school authorities find out then she is going to be disciplined or sent to special &ldquo;diversity training&rdquo;</p>
<p>3) The father/parents are also going to be in trouble for teaching their children &ldquo;racism&rdquo;. </p>
<p>On the other hand if the parents wait until the child is more mature before warning her about blacks, then it is too late because by then the Marxist &ldquo;diversity-training&rdquo; will have claimed her and she will probably denounce her parents as &ldquo;racists&rdquo; and deliberately consort with blacks in order to display her commitment to fashionable &ldquo;anti-racism&rdquo; and to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; her parents wrong&hellip;!</p>
<p>Without almost total segregation whites just have no hope.     <br/>

		<p>To all of you condemning this young woman for being with him, I want to say this;  It is not she who ought to be blamed, but her government and schools for enforcing policies that bring such people to them and then teach the children to abandon the sense they were born with that dictate distance when dealing with those racially and culturally different.  This girl was programed for her demise.</p>
<p>The British government has made it a crime for this father to tell his daughter to avoid dating Blacks and non-Whites.  Our respective governments have the responsibiliy - a primary one - to keep us safe.  Importing our tormentors under the guise of some sort of necessary immigration is systematic genocide - and government sponsored.  Be angry, but direct your anger at the truly guilty parties.  </p>
