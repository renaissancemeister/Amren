<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE55T7TU20090701">Probe Fingers 1,800 American Apparel Workers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexandria Sage, Reuters, July 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A U.S. federal probe has found that about a third of American Apparel&rsquo;s factory workers in the Los Angeles area had supplied suspect or invalid records and were not authorized to work in the United States.</p>
<p>The findings, from a January 2008 federal investigation, may deal a blow to the corporation&rsquo;s image as a proponent of immigration reform.</p>
<p>But the company said on Tuesday the potential loss of those 1,800 workers would have no significant impact on its results.</p>
<p>The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency found that some 1,600 current employees at American Apparel&rsquo;s Los Angeles factories appeared to have gained employment due to &#8220;suspect and not valid&#8221; eligibility documentation, the company said in a filing.</p>
<p>The probe also found that the employment eligibility of an additional 200 workers could not be verified due to discrepancies, it said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;ICE&rsquo;s notification provided no indication that the company knowingly or intentionally hired unauthorized aliens and no criminal charges have been filed against the Company or any current employees,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The company, known for its colorful T-shirts and other basics worn by urban hipsters, has made immigration reform a central theme of its corporate message.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Dov Charney has called for the legalization of foreign workers, and the company has used &#8220;Legalize LA&#8221; as a slogan on billboards and T-shirts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the past, the company has let go of workers whose papers were proven false. Company executives say American Apparel diligently complies with the law, but have pointed out that papers can easily be faked.</p>

		<p>Any company that claims they can&rsquo;t properly verify fake documents is trying to pull a fast one. The E-Verify Program is very effective. But many employers don&rsquo;t use it because they are not required by law to do so. If they were really concerned they would. </p>

		<p>The trick is to somehow consider whites human beings and not just privileged oppressors. If they just considered whites people&hellip; because everyone knows illegal immigration displaces whites (or at least they don&rsquo;t like it), then white nations around the world would enforce immigration laws too, just as non-white nations do.</p>

		<p>The American Apparel website uses a quote from Alan Greenspan (former chairman of the Federal Reserve) to support the theme of open borders.  John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s 1958 book &#8216;A Nation of Immigrants&rsquo; is also referenced.  https://americanapparel.net/contact/legalizela/</p>
<p>It appears they&rsquo;ve put a lot of effort into giving the old threadbare lies about immigration a new suit.  Too bad it&rsquo;s out of fashion.</p>

<p>How convenient for &#8220;American&#8221; Apparel. The Feds have essentially spared the executives from having to execute the messy business of conducting a layoff that the economy currently necessitates. With the added bonus of &#8220;layoffs&#8221; not having an adverse impact on its unemployment insurance premiums. (I could be wrong on the second point, California might be crazy enough to allow IAs to collect unemployment benefits.)</p>

American Apparel has always stressed that their clothing is &#8220;made in Downtown LA&#8221; and &#8220;sweatshop free.&#8221; This is of course supposed to appeal to guilty white liberals willing to pay extra for the smug satisfaction that comes from knowing that whoever sewed your shirt was treated decently rather than exploited. </p>
<p>I have no problem with the &#8220;sweatshop free&#8221; part of AA&rsquo;s slogan   &mdash;   but I&rsquo;ve always known that the &#8220;Made in Downtown LA&#8221; part means merely that their Mexican/latina seamstresses are doing their sewing north of the border in our country rather than in their own country. This, to me, is no advantage at all: I&rsquo;m all for &#8220;Buy American,&#8221; but how does legitimizing and enriching the &#8220;Reconquista&#8221; of &#8220;Aztlan&#8221; help any real American? I&rsquo;d actually prefer to buy something tagged &#8220;Made in Mexico&#8221; if it would keep those workers in Mexico so they had no incentive to cross the border. </p>
<p>And now we learn that one-third of the company&rsquo;s &#8220;American&#8221; workers aren&rsquo;t American at all, but are illegals. This ought to land American Apparel on the boycott list of every immigration patriot. </p>
