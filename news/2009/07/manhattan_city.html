			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Zambito, Robert Gearty and Greg B. Smith, New York Daily News, July 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>City Councilman Miguel Martinez Thursday admitted he&rsquo;d stolen thousands of taxpayer dollars through a series of scams that began in his first days in office.</p>
<p>Martinez pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and revealed he&rsquo;d pilfered $106,000 in Council funds through various schemes from October 2002 through spring 2008.</p>
<p>The Daily News first reported Martinez&rsquo;s self-dealing in April 2008  &mdash;  triggering a city Department of Investigation probe, which led to the criminal charges.</p>
<p>He began stealing almost from the day he arrived at the Council in 2002 to represent Washington Heights and Inwood.</p>
<p>Martinez funneled money meant for children&rsquo;s art programs and low-income housing into bank accounts he controlled under cover names. He submitted bogus invoices to pocket money meant for office expenses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Standing before a Manhattan Federal Court judge, Martinez admitted to his crimes in a matter-of-fact manner, saying he &#8220;was able to engage in these schemes because I was a New York City councilman.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Half the money came from a controversial slush fund Council members use to pay for pet projects. That fund is the subject of an ongoing inquiry by the DOI and Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Lev Dassin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent months, several politicians  &mdash;  both city and state  &mdash;  have been caught pocketing money from nonprofits they subsidized with public dollars. Some of the groups employ their relatives or legislative aides.</p>
<p>In Martinez&rsquo;s case, his sister, Maria, sat on the board of the Upper Manhattan Council Assisting Neighbors. In the past two years, Martinez sponsored nearly $800,000 for U-CAN.</p>
<p>After The News reported that conflict, DOI discovered that in 2004 and 2005, Martinez arranged for U-CAN to partner with an unnamed developer building low-income homes.</p>
<p>The developer got millions of dollars in tax credits. In return, Martinez had the developer pay U-CAN $96,000, of which $40,000 went into bank accounts the councilman controlled.</p>
<p>He did the same with the Washington Heights Arts Center, which received $163,000 in city funds since 2003, most sponsored by Martinez. In that time, the center wrote $15,000 in checks to Martinez-controlled bank accounts.</p>
<p>He also submitted invoices for bogus &#8220;expenses&#8221; for &#8220;media outreach&#8221; and &#8220;staff development.&#8221; The vendor  &mdash;  a shell corporation  &mdash;  would write checks to his bank accounts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Former U-CAN Director Tacito George was a board member of the arts group and the shell corporation. He could not be reached for comment.</p>

		<p>There is no surprise here: Third-World people create Third-World cultures.  The fastest way to turn America into a Third-World nation is to replace its former European-derived population with a Third-World population.  This process is proceeding amazingly fast   &mdash;   It will be accomplished in only one lifetime.  Never before has the world seen such a massive and rapid displacement of one people, one society, one civilization by another society.</p>

		<p>A Dominican, obviously. <br>
These are mulattoes, not the same type of &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; that most of the rest of the country thinks of when they hear the word.<br>
There is a picture of him in the original article.</p>

<p>Exactly the same result in Britain since the Empire Windrush landed West Indians in Tilbury in 1948.  It made all the sacrifice in war to keep Germans out the biggest cultural mistake in history.</p>

		<p>What is really surprising about this story is, he admitted it. </p>
<p>&#8220;Martinez admitted to his crimes in a matter-of-fact manner, saying he &ldquo;was able to engage in these schemes because I was a New York City councilman.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, &#8220;I deserve this money, because you elected me.&#8221; ALL elected officials think they deserve special treatment and privileges. </p>

		<p>I once expressed my opinion on a certain blog, that the only reason MOST Americans go into &#8220;public service&#8221; nowadays, is to enrich and serve themselves. I was answered back by a number of starry eyed(in my opinion)women, who warned me about how unpatriotic such a view was, and that I had better be careful. It didn&rsquo;t matter to them that I qualified my statement with MOST. That depressed me, not personally, but because it showed me how deluded some people still are  &mdash;  IN MY OPINION.</p>

<p>Ironically, those silly, starry-eyed women (and men too) who consider politicians above reproach are the very worst kind of &#8220;patriots&#8221;.  They are dangerous to democracy. They confuse blind loyalty with patriotism. They don&rsquo;t know what either patriotism OR democracy are all about.   These fools  are the ones who enable the crooks to do what they do and get away with it.  And still they will defend the crooks, and attack their critics!</p>
<p>I saw a video made by an Austrialian news team interviewing random Americans on the street (in San Antonio). The purpose, I suppose was to show how incredibly naive some Americans are, though it was meant to be funny   &mdash;   sort of a Candid Camera. </p>
<p>The interviewer showed passersby a map of Outer Mongolia, a large island located somewhere in the South Pacific near Tahiti, and told them that it had been determined to be a seat of terrorism, and that President Bush was urging immediate invasion and regime change.  He asked if they approved of this.  It was amazing how many agreed.  And hardly anyone questioned the map!   I remember one fat white woman saying:  &#8220;Well, he&rsquo;s our president, after all.  Whatever he says!  If he says so, it must be true.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are people who make you despair for democracy, and for our future!</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;ll bet you could go to Australia or any country, pose as a legitemate newscaster with a camera and make some people there believe equally ridiculous things about the USA or any country. </p>

		<p>What a low IQ dimwit Martinez is. The developer gets millions in tax credits. Martinez gets less than 100 grand. What&rsquo;d he do with the money. Buy a cheap Mercedes or BMW? You come from low class trash, you stay low class trash, no matter how many bucks fly in front of your face. What a chump.</p>

<p><br>
Probably so.  But what&rsquo;s your point?</p>
<p>Nowhere did I (or they) say that stupidity is restricted exclusively to Americans. </p>
<p>Bobby was referring to &#8220;starry-eyed&#8221;, gullible women who fall for the patriotic scam, and thus enable crooked politicians to get away with what they do.</p>
<p>THAT was the point.  I&rsquo;m sure Australia has some of them too. No one has a monopoly on stupidity.</p>
