<h1>Continental Divide Separates Africans, African-Americans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN, July 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African immigrants to the United States say cartoonish caricatures and a Western media penchant for reporting on Africa&rsquo;s disease, hunger and war  &mdash;  rather than the continent&rsquo;s successes  &mdash;  trivialize their cultures. They complain they have trouble dispelling the stereotypes once they arrive in the States.</p>
<p>They concede, though, the myths run both ways and some say they were surprised to find their values more often aligned with those of white Americans than African-Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before Craig [Raphael Craig, 17, of Hyattsville, Maryland] visited the continent in 2005 and 2006, he thought of Africans as &#8220;half-naked, running around with tigers in the jungle,&#8221; Craig said, confessing he was unaware tigers roam only Asia.</p>
<p>But in Ghana and Nigeria, Craig saw children playing the same games he and his siblings played. He saw many signs of modernity, including Mercedes and other brands of cars found in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;OK, this country is running how we&rsquo;re running, just two different schools,&#8221; Craig recalled thinking. &#8220;It really opened my eyes to the point that everything you see on TV is not always the actual thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Western media are doing Africans no favors, then the African media are also a disservice to African-Americans because it portrays them as criminals, some immigrants say.</p>
<p>Sandi Litia, 19, a Piney Woods graduate from Limulunga, Zambia, said she was initially scared of African-Americans because the African media show them &#8220;wearing clothes like gangsters and killing each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nkosi concurred that African media &#8220;made it seem as if they were these aggressive people that did nothing constructive with their lives except occupy prison space.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Trying to fit in</b></p>
<p>Chinedu Ezeamuzie, 21, of Athens, Georgia, arrived in 2003. He had spent the majority of his life in Jabriya, Kuwait, and came to the U.S. to pursue his education.</p>
<p>The recent Georgia Tech graduate said he considers himself Nigerian because his parents  &mdash;  both from the village of Uga  &mdash;  instilled in their four children strong Nigerian values of family, community, spirituality and self-betterment. Test your Africa knowledge with a quiz Â»</p>
<p>In Athens, Ezeamuzie found his ideals at odds with those who shared his skin color at Clarke Central High School, his first stint in a public school.</p>
<p>On his first day, he donned khakis, a button-down dress shirt and nice leather shoes. He caught the African-Americans&rsquo; attention upon stepping into the cafeteria, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They give me the look,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why is this guy dressed like the white folks, like the preppy guys?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ezeamuzie didn&rsquo;t understand why so few black students were in his advanced-placement classes. He didn&rsquo;t understand the de facto lunchroom segregation or the accusing glances he got for eating with white classmates. One classmate called him a traitor and asked, &#8220;Do you not like black people?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He found clothes akin to what he saw many African-Americans wearing  &mdash;  - baggy pants and an oversized T-shirt. He relaxed his British-trained tongue and tried out for the basketball team, the 6-foot-5 Ezeamuzie said.</p>
<p>Ezeamuzie recalled finding himself more confused by his experience with some African-Americans: Why were they so cliquish? Why did they mock students for being intelligent? Why were they homophobic and bent on using the n-word? Why did every conversation seem to involve drugs, girls or materialism?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ezeamuzie and other Africans say they feel African-Americans too often dwell on slavery and the racism that has persisted for more than a century since the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have all been tortured,&#8221; said iReporter Vera Ezimora, 24, a Nigerian student living in Baltimore, Maryland. &#8220;Now that we are free, holding on to the sins of white men who have long died and gone to meet their maker is more torture than anything we have suffered.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Values at core of misunderstanding?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many Africans come to the U.S. to escape dire conditions such as poverty or civil war. Their objectives are often advancing their education or finding good jobs, Mohammed said.</p>
<p>They also strive to reunite their families, or at least support them back home. Remittances from the U.S. to Africa total about $20 billion annually, according to the World Bank.</p>
<p>However, African immigrants find that education and good jobs elude their African-American brethren, and there is a perception that many African-American men aren&rsquo;t committed to supporting their families, Mohammed said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Myths thrive on ignorance</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Piney Woods, where about 35 of the 200 students emigrate from Africa, the school&rsquo;s president, Reginald Nichols, concurs that education is integral to understanding.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s heard Africans say the African-Americans are aggressive, while the African-Americans accuse Africans of being reserved  &mdash;  but the more they mingle the more they mesh, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the African students tell me that they have learned so much about standing up from the African-American students, and the African-American students said they&rsquo;ve learned how to simmer down, so it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing,&#8221; Nichols said.</p>
<p>Mohammed, too, said he&rsquo;d like to see more African-Americans dispelling myths about Africa, which is increasingly important as Africans in the U.S. begin wielding more economic influence.</p>
<p>The chamber estimates African immigrants have about $50 billion in annual purchasing power. Numbers from the University of Georgia&rsquo;s Selig Center of Economic Growth indicate the number is just behind the nation&rsquo;s Native American community, which had $61.8 billion in buying power last year. The entire African-American market was estimated at $913 billion and the Hispanic market at $951 billion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>iReporter Faraji Goredenna, 53, of Layton, Utah, said he encourages African-Americans to learn more about Africa and lend a hand to Africans so they know &#8220;America&rsquo;s institutions and opportunities are open to them, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;d like a symbiotic relationship, he said, explaining, &#8220;We African-Americans want to learn more about our history and culture as it exists in Africa, but we have also created a culture for ourselves here that we ask our brothers and sisters from Africa to respect.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The Africans who make it to the US for higher education are in what percentile of the IQ curve?  High-IQ people have an ability to defer gratification and plan better than low-IQ people.  They are the ones who will profit from education.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because Afrca&rsquo;s &#8220;successes&#8221; are nothing but hogwash.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to dispell a stereotype if it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>A group average I.Q. of 70 doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to a lot of admiration.<br>

		<p>I think this problem is a two way street.  American blacks tend to be spoiled, while African blacks are jealous at the higher standard of living of American blacks.</p>

		<p> When the writer talks of how the Africans and African-Americans are &#8220;starting to mesh,&#8221; it reminds me of something a retired teacher told me one time. He had taught in a suburban school just south of Indianapolis. Back in the 1970s, I think it was, court-ordered busing brought large numbers of blacks from the &#8220;inner city&#8221; to his school. Within months, he said, &#8220;the White kids had picked up all the black kids&rsquo; bad habits.&#8221;</p>
<p> The same thing will happen to the Africans. Even if they marry within their own group, instead of marrying American-born blacks, their children and grandchildren will have the attitude, the carefully nurtured sense of grievance, the aversion to the work ethic and the propensity for violence and crime that American blacks tend to have.</p>

		<p>Exactly what &#8220;African success stories&#8221; are there worth writing about? Don&rsquo;t Africans realize that the news media in the USA are governed by the maxim, &#8220;If it bleeds, it leads&#8221;? Don&rsquo;t they realize that without the stories and pictures of war, famine, disease, and death, Africa would receive no aid from other countries? </p>

		<p>First, two question based on the quote below:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have the African students tell me that they have learned so much about standing up from the African-American students, and the African-American students said they&rsquo;ve learned how to simmer down, so it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing,&rsquo; Nichols said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What does that mean Comrade Nichols, that the &ldquo;African-Americans&rdquo; have learned not to murder whites that they rape or otherwise brutalize; and that the African &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; now understand that the ghetto lottery dividends require a reverse of the same, when &ldquo;standing up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What else could that idiotic observation mean, Comrade Nichols?</p>
<p>Second, is this bit of nonsense and my observations:</p>
<p>&ldquo;African immigrants to the United States say cartoonish caricatures and a Western media penchant for reporting on Africa&rsquo;s disease, hunger and war &mdash; rather than the continent&rsquo;s successes &mdash; trivialize their cultures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, don&rsquo;t come here; get out and stay out!</p>
<p>The stupidest thing that whites ever did, was bringing Africans out of Africa as a &ldquo;cheap labor&rdquo; force and into the West. The next bit of divinely redundant idiocy, that accentuated this first act of moronically blind hubris, was to fantasize that given the same opportunities and education, that they would or even could, become our &ldquo;equalized brethren&rdquo; of color. And in a final act of egotistical morbidity, it was decided to allow the problem to be compounded and encourage newly minted Africans from that sunny wonderland to be imported as an enriching &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; addition, in the last three or four decades.</p>
<p>And in the end, who is happy with any of it?</p>
<p>Most whites, I would hazard a guess, about 75% to 85 % of them are not;</p>
<p>Most &ldquo;African-Americans&rdquo; are not, since nothing or everything granted to them by whites is ever close to enough;</p>
<p>And most African &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; are also not, since they are accepted by neither of the first two groups as &ldquo;perfect,&rdquo; and feel that they should be, because of their &ldquo;incalculable&rdquo; cultural and economic &ldquo;contributions.</p>
<p>If that isn&rsquo;t a madness worthy of both a tragedy&rsquo;s and a comedy&rsquo;s basic plot, then God had better help us all!</p>
<p>Enjoy:</p>

		<p>Last week, the New York Times had a long article about Somalians in America.  At one point, they detailed relations in Minneapolis high schools between Somalians and black Americans.  The relations were bad, mainly because the black Americans said mean things to the Somalians, such as &#8220;why you got yo&rsquo; a** up in the air, n***a?&#8221; during Muslim prayer time.  Another comment was &#8220;get yo&rsquo; skinny black a** back to Africa.&#8221;  Other comments had to do with the movie &#8220;Black Hawk Down&#8221; and 9/11.  Which, in talking about 9/11, is strange for a black American to be picking on a black African Muslim about, because the radical black talking heads in America were siding with the AQ/OBL jihadists when 9/11 happened, out of common contempt for whites.</p>

		<p>They may not understand each other, but they were both on the same page on Nov 4 2009 when they along with a rapidly growing population of hispanics,asians and muslims imposed the anti-white Kenyan bigot Barack Obama on Native Born White America. And this Kenyan president of America is hell-bent on reducing Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America.</p>

		<p>I have noticed several times in the past involving my church (Catholic,) when a visiting Black African Priest, here on assignment, would almost always be with a white parisher from that church socializing out in public (The same would be true of visiting priest from India, Jamica, etc,.)</p>
<p>This has always given me the impression that the African priest considered and held himself &#8220;above&#8221; the American black. </p>

		<p>I must admit, in my personal experience, that Christian west Africans are extremely polite and well behaved compared to their distant cousins in the Northern half of the U.S. They would make better neighbors than many other minorities in the U.S. I also had a discussion with a Puerto Rican in which he stated that he and his zombo cousin (black/native)hated and was ashamed of the behavior of most American blacks. </p>
<p>The problem is lumping all Africans together in one giant group. You could not pay me enough money to cohabit the same county with Somalians or black South Africans. The same could be said for Albanians or the &#8220;Roma&#8221; in Europe.  </p>

		<p>There are lots of African immigrants in my city, some in my neighborhood.  Of course, they&rsquo;re atypical, being a) East African (Somali, Ethiopean, Eritrean, i.e., racial hybrids)  and b) refugees (hence, more appreciative and careful of their legal status here).  But they&rsquo;re still African, so I was surprised by what appeared to be a low crime rate. among them.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out they&rsquo;re more violent than we thought.  It&rsquo;s just that they, like the Italian and Chinese immigrants before them, graciously (and wisely) keep their crimes largely within their own communities.  </p>
<p>But the fact that they&rsquo;re smarter, more industrious and better behaved than native blacks should be of little comfort.  Caribbean immigrants were also more talented and accomplished than the natives.  And look what their children gave us: Malcolm X, Harry Belafonte, Louis Farrakhan, Colin Powell, Charles Rangel, Eric Holder&hellip;</p>

Perhaps because it&rsquo;s not, as is admitted later in the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many Africans come to the U.S. to escape dire conditions such as poverty or civil war.&#8221;  So, when it&rsquo;s convenient for CNN to characterize Africa as being modern and successful, they portray it that way.  Then, when it&rsquo;s convenient to portray the opposite, they&rsquo;ll portray the opposite - within the same article!  I suspect that even the &#8220;modern&#8221; and &#8220;successful&#8221; parts of Africa are primitive by white standards because, if this were not the case, we would see many whites wanting to move to Africa for the opportunities.  People vote with their feet.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence on this site alone that refutes this claim.  But being a black voice means you never get called on to prove your ludicrous drivel.</p>
<p>This loser is just doing what countless publicity-seeking &#8220;angry blacks&#8221; have been doing (and getting away with) since the guilt-ridden 60s:</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that immigrant populations tend to be selected from either the top or bottom rung of their homeland&rsquo;s education spectrum.  Legal immigrants from Africa, East Asia and South Asia have been vetted for their ability to contribute to American society. Illegal Hispanic immigrants, OTOH, are mostly the least-skilled members of their society escaping low wages in the world&rsquo;s most economically stratified region (except Cubans, who were mostly middle class and fled Castro.)</p>
<p>African-Americans were selected hundred of years ago by their black owners for sale to slavers who wanted field hands.  Naturally these were the field hands of Africa, who had been selected for having low skills.  Of course, this was many generations ago, so the genetic legacy of intelligence selectivity today is probably low; but the attitudinal legacy of the unimportance of education has survived.</p>

		<p>No need for African immigrants to feel bad. We White Americans can&rsquo;t understand the mentality of our own Blacks either. Their mentality. Their automatic pre-disposition to crime and failure. That getting a decent education and a job is just &#8220;acting White.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Nkosi concurred that African media &#8216;made it seem as if they were these aggressive people that did nothing constructive with their lives except occupy prison space.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, at least the African media tell the truth about American blacks!</p>
<p>Good thing she didn&rsquo;t watch the American media otherwise she would have assumed Whites were &#8216;aggressive people that did nothing constructive with their lives..&rsquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d better heed what the African media report.</p>
<p>When I worked in a majority-black school, there was a very nice African man from Ghana who came to the US via Canada and was utterly clueless about American blacks   He learned quickly, very quickly.</p>
<p>He wore a suit every day and had a slight stammer  &mdash;  for this he was ceaselessly mocked by the black adult staff members and completely excoriated by the students who spent the entire class period making fun of his clothes, accent, dark color and stammer.</p>
<p>The African told me later he was absolutely dumb-struck by the unbelievable lack of respect coming from black students and adults.  He said where he was from, most of the &#8216;houses&rsquo; had dirt floors and education was a tremendous privilege.  If an African child were to disrespect a teacher such as he were disrespected every single day, that would be his last day alive and great shame would come to his family members.  He could not for the life of him believe that opportunities were thrown at American blacks which they refused to take and in fact were hostile to education.</p>
<p>He chose to live in a black community and on one of his first days there, a man approached him and kept asking for something in a strange language (turns out it was ebonics which IS a foreign language).  He couldn&rsquo;t understand a word the man said and asked &#8216;what is it you want, my brother.&rsquo;  Next thing he knew, he had a loaded and cocked gun to his chest and realized the strange man wanted his car and wallet.  He was so terrified that he missed an entire week of school.</p>
<p>After that, he refused to speak or associate with blacks and asked that his classes be changed to hispanic ESL.  He only associated with Whites and turned a deaf ear to calls of &#8216;oreo&rsquo; from the black adults, whom he regarded with utter contempt.</p>

<p>Perhaps.  But, if you read any of the race classics, you&rsquo;ll appreciate that low I.Q. is only one of the causes of black pathologies.  If such a program were instituted, my guess is that we would only end up with a class of more efficient/dangerous criminals.</p>

		<p>I always get a laugh out of the constant griping and claims of White racism by Blacks made against us. I swear, if they could find a way to &#8220;prove&#8221; it, the Blacks would even blame Whites for Blacks being born with their skin pigmentation. That it was a White plot to identify them more easily for slavery status or subsequent discrimination.</p>
<p>That absurd nonense: Black History Month, for example. If Blacks really had some genuine history, rather than the fabricated drivel taught in today&rsquo;s public schools, there would be no need for a Black History Month. Why? Because genuine history did appear in the history books we all were taught from. The whole nonsense of Black history is simply based on that Black inferiority complex felt by all Africans and/or Afro-Americans. For not being able to point to anything even remotely rivaling the accomplishments and advances made by White Europeans during the same historic time period   &mdash;   over the past 5,000 years or so. But for what they learned from White people, Blacks would still be tribal groups in the African jungles and plains.</p>

		<p>Obviously this is propaganda for open borders from the virulently anti-white network CNN.    The theme here is &#8220;don&rsquo;t oppose large scale African immigration, white people,  they&rsquo;re not like American blacks.&#8221;   Note the basically irrelevant and dishonest  but now traditional appeal to American greed:  $50 billion in African immigrant &#8220;purchasing power.&#8221;  They know their marks.)   Temporarily tossing American blacks under the bus shows you how far the left will go to keep the invasion going.  Normally CNN would rather croak than say anything bad about blacks.   It also brings up the question of why CNN thinks that African immigrant conflict with American blacks is somewhat understandable,  but white objections to black behavior are incomprehensible. </p>

<p>Exactly how are Native Born White Americans benefitting from All these LEGAL IMMIGRANT africans and asians who are flooding into America? Native Born White Americans are being rapidly race-replaced by and at the hands of ghanians,nigerians,chinese,koreans,hundus,sihks and pakistanis.</p>
<p>I knew once I read this news article that some of the &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; hear would reason along the lines that if african LEGAL immigrants weren&rsquo;t fond of American Blacks, than maybe the new west african  LEGAL immigrants are ok. Some of you who post here are incredibly foolish.</p>
<p>There was a news story posted on American Renassaince within the past few years about black female student-offspring of recent Nigerian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS- at Trinity College in Connecticut who went on line impersonating a White Supremacist on the campus. This launched a witch hunt on the campus against Native Born White Male undergraduates. She eventually was discovered to be the &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221;. The University adminstrators exonerated her and  than praised her for her efforts to raise awareness about racism on the campus. But as long as her parernts are paying their taxes there is no problem with race-replacing Native Born White Americans with post-1965 West African LEGAL IMMIGRANTS. Why do sme of you bother posting here.</p>

I would suppose (it seems only logical) that the African immigrants of today  who come here to advance their education or careers represent the most motivated  and most intelligent segment of their populations.   On the other hands,  blacks who were enslaved  [by THEIR FELLOWS, please note!] and sold to slave dealers on the coast (aside from war captives) represented the failures of their societies. They would have been (at best) an indiscriminate cross-section of the population    &mdash;    or, even worse, people who tended to get themselves into trouble with the rulers, the gods, or the tribal mores &hellip; people such as criminals and others who screwed up,  annoyed the authorities,  offended the gods,  or in other words people who might be less bright than average.    </p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know   &mdash;   history is full of highly intelligent people who got burned at the stake, beheaded, etc&hellip; (or very <i><b>nearly  </b></i>did)&hellip; for getting in bad graces with The Powers That Be.   There were the Galileo&rsquo;s, Martin Luther&rsquo;s,  Savonarola&rsquo;s, Thomas Cranmer&rsquo;s, John Huss, et al.  But, GENERALLY SPEAKING, since intelligence is a survival tool,  highly intelligent people tend to navigate the quicksands of society more deftly  and avoid getting into trouble with the authorities somewhat better than MOST of the population.  Intelligence is no guarantee of survival, but it helps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only speculating here, admittedly, but I think this would be the case.  Therefore   &mdash;    if I am right   &mdash;   the voluntary immigrants making it here  on their own from Africa today would represent a considerably different group than the indiscriminate cross-section  (or lower)  that was brought here, involuntarily,  as slaves.</p>

		<p>I am shocked at how sympathetic many posters are to the immigration of African blacks. It does not necessitate a crystal ball to see how, should the Africans become so disheartened by American Black behavior, they would instead seek to interact and inevitably breed with Whites, further leading to our inexorable demise. Mentalities of empathy must be avoided; surely many of you do not honestly think that American blacks have any more or less propensity for violence than their African cousins. Birds of a feather. One need only to look at certain parts of Africa to see that they are morbidly third world and maintain the uncivilized practices that come hand in hand with such status. </p>

<p>I remember hearing that the descendants of the &#8216;native African-American upper class&rsquo; (whatever &#8216;upper class&rsquo; means in this context) score worse on the SAT than the descendants of lower class whites. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the IQ averages would equalize in this hypothetical situation, because of the strong &#8216;regression to the mean&rsquo; effect. This effect would be just as strong with African immigrants, in fact probably stronger because of their more consistent ancestry. Or, it would certainly take a long time, and this is assuming that the so-called &#8216;white&rsquo; category remains stagnant, which won&rsquo;t be the case.</p>

<p>Regardless of the answer to that question, it still wouldn&rsquo;t matter. As has been pointed out here before, IQ is not everything.  It&rsquo;s important, but it&rsquo;s just one factor among many in a complex equation.  (In fact, as someone said above, it may just produce a more cunning criminal class.) </p>
<p>But aside from all that, I still don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t care if they come out EXACTLY equivalent to white IQs.   Or even smarter than we are!   I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re more law-abiding and more studious than we are.    I wish them well, but  I still don&rsquo;t want them coming here.   Why?   Because they are not our people, that&rsquo;s why.   This was created to be our country and &#8220;for our posterity&#8221;   &mdash;   not theirs.  Let them stay in their own. </p>
<p>The USA was not created to be a repository for all the unwanted or excess peoples of the earth. Nor was it intended for those &#8220;huddled masses yearning to be free&#8221;.  That notion was created, twisted, and tacked on more than a century AFTER the birth of the USA, by people (eg. Emma Lazarus) who had an agenda to serve. The Founders, such as Washington, Franklin, and Jefferson would have been shocked to hear it. They intended nothing of the sort. Their meaning was quite clear when they wrote (in the Constitution) of  their wish to securing  &#8220;the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.&#8221;</p>

But their must be conditions attached.  They are only here to study, not work. There must be severe penalties if they break any laws, followed by deportation and being banned from entering that country again.   Their education fees and living costs must be paid for by themselves or their government.If they are from a country that receives overseas aid from the country they are studying in, then the costs of their stay are deducted in some way from that aid.  When they are qualified, they must return to their own country and use the skills to better their own people.  If they marry and/or have children  with a white woman, then they must take them with them when they leave.  If they leave any kids behind, Madonna must adopt them.  </p>
