						<p>
							<i>Andrew Blankstein, Los Angeles Times, June 23, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Los Angeles police released security video today that captures unruly celebrants of the Lakers NBA finals victory helping themselves to merchandise at a Shell gas station convenience store blocks from the Staples Center.</p>
<p>The footage, shot June 14 by a security camera at the rear of the store in the 600 block of West Olympic Boulevard, shows a group of about two dozen men swarming the store and helping themselves primarily to juice, soda and energy drinks in a large cooler.</p>
<p>The mob shouted, &#8220;Free soda, free soda&#8221; as they grabbed merchandise in a two-minute rush in which they also smashed bottles on the floor, trampled bananas, knocked over display racks and broke a window. {snip}</p>
<p>The owner of the gas station reported $1,200 in damage and $5,200 in lost property, said LAPD Lt. Paul Vernon. {snip}</p>
<p>The LAPD strategy, which drew praise and criticism {snip} was to push larger crowds into marginal areas and chase smaller groups until they dispersed. Total damage from that night has been estimated in the tens of thousands of dollars, but LAPD officials said it was far less than the 2000 Laker victory celebration beset by violence and looting that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Notice the Orwellian journalistic &#8220;spin.&#8221;  These are not criminals and thieves, but simply unruly celebrants helping themselves out to whatever is freely available.  The LA Times kind of boils it all down into a &#8220;boys will be boys&#8221; type of thing (no pun intended).  Also, we must be glad as things are much better than in 2000.  Must be the Obama effect.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m from Pittsburgh. Incase anyone here doesn&rsquo;t know, our ice hockey team, The Pittsburgh Penguins beat The Detroit Redwings this year and won The Stanley Cup after losing last year to the Redwings. It was very exciting for any Pittsburgher even if you aren&rsquo;t a hockey fan but when we are in the Stanley Cup finals it seems like every Pittsburgher turns into a rabid hockey fan. </p>
<p>There were celebrations all weekend, alot of beer drinking and jubilation. <br>
There was absolutely  no rioting, violence or even damage to public property.</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;<br>
Now why is it that ice hockey fans never cause this type of mayhem???<br>
Ummm&hellip;could it be that they are 99% white?</p>

Dude, improper behavior costs us all money. Money for cops, money for merchandise, money for insurance, all that money goes up every year because of looters by city yoots. Never say it&rsquo;s the Insurance&rsquo;s money or the Bank&rsquo;s money when the law is broken. I live near Daytona, Black College Reunion is more expensive than any other reunion, spring break or bike week. Daytona shells out more for cops on BCR. Tell the city residents it&rsquo;s only the insurance&rsquo;s money and it&rsquo;s easy to forget. </p>

		<p>In 1895, Gustave Le Bon wrote a book, &#8220;The Crowd&#8221;, where he discussed the psychology of groups. As I recall, in a crowd, which may be physical or psychological, the individual becomes part of something larger, and loses his own sense of responsibility. In the situation here, people who would be fearful of breaking in or stealing in public view, lose their inhibitions and act out. This assumes that the individuals have some predisposition to do so, but are inhibited as individuals. I think a group of Methodist ministers might find themselves resisting the temptation to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; their team&rsquo;s success in the same way as the people here did. </p>

&#8220;&hellip;It&rsquo;s just property. Property of the insurance company at that. Sometimes it&rsquo;s easy to forget that&hellip;.&#8221;<br>
WHAT?<br>
So it&rsquo;s OK to steal?  (if your a black thug).<br>
Or, it&rsquo;s better to be stolen from, than to be gang-raped and tortured?<br>
Or, It&rsquo;s OK, because all businesses receive free insurance from the government&hellip;? -(as opposed to the reality that most small businesses in THESE AREAS have no insurance for theft or robbery; because they cannot afford the premiums).<br>
This sounds like TV logic to me.<br>
I hate to admit it, but in today&rsquo;s America, I see more REAL VALUE in the stolen bag of pork-rinds, than I see in the average black man or woman.<br>

<p>I note that some stores that locked up for some black festival thing in Texas last year, are still tied up in courts over closing because of anticipated black civil disobedience. If he had locked his doors, he would loose more money in attorny&rsquo;s fees than the theft cost, and insurance don&rsquo;t pay for that. Mustn&rsquo;t outrage the muslims or blacks.</p>

		<p>Any time there is a natural disaster or problem&hellip; like the New York Blackout, the Katrina hurricane&hellip; you can just BET Blacks will use it as an excuse to loot and steal. So why wouldn&rsquo;t a &#8220;celebration&#8221; also be a justifiable cause for looting and criminal behavior? The Rodney King rioting, the Newak rioting&hellip; 1/10th the motivation being justifiable while 9/10ths of the motivation is simply the excuse to loot, steal, rape and murder hapless victims.</p>

		<p>West LA and Beverly Hills need to secede from LA. Since blacks are at least equal to whites, and latinos are too, there will be no problem in those genius groups investing and building up an industry comparable to the film and TV industry that the Jews built up  over the past century. </p>
<p>Blacks and Latinos inferior to Jews? Perish the thought. The new Black n&rsquo;Brown LA will also have its own public schools. </p>
<p>The new system can get rid of stupid requirements like English and Math, and assure 100% graduation rates. </p>
<p>Moreover, the teachers in the new system need not be certified nor even have college degrees, a racist requirement if ever there was one. </p>
<p>The Jewish Los Angeles which would include high income whites, Iranians, high income Asians and Europeans can hire private security companies composed of former Mossad and US Special Forces, as well as British SAS. </p>
<p>Intrusion into White/Jewish LA from Black n&rsquo; Brown LA would be very expensive. </p>
<p>PS: The beach areas of LA stay white. Let Obama try a &#8220;Little Rock&#8221; and send in the National Guard. We saw where that led for fifty years. Not gonna happen a second time. What&rsquo;s Obama gonna do? Kill all of us whites, Asians, and Jews? Well, he can try. He&rsquo;ll be as successful in integration phase II as he is in Afghanistan, on the economy and in managing world energy markets. </p>

		<p>  This is totally normal African behavior. I live in Cleveland, and frequent African areas of the town. In the African areas all stores must have an armed guard at the door or else the impoverished yuffs will promptly walk out with all the stores goods and forget to pay. I have personally witnessed this myself in the black mecca of East Cleveland. Randall park, Euclid Square, and Rolling Acres are all malls in the Cleveland area that closed due to a black clientle. The amazing thing is that urban studies departments in the local colleges are scratching<br>
their heads and pondering what could possibly cause this urban deacy. In their defense, unless one actually personally witnesses black pathology one can&rsquo;t believe how bad it really is.</p>

		<p>This is so sad. Municipalities built these sports stadiums, or upgraded to better sports facilities, to increase revenue in their communities and cities. </p>
<p>At one time, I&rsquo;ll bet, store owners like this one in the article, looked forward to championship games being played a block a way from their store. They probably thought, great, a championship weekend, I&rsquo;ll make $10,000.</p>
<p>Instead, this poor owner lost $6,400 to a bunch of thugs who trashed his store and stole his merchandise.</p>

		<p>While I was in College, I was offered a job by a Security Company that got my resume, somehow, since I never sent it to them, and which they called to ask if I would be interested in working with the K-9 Team. </p>
<p>Since I have extensive background in training, I was under the initial impression that the job would entail working on the training of their dogs, and Security Officer Teams. </p>
<p>Instead, they wanted me to work as a K-9 Handler, in a Security Officer capacity, at an all Black Night Club, of course, in an all Black Neighborhood, which was to keep the Patrons in line, with the use of the dog, and a firearm, if necessary. </p>
<p>It took no time at all to refuse that job offer. </p>
<p>Just think about how bad an area has to be, as well as the people that live there are, if the Owner of a Night Club has to contract out to a Security Guard Company, not for Bouncers to do ID checks, and to ask a drunk, or unruly Customer to leave, but to keep his patrons in line, with armed Guards and Sentry Dogs. </p>

		<p>(To continue QD&rsquo;s post #1) Reason #3: The People&rsquo;s Republic of Californicate has effectively outlawed self-defense. Had the series gone the other way and blacks tried to loot stores in Orlando, there would have been a lot of dead blacks courtesy of Florida&rsquo;s &#8220;stand your ground&#8221; law. Or as we say in these parts, &#8220;You loot, we shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jer (post #5) is right about the &#8220;Black College Reunion&#8221; in Daytona Beach, even though it&rsquo;s now a shell of its former self after dozens of shops along highway A1A (the coastal road) started closing for the duration. Interesting how more than 100,000 whites can gather at Daytona for Bike Week or a big NASCAR race with near zero crime, but a fraction of that number of blacks is a crime wave waiting to happen.</p>
