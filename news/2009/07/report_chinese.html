			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erin Conway-Smith, Global Post (Boston), July 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At several Chinese-run projects in Windhoek, workers were not wearing safety helmets. The Namibian workers said they must pay for their own safety equipment  &mdash;  for example, $3.65 for a helmet, $1.20 for gloves and $9.75 for overalls. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not a nice place,&#8221; said another worker.</p>
<p>Recurring problems among Chinese employers in Africa included low wages, unpaid overtime and a lack of safety equipment such as helmets and gloves. At a construction company in Malawi, workers had to mix cement with their bare hands, the report states. In Ghana, construction workers worked nine to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, according to the report.</p>
<p>Workers for the most part had no contracts and received no benefits, even those required by law. In some countries, women were fired by their Chinese employers if found to be pregnant.</p>
<p>And at some companies, workers were &#8220;locked in&#8221; during working hours and not allowed to leave the factory even during breaks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Namibia, government and Chinese embassy officials argued that &#8220;low wages should be endured as a means towards a prosperous future,&#8221; said the report. &#8220;Let people be paid lower wages now and attract more FDI (foreign direct investment) and set up manufacturing so that the future generation will reap the benefits of the sacrifices,&#8221; a Chinese diplomat told researchers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State-owned Chinese firms have made a major push into African countries in recent years, with interests in mining and natural resources extending to investments in infrastructure such as roads and railways. China is now Africa&rsquo;s biggest trading partner.</p>
<p>Chinese construction companies have also reaped the benefits of the boom, securing contracts for large projects such as soccer stadiums and state residences. Many are built as gifts from the Chinese government.</p>
<p>In terms of infrastructure, China has a lot to offer African countries, Jauch said. &#8220;But African workers are going back to the same horrific working conditions that their fathers suffered under colonial rule.&#8221;<br>

<p>Earth to Chinese diplomat: They must not put those little highlighted &#8220;nota cultural&#8221; sidebars in the foreign language textbooks for native speakers of Chinese. If they did, you would know that Blacks are not capable of thinking in terms much beyond the next meal, drink, or sexual encounter.</p>

		<p>Let the Chinese spend their savings in Africa. I am sure their long term benefits will be marginal at best. The Western cultures have gone down this road 100 years ago and were met with failure. Good luck China.</p>

		<p>Notice how the reporter ALWAYS has to tie anything about Africa&rsquo;s failure to colonial rule as if africans could do no wrong. When the colonial powers left, they should have left africa how they found it - barbarous (no roads or other infrastructure and mass violence among many other things).</p>

		<p>There is no getting around the free market. If the companies raised wages then it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth putting the factories there. That&rsquo;s just the way it is. If the workers keep complaining then Chinese companies are going to decide it&rsquo;s not worth the hassle.</p>

		<p>The Chinese need living room.  When the West becomes too weak to defend the Africans the Chinese will move in.  Right now the nutty Western powers, or what is left of them, would put up a fuss if China started massive colonization.  They would never defend other whites, but they would defend the Africans.</p>

<p>My guess is that if the Africans get too snooty, the Chinese   &mdash;   who have never imbibed the multiculti PC Kool-Aid   &mdash;   will unleash the mother of all smackdowns on them. It won&rsquo;t take long for a race with a median IQ of ~105 to overpower one with a median IQ of ~70. &#8220;Slavery, version 2.0&#8221; will then commence with new overseers.</p>

		<p>HA HA HA HA&hellip; reality check:</p>
<p>  Best Job in China is working for a Western Foreign owned business, next is working for Western Foreign owned Joint Venture, next is working at Taiwanese subcontractor, next is working for Japanese operation, next is working for small Korean operation, the worse job any Chinese will ever have is working for ANOTHER Chinese person. </p>
<p>Other Chinese ways not  mentioned in the article:  if you are late to start work, the Chinese fine you. You not only miss pay you are fined. If you break a company tool, you are fined. If you make a mistake you are fined. If a person you recommended for hire does not work out YOU are fined and will possibly lose your job also. etc etc etc..  they are petty and ruthless when it comes to keeping the workers in line.</p>

		<p>OK, so they were unhappy with the Western world.  Now they are unhappy with the Eastern world.  What&rsquo;s next for them?  I seriously doubt India or South America is going to be much help to them.  Does make you wonder when a continent that is so laden with natural resources would ever get its own act together.  I doubt it will happen in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Grobbbbbbbbbb</p>
<p>PS:  They have to sell safety equipment to workers for the same reasons it happens in America; because the workers take them home and don&rsquo;t bring them back.  The Chinese have obviously had to resort to primitive tactics to stimulate the local memories about leaving safety equipment at home.</p>

		<p>The Chinese have flooded Africa with second-rate Chinese-made goods, ensuring that Africans have no chance at building a manufacturing base.  </p>
<p>They pay them low wages to extract resources, and then they take back the money in exchange for obsolete electronics, clothing and motorbikes. </p>
<p>To the Chinese, Africans are disposable.  They will rape the dark continent until the Africans violently rise up and throw them out. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a great video on www.wvwnews.net where a White British man tells it like it is on a show surrounded by White multiculturalists, diversity mongers and otherwise non-Whites.  And the people - including the host - just jump all over this man like the cowards that they are.  This man mentioned colonial rule in Africa I believe and knows - as most of us racially conscious Whites do - that the Africans had no semblance of a culture or civilization before the White Man came.  We are the ones that took these B_ _ _ _ _ d&rsquo;s out of the jungle and civilized them.  Oh, if only we left them there.  </p>

		<p>The Chinese may just succeed where we failed in Africa, because they are ruthlessly pragmatic, and wholeheartedly committed to the idea of self preservation and success at the expense of all others. Africans benefit by being exploited by other races, simply because it is better than being left to their own devices, and the chinese benefit from cheaper than slave labor, with the slaves staying on their own continent.</p>

		<p>Of course there is a world of difference between the old &#8216;colonial&rsquo; masters who were both government and employers at the time up to 50 or 60 years ago and these modern-day Chinese contractors who are in various African countries with the full blessing of the respective black African presidents/military rulers. Any real or perceived injustices can be laid at the door of these black rulers but since they, their family and traditional tribal affiliations all benefit directly from the deals they have done with Chinese, there is obviously very little chance of complaints from the workers being addressed properly. In most cases, the legacy of colonial rule following independence at least included a decent infrastructure of transport, educational and medical facilities and the accompanying civil service and legal system. There will be no such legacy concerning the Chinese presence as the black African governments have already have these well under their control. This situation begs the question of further cash aid or debt cancellation from the West just so long as the minerals are being exploited and exported in return for Chinese manufactured bicycles and plastic buckets for the general population and more huge cash deposits into bank accounts of the ruling elite. So, it is my opinion that the above commentators miss the point completely by omitting the corrupt black African leaders from their criticism as the Chinese will not leave having already done the deals and these reported failings concerning pay or safety matters will not bother the black leaders in the slightest as they have millions more African workers at their disposal. None of this will be of the slightest interest to NAACP as there is no &#8216;White&rsquo; involvement to blame and modern day slavery in Africa in not acknowledged for the same reason.</p>

		<p>Once china gets a foothold in africa they will just kill the africans and move in chinese to work in their chinese run factories.   Chinese will not deal with dead weight like we americans have.  IMO,the african continent might be the new China minus of course the native Africans.</p>

		<p>As someone who once worked for a Chinese employer, I am not the least bit surprised when I read about Chinese employers mistreating their employees. In my experience, the Chinese employer sees his worker pretty much as property, while Western employers are generally &#8220;hands off.&#8221; My Chinese employer did not physically abuse me, but he was a micromanager to the extreme. He worked me long hours - I assume to squeeze every penny out of me that he could - and he even threatened to pay me less money than he originally agreed to, when he felt I did something wrong. </p>
<p>My experiences were still pretty mild compared to others. </p>
<p>Ask <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3732241.stm" rel="nofollow">Nurmala Bonat</a> if she liked her Malaysian Chinese employers. </p>
<p>Just 6 dollars for an all-you-can-eat buffet in New York. How did they pull <i>that</i> off? Here&rsquo;s how (opens in new window)</p>
<p>The Onion had a nice little satire about Chinese employers in their newspaper. </p>
<p>And finally, I still remember several years ago when a female Chinese basketball player was hired to play for an American team. The American coaches were dumbfounded when they learned that she insisted on a stipulation in her contract that her American coaches could not beat her.  </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t leave my place of employment during breaks (lunch, yes).  I&rsquo;m white and I work at a factory in America (yes, a factory in America.  Quaint, huh?).  And I&rsquo;m underpaid too.  Oh, poor me.  :(  </p>
<p>Aside from the unpaid overtime, these people are just whiners.  Do we hear these complaints from workers in Thailand, for example?  What would they rather be doing, standing around swatting flies?</p>

		<p>Poster # 11 says &#8220;The Chinese have flooded Africa with second-rate Chinese-made goods, ensuring that Africans have no chance at building a manufacturing base.&#8221;<br>
Does anyone really thing that without the Chinese imports Africa would magically develop its own manufacturing base? You need a COUNTRY with a functional GOVERNMENT that enforces LAWS before you can attract investment. Furthermore, competent governments can enact protectionist policies to nurture domestic industries. This is what the USA did while it developed int he 19th century, its what Japan did to develop in the early 20th century, its what South Korea has done and continues to do. Its also what China does. But in the west today? We worship at the altar of &#8220;free trade,&#8221; which isn&rsquo;t even free, it simply means that western economies are free to eastern ones, but not the other way around. <br>
As far as China in Africa goes, the people from southern China are more resistant to tropical diseases than those from the north (never mind Europeans) and would make an ideal population base for African colonies. The Chinese government supports Mugabe and the ANC because they know that Marxist policies lead to depopulation (They have first hand experience with that). After AIDS and Marxism have reduced the African population&rsquo;s ability to resist colonization, the project will begin. Europeans will whine and complain but they certainly wont offer any real opposition as they will be too busy dealing with their own social unrest (any guess whats causing that?) The same can be said for the USA. Even if by some fluke, we still have our massive navy, the Chinese can send their colonists over in small groups. They will be called &#8220;guest workers.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I really hope the Chinese can implement the successful &#8220;one child per family&#8221; program in Africa, this was the most successful, beneficial program the Chinese Communist did for China.</p>
<p>The population explosion in Black African and Third World Muslim countries is the greatest threat to the existence of our people/culture.</p>
<p>The reality is that non White nations/civilizations like China - the international Chinese can do things Whites can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>The choice for Black Africans should be to accept the benefits of working for the Chinese - bread, work, finished products of roads, infrastructure, in return the Black Africans have to &#8220;Change&#8221; in many ways to fit in to the successful Chinese model.</p>

I wonder if he had anything to say to the Chinese elite about the Sino-African situation while he was in China. Maybe that is why is was all hair triggered to blow off a rant on a white cop. Maybe the Chinese unceremoniously dissed him. I&rsquo;m being chartible to Skip and trying to rationalize something to make him viewable in a more favorable light.   </p>

<p>Chinese are terrible employers no matter where they are.</p>
<p>They basically are paid nothing but a blanket on the floor and meagre food because whatever wage they are paid goes straight to the smuggler who brought them here.  BTW, the smuggler is usually the employer&rsquo;s brother in law.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Just 6 dollars for an all-you-can-eat buffet in New York. How did they pull that off? Here&rsquo;s how (opens in new window)&#8221;</p>
<p>Those Chinese all you can eat buffets are notorious for using workers who are fed less, get less sleep and treated worse than any slave would be.  The workers sleep in the restaurant have not bathing facilities and it is all in total violation of American workplace rules.  But somehow no inspections are ever done, any interference with these slave labor operations would be deemed &#8220;racist&#8221; and unfriendly to diverse immigrant cultures.</p>
<p>This story is one of the many reasons 1900&rsquo;s labor leaders Samuel Gompers and Dennis Kearney worked so hard to ban Chinese from destroying the American working class by keeping them out of America.</p>

		<p>Typical selective Western reporting.</p>
<p>The West seems to have nothing better to do than sow discord - whether it is within China or between China and non-Chinese.</p>
<p>By and large the Chinese presence in Africa is welcomed by an overwhelming majority of Africans. The Chinese are building up infrastructure, assisting these countries to develop, but at the same time not being sanctimonious prigs lecturing the Africans on how to run their own affairs. That is why China is a welcome partner for many Africans.</p>
<p>This authoritative Pew Research poll mentions in <i>How the world sees China</i>:</p>
<p>&#8220;China&rsquo;s fans are most prevalent in the neighboring Asian countries of Malaysia (83% favorable), Pakistan (79%), Bangladesh (74%), Indonesia (65%), as well as in most African countries (92% favorable in both Ivory Coast and Mali and between 67% and 81% in Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia).&#8221;<br>

<p>Before China does anything approaching what the Germans did in Namibiba, the Belgians did in the Congo, or the British in Kenya,<br>
Westerners should just keep quite, for fear of looking like hypocritical fools.</p>

		<p><i>As someone who once worked for a Chinese employer, I am not the least bit surprised when I read about Chinese employers mistreating their employees.</i></p>
<p>The worst Chinese employers can be terrible, but the better ones are often better than any Western employer.</p>
<p>Western employers will do things by the book, but Chinese employers will often give huge bonuses if the company does well. In fact the bonus culture is prevalent in Hong Kong and Singapore. </p>
<p>A European friend of mine working for a construction company in Singapore in the 1990s would more than once received six months salary in bonuses before the Chinese New Year. Two or three months is not at all unusual.</p>
<p>But obviously when times are not so good, everyone will hunker down.</p>

		<p>China is over populated and needs to find a place for it&rsquo;s people. They have the numbers and the economic power to displace the Africans. If we decided to interfere with their plans(which very well maybe colonization) they can threaten to stop buying our debt and dump some of their dollars for gold or Euros. We are spending billions on the Africans for humanitarian reasons, while China is making billions because China could care less if Africans produce armies of AIDS infected babies. </p>

		<p>Africa offers some good opportunities for Chinese colonization, the Cape Province being one and Madagascar being another (I&rsquo;ve always thought Madagascar would be a fantastic place for a modern country). Unfortunately for the Chinese, the &#8220;one child policy&#8221; means they will be as old as the Japanese are now in twenty years. If whites started having babies again (or manufacturing them) we would be in the driver&rsquo;s seat again.</p>

		<p><i>The population explosion in Black African and Third World Muslim countries is the greatest threat to the existence of our people/culture.</i></p>
<p>The white race is, numerically speaking, not doing too badly at all. There are about 1.2 billion pure whites in the world, 1.4 to 1.5 pure NE Asians, and about 800 million to 900 million blacks.</p>
<p>The white race has greater numbers than the black race, and are in the same ballpark as Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more if one was to expand one&rsquo;s definition of &#8216;white&rsquo; to include very fair North Africans, Turks, Iranians, Lebanese etc - the number of whites in the world would be approaching the number of Chinese.</p>
<p>And if it is Caucasoid against Mongoloid - there are more Caucasoids in the world than Mongoloids.</p>
<p>Sure whites are a minority in the world, but so then are Chinese, SE Asians, Blacks, and Arabs.</p>
<p>I believe Steve Sailer has written about this before - all this talk about dwindling white numbers and whites facing extinction is just a load of rubbish.</p>

<p>Perhaps not extinction but a severe decrease in numbers in the near future. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The white race is, numerically speaking, not doing too badly at all&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You are wrong.</p>
<p>According to the National Policy Institute:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.As a percentage of world inhabitants the white population will plummet to a single digit (9.76%) by 2060 from a high-water mark of 27.98% in 1950.</p>
<p>The big population story of the 21st Century is shaping up to be the status reversal of whites and blacks&hellip;. A side bar will be the single digit minority role that whites will assume. Of the 7 population groups studied only whites are projected to sustain an absolute decline in numbers.</p>
<p>From 2010 the white population will decline while blacks will add 1.2 billion to their numbers&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/lto39v</p>
<p>Did you catch the part about a decline in Whites in absolute numbers?</p>
<p>BTW: According to the report</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; The other groups measured in the study were the Central Asians (Indians), East Asians (Chinese and Japanese), the Southeast Asians, Arabic (North Africa and the Middle East) and Amerindian-Mestizo (Mexican and Central America). All these groups will experience a population growth&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan reports (based on the National Policy Institute&rsquo;s figures):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Two hundred million White people, one in every six on earth &mdash; a number equal to the entire population of France, Britain, Holland and Germany &mdash; will vanish by 2060&hellip;By 2050, a fourth of all the people of Eastern Europe will have vanished. Ukraine will lose one-third of its population. Russia, 150 million at the breakup of the Soviet Union, 142 million today, will be down to 108 million&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites are not &#8216;holding their own&rsquo;,  their numbers are declining, precipitously it seems. I don&rsquo;t foresee this trend turning around.  </p>
<p>Feel free to refute the National Policy Institute&rsquo;s figures by providing sources for your contention that &#8216;Whites aren&rsquo;t doing too badly.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I think that it would be safe to predict that the Chinese will do the White race a great service by proving how generous and caring Whites have been toward Africa (and all third world nations).  They will do this through their own economic expansion as illustrated by this article.  </p>

		<p>I wonder what the radical multicults would say about this story.  I mean the ones who insist blacks can compete with other races.  </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s another country having to move into Africa to do things as simple as construction work because the blacks just don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to come up with a plan of action themselves&hellip;&hellip;.on any kind of improvements.</p>
<p>As time goes by and the Chinese get tired of the lack of learning and the numerous problems they have with these people they&rsquo;re going to take an even harder line.</p>
<p>And Obama wants to FORCIBLY integrate blacks into ALL PROFESSIONS into the US.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s successful, we will be an &#8216;undeveloped nation&#8221; for certain.</p>
<p>But, come to think of it we will be anyway, because we&rsquo;re waiting for the other shoe to drop on the economy right now, only this time worse than before.  </p>
<p>The jobless rate is causing many home owners to undergo foreclosure, and we still haven&rsquo;t been hit to the fullest by the commercial real estate plummet&hellip;but we WILL.</p>
<p>I would rather see the nation collapse than have it inundated and run by black morons.</p>

		<p>Heh, heh, heh, heh, ha, ha, ha!  &#8220;Not a nice place&hellip;&#8221;?  They haven&rsquo;t seen anything, yet.  The Chinese fully expect to bribe African &#8216;governments&rsquo; to offer up their own people as slaves, to be worked, quite literally, to death.  And the Chinese will not be disappointed.  Let the Africans reap the rewards of having expelled and displaced &#8216;Colonial&rsquo; whites.  And let the Chinese assume the burden of feeding and medicating the Dark Continent (they won&rsquo;t).</p>
