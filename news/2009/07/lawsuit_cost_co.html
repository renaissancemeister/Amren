<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Racial-discrimination lawsuits against a private Montgomery County swimming club over its revoked contract with a Philadelphia day camp could cost enough to threaten the Valley Club&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>Attorneys, club members, and tax records indicated that a pair of federal-court lawsuits  &mdash;  one filed, one promised  &mdash;  could cost the club more money than it has and possibly leave board members liable for civil-rights verdicts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only asset we have is the land, which housing developers have been trying to buy for years,&#8221; said Bonnie Bacich, a Valley Club member for 30 years.</p>
<p>The club has been targeted for how it treated 65 children who traveled with the Creative Steps Inc. day camp to the Huntingdon Valley club June 29. The children said they heard racial comments by club members who left the pool when they arrived. The club later refunded money paid by Creative Steps and revoked its summer swimming contract.</p>
<p>The club also ended contracts with two other day camps, but neither has protested the matter. The Valley Club says all the contracts were ended because of safety issues from overcrowding, not racial prejudice.</p>
<p>One lawsuit was filed Friday by a parent, and Creative Steps executive director Alethea Wright and dozens of other parents said at a news conference Monday that a second discrimination suit was coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;The outrage of having to go through this, with an African American president in 2009  &mdash;  we don&rsquo;t take this kind of stuff lightly in America anymore,&#8221; said Montgomery County civil-rights lawyer Brian Wiley, who is not involved in the case lawsuit.</p>
<p>Wiley said fighting the issue in court could prove a fiscal challenge to the tax-exempt, nonprofit club, which listed $210,193 in assets in its most recent federal filing. &#8220;That club&rsquo;s got to settle that case,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Valley Club president John G. Duesler Jr.  &mdash;  who has offered to resign over the imbroglio  &mdash;  said yesterday the club was searching for an attorney.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The legal threats to the club if the racial-discrimination allegations are proved can be considerable, experts said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Duesler said the club has 150 member families, and its 2007 IRS filing says it spent almost its entire year&rsquo;s revenues of $100,267 to cover operating expenses. Having to pay taxes would shift that balance.</p>
<p>Wiley, the civil-rights attorney, said federal law allows for a nonprofit organization&rsquo;s board members to be held individually liable in a discrimination case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being private is not going to help them,&#8221; Wiley said, &#8220;and being nonprofit is not going to help them.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I hope all private swim clubs across the U.S. take note of this, because their days are numbered. A new shakedown tactic has proven successful, and just like with Dennys restaurants, blacks are going to milk this for every penny they can get. Expect a whole slew of racist swim clubs to be exposed very soon.</p>

		<p>&#8220;they heard racial comments by club members who left the pool when they arrived.&#8221;</p>
<p>And who were the parties in the pool? I believe the previous article described them as other kids. &#8216;Racial comments&rsquo;, Too sensitive for their fragile ears? These are the same folks who use the term &#8216;redneck&rsquo;, a racial slur, in order to prove to everyone else how enlightened they are. And those are the more enlightened comments.  </p>

<p>That is always the black tactic - embellish the story in their favor.  I don&rsquo;t doubt there was a visible reaction when the large black group arrived but I doubt they were shouting insults.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever in my life heard whites shouting insults at a group of blacks.  Blacks and their low self esteem is the real story here.</p>

<p>So there is the end of freedom.  You no longer have the right to have a private club, unless of course the you are black.  If you are black you can have any club you want and you are free to broadcast that it is for blacks only.  </p>
<p>We need one set of laws.  Either blacks should disband all clubs and organizations based on race, or they should shut up and stop the hypocrisy.  The club that is getting sued should enroll in a black club, black college, black caucus, and see how far they get.  They should join a swim club in Harlem and when they hear a racial slur or are bothered in any way, they should sue.</p>
<p>This club was targeted, pure and simple.</p>

		<p>How about it any white realists out there that are lawyers willing to take a case for racial justice pro bono?Make them prove their case and make them pay for false allegations.Take these people to court and sue them for libel.Don&rsquo;t settle out of court fight til the end.To this day the news has not reported any racial statement made by one person.If one person at the club said something how could the whole club be held responsible . Anyone that speaks at any club represents everyone at the club?I think they would have a hard time connecting a statement to the management at the club.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how they could be sued.  They are a private club.  Original civil rights legislation only applied to public accomodations (hotels, restaurants, bars, etc.).  Is a private swim club now considered a public accomodation?  If so, whatever ever happened to our liberty?  Whatever happened to our right of freedom of association?  Our government has become tyrannical. </p>

		<p>One of the terrible realities of defending yourself in US court from lawsuits is win or lose, your still stuck paying your own legal fees. </p>
<p>Unless the club board members can obtain legal council pro- bono, they couldn&rsquo;t possibly prevail. You can bet your life the black&rsquo;s lawyers are pro- bono. And to add insult to injury and hypocrisy, they are probably white lawyers who belong to their own &#8220;all- white clubs&#8221;. There&rsquo;s a kick in the teeth for ya&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In some counties if the plaintiff loses the lawsuit, they are liable for paying the defendants fees as well. This arrangment curbs the number of frivolous cases and is a disinsentive for ambulance chasing money grubbing lawyers. If this was the arrangement in our court system, much of this black shakedown nonsense would cease!</p>

		<p>This is truly wonderful! John Duesler is a gung-ho Obama activist.  Google his name and Obama.  </p>
<p>He was very active in the Obama campaign and is about as self-hating a white man as you can get. </p>
<p>The guy is devastated, I am sure, to see his wonderful fearless leader and all the other Phillie Obamanauts run for cover, leaving him high and dry. </p>
<p>All his wonderful, sweet caring liberalism isn&rsquo;t going to save him how!  He is a member of the white race, and like blacks in South Africa, like Sherman McCoy in &#8220;Bonfire of the Vanities&#8221;, they are going to destroy him!</p>
<p>One slip up, one misunderstanding, one sensationalist news article, and he (like all of us white folks) is dead meat.</p>
<p>Watch what Obama does to his beloved white followers.  </p>
<p>Watch what he does to John Duesler. </p>
<p>Watch all the other white Obamanauts, cringe and whine and refuse to answer Duesler&rsquo;s phone calls as they all run for cover.</p>
<p>His OWN PRESIDENT, the man he fought to elect, is going to send hisFederal Prosecutors to Phillie to destroy him! </p>

		<p>Psst&hellip;.Hey my fellow Amren commonsense readers, this is the workings of the self-hating white liberal at its best.  If the club is a private club, then what was those &#8220;outsiders&#8221; doing there in the first place?  Aren&rsquo;t there other swimming pools in Killadelphia?  I mean what is the significance of this utter non-sense?  If a club is suppose to be &#8220;Private&#8221; and members have to pay a fee&hellip;&hellip;see what I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;?  </p>
<p>Stay tuned for more of this nonsensical, white liberalism at its best or should I say worst?  </p>

		<p>Our community pool figured a relatively easy way to keep blacks and Mexicans out: charge $8.00 per adult and $6 per child. Given the choice between swimming or buying a Big Mac with Biggie Fries and a large drink, ghetto kids make just the choice you&rsquo;d expect.</p>

		<p>Ahhhh.  In the comments to the original article:</p>

Seems like the club president, Duesler, founded a peace group that celebrated Martin Luther King&rsquo;s birthday in Philly. He&rsquo;s more likely heartbroken his plan to help inner city kids failed IMO. See this link which I saw elsewhere: https://peaceactionpa.org/Ethnic_Peace_Fest_20Jan08.html</p>
<p>I bet the whole imbroglio stems from the club president stroking his liberal-progressive inclinations by inviting a troop of intercity blacks into what was described as a private, all-white community swim club, and getting the club financially ruined, possibly along with individual board members.  If that is indeed the case, I think it&rsquo;s great.  It&rsquo;s a perfect morality play for the Obama Age.</p>

		<p>This is the way that the ghetto lottery works! If you get thrown out of some place nice irregardless of the real reason you were removed, claim that you heard all sorts of racial slurs as you were leaving and then sue sue sue! It does not matter if anyone actually said any slurs, nobody will come clean and say that they said anything but you will be believed no matter what. Pretty soon you will own whatever business or other entity threw you out for your bad behavior. </p>

		<p>Well the first mistake by the club was to accept the check for $1940<br>
The second mistake was trying to kick the city yoots out of the pool after they had paid already. You have to admit that was wrong on the pool owners part.<br>
The third mistake was the comment about the &#8220;complexion and atmosphere&#8221; of the pool. If the Max Capacity of the pool is stated, and too many people enter, then point to the sign. No one would argue with a safety regulation. <br>
Fourth mistake, trying to give the money back. That&rsquo;s like saying your money&rsquo;s not good around here. Duh! Honor you contract when you make one. If it&rsquo;s a bad contract for you, then don&rsquo;t make another. Learn and Burn. But honor the contract.</p>
<p>So many mistakes were made it&rsquo;s as if they were done intentionaly. <br>

Don&rsquo;t rent a private club out to anyone except members who want to have private parties, or perhaps a local athletic competition. I have no sympathy for this club or its idiotic President.

		<p>It&rsquo;s not the blacks that are the problem but the people behind the scenes that are empowering them to file these kinds of lawsuits.  Most of the attorneys in so called civil rights organizations are of a certain religious minority.  The best way to fight back is through our Middle Eastern policy.  Cut of all aid and weapons sales and start selling arms and technology to the Arabs.  We can stop this nonsense once and for all.</p>

		<p>There are losses and gains for us here: Whites lose a swimming pool.  The White race gains a number of racially aware middle class people.  The Whites who lose their club will join other clubs, and those other clubs will profit from their experience: No &#8220;Ghetto Days&#8221; will be arranged at the clubs these White people move to.  Their children will see what comes from associating with Blacks, and if their parents are liberals, the kids will see through their hypocrisy.  I call it a win for us.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised no one has mentioned it up &#8216;til now, but one of the joys of a vibrant and diverse swimming pool is how the black kids will choose a particular corner to urinate in. They somehow believe that it stays in place. In the corner.<br>

		<p>The swim club took the money and were obligated to provide the facility. I do not know what really happened but stupidity has a way of taxing itself and they were stupid for 1)renting the rights to use a private facility in the first palce, what is the point of having private membership. 2)reacting the way they did. Did they not know who they were renting to?</p>
<p>They brought this on themselves and i dont blame the camp people for being pissed.</p>

<p>Gee! Do you thnk so?<br>
Does anyone from Philly remember the Boulevard Pools that were located in Northeast Philly along Roosevelt Blvd. somewhere between Cottman and Princeton avenues.  <br>
Anyway, it was a membership club and totally White as was that section of Northeast Philly back in the day. Blacks tried to integrate it and were discouraged for a while until the owners gave in to the constant pressure and that spelled the end for the pools. The usual obnoxious and sociopathic behavior of the blacks e.g assaults on white patrons, loud screaming, unsafe behavior in the pool and lack of personal hygiene intimidated the whites to the point were they stopped coming and the pools eventually ceased to exist. <br>
The same thing happened with two amusement parks, Woodside and Willow Grove that eventually closed beginning with Woodside. </p>

<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t doubt there was a visible reaction when the large black group arrived but I doubt they were shouting insults. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever in my life heard whites shouting insults at a group of blacks. &#8220;<br>

		<p>I guess these Inner City kids can now come to your house and crash on the couch, watch your T.V., eat your food in your Refrigerator, and then take your car for a drive. Why not? Your home isn&rsquo;t &#8220;Private Property&#8221; any more. It now belongs to the Blacks who will scream &#8220;Discrimination&#8221; if you fail to admit them. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surreal. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Duesler is feeling that way right now, as he tries to think of a way out of this box he is in. </p>
<p>If only he used some common sense, and simply said,&#8221;No&#8221; when the Urban Charity cases wanted to use their private pool. </p>
<p>And to think that Duesler organized the Martin Luther King Day events, and Campaigned for Barry, too. Now, there&rsquo;s a real kick in the teeth. A Liberal being beaten down by the ones he loves, and by policies he, and his kind, put in place, around Our Necks.</p>
<p>I wonder what his thoughts on Diversity are now? He probably can&rsquo;t even say the word &#8220;Diversity&#8221; without choking on it. </p>
<p>In related Barry news, World Net Daily.com had an article on their site that stated that a U.S. Army Reserve Major, who had orders to Deploy to Afghanistan, refused to go, claiming that Obama is not a &#8220;Natural born&#8221; Citizen, and is ineligible to be President, making ALL of his orders Illegal. </p>
<p>The Army lost their case, and simply recinded the orders that the Army Reserve Major had to Deploy. Yet, the Liberal Media is not covering this story at all. There&rsquo;s a big surprise. </p>

		<p>I have a prediction for the Valley Swim Club. Something like your experience happened to the community swim club in the suburban neighborhood I grew up in. The pool was open to community residents of the incorporated development for paid dues. After many years of operation a group of blacks from a nearby section 8 apartment complex sued to gain membership and claimed racism was keeping them out. To make a long story short, the facility was closed and the place that generated many summers of happy memories for thousands no longer exists. The facilities provided the pool, swimming lessons, childrens events, a hall that hosted teen dances during the summer and was available for resident social events. My parents 25th anniversary party was held there. The neighborhood still exists, but it is no longer the all white &#8220;Leave it to Beaver&#8221; place it once was. The house that I grew up in the 60&rsquo;s was occupied by blacks, but is now abandoned and deteriorated. A couple of years ago at the end of the street a man was shot and killed in his car and crashed into the front of the house that a childhood friend grew up in. In the neighborhood where my parents felt comfortable leaving the doors unlocked and the house and car windows open during the summer months, now bars on the ground floor windows and dead bolt steel doors are the norm. The main difference? The area is now the &#8220;home&#8221; to many blacks and mestisos. And with them came the deterioration of the once desirable community. Any other swim clubs out there would be wise to follow a bit of advice. When the club is approached by a &#8220;day camp&#8221; to provide a place for the &#8220;kids&#8221; to swim, do a little checking up on the &#8220;kids&#8221; and the adults in charge of the group. I realize that the Valley Club was looking for a little revenue, but maybe an increase in membership fees would have been better than what&rsquo;s coming.  </p>

<p>It seems that the club suffered from gross mismanagement all around.  And that Duesler, given the new information about his past left-wing activities, seems like a real idiot.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he solicited the blacks&rsquo;  business or even went and offered them an invitation.  But he should have known that when you&rsquo;re collecting money to get in   &mdash;    when you&rsquo;re practically selling tickets   &mdash;    you&rsquo;re conducting a business operation;  it&rsquo;s not a &#8220;private&#8221; club anymore.  Worst of all is when you sell them a &#8220;ticket&#8221; and then take it back!   What a jerk!  He deserves whatever he gets from this.  No doubt it&rsquo;s been long coming.

That&rsquo;s an excellent point.  I don&rsquo;t see how the pool could be held responsible for someone&rsquo;s  comments.   There&rsquo;s no way the pool can control people&rsquo;s speech, if non-employees&hellip; (especially so when unsubstantiated hearsay).  But regardless of that,  even if legally unprovable, this prize Duesler, seems to have done enough screwing up by starting the whole mess in the first place. <br>

<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ll wind up closing anyway. If blacks are allowed to run things, whites will get fed up with being harassed. It&rsquo;ll be like the malls &mdash; white shoppers got sick and tired of blacks harassing them and there went the business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; That&rsquo;s what happened at our local swim club, which was also private - but opened to the public - in the 1960s.  All the kids used to to there nearly everyday.  It was a cool scene, a juke box, life guards that did not harass the kids and kids having a good time in and around the pool.  Then, the local Air Force Base imported a bunch of Black families from Georgia.  Blacks came to the pool and began to harass the White kids, &#8220;Lend me a quarter?,&#8221; became the common form of harassment for the boys.  For the girls it was sexual and unending.  The swim crowd began to thin out.  One summer of that and the pool closed forever.  I remember seeing the pool a few years later, filled in with sod and weeds growing in it.  That was 1965 and the last summer of America in America.  The transistion began that year and now we are prisoners in our own country.<br>

		<p>Sadly this is the way blacks operate now.  It is OK for them to have separate TV Channels, and separate proms and graduations, and everything else.  But let a White person try and have something and they sue and try and destroy it.  Personally I favor this approach because it is furthering White identity and waking Whites up to the reality of the racial dangers that exist and the media hides.</p>

That being said, private swim club or not, the day campers paid their money and they should get the use of the facilities as agreed upon as it was a valid contract. If there was a problem with their behavior or there was not sufficient adult supervision per written club guidelines then sure, document to the Nth degree and kick them out, refund their money and bar them from returning. </p>

It is obvious that blacks will do every thing they can to get into the white gene pool as well as water pool. Whites darn well have the right to preserve their hard won racial existance and unless they get their audacity back they will be overcome by the more physically aggressive invasive black specie.

<p>So we can look forward to a new round of civil rights lawsuits targeting tennis clubs,golfing clubs,sailing clubs,heck-pottery clubs for all I know.</p>
<p>All that they need to do is to find a private club of any sort that&rsquo;s focused on activities that are traditionally engaged in by summer campers,and show up demanding to participate. Then get offended by something that happens-or that is said to happen-while they&rsquo;re in attendance.</p>

Well, yes.  That&rsquo;s true in a general sense.  But in this case it&rsquo;s more complicated.  </p>

I live about 10 minutes from this pool in Hatboro, Pa. My guess is it will be closed down, sold and homes will be constructed. I do not understand why the children did not use pools down in Philly. This should never have happened. This area used to be nice but now sometimes I feel like I am in philadelphia instead of the suburbs. This is so silly, the camp received a refund. Why is it blacks scream and complain every chance they get???</p>

		<p>&#8220;How could this private club be dumb enough to make a contract with a Philadelphia day camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you read Steve Sailer? The Stuff White People Like crowd learn about race relations from Sesame Street. Mostly they live in all white enclaves and send their kids to mostly white private schools. They have no experience with the lumpen-black majority population who are &#8220;keepin it real.&#8221;</p>

  Question. Whatever happened to the policy of &ldquo;We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.&rdquo; <br>
Isn&rsquo;t this a private establishment that we are talking about?<br>

<p>Not if it behaves like a commercial establishment by selling admisions to the general public.  That&rsquo;s not what a &#8220;private&#8221; club is supposed to do. They left themselves wide open for this. </p>
<p>In fact, come to think of it, that sappy, lefty manager could not have set it up better for the blacks if he (and they) had PLANNED it this way!   Hmmm.  Just a thought.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ever been to a pool or playground that has 60 black children suddenly invade it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ever been anyplace when 60 kids of any race show up? Kids are kids and they act like kids no matter what their race is. I remember all the times the lifeguards was blowing their whistles and yelling at me and my friends to cut our the horseplay when we were at the community pool.</p>

That&rsquo;s true &hellip; but only up to a point.<br>
Yeah, kids are kids. They can be wild and rowdy and noisy. <br>
But black kids are MORE!</p>

<p>Well, maybe Duesler is part of the set-up, a Manchurian candidate Valley Club President, &#8220;who has offered to resign over the imbroglio.&#8221;  I&rsquo;ve seen it before. I&rsquo;ll bet he won&rsquo;t lose any money over it.  Maybe he&rsquo;s already planned to move.  Maybe it&rsquo;s all political theater.  Is this really big news or just a media event? We should be careful not to assume the actor is the role he&rsquo;s playing in these sorts of things.  Who is Duesler really?</p>

That is an EXCELLENT question!  It&rsquo;s hard to imagine anyone could genuinely be that dumb   &mdash;   not only to allow them to come in, but to SELL them admission  (which made this a commercial transation, not private) &hellip; and then, having taken their money, turn around and kick them out!</p>
<p>And given the new knowledge that&rsquo;s surfaced about his background, it&rsquo;s even stranger.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Formerly, in a court of law, that would get you absolutely nowhere. But in the fantasy world of civil rights, anything today is possible  &mdash;  if the government really wants to get you.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;And with Eric Holder as AG and Obama as Pres., I wouldn&rsquo;t consider anything too far out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here in the UK, non-whites especially blacks, only have to perceive an incident to be racist with absolutely no evidence to back up their accusation(s) and the courts will find in their favour.</p>
<p>Of course, this brand of victimhood <i>justice</i> doesn&rsquo;t work when it&rsquo;s whites who&rsquo;re on the receiving end of non-white racism.</p>
