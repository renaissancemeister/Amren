			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Pazzano, Toronto Sun, July 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A jealous refugee was sentenced yesterday to life in prison without parole eligibility for 18 years for brutally killing his Ryerson student girlfriend  &mdash;  cutting her jugular vein and slashing his victim&rsquo;s face after she was dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;He vilified the victim and consistently seeks to blame the victim,&#8221; said Madam Justice Anne Molloy in sentencing Arssei Hindessa, 33, for the May 15, 2006, murder of Natalie Novak, 20.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was as close to first-degree murder without actually being first-degree murder. This domestic violence was marked by brutality and gratuitous violence,&#8221; said Molloy.</p>
<p>She determined that Hindessa would have to wait until 2024 before he could apply for parole. In March, a jury acquitted him of first-degree murder, deciding he was guilty of the lesser offence of second-degree murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the final instalment in the history of domestic violence,&#8221; said Molloy, adding that he repeatedly broke court orders prohibiting him from seeing Novak.</p>
<p>He assaulted her twice in public places: Once at a party and another time in a night club.</p>
<p>While Novak fought for her life, Hindessa stabbed her nine times in the chest and once in the back. He savagely cut both her carotid artery and jugular vein and slashed her face after she died.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was extreme butchery and degradation,&#8221; Molloy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of these people will ever be able to erase these last horrific images of Natalie,&#8221; said the judge. &#8220;She was a kind, vibrant and exceptional young woman who was adored and treasured by her family and friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Novak informed friends that she planned to sever their relationship the night she was killed, said Molloy.</p>
<p>After a night of socializing with Novak and her friends, Hindessa and Novak quarreled in her bedroom. Hindessa left, &#8220;selected the sharpest knife&#8221; in her kitchen, returned to her room and locked the door. He attacked her as she lay in her bed, said Molloy.</p>
<p>Hindessa was captured by police two hours later.</p>
<p>Novak&rsquo;s parents, Ed and Dawn, applauded the judge for sending a strong message that violence against women is being taken seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;The victim rarely realizes how dangerous the situation is and needs to be protected from the perpetrator,&#8221; said Ed Novak, who stared at the face of his daughter&rsquo;s killer in court and saw &#8220;no remorse whatsoever.</p>
<p>&#8220;The perpetrator shouldn&rsquo;t have the carte blanche to abuse the victim and remain free to do it again and again; to ignore restraining orders, bail and probation conditions with impunity,&#8221; Novak said.</p>
<p>The killer was physically abusive and a philanderer who financially exploited his wife, Indisar Buba-Rashid, during their four-year marriage, court heard. Hindessa started seeing Novak a few months before his wife left him in November 2004, court heard.</p>
<p>The judge dismissed Hindessa&rsquo;s testimony that he saw Novak as &#8220;seven-headed&#8221; beast or devil when he stabbed her as a &#8220;complete fabrication.&#8221; The jury rejected Hindessa&rsquo;s story that he was breaking it off with Novak to re-unite with his wife when Novak became violent with him, said Molloy.</p>
<p>She accepted that Hindessa endured torture in Ethiopia. But she said she couldn&rsquo;t say whether mental illness had anything to do with the slaying because of Hindessa&rsquo;s dishonesty, both as a witness and as a patient to various psychiatrists.</p>
<p>Crown attorneys Mary Humphrey and Karen Simone argued that Hindessa should serve between 18 and 25 years to protect the public, especially women.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a tragedy for everybody, a young man will spend most of his adult life in prison and it&rsquo;s a tragic loss of life for a young woman,&#8221; said Hindessa&rsquo;s lawyer, Aston Hall.</p>

		<p>The ignoramous parents of this girl sure doesn&rsquo;t seem to get the message that they allowed their daughter to date and live with a Black man. THAT is the message Ed Novak. He and his wife were just glad that the violence against women is being taken seriously?  What?</p>
<p>Hey parents, how about protecting your daughter in the first place and instilling in her the dissapportinate of abuse by black men of White women? Or how about telling your daughter that RACE does matter? That she should never ever date anyone outside her race. Maybe if they instilled that in her while she was growing up she would not be in her grave. I have no sympathy for her parents. </p>

		<p> I don&rsquo;t know where the photo of Novak came from   &mdash;   there didn&rsquo;t appear to be one with the original story. But I think it&rsquo;s very significant that the Toronto Sun published no picture of Hindessa. And, except for the phrase &#8220;jealous refugee&#8221; in the first paragraph, and the allegation deep in the story that the murderer &#8220;suffered torture in Ethiopia,&#8221; we are not really given any hint that Novak&rsquo;s killer was not a good ole White boy, instead of a brutal African immigrant who latched onto a lovely young Caucasian woman, then killed her when things didn&rsquo;t go to suit him.</p>
<p> And for the life of me I can&rsquo;t understand how a jury would not have convicted him of first-degree murder. What more did they need   &mdash;   a surveillance video of the actual attack? And given his history of repeated domestic violence, and the brutality of the murder, why should he EVER be given a chance at parole? Canadian law seems &#8220;passing strange.&#8221;  </p>

<p>How about violence by blacks against white women.  I mean there&rsquo;s so much of it somebody could write a book about just the recent cases.</p>
<p>Ed and Dawn can take the blame for their daughter&rsquo;s death, as can any white parents who allow their daughters to even consider dating black primitives.  I mean, don&rsquo;t they read about the numerous black on white killings?</p>
<p>The man was married, 13 years older, probably ghastly unattractive and a bad personality to boot, yet this foolish woman decided to take up a relationship with him.</p>
<p>Domestic violence in the Western world has nothing to do with this case.  Where this criminal is from, domestic violence is known life as usual.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a white fool born every minute.</p>

		<p>Very very sad. People in the US and in Canada have been so brainwashed about the races and the dangers of interracial dating that it does not have the social stigma that it used to and should still have. I was taught that Blacks were people with human rights but even so I did not have to associate with them as either friends or dating partners. Once a woman is known to date blacks or God forbid has a child with them almost no White man will have anything to do with them, even if they wise up. Black men are really aggressive and will often manhandle a White woman they want to date and almost stalk them until the woman gets them to lay off or stupidly agrees to date them. Since most young White women have been told that the worst thing to be called would be &#8220;racist&#8221; when the guy calls her racist for not wanting to date him then the poor girl feels that there is nothing left for her to do but date the man. </p>
<p>I have said it before, get you kids (especially your daughters) out of public school. If you cannot possibly home school or place them in a private school then do your best to get them in a school that is less than 5 percent black. </p>

<p>Yes it is incomprehensible that the jury could miss it.  AND THIS FACT DEMONSTRATES JUST HOW CROOKED THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM REALLY IS.</p>
<p>Those of you who have not been wrongly prosecuted, either criminally or civilly, are living and operating in a world so far from reality that, with respect to matter of the courts, you are a retarded child.  </p>
<p>Nothing, absolutely nothing, except your own false imprisonment of bankrupting monetary judgment could ever convince you just how hopeless the court system really is.  The crooked legal system is the primary weapon used against the American Kulaks.  The results over time are the same as those achieved in the former soviet block. Just look at this dead girl.</p>
<p>When the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyer/prosecuting attorney colludes with the defendant&rsquo;s lawyer&hellip; and does his final statement before the jury, called voir dare or something like that, which has him channeling Satan &hellip; the jury of unemployed unemployables does exactly what they are told.</p>
<p>To say the jury is stupid is an understatement.  <br>
The trial reinforces their stupidity.<br>
The closing statement insures they do the politically correct thing.</p>
<p>Most people are too busy to observe a jury trial for purposes of edification and will go on with their lives of fantasy, baiting the trap for the day they slip.</p>

		<p>Poster #4 says &#8220;<i>But I think it&rsquo;s very significant that the Toronto Sun published no picture of Hindessa. And, except for the phrase &ldquo;jealous refugee&rdquo; in the first paragraph, and the allegation deep in the story that the murderer &ldquo;suffered torture in Ethiopia,&hellip;&hellip;..</i>&rdquo; </p>
<p>The &#8220;Toronto Sun&#8221; (not the Toronto Star) was considered to be the city&rsquo;s conservative newspaper at another time and had no qualms of addressing the hard issues related to immigrants and race. It now appears that newspaper has moved to left of center and crawled into bed with that other leftist newspaper. </p>
<p>The unproven claim that this Ethiopian &#8220;suffered torture&#8221; in his home country seems a rather shallow statement compared to his own <i>proven</i> brutality in a court of law. I suppose we&rsquo;re expected to feel some sympathy for the convicted murderer with that disclaimer. </p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Novak&rsquo;s parents, Ed and Dawn, applauded the judge for sending a strong message that violence against women is being taken seriously.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>If this young woman were my own daughter who was slaughtered, I would have started by condemning our broken &#8220;refugee&#8221; program, then I&rsquo;d verbally attack the government for allowing this Ethiopian into the country, then demand a return of the death penalty and end with denouncing the 2nd murder charge by calling for an appeal. </p>

		<p>Very few leftists are reading this but I can read the minds of those who are:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s easy to cite examples of blacks murdering their white wives/girlfriends.  But most white victims of domestic violence suffer at the hands of WHITE MEN&#8221;.  Furthermore, you don&rsquo;t bother to mention the black women who are beaten, or killed, by their white husbands/boyfriends.&#8221;</p>
<p>There!  I&rsquo;ve written the standard leftist response - since they are to lazy/cowardly to write it themselves.  Or perhaps they know, deep down, that such a retort is not even worth the pixels it is written in.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my retort to those leftists:</p>
<p>Of course most domestic violence is intra-racial as opposed to inter-racial.  This is because the vast majority of people still couple with their own race.  Hey, guess what?  The vast majority of murders do not involve angel dust.  Does this mean angel dust is perfectly safe and that it does not increase the risk of murder?  In other words, the leftist &#8220;intra-racial&#8221; retort is meaningless.  The risk remains much higher to date a black man than to date a white man.</p>
<p>As for cases where white men victimize black women - those are so rare as to be statistically insignificant.  They rarely occur.  When they DO occur, there is usually wide media coverage of it since this would fit their world view very nicely.</p>

		<p>Once a woman soils herself like this one did, she may as well be dead anyway.  She&rsquo;s no better than a prostitute.  The White world is spared her existence for the next 60 years.  Everyone nowadays is given all the rope they want, and a whole lot of people are hanging themselves.  It&rsquo;s ugly to watch, but there it is.  </p>

		<p>Natalie Novak attended Ryerson. She was in a left wing, multicultural campus that would have made her a star for dating a trophy black boy. </p>
<p>I think she was a little too old for this type of rebellion, but the Utopian left is the place for not growing up to reality. </p>
<p>White girls with low self-esteem, encouraged by pop culture, think being in an interracial relationship is the easy route to status among their peers.  </p>
<p>They go in blind to danger, because race awareness has never been taught to them.</p>

		<p>She appears to be an overweight White girl who couldn&rsquo;t attract a White man.  A 20 year old girl has to be thoroughly brainwashed to date a 33 year old Ethiopian, but yet we&rsquo;re seeing this sort of thing more and more.  For example, if you live in New York City and you walk the streets it is literally impossible to go even ONE DAY without seeing many White girls and women with men of other races.  It&rsquo;s disgusting.  The media instructs and they follow.</p>

		<p>As a Canadian I can tell you that the justice system here is a complete sham.</p>

<p>The parents are fools for their ridiculous statements.  Clearly they have been successfully brainwashed.</p>
<p>This African should be given the death penalty like many others before him.</p>
<p>Until the families of judges, lawyers and politicians start to feel some pain nothing will change.</p>

		<p>Sad sorrowful and disgusting but what is a white woman doing with a black? What is she doing with a married man? These are dividends of diseased/emotional ideas of equality of different cultures and races. The horrid visual/mental experience a healthy white mind goes through in seeing a pretty white woman willingly going with a black is on par with this ending. Of course there are dignified black men and barbarous white men but Africa is not Europe for reasons deeper than skin and physiogonomy. *(Our morality delivers us to our destiny)*</p>

		<p>I think it was O.J.&rsquo;s ex-wife&rsquo;s sister who gave some insight into the nature of the black male/white female relationship. She said a black(I don&rsquo;t know who) told her that a white woman in this type of relationship needed to be prepared to get the knife. I think this meant that the white woman should know that more than likely, one day she was going to get stabbed pretty bad.</p>

		<p>   I was sitting in a small restaurant here in southwest Ohio last night, and looked up to see a very pretty young white girl walking in with a very unkempt black boy,, wait can I call him a boy? Anyway, I gave them both a dirty look and they knew I didn&rsquo;t care for their pairing. The girl muttered something about the old racist staring at them. At that point, I smiled at her. If I was her father, she would be in alot of trouble.</p>

<p>    I&rsquo;ve learned, that whenever is see a black male/white female couple in public, is to do the complete opposite; i act as if they aren&rsquo;nt even there. That kills them (especially the black.) Bascially the black man is using the white woman to bring attention to himself because he wants to be noticed (And for other reasons of course.) </p>

<p>Not nearly as much trouble as she&rsquo;s fixin&rsquo; to be in if she stays in her current &#8220;relationship.&#8221; I wonder if it&rsquo;s just to diss her parents? After she&rsquo;s singlehandedly bringing up several little mulattoes out of wedlock, or winds up in ER or the women&rsquo;s shelter, she may curse the day she disregarded that stare of yours.</p>

<p>&#8220;She appears to be an overweight White girl who couldn&rsquo;t attract a White man. A 20 year old girl has to be thoroughly brainwashed to date a 33 year old Ethiopian, but yet we&rsquo;re seeing this sort of thing more and more. For example, if you live in New York City and you walk the streets it is literally impossible to go even ONE DAY without seeing many White girls and women with men of other races. It&rsquo;s disgusting. The media instructs and they follow.&#8221;</p>
<p> &gt; Well, she doesn&rsquo;t appear to be overweight to me.  Her face exhibits hollowed cheeks, which is the sign of a thinner person.  The hurtful truth is that there are just as many really attractive White women dating Blacks as not-so-goodlooking ones.  But what you say about New York City is all too true.  There seems to be a system for bringing young White women to NCY for insemenation.  My cousin moved to Idaho after his daughter got raped by a Mexican in Colorado.  Then she got a softball scholarship that took her to NYC.  She came back pregnant and now my cousin is raising a Black grandchild.  </p>

		<p>Is it just me, or are they painting this as &#8220;yet another case of misogyny&#8221;?  Lefties are good for that  &mdash;  remember that 1993 Super Bowl fiasco where the feminists claimed that Super Bowl Sunday was the worst day of the year for domestic violence?  (Turns out it was a huge hoax and the NOW-types had egg on their faces.)</p>
<p>This is not so much as &#8220;yet another case of misogyny&#8221; as another case of cluelessness when it comes to race.  I personally think black men go after white women to build up their egos, like another piece of bling, and to have revenge on Da Man.  White women go along with it because they&rsquo;ve been brainwashed with the PC and multicultural nonsense, and a lot of times it&rsquo;s a form of rebellion.</p>
<p>No one had to tell me I should marry a white man&hellip;it&rsquo;s just something I always assumed.  My husband gets annoyed if he sees a black man checking me out, and I don&rsquo;t much care for that unwanted attention myself.  If it happens again, I&rsquo;ll be sure to give my husband a squeeze to send out a message:  &#8220;Don&rsquo;t think so, homey!&#8221;</p>

<p>nyc,<br>
I suppose the FBI Unifrom Crime Statistics would support that, While it&rsquo;s true that some of the evidence is anecdotally based, it&rsquo;s statisically true that Blacks seem to go off without thinking things out. There are numerous cases of White people being physically assaulted for accidentally bumping into one of them on the street and in many cases even when they&rsquo;ve apologized. They shoot someone who scuffs their new sneakers.</p>
<p>As a high school teacher I&rsquo;ve seen numerous fights erupt over a glance. White people try not to make eye contact with Blacks in public because that might trigger an attack. A friend of mine who was a psychiatric nurse told me that there were advised to avoid direct eye contact with psychotics while walking through the wards because by doing so one &#8220;enters their world&#8221;. I truly believe that many Blacks suffer from psychosis.<br>
WE most definitely belong in separate places.</p>

		<p>i just read a book about how racial discrimination against blacks causes them to commit crimes.  Actually, according to the book, they don&rsquo;t really commit the crimes, it is just racial profiling and discrimination that gets them imprisoned.</p>
<p>But amongst all the liberal propaganda, was an interesting item.  It seems that during slavery days, rape of black women and underage girl slaves by their fellow black male slaves and black freedmen was so prevalent that most of the southern states were compelled to enact laws against black or mullato men raping slave girls under 12 as rape of a child with severe penalties and rape of slave girls under 16.</p>
<p>Interesting. I guess it was not always evil old massa who was raping the slave girls.</p>

		<p>She is from my school.  For some reason, it is not the first time when a student from Ryerson either committed a murder or was a victim of a murder in recent years.</p>
<p>In the past, two men from my school went racing at night and ran into an accident and killed a Pakistani cab driver.  And the two men ended up not having to spend a minute in jail.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/nt975c" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/nt975c</a></p>
<p>Of course, there were a lot of students from Ryerson who felt the decision by the judge wasn&rsquo;t right.  </p>
<p>As for the girl, I agree, I can&rsquo;t imagine any reason why a twenty year old woman would date a thirty three year old man, let alone a man who looks like him.  There are enough fine young men of her age in Toronto to choose from.  </p>
<p>in another note&hellip;. almost done with my undergraduate.  </p>
<p>I met world-class professors from Ryerson, I met world-class professors from U of T and York University, I had chances to learn from a few extremely talented TAs!  </p>
