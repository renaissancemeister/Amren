			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mitch Moxley, Time, July 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, &#8220;Shoot the Chinese&#8221; is spray-painted on a brick wall near a movie theater. A pair of swastikas and the words &#8220;Killer Boys .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! Danger!&#8221; can be read on a fence in an outlying neighborhood of yurt dwellings. Graffiti like this, which can be found all over the city, is the work of Mongolia&rsquo;s neo-Nazis, an admittedly implausible but often intimidating, and occasionally violent, movement.</p>
<p>Ulan Bator is home to three ultra-nationalist groups claiming a combined membership of several thousand  &mdash;  a not insignificant number in a country of just 3 million people. They have adopted Nazi paraphernalia and dogma, and are vehemently anti-Chinese. One group, Blue Mongolia, has admitted to shaving the heads of local women found sleeping with Chinese men. Its leader was convicted last year of murdering his daughter&rsquo;s Mongolian boyfriend, who had merely studied in China. {snip}</p>
<p>The neo-Nazis may be on society&rsquo;s fringe, but they represent the extreme of a very real current of nationalism. {snip}</p>
<p>Fifty-year-old Zagas Erdenebileg is the leader of Dayar Mongol (All Mongolia), the most prominent of the neo-Nazi groups. &#8220;If our blood mixes with foreigners&rsquo;, we&rsquo;ll be destroyed immediately,&#8221; says Erdenebileg, who has run unsuccessfully for parliament four times. {snip}</p>
<p>If Erdenebileg is the elder statesman of Mongolia&rsquo;s neo-Nazis, Shari Mungun-Erdene, the 23-year-old leader of the roughly 200-strong Mongolian National Union (MNU), is the new kid on the block and sports a swastika tattoo on his chest. The MNU takes vigilante action against law-breaking outsiders, Mungun-Erdene says, mainly Chinese. When I ask what kind of action, he replies, &#8220;Whatever it takes so that they don&rsquo;t live here. {snip}</p>
<p>Dagva Enkhtsetseg, program manager for the Open Society Forum, an Ulan Bator  &mdash;  based organization that promotes public participation in civic life, points out that the neo-Nazis don&rsquo;t enjoy broad support. A graduate in Mongolian nationalism, she argues that hard-line nationalism&rsquo;s allure is subsiding as more young Mongolians are exposed to globalization or study abroad. {snip}</p>

		<p>Mongols are serious about preserving their typical phenotypes and genes. I have heard people from Outer Mongolia or the nation of Mongolia calling the Mongols from Inner Mongolia or Mongolia inside china mix breeds as they had mixed with the Chinese and lost some typical Mongol traits. Even the racially similar Chinese!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;If our blood mixes with foreigners&rsquo;, we&rsquo;ll be destroyed immediately,&rdquo;.  Boy, did he ever get that right!  Anyway let&rsquo;s see&hellip; a nation of 3 million sitting next door to a heavily armed, and belligerent nation of 1.5 Billion.  Does the drop of wine have anything to fear from the ocean when it&rsquo;s on the beach near the waves?  It&rsquo;s too bad more people don&rsquo;t have the sense these &#8220;nazis&#8221; do, when it comes to self-preservation.  By the way, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like they&rsquo;re true Nazis, swastikas and all.  Seems like they just picked up a symbolism that relates to ethnic survival.</p>

He loathes the Chinese  &mdash;  whom he accuses of involvement in prostitution and drug-trafficking  &mdash;  and reveres Genghis Khan, who he says influenced Adolf Hitler. I ask him if he considers his adoption of the beliefs of a regime that singled out and executed people with Mongol features from among Soviet prisoners of war to be in any way ironic. &#8216;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rsquo; he shrugs. &#8216;We share the same policies.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

		<p>I wish they had made a shot of the swastika they&rsquo;re so excited about. Buddhist sects use a reverse swastika called a sonnenreich(sun wheel.) It can frequently be seen on necklaces, pendants, and rings. At least that was my impression while in S. Korea.</p>
<p>Hitler did take the sonnenreich, reverse it, and used it for the Nazi party.</p>
<p>Considering how an inverted cross is symbolic of the Anti-Christ.<br>
Could Hitler be called the anti-Buddha?</p>

<p>Actually, according to Lynn&rsquo;s &#8220;IQ and Global Inequality,&#8221; the average estimated IQ of Mongolia is 101, which is the same as Iceland and Switzerland, and higher than every other European country aside from Italy.  So it&rsquo;s probably not accurate to refer to them as &#8220;low IQ.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Interesting article. My guess, and it is a pure guess, would be they are taking their lead from some of the equally ridiculous, though very dangerous, Russian neo-Nazis.</p>
<p><i>Doesn&rsquo;t China also claim Mongolia, like Tibet, as among those &ldquo;territories&rdquo; that are, or should be, historically part of Greater China? I believe so.</i></p>
<p>The Peoples Republic of China has no claim to Mongolia. In fact Mongolians were socialist brothers, along with the Russians - at least until around 1959/60.</p>
<p>It is in fact the so called Republic of China (Taiwan) who still claims Mongolia as part of China - and indeed Mongolia is shown as a part of China on ROC maps.</p>
<p><i>Add to that, China&rsquo;s bitter hatred against the Mongols to this day (for the Mongol conquest), and the Mongolians have good reason to worry!</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think for a moment Chinese hate Mongols. The Mongol conquests were a very long time ago. Chinese have no more hate for Mongols, than the average Englishman would have of Vikings.</p>
<p>In fact the Chinese, including Mao, claim Genghis Khan as more or less one of ours. But then so do a whole lot of other countries.</p>
<p>Personally I am proud of Genghis, an Asian - the greatest conqueror the world has ever seen. Somehow though, I don&rsquo;t think my admiration of Genghis would count for much if I happened to run into some of these crazy Nazis.</p>
<p>But I suppose Chinese are a threat to Mongolia - not out of aggressive or malign intent - but simply because there are so much more of us than them. So our influence is probably just about unavoidable.</p>

<p>These people are not too stupid- as many an unfortunate Chinese, Persian, Arab, Russian, Pole, and Hungarian found out many centuries ago.</p>
<p>Michael Hart considers the Altaics (Northern Mongoloids) as one of history&rsquo;s most successful human groups:</p>
<p>&#8220;Three thousand years ago, less than 1 percent of the world&rsquo;s population spoke Altaic languages; and even today, less than 1.5 percent do&hellip;..In 1000 BC, the Altaic-speaking people were illiterate herdsmen inhabiting a sparsely-populated region north of China (see Map 39-1). By 1700 AD, their descendants ruled or occupied territories stretching from Algeria in the west to the shores of the Pacific Ocean in the Far East; and the three large Altaic-ruled empires contained a majority of the world&rsquo;s population!&#8221; <i>Understanding Human History, by Michael Hart</i></p>
<p><br>
Hart attributes their success to their high native intelligence - &#8220;this high intelligence manifested itself as a combination of very capable soldiers and extraordinarily able leadership.&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>Buddhist sects use a reverse swastika called a sonnenreich(sun wheel.)</i></p>
<p>Yes, reverse swastikas, often mistaken for swastikas, are common in China as well. They are usually posted on the doors or windows of restaurants to indicate to customers that the restaurant serves vegetarian food, which Buddhists customers prefer. </p>
<p>I find this article interesting, since my travels to China actually contributed to my interest in racial issues. When I realized that I could not condemn Mongolians if they bemoaned the (hypothetically) large number of Russians moving to their country, displacing their people and changing the ethnic makeup of the country, I could not condemn whites who had similar concerns about their own race. I did not know, until now, that (some) Mongolians felt that way about Chinese too. </p>
<p>By the way, when I was in China, I watched an excellent TV program that showcased talent from all over China. One of the contestants was a Mongolian band, who put on one of the most culturally enriching shows I have ever seen. It was not just music, it was an experience. A year later, I found this very same show uploaded to youtube. I think Amren readers will enjoy it:<br>

<p>Drs. Lynn and Vanhanen did address this issue, arguing that disparities between actual GDPs and those predicted by IQ could be the results of differences in natural resources and/or economic systems.  Of course a simpler answer might be that economic success is not entirely predicated by national IQ levels.  The example of North and South Korea, where the people are almost genetically identical, but the disparity in economic success is quite stark, is a good illustration of this fact.</p>
<p>Regardless, their studies of national IQ averages are pretty accurate, even if the economic numbers don&rsquo;t line up as one might expect.<br>

		<p>John Liu says that the Chinese have no animosity towards Mongolians - not quite true. The Chinese looked as though they were prepared to invade Mongolia in 1921, until the latter declared its independence on June 11, 1921 - with Soviet backing. Mongolia also supported the USSR during the Sino-Soviet rift of the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s. The Chinese may not have territorial designs on Mongolia now, but their memories are long.  </p>

<p>To tell the truth - I as a Chinese would love to welcome Mongolia back to the motherland. But I admire the Mongolian culture and would wish for it to maintain a high level of ethnic and cultural autonomy.</p>
<p>I doubt though the Russians would accept this - Mongolia is a buffer for them - this was certainly the case when they clashed with the Japanese in the 1930s.</p>

<p>I refuse to take part in this ridiculous belittling of Mongolians (this discussion in general), and quibble about their IQs, and whether they&rsquo;ve done anything great. Here we have a race of people with at least some portion of the population who wants to preserve their race and culture. So what if their IQs are significantly lower than whites, and so what if their IQs are significantly higher than whites. So what if they&rsquo;ve never accomplished anything that rivals what whites have accomplished (in anyone&rsquo;s opinion), and if they are not a significant player in the global power struggle. What matters is that they are a people who, like me, love their race, love their culture, and do not want to see it adulterated by outside influence. I say, &#8220;great!&#8221; With talented musicians like that, they <i>should</i> preserve their culture.  </p>

<p>I believe the &#8220;Nazism&#8221; being displayed is a move to repel intrusive Communist China, from their traditional Mongolian Nation, and its people, and customs, and it takes the outward form of a fortress, while inwardly, uniting the people behind them, under Nationalism.  </p>

___</p>
<p>If Michael Hart considers Ottoman Turks (from Algeria to Iran) as Altaic speaking and Northern Mongloid, he really needs to get a brain.</p>
<p>By the way, the dreadful Turks who were at the gates of Vienna and whose empire lasted 622 years, have an average IQ of 91 but those Mongols who didn&rsquo;t do anything else except fighting are smarter than Caucasoids and white Europeans. What a joke!</p>
<p>They were also not invincible, many times defeated by Mamluks, formed by Kipchak Turks in Egypt.</p>
<p>Turks and Mongols were and are different. Although their languages were related, they have never been racially related. This was even visible at that times when Turkic speaking tribes fought the Chinese. Their names were GokTurks because of their blue eyes.</p>

<p>Mongolians outscore Whites in IQ tests. You cannot built the world&rsquo;s second largest empire with low IQ.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire</a><br>
They had consistently defeated high IQ groups like Poles, Russians, Koreans and Chinese. Indeed even if I do not like this fact, European armies were nearly useless when facing the Mongols. The Mongols used archery and horses so effectively that they hardly had to come close to the European knights. The Europeans had only made a dent in the Islamic world during the Crusades, the Mongols conquered the centre of Islam itself. The Europeans foolishly gave up the change of creating a Mongol-European alliance (many Mongols were Christians) to crush Islam once and for all.</p>
<p>      The Germans who conquered Rome did not have much to show with respect to art and culture (compared to Rome atleast) but were they low IQ? The Vikings did not have opera singers but were brilliant designers of boats and ships. Higher IQ populations living in harsher conditions cannot build up the population to make civilizations supporting high art, high philosophy feasible. They had to concentrate on practical matters and in this Mongols, Goths and Vikings excelled.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as Genghis Khan is concerned, he surely was just an invader, rather than a conqueror. A real conqueror would be let&rsquo;s say Hernan Cortes. Note the whole Central and Southern America except Brazil speak Spanish.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you believe Genghis Khan and his descendants were not conquerors, you need a brain. They conquered China and the Chinese emperors for some centuries hence were of Mongol blood. They made Russia pay tribute. Their descendants conquered India to form the Mughal empire (Mughal = Mongol in Persian). </p>
<p>&#8220;They were also not invincible, many times defeated by Mamluks, formed by Kipchak Turks in Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody is invincible, even the British redcoats lost battles to lower IQ groups like the Marathas in India or the Zulus in Africa. </p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, the dreadful Turks who were at the gates of Vienna and whose empire lasted 622 years, have an average IQ of 91 but those Mongols who didn&rsquo;t do anything else except fighting are smarter than Caucasoids and white Europeans. What a joke!&#8221;</p>
<p>Turkey was a multiracial empire where the descendants of the Central Asian Turks made up the elites. Intermarriage with Turkish women and other European women means that their features became European. The same thing happened with the Mughals of India. Babar the first Mughal looked Mongol but his descendants married Indian princesses and ended up looking Indian. What you call today&rsquo;s Turkey has a lot of European and Middle-Eastern genes floating in here. The elites are all high IQ European looking while the masses especially in the South and East have loads of middle-Eastern ancestry depressing their IQs. The Mongols who stayed behind in Mongolia did not intermix with lower IQ groups in the South.</p>

<p>&#8220;With talented musicians like that, they should preserve their culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you say so, dude. I hated that music. Even more than I hate a lot of Western classical music, and that&rsquo;s going some.</p>
<p>Musical taste is very personal, and almost inexplicable. But I totally share your admiration for the Mongolians&rsquo; desire to preserve their race and culture. Including their music, of course.</p>
<p>(But, as the old joke goes, some of us feel our personal musical tastes are broad enough if we like both country AND western. That&rsquo;s me.)</p>

		<p>William Cutting, while nobody disputes that modern Turks are indistinguishable from any number of Caucasoid peoples, there is no denying their Mongoloid origins.  Kazakhstan is a Turkic-speaking nation, and most of their people look like you would expect from the geography - Mongoloid/Caucasoid hybrids.  Add to that the fact that there are pockets of Turkic-speaking peoples as far-ranging as Northeastern Siberia (who look 100% Mongoloid).  Turkic is also of the same language family as the Mongol and Tungusic (Manchu) groups, and those people are mostly Mongolid in appearance.  </p>
<p>Of course, you can&rsquo;t discount Caucasoid admixture even in predominately Mongoloid countries.  During the hayday of the Mongol Empire, many Caucasoids might have migrated to the Mongol heartland (forcefully or otherwise).  In fact, I&rsquo;d argue that the Koreans are racially the &#8220;purest&#8221; of the Mongoloids; moreso than the Mongols themselves.  Linguists are divided as to whether Korean and Japanese are part of the Altaic language family, or are language isolates.</p>
