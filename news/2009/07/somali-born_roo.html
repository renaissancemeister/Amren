<h1>Somali-Born Roosevelt Grad Pleads Guilty to Terror Acts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Carter and Ian Ith, Seattle Times, July 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Seattle man has pleaded guilty in Minnesota to terrorism-related charges in connection with the disappearances of dozens of U.S. Somali youths, some of whom turned up fighting with suspected terrorists in Somalia and at least one of whom became a suicide bomber, according to court documents and interviews.</p>
<p>Court records show Abdifatah Yusuf Isse, 25, a 2002 Roosevelt High School graduate and a former economics student at Eastern Washington University, traveled to Somalia to train with Al-Shabaab, a Somalia-based radical Islamist group that last year was designated by the U.S. State Department as a foreign terrorist organization.</p>
<p>His court-appointed attorney said Isse was likely being recruited as a possible suicide bomber.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty to a single count of providing material support to terrorists  &mdash;  which carries a possible 10-year prison sentence  &mdash;  and has been cooperating with federal investigators in what the FBI has said in an ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Omar Jamal, the director of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis, also has spoken with Isse&rsquo;s family and said Isse was approached by jihad recruiters at the Abubakar as-Saddique mosque, the largest Somali mosque in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people came here and took these boys right under the noses of the FBI,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Investigators say as many as 20 young Somali men from the Twin Cities area have disappeared in the past two years, and at least three of them have turned up dead in Somalia. They include Shirwa Ahmed, an American who blew himself up in a suicide bombing against U.N. and Ethiopian forces last October.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paul Engh, Isse&rsquo;s Minneapolis attorney, wrote in documents that Isse &#8220;will not be the last defendant indicted&#8221; because of the recruitment done by those he trusted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Records show Isse enrolled at Eastern Washington University, a 10,000-student campus at Cheney, near Spokane, in January 2003. He stayed there four years and majored in economics, until he left in December 2007 without earning a degree.</p>
<p>Eastern&rsquo;s student body is about 20 percent nonwhite, including a lot of foreign-born students. And Isse wasn&rsquo;t any different from any other college kid his age, recalled Grant Forsyth, an associate professor of economics who served as Isse&rsquo;s academic adviser. His professors and peers knew him as &#8220;Abdi,&#8221; and said he socialized easily with both foreign- and native-born students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Isse was a nice young man who expressed an interest in graduate school and aspired to work for the United Nations or the World Bank, Forsyth said. Like many undergraduate students, Isse had to be reminded to show up to class more often, Forsyth said. And as he progressed in the economics department, he struggled with the upper-level classes.</p>

<p>Sorry, wrong answer.  It&rsquo;s not that Isse wanted to work for the UN in spite of his terrorism, it&rsquo;s that he wanted to work for the UN because of his terrorism.  The UN, outside of any Muslim terrorist cabal, might as well be the world&rsquo;s biggest supporter of the Jihad.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the big fuss?  I mean just because terorist camps and jihadists are working dilligently to undermine this country doesn&rsquo;t mean we should concentrate on them and take away the small army of investigators who are watching the real terrorists:  The Tea Party bunch.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe me, just ask the ADL or the SPLC.  They&rsquo;re working overtime on a guy, his dog, and his computer, to make sure he doesn&rsquo;t get out of hand, because he was seen rubbing shoulders with a group of white guys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so comforting to know they put the important things first and foremost.</p>

		<p>Why are we letting Somali&rsquo;s in here by the truckload? So they can do this? Is it because Somali&rsquo;s reacted so badly to US troops in Somali, even the Marines had to leave? For all we know the entire Muslim world is fighting the West just so their kids have a chance to immigrate here. Defy the West seriously enough, and you can all move over here seems to be the message. It certainly is the reality. </p>

<p>Somalis are enthusiastically nationalist and tribal.  They find fulfillment in life by enriching their blood-related clan, at the expense of others.  </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the problem?  He&rsquo;s kind enough to limit his terrorism <i>to Somalia</i>.  I say (living in the Somali capital of America), if warlords want these kids back home, and they&rsquo;re willing to go, <i>we should subsidize recruiting stations</i> in American cities.</p>
<p>Note a couple other things here:  He&rsquo;s merely &#8220;a Seattle man&#8221;.  Like Bill Gates, Jimi Hendrix, Minoru Yamasaki.  Hey, why not?</p>
<p>And Roosevelt High was named for <i>Theodore</i>.  I wonder what he&rsquo;d think of all this!</p>

		<p>Oh, and note the guy&rsquo;s name:  Abdifatah Yusuf Isse.</p>
<p>Somalis don&rsquo;t have surnames; they use strict patronymics.  So he&rsquo;s Abdifatah, son of Joseph, grandson of Jesus.</p>
<p>How appropriate!</p>

		<p>It is not the Somali&rsquo;s that are your enemy.</p>
<p>It is the politicians that you elect that is the enemy.</p>
<p>Wake up to that fact and the Somali problem will go away.</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>These people should consider themselves lucky even to be here mopping floors or cleaning toilets.  (And they wouldn&rsquo;t be, if I had my say.)   What the devil is this person doing in college anyway?  This is considered college material?  And who is paying for it?   (Silly question!)</p>
<p>And he had to be &#8220;reminded to show up in class more often&#8221;!  Amazing.  But whether in the classroom or at work,  it reveals the general attitude and work ethic that the same types exhibit on the job, where they also have to be &#8220;reminded&#8221; to come to work more often.  As a manager myself, I have seen this and have had to contend with it personally.  And it&rsquo;s the same racial group, whether American-born or African.</p>
<p>Good grief!  When you have a job or are enrolled in school, you go there REGULARLY, and you go ON TIME.  That&rsquo;s what students or workers are supposed to do.   Do they need to be TOLD?   You don&rsquo;t drift in and out when you feel like it.  This is the Third World mentality.  Well, maybe it&rsquo;s just easier to  drop out and become a terrorist.  You can sleep late and  you don&rsquo;t have to get up  every morning.  You can also consider yourself superior to all the infidels around you   &mdash;    that&rsquo;s another nice benefit. And of course, Allah will reward you in a way that a diploma won&rsquo;t do.   </p>
<p>Is it any wonder their backward countries are all a mess?   Yet they blame us for having made them poor!   Without us greedy whites who&rsquo;ve been oppressing them and holding them down, they would all be kings and queens!</p>

		<p>With things like this, I find it so hard to believe the congress is attacking the CIA..Enen Panetta is getting down on the field agents who do all the dangerous work&hellip;I think the greatest, THE GREATEST security threat to America is our CONGRESS which is sacrificing our asecurity and safety for illegal immigrant, muslim and other non American approval votes. VOTEMOUT all of em on the mid term elections, federal,state, city, county and all.</p>

		<p>This is nothing but a tempest in a teapot. Wait till a few dozen million of Obama&rsquo;s African kinfolk start arriving. When the immigration taps are fully opened&hellip; by presidential order&hellip; for those poor political refugees fleeing persecution or whatever. Not only will we nasty, racist White taxpayers get to support those unwanted millions&hellip; just think how many terrorists or potential terrorists, not to mention garden-variety criminals and rapists will be among them.</p>
