<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34475335/ns/world_news-the_new_york_times/">Mexican Drug Traffickers Step Up Efforts to Corrupt Border Agents</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Randal C. Archibold, MSNBC, December 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At first, Luis F. Alarid seemed well on his way to becoming a customs agency success story. {snip}</p>
<p>But, early last year, after just a few months as a customs inspector, he was waving in trucks from Mexico carrying loads of marijuana and illegal immigrants. He pocketed some $200,000 in cash that paid for, as far as the government could tell, a $15,000 motorcycle, flat-screen televisions, a laptop computer and more.</p>
<p>Some investigators believe that Mr. Alarid, 32, who was paid off by a Mexican smuggling crew that included several members of his family, intended to work for smugglers all along. At one point, Mr. Alarid, who was sentenced to seven years in federal prison in February, told investigators that he had researched just how much prison time he might get for his crimes and believed, as investigators later reported, that he could do it &#8220;standing on his head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Alarid&rsquo;s case is not the only one that has law enforcement officials worried that Mexican traffickers  &mdash;  facing beefed-up security on the border that now includes miles of new fencing, floodlights, drones, motion sensors and cameras  &mdash;  have stepped up their efforts to corrupt the border police.</p>
<p>They research potential targets, anticorruption investigators said, exploiting the cross-border clans and relationships that define the region, offering money, sex, whatever it takes. But, with the border police in the midst of a hiring boom, law enforcement officers believe that traffickers are pulling out the stops, even soliciting some of their own operatives to apply for jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Infiltration</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a federal trial of a recently hired Border Patrol agent this year, one drug trafficker with ties to organized crime in Mexico described how he had enticed the agent, a close friend from high school in Del Rio, Tex., who was entering the training academy, to join his crew smuggling tons of marijuana into Texas.</p>
<p>The agent, Raquel Esquivel, 25, was sentenced to 15 years in prison last week for tipping smugglers on where border guards were and suggesting how they could avoid getting caught.</p>
<p>The smuggler, Diego Esquivel, who is not related to the agent, said he told her that her decision to enter the academy was a good career move and, he said, &#8220;I thought it was good for me, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the battle for survival among cartels in Mexico, in which thousands of people, mostly in the drug trade or fighting it, have been killed, has only led drug traffickers to redouble their efforts to get their drugs to market in the United States.</p>
<p><b>Exploiting ties</b></p>
<p>Along the border, many residents have family members on both sides. Generations of residents have been accustomed to passing back and forth relatively freely, often daily, and exchanging goods, legal or not.</p>
<p>Federal officials believe that drug traffickers are seeking to exploit those ties more than ever, urging family and friends on the American side to take advantage of the hiring rush for customs agents. The majority of agents and officers stay out of crime. But smuggling can be appealing. The average officer makes $70,000 a year, a sum that can be dwarfed by what smugglers pay to get just a few trucks full of drugs into the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In years past, new hires rarely served in the areas where they had grown up, but recently that practice has been relaxed somewhat to attract more recruits, said Thomas Frost, an assistant inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Frost and other internal affairs veterans say that has made it easier for traffickers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The F.B.I. is planning to add three multiagency corruption squads to the 10 already on the Southwest border, and the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s inspector general, the department&rsquo;s primary investigative arm, has also added agents. But such hiring has not kept up with the growth of the agency they are entrusted to keep watch over.</p>
<p>Over all, arrests of Customs and Border Protection agents and officers have increased 40 percent in the last few years, outpacing the 24 percent growth in the agency itself, according to the Department of Homeland Security inspector general&rsquo;s office. The office has 400 open investigations, each often spanning a few years or more.</p>
<p><b>National security threat</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most corrupt officers gravitate to smuggling illegal immigrants, rationalizing that is less onerous than getting involved with drugs, investigators say.</p>
<p>But Mr. Byers and others point to a string of drug-related cases that make them wonder if the conventional wisdom is holding.</p>
<p>Margarita Crispin, a former customs inspector in El Paso, pleaded guilty in April 2008 and received a 20-year prison sentence in what the F.B.I. considers one of the more egregious corruption cases.</p>
<p>Through a succession of boyfriends and other associates with ties to major drug trafficking organizations in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, Ms. Crispin helped smuggle thousands of pounds of marijuana over three years, almost from the time she began working for the agency.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Mother, daughter team</b></p>
<p>Just last month, Martha Garnica, a 12-year Customs and Border Protection employee near El Paso, was charged with bribery and marijuana smuggling in concert with traffickers in Ciudad Juárez.</p>
<p>Ms. Garnica&rsquo;s 21-year-old daughter had also sought a job with the Border Patrol, in what investigators deemed a suspicious move given her mother&rsquo;s alleged involvement in the drug trade. The daughter, testifying in court last week, admitted she had lied on the application both about being a United States citizen and about owning property in Mexico. A spokesman for the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office in El Paso declined to comment.</p>

		<p>I can scarcely recall the last time I saw a report of the Border Patrol on television wherein the agents weren&rsquo;t Hispanic. Yes, no wonder indeed!!</p>

		<p>Not expecting this sort of conduct is like expecting Detroit to suddenly become safe to walk in. The U.S. military is in a similar situation, far to many non citizen hispanics and far to many blacks of any nationality, we have Haitians, Puerto Ricans, Jamaicans, real Africans and everyone from South of the Border. Almost makes me think of Rome around 350AD.</p>

		<p>Seeing where the United States just gave Mexico multi-millon dollars in helecopters FREE, it should be much easier for these hard working criminals to transport their goods into America. I think anyone looking past the obvious will figure out there are elected official right here in America making a lot of money on the importation of drugs?</p>

		<p>Skip, you have to realize that all those you spoke of will have NO problem firing on US citizens if ordered to.  They have no ties to us, no identification with our culture, and are not white so probably hate whites into the bargain.  That&rsquo;s why our Government is recruiting these types so diligently and allowing them in the military with little or no real background investigation.</p>

		<p>I am always a little more cautious around a non-White cop.  I don&rsquo;t know if they might have an agenda not to my liking.  Many of them do.  </p>

		<p>The US Customs service is a top down brain dead agency run by hacks with low IQs and even lower motivation, except to suck up.</p>
<p>The article speaks mostly about Customs and Border Protection (CBP)Inspectors.  The Border Patrol (BP) is a part of CBP and it&rsquo;s true HH that about half of the BP agents are now Hispanic. </p>
<p>One reason for this is the BP&rsquo;s emphasis on knowing Spanish.  This is a canard of course used by management to boost Hispanic numbers. BP agents must know some Spanish but largely that of a survival nature as is taught to city cops in the southwest. </p>
<p>One BP agent told me that the only Spanish needed was, &#8220;de donde viene, a donde var.  I know you&rsquo;re lying, get in the car.&#8221;  Overdrawn of course, but the point was made.</p>
<p>The emphasis on Hispanic hiring puts the BP at risk of the same thing that the article discusses about CBP Inspectors.  In confidence a lot of white agents will confide that gangs recruit members clean enough to join the BP. Once in, they are expected to become moles for the gang.  How many does the BP have on its payroll now? And worse, how many moles does the BP have right now in senior management positions?</p>
<p>The article mentioned the Inspector General (IG) would perhaps conduct internal investigations of employees.  Best they investigate management first, but the IG in recent years has become a joke that can be bent to any political will.</p>
<p>The FBI? Let me get this straight. According to the article this is a mostly Hispanic problem because of their close ties to mother Mexico. So don&rsquo;t make me laugh.  The FBI involved in profiling?  Besides they&rsquo;re too busy looking for agents who may have called a Mexican alien a bad name during a legal arrest.  </p>

		<p>Poster #4 is quite correct.  When Tienamin square was going on in China, the Chinese bused in soldiers from far out in the countryside because they were more willing to fire on the people of Beijing than more locally established troops.  Also, when the Soviets first invaded Afghanistan, most of the first waves of soldiers were fellow central asians, and they were loath to fire on people like them.  After a year they were withdrawn and white soviet personnel were sent in as replacements.  Yes, Rome just before its collapse.  Most of the &#8216;Roman&rsquo; forces by that time were foreigners - mostly Germanic tribes hired to provide security.  Folks, we&rsquo;re in for a lot of trouble in 20 years or so.</p>

		<p>So let&rsquo;s see&hellip;  do your job, stop a drug dealer from coming over the border, get into shoot-out, shoot said dealer in rear, end up in prison thanks to your boss.</p>
<p>Or, make a 6 figure salary, and look the other way from time to time&hellip;</p>
<p>Not a hard one to figure out.</p>

		<p>Over the last 40 years, the United States has become a farce that has completely failed.</p>
<p>The government refuses to protect and secure the nation&rsquo;s borders. It refuses to enforce immigration laws. It refuses to find, apprehend, and deport illegal aliens en mass. </p>
<p>We live under a system that rewards irresponsible behavior and punishes responsible behavior. The same system bases rewards largely on skin color and ethnicity. Heterosexual Whites are punished for having ambition, responsibility, and the wherewithal to fairly compete and win based on personal merit and legitimately earned accomplishments. </p>
<p>Blacks, Browns, Muslims, homosexuals, and every other category of undesirables are given special rights that has nothing to do with merit.</p>
<p>The next shoe to drop will occur when the Arab world erects their new central bank and launches their own currency. The U.S. dollar will plummet and inflation will soar! If you think times are tight now, stand by! The U.S. has nothing to export. Nothing! The only things the U.S. is good at is (a) esposing political rhetoric around the world, (b) punishing desirable behavior, (c) reward undesirable behavior, and (d) serving as a doormat for all forms of miscreants and undesirables the world over.</p>
<p>This will all end very badly, my friends, and I don&rsquo;t think we have long to wait. It&rsquo;s going to become very ugly.</p>
