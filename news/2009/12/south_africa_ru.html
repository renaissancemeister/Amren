<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8406647.stm">South Africa &#8216;Rugby Unity&rsquo;: Fact and Fiction</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, December 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fourteen years ago Nelson Mandela used the 1995 Rugby World Cup to unite black and white South Africans. A film based on the historic event, Invictus, opens on Friday and has raised the question: Has the dream of transformation lived on?</p>
<p>Both the film and the book on which it is based  &mdash;  John Carlin&rsquo;s Playing the Enemy  &mdash;  have a fairytale ending, but this is not necessarily the case for South Africa today.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s racial tensions are a lot more subtle.</p>
<p>Most black and white South Africans have embraced each other&rsquo;s differences but every once in a while the country&rsquo;s apartheid past rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>When political leaders fail to agree, they often accuse each other of being racists.</p>
<p><b>Elusive dream</b></p>
<p>But jobs previously reserved for white people are now accessible to blacks. White and black South Africans can socialise without fear of victimisation.</p>
<p>There are no &#8220;whites only&#8221; or &#8220;blacks only&#8221; signs hanging in restaurants, on buses, on beaches or airports.</p>
<p>But a new study suggests that much work needs to be done to achieve the goal of a &#8220;rainbow nation&#8221;.</p>
<p>The study by the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation used a sample of 3,500 people.</p>
<p>According to the survey, 24% of South Africans said that they never spoke to people of other races on a typical day.</p>
<p>And 46% admitted to &#8220;never socialising&#8221; with people of other races in their own homes or friends&rsquo; homes.</p>
<p>Mr Mandela used rugby to preach transformation and reconciliation to South Africans  &mdash;  it was one of the first fruits of his &#8220;rainbow nation&#8221;.</p>
<p>But still rugby remains a predominantly white man&rsquo;s sport.</p>
<p>And equally football remains a predominately black sport.</p>
<p>So have South Africans forgotten Mr Mandela&rsquo;s message?</p>
<p><b>Work in progress</b></p>
<p>South African actress Marguerite Wheatley, who plays the wife of former national rugby captain Francois Pienaar (played by Matt Damon), was 14 years old when South Africa played New Zealand in the momentous final.</p>
<p>She says she was &#8220;oblivious&#8221; to apartheid South Africa and what the rugby match meant to the dream of a &#8220;new South Africa&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you knew that white is right and black is wrong, and then all of a sudden white is wrong and black is right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so it was very confusing for me as a teenager,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us young people it was easier to accept each other. I can&rsquo;t remember much about apartheid [but] I know that when apartheid fell, they were saying &#8216;Our country has gone to the dogs&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheatley says although South Africa was brought together &#8220;forcefully&#8221; most South Africans are looking at working together to continue building the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re figuring out, we&rsquo;re sorting it out,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Hollywood star Morgan Freeman, who has visited the country a number of times, says there is still &#8220;energy&#8221; in South Africa reminiscent of the 1995 World Cup victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made two visits here, one during the transition when it was so volatile and at Madiba&rsquo;s 80th birthday I came back and the place was absolutely electric with promise,&#8221; says Freeman.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t feel this electricity right now but you feel the energy, this feeling, sense of promise. You feel that there is still this sense of promise that now we can get moving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Film critics are already predicting that the movie will earn Freeman an Oscar.</p>
<p>The actor, who is also one of the film&rsquo;s executive producers, plays Mr Mandela  &mdash;  a role with the potential to catapult any actor&rsquo;s career to world acclaim.</p>
<p>Freeman says he was &#8220;blessed&#8221; to have access to Mr Mandela.</p>
<p>&#8220;I studied him; I had close access to him,&#8221; he says speaking about the man he describes &#8220;a friend&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only was I able to look at tapes and get mannerisms and the walk, I was able to sit and hold his hand and talk to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Freeman says one of the challenges of accurately portraying Mr Mandela was learning how to speak like him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody else sounds like him; it&rsquo;s a very distinctive voice, so I had to work on that,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p><b>Complaints</b></p>
<p>The film is directed by veteran actor Clint Eastwood and includes a local and international film crew.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, local actors&rsquo; unions have complained about Hollywood actors playing lead roles in films portraying South African icons and say South Africans should play more prominent roles in big productions.</p>
<p>But producers argue that using well-known names draws in crowds and goes a long way to ensuring the film&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>Invictus has a strong presence of local actors, although they are not playing lead roles.</p>
<p>The name of the film is derived from a poem by William Ernest Henley which Mr Mandela is said to have memorised during his years imprisoned on Robben Island.<br>

<p>Oh, really? Is that why 1 out of 4 white South Africans have emmigrated since the blacks took over? When a quarter of a group emmigrates to escape a hostile environment in which crime is very prevalent and hiring practices discriminate against whites in favor of lesser qualified blacks (the two top citations white South Africans give for emmigrating), it&rsquo;s undoubtedly an exodus.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to know more about the exodus of Boers from South Africa because of crime and anti-white discrimination, just do a google search for &#8220;white flight south africa.&#8221;</p>

		<p>That movie is multcultist trash.  It is typical Hollywood propaganda designed to brainwash people into thinking that  forcible integration is the miracle-producing solution to every problem.  No small coincidence that this film makes it to theaters as Obama&rsquo;s approval reaches it&rsquo;s lowest mark so far, and the once-mighty USA is now &#8220;going to the dogs&#8221; in it&rsquo;s own right.  One other thing.  Francois Pienaar is an over 6ft 3in hulk of a man.  Matt Damon is barely 5ft 10in.  LOL, I love every scene of Morgan Freeman having to bend lower slightly to be eye-level with him!  Hilarious!     </p>

		<p><em>Today&rsquo;s racial tensions are a lot more subtle.</em></p>
<p>Subtle? Really? An AmRen blogger listed a link to a YouYube video about the horrific white genocide that is occuring in South Africa. The video depicted the gory and mutilated corpses of white men and women. One such photograph showed the raped and bludgeoned corpse of a white woman with a broom stick protruding from her vagina. Of course YouTube removed this video within a few days, but has since replaced it.</p>
<p>Black on white racial violence in South Africa seems to me to be anything but subtle. I was so moved and shocked by this video that I am reading and viewing everything I can get my hands on about this heinous subject.</p>
<p>This video can now be seen on YouTube:</p>

		<p>How have whites and blacks embraced each other in the new South Africa, which is crumbling before our eyes, where crime rates are astronomical, where the economy is in free-fall, and wherewhite farmers are being slaughtered or driven from their land.</p>
<p>This movie will be as false a portrayal of the new South Africa, as the television series &#8220;Good Times&#8221; was about life in the Cabrini-Green housing projects in Chicago.  </p>

<p>The above statement can be made about ANY situation involving &#8220;Diversity.&#8221;  Wherever you try to force different people to live together, you will get stress and conflict.  It has been that way for 10,000 years, and it will be that way 10,000 years from now.  That is why Diversity is a great weakness.</p>

<p>How much work will it take to get leftist, airhead whites to understand that no non-black nation on earth could ever hope to have a harmonious society if blacks are included?</p>
<p>Only fools, imbeciles and idiots buy into the rainbow utopia scam.  One day, we just might be able to put them all together so they can enjoy all the &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In between white beatings and killings, I mean. It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a more deserving group.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s chasing a dream, a flight of delusional leftist fancy - it&rsquo;s something that will never be attained in the USA, in Tibet, in South Africa or any other place where &#8220;diversity&#8221; exists.</p>
<p>But in a way, it makes it the perfect moneymaking scam, as ultra -PC films are released, diversity managers are hired at corporations and candlelight vigils are held, all striving towards that problem whose solution is just always out of reach.</p>

According to box office numbers, Invictus has been a major disappointment and money loser for the studio. 60 million to produce and it earned 8 million.</p>
<p>Another mulitcult film that did badly this weekend was Blind Sided.</p>
<p>Hollywood keeps turning out multicult films that few people want to see. For an industry that&rsquo;s so driven by money, you&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d stop producing such films and yet they give us more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a disconnect somewhere. These studios seem to believe it&rsquo;s more important to promote the mulitcult than it is to make money.<br>

<p>And in the US, the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; always rears its ugly head. And in the rest of the world, the &#8220;legacy of colonialism&#8221; always rears its ugly head. Etc. Which means there&rsquo;s always a bogus explanation possible for every world problem.</p>
<p>If there had never been any colonialism, then the &#8220;legacy of isolationism&#8221; would have been blamed for South Africa&rsquo;s problems, except that there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any country known as South Africa to begin with.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Eastwood&hellip; a sad end to a career&#8221;-Anonymous<br>
One of my pre awakening moments came when watching his movie &#8220;White Hunter/Black Heart&#8221;. In it theres a scene where an attractive woman at dinner makes a disparaging remark about minorities and Eastwood`s character demeans her in the most vulgar  and violent terms. She is shocked and humiliated into silence. And I thought to myself, first I wouldn`t be putting off a beautiful woman,no matter how much I disagreed with her politics, I`d be agreeing with her and signaling for more drinks. Second I thought that there is no excuse for insulting a woman like that, and the movie made it seem as if it was a mandatory obligation on the part of every right thinking individual. And I thought, it can`t be right for a person to humiliate someone over something they said in private, with no ill affects to others. Kind of like killing someone who doesn`t demonstrate proper gun safety. The &#8216;cure&#8221; being so much worse than  the disease. It was really a template and permission to demean others for their percieved racism. Lastly, I quit being a fan when I ran into Eastwood on a Fifth Avenue sidewalk. I looked over and said to myself, &#8220;That`s Clint Eastwood!&#8221;  I wasn`t sure till the man shot me a look back with only his eyes saying, &#8220;Do NOT approach me!&#8221; And I thought, &#8220;What a jerk! I wasn`t going too and you don`t own the sidewalks of Manhattan mister&hellip;&#8221; Dirty Harry indeed!</p>

		<p>I agree with all of the negative statements here. I have worked with White South Afrikaneers here in the Muddled East, and those that can have moved their families out of SA because of the danger. Through them, I was also introduced to a South African website www.zasucks.com and it is of and by South African Whites and FOR the world. I will bet it is one of the blocked sites on the U.S. military internet systems, will try to remember to check tomorrow and let all know.</p>

		<p>It is a fact that South Africans (especially whites) are worse off now than they were under apartheid.  But you&rsquo;ll never hear anybody admit this.  Clint Eastwood can make all the feel good movies he wants, it doesn&rsquo;t change the facts.</p>

		<p>Been reading a lot of online comments and it seems to be that the jig is up and the audience is tired&hellip; &#8220;The Frog Princess Writ Large&#8221; reads one. Many others compare it unfavorably to Gran Torino meaning that they saw through the message and now hate the messenger (Eastwood) also. Seem to be running about 4 to 1 negative to positive. Many were asking why entertqinment now has to have a &#8220;message&rsquo;?!?</p>

Well, if you know of any real white women in their late 20s/early 30s with this kind of attitude, please send them in my direction so we can get married and have tons of white children.</p>

		<p>Richard (#3), the video I was linked to turned my stomach, especially some of the later pictures. Perhaps you should promote viewership of this video elsewhere, not just at AmRen and similar sites. With any luck, it will prompt real action, provided that Queen Oprah, Danny Glover, et al, will climb down off their high horses. </p>

<p>Really? Define the terms &#8220;socialize&#8221; and &#8220;victimization.&#8221; Seems to me anywhere in the world, if whites associate with blacks too much they are indeed inviting eventual victimization.</p>
<p>I wonder what the white folks in Richard&rsquo;s now infamous SA crime scene video on YouTube would say about that statement. I saw that a while back. I&rsquo;ve seen some horribly mangled corpses in traffic collisions during my decade plus driving trucks. I&rsquo;ve got a really strong stomach and do not nauseate easily. But that vid was enough to make me quite literally sick. I can&rsquo;t watch it again.</p>

		<p>Mandela is nothing but a terrorist and for Eastwood to praise him as if he was some sort of savior of South Africa is a level which I never thought he would stoop to. I&rsquo;m very disappointed in the decision he&rsquo;s made in his twilight years and please, don&rsquo;t get me started on those left-wing nose pickers Damon and Freeman.

&#8220;Eastwood is displaying his true colors as a typical Hollywood liberal. A sad end to a career.&#8221;<br>

<p>Since he married his new, much younger, multi-racial wife, it seems he has become pro-miscegenation. I suspect that has a lot to do with it.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, he never claimed to be either conservative or liberal, just middle of the road or politically indifferent,  a &#8220;political  nobody&#8221; in his own words.   Now, maybe that has changed, since his youngest daughter is herself multi-racial. Looks that way.</p>

<p>Thanks for the site  &mdash;  the You Tube video has indeed been pulled.</p>
<p>As for sasucks.com  &mdash;  the moderator who went by the name &#8216;Uhuru Guru&rsquo; was ARRESTED in SA and &#8216;disappeared&rsquo; the site out of fear for his family.  He had a final comments blog up for a short time but that too has been pulled.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Uhuru Guru was arrested this morning at around 06h30 on trumped up charges regarding an alleged offence dating back to 1993. His door was ripped off, his wife was not allowed to make calls, his children&rsquo;s cell phones were confiscated, his little daughters were were ripped out of their beds, you cannot believe the cruelty</p>
<p>A massive contingent of police from no less than five different specialist units, ranging from Organised Crime, Cyber crime, vehicle theft, etc; raided his home and confiscated all his computer equipment.</p>
<p>This arrest is motivated ultimately by the State. No doubt it has to do with zasucks&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Will it happen here to us as well?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>Mandela was a murdering terrorist and not the Christ like figure that they would have us believe. THere is a You Tube clip showing him singing with a group.  The theme of the &#8220;song&#8221; was the killing of Whites.</p>
<p>Praising this guy as a hero would be the equivalent of lauding the few virtues of Hitler. Hey, he loved dogs and he spared Dr. Bloch the fate of 6,000,000 others.<br>
