<h1>Immigration Activists Seek Quicker Access to Medicaid</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Rufus Koren, San Bernardino Sun, December 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrants rights groups are seeking to change federal law so that legal immigrants won&rsquo;t have to wait five years before becoming eligible for Medicaid.</p>
<p>Critics say such a change could make the U.S. a magnet for infirm immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Isabel Alegria, a spokeswoman for the California Immigrant Policy Center, said there&rsquo;s no good rationale for leaving legal immigrants without Medicaid, a federally funded program that is administered by individual states.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are lawful residents who pay into the system and should be able to take advantage of it if they come into hard times,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The American taxpayer should not be burdened with other countries&rsquo; medical problems,&#8221; he [Raymond Herrera, a local opponent of illegal immigration] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Joe Baca, D-San Bernardino, who has been a strong proponent of immigration reform, said he doesn&rsquo;t want to remove the five-year waiting period.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s the price people pay to become legal citizens,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Redlands, who voted against the House version of the healthcare bill and likely won&rsquo;t vote for whatever comes out of the conference committee, seemed open to the idea of removing the waiting period.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not supportive of putting restrictions on people who are here legally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The law ought to apply to all people who are citizens and who are here legally.&#8221;<br>

		<p>One of the reasons they are seeking this is hospitals are starting to fight back against medical theft.</p>
<p>In the past, illegals simply showed up at a hospital, ran up a huge bill, left a phony name and address (or a real one and just ignored the bill).  The law says you have to treat them if they have insurance or not, can pay or not.  But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t have to pay&hellip;.afterward.</p>
<p>Now hospitals are asking these patients to pay as they leave.  None of them are paying, of course&hellip;but being confronted about it makes them uncomfortable, and less likely to come back.  Many still fear police involvement.  In fact, most are wanted criminals and are terrified if the cops are called, they will be pinched for something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before stronger measures are put in place to keep them from stealing healthcare.</p>
<p>So called &#8220;immigrant rights&#8221; groups are attempting to pro-actively stop that.  They know that medical care theft is one of the main reasons people come to the US at all.  Remove access to that and a great many will leave.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much in the way of problems the US has that couldn&rsquo;t be quickly solved by eliminating welfare of all types to anyone who isn&rsquo;t physically capable of moving enough to do some type of work.  Old folks and bed ridden handicapped ONLY.</p>

		<p>In case y&rsquo;all hadn&rsquo;t heard, CA is bankrupt - so I don&rsquo;t think we can AFFORD to change any law to give welfare to immigrants, be they legal or illegal.  It&rsquo;s a simple matter of financial practicality.  Perhaps when the state is solvent again, we can consider it for LEGAL immigrants - but not now.  We simply cannot handle any more financial expenses.</p>

<p>This kind of ignorance about what this country can and cannot support financially will remain until the country becomes bankrupt in 2010 or shortly thereafter.  When it becomes apparent the nation, like California, is unable to pay for freebies like this the invaders will riot and declare themselves victims of racism.</p>
<p>California and up to 24 more states will be in the process of bankruptcy before it becomes apparent the US is helpless to save them, because it will be unable to save itself.</p>
<p>Much angst is in store for this multicultural paradise, coming soon to a neighborhood near you.<br>

		<p>The people who bring us economic prosperity.  The people for whom we owe so much because of their invaluable contribution to our economic security need Medicaid?  Impossible, immigrants give far more than they take.<br>

<p>I can think of one Isabel - you haven&rsquo;t payed in to it so why should you be able to use it. After five years of paying in, THEN you&rsquo;ve earned it. </p>

		<p>Skip the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;..The government seems to have forgotten, or never knew, that HOSPITALS are BUSINESSES and businesses need to earn money or they FAIL! Failure and closing before the bottom line deteriorates much will be the result of this pandering to illegals and FORCING the Hospitals/businesses to provide FREE work&hellip;NO business can survive that except &#8220;minority&#8221; subsidized fake businesses. Therefore, SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;. total general hospital failures and closings late in 2010..</p>

		<p>People throw around the word bankrupt pretty loosely without really understanding.</p>
<p>The federal government and most of the state governments are ALREADY bankrupt.  They&rsquo;ve been giving freebies out to non-whites, especially immigrants on CREDIT.</p>
<p>Now the credit has run out.  The scam that Obama is running now is an attempt to convince whites to simply hand over the majority of the wealth in this country to him so that it can be given away to non-whites.</p>
<p>The ISSUE is if whites will do it.  He can&rsquo;t force us to do it.  All we have to do to stop this is put up our hands and refuse.  Allow our governments to fall apart and dissolve.  Default on the &#8220;national debt&#8221; to make sure no country ever gives our country credit again.</p>
<p>Will whites do it?  Certainly the &#8220;tea party movement&#8221; is a healthy sign.  But the issue is still very much in doubt.</p>
<p>We are bankrupt as a nation and have been for some time.  We need to liquidate our governments and start over.  Make no mistake, one way or another it WILL happen.  But will we lose everything in the process?  It depends on exactly how weak and stupid white people have become.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Immigrants rights&#8221; is just another term for those who feel &#8220;illegals should have the same rights as citizens&#8221;. Well, no they don&rsquo;t, they have no right to be here period and they certainly have no right to medicaid. &#8220;Immigration reform&#8221; is simple, start enforcing our immigration laws and stop allowing illegals to stay in the country.</p>

		<p>Illegal immigration costs California $9 billion a year.  If there was no illegal immigration CA would not have any budget problems.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something you can do.  The 15th of every month is White Defense Day.  On that day do something to build up whites or oppose anti-white racism.  The idea is to get whites acting together at the same time.  Talk about illegal immigration on that day.</p>
<p>Also, wear something white on the 15th of every month to show solidarity with other whites.</p>

		<p>We are inundated daily with the term &#8220;Obamacare&#8221;, but there is no mention of the term &#8220;Hillarycare&#8221; that preceded it.  Why? </p>
<p>Obama is the Clinton&rsquo;s sock puppet as evidenced by Hillary&rsquo;s incessant effort to commandeer our healthcare industry and the fact that most of Obama&rsquo;s cabinet is made up of Clinton administration retreads&hellip;</p>

		<p>Piling other nations problems onto the American Taxpayer is exactly what the &#8220;new world order&#8221;, that Bush Sr. talked about is. It is the raising out of &#8220;poverty&#8221; the third world, by taxing what is left of the American middle class into a state of poverty. That&rsquo;s what measure of progress is, the rate at which Americans are becoming poor. That&rsquo;s what the perpetually open borders, and the sixth or seventh AMNESTY, is all about. The U.S. taxpayer is Mexico&rsquo;s and other nations ATM machine.</p>

<p>People, please don&rsquo;t bore our government with silly white-people concepts like &#8216;bankruptcies&rsquo;, &#8216;bottom lines&rsquo;, &#8216;indebtedness&rsquo;, and especially, &#8216;budgets&rsquo;.  Africans know the TRUTH.  Money is a kind of white-man magic.  And now that they rule over the white man, the noble and all-knowing Africans can go to the place the white man used to go to get the money.  Now, without the stingy, White Devils in the way, the Africans can get all the money they need.</p>
<p>So, when Obama runs out of Trillions, he can go and get Quadrillions.  When those run out, some cringing White Devil will gratefully name the next order of monetary magnitude.<br>
