<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Margaret Thatcher thought it was &#8220;quite wrong&#8221; for immigrants to get council houses ahead of &#8220;white citizens&#8221;, previously unpublished government papers show.</p>
<p>Jon Swaine, Telegraph (London), December 30, 2009</p>
<p>Files released to the National Archives show that soon after becoming prime minister, Lady Thatcher privately complained that too many Asian immigrants were being allowed into Britain.</p>
<p>The documents, which are published today under the &#8220;30 year rule&#8221;, shed further light on Lady Thatcher&rsquo;s attitudes on race and immigration, political issues that have remained controversial ever since.</p>
<p>They show that in July 1979, Lady Thatcher met Lord Carrington, her foreign secretary, and William Whitelaw, then home secretary, to discuss the plight of hundreds of thousands of &#8220;boat people&#8221; fleeing persecution in communist Vietnam.</p>
<p>The prime minister, who had publicly said that she sympathised with fears that Britain was being &#8220;swamped&#8221; by immigrant cultures, reacted sharply to the ministers&rsquo; suggestions that thousands of the Vietnamese refugees should be welcomed.</p>
<p>Lord Carrington, who had visited refugee camps in Hong Kong where some of the boat people were being held, gave a &#8220;vivid account&#8221; of the conditions there, the minutes show.</p>
<p>He suggested that Britain take 10,000 of them over two years. Failure to take a significant number would lead to a &#8220;damaging reaction&#8221; at home and abroad, he said, and anything less than 10,000 would be &#8220;difficult to sustain&#8221; on the world stage.</p>
<p>But Lady Thatcher said that there were already too many people coming into Britain, according to the minutes.</p>
<p>She said that &#8220;with some exceptions there had been no humanitarian case for accepting 1.5 million immigrants from south Asia and elsewhere. It was essential to draw a line somewhere&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Whitelaw entered the debate, suggesting to the prime minister that refugees were a different matter to immigrants in general.</p>
<p>He said that according to letters he had received, opinion favoured the accepting of more of the Vietnamese refugees.</p>
<p>Lady Thatcher responded that &#8220;in her view all those who wrote letters in this sense should be invited to accept one into their homes,&#8221; the minutes disclose.</p>
<p>&#8220;She thought it quite wrong that immigrants should be given council housing whereas white citizens were not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Thatcher asked what the implications of such a move could be given that an exodus of the white population from Rhodesia  &mdash;  now Zimbabwe  &mdash;  was expected once majority rule was established.</p>
<p>She made clear, however, that she had &#8220;less objection to refugees such as Rhodesians, Poles and Hungarians, since they could more easily be assimilated into British society&#8221;.</p>
<p>The meeting was held about 18 months after Lady Thatcher made comments in a television interview that came to be seen as a watershed in mainstream politicians&rsquo; handling of race and immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture,&#8221; she told World In Action.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do not want people to go to extremes we ourselves must talk about this problem and we must show that we are prepared to deal with it,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We are not in politics to ignore people&rsquo;s worries. We are in politics to deal with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comments were held responsible for a collapse in support for the National Front, which had been gathering momentum in working class communities.<br>

		<p>The more I hear of Margaret Thatcher, the more I admire and respect the Iron Maiden. I am also ashamed to recall that I followed the rest of the impressionable sheep when I was young in condemnation of her conservative sensibility. She was condemned for her poll tax that impacted on the underclass, many of whom were migrants; for breaking the miners&rsquo; stranglehold on business, and staring them down during their programmed strikes; and for her support of measures to rebuild Britain&rsquo;s economy. And now it seems she was a secret sympathiser of Enoch Powell. It&rsquo;s sad she was forced out her Prime Ministry and replaced by the insipid John Major. </p>

		<p>It seems that the great &#8220;iron lady&#8221; and former prime minister was on to something. She was probably well aware of the self-serving, manipulative, and potentially latent deviousness of many Asians. She was not fooled by the so-called &#8220;model minority&#8221; nonsense that has been ascribed to Asians.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that many of our posters who seem to be so enthralled with Asians cannot seem to realize the truth. </p>

		<p>I interpret this the same way I interpret Richard Nixon&rsquo;s &#8220;racism.&#8221;  As the White House tapes show, he and Billy Graham loved to drop n-bombs and J-bombs on almost a minutely basis.  Yet, Nixon actually used his power as President to enact more affirmative action, more diversity and more equality.  And Billy Graham&rsquo;s ministry has been anything but pro-white.</p>
<p>While Margaret Thatcher liked to mouth a good game, she pursued pro-Muslim  open borders policy as Prime Minister.  </p>

		<p>Vietnam and England are roughly the same size, with over 80 million people each, but Vietnam is growing much faster.</p>
<p>In the late 1970&rsquo;s, Canada decided to accept some boat people.  Today, as evidenced by their frequent arrests, the Vietnamese communities have established themselves enthusiastically in the marijuana grow-op business.</p>

		<p>Lord Carrington&rsquo;s and William Whitelaw&rsquo;s positive reaction and rationale behind potentially admitting some Vietnamese boat people is enlightening for the reasons and worrying in the mentality of the establishment it reveals. Really disconnected from reality (and these guys are meant to be right wingers) but Maggie&rsquo;s comments seem more in touch with real people&rsquo;s opinions especially &ldquo;in her view all those who wrote letters in this sense should be invited to accept one into their homes&rdquo;, classic!</p>

		<p>Thatcher did nothing to stop mass non-white immigration to Britain.  She was a lying fraud who cynically mouthed anti-immigration rhetoric to undermine the genuine nationalists of the National Front in the election and then never mentioned immigration publicly again.  Only in America is there this cult around her as some kind of great leader.  She is extremely unpopular in Britain today.  The analogy with Nixon is a good one.  Who cares if these traitors made &#8220;racist&#8221; comments in private?  It&rsquo;s the policies they implemented that mattered.  </p>

		<p>from Gary-  &#8220;She was not fooled by the so-called &ldquo;model minority&rdquo; nonsense that has been ascribed to Asians.</p>
<p>It bears pointing out that in British venacular &#8216;Asian&rsquo; usually means South Asian, as in East Indian, Pakistani &amp; Bargladeshi. Whereas when Americans speak of &#8216;Asians&rsquo; they generally mean East Asians, as in the Chinese, koreans, Japanese, Tawainese and often the Vietnamese (aka orientals). Although to be fair, our wonderful census bureau lumps S. Asians into the &#8216;Asian&rsquo; category. Clearly South Asians are worse lot that E asians as many of the are moslem, the average IQ FOR the Indian sub- continent is probably no higher than 90, (despite all the brainy comp. programmers that flood the US), many continue to wear traditional garb (unlike modern orientals who where western clothes) and most give their kids non-american/british first names (which can&rsquo;t be said of a majority of orientals). But thats not to say E. Asian immigration is a good thing, the flow only goes one way, from the orient to the western world and almost never the other way &#8216;round. Their countries remain racially asian while ours are transformed. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right.  When I was little, my mother, and other loving relatives, pounded it in my head over and over again that talk is cheap, but actions are what count.  And your actions are based on the kind of person you are.  So strong are the links between what you do and who you are is that a decent person will do decent things, and a person that does rotten things must have a rotten character to begin with.  I was told:  If you see rotten apples on the ground, there is a rotten tree nearby.  If you find a rotten tree, you know there will soon be rotten apples lying around.</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s and Richard Nixon&rsquo;s apples are rotten because their trees are.  And the symbolism of their rotten trees extend to their cynical political careers   &mdash;   Both exploited white hopes and fears to win power, but did nothing to address those fears.  In Nixon&rsquo;s case, it was called the Southern Strategy.</p>

		<p>Thatcher and Nixon weren&rsquo;t &#8220;perfect&#8221; - but they definitely went against the tide to take our side. Check out who the enemies of Nixon and Thatcher were/are.</p>
<p>Washington Post, Hollywood, Lib/Mins.</p>
<p>Nixon won 49 out 50 states appealing to the White &#8220;silent majority&#8221;, law and order and end to Black riots in our cities.</p>
<p>Nixon was not an anti Semite Jew hater, just aware of the situation in certain key areas (washington post). All WN should study the successes of Nixon and Thatcher. Don&rsquo;t insist on perfection, contend to challenge, challenge to win. When you WIN, try to win something for our side. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rough world.</p>
<p>Nixon and Thatcher didn&rsquo;t hate our people and both could be counted on to give it out as well as take it.</p>

		<p>4) Like most leaders they were likely just following the course of action they thought would grant them continued or even more power.</p>
<p>Just because Nixon enacted pro-black laws that discriminated against whites, doesn&rsquo;t mean he didn&rsquo;t think they were inferior.  All it means is that he was looking after his own personal interests first.  Which is the main problem with every single white leader today(&#8220;fascist&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; politicians excluded, of course).</p>

		<p>30 years ago when Mrs Thatcher made those remarks, England was still recognisably England, in the sense that a clear majority of the population was ethnically English and the culture was strongly English.Yes, people complained about non-White immigrants, but compared to the state of play now existing in England they were a minor problem.<br>
 The sad fact is despite her words Mrs Thatcher did very, very little to curtial immigration or repatriate those here.The real disaster occurred in 1997 after the election of the New Labour government which well and truly &#8216;opened the gates of Hell&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Margaret Thatcher allowed MILLIONS of non-whites into Britain in her 10 year reign. This included fundamentalist moslems such as hook handed Abu Hamza and the fanatic leader of al-muhajiroun Omar Bakri. </p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher was always full of praise for South Asians, especially Indians and they funded her Tory party to the tune of millions of pounds sterling.</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher was responsible for pushing the Rhodesia-Zimbabwe government to hold further elections (after the ones that led moderate Bishop Abel Muzorewa to a power sharing government with Ian Smith) which allowed Marxist Robert Mugabe into power.</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher was and is no friend of the white race. Just like all white &#8216;CONservatives&rsquo; he only thing she was interested in CONserving was her large bank balance.</p>

		<p>#8 makes a good point about the confusion over the word &#8220;Asian&#8221;.  There&rsquo;s a world of difference between a Japanese and a Pakistani, the latter of which Britain has a great deal of trouble in regard to anti-Anglo crime.  And there IS a huge gap between the average IQ of northern and southern Asian groups.  I know that if a group of &#8220;Asians&#8221; were moving into my neighborhood, it would make a big dif to me whether they were Chinese, Hmongs, or Pakistanis.</p>

<p>To Question Diversity and Joe:</p>
<p>You are both spot on!</p>
<p>Except for one minor point; Nixon and Thatcher are far worse in that it is clear that they were aware of the dangers that nonwhites presented to their respective countries, but chose to &ldquo;keep up appearances&rdquo; progressive in policy, for the sole purpose of mollifying their elitist Red critics. That is the same as me cynically feeding you hemlock even though I know it will kill you, but insisting that it is a &ldquo;health food&rdquo; while I do it, just to amuse and delight your worst enemies. In short, a foolish and unforgivably criminal act; this is particularly true, if your worst enemies are also mine, who will only be appeased when we are all utterly obliterated.</p>
<p>Given how both Nixon and Thatcher ended up being brought down, the point is eloquently unambiguous!</p>

		<p>Joe and Question Diversity are dead right:  Don&rsquo;t listen to what they say - instead, look at what they do.  In spite of her remarks about the boat people, Margaret Thatcher did nothing to reduce mass third world immigration into Britain.  Why would she?  Her principal supporters and backers were grasping &#8220;wide-boys&#8221; who knew the price of everything and the value of nothing.  A steady supply of cheap labour was what they wanted!<br>
She is still lionized by many deluded &#8220;conservatives&#8221; in Britain, but she was like the surgeon who cures your in-growing toenail by amputating your leg.  The wounds her policies inflicted on the fabric of white working class British society will take many years to heal, if they ever do.</p>

                   It was Nixon who was personally responsible for enshrining &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; into law, not Johnson as commonly believed.<br>
 Also it was Nixon who was personally responsible for unleashing the financial turmoil that has wracked the World since 1971 (our present crisis is but another manifestation of it), by his treacherous and ignominious decision to renege on the US government&rsquo;s promise to redeem dollars for gold.<br>
The bottom line is that Nixon did nothing for White Americans, least of all the middle-class conservatives he cynically exploited in his odious &#8216;southern strategy&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Nixon also promulgated the infamous wage-price freeze of 1971, which led to a near recession. He wanted to reduce inflation to about 2% by doing so, and saw it climb to almost 9%, instead.</p>
<p>He was also no friend of the Second Amendment - indeed, he was as stridently pro-gun control as any liberal, Kennedy-type Democrat. He demanded obedience to &#8220;law and order&#8221;. He waffled on Vietnam, and got Kissinger to declare &#8220;peace is at hand&#8221;, a week before the election.</p>
<p>Of course, Democrats helped matters by running McGovern. Nixon made the mistake that so many re-elected presidents do, by interpreting their wins as &#8220;mandates from the people&#8221;. We all know where that led, in the end.     </p>

		<p>Funny you mention Nixon who was really not a Thacher contemporary. Reagan was the real disaster and he was our Thatcher.</p>
<p>Reagan could have stopped immigration after Carter&rsquo;s stupid Mariel boat lift but what did we get  - an amnesty.</p>
<p>His policies destroyed unions which were the major white working class political structire and were anti-immigration until now.</p>
<p>He made it easier for to minorities to get government jobs by abolishing the written tests.</p>
<p>His economic policies were the start of the destruction of the middle class - emphasis on banking and Wall Street.</p>
<p>Reagan expanded affirmative action - he gave &#8220;minority&#8221; status to Hassidic Jews and Asian Indians.</p>

<p>https://blog.vdare.com/archives/2008/03/29/aeys-awful-afghan-ammo-is-it-an-affirmative-action-scandal/</p>
<p>He allowed companies to use illegal aliens to break unions like the meatpackers.</p>
<p>https://www.citypaper.com/special/story.asp?id=6045</p>
<p>He also was instrumental in destroying the ability of tech workers to get a decent wage.</p>

<p>Compared to Reagan, Nixon was a rank amateur.<br>

People expected a racial backlash because of the history of this state with slavery and racism, but that didn&rsquo;t happen,&#8221; says Mr Garene. </p>
<p>I followed one of your links and read the above about Columbia, S.C. The reason the Somails were welcomed is because Columbia is about 90% black and going down hill very fast. I live in S.C. and I know what Columbia used to be like in the 70s and 80s, now it is basically a dangerous ghetto with a state capitol in it.</p>
