			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Cook, Christian Science Monitor, Dec. 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new Battleground Poll shows that &#8220;voters tend to describe themselves as angry, pessimistic, anxious, and depressed,&#8221; says Celinda Lake, president of Lake Research Partners, a political strategy firm that works for Democratic candidates. </p>
<p>Ms. Lake and Republican pollster Ed Goeas jointly oversee the Battleground Poll. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever mood the voters are in right now, they are likely to be in a particularly ornery mood toward every elected official by January,&#8221; Lake says. &#8220;And one of the more interesting places they may take this out is less at the federal election [level] and more at the governorships. You may see a record number of governorships change party.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Democrats in trouble?</strong></p>
<p>With Democrats holding control of both houses of Congress, angry voters could spell trouble for the party in 2010 elections, argues Mr. Goeas, CEO of the Tarrance Group. </p>
<p>&#8220;There is a potential for [2010] being a 1994 year of the angry white male,&#8221; Goeas says. That year, Democrats lost 54 seats and Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republican pollster Goeas thinks voters will focus more and more on the issue of federal spending as the economy improves. &#8220;The good news for Republicans is we lead&#8221; on who voters trust to handle wasteful spending by 44 to 32 percent, he says. </p>
<p>Goeas also notes that a second wave of voter concern on taxes normally follows a focus on spending. And Republicans also lead on the issue of holding down taxes. </p>
<p><strong>The Tea Party threat</strong></p>
<p>A new Rasmussen Poll found Tea Party candidates outpaced Republicans 23 percent to 18 percent in a generic congressional race. Goeas noted that the polling method used in getting this result tends to over count voters with especially intense feelings. </p>
<p>The Tea Party is &#8220;a very vocal group out there that have a very good point in terms of what is happening &hellip; but at the end of the day they are going to have to choose between who is the enemy,&#8221; Goeas says. &#8220;My advice has been &hellip; &#8216;We agree with you, hey let&rsquo;s go get &#8216;em&rsquo; as opposed to trying to control them, trying to lead them, trying to be part of them. At the end of the day, it is going to come down to a choice between two&#8221; main parties.<br>

		<p>The year of the Angry White MALE???  Hey, you sexists, there are a whole lot of us white females who are just as angry and fed up as are our male counterparts!!!  Together we will take back our nation and do whatever is necessary to get rid of the socialist/marxists who are currently in power.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Tea Party is &ldquo;a very vocal group out there that have a very good point in terms of what is happening &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;re the ones to join right now.  I&rsquo;m new to the movement, but they seem to have a group in almost every large city.  Every state for sure, and their numbers are huge.</p>
<p>By getting up and out to go to that 1 million protest march in D.C. it proved they&rsquo;re the party for activists who feel like there&rsquo;s too many couch potatoes complaining but doing nothing.  They drove from all over the country for two weeks in a caravan to get to the protest, which reveals their passions, since it had to be time off from work for most of them.  That&rsquo;s the type of people to connect with.</p>
<p>People who shriek hysterically on here about refusing to connect with any group that&rsquo;s not an in-your-face type, would be happier on a white militant site.</p>
<p>The last time I visited the tea party site, they had a Racewatch category to post to, which means that it&rsquo;s a great opportunity for WN&rsquo;s to offer examples of non-white hate and racism in order to introduce them to the facts of life slowly.  Keep in mind it&rsquo;s going to have to be gradual, because most all those people know FULLWELL that the radicals in the media are just waiting to spread charges of racism all over their front pages to marginalize them.  Concentrating on anti-white hate is a way to avoid that and educate people at the same time.</p>
<p>There are 4 web sites now that are REALLY worth joining: 1) Amren, of course, 2)Council of Conservative Citizens, 3)European-American Issues Forum and 4) Tea party forum (www.resistnet.com)</p>
<p>If anyone knows of an effective, moderate group I might have missed, please let me know.</p>

		<p>Claremont White Lady, Amen to that! The only way we as whites can unite and secure our futures is if white men and women struggle together. I too would like to see &#8220;Angry White Male&#8221; become &#8220;Angry White.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think the media know that the Democrats would lose in normal circumstances.  This is why they love &#8220;tea parties&#8221; now, because they want to split the right wing vote.  Unlike before, when they used a disgusting name of sexual innuendo when referring to the Tea Party movement.</p>
<p>That, and they&rsquo;re trying to explain away what might be a Republican landslide, blaming it on the frustrations of white men, as if white men are somehow less than human.</p>
<p>If you forced me to predict right now, the Republicans will win seats, but not enough to gain control of the House.  The reason is that (1) Republicans run the Republican Party, they&rsquo;ll find some way to muck it up, (2) The Republican brand is still somewhat damaged.  In the Senate, I think the Republicans will gain, but very few.  In MO and OH, Democrats will probably replace retiring Republicans, which will offset some R gains.  In those states, Republicans are running old establishment talking heads, and at least in MO, the Democrat (Robin Carnahan) is her to a political dynasty in the state.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As an aside, looking back on the last decade, does it seem to any of the rest of you that it was a phony ten year period?  It&rsquo;s too long and slightly too off topic to discuss at length here, but I&rsquo;m calling this decade that&rsquo;s about to end the &#8220;Decade That Seemed&#8221; rather than the Decade That Was.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Angry White Male&#8221;, of course, is a term applied to any white male who demonstrates even so much as a modicum of self-respect and assertiveness when dealing with the incredible amount of government sponsored and media enabled bigotry tossed in his direction. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been the year of the Angry White Male for quite some time.  It&rsquo;s only been exacerbated by the election of Hussein Hopenchange and the dramatic shift to socialism.  Americans are tired of unresponsive, irresponsible government, political correctness and the massive debt being created by our &#8220;leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the growth of my blog is a key, 2010 and beyond will be the decade of the Angry White Male&hellip;and dude!</p>

<p>&hellip;and just after that great victory of electoral populism the &#8220;Republicans&#8221; quickly forced an even more egregious situation upon the angry white males with GATT, the general agreement on tariffs and trade; brain child of G.H.W. Bush, which is more free trade with communist China with the added bonus where the US government picks up the Chinese freight to equalize the international playing field on the US economy.  Then the good, conscientious Republicans, feeling the heat and responding to the unified voice of white male America, passed SB 666 aka The Contract on America.  This piece of paper basically nullified in its entirety the other piece of paper called the US Constitution&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes the angry white male has a lot of power in the greatest democracy ever to appear in the entire known universe.</p>

		<p>Angry Whites - that&rsquo;s what I want to hear! I come to Amren for that purpose.  I&rsquo;ve long wondered whether Amren readers are representative of society at large, and frankly I meet so many people who seem completely brainwashed that sometimes I get discouraged. It seems that the realists are a tiny clique who rant in small internet forums and are ignored by the vast majority.</p>
<p>But sometimes I see hopeful signs. At <a href="http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/015097.html" rel="nofollow">View from the Right</a> Larry Auster reports on a CBS News story about a typical black wilding of a lone White boy in Englewood, NJ.</p>
<p>In typical style, the reporter avoided any mention of race. But the readers are not fooled, and they are angry. The news site deleted the readers&rsquo; comments, but not before Auster copied them. They make encouraging reading. Could have been posted here.</p>

<p>The original media reports about this had it being a Hispanic &#8220;group of youths&#8221; beating up a Hispanic 8th grader because he accidentally threw a basketball at a girl, and the girl had the gang go out after him.</p>

		<p>The problem with the 94 election was Bush, a RINO if there ever was one. His presidency was probably the worst in history. He loved Hispanics more than Americans. And a few days after the 9 11 attacks he had Muslim leaders for a special dinner in the White House. Sickening.People were so sick of the inept, idiotic and unpatriotic Bush they elected the smooth talking Kenyan. And despite the deserved dislike of Obama the Republicans had better run a patriotic smart person for president or they will lose again.Another Dole or McCain won&rsquo;t do it. A third party candidate would probably be best but that if pretty iffy. The major parties, unfortunately, still dominate elections. Maybe Sarah could be the one, but I don&rsquo;t know her stance on immigration. </p>

		<p>Given the fact that 37% of eligible voters don&rsquo;t vote in the US we should expect to see in every election year the common words used to describe their feelings about the US democratic system as &#8220;angry&#8221;, &#8220;pessimistic&#8221;, &#8220;anxious&#8221;, and &#8220;depressed&#8221;. More and more people each year feel that the major parties don&rsquo;t represent them, and rightly they should too.</p>

A long-term (anus) with $11 million in his campaign account, and no serious challenger? Definitely needs to go. On a rail, tar and feathered would be nice; but I&rsquo;ll just settle for gone.</p>

		<p>My grandfather and father were WHITE men. My brothers are WHITE men. My husband of 35 years is a WHITE man, and our sons are WHITE men. You betcha this WHITE woman is gonna stand by her WHITE men and honor the memory of those WHITE men who have gone before. My WHITE daughters will stand too, because they are raising small sons, who will be WHITE men all too soon. We, now the older generation have to stand fast so there will be a place for our WHITE grandchildren and great-grandchildren in this, the land of their forefathers. Built by WHITE men, fought and died for by succeeding generations of their WHITE ancestors, to preserve it for them, their WHITE decendants.</p>

		<p>Yes, thank you Claremont, usually I suspect the white males don&rsquo;t care or else are too thick, they turn over and act like wimps amidst all the events currently unfolding.  I keep waiting for a movement to start, and here I am in the prime of my youth, ready to act on my most sincere and thought out impulses (yes, i tend to agree with this site)  - yet still i wait, i am like a female jihadi - of one, alone. A one woman act, considering my demographic.  </p>

		<p>being angry is OK if you understand SOMETHING about what is actually going on.</p>
<p>babbling about &#8220;communist takeovers&#8221; in a corporate, bank, investment firm, blackwater run oligarchy is pretty stupid.</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s health reforms are a weird mixture of socialism &amp; giveaways to the insurance forms.</p>
<p>its easy to be mad at a black mugger, but what about the corporate oligarchy that created the immigration, AA, PC mess in the first place?</p>
<p>or did you really think a ragtag, potsmoking bunch of flaky lestist lesbian grad students were actually running the country??</p>
<p>Oh, my&hellip;..</p>
<p>MULTICULTURALISM IS THE IDEOLOGY OF THE CORPORATE OLIGARCHY. </p>
<p>they want cheap labor and a disorganized labor force that fights amongst itself.</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be better off with a good old-fashioned labor movement that talked about wages and the rights of working people.</p>
<p>Yeah, remember them?? they were the ones who kept immigration halted until 1925!!!!! </p>
<p>you folks need a MUCH MUCH better analysis of the situation to fight back effectively.</p>

<p>Sarah Palin is another George Bush with more socially conservative values.  It became clear what her stance on immigration was during the election when she said she didn&rsquo;t believe in deporting illegals.  If the Republicans want someone smart then they would do well to pass on her.  It appears we&rsquo;re all being set up by the media to accept this woman as the next presidential candidate even though she has never done or said anything that would motivate me to vote for her.  Your being hypnotized everytime Newsmax runs a commercial saying America has been electrified and their hearts captured by Sarah Palin at the same time trying to hock her book at fire sale prices, with glowing reviews from a long list of neocons.  The Republicans might make some gains in 2010 but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll take back either houses.  The gains will mostly come from paleoconservative/libertarians at the expense of the neocons.  The Republican Party hasn&rsquo;t changed course so why would people go out and vote for more &#8220;free trade&#8221;, globalism and amnesty, these have become staples of the party.     </p>

		<p>I wonder how much change we can really expect.  The politically suicidal behavior we&rsquo;re currently witnessing from Democrats at all levels might well indicate another truly ominous development:<br>
To wit, they&rsquo;re confident they&rsquo;ve got such a massive voter fraud apparatus in place in all big city precincts that they&rsquo;re virtually immune to any such seismic electoral event as a massive Democratic rollback.  Nothing else adequately explains their seeming indifference to the coming backlash.</p>
<p>The Republican reticence to address voter fraud is truly puzzling. One can only speculate that they&rsquo;re so terrified of being branded &#8220;racists&#8221; by simply investigating voter fraud in the big city precincts that they&rsquo;re impotent in the face of this threat. Of course, a Republican with moral courage is a rare phenomenon indeed.</p>
<p>Voter fraud is a direct assault on the integrity of the Republic and deserves the same penalty as espionage in wartime.</p>

		<p>The first step is to explore the potential to repatriate non-Whites back to their countries of origin. </p>
<p>It is obvious that Blacks have no place in civilization. They belong in Africa. Hispanics have no place in the United States. They belong in Latin America. Likewise, Asians belong in Asia, Indians belong in India, Muslims belong in Arabia, and American Indians belong on reservations. </p>
<p>Mixing the races and ethnicities is the idea of a relatively small group of misguided Whites in power. Their greedy goals are incompatible with natural design. Forcing us all to coexist is madness and serves no purpose other than to line their own pockets at YOUR expense. </p>
<p>That same group of Whites is not concerned with culture, family, religion, tradition, heritage, or any other human characteristics. They are only concerned about acquiring more wealth and power. They are manipulating all races for personal gain! Wake up, my friends!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t appreciate Mr. Goeas already trying to suggest that supporting the Tea Party is a waste of time and that at the end of the day it will STILL come down to the two main parties.  I am hoping that they are underestimating the Tea Party.  At first the MSM was portraying us as racist rabble and malcontents, in other words, trying to discredit us from the get-go.  I think the Tea Party is the only hope for this country.  As I watched all the old bas***ds in both houses vote the way they always do,.. AGAINST THE PEOPLE.  We need to throw all of them out of office, AND!!!   the appointed, dual-citizenship shadow government who dictate to them how to vote.   </p>

The whole integration argument falls flat on its face due to the fact that blacks will not learn.  Learning is considered to be &#8220;acting white&#8221; and is routinely discouraged by blacks themselves.  A black that wants to learn will be castigated and ridiculed by his &#8220;peers&#8221;.<br>
Black &#8220;role models&#8221; in the predominantly black public schools do seem to be doing much to foster &#8220;self-esteem&#8221; in their charges.  However, learning is not part of the equation.<br>
The few remaining whites and asians are needed to help boost the dismal test scores.</p>

I suspect this preemptive strategy of dismissing the concerns of &#8216;angry white males&rsquo; is an attempt to label dissent as racism.</p>
<p>Perhaps whites are waking up to the fact that they are being displaced and marginalized. Some of them are going to be speaking out.</p>
<p>We have the truth on our side. If we present our case and concerns with the facts and without virulent anger, we can get our points across.</p>
<p>As someone else noted, look for the rise of FBI, ADL, SPLC provocateurs such as Hal Turner to stir the pot and make whites look dangerous.</p>
<p>The cards are stacked against us but if we keep our cool and do not let the provocateurs speak for us, we can win the debate.</p>

		<p>It never used to bother me so much, but for the last five years it seems that anytime the media shows a white male, even in the movies, he&rsquo;s presented as a complete dolt, a druggie or a slimy boardroom evil-doer.  When was the last time you remember in a commercial when a white guy was a normal guy?  They&rsquo;re always presented as clueless buffoons who need a (woman/minority/minority woman) to help them out of their problem.  As a white male, I demand my rights to be free of stereotyping and discrimination.  In my profession, you rarely see any white males - they&rsquo;re just not hired anymore.  I want my Martin Luther King promised Civil Rights!  Take that NAACP! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised to see that not a single Amren reader truly understands this issue, what is going on and what is about to happen.</p>
<p>So let me spell it out for you.</p>
<p>Democrat vs Republican no longer matters.  Obama no longer matters (although he doesn&rsquo;t know it yet).  The Congress and the high court no longer matter.</p>
<p>Why?  Because the entire government, top to bottom is about to go bankrupt. Literally, there is no solution, no way to stop it, or even a way to slow it down.  It will happen and the issue will be opened with an &#8220;audit&#8221; of the federal reserve.</p>
<p>The US is going to have to default on its national debt.  However, that is not a big deal since every nation on earth, pretty much, is going to have to default on its national debt.</p>
<p>We have a ton of wealth and power in our country but the system by which it is used has broken down under the weight of corruption and idiot social engineering.  Government as we know it and international trade as we know it are going to go through a period where they are severely weakened and often non-existent.</p>
<p>Most social programs in the US will disappear overnight.  Most federal support of local systems will disappear overnight.  Cities like Detroit, LA, NYC&hellip;..these places will burn to the ground.  Everywhere else, people will need to band together, similar to what happens in any other disaster (think Katrina), help each other and rebuild institutions on local and state levels to organize people to provide for themselves, their families and communities.  There could be open warfare between &#8220;normal&#8221; communities and the types of people we all saw during the Katrina disaster.  However, I don&rsquo;t think that will happen much beyond places the two types of communities are very nearby each other.  I think the Katrina types are so helpless and inept that they cannot move themselves from one geographic location to another, let alone organize themselves to victimize a cohesive community.</p>
<p>What I am saying is there will be no meaningful flushing out of those responsible.  No takeover of our government by responsible types to fix the problem.  Or rather, there could be, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.  The problem reached a point of no return a long time ago and now everything is on the cusp of falling apart.</p>
<p>For the short term, people should simply make sure they live in a community of normal people, far away from the Katrina type of people.  So that when the worst happens the response they can expect is a pulling together of everyone&hellip;.as opposed to roaming gangs of drug addled psychopaths murdering, raping and pillaging (as happened during Katrina).  I can&rsquo;t stress that enough.  If you live someplace funky, it&rsquo;s time to move&hellip;.now.  You might not be allowed to do so later.</p>
<p>For the long term?  There is going to be a tremendous vaccuum of power as our &#8220;leaders&#8221; basically wash their hands of all responsibility and vamoose for whatever safe place they already prepared (and believe it&hellip;.they ALL know what is coming).  That invites people to step in and take control.  In fact, that is a large part of the reason all this has happened.  It was the goal.  They were hoping that sick totalitarian marxism would fill that vaccuum.  The joke is on them, however.  They&rsquo;ve spent generations destroying our system but not even 5 minutes preparing seriously for the herculean effort that would have to come next.  Who takes over has nothing to do with ideology or even numbers.  It has to do with whom can provide.  Take a good long look at Obama, Pelosi, Frank, Reid etc.  Could they and the freaks who support them&hellip;..provide?  Could their leadership organize people to save themselves?  The idea is ridiculous in the extreme.  Anyone stupid enough to follow them will realize their mistake within minutes&hellip;.not weeks.  Realistically, when nobody will listen to them anymore&hellip;..unless it is to punish them for the hand they had in this.</p>
<p>White nationalists, on the other hand, have been thinking about this and preparing for a very long time.  When times were good and the enemy had near totalitarian control over everything because most people were able to rely on &#8220;the system&#8221; they took over to provide, nobody was willing to listen.  But when that system goes bye bye, they will be listening.  They will NEED such people desperately.  Their first need will be to know what happened&hellip;.what&rsquo;s going on.  When things were normal, they could care less.  When the money in their pockets is no longer worth anything anywhere and the TV shows only static&hellip;.well, then they will care.</p>
<p>That will be the time to act.  Not on a national level but on a local level.  Individuals who know what happened and why will need to make sure that is known and considered as people rebuild.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for the medium term because EVERY community has traitors who contributed to this for various reasons&hellip;.stupidity, ignorance, mental illness, or even just plain old malevolence.  That needs to be addressed and those people restrained.</p>
<p>In the long term, however, a healthy race consciousness and a thorough understanding of who, how and why our nation was infiltrated and destroyed from within MUST be developed.</p>
<p>Or it will happen again.</p>

<p>Another reason I&rsquo;m not worried about our national debt, especially the part owed to China, is that China is in a Catch-22 with all the American debt they own.  They can&rsquo;t call it in at one time, or that&rsquo;ll destroy the American economy, and therefore the ability of Americans to buy Chinese-made goods.  </p>
<p>The other reason is that even if we didn&rsquo;t or couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t redeem the securities, what could China do about it?  Invade?  There&rsquo;s a bright idea   &mdash;   invade a country which has the world&rsquo;s most powerful military, and even if they could get past that, they have to garrison a country where privately owned firearms are as common as leaves on trees in summertime.</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;angry white male&#8221; was invented by liberals to make legitimate resentment and fury seem like mere petulance and buffoonery.  By placing the focus on &#8220;anger&#8221; (i.e. a character flaw), the actual source of the anger - the orchestrated dispossession of a formerly white nation and culture - is given a free pass.</p>

		<p>If NATIVE BORN  WHITE  AMERICAN MALES ARE angry now&hellip;how much more angrier would they be if Amnesty was passed? Just a thought experiment. Would worse be better now or twenty years from now when the post-1965 non-white population is much bigger.</p>
<p>I believe now is the time for a full-blown WHITE RACIAL REVOLT now. Amnesty would do it.</p>
<p>If amnesty was passed now, it would put numbersusa,FAIR,CIS and Ghenn&rsquo;s-republican party operative- silly organization out of business. The taunting of NATIVE BORN WHITE MALES would be so severe on a daily basis-and if you throw in a prolonged economic collapse&hellip;..WHITE NATIONLAISM ans AMERICAN RENASSAINCE would be the only politically viable game in town. The $$$$$$ would start flowing towards AR. No more silly nonesense about immigration is bad because it harms the non-white IMMIGRANTS. Don&rsquo;t you want to puke when you read this kind of stuff over at numbersusa.com.</p>
<p>The passage of amnesty is  avery scary idea&hellip;but it is going to happen at some point in time. There needs to be catastrophic events-the more the better- to empty out the football stadiums and basketball arenas.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t place 100% of the blame on the GOP. The A Number One mistake that people make is the belief that politics only counts on election day. All too many voters back in 1994 voted out the Dems, defeated &#8220;Hillarycare&#8221;, neutered the Clinton administration, and then promptly went back to sleep after congratulating themselves on their &#8220;victory&#8221;.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work that way, and you have to keep paying attention. What would have happened back then if the voting public had held these brand new Republican Senators and Congress Critters to that &#8220;Contract With America&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;The price of liberty is eternal vigilance&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole system is predicated on an <i>informed</i> and <i>engaged</i> electorate. There are no two ways about this. If those we elect go astray, then it&rsquo;s our fault, and nobody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We better remember that after the 2010 mid-terms, and the 2012 presidential regardless of how these turn out. Handing Mr. Hopechange a defeat is not a cause to celebrate and quit paying attention.</p>

		<p>Neither party has the power or the will to really change things. The situation will continue to deteriorate, a phrase that echoes from history.</p>
<p>The Democrats will certainly not seize the banner of race realism, and the Republicans have given no indication of being willing to do so. On the contrary, in their quest for stray votes, they now court the non-whites, particularly the latinos. Race realism - for lack of a better term - is indispensable to any solution to our problems. The fiction of racial and cultural equality must cease, and the lie of white oppression repudiated, and the fact that western societies are being mongrelized to their great detriment explicitly recognized. To do so is a surefire political career killer.</p>
<p>And so, the situation will continue to deteriorate&hellip;.<br>

		<p>To the female posters on this forum, I think there is a deliberate &#8216;divide and conquer&rsquo; strategy is qualifying the phrase down to angry White <b>male</b>.<br>
Emphasizing a male vs female division.<br>
Destroying the traditional White Christian family unit has always been on the agenda by those who do not or can not fit into this model.<br>
And as we know White liberals are only ever direct and aggressive with other Whites.<br>
When dealing with non Whites, they prefer more convert methods like quietly raising their children in your schools(at the expense of your own children to appear &#8216;fair&rsquo;) and rehabilitating them in your prisons (at least at that point the state owns them but again at who&rsquo;s expense?), non Whites are just meant to take notes and &#8216;follow the lead&rsquo; when it comes to man/woman issues.<br>
In reality though, to the rest of the world&rsquo;s men, it just looks like the men of the West have been emasculated and all those White woman need is a good&hellip;&hellip;.man, in is some ways they are right (but I better qualify that statement). <br>
For instances when you look at how all of our gadgets have made us lazy, obese, self centered, how popular culture has feminized us and how we all seem to vainly seem to fear getting &#8216;old&rsquo; (both sexes on that one) just for a few examples.<br>
The only way you can fight back nature is with constant maintenance. But in the end nature always wins.<br>
But on the man/woman front &#8220;United we stand, divided we fall.&#8221;<br>

<p>To all females reading here who might feel left out or slighted by the phrase &#8220;Angry White Male,&#8221; please do not take offense at this &#8220;sexist&#8221; language! </p>
<p>I am one Angry White Male who&rsquo;s only too happy to find Angry White Females   &mdash;   and I welcome you to the White Man&rsquo;s struggle. Indeed, you are a NECESSARY part of the struggle in that every Angry White Male needs a White Female (preferably at least <i>somewhat</i> angry) to help his raise Angry White Children. </p>
<p>I think the phrase has defaulted to &#8220;Angry White MALES&#8221; (rather than, say, &#8220;Angry White People&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;Angry Persons of Whiteness&#8221;) only because males are very much the majority of today&rsquo;s Angry Whites. Tomorrow, I hope the White Anger will become a much more gender-equal affair, with Angry White Males and Females working shoulder-to-shoulder as equals to save our people. But at the moment, there are (sadly) damnably few ethnically European females who think the AmRen way. Such magnificent people are very rare indeed! </p>
<p>Rather than complain about gender bias amongst White Advocates, I&rsquo;d prefer that race-conscious caucasian women directed their energies toward trying to convert other White Females to our side. Because those women probably won&rsquo;t listen to us White Males   &mdash;   but they MIGHT listen to you! </p>

		<p>They need to be worried about the &#8220;ANGRY WHITE FEMALES&#8221; coming up behind them. They have effectively destroyed every avenue of defence for white women and their children from the murderous, raping, torturing thugs of  every non-white description. They have neutralized our white males. If he dares to try to protect his white woman or white child against a non-white, he is immediately slapped into jail and accused of committing a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;. Since our men are not allowed to protect us and our children, we will do it. When we are backed up against the wall, fighting, not only for our children, but also for our men, they will WISH they were fighting angry white MALES! I predict it will take a little more time for the majority of white women to clearly see what is going on, but when they do, we will find a way to band together, then the non-whites had better run, hide or get out of Dodge, because we will have none of the mercy of the angry white MALES. Count on it. </p>

<p>First, Readers on this site need to get behind a Political Party that champions the U.S. Constitution, as the bedrock which our Republic is built.</p>
<p>I have suggested two Parties, which are the America First Party, and the Constitution Party. Visit the websites for both, and then decide which you will join, and become active in. </p>
<p>Secondly, I have posted on other Forums, just how to take our Country back from Liberal, Marxist, Tree hugging whack jobs, and this is it: </p>
<p>Start locally, since all Politics are local. That means get involved in your School&rsquo;s PTA, and then try and become an Officer.</p>
<p>From there, run for School Board, which has the power to hire and fire Teachers, and approve Text books, for use in the School cirriculum. You should note that &#8220;former&#8221; Terrorist, Bill Ayers, of the Weather Underground, sits on the Board which currently approves Grade School, and High School Text books, nationally. This is something we need to put the breaks on, today.</p>
<p>Also, as a member of the School Board, you can keep those Teachers that do work there, on a short leash, and from straying from the assigned, Academic cirriculum. </p>
<p>We need to keep our children from Communist indoctrination, and let them actually get the chance to receive a quality education.</p>
<p>From there, as our organizational skills are honed, we will branch out to local Government, such as Village Trustee, Village Justice, and Mayor. </p>
<p>As our reputation and political experiences grow, we will then move toward Town Supervisor, and Town Clerk level Offices, and then onto the County levels of County Clerk, County Executive, and one of the most important positions of all, County Sheriff. </p>
<p>Our newly elected people in Village, Town, and County level positions will give great backing to those of our Party that will go on to seek State Legislative, and Senate elective Offices. Once we control the State Houses, we can finally move a Candidate for Governor, and Secretary of State, in each respective State. </p>
<p>We will eventually take the U.S. Senate seats, and many Districts for Congress, as well. </p>
<p>Then, we Elect our own to the White House. This is how it should be done. Instead of the All-or-Nothing approach, shooting for top National Offices, and expecting to win, let&rsquo;s do this like a Chess game, in a series of calculated moves, to gain the end resluts we want. </p>

		<p>&#8216;Angry Whites&rsquo; just doesn&rsquo;t sound that bad, does it? I think the MSM; liberals, blacks, hispanics and other enemies of the white race really do not get it. I guess we have been discounted and disrespected for so long, that these people really do not know what they are dealing with however, we have only ourselves to blame for this ignorance.</p>
<p>For far too long we have remained quiet as we have made concession after concession to the whining minorities that contribute nearly absolute zero to our society and when you consider all that is given to them, the net gain is actually NEGATIVE! Yet, we continue to empower them. Everyday, there is another story of some violent crime against a White by a non-White and yet, we remain silent. Many of us have bought into the idea that we are all equal with the exception of our skin tone. We allow ourselves to be ashamed of our great history and spend too much time apologizing for past indiscretions instead teaching our youth to be proud or our own culture.</p>
<p>Our race has built civilizations and we can destroy them as well. &#8216;This country was founded by Whites for Whites&rsquo;&hellip;end of story. Through greed or some misguided sense of altruism, we have allowed this country to degrade to what it is today. If we do not take action, we WILL be a third or second world country in our own lifetimes. Many of us speak about how great our race is and all the wonderful things that we have invented or built. However, there is a darker side to our people.</p>
<p>While Whites can be the most generous and creative of all the peoples of the world, we can be the most evil, brutal and destructive as well. The &#8216;60&rsquo;s black militants were on point when they spoke of the horrors and destruction our people can bring when incited to do so. History is lined with the brutality and destruction we can inflect, the Roman Empire, the Civil War, WWI and WWII just to name a few. Like other races, Whites will kill their own to meet their goal.  An ICBM could never have been built by a non-White nation. Even today, non-Whites would not be able to match some of our oldest technologies without the help of Whites.</p>
<p>We have built empires over the bodies of those that got in the way&hellip;no brag, just fact. No, Angry Whites are just the first of a few stages. The next stage will be a polarization of those like minded Whites followed by the decision to act. Those Whites that side with the non-Whites will share the same fate. No quarter will be given. Make no mistake; the government knows that a few million Angry Whites cannot be silenced once the decision is made to stop this madness. That may be one of the reasons why very rarely is the race of the perpetrator and victim is given if it is a b on W crime. Keep the masses dumb until it is too late (thank God for the internet).  I do not think we could ever come to this, but it is plausible and only the unwitting fool would discount the danger of having a few million focused Angry Whites to contend with. </p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and I know I do not want to be on the opposite side of those &#8216;Angry Whites&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Yes there is anger. The following is my take on the central issue:<br>
  From a commentary on Marx in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:<br>
&#8220;If we start with the idea that the point of ideas of justice is to resolve disputes, then a society without disputes would have no need or place for justice. We can see this by reflecting upon Hume&rsquo;s idea of the circumstances of justice. Hume argued that if there was enormous material abundance  &mdash;  if everyone could have whatever they wanted without invading another&rsquo;s share  &mdash;  we would never have devised rules of justice. And, of course, Marx often suggested that communism would be a society of such abundance. But Hume also suggested that justice would not be needed in other circumstances; if there were complete fellow-feeling between all human beings. Again there would be no conflict and no need for justice. Of course, one can argue whether either material abundance or human fellow-feeling to this degree would be possible, but the point is that both arguments give a clear sense in which communism transcends justice&hellip;.<br>
Complete fellow feeling&hellip; think about it. <br>
So the next time you hear blacks scream &#8220;No justice no peace..&#8221; ask yourself&hellip;is this a plea for fellow feeling or an incitement to race war? And if it is an incitement, and it seems to be so, why should white people want to stay integrated with these who feel such hatred for us? Isn&rsquo;t this an open invitation to cut all ties with them? But, this also doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the goal for blacks. What they want is even more involvement of whites in their affairs. They want forced integration of schools, for example. This they want because presumably the mere presence of white students will magically rub off on them and help them&hellip;? Could any argument be more inane? <br>
And if the first part of the commentary wherein it is stated that justice is obviated in the presence of plenty provided the plenty is unviolently apportioned, I wonder which would be easier for all to achieve? A complete transformation of the American economy in order to ensure each and all have &#8220;plenty&#8221; and there is no argument AT ALL about the division, or simple social separation given that fellow feeling is much easier achieved in that way?<br>
Thus we see the reason for Obama&rsquo;s rhetoric about transformation. He is well aware the clock is ticking out on the integrationist program. He is well aware the USA is soon to be undergoing secessionism. <br>
I say Long Live a Separate White Homeland.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to start a war between the sexes, but I have to say that when I read your post, I was a little stunned&hellip;I have yet to witness a white woman do anything but either completely ignore racial issues, or grimace in discomfort when they are raised. </p>
<p>As my patience with the likes of ghetto blacks and &#8220;third worlders&#8221; has all but vanished, I try to take every opportunity to display racial allegiance in situations where my intent to do so is obvious. </p>
<p>For instance, black movie-goers&hellip;no need for further explanation, correct? Not very long ago I intervened on behalf of a white woman and her teenaged daughter at a local theater. </p>
<p>Yes, the blacks were making me miserable as well, and yes, I&rsquo;m a pretty big guy so maybe I have more leeway in dealing with their ignorant behavior, but there didn&rsquo;t seem to be a hint of appreciation. </p>
<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t expect a thank you for what is otherwise expected of any man in similar circumstances, but how about some indication from white women that they expect this support from white men? </p>
<p>I know this post might sound like a rant, however it isn&rsquo;t meant to be, and I&rsquo;m not knocking the other supportive women who post here (Gayle Sollenberger for instance). </p>
<p>Your post is really one of the few times though that I&rsquo;ve ever heard a white woman speak with any passion in defense of white people/white men. Up until now my view was that white women were pretty much in a &#8220;Take It or Leave It&#8221; frame of mind. </p>

		<p>&#8221; The problem reached a point of no return a long time ago and now everything is on the cusp of falling apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>2010 should be the year that will make it perfectly clear, to those who can see, that we are finished as an empire and as a social engineering project put in place by mentally ill radicals.</p>
<p>Commercial real estate should go south rapidly in 2010, as well as an acceleration of foreclosures and defaults of prime mortgages.  This time there will be no stimulous money to temporarily prop up the economy.  We are out of money.  The only way the fed has of getting more is to print it.  </p>
<p>By printing more, based on nothing, inflation will go ballistic; the dollar will collapse; gold will skyrocket to 2 or 3 thousand dollars per ounce, and the economy will be in utter shambles.</p>
<p>I agree that the area in which one lives will dictate whether or not he survives, because crime will be rampant, riots will be the order of the day, kidnappings will be common place and, generally, law and order will suffer a complete breakdown.</p>
<p>Most people are not buying this scenario right now, but by the end of 2010 it should become abundantly clear to most that we likely will not make it out of the growing instability, intact as one nation.</p>

<p>I am not ready to leave my School District, which was always one of the top performers in the State, and let it go to the few Minorities that are here. Those few are East Indian, Koreans, and Chinese. </p>
<p>We do not have trouble with Gangs or graffiti, etc., that many of you, mostly Teachers, have written about. And we intend on keeping it that way.

<p>Rather I would use the money not paid to the Town, for School Tax, to either pay for Private School, or Parochial School education, or to obtain the necessary materials needed, for Home Schooling. If more Whites, in one local area, did the same thing, the Town, and the Feds, would have to relent, or face the total collapse of an underfunded School system.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;voters tend to describe themselves as angry, pessimistic, anxious, and depressed,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those are just code words from whites who are losing some of their unearned white privilege. They are mad that social justice is making them uncomfortable and inconvenienced.  Their anger is based on systemic and institutional racism. The more angry they are, the more racist they are. Whites need to overcome their anger and embrace Multicultural Diversity and stop complaining that Obama is fundamentally transforming America for the worse. Whites are in the process of being non majoritized by the growing latino-hispano-afrovoodoo coalitions of power, and the white managerial elites will help them along and keep a big share of  power and wealth for themselves. Everyone but real whites has a moral cover. Everyone can shout &#8220;racism&#8221; at us anytime we complain about the growing non white populations and cultural and governmental changes.  </p>
<p>It all goes back to Brown vs. Board in 1954. As soon as the Federal Government decided that whites must pay the price for whiteness and was successful at implementing by force the integration of the races in public schools, the game was over. Was just a matter of time before we would have an Obamanation and complete defeat of a once proud white race.  Stop arguing for freedom and liberty. Those have been gone since 1954.  If you still have anything of freedom and liberty remaining, those are just artifacts of a racist paradigm and will be vandalized. </p>
<p>Your best option is to get over being angry and start deciding how you will survive the coming latino-hispano-afrovoodoo-white elite tyranny.  It&rsquo;s too late to think you will ever turn back the tide of progress and degradation.  Teaching your daughters about who killed  Julie Love, Eve Carson, Christian Shannon, Anne Pressley is a required first step in their survival training.  <br>

<p>I guess 90% white is a victory to some.  Try cracking open the history books they use.  It&rsquo;s the history of minority struggle against the white race.  It&rsquo;s the same history, but from the Marxian point of view. </p>
<p>Also, teachers are trained to use group indoctrination techniques, unknowingly to most of them. It&rsquo;s in the structure and practice of the curriculum.  Frame the situation to the Marxist point of view, dialog to a consensus, and characterize dissenting opinions as hateful.  </p>
<p>Just the practice of having to suppress our cultural norms so others don&rsquo;t feel let out is devastating.  It becomes ingrained that the children are expected to accommodate those who are different at the expense of themselves.  The practice of self censoring and not speaking out becomes second nature.  Then they carry this right into the work place.</p>
<p> If I bought poisoned food I wouldn&rsquo;t feed it to my kids just because I paid for it.  Every, and I do mean every, white person I talk to about public schools says the exact same thing, &#8220;Our public schools are different&#8221;.  The culture in every single one of these places is MSM based.  Save the children-don&rsquo;t worry about the money.<br>

<p>It comes back to how parents interact and teach their children in the home, at the earliest stages of life, that have the greatest impact on children.</p>
<p>My children were never placed in Day Care. They were with their Mother, all day long, or when necessary, their Aunts, or Grandmother. There were no outside influences to try and poison their minds. </p>
<p>Likewise, from the very beginning, we monitored what Cartoons they could watch, often opting to buy the Cartoons that we watched when we were growing up, such as, &#8220;Popeye&#8221;, &#8220;The Flintstones&#8221;, &#8220;The Jetsons&#8221;, and &#8220;Bugs Bunny&#8221;. </p>
<p>Our children are also not permitted to mix with non-Whites. Being friendly toward people on the street, in a civil manner, is a big difference from having Sunday dinner with them.</p>
<p>How many two year olds could point out George Washington&rsquo;s picture in a book, or computer screen? Mine could. They could also tell you which one was Robert E. Lee, and for which side that he was a General. </p>
<p>My children also sang such songs as &#8220;Bonnie Blue Flag&#8221;, &#8220;Dixie&#8221;, and &#8220;I&rsquo;m A Good Ole Rebel&#8221;, word for word, at that young age. </p>

		<p>Angry white females exist, but the MSM and our society don&rsquo;t want you to know that.  To them, white females are altruistic and tolerant, liberal-minded and have emotion hemorraghing out of their pores.  White females are not supposed to do a double take when they see an interracial couple (preferably white of either sex with a non-white).  White females are not supposed to be pro-life.  White females are not supposed to acknowledge or support a woman who chooses to stay at home and raise a family.  White females are not supposed to show resentment at how her neighborhood and surroundings have changed due to &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  These memes are supposedly upheld my white men only, and that is what you are taught.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a white male, and after reading a lot of these posts, I am glad to know that a lot of white women feel the same way we white men do in these times.  Everytime the liberal media depicts an angry white person, that person is always a man.  And they make him out to look like an intolerant racist redneck bigot.  It&rsquo;s nice to know it&rsquo;s not just us men that are affected by these anti-white atrocities.</p>
