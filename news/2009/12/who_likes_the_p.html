			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Terence P. Jeffrey, Washington Times, December 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Each Monday, Gallup publishes a demographic breakdown of the president&rsquo;s approval rating among the people it has surveyed during the previous seven-day period.</p>
<p>For the week of Dec. 7-13, Mr. Obama&rsquo;s overall approval was 49 percent, with some groups rating him significantly higher than that and some rating him significantly lower. Among people who seldom or never go to church, Mr. Obama did relatively well. Fifty-three percent said they approved of the job he is doing. Among those who go to church monthly or nearly weekly, 53 percent approved. But among weekly churchgoers, only 42 percent approved.</p>
<p>If there were not a class of citizens in this country who go to church every week, a majority of Americans would still approve of the job Mr. Obama is doing.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama also did very well among the unmarried. Fifty-nine percent approved of the job he is doing. Among married people, however, only 42 percent approved.</p>
<p>If marriage could be eliminated in this country  &mdash;  leaving only the never married, the divorced and the cohabitating  &mdash;  a majority of Americans would still approve of the job Mr. Obama is doing.</p>
<p>Similarly, younger people were far more likely than older people to give Mr. Obama a positive rating. Fifty-nine percent of Americans aged 18 to 29 said they approved of the job he is doing. But only 50 percent of those 30 to 49 approved, only 48 percent of those 50 to 64 approved, and only 40 percent of those 65 or older approved.</p>
<p>If everyone in this country were under 30, a majority of Americans would still approve of the job Mr. Obama is doing.</p>
<p>When income brackets were considered, Mr. Obama did best among the poorest. Fifty-six percent of those who earn less than $24,000 per year, and 53 percent of those who earn between $24,000 and $60,000, approved of the job he is doing. But only 49 percent of those who earn between $60,000 and $90,000 per year approved, and only 44 percent of those who earn more than $90,000 per year approved.</p>
<p>If no one earned more than $60,000 per year in this nation, a majority of Americans would still approve of the job Mr. Obama is doing.</p>
<p>Is there a lesson in this Gallup poll? Yes. The people who form the backbone of our society  &mdash;  the married, churchgoing, hard-working, experienced members of our national community  &mdash;  do not believe what Mr. Obama is doing today as president serves their interests.</p>

		<p>I think that marital status, income and age are all legerdemain.  The best explanation is race.  Blacks still approve of him in almost the same number they did when he was elected, while white approval across the age groups are slipping.  It is because many blacks are unmarried, young and low income that those groups &#8220;seem&#8221; to support the President more.</p>

<p>How very odd that this article neglects to examine the most prominent group divide in the poll numbers   &mdash;   race.  It would be just too embarrassing to admit that blacks will <i>always</i> vote in landslide numbers for another black.</p>
<p>After all, if news like that were to become widespread, it might encourage Whites to do the same thing.  And we can&rsquo;t have that, now, can we?<br/>

		<p>If given a choice blacks will ALWAYS vote for a black. The same with Mexicans, Asians, Arabs, etc. It is only Whites who have the stupid idea that voting for a nonwhite makes them more &#8220;righteous&#8221; somehow. Notice how they get that &#8220;look&#8221; on their faces when they &#8220;proudly&#8221; say they voted for the black man, etc?  Talk about a bunch of fools who really don&rsquo;t know how ignorant they really look to the rest of us. </p>

		<p>Rasmussen did a poll recently where they found that like 3/4 of the population were at least somewhat angry at the government&hellip;.but almost HALF were EXTREMELY angry.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s approval rating is manufactured propaganda.  I don&rsquo;t know a single person who wouldn&rsquo;t be very happy if he was dragged off in chains, let alone impeached.</p>
<p>And the area I live in is one of the most liberal in the nation.</p>

		<p>The community organizing Messiah&rsquo;s ratings take age into consideration but run mostly according the race.  Blacks at 91% and whites at 39% and all those people in the 39 range are probably racists according to the blacks.<br/>
 The Messiah obviously thinks he knows much better than the Founders of America.  The Founders approach featured limited government and Ameritocracy.  There were no limitations except your intelligence, drive and ability.  In Obama approach,the workers and producers have to share their hard earned bounty with the dead beats who refuse to work and produce.  The is called redistribution of the wealth.  This half-baked narcissist believes he has all the answers but is actually completely over his head in what is probably the world&rsquo;s most important job.  <br/>
We can only hope that most of his democratic lap dogs will be defeated in 2010 before another monstrosity like the Obama healthcare bill can be passed.  We know Obama&rsquo;s also pushing for Cap and Tax and amnesty.  This guy has to be stopped!</p>

		<p>my apologies for no cap&rsquo;s or certain punctuation d/t broken keyboard.</p>
<p>this is a no-brainer. blacks overwhelmingly voted for obama - and would do so again - no matter how dangerous and disasterous his performance. to the majority of them, race is much, much more important than the welfare of the country. many, perhaps even a majority of them would be perfectly happy to see america go down&hellip;partly as &#8221;payback&#8221; to whitey for creating such a &#8216;unfair&rsquo; and racist country. to them, it would be sweet revenge. <br/>
i will go so far as to say this&hellip;.most blacks are not even patriotic in the least and do not feel part of the success of our country. in my opinion most would even take some sort of satisfaction in its destruction.<br/>
this is the conclusion i have reached in my 57 years and in living and working around them the vast majority of my life in a state that is over 1/3 black. <br/>
one like myself must come to his/her own conclusions. the media simply refuses to even speculate about such subjects as these.</p>

		<p>In my not-so-humble opinion, the people who approve of Obama most have the most to gain and the least to lose from his neo-communist agenda. After all, Big Government&rsquo;s goal is to become an erzatz (however it&rsquo;s spelled) church and family, as well as the source of one&rsquo;s physical, intellectual, and spiritual support. </p>
<p>Interestingly, a key reason for communism&rsquo;s failure is that it assumed that the idea of racial and ethnic differences was created by the bourgeoisie to distract the proletariat from their plight of economic exploitation. It was also assumed that after communism was implemented in a given society, people would identify with themselves and each other as proletarians and forget about race and ethnicity. As it turned out, race and ethnicity trumped class and the whole idea of universal proletarian solidarity. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Obama administration is socialist, pure and simple. Even worse, this administration is mixing communism with ethnic nationalism, which makes for an even worse situation.</p>
<p>Just some random thoughts.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t fall for this propaganda folks. Sure no one likes the job Obama is doing but the money to get him elected in the first place didn&rsquo;t come from poor uneducated, single people under 30 years of age. There were big bucks from some very high places that put Obama in office and when they buy a candidate he stays bought and he is dancing to their tune. </p>
<p>There are some people that are very happy with Obama because this was all well planned. </p>

<p>Great!  The trendies in this poll are seemingly unaware that they are getting hammered most by this administration.  Young Whites who give Obama high marks are absolute fools. </p>
<p>Here are some things planned for them: </p>
<p>1.  forced health insurance at a cost much higher than any other group, including a possible jail sentence and fine for non-compliance.</p>
<p>2.  increased affirmative action favoring those of a more acceptable and darker hue, all with the approval of the supreme dorks.   </p>
<p>3. more sectioned-8 communities due to vigorous efforts to cover those &#8220;traditionally left out&#8221;.  </p>
<p>4. lowered wages driven down by sainted illegals from Mexico who will at least receive de facto amnesty. </p>
<p>5. crowded and unsafe public schools in which their kids will be taught praises to Obama and the glories of the third world, and Islam.  </p>
<p>6. restrictions on free speech and the internet </p>
<p>7. renewed attacks on the second amendment</p>
<p>8. increased taxes to pay for it all</p>
<p>The young whites who swooned over the election of this nightmare have gotten nothing, and will get nothing but the shaft, and:  </p>
<p>1. Gitmo is still open</p>
<p>2. Nothing has been done on global warming (a hoax anyway)</p>
<p>3. Two wars are still going on</p>
<p>4. Unemployment over ten percent</p>
<p>5. Jihadist trials coming to town</p>
<p>6. Jihadist coming to your prisons</p>
<p>7. Foreclosures continue</p>
<p>These are just a few things. </p>
<p>There are consequences to watching too many ballgames, glorifying too many &#8220;aphleaks&#8221;,  drinking too much beer, smoking too much dope, listening to too much ghetto &#8220;music&#8221;, and taking seriously too many communist professors. </p>

		<p>Anon&rsquo;s comment about white youth is seconded. Those that have spent any amount of time around blacks and Hispanics see them through the goggles of Reality. Don&rsquo;t count us out just yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m young, unmarried, white, and &#8220;unchurched&#8221; in all religious cults (read: atheist). Exactly what does being &#8220;churched&#8221; have to do with the backbone of society? Since when did being a member of some religious sect have anything to do with being a decent member of society? Last I checked, The least religious are the ones that stay out of prisons&hellip;</p>

		<p>There is a growing list of people who voted for him and don&rsquo;t like him.  Some people were under the impression that Obama was not an elite hand puppet like Bush or McCain.  Sadly their illusions have been shattered.  Seven years and counting with this nation involved in Middle Eastern wars and no end in sight.  Fifty thousand soldiers will remain in Iraq as &#8220;technical advisors&#8221;.  The promises of bringing the troops home were lies and they&rsquo;ll stay there as long as he&rsquo;s in office.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t go to church, I am unemployed, I am 30 and I hate Obama. But then again, I hate politicians in general regardless of race or political affiliation. I even was weary of voting for Chuck Baldwin because he is so religious, but he was a lesser of the evils of Obama and McCain.</p>

		<p>I live in a rural area near Houston and work for a small technology company with about 75 employees. The company is 100 percent white. Nearly everyone has a fair complexion, blue eyes, and light colored hair. Everyone has at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from a real college and most have master&rsquo;s degrees. Everyone comes to work on time and does a great job.</p>
<p>Indeed, we&rsquo;re a very happy group with good relations. I thank God each day that I can work in a clean, safe enviornment with high quality people.</p>
<p>Everyone in the office is very conservative in their dress and behavior. I was stunned last year to find out that several of my younger colleages from New England are hard-core Democrats and identify as Liberals. I never would have guessed it because we speak often and they hold my conservative views on crime, minorities, social problems related to race, etc. Yet, each one voted for Obama! WTH?!?!?!</p>
<p>I began to think about this and tried to determine why they would never vote for anyone other than a Liberal Democrat. I learned that it is because they were reared by families with strong pro-union ties. That&rsquo;s all they know! To them, Democrats favor unions and that is the bottom line. Likewise, Republicans are their bitter anti-union enemies. </p>
<p>To them, one&rsquo;s position on unions is something that transcends even race! Of course, if New Englanders were reared around a higher percentage of Blacks, they would have a far different view!</p>
<p>I strongly suspect that many otherwise conservative Whites in New England vote exclusively democratic for the same reason.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, I will never vote for a Republican as long as they opt to have a token Black as their party chairman or as long as they attempt to expand their &#8220;umbrella&#8221; to other races. I didn&rsquo;t vote for McShame and I will not send one dime to the RNC until they come out in support of their base of support; Whites! I won&rsquo;t hold my breath!</p>

		<p>I think the breakdown is wrong.  I see it this way:</p>
<p>The following are Obama voters:<br/>
Blacks, the lazy, liberals who never had to live around blacks, young people who want to be seen as progressive and intelligent but have never lived around blacks, and the hardcore &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care who it is as long as their democrats&#8221;, and those who have been indoctrinated with &#8220;white guilt&#8221; will vote for Obama.</p>
<p>The following detest him:<br/>
Christians, taxpayers, people who believe in morals, people with ethics, intelligent people, people who work for a living, people who believe in personal responsibility, gun owners, those who don&rsquo;t kill babies, and all those who spend their time working to take care of their families and end up filling the great public trough where the minorities feed.</p>

<p>Annie, I disconnected my television service about six months ago. My only regret is that I didn&rsquo;t do it years ago. I do not miss it one bit. I replaced television with books and exercise. I&rsquo;m better for it.</p>
<p>Besides, the joy I receive when tearing up the pleading letters from DirectTV and Comcast to resubscribe is much more gratifying than any of the nonsense on television. :-)</p>
<p>Of course, I still own one TV and I have it connected to my commputer, which contains a large library of my favorite movies of all time. I can watch those commercial-free whenever I choose.</p>
<p>So, please try it! Disconnect today! When DirectTV and Comcast come calling to win you back, tell them that the volume of diversity and multiculturalism they were piping to you was disgusting and very disturbing. Be sincere when you say it. I said it and I was sincere. It&rsquo;s amusing to listen to their plastic-smile response when hearing something so bold and enlightening.</p>
<p>Who knows? You may actually reach someone, intellectually.</p>

		<p>I see Obama as a sign of the continuing collapse of America and its conversion to a memberof a rising borderless, one world government, with capitalists and communists agreeing to play a complimentary game rather than the old model of staganant confrontation. I think that this is practically inevitable because they play off the factions, one of which Amren represents, so well.  It is practically automatic.  What I really bemoan is having to watch the social results, and Amren does a great job documenting it.  I also think that when everyone suddenly wakes up one day and understands that the emperor has no clothes, the world economy will collapse and chaos will ensue worldwide.  I may be wrong, but I think that the pressure of population rather guarantees it, as does the greed and selfishness of humans in general.</p>
<p>Unchurched, eh?  I have read other posts on Christian sites - entire sites that praise Obama.  If you are really a Christian, then you must believe we are in the Last Days, so why worry about Obama?  You&rsquo;re going to a better place, so what&rsquo;s keeping you here?  I have always noticed, among other hypocrisies, that Christians (at least today&rsquo;s) are more afraid of dying than anyone.  Philosophically, this indicates that they don&rsquo;t believe their own doctrines. Early Christians had to be ordered by the church leaders, who made it doctrinal in the second century to cease suicidal activities such as charges at Roman military authorities, etc., so great was their faith.  The &#8220;churched&#8221; who think they wear the laurels of Western achievement lack the education to realize that it has always been the mavericks, the nominally Christian, and the outright rebels who have advanced the white race.  If all non-whites suddenly disappeared, the white race with no one but &#8220;churched&#8221; members would quickly disintegrate into warring factions, and tear themselves apart,as they always did.  If the &#8220;churched&#8221; had been able to maintain its hold through Western history, we would still live on a flat earth and be illiterate.  It is the whites who have the courage to self-examine, criticize the establishment,and search for better answers that have always been the ones who advanced the West, often forcing the &#8220;churched&#8221; to modify.  They are the true hope, not superstitious, self righteous, other hating, &#8220;churched&#8221; whites.</p>
