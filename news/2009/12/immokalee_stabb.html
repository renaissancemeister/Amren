<h1>Immokalee Stabbing Shows Another Side of Immigration Debate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brent Batten, Naples News, Dec. 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[N]o sooner than does a series of articles about the Collier County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office program to deport troublesome illegal aliens conclude than an illegal alien is in the headlines, and not in a good way.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[A]long comes Mauricio Escalante. The 33-year-old illegal immigrant was arrested Saturday for stabbing to death a 17-year-old on the streets of Immokalee.</p>
<p>The teenager&rsquo;s affront that set off the fatal confrontation  &mdash;  daring to speak English in America.</p>
<p>According to Sheriff&rsquo;s Office reports, around 3 a.m. Saturday Charlie Guzman and some friends gathered at the laundry of an apartment complex on Colorado Avenue. Three others, including Escalante, were already there and the two groups began talking until a dispute erupted over the victim&rsquo;s group speaking English, not Spanish.</p>
<p>Escalante went to a nearby apartment, got a knife, and fatally stabbed Guzman, according to reports.</p>
<p>So much for the notion that illegal immigrants are universally a hard-working, law abiding set committed to doing the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do, all while trying to assimilate.</p>
<p>While plenty of people in the community of illegal immigrants, a majority, no doubt, fit that description, there are bad actors in the group.</p>
<p>The bad actors are the ones targeted by the sheriff&rsquo;s program. For proof of that, one need look no further than Escalante. A year ago, he wound up in jail because deputies found him so drunk he was deemed to be a threat to himself or others.</p>
<p>But being drunk out of your mind in public isn&rsquo;t the sort of thing that gets you deported under the sheriff&rsquo;s system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until the murder, he didn&rsquo;t have a criminal history with us,&#8221; Sheriff&rsquo;s Office spokeswoman Karie Partington said.</p>
<p>In two years, about 2,200 illegal immigrants have been either deported or are awaiting deportation through the sheriff&rsquo;s efforts. Among that many cases, there are bound to be a few where the triggering offenses seem minor or the hardship upon family members here legally seems great.</p>
<p>But there are hardships to be borne by turning a blind eye toward illegal immigrants among us.</p>

		<p>In case after case, the cop or the asst. DA will say that the perp did not have any priors, at least in this country. That they had not yet attracted the attention of the police points to the enormity of the problem. If you flood the country with pit bulls, you can bet that more than one will have a vicious streak. </p>
<p>There will be no condemnation of Mauricio Escalante, the &#8220;immigrant&#8221; of indeterminate legal standing, by La Raza. Instead, both Escalante and the 17-year old will be portrayed as victims of the White man. </p>

		<p>I do think that there are hopelessly stupid people in every race and class, and this Escalante creature is one of them.  I pray they throw the book at him, and keep him off the streets forever.  We have enough of our own trash; we don&rsquo;t need it from other countries.</p>

		<p>The question people should be asking is WHY.</p>
<p>Why is speaking the native language of a country you have entered a reason to be killed?</p>
<p>The answer is the people who enter our country are here as an enemy army.  They are here to conquer us.  Speaking english for the invaders is tantamount to treason.</p>
<p>That is why he was killed.</p>
<p>That Americans don&rsquo;t understand that these are not &#8220;immigrants&#8221; and not even &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221; but rather an army that has come to ethnically cleanse (and make no mistake, that is a euphemism for genocide) us from our own lands, speaks of a stupidity so monumental that it puts into question our very right to live.</p>
<p>Put another way, when their numbers grow to a certain size, they will declare war on us&hellip;.not small squirmishes against individuals and those who are vulnerable (that can be denied as &#8220;crime&#8221;)&hellip;but large scale fighting.  This is an ARMY being moved into position.</p>
<p>And whether or not your friends, your neighbors, let alone you government, will fight back, when they come to wipe us all out, is very much in doubt.</p>

		<p>This aspect of the invasion is always overlooked.  We are indoctrinated daily by the controlled media that to even believe our culture is superior constitutes racism and speaking such is a hate crime.  This refuse that we allow among us is drawing down the curtain on a once beautiful and free country.  </p>
<p>By the way, our President even announced that we are no longer a Christian country.  He is an example of what open borders can do to degrade a culture.  His IQ is never bandied about because I suspect it is average at best yet he received a free ride through schools while many qualified whites had to step aside.  </p>

<p>Obama admitted to goofing off in his last two yrs of HS at Punahou, doing drugs, ditching classes.  Yet, he still was somehow able to graduate.  And that &#8220;stellar&#8221; prep school record was enough to gain admission to Oxy, one of the very &#8220;best&#8221; (so to speak) liberal arts colleges on the West Coast.  His academic record at Oxy wasn&rsquo;t great, but he was able to transfer to Columbia, an Ivy.  And his time at Columbia wasn&rsquo;t stellar, but still got admitted to Harvard Law.  He was only picked editor of the Law Review b/c frustrated conservative law students at Harvard thought he was the lesser of many evils.  </p>
<p>Time and again, affirmative action bailed him out.</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.  I&rsquo;m guessing about 110.  </p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t refuse to release his school records if he were proud of them.</p>
<p>Too, I think these birthers have a point:  Obama is paying millions in attorney fees to fight the charges he is not a citizen.  Why not show his original birth certificate and be done with it?  There&rsquo;s nothing to lose and everything to gain IF IT IS VALID.</p>
<p>Those who defend his position by claiming it won&rsquo;t stop the suits against him, because the conspiracy theorists won&rsquo;t find anything he shows them acceptable, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>Everything about this guy is suspect.  As Glenn Beck said on one of his shows, he&rsquo;s a racist, and the psychiatrist there nodded his head in agreement and said he has some &#8220;issues with white people,&#8221; or words to that effect.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true! our &#8220;spanish&#8221; speaking people here on my camp which is a NATO camp with Spanish, Italian and Slovenian troops, do not understand the real SPANISH speakers. Real Spanish from real Spaniards sounds quite a lot like Italian.</p>

		<p>This wretch killed a man young enough to be his son. And he had time to reflect while he went back to get the knife, but still went on to kill. To civilized people, that shows a depraved mind. This kind of mentality is not so very exceptional in their culture. It&rsquo;s just somewhat darker. Recently there was a story about a stabbing murder in NYC. It was the result of an argument over a woman. The killer&rsquo;s comment was basically that when you wake up in the morning, you never know what&rsquo;s going to happen to you that day. But that&rsquo;s life, he said.  <br>
There are people for whom &#8216;life&rsquo; includes the possibility of committing murder. And we are supposed to accept them as just like us.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time when this hate and imperialism is directed at non-Spanish speaking, non-hispanics. These hispanic imperialists are every bit as bad as Islamic jihadists in their quest to have everyone do as they say. But, they first have to get their fellow hispanics on board, before they start looking outward. This killing was part of that process.</p>

<p>How can you possibly be considered &#8220;law-abiding&#8221; when the first thing you do is knowingly enter this country illegally. For a lot of these people that is just the first criminal act in their new criminal career in America.</p>

<p>Guzman is an Hispanic name originating from the a Germanic people, the Visigoths (Western Goths), who ruled Spain after the fall of the Roman Empire until 711 A.D. when the Peninsula was invaded by Muslim armies. A war of reconquest lasted until 1492 when Fernando and Isabel united the various kingdoms and expelled the invaders from Spain.</p>
<p>Many Spanish surnames have Germanic origins; Guzman being one of them along with Rodriguez, Gonazalez etc. The Spanish word for cheese &#8220;queso&#8221; (KEH-so) also has Germanic origins.  The modern German word for cheese is KASE (KAY-zeh).<br>
As an aside, It&rsquo;s interesting that the Christian Kings of Spain fought for 400 years to reconquer their country from Muslims and now are standing by while Muslims are conquering it again with harly a shot being fired.</p>

		<p>I may be wrong, but stabbing a minor to death because one doesn&rsquo;t approve of him speaking English doesn&rsquo;t seem like a really good idea in the Southeast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to read his eventual explanation about how he didn&rsquo;t have time to premeditate while he walked to get the knife and then back to the victim with it.</p>

<p>You wrote: &#8220;I think you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m guessing about 110&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>To be honest, I think you might be a bit too generous.</p>
<p>There seems to be such a fascination, even in popular culture, with the notion of IQ, while not that many people know what an &#8220;intellectual quotient&#8221; is. I&rsquo;m not saying you don&rsquo;t know what it is, but I wish there was less of a distorsion in people&rsquo;s minds about what it actually is: a statistical result.</p>
<p>But by the way, an IQ of 110 is actually pretty okay. I mean, sure, one can talk about people with an IQ of 140&hellip; But did you know that about one person in close to a million, in the US and other industrialised cuntries, has an IQ like that?</p>
<p>Some people actually think that Pamela Anderson is a genius, with an IQ of 160 or so&hellip; I read somewhere that Arnold Schwarzenegger has an IQ of 140&hellip; I won&rsquo;t even comment.</p>
<p>Now, back to our dear friend Barack: if it is true that the average IQ, or the average result to standardized IQ tests for Blacks in America is 85, what are the odds of a Mister Affirmation Action such as Handsome Barry, whose success has very little to do with his abilities, having an IQ, nothing less than 25 points above the average of his own group?</p>

		<p>Stories like this only prove my long-held convictions. Those who dishonor our laws are not above any crime. The rob, rape, molest,abuse,cheat,steal and murder. I know we&rsquo;re all created equal, but somewhere along the way, they lose their humanity and become animals. If they are not deported, we will soon have a nation filled with them and we will no longer be the country we were meant to be. Keep fighting until Washington hears us and gets rid of each and every one. They are not the only danger, however. We thought we only had illegal aliens to fight, but the level of terrorism grows each day. And, those who took oaths to protect and defend, must have had their fingers crossed!</p>

		<p>Anonymous goes too far in defending Obama, and in a roundabout way trying to smear those who don&rsquo;t like him as anti-Semites as well as racists. The fact is that those who went to school with Obama say he was no bright light as a student, very very average. The fact that he was identified as a useful tool by the people in charge says a lot. Among other things it says they could possibly have pulled strings to have him pass the bar. While this probably didn&rsquo;t happen, it isn&rsquo;t out of the realm of possibility that it might have. </p>
<p>Francois, a 140 IQ occurs in about 1 out of 400 people in the general population, not 1 out of a million. Obama&rsquo;s IQ is estimated at 120. </p>

		<p>Poster #7 is correct.  Most latinos do not speak standard Spanish.  In the school I work at, which is 100% latino, the big problem the spanish teachers have is that most of the students canot read or write proper spanish.  (We have a spanish class under the theory that if they improve in their own language, they will improve in every subject.  Or it&rsquo;s an easy credit, date your pick.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny having so many kids from so many different Spanish speaking countries.  (The majority of them are actually very nice kids and I feel for sorry for them for what their parents did to them by bringing them here illegally.)  It happens often that when one kid says something in &#8220;Spanish,&#8221; another kids asks him what word he said, because he doesn&rsquo;t recognize it.</p>
<p>When I look out at the sea of faces of white, black, brown and Indian &#8220;Latino&#8221; faces, I just think that in their home countries, these different racial groups would not give each other the time of day.  But here, they are all united as &#8220;Latinos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny thing is, they only befriend or date people of their same skin tone.  Latino counts for nothing when it comes to relationships and friendships.  I wish this would be brought up more on a national level.  &#8220;Latinos&#8221; are not a united &#8220;people&#8221; but many various races and combinations of races with as much classism and racism as anybody else.  </p>
<p>Perhaps if we could skim off the white Latinos and lighter mestizos we would have the chance to remain numerically superior for a time.  </p>

		<p>6 j stuart, 9 ice, 18 Francois, and 20 Anon: There are, of course, people who know BHO&rsquo;s SAT scores, his IQ, and his school records.  I have read that one of them let it out that his IQ was 124, but then the story disappeared.  I think 124 is plausible.  He is, after all, the son of one of the brightest young men in Africa, and a foolish but smart White woman.  As 20 Anon says, he did pass a bar exam.  An IQ of 124 is good enough to be a lawyer, a doctor, a engineer, or a president, but probably not to excel at any of them.  <br>
     I think the reason that all these scores are concealed is that his handlers want people to believe that he&rsquo;s not merely smart, but positively brilliant.  Even White liberals, for the most part, know that Blacks are dullards, though they admit the fact only in their choices of where to live and send their kids to school.  For Whites to buy into the Obama fantasy, they have to be convinced that he&rsquo;s the real thing, the capable Black they see on TV, with a lovely wife and two bright little girls.  Look how Tiger Woods has fallen.  It&rsquo;s not because he cheats on his wife, lots of celebrities do that, it&rsquo;s because his public image was shown to be false.  If BHO is conclusively demonstrated to be no smarter than a traffic court judge, his standing drops, a lot.  If he&rsquo;s not brilliant, then who&rsquo;s writing what appears on his teleprompter?  Who put him in the White House?  What are the real roles of Bernanke, Geithner, and Summers, all of whom are extremely sharp?  <br>
     BHO&rsquo;s handlers apparently have had their underlings let on that he&rsquo;s ultra-capable, just as a rock star&rsquo;s publicist will encourage flattering rumors, but nobody in an official capacity has announced any such thing.  This allows the gullible to be persuaded that BHO is here to save them, yet lets him off the hook if the truth comes out.  &#8220;I never said I was a genius&#8221;, he can say.  But he and his controllers have let others say it, and not corrected them, because the story serves them well.    </p>

		<p>20 Anon: Hispanics in America speak lousy Spanish, which is why they can&rsquo;t even do well in Spanish classes.  It&rsquo;s really frustrating to the Spanish teachers at my school when the White kids get better grades than the Mexicans who hear their mamas speak Spanish every day.  I suppose it&rsquo;s all part of the Hispanics&rsquo; cultural tradition of indifference to formal education.  </p>

20 Anon: Hispanics in America speak lousy Spanish, which is why they can&rsquo;t even do well in Spanish classes. It&rsquo;s really frustrating to the Spanish teachers at my school when the White kids get better grades than the Mexicans who hear their mamas speak Spanish every day. I suppose it&rsquo;s all part of the Hispanics&rsquo; cultural tradition of indifference to formal education. </p>
<p>Schoolteacher,</p>
<p>As a Spanish teacher I can agree with what you say. We began a program called Español para Hispanohablantes several years ago due to the vast numbers of Hispanic kids who took Spanish thinking that it would be an easy A. In that class they learn the grammar and culture and read literature/poetry by Cervantes, Lorca, Neruda, García Marquez and others.<br>
  They were a royal PITA in the traditional classes. Interrupting with declarations such as &#8221; That&rsquo;s not the way WE say that!&#8221;, and other general annoyances. Their Spanish is mostly a Patois. A colleague of mine who is Colombian admitted to me one day that she has trouble understanding some of the Carribeans. <br>
The kids are interviewed as entering Freshman and if they come from Spanish speaking homes they either take the Hispanohablantes class, French or German.<br>
