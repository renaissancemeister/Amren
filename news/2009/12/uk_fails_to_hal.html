			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nina Lakhani, Independent (London), December 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of British schoolgirls are facing the terrifying prospect of female genital mutilation (FGM) over the Christmas holidays as experts warn the practice continues to flourish across the country. Parents typically take their daughters back to their country of origin for FGM during school holidays, but The Independent on Sunday has been told that &#8220;cutters&#8221; are being flown to the UK to carry out the mutilation at &#8220;parties&#8221; involving up to 20 girls to save money.</p>
<p>The police face growing criticism for failing to prosecute a single person for carrying out FGM in 25 years; new legislation from 2003 which prohibits taking a girl overseas for FGM has also failed to secure a conviction.</p>
<p>Experts say the lack of convictions, combined with the Government&rsquo;s failure to invest enough money in education and prevention strategies, mean the practice continues to thrive. Knowledge of the health risks and of the legislation remains patchy among practising communities, while beliefs about the supposed benefits for girls remain firm, according to research by the Foundation for Women&rsquo;s Health, Research and Development (Forward).</p>
<p>As a result, specialist doctors and midwives are struggling to cope with increasing numbers of women suffering from long-term health problems, including complications during pregnancy and childbirth.</p>
<p>Campaigners are urging ministers to take co-ordinated steps to work with communities here and overseas to change deep-seated cultural attitudes and stamp out this extreme form of violence against women.</p>
<p>The author and life peer Ruth Rendell, who has campaigned against FGM for 10 years, said: &#8220;When I helped take the Bill through Parliament seven years ago, I was very hopeful that we&rsquo;d get convictions and that would then act as a deterrent for other people. But that has never happened and my heart bleeds for these girls. This mutilation is forever; nothing can be done to restore the clitoris, and that is just very sad for them. I have repeatedly asked questions of ministers from all departments about why there has never been a prosecution and why we still do not have a register of cases. But while they are always very sympathetic, nothing ever seems to get done. Teachers must not be squeamish and must talk to their girls so we can try and prevent it from happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>FGM is classified into four types, of varying severity; type 3 is the most mutilating and involves total removal of the clitoris, labia and a narrowing of the whole vagina.</p>
<p>An estimated 70,000 women living in the UK have undergone FGM, and 20,000 girls remain at risk, according to Forward. The practice is common in 28 African countries, including Somalia, Sudan and Nigeria, as well as some Middle Eastern and Asian countries such as Malaysia and Yemen. It is generally considered to be an essential rite of passage to suppress sexual pleasure, preserve girls&rsquo; purity and cleanliness, and is necessary for marriage in many communities even now. It has no religious significance.</p>
<p>The most common age for the procedure is between eight and 11 but it can be carried out just after birth or just before marriage. It carries the risk of death from bleeding or tetanus, and long-term problems include urinary incontinence, recurrent infections and chronic pain. Reversal procedures are necessary in order to avoid major problems for a woman and baby during childbirth.</p>
<p>In the UK, some women have to travel hundreds of miles to one of 15 specialist clinics because services and training are so patchy. There are no specialist clinics at all in Scotland, or Wales, and student doctors, midwives and social workers are not routinely taught to recognise or deal with FGM.</p>
<p>A DVD, paid for by Baroness Rendell, which shows health workers how to reverse FGM will be launched in January. She hopes the next generation of health professionals will be better equipped to help affected women, many of whom suffer from long-term psychological effects such as flashbacks, anxiety and nightmares.</p>
<p>Amina, 55, originally from Somalia, underwent type 3 FGM, with no anaesthetic, when she was 11. One of the lucky ones, she suffered no long-term physical health problems but still carries psychological scars.</p>
<p>She has been vilified by practising communities for campaigning against FGM and for refusing to allow four of her daughters to be mutilated; the fifth suffered the procedure while in the care of her grandmother. The government funding that allowed Amina to work with families in Yorkshire, going door to door, to schools and community centres, talking about legal and health risks, ran out in March.</p>
<p>The Somali model Waris Dirie was mutilated at the age of five. She set up the Waris Dirie Foundation in 2002 to help eradicate FGM. She said: &#8220;I am worried about the situation in Europe and the US, as FGM seems to be on the rise in these places. In the 21st century, a crime this cruel should not be accepted in a society as developed as England. No one can undo the trauma that is caused by this horrible crime; it stays in your head for ever. So what we should focus on is that there won&rsquo;t be another victim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackie Mathers, a nurse from the Bristol Safeguarding Children Board, said: &#8220;These families do not do this out of spite or hatred; they believe this will give their daughters the best opportunities in life. We would like a conviction, not against the parents, but against a cutter, someone who makes a living from this. We have anecdotal information that the credit crunch means people can&rsquo;t go home, so they&rsquo;re getting cutters over for &#8216;FGM parties&rsquo;. It is hard for people to speak out because they are from communities that are already vilified as asylum seekers, so to stand up against their communities is to risk being ostracised. But we have to empower girls and women to address this, along with teachers, school nurses and social workers. We can&rsquo;t ignore it; it is mutilation.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said: &#8220;We have appointed an FGM co-ordinator to drive forward a co-ordinated government response to this appalling crime and make recommendations for future work.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The answer is simple.  The UK can&rsquo;t halt FGM, because doing so would be racist, and insensitive to the official religion of the Labour Party.</p>

		<p>The solution is simple. Send all the Muslims back where they belong in their own countries. BTW, what is with calling these immigrants &#8220;British schoolgirls&#8221;??? They are no more British than the man in the moon.</p>

<p>It is important to point that out to ease the worried minds of the loyal multiculturalists. </p>
<p>If it was a sacred Muslim ritual then I am sure it would be encouraged and celebrated, covered by the the national healthcare service, and most likely adopted by liberal non-muslim families wanting to appear non racist. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the problem: presumably, if Brits considered these girls to be fellow Brits, they would interfere.  At least I&rsquo;d like to think so.  It&rsquo;s really horrible to imagine white folks shrugging their shoulders at this kind of brutality happening in their own neighborhoods.   Civilized humans don&rsquo;t even treat animals that way.</p>

		<p>Why DON&rsquo;T you want convictions against the parents/guardians - the ones responsible for the girls???  They should be put away forever, since the girls so mutilated will suffer the results forever!  By all means, get the cutters, too, and put THEM away forever as well; but if the parents are routinely nailed and severely punished, I&rsquo;m quite sure the practice would diminish.  For this issue, I think the UK should import caners from Singapore, and cane the flesh off the parents and cutters alike.</p>

Wrong.<br>
 FGM is a hiddeous mutilation of a girl&rsquo;s genitals&hellip;essentailly, castration. Ghastly, cruel, twisted, pure unmitigated evil. How&rsquo;d ya&rsquo; feel if someone took a knife and lopped off your daughter&rsquo;s clitoris and her labia, and sewed her vagina shut? How would you feel if you met a lovely woman and fell in love with her, and then found out some satanic creep had mangled her this way? You&rsquo;d be sickened, and mad beyond measure, saddened to the core.<br>
This is more gruesome than any scene in the worst horror movie.<br>
Only Amnimals could do this. I stand by my comment. I am utterly adamant that this is beyond barbarism. (BTW, where the hell are American liberals and feministas here? Answer: they don&rsquo;t even know of the practice. Also, they&rsquo;d deny it was really happening. Also, they&rsquo;d simply blame it on men, not Islam, or African barbarism).<br>
No, if whirtes did it, they&rsquo;d be facing life in prison&hellip;and should be put to death, because the mutillation is worse than murder.<br>
But hey, isn&rsquo;t multiculturalism great? All hail the MSM that hides this barbarism! All hail Lord Obama, bringer of love and peace!<br>
All hail the coming age of love and peace, where Islamists lop off heads in our streets, stone women to death, and hack up girl&rsquo;s privates!<br>
Sick! (Attention: This is IRONY).<br>
We have inherited an insane world, mad beyond repair, and evil.</p>

		<p>The story in the &#8216;Independent&rsquo; is misleading in one detail; the only people in Malaysia or Indonesia to go in for FGM are those of Yemeni descent.</p>
<p>That feminist bossy-bore-for-all-seasons, Harriet Harperson, knows better than to make a bg public fuss about this practice; the Labour Party is desperate to hang onto every last Muslim vote if it possibly can.</p>

		<p>This custom is also commonly practiced among African Christians and animists.  I don&rsquo;t know where it came from, but it is a very old practice that was known in antiquity across Africa and Asia.</p>

		<p>I for one don&rsquo;t have a problem with non whites practicing FGM. It simply is not our concern. Our concern is bettering and improving the situation of our people. I think it is useful though to publicize and inform the public about the FGM issue if only to show how different non whites are to us culturally, and how savage they can be. </p>

		<p>This hideous practice really highlights the chasm between their so-called culture and western, democratic values and culture. They will never assimilate - that is a fantasy we must abandon.</p>
<p>What they intend is to transmogrify western society into a hellish copy of their own making. They have no regard for our laws, a fact they continually demonstrate, and sanctions only enrage them to commit greater outrages. They are the proverbial &#8220;enemy within.&#8221; It is folly to divide them into a moderate &#8220;good&#8221; and a radical/extremist bad side. The so-called moderate Muslims are complicent by their silence and passivity in the fact of the deeds of the so-called radicals and extremists. Muslims could themselves stop these practices. They do not, because they silently support them. When the time comes, they, the &#8220;moderates,&#8221; too will wage Jihad against the infidel. That would be us, folks.</p>
