			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New York Daily News, December 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When three white women were said to be romantically involved with [Tiger] Woods in addition to his blonde, Swedish wife, blogs, airwaves and barbershops started humming, and Woods&rsquo; already tenuous standing among many blacks took a beating.</p>
<p>On the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner radio show, Woods was the butt of jokes all week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully, Tiger, you didn&rsquo;t marry a black woman. Because if a sister caught you running around with a bunch of white hoochie-mamas,&#8221; one parody suggests in song, she would have castrated him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Grinch&rsquo;s Theme Song&#8221; didn&rsquo;t stop there: &#8220;The question everyone in America wants to ask you is, how many white women does one brother waaant?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The darts reflect blacks&rsquo; resistance to interracial romance. They also are a reflection of discomfort with a man who has smashed barriers in one of America&rsquo;s whitest sports and assumed the mantle of the world&rsquo;s most famous athlete, once worn by Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>But Woods has declined to identify himself as black, and famously chose the term &#8220;Cablinasian&#8221; (Caucasian, black, Indian and Asian) to describe the racial mixture he inherited from his African-American father and Thai mother.</p>
<p>This vexed some blacks, but it hasn&rsquo;t stopped them from claiming Woods as one of their own. Or from disapproving of his marriage to Elin Nordegren, despite blacks&rsquo; historical fight against white racist opponents of mixed marriage.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Ebonie Johnson Cooper doesn&rsquo;t care that Tiger Woods&rsquo; wife and alleged mistresses are white because Woods is &#8220;quote-unquote not really black.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But at the same time we still see him as a black man with a white woman, and it makes a difference,&#8221; said Johnson Cooper, a 26-year-old African-American from New York City. &#8220;There&rsquo;s just this preservation thing we have among one another. We like to see each other with each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve discussed this for years among black women,&#8221; said Denene Millner, author of several books on black relationships. &#8220;Why is it when they get to this level .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they tend to go directly for the nearest blonde?&#8221;</p>
<p>This tendency may be more prominent due to a relative lack of interracial marriages among average blacks. Although a recent Pew poll showed that 94 percent of blacks say it&rsquo;s all right for blacks and whites to date, a study published this year in Sociological Quarterly showed that blacks are less likely to actually date outside their race than are other groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The color of one&rsquo;s companion has long been a major measure of &#8220;blackness&#8221;  &mdash;  which is a big reason why the biracial Barack Obama was able to fend off early questions about his black authenticity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had Barack had a white wife, I would have thought twice about voting for him,&#8221; Johnson Cooper said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She [Carmen Van Kerckhove, founder of the race-meets-pop-culture blog Racialicious] claims that Asians don&rsquo;t fully embrace Woods, either.</p>

		<p>I think the observation that black men prefer blondes may be exaggerated.  </p>
<p>Look up the wives of black professional athletes.  Overwhelmingly black.  I think black men generally prefer black women but they often pursue white women as a power game.  They want to give a big FU to white guys.  </p>

		<p>Woods&rsquo; father is only half African American  &mdash;  making Woods less than 25% African.  Blacks hate him, because Woods is articulate, wealthy, talented, and (up until recently) had a positive image, but refuses to identify as black.  Blacks want to spuriously use Woods as another example of how all blacks could turn out without racism, but Woods wants nothing to do with his black cousins.  I wonder why? </p>

Even thought Mr. Woods has made it clear he&rsquo;s not blacks, blacks won&rsquo;t let him be anything but.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always nice to read blacks speaking candidly about race. It&rsquo;s too bad whites can&rsquo;t do the same without being vilified as racists.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that the vast majority of black men would love to date/marry an attractive white woman, or any white woman, for that matter.  What is surprising are the number of white women who want a black man.  No wonder white men gravitate to Asian women.  I am surprised, though, that Obama has been with Michelle for so long.  Seems uncharacteristic given his opportunities.</p>

<p>Baloney.  Absolute baloney.  Black women are as promiscuous as their male counterparts.  They have no moral qualms about adultery.  Black women EXPECT their men to be unfaithful.  Heck, since most of them have been in prison, they expect them to be engaging in all sorts of garbage.</p>
<p>How can anyone possibly help but LAUGH at this mock outrage when you consider the illegitamacy rate of black children.  When you consider the STD rate or the pregnancy rate or any other rate?  Black women defend their sons for raping white women.  They don&rsquo;t condemn them.</p>

		<p>Why do they go for the nearest Blonde?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that White women are far more attractive than Black women are.  It is also a bit of evolutionary psychology.  Blacks are improving their genetic line with Blonde White women.  It&rsquo;s also a way of sticking it to the White Man by taking his woman away from him.  The more of our women that Blacks and other races take away from us through miscegenation the closer we get to extinction as a race.  It&rsquo;s a way of destroying us.  Taking our genes and claiming them for their own and attributing the many positive qualities that they pick up from their White mother - claiming those qualities for their own race - this is &#8220;genetic theft&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s sole purpose is to better them and destroy us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why is it successful black men tend to go directly for the nearest blonde?&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re so much better looking than there own women.</p>
<p>Black women are insulted to the nth degree by 12% of black men who select races other than black.  The other 88% would do the same, but they can&rsquo;y get lucky.  Besides there&rsquo;s not enough white hookers or obese white women to go around.</p>
<p>One news story said Woods is indicating a pattern in that most or all of the women are cocktail waitresses or work in a bar.</p>
<p>I wonder how much he paid them.</p>

		<p>To all American readers here,</p>
<p>Please bear with me on this subject. I am Black youngster living in French Belgium and would like to point out that here in Europe things do not quite work the same way. Europeans simply are unable to conduct themselves like Americans do. The only Europeans able to do so are the Flemish peoples of Belgium and the Dutch(who are ancestors to the Afrikaans). Which is why it is quite normal to see successful non Europeans married to European women (Yannick Noah, English Blacks, Zinedine Zidane,Imran Khan, and even colored rugby players based in places such NZ and Australia). As to the question what these non whites were doing in Europe in the first place, well blame the game(immigration) not the players(people of colour born here).</p>
<p> America, if I am correct was founded on Puritan beliefs and segregation(as in separate but equal)but Europeans tend to show their love to any successful non white in the continent(be it fame, American style hygiene etc) Most Blacks living in Europe would pass for the &#8216;n word&rsquo; in the United States.</p>
<p>I am deeply saddened that Woods committed adultery, but I did not see anything wrong in the fact that he mated with a white woman.</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>P.S sorry for any grammatical errors, I am a Francophone.</p>

<p>Well, I agree with her sentiments whole-heartedly and I wish more white women her age thought like that. I think BM/WF unions upset black women more than they upset whites of either sex. Black women feel betrayed by brothas who chase after white women primarily because pickings in the mate department are already quite slim for them given that so many young black males live as &#8216;playas,&rsquo; are in jail, unemployed, etc. The thing that riles me is despite the many young, naive, poorly informed white women who fall for blacks these days most of us whites still respond coyly and indifferently to this problem (amren readers notwithstanding). I&rsquo;m sure if the average white adult with an unattached daughter had the same mindset as the typical black women in reagrds to BM/WF liasons, they would be a whole heck of a lot rarer than they are. </p>

<p>Laughably, one wonders if &ldquo;saint&rdquo; Tiger wasn&rsquo;t just targeting the easiest and most gullible &ldquo;ladies&rdquo;  in his world, brainwashed and trashy white women. Facing facts is very difficult for the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media (both black and white,) but truth be told Tiger Woods is not a handsome guy in the least. All the propaganda in the world cannot change this; he is just plain ugly even by black standards, with a smirking chipmunk face and bulging insectoid eyes. Add to this his openly dorky arrogance and smarmy inarticulateness, and one wonders if most attractive black or mulatto gold diggers aren&rsquo;t simply repulsed by him.</p>
<p>They, unlike their white counterparts after all, have the luxury of laughing in his face if he starts hinting that his all to likely clumsy come-ons are being rebuffed because of his racial background. </p>
<p>Just something to think about!</p>

		<p> Can you believe some of the blacks they quoted here? Interracial marriage is frowned on in the black community?! What a joke!</p>
<p> Go to any Wal-Mart or mall and notice how many black men you see walking with White women. It&rsquo;ll be plenty if my experience is any indication. In the town where I live, seeing a black man with a black woman will turn heads more quickly than seeing one with one of these stupid White girls   &mdash;   because it&rsquo;s very rare nowadays.</p>
<p> I think there&rsquo;s an unspoken consensus among black men: Impregnate as many White women as possible to help dilute the White race. </p>

		<p>This may be perhaps an unkind observation, but by and large black African women generally aren&rsquo;t physically attractive, at least facially, to any male, regardless of race.  Though there are certainly exceptions to this, that black men would find white females more attractive than women of their own race is hardly surprising.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a pecking order among the female species, of which the top two most attractive to most men are caucasians and East Asians.  Of course, this is just one man&rsquo;s opinion, but I suspect that it&rsquo;s fairly broadly held.</p>

		<p>Oh good grief!  I&rsquo;m seeing comments saying that Woods is only this or that percentage black.  The same arugments are made about Obama. This is nonsense.  Both are black.  If you won&rsquo;t believe your eyes to tell you they are black(and you should believe your eyes) then please read some books on genetics and on recessive vs. dominant genes.</p>
<p>It takes two white parents to produce a truly white child.  Any other combination produces a non-white child.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know why but when I see a German women with a non-German man (particularly non-European), it hurts me deeply. I&rsquo;m neither German, nor an European.</p>
<p>When I discuss with my fellow countrymen who are mostly over 40, I often hear that they are also unable to understand why white women go for blacks. Interestingly, they despise these relationships more than German guys.</p>
<p>Where are white man failing at? OK, the media promotes dark skinned men. But are the white girls/women so naive?</p>

		<p>Blacks gravitate towards wherever whites happen to congregate, despite blacks&rsquo; incessant complaints of never-ending &#8216;white racism&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s because they know they&rsquo;ll be safer, better taken care of, better off, and in general more prosperous if they live in white-majority settings rather than in black sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that black men will choose a white woman, preferably a blonde (the fairer the better!) whenever possible. It just makes for a better relationship, no doubt.</p>
<p>I suppose you could say the same for black women gravitating towards white men, but speaking as a white man, I have never once felt inclined to dating - let alone marrying - a black woman. Maybe white men are just plain different than white women re: their feelings towards shacking up with blacks.</p>

<p>Actually, I think the answer is really quite siimple.  People  of that financial and world-fame stature want the very best and can afford it.</p>
<p>And simply, because the white woman is the most beautiful of all the races, they choose her.  And so it is especially with blacks, the first thing they get is a white woman.  </p>
<p>It is the most natural thing in the world to want the best.</p>

<p>&#8220;The question that should be asked is that why do so many White men date and marry Asian women?&#8221;</p>
<p>I married an Asian woman because I finally gave up with white women after 8 years of trying.  I&rsquo;m a successful white male with a graduate degree in computer science.  White women wanted nothing to do with me, to the point of humiliating me.  I had no problem dating smart, attractive, asian women.  </p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that these men feel &#8220;inadequate&#8221; if you know what I mean.  Asian women are easier to approach given the &#8220;stereotype&#8221;, if you can call it that, about oriental males.  These men in years past would have been married to the fat trashy White women in pajamas you see with blacks.  <br>

<p>Pre-scandal &#8216;Tiger&rsquo; only affected my life once.  His endorsement of the Buick Enclave persuaded me to purchase a Lexus SUV, instead.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re all so gleeful over this, now.  Maybe his image won&rsquo;t be pushed at us from all directions, for the rest of our lives, as it would have been, had this not happened.

		<p>Unfortunately, the media brainwashing about people of color being so wonderful is almost always more effective on white women.  Therefore, if they are not firmly oriented in their white heritage they can drift when a Tiger Woods comes along.  When it comes to race realism I find that Asian women are very blunt about their assessments of blacks.  For whatever reason, some white women have devolved into a fairy tale view of the world, and I hope for all our sakes they grow up and get out of it.</p>

		<p>I am not sure that Tiger Woods reject the Black community or has contempt for Afro and Asian women. He is an offspring of both races.<br>
The diatribe about his mistresses is an ad hominen fallacy; [guilt / honor by association] depending on the premises. </p>
<p>He might have a preference for blonde but this is not a sacrilege to the Afro and the Asian communities. He has a right to pick the woman he likes without third party interferences.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s speculating as to why all the women on the so called &#8220;scandal&rdquo; are Caucasians.<br>
The PGA of America has 28,000 members only 145 are Afro-American; that represent less than one percent of Afro-American in golf. Golf is predominantly a Caucasian oriented sport. This implies that the chance for him to meet an Afro-American woman in a golf environment is negligible or almost nil; consequently, the women he met in golf setting are Caucasian.</p>
<p>His indulgence in profligate amours should not be a surprise. Scientific observation suggests that polygamy seem to be prevalent throughout the animal kingdom  &mdash;  from birds to Homo sapiens; monogamy tends to be a rarity in nature. This is a biological reality. If you have any doubts about it check the history of: Sumerian, Babylonia, Phoenician, China, Egypt, ancient Greece, Roman Empire, Byzantine, Elizabethan times, the French, The Russian, and modern day America. Monogamy started in Western Europe and it was artificially imposed to several countries in the West for economic reason. To conclude: Jacqueline Kennedy said: &ldquo;I do not think there are any men who are faithful to their wives.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>White men date/marry Asian women b/c those particular white men are meek and mild, but don&rsquo;t want to be dominated. They want someone to dominate and think of the Asian female as meeker and milder than they. The Asian female typically agrees with this role.</p>
<p>White men date/marry black women (like the couple on the most recent Amazing Race show) b/c those particular white men are meek and mild, but in contrast to the men with Asian women, these men WANT to be dominated. The black women I have seen with white men are definitely the ones who wear the pants in the relationship and the men are fine with it.</p>
<p>Now, successful black men go straight for the blonde white woman b/c that is as much of a status symbol as having an expensive car and house. </p>

<p>I think the answer to your question, if it is indeed correct that American Men date and marry Asian women is that men are more or less turned off by our own women unfortuneately. No man wants a women who basiccally sees herself in competition with her spouse. This is where feminism went haywire. Teaching young women that women have been somehow oppressed and now they want to get back at men. Who would want to lay in bed next to someone like that? I&rsquo;ve heard women boast about making more money than their husbands. That&rsquo;s a disgrace. </p>

		<p>Which is why it is quite normal to see successful non Europeans married to European women (Yannick Noah, English Blacks, Zinedine Zidane,Imran Khan, and even colored rugby players based in places such NZ and Australia). European Black</p>
<p>   So you&rsquo;re bringing up the old bromide that Europeans are less prejudiced than American whites against blacks. Could it be that Europeans have only had large numbers of blacks in their midst comparatively recently?  High profile marriages between black celebrities and whites prove nothing. The growth of &#8220;right wing&#8221; parties may indicate that the winds of change are blowing.  </p>

Recently  while here in Melbourne,Australia  he was given   3 million dollars by the local State Govt as an incentive(read bribe) to come here.Yet  Tiger was playing other games beside golf at the luxury hotel he was apparently smuggling in his lady friend(s) <br>
 I wonder how much of that money went to pay her airfare and also how much to pay off her and all the others clamoring<br>
 for a `piece` of the pie</p>
<p>By the way most people I know tend to think of Tiger as sometype of  mixed  race celebrity rather than as straight<br>

of the lady friend antics!) <br>

<p>White Man Cometh, it doesn&rsquo;t quite work that way.  Only the less intelligent white women go along as trophy wives for the black man.  That way white women with low IQ genes are prevented from contributing to their own gene pool - thus leaving the white gene pool stronger than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a genetic factor known as &#8216;reversion to the mean&rsquo; which says that any benefit the white woman may take to the black gene pool is diluted in accordance with the entire genetic history brought to the union by both partners.</p>

		<p>Had Obama been married to a white woman, he could never have gained acceptance from most whites of either gender or from many black women.  Though I may easily be wrong, I suspect he wed Michelle with political thoughts already in mind.  Many whites who accept respectable blacks as co-workers, neighbors, or even friends do not approve of interracial mating.  <br>
Black people themselves have always considered light-skinned members to be more attractive, no matter what the latest arguments are to the contrary.  White people think &#8220;blondes have more fun&#8221;, and creamy-complexioned Asian women are thought prettier. And, with the sexual revolution making more white women available for trysts, white men are not having sex with black women like they did in the old days.  The sisters are having more and more trouble getting anything more than one- night stands.  No wonder 3/4 of black births are now out-of-wedlock.<br>

Anyway, there are several sites featuring Asian women, but there are no sites featuring African women, yet Africa is, if anything, even poorer than Asia.

<p>To those posters who have been suggesting that interracial mating is a <i>deliberate</i> strategy on the part of Africans to dilute and destroy the white race: </p>
<p>I can see how it might appear that way to you. And the dilution/destruction of the white race may indeed be the eventual result of all this. But a <i>deliberate strategy</i>? When have blacks <i>deliberately</i> done <i>anything</i>? When have blacks ever <i>strategized</i> anything? Since when do blacks know enough about genes and genealogy to conceptualize such a masterplan? For them, this isn&rsquo;t about long-range global conquest   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s about tonight&rsquo;s sexual conquest. </p>
<p>The bulk of black problems can be traced to their near-complete <i>lack</i> of strategy, deliberation, forethought, planning, or rational thinking. Probably half the black men in prison are there for botched crimes (and/or botched getaways) that simply weren&rsquo;t planned very well   &mdash;   crimes that a somewhat smarter white criminal probably could&rsquo;ve pulled off while avoiding capture. </p>
<p>The African mentality is geared to improvisation, not structure. Africans act on impulse, not grand designs. They just wing it. They live in the here-and-now. Neither yesterday nor tomorrow mean as much to them as they do to us. This is why blacks invented jazz and not opera. How many black composers would have the patience (let alone the ability) for the construction of a four-opera, 12-hour epic like Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Ring Cycle</i>? How many black writers would even attempt a massive undertaking like Tolkein&rsquo;s <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy? </p>
<p>So any &ldquo;genetic theft&rdquo; that may be going on is is strictly accidental. When the brothas go chasin&rsquo; them blond wimmins around, it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re &#8220;up to something&#8221; or engaged in some secret Long March For Genetic Supremacy. They&rsquo;re just mindlessly pleasure-seeking (as per usual) but with the added benefit of doing something that annoys Whitey. </p>

<p>&#8220;A porn star and a pancake house waitress added their names to an ever-increasing list of women who have come forward or been called out for reportedly having affairs with golf superstar Tiger Woods, bringing the tally to at least nine.&#8221; (One of them is a porno star.)</p>
<p>(Snip) </p>
<p>The leftist, dense reporter on the story asks the question about how Tiger could keep so many affairs secret for so long.</p>
<p>The answer, of course&hellip;&hellip;that anybody with even half-a brain could answer&hellip;&hellip; is that these weren&rsquo;t &#8220;affairs.&#8221;  They were hookers he paid.  </p>
<p>Are we to believe this unattractive man has women falling at his feet for nothing but lust for him?  Nonsense.</p>
<p>This is an excellent illustration of how the biased, pro-black media will go to any lengths to avoid placing a black in an unfavorable light.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll also go to any legths to avoid reporting ANYTHING unfavorable to blacks and the leftist ideology.</p>
<p>How many mainfringe news outlets have reported on the explosive story on the manipulation of climate change data?  How many EVER reported on the communist and anti-white hater Van Jones on the Obama team as a &#8220;green czar?&#8221;  Or how about the other flakes oddballs and misfits in the Obama administration and blacks among the general population are given passes?  Didn&rsquo;t we just get a story out of Philadelphia about &#8220;students&#8221; attacking Asians, but no mention of blacks and CERTAINLY no mention that blacks are embroiled in assaults and rioting all across the country against every racial group.</p>
<p>They are now in the process of trying to mend the damage of one of their high profile black miscreants, Tiger Woods.  If the effort they put forth to clear him, as they did to clear Kobe Bryant of raping a defenseless white girl is any indication of their coming efforts in favor of Woods, there&rsquo;s going to be so many lies and exaggerations told it will be criminal, and those responsible should be locked up away from the general public for criminal obstruction of the public&rsquo;s right to know the truth.</p>
<p>How many gullible white nationals will come forward now and try to defend this man?  I have no doubt someone will, and it&rsquo;s truly disgusting to have people like that on our side.</p>

		<p>Look,this is typical for black men.  And I believe the post above is absolutely correct.  It is a deliberate FU to white men. However, it&rsquo;s not really the black men I blame, it&rsquo;s the stupid white women that follow black men around like little puppy dogs.  It&rsquo;s sickening.</p>
<p>I still would like to know why any white women would, despite all the brainwashing and indoctrination over the last many years that it&rsquo;s okay for black and white to date and marry and produce children, why ANY white women would want to have a child with a race of men that usually end up abandoning their children.  70% is a pretty high percentage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just glad my father told me and my siblings that he&rsquo;d kick our butts if we ever brought a black person home, which I guess by today&rsquo;s standards, my Dad would be a bigot.  </p>

<i>&#8220;Taking our genes and claiming them for their own and attributing the many positive qualities that they pick up from their White mother - claiming those qualities for their own race - this is &ldquo;genetic theft&rdquo;.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I agree with much of your post   &mdash;   it suggests, as the author of post 32 writes, too much intention   &mdash;   but I do with an aspect of this portion. Has anyone else noticed how in most endeavors in which blacks are involved, be it beauty pageants or intellectual matters or whatever, those that are best are half-white/ half-something mulattoes, but they consider themselves just &#8220;black&#8221; and whatever good performance they make belonging to the black race? Their admixture of foreign genes is, in almost all cases I would guess, responsible for their high quality, but there is never any acknowledgement of them being so, or, god forbid, gratitude for having them.</p>

<p>The East African Hamitic type (generally unknown in the USA) often has finely chiseled features, quite unlike the  thick-lipped West African Bantu type which is the standard  &#8220;black&#8221; in America. There is more difference between them than between a Berber and a Swede.  There is tremendous variety among ethnic groups in Africa. The blacks brought here (nearly all from West Africa anyway) became blended together into a common genetic soup, losing any tribal differentiation   &mdash;   and then with a good dollop of Caucasian genes to boot.</p>

It&rsquo;s a mental illness and is indicative of a total lack of self-respect and self-worth.

     Most of us here are aware that due to China&rsquo;s One Child policy and the consequent female infanticide/abortion problem, there are not enough Chinese women to go around.  What are all these lonely Chinese men to do?   Similarly, when Whites defile themselves, there are fewer potential mates for self-respecting Whites.  What are lonely Whites to do?    I am married to a White woman, and I have never considered dating a non-White, but if my only choice was between White Trash and Oriental Quality, I&rsquo;d have to go with Quality.  I&rsquo;d rather not dilute my genetic heritage at all, but better to dilute it with straight black hair and skinny eyes than stupidity and brutish character.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s irrelevant why many black men desire White women.  Let them drool all they want.  Rather, we should ask why many White women wish to be with black men.  </p>

<p>That statement flies in the face of the fact most White women who pair off with black men are not with RICH black men.  Check Census figures.  Case in point:</p>

<p>Undoubtedly in Tiger&rsquo;s case, the fact he&rsquo;s rich and famous was the deciding factor for these bimbos.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s realistic to ascribe just one cause for the phenomenon of black-White pairings (and let&rsquo;s not forget the fact White MEN have also committed the sin of miscegenation!).</p>

<p>The reason that some White Woman marry black men is because the families of these white woman tolerate it. If these race-traior white women were disowned by their WHITE fathers and White mothers, 99.9 percent of white female and black male marriages would never have occured. If the White Female understood in no uncertain terms that dating,marrying black males and having their children meant no more mother -daughter conservations permanetly..and white daddy not walking her down the wedding aile 16 hours before she consumates the marraige with Leshawn or Leroy&hellip;these woman would get the message real fast.</p>
<p>Randy Moss is married to a blue eyed blond hair Southern White Women. Her White father thinks its just terrifc that his White daughter is married to a superstar black jock. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother her father that an attractive White Women has been removed from the population of available potetnial  White  wives available to young Appalachian me. Randy Moss&rsquo;s father is a disgrace.</p>
<p>When you sit in a sports stadium emotional involved with a team of young multimillioniare black males running around in tight spandex&hellip;what signal are you sending to your young White daughters and White wife. Millions of White Males are decieving themselves that this activity is harmless and just about White Guys having a litle bit of fun. </p>
<p>There is a very deep sickness among a large population of Native Born White Males.  </p>
<p>I oppose miscegenation with every fiber of my being.</p>

		<p>This patern of black male behavior is common, although there are exceptions. I know  a white woman who married a white man. They had a retarded child. The husband abandoned them. Much to the horror of the woman&rsquo;s father, she re-married a black man. (He was actually mixed race.) The black guy turned out to be a good husband and a good father of the disabled child. He also refused to have children with her, because he didn&rsquo;t want to bring any mixed race children into the world. He had a negative experience himself as a mixed race child, and did not want to force that pain on his offspring. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not liberal. I just thought it was fair to mention the exceptions.</p>

		<p>Sorry to disappoint you but anglo saxon women are not the top race mixers, the French are by far the champions of race mixing.</p>
<p>In France miscegenation is common and they don&rsquo;t even talk about it only some time they encourage white people to mix with their black or arab brothers.</p>
<p>France will be the first former white country to ireversably transform into a mulatto republic.</p>
<p>It is possible that the French were the first to massively race mix.</p>
<p>The French are despised in Eastern Europe but they endangered the whole Europe.</p>

		<p>I have been asked out by black men, and I don&rsquo;t know if it has anything to do with the fact that I have been blond since birth.  I do know what my advice is to white women who wish that black men would not try to date them.  Tell them that you are a lesbian.  It will get you out of it without the hassle of being presumed a bigot, and it will get you out of the hassle of being blamed by every black woman who can&rsquo;t find the man of her dreams because some loser she doesn&rsquo;t want anyway is hitting on you.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to lie to black men.  I really am a lesbian so I can address the questions about white men and Asian women.  I have been on lesbian sites and contacted by Asian women wanting to know whether same-sex marriage is legal where I live.  I get the impression that they sometimes aren&rsquo;t even lesbian so I am sure that they often contact white men not because they are white but because they want someone, anyone, to get them out of their crummy environment.</p>
<p>Some of the e-mail that I have gotten from women from places like Manila really cracked me up while I also know that the women&rsquo;s situations are really sad.  They will claim to love me after a couple of e-mails and beg can&rsquo;t I please make them my wife or domestic partner.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  A white man who has seen too much Asian porn will fall for the kind of stuff that these women have tried to pull on me on lesbians sites.  I don&rsquo;t believe that they are bad women for wanting to raise their standard of living, but I don&rsquo;t want white men playing the fools thinking that Asian women think that there is something special about white men because some of these same women have contacted me on lesbian sites.  I am sure of it. </p>

I am not offended by racially aware opinions, but I do believe that criticisms should be accurate.  The White men I am acquainted with who have Oriental wives are, without exception, intelligent, as are their wives.  The only trash among them is a not-distant-enough relative with Yellow fever, who got himself an internet bride from the Phillipines.  (The family respects her far more than they respect him.)  <br>
     Having been in the military myself, I know that the foreigners who make themselves available around American bases are not the pick of the local litter.  Your Navy experience is irrelevant to the issue of educated American White men who choose to marry Oriental women here in the States.  These guys don&rsquo;t pick their women up in bars, they meet them in grad school.  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind so much if these men were all trash like my young relative, but I don&rsquo;t like to see some of our best genes going multi-culti.  Still, all these women, including the internet Filipina, are Quality, and even if any of these men were racially aware, I still couldn&rsquo;t see them mating with a tattooed herpes carrier instead.  When so many Whites choose to act no better than Blacks, some good Whites will look elsewhere for company.  Rather than damning them as race traitors, we ought work at improving our own kind.    <br>

     Some of the Hispanics are White.<br>
     Some of the White men are as low class as your average Mestizo Hispanic.<br>
     A White guy is a good deal for a Hispanic woman, so she makes herself appealing to him.  Twice as many Hispanic women go to college as Hispanic men, so there are not enough educated men for all the women who would like one.  So they go White, which has always been a step up for them anyway. <br>
     Actually, for an older White man who doesn&rsquo;t want any kids, the older Hispanic woman can be a pretty good deal.  Except for her kids.  And the rest of her family.  </p>

<p>That will indeed be interesting to see. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time. However, I don&rsquo;t think it will be soon   &mdash;   not likely while he&rsquo;s president. Perhaps well after he&rsquo;s served his purpose and is out of the way/irrelevant.   For the present, I imagine that his handlers have him far too carefully supervised to allow for any hijunks of the Woods variety. Maybe JFK had his White House escapades and got away with them, but that was another era; and Kennedy was white.  Kennedy didn&rsquo;t have to be a spiffy-clean, near-religious figure.  The invisible powers that be have too much invested in the mulatto messiah to permit anything to go wrong.</p>
<p>And if it did, we could expect to hear the outraged howls of millions of blacks that the whole thing was a set-up to discredit a black president. They would never believe it. It would threaten a national crisis.   Obama can&rsquo;t lose!</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;The National Enquirer caught Tiger Woods in a steamy extramarital affair two years ago, but killed the story in exchange for the golfer doing a rare cover-shoot for its sister mag&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yjt9q68" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yjt9q68</a></p>
<p>Drudge reports:</p>
<p>&#8221;..Tiger Woods&rsquo; list of possible paramours grew to eleven Tuesday with the addition of a second porn star&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Gatorade has dropped Tiger Woods&rsquo; sports drink&hellip;.Advertisements featuring Tiger Woods have disappeared from prime-time broadcast television and many cable channels following reports of his extramarital affairs, according to data from Nielsen Co&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Although I suspect this is temporary until things blow over, as they did with Kobe Bryant:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The 2004 sexual assault charges brought against basketball player Kobe Bryant had a chilling effect on his ability to earn endorsements with the likes of McDonald&rsquo;s, Coke, and Nike for a while, but after he was acquitted, the sponsorship deals eventually started rolling back in</p>
<p>He has since resumed endorsement deals with The Coca-Cola Company, and appeared in a commercial for the video game Guitar Hero World Tour with Tony Hawk, Michael Phelps, and Alex Rodriguez in 2008. Nike held onto Bryant and eventually did start promoting Bryant once his image was back up 2 years later&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>I suspect woods will be soon lionized in the black community as a &#8216;playa.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is that there are a number of White men who have sex with Black women, especially those under 40.&#8221;</p>
<p>And according to my own personal observations, once and only once. That is because the experince is a &#8220;gross out.&#8221;  The olfactory system is the first sense assulted, the rest are all offended in turn, with emotional return the final disappointment.  Race is the final object.  </p>

<p>&#8220;To all American readers here,</p>
<p>Please bear with me on this subject. I am Black youngster living in French Belgium and would like to point out that here in Europe things do not quite work the same way. Europeans simply are unable to conduct themselves like Americans do.&#8221; </p>
<p>&gt; Well, this depends upon what part of Europe you are talking about.</p>
<p>&#8220;America, if I am correct was founded on Puritan beliefs and segregation(as in separate but equal)but Europeans tend to show their love to any successful non white in the continent(be it fame, American style hygiene etc) Most Blacks living in Europe would pass for the &lsquo;n word&rsquo; in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a misread of American history and European history.  First, Europeans set up the slave systems in the New World that left Whites who inherited the problem to sort it out.  The Puritanism perhaps figures in part of the cause of our Civil War.  (Religious fanatics like John Brown helped bring it on and exacerbate the righteousness of the Northern cause).  Second, until the 20th century, Europeans held a similar, if not even deeper feeling of elite whiteness.  Two world wars and a new socialist style drive for equality through race denial is what is responsible for the current carelessness of many Western Europeans where they progeny is concerned.</p>
<p>Last, you can only be Creole is you are indigenous to Louisiana and are part of that Creole culture.  Creole is a specific LA subculture, separate from Cajun or any other group.  A Creole is one who hails from a subculture comprised of French, Indian, and black ancestry in the LA, New Orleans region. <br>

		<p>&#8220;On the one hand, Ebonie Johnson Cooper doesn&rsquo;t care that Tiger Woods&rsquo; wife and alleged mistresses are white because Woods is &ldquo;quote-unquote not really black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But at the same time we still see him as a black man with a white woman, and it makes a difference,&rdquo; said Johnson Cooper, a 26-year-old African-American from New York City. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just this preservation thing we have among one another. We like to see each other with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Yeah and whites would like to preserve their race too but to say so out loud would be considered racist and only minorites, particularly blacks are allowed to have such opinions. <br>

		<p>&#8220;Why do they go for the nearest Blonde?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that White women are far more attractive than Black women are. It is also a bit of evolutionary psychology. Blacks are improving their genetic line with Blonde White women. It&rsquo;s also a way of sticking it to the White Man by taking his woman away from him. The more of our women that Blacks and other races take away from us through miscegenation the closer we get to extinction as a race. It&rsquo;s a way of destroying us. Taking our genes and claiming them for their own and attributing the many positive qualities that they pick up from their White mother - claiming those qualities for their own race - this is &ldquo;genetic theft&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s sole purpose is to better them and destroy us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, you could say that they are attempting to improve their genetic makeup but you could also say the reverse, in that they are trying real hard to muck up the white race on purpose.<br>

		<p>86 Whiteplight: There are different definitions of &#8220;Creole&#8221;.  Originally, it meant a full-blood Spaniard who was born in the New World rather than the home country.  The Spanish had a very elaborate system of racial categorization that accounted for White, Black, and Indian ancestry, by eighths.  Any Octaroon who tried to pass as a Creole would have got the point of a rapier back in the Good Ol&rsquo; Days.  <br>
     The word has acquired different meanings since then, and the New Orleans version is only one of them.  </p>

I saw the pictures and most of the women he slept with are brunettes and aren&rsquo;t necessarily particularly attractive women.  A few of those women are so mediocre and unattractive that I am sure most men would not consider dating them.  And two or three of them do not even look white.  They look hispanic to me.  </p>

		<p>Well, here&rsquo;s another lady that was approached by Woods&rsquo; agent, and here&rsquo;s what she thought of his looks.  She said he might be rich but he&rsquo;s also, &#8220;as ugly as sin.&#8221;  </p>
<p>A pattern has already emerged.  Woods is a pay for sex guy, and the media wants to make him out as irresistably attractive.  Ha!</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m so critical of him, a fan of his told me I was just  jealous of all his wealth, which is false.  I&rsquo;m glad to see this arrogantly wealthy, and privileged type get his come uppance, not JUST because he&rsquo;s wealthy, but because he has been made into a media darling, just like O.J. Simpson and Kobe Bryant, by the radical leftists. </p>
<p>And it delights me no end to see the gossip sheets fight tooth and nail to get out every sordid detail while the mainfringe media is still trying to keep it all as quiet as they can by not reporting a lot of what is transpiring.</p>
<p>This same media placed him so high on a pedestal, as is their habit with blacks who are not presently robbing, raping or stealing, the least little scandal could have ruined him.  This sideshow is huge, however.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1234379/Tiger-Woods-Porn-star-Joslyn-James-tenth-woman-linked-disgraced-golfer.html#ixzz0ZFMIB0Pe" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1234379/Tiger-Woods-Porn-star-Joslyn-James-tenth-woman-linked-disgraced-golfer.html#ixzz0ZFMIB0Pe</a></p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Now a famous TV presenter in Stockholm, (Caroline Gynning)  she blogged that she was at a party where she met Woods&rsquo; &#8216;agent&rsquo; at a party.</p>
<p>&#8220;She described him as a &#8216;really strange man who I assumed was gay,&rsquo; adding &#8216;he wanted to tell me something special.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;After accepting a lunch invitation, she said the man asked her &#8216;strange questions&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wondered if I knew who Tiger Woods was, and obviously I did,&rsquo; she wrote. &#8216;He said he was friends with Tiger and that Tiger loved girls like me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said that Tiger was looking for a girlfriend and that he wanted to introduce me to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never got back to the guy, obviously, even if Tiger is rich, he&rsquo;s also ugly as sin.&#8221; </p>

  &mdash;   Schoolteacher<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Once again, Schoolteacher is correct. Creole (Fr.) (Criollo in Sp.) meant - originally at least   &mdash;   a Spaniard born in the colonies. (One born in Spain was a &#8216;Peninsular&rsquo; and was socialy/legally superior.) The arrogance of the Peninsulares chafed on wealthy (but socially inferior) Criollos like Bolivar and San Martin and precipitated the wars of independence. Such a person would have been quite insulted at the suggestion he was a mulatto.</p>
<p>And yes, Spain had an elaborately defined social system, where eveyone had a clearly designated place.  This would have been true, in fact, of all feudal societies, pre-1789, with many social divisions.  Nor could they legally marry across social boundaries (much less racial). I assume the French colonies had that system as well, as they certainly did at home, and they were both ruled by Bourbons.  On reading his claim to be a &#8220;Creole&#8221;,  I was wondering if Belgium had such a system in its African colony, and if it borrowed the same terminology.  Most likely, I would guess.</p>
<p>But, way back then, there&rsquo;s no way a black would have called himself a creole. But there&rsquo;s no way an African would have called himself a Belgian either. The two were night and day.<br>

		<p>This is a topic I can really sink my teeth into. I am a 41 yr old white male who married later in life and has a 4 yr old daughter. Prior to being married I spent 7 yrs in the Army and have been all over the world, prior to settling down I led a life alot like Brad Pitts character in the movie Legends of the Fall, and have the life experiences that come with.</p>
<p>Black men love white women for the following reasons. 1.It is the ultimate FU to the white man. 2. White women are by far the most submissive and accommodating sexually than any other race. White women are very open minded and sexually uninhibited, providing black men with sexual experiences they could never get from a black woman, black women are useless in bed. Also there are olefactory issues south of the beltline. 4.Black women are combative,nagging shrews that black men can deal with in short doses only.</p>
<p>White women who choose black men do so because 1. they are slaves to their erogenous nerve bundles 2. Because black men have a firm grasp of Nietzche&rsquo;s &#8220;bring a whip&#8221; concept. 3. Because its a novel and exciting way of getting back at daddy and white men in general.</p>
<p>This generations white women are the product of post-modern feminisim. They have the perfect storm mixture of secular humanism amd nihilism, it should be no surprise that they are attracted to and attract black men.</p>
<p>While racial purity is the ideal, pragmatism is needed when white men look for a mate, fact is when one is presented with tramp stamp garbage, and  misandrist control freaks it might behoove one to go outside ones own race. I suggest Hispanic or Asian in that order.</p>

<p>I have trouble understanding your response to my post.</p>
<p>When you said <i>&#8220;That&rsquo;s true. Some of them look no better than Korean females.&#8221;</i> Was it some kind of a &#8220;returning insult&#8221; at me?  Did you feel I meant I think white women in general are not attractive?  Was that particular sentence of yours supposed to hurt my feelings?  Did you feel I am being unfairly protective of East Asian women whereas I am disrespecting women of other races?  </p>
<p>Buddy, white women have the overwhelming majority of East Asian boys&rsquo; deepest respect, and I am not an exception.  I constantly learn and receive help from white women around me and I see wonderful, beautiful white women around me all the time.  They are not only beautiful on the outer side, but also they are fantastic inside.  My parents and many male/female East Asian friends also agree white women are extremely beautiful.  </p>
<p><i>No, the correct figure is that 12% of them are married to black women. The other 88% couldn&rsquo;t offer enough money for a white women to marry them, because, as the Swedish actress said of Tiger Woods, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wealthy, but he&rsquo;s ugly as sin.</i></p>
<p>So what are you trying to say?  If 12% are married to black women and 88% of black men could not match white women&rsquo;s expectations, are you indicating 100% of black men are married to black women?  and 0% are married to white women?  </p>
<p>Or if you meant 12% of the black men who married within their race, chose to marry black women and 88% of the black men who married within their race simply could not match white women&rsquo;s expectations?</p>
<p>Maybe, I do not care.  It does not quite interest me&hellip;  regarding why black men chose their spouses&hellip; my life is too short and my brain has other things to do.  </p>
<p>I do not have a girlfriend at the moment&hellip;  :( but that&rsquo;s ok!! :) saves me a lot of money and gives me a lot of time to do other things I like to do.  (nice excuses aren&rsquo;t they)</p>
<p>One of my best friends&hellip; named Joseph&hellip; he is from China and he is one of the greatest men I have ever met in my life&hellip; he is currently working towards his doctorate in chemistry at University of British Columbia. </p>
<p>He posted a picture on facebook just a couple of days ago&hellip;  with his wife.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v122/246/31/28124709/n28124709_38379567_7980.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v122/246/31/28124709/n28124709_38379567_7980.jpg</a></p>
<p>and this was taken shortly after Joe&rsquo;s graduation ceremony.  It has been a while since then. </p>
<p><a href="http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v97/246/31/28124709/n28124709_36384792_500.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v97/246/31/28124709/n28124709_36384792_500.jpg</a></p>
<p>See&hellip;  I think his white wife is enormously beautiful..  I clearly admit she is one of the most prettiest women I have ever met and will meet in my life.  She is going to start working on her graduate degree at U of BC as well some time in the near future.  (Joe told me his wife&rsquo;s undergraduate GPA is higher than his)  And Joe also thinks his wife is extremely beautiful and that&rsquo;s why they got married.  I told you, East Asian men do love, respect and admire white women&hellip;.  trust me.  East Asian men love and respect white women.  </p>
