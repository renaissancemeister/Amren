<h1>Slaying of Drug War Hero&rsquo;s Family Shocks Mexico</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>E. Eduardo Castillo, Washington Examiner, December 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Assailants on Tuesday gunned down the mother, aunt and siblings of a marine killed in a raid that took out one of Mexico&rsquo;s most powerful cartel leaders  &mdash;  sending a chilling message to troops battling the drug war: You go after us, we wipe out your families.</p>
<p>The brazen pre-dawn slayings came just hours after the navy honored Melquisedet Angulo as a national hero at a memorial service.</p>
<p>&#8220;The message is very clear: It&rsquo;s to intimidate not only the government but its flesh and blood,&#8221; said Jorge Chabat, a Mexican expert on drug cartels. &#8220;It&rsquo;s to intimidate those in the armed forces so they fear not only for their own lives, but the lives of their families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Federal officials had warned last week&rsquo;s killing of drug lord Arturo Beltran Leyva, known as the &#8220;boss of bosses,&#8221; could provoke a violent backlash from smugglers, who have gone after federal police in the past following the arrest of high-ranking cartel members.</p>
<p>Beltran Leyva was among the most-wanted drug lords in Mexico and the United States, and was the biggest trafficker taken down by President Felipe Calderon&rsquo;s administration so far. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials blamed his cartel for much of the bloodshed across Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hit men linked to Beltran Leyva&rsquo;s cartel have a strong presence in Tabasco, a Gulf state bordering Guatemala, and were suspected of being behind the attack. State and federal forces searching for the assailants set up roadblocks across the state Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Angulo, 30, was the only marine killed in the Dec. 16 raid that sparked a nearly two-hour shootout at an apartment complex in the colonial city of Cuernavaca, south of Mexico City. Two other marines were wounded.</p>
<p>Angulo was also the only marine whose identity was made public of the more than 60 who took part in the operation, which also left six other gunmen dead in addition to Beltran Leyva. Mexican troops never have their names or numbers on their uniforms to protect their identities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Tabasco attack came exactly one year to the day after authorities found the bodies of seven decapitated soldiers and five other victims in southern Guerrero state, a region where the Beltran Leyva cartel has been battling for control. The bodies were accompanied by a sign that warned: &#8220;For every one of mine that you kill, I will kill 10.&#8221; A bag of their heads, some still gagged with tape, was found nearby.</p>
<p>Those slayings, in Chilpancingo, an hour north of the resort of Acapulco, marked the worst attack against the Mexican army in its half-century battle against drug gangs.</p>
<p>After the gruesome discovery, the government held a high-profile ceremony aimed at reassuring the nation it would not surrender. Officials also released the names of the troops  &mdash;  just as the navy did Monday when it honored Angulo. Their sobbing wives appeared on national television receiving the flags that had been draped on their husbands&rsquo; coffins.</p>

		<p>Melquisedet Angulo in honor of you and your family who I never knew it is true that you lost your life in the line of duty following your chain of command and governments orders. When people use drugs many belive they are not harming anyone yet with but the barest scrutiny it becomes apparent that the casual drug use is killing so many. How the drug use in America influenced these events can be debated over time and the outcome is always the same the innocent are the victims of evil people who care nothing for life only gold. May you rest in peace and my heart is saddened for the loss of life inflicted upon your family. May my simple prayer go straight to Gods ear that he takes care of you and yours better than we who are left behind did. God Bless you.  </p>

		<p>Americans and our politicians have been promoting the &#8220;War on Some Drugs&#8221; for a long time now.  It&rsquo;s not enough that this war is fought in America, but the U.S. government also pressures (or forces) this war on other countries.  For countless generations, people used opium, marijuana, mushrooms etc. and some of the were irresponsible enough to ruin their lives and make their friends and families miserable - much like alcohol today.  But due to the War on Some Drugs, the price of otherwise cheap drugs is so high that dealers are willing to kill for the profits.  Because of this war, mild drugs like marijuana have been transformed into more potent varieties so that they are easier to smuggle due to smaller quantities needed.  Because of this war, crime and political corruption have reached new levels previously unheard of.  The U.S. government is creating chaos and much bloodshed all over the world through its drug policies.  If we stop this unwinnable war, then many of the problems we have now will diminish over time.  Our borders would be more secure, crime would decrease and many drug users&rsquo; lives would be saved - since they would be more likely to know the exact quality and dosage they are getting.  Users and their families would get treatment instead of incarceration or violent death.  The cost would be much less for the rest of us.</p>

		<p>Like most countries, including the US, the Mexican &#8220;leadership&#8221; is only interested in perpetuating their own power and wealth.  They care nothing for the average Joe (or Jose).  That is why the Mexican government spends so much time giving instructions to their citizens on how to sneak into the US and on lobbying US officials to not the guard the border.  The US is Mexico&rsquo;s relief valve.  Decent Mexicans, like Marine Melquisedet Angulo, have less of a chance than we do at saving their country.  Maybe all of North America is doomed, with Mexico being the first domino, then the US and finally Canada toppling over.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You go after us, we wipe out your families.&#8221;</p>
<p>As outrageous and cruel as it seems, such action has always resulted in success for the criminals who employ it.  It happens in war time also.</p>
<p>This development is a bright neon sign that tells many of us that the cartels have reached a new plateau of strength, and it appears as if the present government could well be on the way out.</p>
<p>It all depends on whether the drug gangs gain a measure of unity.  So far, the only thing standing in their way for complete takeover is their hatred and competitiveness against each other.</p>
<p>Can anyone imagine what kind of chaotic situation the US empire will be in if it has to deal with a criminal enterprise in control of an entire country?</p>

		<p>This may not work the way the gangs intend.  It could instead result in the government deciding the best way to protect its own is to take no prisoners.</p>

		<p>These brazen attacks are only a small part of the crime and corruption in Mexico, judging from the news stories posted on AR on almost a daily basis. And yet, when Mexicans come to this country and they and their families turn to drugs, crime and gangs, we are told it is the corrupting influence of the United States that causes them to do such things! And Americans are told not to notice this, and they obey, because after all it is naughty naughty to notice bad behavior on the part of Mexicans!</p>

		<p>I must take issue with curt in comment #1. It is not drug users who are causing the violence, rather it is the laws prohibiting drug use that makes for an environment where criminals will supply drugs. There is so much money involved, that the drug lords are powerful enough to challenge the government in a country like Mexico.</p>
<p>All the violence would end if the United States would repeal its drug laws and cease the war on drugs, which is really a war on people.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, I do not approve of or encourage drug use, but the drug laws and the war on drugs is far more harmful.</p>

<p>This could&rsquo;ve come straight from Elliot Ness&rsquo;s mouth circa 1929. Just replace all instances of the word &#8220;drugs&#8221; with &#8220;liquor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angulo&rsquo;s death was not drug-related in the slightest, it was prohibition related. </p>

		<p>The reason there is little effect on the drug trade is because, like the war on terror, the U.S. government and the Mexican government are not prepared to do what needs to be done. We (the U.S. and the Mexicans) KNOW who, Where and when the big people in the drug trade are vulnerable but refuse to do anything about it because, in my opinion and experience, these criminals have things on powerful members of congress and senate who have a vested interest in that relationship NOT coming to light. We are fighting a TACTICAL war on drugs and muslim extremism and we should be fighting a STRATEGIC war. The difference, once being described by WWII USAAC General Curtis LeMay, as tactical being kicking over buckets of milk while strategic was killing the cow. We need to think and act strategically or nothing will be gained.</p>

		<p>We may as well share a border with one of the Middle Eastern countries. American citizens are left to the mercy of those who dishonor our immigration laws. They kill in their own country and then come here and kill among a variety of other crimes. The only difference is that our military protects the Middle Eastern countries, while we&rsquo;re left on our own. Our leaders don&rsquo;t care what happens here. And no one in Washington has the courage that Eisenhower did in the 50s. He said &#8220;leave&#8221; and they did. Our leaders are so PC they don&rsquo;t want to offend anyone&hellip;nor lose the votes/payoffs that come with permitting illegal aliens to come at will. Not only that, they will be rewarded with all the goodie we can give them, then the ultimate prize&hellip;citizenship. What has happened to this once-proud and honorable country?</p>

		<p>Neither casual nor habitual drug users caused the deaths in Mexico. The profits from illegal drugs caused those deaths and those profits are only available because drugs are illegal. Stop the drug prohibition and the wealth it creates will dry up. Then the bribes, drug lords, drug armies, smuggling, trafficking, street corner sales, burglaries and other illegal activities needed to generate those huge profits will cease. Users will go into regular businesses (drug stores, retail outlets, 7-11s) to buy their drugs at reasonable prices that will afford them the opportunity to work low end jobs, and be users as well, much like our better situated addicts do now. Without the need to steal and murder to support expensive habits, these people will be able to lead peaceful, if dysfunctional lives. But more important than the comfort of these wretches would be the security that this approach affords to thousands of innocents who would otherwise be victimized by these unfortunates.</p>

<p>Yes, to say nothing about the vastly reduced prison populations, which would mean more space for violent criminals and less money spent on incarceration.  I would venture to say that rehabilitation programs for addicts who want help would likely cost far less than incarceration, because the cost of crime goes all the way through the court system, not just the jails and prisons, to say nothing about the cost to the victims of drug crimes and crimes by druggies to get money to buy more.</p>
<p>Legalization would take the profit out of drugs, and the benefits of doing that outweighs everything else. It&rsquo;s not even a debatable matter.</p>
<p>Like gambling, however, legalization will only occur when the governments are forced to reduce costs or let the criminals out of prison, when they desperately need the revenue from drug taxes, just as they now receive from gambling, a vice they preached against for centuries.</p>

		<p>The &ldquo;War On Drugs&rdquo; is a farce perpetrated on the American people to make the government and their crony contractors big *BIG* MONEY. Look, you can&rsquo;t keep drugs out of prisons, the most controlled society in the United States, how can you possibly expect to keep it off the block? If it were legal – all of it - there would be no profit potential to cause crime. No profit, no thugs.<br>
Legalize all of it and treat its abuse as a social problem.</p>

		<p>To those who say legalize drugs, I say NO! SEAL the damn border and no more immigration legal or illegal! Does anyone honestly believe that legalization will stop the drug cartels? Our government will tax the hell out of drugs thereby making it still cheaper to buy off the street! The cartels will even lower their prices and still make a hugh profit! </p>

		<p>The fellow who was killed was a petty officer - an NCO - which means he was in no way involved in the decision to launch the raid or its planning.  By killing this man&rsquo;s family, all the druggies did was sign their own death warrants, as the men who served with Angulo will remember this.</p>
