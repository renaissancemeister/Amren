<h1>Foreclosures Plague African-American Neighborhoods</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pamela Jones, KCAL-TV (Los Angeles), December 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Experts say it&rsquo;s becoming a crisis in Chicago: Homeowners losing almost everything in foreclosures. One agency tracking foreclosure filings is reporting at least an 18 percent jump in new foreclosures across Chicago, and the year isn&rsquo;t even over yet.</p>
<p>As CBS 2 [KCAL]&rsquo;s Pamela Jones reports, African-American families in certain Chicago neighborhoods are being hit the hardest.</p>
<p>The Woodstock Institute says there have been more new foreclosures in Englewood and West Englewood than in any neighborhood across the city; two neighborhoods heavily populated by African Americans. There have been 725 foreclosures in just the first nine months of this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harbin {snip} says when she applied to re-work her loan,  &#8220;They told me I didn&rsquo;t qualify because I wasn&rsquo;t behind on anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says they told her not to pay her bills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fueling what some mortgage counselors call a vicious cycle in neighborhoods like hers, pushing homeowners into foreclosure, leaving homes vacant, especially the homes of African Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tom Feltner is vice president of Chicago&rsquo;s Woodstock Institute, tracking new foreclosures, especially in communities of color.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So why is this hitting African-American neighborhoods so hard? CBS 2 is told it started with loans that had bad terms being pushed in that community more.</p>

		<p>I think that blacks&rsquo; lack of foresight comes into play.  Instant gratification.  Instead of saving up for the mortgage payment, they&rsquo;re buying spinning rims or some other shiny object.  Or something like that.</p>
<p>Guess Obama isn&rsquo;t paying their mortgages, is he?</p>

<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t. The reason why black-owned homes forclose disproportionately is because many blacks lack to forsight to get loans they can actually pay.</p>

		<p>Wow, right in Obama&rsquo;s hometown back yard!  What a surprise.  The thing is, and the LA reporter knows this, it&rsquo;s happening in every predominately black and poor area in the country.  And yes, I&rsquo;d say it WAS the lenders - these unscrupulous lenders gave mortgages to people whom they knew full well wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pay them.  It was a way for the lenders to make money off the foolishness and ignorance of ghetto blacks.  Yes, the borrowers SHOULD have been able to foresee their eventual bankruptcy - but look at the material we&rsquo;re working with here; do you seriously think they could see any further ahead than their own broad noses?  The lenders knew exactly what they were doing.  But the blacks SHOULD have known - as any normal adult would - and they didn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>Another shocking surprise about the behavior of blacks.  Another bit of news:  The repo rate on cars is highest in black neighborhoods as well.</p>
<p>Yet another example of &#8220;predatory lending,&#8221; that strange practice of lending money to people in the hope that they won&rsquo;t pay it back.  Everybody knows there&rsquo;s big money in this.</p>
<p>Only a typically ignorant and usually stupid liberal could believe something like this.</p>

		<p>Ultimately, the root cause is the policies of the federal government and the federal reserve.</p>
<p>Yes, there is corporate greed. But it is a constant. It has been around before any of us were born. There is also the issue of blacks low IQ&rsquo;s and lack of foresight. But again, this has been around for tens of thousands of years. Bankers used to screen credit risks because it was in their interest to do so, and it was not illegal to do so.</p>
<p>So why the sudden change? A credit bubble by the fed (read: creating money out of thin air to the point where anyone and everyone can get a loan), explicit and implicit support of fannie mae and freddy mac&rsquo;s reckless mortgage-buying policies by the fed, etc.</p>
<p>And in the end, it didn&rsquo;t create more affordable housing. It bid up prices. You can redistribute money all you want, but it is still chasing the same limited goods. If we had a policy 100 years ago to redistribute wealth so everyone could have a car, it would not give everyone a car. There wasn&rsquo;t enough production at that point, Henry Ford was just getting started. It would just bid up the price of cars, and the same number of people would have to make do with horses until production techniques caught up. (Granted, there would have been more businessmen getting into the car business, in this hypothetical case, but at the cost of other areas of the economy. Perhaps refrigerators would have remained a luxury good for much longer, for example.)</p>
<p>Before the government got involved in housing after WW2, the price of an average house was (adjusted for inflation) something like $40k~$50k. Mortgages were 5~10 years on average  &mdash;  if you even bothered to get one. Many just saved up for a few years.</p>

So why is this hitting African-American neighborhoods so hard? <br>
CBS 2 is told it started with <b>loans that had bad terms being <br>
pushed in that community more</b>.<br>
</i><br>
<p><br>
I read this article and have a different take on it. I think<br>
this is an attempt to portray Blacks as suffering more than<br>
Whites in this economic downturn (and soon to be an economic<br>
meltdown). It will probably be spun as Blacks are loosing their <br>
homes, in large part, due to some type of &#8220;institutional&#8221; <br>
racism. The end objective is probably some time of bailout for <br>
Black homeowners. Of course Whites don&rsquo;t suffer being <br>
discriminated against so no such bailout will be forthcoming for <br>
them.<br>
</p><br>
<p><br>
The reality is that White homeowners are going to be hit just as <br>
hard. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are responsible and take out a <br>
loan that you cand afford if you later loose your job and can&rsquo;t <br>
find another one that pays as well (or at least well enough for <br>
you to pay your mortgage). There are lots of intelligent and <br>
fiscally responsible White engineers that are out of work right <br>
now and many of them will be facing foreclosure.<br>

		<p>What the primary cause for these bad loans was that the<br>
Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) established by Carter and<br>
expanded by Clinton forced banks to lend to minorities. Their<br>
sanctimonious goal was to increase minority home ownership.<br>
Lending practices were thrown out.  When banks complained<br>
about being forced to make loans that they know would never be<br>
paid back the government told them to worry not, Fannie and Freddie would buy those loans. With the risks reduced banks<br>
made all the loans they could.</p>

		</legend>
		<p>The basic reason these jokers were given loans in the first place is:</p>
<p>1. Community Reinvestment Act and similar pressures. </p>
<p>2. Underwriting that assumed that a hot real estate market would always remain hot, with property values increasing. That way, if you loan money to a deadbeat to buy a house, and he couldn&rsquo;t pay it in a year, he could always sell it off or the value increase would let the lender foreclose without taking a great loss, as the increase in values would cover the foreclosure expense. FYI, In 2007, there was 100% financing available for people with credit scores as low as 560. Not a good idea!</p>
<p>Note that they did not take into account the fact the colored folks generally treat their properties horribly, with little maintenance being done and little in the way of improvements being made. Preventative maintenance requires long-term abstract thinking, which they just do not have the ability to do. If you have ever rented to blacks, and I do not recommend doing it, you will see that they tear up the property and are generally irresponsible with it. Having coloreds in your property WILL make it lose value most of the time.</p>
<p>3. Loan fraud - collusion between borrower, loan officer, and appraiser - the lenders thought they had much more collateral than they did, so the loan-to-value ratios looked better than they really were.</p>
<p>4. Unrealistic appraisal standards - Appraisers are not allowed to take the racial composition of an area into account when valuing a property. A house in the ghetto is thought to be comparable with the same house out in the &#8216;burbs. But my house in the &#8216;burbs does not have prostitutes and drug dealers out in the street in front of it, and is not likely to get broken into if I sit the box for a big screen TV out on trash day for the natives to see. So, while the house in the white part of town is worth more, and everyone knows it, the appraiser is supposed to not take notice of this fact.</p>
<p>5. A lack of a realistic view on the discharge of debts. Colored folks just do not consider, deep down in their hearts, that debts are a valid claim upon them. They do not feel a need to pay their bills, unless you have a lever on them, such as the repo man for a car. Blacks of all stripes will NOT pay their bills unless cornered into doing so. This ought to raise the risk premium for lending to them, but it is not supposed to. (I personally would not lend any of them so much as a dollar to get a coke. You won&rsquo;t get it back without trouble.)</p>
<p>NOBODY was forced to take a loan. While there were/are some unscrupulous loan officers and related professionals, this was as much a systemic thing with government pressures to make the loans as it was anything.</p>

		<p>This is an example of why the rent to own, we &#8220;tote the note&#8221; and check cashing stores tend to be in poorer/minority areas. Of course they get bad terms on their mortgages if they don&rsquo;t pay their bills. Find me a black person with a FICO score of 750 - 800 that earns a reasonable salary (for their area) who is screaming from the mountaintop that the white companies don&rsquo;t want his business. Find me a big box store that will not sell a flat screen tv to a black person who has the cash in hand to pay for it. </p>

		<p>Bad loans &#8220;pushed onto people&#8221; and just how is that done?  These are legal boilerplate contracts where all binding provisions are in writing.  One&rsquo;s voluntary signature on that contract means the consenting parties have read and understood those provisions.  We call this contract law, it is a central tenant to our economic system.  Some but not all states require attorney review as added protection on real estate transactions.  But even those states that don&rsquo;t require an attorney allow you to have a assistance in reviewing the contract should you choose.  Attention ACORN here is a real value-added service you can provide your constituents.<br>
If the courts decide that some folks were duped, then the longer term cure is to require attorney review and I would suggest a test of general real estate knowledge prior to allowing a loan.  This would include the expenses to own, the market cyclicality and potential for losses, as well as the ongoing and uncertain maintenance requirements for upkeep.  Add why in more than 1/3 of all housing decisions renting is a better financial decision.  <br>
Claiming ignorance and duping in this society and age is unacceptable, primarily because is is unlikely in most cases.  A test to certify knowledge would solve this.  We do it for drivers&rsquo; licenses and how many litigate that they didn&rsquo;t know red means stop?</p>

		<p>This is my business.  Foreclosures. When we get a home that is in severe default that we need to begin foreclosure proceedings against, there is no where that the race of the owners is indicated.  Foreclosures are completely neutral as to race, it isn&rsquo;t in the file anywhere.  If there is an inordinantly high level of &#8220;black&#8221; foreclosures, what does that tell us?</p>
<p>It tells us that all things being equal, blacks cannot handle the commitments of a long-term financial contract as well as whites can.  Expecting blacks to perform under contract and fulfill obligations with the same commitment that whites do is ludicrous but we all have to do it and take the losses anyway.  </p>
<p>I fully expect that at some point a pin-headed liberal will get together with Jesse or Al and decide that we do have to take in to account the race and will not be able to foreclose against blacks in a higher percentage than whites.  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>By way of further note, recently, a lot of blacks have been contacting us claiming that they haven&rsquo;t been paying their mortgage because &#8220;Obama passed a law taking care of that.&#8221; I was going to end by saying, &#8220;unbelievable&#8221;&hellip;. unfortunately it&rsquo;s so common that it is not &#8220;unbelievable&#8221; any longer. <br>

		<p>Here in Chicago a lot of the Black foreclosures go back to when the Obamanation and his employers at ACORN were pressuring banks to give loans to people who everyone knew could not meet the payments, under terms which made no financial sense whatsoever  &mdash;  no down payment, adjustable rates, interest only, etc.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the banks, Barry, if you want to know who caused the economic crisis; just look in the mirror.</p>

		<p>As pointed out on VDare by Steve Sailer and his &#8220;Diversity Depression&#8221; these banks were pressured to make loans by the government, and the situation got worse under each administration since Carter and the meltdown happened under Bush.  It&rsquo;s been more than a few months and I don&rsquo;t have such facts memorized as it is quite a bit to follow but due to the miracles of the web here is a link to Taki&rsquo;s site with the same essay&hellip;</p>

Similar to providing loans to people who can&rsquo;t afford them, <br>
the Cuyahoga (Cleveland) Metropolitan Housing Authority has a program to allow Section 8 recipients to own their own home. This doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a well thought out program. The reason these people are on Section 8 is because they are unable to manage their own affairs. Operating a storm window is too complex a task for many of them. How are they going to maintain an entire home? It is however an opportunity to hire a department full of blacks at inflated salaries to run the program.</p>

<p>These banks only lent money to redlined (henceforth known as sub-prime) lenders because the U.S., state and municipal gov&rsquo;ts forced them to.  Of course said banks knew that the recipients would not pay them back.  Tha U.S. gov&rsquo;t paid them back.  Yes, you.</p>

		<p>Racial preference legislation which forces businesses to ignore sound business practice weakens that business, corrupts domestic productivity, and inevitably burdens all taxpayers through increased government substitution in the private economy.</p>
<p>Before Obama, this effect was brought about by well-meaning government stupidity. Now, as part of a larger plan to usurp every area of private strength in America and change this country into an all-encompassing socialist state, the Obama administration is pursuing this and many other premeditated destructive objectives deliberately.</p>

		<p>The Marxist Media has lied and censored the actual truth about the mortgage meltdown: <br>
It was caused exclusively by the Marxist group ACORN in the 1970&rsquo;s who began threatening and extorting banks for not &#8220;giving&#8221; loans to unqualified minorities. The congressional traitors got in on the act and passed the &#8220;Housing Reinvestment Act&#8221; that FORCED banks to give bad loans. By 2005 or so, Freddie Mac was Mandated to have fully 52 percent of all it&rsquo;s loans be &#8220;bad&#8221; loans. The Feds threatened to shut down any banks that didn&rsquo;t go along with it. So they did. Then they repackaged the bad loans and got rid of them. The Feds also told them they&rsquo;d be reimbursed if the loans went bad. <br>
Then the whole rotten thing collapsed when enough people got in over their heads. <br>
THAT is what has brought Americans to their knees: Marxists, ACORN and their fellow liars, the Marxist Media. <br>

<p>Almost uniformly, banks wanted 20% down.  The reason for that is that you started the mortgage with 20% equity in the house.  That was your incentive to make the payments, assuming you had the money to   &mdash;   if you didn&rsquo;t make the payments, bank forecloses and you lose all you equity.  Another reason is that it gave the bank protection against non-payers in times of falling real estate values.  Since the loan is 80% or less of the selling price, this means that even if you make no payments and the bank forecloses, they only need to sell the house for 80% of what you &#8220;bought&#8221; it for in order to break even.  Vets/VA loans didn&rsquo;t need 20% down, in fact it was under 10%, but it was presumed that a Vet was as good as his word.  Back in the days when the Armed Forces had standards.</p>
<p>It was foolhardy to eviscerate down payment standards. </p>
<p>Another element of the subprime circus was that monthly payment to gross income ratios were ignored.  The old number was 28%, meaning your mortgage pmt couldn&rsquo;t be more than 28% of your monthly gross income.  During the height of the circus, that number was effectively in the 60s percent, and many people don&rsquo;t net 65% of their gross b/c of taxes.  For everyone else, a 60% of gross mortgage payment means almost 100% of net, meaning no money left over for anything else.  Those standards have returned, but now they&rsquo;re in the low to mid 30s; IMHO they should go down to at least 28.  Also, you pretty much used to have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to the banker what your income was, but that, too, was ignored.  </p>
<p>Put all this together, with people getting approved for increasingly larger mortgages with no income verification and no down payment, you can see why home values surged from the late 1990s to 2006.  A lot of people are cringing that they are decreasing, and Obama&rsquo;s first time homebuyer tax credit seems to be buffering the decline, but only while the credit lasts.  Truth is, home values need to keep declining, b/c they never should have been that high to begin with.  It&rsquo;s not good for the native born white American working class, and for the concept of affordable family formation for the same, that the median housing price in, eg, the San Fernando Valley, soared from 150 to 600 from 1997 to 2007.  I also tend to think that a lot of this mortgage money approved to illegal alien cherry pickers, getting $720g loans on a $14g a year salary (supposedly), some of those 720 Gs were remitted to Mexico.</p>
