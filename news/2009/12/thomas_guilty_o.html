<h1>Thomas Guilty on 38 Counts: Jury to Consider Punishment Today in Death Penalty Case</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, December 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The same jury that deemed George Thomas criminally responsible for the January 2007 slayings of a Knox County couple today will return to decide his fate.</p>
<p>The seven-woman, five-man jury from Hamilton County took less than seven hours to return a sweeping set of guilty verdicts Tuesday against Thomas for the litany of crimes committed against Channon Christian, 21, and Christopher Newsom, 23.</p>
<p>Those convictions included first-degree murder, felony murder, robbery, kidnapping and rape.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas is the third of four defendants convicted in the case. Ringleader Lemaricus Davidson was sentenced to death after his October trial. Davidson&rsquo;s brother, Letalvis Cobbins, escaped death after his August trial and instead was sentenced to life without parole.</p>
<p>Unlike Davidson and Cobbins, who faced a mountain of forensic evidence, the case against Thomas seemed in jeopardy at the outset. Prosecutors had no DNA, no fingerprints and no eyewitnesses. Thomas had conceded he was inside Davidson&rsquo;s Chipman Street house where the couple was held captive but insisted he did nothing more than smoke marijuana and bide time until he could leave.</p>
<p>Dillard and Johnson contended Thomas&rsquo; presence and failure to act was not enough to meet the legal requirements of the criminal responsibility law, which allows a defendant to be rendered equally guilty of crimes committed by another if he or she benefited from the crimes and either aided or attempted to aid the perpetrators.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Each of the defendants in the case have blamed the others. Davidson said Thomas and Cobbins were the killers. Cobbins blamed Davidson as the instigator but also accused Thomas and suspect Eric Boyd in the killing of Newsom. Boyd has not been charged in the slayings. Suspect Vanessa Coleman, who could face trial next year, blamed Thomas in Newsom&rsquo;s slaying and Davidson in Christian&rsquo;s death. Thomas blamed Boyd, Davidson and Cobbins.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The third of Channon Christian&rsquo;s and Christopher Newsom&rsquo;s killers convicted.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the hate crime designation is still denied by the liars in the prosecutor&rsquo;s office.  With those charges included, they  would be the necessary additional factors to guarantee the death penalty.</p>
<p>One or more of them might get reduced sentences because of that.</p>
<p>And the reasoning for not including them?  Well, one of the perps had a white girlfriend so black lust to these mentally challenged incompetents translates to liking whites and being unbiased.  Absolutely amazing. </p>

		<p>Lemaricus Davidson, the ringleader, had a white girlfriend who dumped him on Friday.  On Sunday he abducted, tortured, raped and murdered a young white couple.  </p>
<p>There is no question it was a hate crime.  </p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned the MSM&rsquo;s refusal to report on this crime or the trials is another hate crime.</p>

<p>here&rsquo;s an example of black &#8220;solidarity,&#8221; which falls apart the moment one of them can get ahead by screwing the others. </p>

		<p>Prosecutors routinely throw the book at perps, except in the case of avoiding the racism bugaboo.  If some white man in the Old South was accused of a murder spree directed at blacks, would anyone think the killings weren&rsquo;t hate crimes because he had a black mistress?</p>

		<p>Well, let us hope that the jury will decide that the death sentence is appropriate for this thug.  There has not been one word out of any of the talking heads on TV about this ongoing trial.  I believe that I wrote an email to Lou Dobbs once asking him why he didn&rsquo;t devote at least five minutes to the murder and rape of Channon Christian and Chris Newsom but of course it never happened.  All of these commentators such as Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, Sean Hannity, to my knowledge have never mentioned the case whatsoever.  I wonder when white people will ever wake up to the fact that as far as these elites are concerned, we don&rsquo;t matter, except when it comes to being cannon fodder in these so-called &#8216;nation building&rsquo; wars.  Then we are welcomed in open arms.  Let four white police officers be executed and Chris Matthews calls them &#8216;coppers&rsquo; on his show with his disgusting smile and spittle running down his chin.  Who knows&hellip;..maybe he got that tingling feeling down his leg as he does when Pres. Obama speaks.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Ranger - the rape and torture angle certainly qualify Thomas for an &#8220;extreme indifference to human life&#8221; special circumstance attached to his murder convictions.  A death penalty seems fairly likely in that light.</p>

		<p>With no forensic, fingerprint, or DNA evidence, it sounds like the cops and DA have a pretty weak case against this character.  They may get him for B&E; but unless he used a condom during the rape he might just be innocent of the rape, murder, kidnapping, and other charges.</p>
<p>In any event, even if he&rsquo;s convicted of all charges, his case will be appealed until he finally expires on death row or at the hands of the Aryan Nation in the prison yard.</p>

		<p>There were more people that participated in this crime than has been arrested. The fact is that sperm from two individuals that have not been identified was found on Channon. That house that was used to imprison Channon and Christopher was a crack house with many dopers coming and going. You can bet a lot more people knew about what was happening than those arrested.   </p>

		<p>This sounds like a Amos &amp; Andy routine.</p>
<p>George said that Letalvis did it. Letalvis said that Lemaricus did it. Lemaricus said that Eric did it but Eric said that Vanessa did it, and finally Venessa said that George did it. A full circle and then some. Always that way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have been there, but I didn&rsquo;t do nothing to nobody not no way no how!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Always that way.<br>

<p>And this is the sorry excuse the prosecutor used to deny the hate crime charge.  Because Davidson had a white girlfriend.  I wonder what she thinks of her boyfriend now?  Did she breath a huge sign of relief that it could have been her?  Has this taught her a very important lesson?  Probably not.  But the fact remains that because Davidson had a white girlfriend excuses him from hate crime charges, is just ludicrious and it didn&rsquo;t help that one of the victims parents immediately after the murders occured told the newspaper and media that they didn&rsquo;t believe their this a hate crime.  Were they afraid - who knows?  I know if it were my child, I would be shouting hate crime from the roof because that&rsquo;s exactly what this was, nothing less.<br>

		<p>Nothing satisfies, there is nothing that can truly give or bring closure to this story.  If there was some indication that whites in general were learning something there might be a little, but nothing changes, except the increased pressure on whites to tolerate any and all abuse.</p>

		<p>I can not fathom the horror my brother and sister went thru with these unholy monsters. It&rsquo;s sad to see these insects in court. There should be a televised public execution with a mace and, machete, and &#8220;make sure they see it coming!&#8221; Lakeview senior, you are without question right about the media cowards. To me, they are not even men. &#8220;H&#8221;</p>

		<p>Some good news about the pair of rapists who left DNA inside Channon Christian is that if they are ever convicted of a violent state crime or ANY federal crime, they will be required to produce DNA samples that will link them to the rape/murder.  There is no statute of limitations on murder.</p>

		<p>  In a just society what these animals did to this white couple would be done to them. However, there should be developed &#8220;execution androids&#8221; that could be programmed to administer the punishing death sentence. This way there would be no hand-wringing about &#8220;lowering oneself to their level&#8221; As far as televising it; it might prove instructive to the barbarous elements in society.</p>

		<p>I still think the only rational and just punishment is to read publicly the details of their demonic crimes and then tie them to stakes and burn them alive. The relatives of the victims can be offered the choice of the lighting the first match. <br>
