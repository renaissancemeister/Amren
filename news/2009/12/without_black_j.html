<h1>Without Black Judges, Blind Spots Exist</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James V. Cook, Tallahassee.com, November 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Since then [the author&rsquo;s youth], I&rsquo;ve spent time in multiracial countries such as Brazil and Cuba, where black and white people don&rsquo;t routinely cluster together by race to the extent we still do here.</p>
<p>In the Leon County Courthouse, though, I am a minority. There, the vast majority of faces in most courtrooms are black and brown. Predictably, most of the few faces in the front of the courtroom  &mdash;  the lawyers, clerks and judges  &mdash;  are white. The idea that, when the judge looking down from the bench is always white and the defendant down below is usually black, even-handed justice will routinely prevail is the epitome of naive idealism.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there has only ever been one African-American circuit judge in the 185-year history of Leon County. And while an African-American judge certainly does not guarantee justice for the huge numbers of African-Americans who are swept into the county&rsquo;s legal system, it does almost inevitably introduce a set of experiences into the community of circuit judges that can be of tremendous value in removing substantial blind spots in the system.</p>
<p>Circuit judges live in a different world. They make $145,000 a year in Florida, which puts them among the top tenth of lawyers in pay. They enter the courthouse through a gated parking garage and work behind a great many protective barriers. They are given almost total immunity from lawsuits for their judicial actions. Add to that fact that all the circuit judges in the Second Judicial Circuit are white, and it&rsquo;s not fair to my clients, or to me as their lawyer.</p>
<p>The judges we have may (or may not) be great legal scholars. They may have graduated at the top of their law school classes. I don&rsquo;t know. But I want more than that. Sometimes, to paraphrase Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a wise person of color can make a better decision because of a richer store of experience. {snip}</p>
<p>We have a number of qualified African-American lawyers in the Second Judicial Circuit who could bring credit to our courts. Let&rsquo;s put one of them on the circuit bench. Soon.</p>

		<p>I should say that things are bad in Tallahassee, if city officials are going around and &#8220;sweeping up&#8221; random blacks and taking them off to court.  That they might have committed a crime doesn&rsquo;t seem to figure into Mr. Cook&rsquo;s analysis.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how black judges have worked out in St. Louis   &mdash;   One in five first time armed robbers in St. Louis City get probation only.  A few of those come from plea deals with the Circuit Attorney&rsquo;s office, but most come from a judge&rsquo;s sentencing.  Of those, most of those come from black judges.  And since 98% of all criminal defendants in St. Louis City are black, it&rsquo;s that or more of the universe of first time armed robbers.</p>

		<p>Well, if I, me, myself, wanted to stand in front of a black judge, I would simply move to _____ (fill in the blank with your favorite black run country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, might I suggest that blacks who don&rsquo;t want to face a majority white justice system ought to either STOP committing crimes, or keep their crimes in THEIR neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>So basically what this guy wants is a biased black judge who will rule more in his favor because he is black as is most of his clients. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter to him that these white judges have earned their positions with hard work and study. I wish he would have elaborated a bit more on the so called blind spots in the system. The law is the law. By this guys logic, any black judge should not be allowed to judge a white person either, because they have not shared the same life experiences. And that has WHAT to do with the law? When guys like this write such nonsense, it&rsquo;s no wonder there are few black judges.</p>
<p>And BTW Mr. Cook, the huge number of African Americans are NOT &#8220;swept&#8221; into the legal system. They walked there by their OWN CHOICES. GOT IT? With all the social programs and special treatment blacks get in this day and age, the excuses are getting a little thin aren&rsquo;t they? Thus your call for more black judges. Typical. Blame white judges for black criminal behavior.</p>

		<p>I have a great idea for you, Mr. Cook. You and your people all get your own state or country and you will have nothing but black judges, juries, and defendants. Then people like you can&rsquo;t yell racism ever again and blame Whitey and then you and yours will have to suffer and not US, if you want the black criminals released and found not guilty, right? I will help you pack.</p>

		<p> Behold, the White liberal: He hates himself, he hates his race. Others have &#8220;richer&#8221; experiences to bring to the table. White judges, by definition, cannot be fair to black defendants. He missed so very, very much by not going to a school where he could be harassed and hassled by black thugs   &mdash;   er, fellow students.</p>
<p> Poor, poor Mr. Cook   &mdash;   so deprived as a child by not being allowed to sample America&rsquo;s wonderful diversity in all its multi-colored glory. And to make matters worse, his poor Danish grandmother, God rest her misguided soul, was PREJUDICED! Oh, the shame of it all!</p>
<p> OK. We could assume that this defense attorney, who looks in his photo as if he&rsquo;s never had a happy day in his life, could just be pulling our legs here. He could surprise us with a final sentence that says, &#8220;JUST KIDDING!&#8221; But defense attorneys aren&rsquo;t famous for their sense of humor   &mdash;   especially when it comes to the causes dear to the heart of the left.</p>
<p> No, Mr. Cook is dead serious in writing this tripe. America may have been cruel to him in depriving him of the (dubious) company of blacks as he grew up; but I think Mother Nature was even more cruel: She deprived him of common sense.</p>

<p>And that &ldquo;richer store of experience&rdquo; need not be attached to &ldquo;a wise person of color&rdquo; with excellent qualifications and a honestly obtained academic record, but a mediocrity with a gargantuan chip on his or her shoulder and a burning hatred for whitey and the USA. Right, Comrade Cook?</p>
<p>Once again, we have the common spectacle of an Affirmative Action recipient, demanding that more such atrocities be committed and the legal system further eroded, so that he (or someone just like him) might dubiously gain some mental succor and monetary sating in the whole sorry folly. It is a childishly spoiled mindset in operation here, that has been tolerated for far too long in this country. Blacks and others &ldquo;of color&rdquo; need to be told flat out, the party is over; take the goodie bags that you have and be thankful we are letting you keep them.</p>
<p>If they persist in this nonsense, if the demands and threats escalate, then perhaps the time has come to redress the situation more comprehensively. Such as reviewing all degrees and certifications obtained through Affirmative Action programming against the generally accepted standards of the white population as a whole, and removing minority &ldquo;achievements&rdquo; that do not meet these minimal standards.</p>
<p>We might just call such a program, Restrictive Reaction!       </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if anyone has given any thought to the concept of a white demographic shift to select regions of north america. Sort of like urban white flight but en masse.  This would leave the colored to their own devices and their own set of standards by which to follow.  I think in no time it would be clear to even the most hardened of leftists that blacks are authors of their own misfortune and that without propping up by whites, they&rsquo;re basically unfit to produce a reasonable quality of life for themselves.  This is probably obvious to some but just a suggestion.</p>

		<p>My impression is that Mr. Cook is mentally ill. Be that as it may, perhaps he can move to Somalia and be a lawyer there - where he can have even a &#8220;richer experience.&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure his winning the prestigious NAACP Foot Soldiers Award will help him achieve a spot on the bench there before he is eaten.</p>

		<p>Having never been to law school (or jail) I don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience with the legal system. But I do have a few nuggets of common sense to share. 85% of whites are murdered by other whites. And 94% of blacks are murdered by other blacks. Therefore if a judge fails to do the right thing because they want to cut someone a break based on race then they aren&rsquo;t really doing that race a favor. Even when a defendant comes to trial for crimes against someone of another race it&rsquo;s not wise to give them a break. Because my guess is that someone who would commit crimes against another race probably would (and probably HAS) committed crimes against their own. And probably will again. It&rsquo;s never a good idea to cut criminals a break because of their race or the race of their victims. My guess is that white judges know this. And that&rsquo;s a good thing. I&rsquo;ll leave it to the reader to decide whether black judges do.</p>

		<p>Yet, in majority black cities, where white defendants invariably come before &#8216;minority&rsquo; judges, the shameless call there, from sensitive folks just like Mr. James Cook, is for exactly even more minority empowerment and black pride. Especially in &#8216;minority&rsquo; areas.   </p>

		<p>No, Mr. Cook.  Blacks are not &#8220;swept into the justice system.&#8221;  They commit serious crimes at several times the level of other ethnic groups.  That&rsquo;s it.  But I do believe that blacks need their own justice system, along with their own society completely free of whites.  They can have the rule of law, or anarchy, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me.</p>

		<p>Down here in South Africa, we have a black judge (Judge Motata, Google him) who was convicted of drunk driving the other day.  Drove his Jaguar into a guys garden wall.  He is on tape (cellphone video) saying how he hates f&hellip;..ing whites etc.  The racial abuse that came out of his mouth was unbelievable.  Imagine a white person appearing before a judge who is on record stating that he hates whites.  Go figure.</p>

		<p>I fully agree with blacks having black judges. It would also stand to reason that whites should have white judges. Blacks should have their own legal system in their own country. If a white man is dumb enough to venture into a black country he would be at the mercy of their legal system. </p>
<p>Blacks want segregation as much as we do but they just want us to pay for it. Blacks would be happy living by themselves if the checks keep rolling in. </p>

		<p>In nine years of being sued I have stood before eleven judges.<br>
Ten were white, the other black. Only the Black judge found, correctly, in my favor.  </p>
<p>I have observed that eight of the ten white judges are corrupt to bone and I practically despair for the future because of it.</p>
<p>The most corrupt judge, a white woman, was very easy and very polite on the criminals brought before her.  She screamed at me several times during my proceedings threatening me, a civil defendant, with jail if I did not maintain 100% silence while my white lawyer sold me out to the plaintiff&rsquo;s white lawyer.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong&hellip; only paying the courts.</p>

		<p>Cook&rsquo;s clear implication that blacks are treated more harshly than other by white judges seems highly improbable.</p>
<p>Blacks are far more likely to be multiple offenders than people of any other race or ethnicity, making it much more likely that blacks convicted of any given crime will, in fact, receive harsher sentences that your average white for the same offense. This is not discrimination at work but merely the proper application of standard sentencing guidlines.</p>

<p>Mr. Cook is fabricating lies. Contra this civil rights &#8220;foot soldier,&#8221; Latin American countries are stridently segregated - by choice - which is the natural order of things in a truly free society. Anyone who has spent time in Brazil knows that you can go days without seeing a black person, at least in the nicer areas of the country. Rio ain&rsquo;t Brazil, and vice versa. </p>

		<p>Then its not fair for a white person to be tried by a Black Judge.  Whites should not have blacks on a jury.  Chinese people should only get tried by Chinese Judges.  Moslems by Moslem judges too.  Blacks should not be allowed to vote for whites.  So there we go.</p>
