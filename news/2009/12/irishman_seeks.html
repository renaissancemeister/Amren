			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Irish Times, December 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A YEAR after the crime, Séamus T&rsquo;s voice still quivers when he recalls how he found his daughter Erin, then 15, lying on the roadside [in Gaithersburg, Maryland] on the night of January 3rd, 2009.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy, Daddy, get them off me,&#8221; she kept moaning. The girl was semi-conscious, and was soaking wet because her assailants had put her under a shower to wash vomit and menstrual blood off her after they gang-raped her.</p>
<p>Séamus T, an Irishman who left Dublin 25 years ago, continues his job as an executive in a mechanical contracting firm, but he has spent much of the past year seeking justice for Erin.</p>
<p>The ordeal started as a cosy reunion of three high-school girls after the holidays. Séamus T dropped his daughter off at an apartment in Gaithersburg, Maryland, at 8.30pm, and was to have picked her up three hours later.</p>
<p>Boys showed up at the party. &#8220;They gave her &#8216;jungle juice&rsquo;, 100 per cent grain alcohol,&#8221; Séamus T explains. Doctors at Shady Grove hospital later found Erin had almost three times the legal limit in her blood.</p>
<p>Three teenagers, then aged 16 and 17, planned the rape. One waited in the bathroom while the other two dragged Erin in. When the district attorney read through the medical report at a seven-hour hearing on September 30th, Erin&rsquo;s family heard how the attackers tore flesh on three of the girl&rsquo;s body orifices. She banged her head when she fell against the bath tub, and was covered in bruises.</p>
<p>Had the three young men not boasted of their crime, they would not have been identified, because Erin cannot remember the rape. They were arrested in late February, spent a couple of months in jail, and were freed pending the hearing.</p>
<p>Erin was taunted by other students, who accused her of &#8220;snitching&#8221;&rsquo; on the rapists. The girl was so traumatised that she slept with her mother or older sister until she went to live with relatives in Nevada, at her request.</p>
<p>The case shifted from adult to juvenile court, and Séamus T learned in September that two of the three rapists were back at Magruder High School. He filed a complaint with the board of education, and succeeded in having them transferred.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter was the only white kid at the party,&#8221; Séamus T says.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think the attack was racially motivated, but there were racial and class undertones in the courtroom. On one side you had the three rapists, an aunt and two single mothers, all African-Americans. On the other side, everyone was white and middle class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Montgomery county circuit court judge Steven Salant so enraged Séamus T that he filed a complaint with the Maryland Commission on Judicial Disabilities, the body that disciplines judges, on the grounds his daughter &#8220;was not treated with dignity and respect&#8221; as required by the state constitution.</p>
<p>Salant did not respond to The Irish Times&rsquo;s request for comment, which was made through the court&rsquo;s spokesman.</p>
<p>Séamus T says Salant blamed the victim and made excuses for the rapists, who he sentenced to probation only. As recounted by the Gaithersburg Gazette newspaper, the judge described the gang-rape as &#8220;horrific&#8221;, but focused on Erin&rsquo;s behaviour on the night of the party.</p>
<p>The victim was drunk and &#8220;engaged in risky and provocative behaviour&#8221; such as sitting on people&rsquo;s laps and talking about &#8220;hooking up&#8221;, Salant said in court. &#8220;This was a disaster waiting to happen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was a dynamic at work here.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were things going on here. It doesn&rsquo;t make the respondents any less worthy of blame, but what it does mean is I have to determine whether what we have here is sexual predators or respondents who .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did not get that when a girl is intoxicated and presents herself in that manner you do not take advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were devastated as a family. We were destroyed,&#8221; says Séamus T.</p>
<p>&#8220;We went to court expecting some compassion. The system is upside down and backwards. The judge was worried about the rapists staying in school, getting evaluated, getting counselling and transportation. Everything is lavished on them. Nobody knocked on my door and said, &#8216;I&rsquo;ll show you through the system&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Séamus T&rsquo;s appeals to first lady Michelle Obama, Maryland governor Martin O&rsquo;Malley and state attorney John McCarthy have gone unanswered. He was treated with kindness by the Irish Embassy, which promised to intervene if he felt he was not being treated as a US citizen would be.</p>
<p>The state legislature has provided the most hope of redress.</p>
<p>Kathleen Dumais, a Maryland state delegate, and Nancy King, a Maryland state senator, have taken up the case. Dumais is drafting legislation that would ban juvenile sex offenders from attending normal public schools and place their names on a register. If passed, it may be called Erin&rsquo;s law.<br>

		<p>I hate to &#8220;blame the victim,&#8221; but if you act like a whore, you should not be surprised to be treated like a whore. Getting drunk and teasing a bunch of colored riff-raff with no impulse control is akin to sticking your hand into the tiger&rsquo;s cage. Not a bright idea.</p>
<p>And if you place yourself in the company of colored folks, you should not be surprised that they act like colored folks are known to act. If the father knew that his daughter would have anything to do with a bunch of primitives, he should have whipped her butt.</p>
<p>All this being said, the rapists need to hang for their deeds. I know that it will not happen, but it sure ought to.</p>

<p>Is there any doubt that &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; is synonymous with low-grade ethnic cleansing and terrorism of whites in this country?</p>
<p>And if you want to live separately, in relative safety, you&rsquo;re called a racist. That&rsquo;s how upside down things have become.</p>

		<p>I also read the original article, as Séamus T says, &ldquo;My daughter was the only white kid at the party.&rdquo; </p>
<p>No mention of the non-white &ldquo;girlfriends&rdquo; coming to Erwin&rsquo;s help or their &ldquo;ratting&rdquo; on the rapists.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help think that perhaps that the non-white &ldquo;girlfriends&rdquo; set up Erwin.<br>
 <br>
I can&rsquo;t understand how a father would be so foolish (stupid) to drop off his daughter for a reunion &ldquo;party&rdquo; with her non-White &ldquo;girlfriends&rdquo;-just read the newspapers-listen to the radio/TV/internet-open your ears/eyes!</p>
<p>The &#8220;judge&#8221; is even worse than the rapists.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sissy White&rsquo;s daughters don&rsquo;t go to non-white parties or &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; race parties-and they don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Sissy White&rsquo;s daughters are not sissies, are not afraid of knives and know how to use firearms since they were 7 as the kids/parents in our neighborhood and the kids, White and non-white at their school know. (Non-whites avoid my daughters.)<br>

		<p>I feel sorry for dad and his daughter, but why did this fool drop his daughter off at an all black party? What were the two other girls doing this whole time? Egging on the attackers? I also think this girl had a bit of the &#8216;jungle fever&rsquo; if she wanted to hang out with blacks. Maybe her jungle fever is cured now? </p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the attack was racially motivated&hellip;..&#8221;</p>
<p>Sad to say, we have parents out there who are not only clueless about racial reality, but continue to deny the obvious AFTER the heinous crime has been comitted.  Poor kid.<br>

		<p>Well, in the final analysis it was the parents who are responsible for not warning their daughter about associating with blacks, because the leftist school administrators certainly are going to encourage black/white socializing, and any kid needs a strong parental influence to sit down and explain the facts of life, the most important being that the vast majority of blacks are primitives and are prone to crime and violence, especially rape.</p>
<p>A copy of the US Dept of Justice&rsquo;s stats would be helpful to show them also.</p>

		<p>This judge should be removed from office.  We do not blame the victim of rape anymore, or at least I thought that was the current thinking.  She was stupid but that does not justify brutalizing the girl.  The father is a moron, a clueless moron.  Yet I know other whites too stupid to accept the fact that blacks are dangerous.  I know blacks who are more afraid of other blacks than some stupid whites are.  And where are the women&rsquo;s groups?  If a couple of white girls set up a &#8220;friend&#8221; to be raped by three white boys the women&rsquo;s libbers would be screaming castration.  And did this child have a mother with a brain?  This girl was friends with two &#8220;single&#8221; mothers and their aunt?  I do not think the &#8220;single&#8221; mothers were widowed or divorced, they were whores, and any mother worth her salt would not let her white daughter hang out with two skanks!  Is there NO common sense left in this country?</p>

		<p>Sad as this is, it is the usual conduct of blacks and if she was the only White girl there, she knew what was possible if not invited. This is the only way things end up for a White girl hanging out with  blacks. Perhaps now, we have a few more racially aware Whites to our way of thinking.</p>

<p>I think you are exactly right. Perhaps there should be a &#8220;Committee to Aid White Victims of Interracial Crime.&#8221; </p>
<p>The group could reach out to victims like this girl, or the girl raped in Richmond, to the kids beaten on buses in Missouri, the whites attacked by blacks in Denver, the whites attacked by feral Somalis in Maine and Minneapolis, the parents of the kids raped and murdered in Knoxville, and on and on&hellip; </p>
<p>The group could reach out with whatever financial aid that could be mustered, and more importantly, try to attract the attention these stories deserve, and which the  mainstream media tries to hush.</p>

		<p>Once again another white is victimized by blacks.What is the white community&rsquo;s response? All I hear are the sound of crickets.Where is the outrage?Where is the civil disobedience?Where are the crowds demanding justice? How long will we allow these chidren to be destoyed?If this happened in another era in our history men would be storming the jail to get at these animals.Crowds would be formed to bring attention to this crime.The media could not ignore large crowds of people demanding justice.What will it take to bring whites out into the streets to make a stand? What needs to happen? What is the final insult that will motivate our people to action.Are we sheep to be preyed upon by wolves? Where are the real white men of that community to stand beside the father of that young girl to support him in demandig justice? All I hear are the sounds of crickets.That is why I know up front that when I make my stand I do it alone.Were are our brothers to stand beside in this battle?</p>

<p>Sadly, the father seems to be in denial about what&rsquo;s really going on. Then he illustrates the point by calling attention to the divide in the courtroom. Yes, Seamus, it really is &#8220;us&#8221; against &#8220;them.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The victim was drunk and &ldquo;engaged in risky and provocative behaviour&rdquo; such as sitting on people&rsquo;s laps and talking about &ldquo;hooking up&rdquo;, Salant said in court. &ldquo;This was a disaster waiting to happen&hellip;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>What cold, mean-spirited nonsense! It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the girl was drunk, acting provocatively, had a parent who has displayed ignorance and poor judgement, no means no. The girl was a victim of violence pure and simple. These black boys will rape again. The legal system under judge Salant has given them permission to rape again. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s OK boys to beat and rape all the white women you want as long as you say the women were drunk and leading you on.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As one who lives in the  Wash. DC area it is my opinion that any father who drops his daughter off at an apartment in the seedy Gaithersburg or Germantown area for a party where she is the only white is ignorant and irresponsible beyond belief.  The judge in this case should be removed from the bench.  The poor girl&rsquo;s &#8220;friends&#8221; obviously stood by their &#8220;men&#8221; instead of her, big surprise.</p>
<p>As I stated, I live in the metropolitan region and I had not heard of this case so the local media must have hushed it up when the racial mix of the perps and victim became known.</p>
<p>The father should sue the perps.  That is what Goldman did when the courts did not convict O.J. Simpson.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for the girl and hope she can get her life back together in Nevada.  Better yet, she should move back to Ireland.</p>

		<p>I have to assume that this poor father wasn&rsquo;t aware when he dropped his daughter off that she was attending an all black gathering.</p>
<p>If he was and did it anyway his daughter should be removed from his custody and placed in foster care.  As for the father, he should institutionalized as criminally insane.</p>

		<p>Thank you Preston.  The Irishman didn&rsquo;t grow up around black people in Ireland. How much exposure has he had to them in the United States?  It is only when the demographics of their neighborhood change that white people who grew up in the U.S. often know anything about black people in reality.  How often do you see a movie where any black person in it isn&rsquo;t savior of the world?</p>
<p>My view is equally unbalanced, but it is from things that I saw while growing up in my grandparents&rsquo; custody.  They grew up in very liberal Scandinavia believing that everything could be fixed with enough &#8220;understanding&#8221; or &#8220;love&#8221; or &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; or all that other crud because they grew up among people who valued social harmony.  Then they became diplomats and learned first-hand how Africans behave in Africa.  Most liked to threaten and intimidate during negotiations as if they could not reason.  Maybe some of them couldn&rsquo;t, so why were they sent forth to represent their countries?  Point is that when I came to this country I had seen enough black behavior in their &#8220;natural habitat&#8221; to steer clear of them.  That girl clearly hadn&rsquo;t, and she was only 15.</p>

		<p>Sadly, it may take the brutal rape of most White people&rsquo;s sons and daughters by blacks and hispanics to wake up the parents and the children. </p>
<p>Then again, even this doesn&rsquo;t work all the time. I know of two White women (friend of a friend of a friend) who were raped by blacks and they&rsquo;re still as liberal as ever and see being raped by a black as an isolated incident. They hold no animosity towards minorities and in fact think my and my friends pro-White views are abhorrent and racist. I KID YOU NOT!</p>
<p>It makes me wonder about what it&rsquo;s going to take to wake some people up. I&rsquo;m almost to the point where I just want cut and run and leave these Whites to fend for themselves. I don&rsquo;t want to fight for these people. I don&rsquo;t want to be stabbed in the back while I&rsquo;m defending these traitors.</p>
<p>One thing&rsquo;s for sure, if the system collapses and it becomes every race for themselves, treason by Whites will not be tolerated. These traitors are going to wish they had never been born. I get the feeling that a lot of Whites will be fighting on the side of non-Whites if all hell breaks loose. It&rsquo;s insane.</p>

		<p>Why do they call a 15 year old a girl and not a child? At what age can a person reasonably be expected to understand what drinking pure grain alcohol will do to them? Where did they even get pure grain alcohol? It doesn&rsquo;t appear that anyone at the party was old enough to drink or buy booze so just who furnished the alcohol? </p>
<p>The judge may be right in saying that this was an accident waiting to happen but where is the investitgation into said accident? At the very least there had to be an adult that furnished the alcohol. Someone set this incident in motion and if the young people are not considered responsible then who is at fault? If you have a party at your house and children are found to even be drinking beer then you are normally in trouble.  </p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t want to deal with this as a rape issue then what about all the other laws that were obviously broken. Everything from an unsupervised party where alcohol was served to the fact that a girl was dragged into a bathroom. You can get more than just probation for many minor offenses. </p>
<p>Even old Seamus himself should do a little time for not considering the safety of his daughter. The other Irishmen should beat a little sense into him if nothing else. A man that would leave his daughter with a bunch of blacks deserves a horse whipping. The girl is to young to know better but he isn&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>Insulting or blaming these people is not very productive. Like all kids of this present generation this poor girl was likely taught that it would be &#8220;racist&#8221; to not have friends of all colors and persuasions. To her it probably would not have seemed unusual to be at a party where she was either the only or one of the few White people there. The simple fact was that these poor people had to learn the hard way. I was raised with the correct attitude about dating or befrending blacks but not everyone was and to blame and name call people who are more than likely coming over to our side hurts our cause. If we want to get more people to see the truth about diversity then if someone experiances the worst of it and comes around it makes no sense to kick them while they are down. It is the father and the school system that is truly to blame, but this poor man has been through enough and the school is not going to change. </p>

		<p>A lone white girl or guy at an all black party is at many times greater risk of being a victim of some sort of crime than any of the blacks would be.  She was so young that she wouldn&rsquo;t really understand this.  Her father should have.  He was an absolute fool. I would never have allowed my child to attend a party like this.

I hate to &ldquo;blame the victim,&rdquo; but if you act like a whore, you should not be surprised to be treated like a whore. Getting drunk and teasing a bunch of colored riff-raff with no impulse control is akin to sticking your hand into the tiger&rsquo;s cage. Not a bright idea.</p>
<p>And if you place yourself in the company of colored folks, you should not be surprised that they act like colored folks are known to act. If the father knew that his daughter would have anything to do with a bunch of primitives, he should have whipped her butt.</p>

If you have your kids in a public school then you are unfortunately part of the problem. I would do anything in my power to get my children (especially daughters) either in a nearly all White private school or teach them yourself at home. If you are willing to do without some luxuries just about anyone is able to do so. It is hard but with stories like this one it would be so worth it. </p>

		<p>Not to discredit micks, but anyone who ever watched Bad Boys or remembers Matt Dillon/Sean Penn/Mickey Rourke in their early years knows that for whatever reason, even some 150 years after they hit our shores, Irish-Catholics tend to run the risk of being sucked into an urban white-trash quagmire that puts them at high-risk.  Some factors might be genetic.  There is often violence and dysfunction in the homes of a garden variety-Dad drinks too much and is strict, or beats Mom.  Irish kids will show up for a good fight, but not gunfight.  </p>
<p>And Irish are often like the blacks in that they mature fairly quickly as adolescents, are a fairly sexually sophisticated and hypersexual-possibly the church repression excacerbates this- and they are tough fighters (African-Americans knows this in Chicago or New York and will jump a WASP before a &#8220;Mick&#8221; or &#8220;eye-talian&#8221;).</p>
<p>Most of these things are outgrown, and Irish-Americans will often turn around from a tough adolescence.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Seamus T.&rsquo; has been in this country some 25 years and during all that time never had any idea of what Bantus were like? What was he doing all that time, watching &#8216;The Cosby Show&rsquo;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, this was exactly my thought too. What did this man think goes on in this country? </p>
<p>This Seamus seems to be so surprised about ALL of this. Wake up man! Too late now, however.</p>

		<p>WOW!!  For such an &#8220;anti-MSM&#8221; crowd, a lot of you are sure to believe that she was handing out lap dances.  </p>
<p>&#8220;The victim was drunk and &ldquo;engaged in risky and provocative behaviour&rdquo; such as sitting on people&rsquo;s laps and talking about &ldquo;hooking up&rdquo;&#8221;   -For all we know, she was pushed onto somebodys lap.  For all we know, her &#8220;talking about hooking up&#8221; was NO!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She banged her head when she fell against the bath tub, and was covered in bruises.&#8221;  -are the odds really even that she &#8220;accidentally&#8221; &#8220;banged her head&#8221;?<br>

		<p>The MSM has been waging a deliberate and highly effective psychological war against whites,often times using the malleable hearts and minds of our children against us.</p>
<p>Our children are hammered day by day at school, told that white racial pride and conciousness are evil and that those of Euro descent are required to carry the  &#8220;the white mans burden&#8221;.</p>
<p>The entertainment industry tells our children that white is awkward and nerdy and that black is suave and cool. Interrracial relations on TV and in film are almost always white woman/black man. Black characters are always portryed in an unrealistic positive fashion. Our youngsters eat this up.</p>
<p>As parents we must fight back against the MSM PC diversity lefties and &#8221; Jam the signal&#8221; by monitoring what our kids take in, i.e. radio,music,TV etc etc. and start an indoctrination process our own. We must use wisdom and restraint knowing that undue repression makes all things &#8220;ghetto&#8221; irresistible forbidden fruit to rebellious angst ridden pre-teens and teens.</p>
<p>As a child I loved Bill Cosby and still do, but in regards to my sweetheart 4 yr old daughter I have applied a scorched earth policy in regards to her taking in anything of an Afro-centric nature, being subtle as I do so. I always make sure something else is on when the little Bill show is on.</p>
<p>In summation, contrary to what the Stormfront crowd believes the racial battlefield will not involve a rain of lead and brass,instead it will be in the hearts and minds of our children. Failure is not an option.</p>

		<p>Some obvious puzzles here:</p>
<p>Where did the father of this girl spend the last twenty-plus years?</p>
<p>If he was living and working in or around Washington D.C., his ignorance of racial realities in the U.S.A. is totally inexplicable.</p>
<p>Ditto his daughter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if SHE had grown up in Ireland, her innocence and/or ignorance might be all-too-tragically-explicable; for two decades the Irish have been pumped full of Save-the-Third-World claptrap by the likes of Bono, Geldof and Mrs Mary Robinson.</p>

		<p>And out here in the People&rsquo;s Republik of Kalifornia, one of the suspects in our own version of this story is now &#8220;missing.&#8221; His family is &#8220;very worried,&#8221; according to the propaganda organs.</p>
<p>What goes around, comes around? We&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see. Some of the local toughs in that neighborhood were saying as much, a few days after the event.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone here is rushing to condemn the victim for putting herself in that position; she was after all a 15 year-old child, and children - especially teenagers - sometimes do foolish things.</p>
<p>The real culprits in this story are of course the thugs who raped her after giving her nearly enough alcohol to kill her, and her idiot father, who as a nominal adult, should have (A) known better, and (B) exercised more control.</p>
<p>As WASP Insurgent said, the war is being waged in the hearts and minds of our children.  One very effective method of winning this battle is to homeschool them; this way, your child is not being indoctrinated six hours per day by a left-wing hack masquerading as a teacher.<br>

		<p>51 Raj Patel: We recognize that there are differences between Blacks and Hindus, but that does not mean that we don&rsquo;t also recognize the differences between Whites and Hindus.  Just because we don&rsquo;t want to live in New Africa doesn&rsquo;t mean that we want to live in West India either.  You are India, just as we are America.  Where you go, India goes, and we like our own country better.  You are not American, no matter what the papers issued by our treasonous rulers may say.  Visit us if you like, but go home after you&rsquo;ve seen the sights.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s all the ultra-liberal feminists?<br>
How come they&rsquo;re not standing up&hellip;.Shouldn&rsquo;t they be defending women&rsquo;s rights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it clashes with another tenet of their liberal religion, they&rsquo;re silent. Like with the Terri Schiavo judicial murder four years ago. Alexandra</p>
<p>Good point, race trumps women&rsquo;s rights for contemporary &#8220;gender feminists&#8221;. It&rsquo;s hard to take academic feminists seriously because they only stand up for &#8220;selected&#8221; women&rsquo;s rights. They completely ignore blue collar women or women abused by minorities or hostile minority cultures. <br>

<p>If this idiot senile judge thinks this was in any way consensual, how would one explain the assailants:</p>
<p>Leaving a soaking wet Erin, lying on the roadside in winter (to die).<br>
              <br>

		<p>Good exchange between WASP Insurgent and Michael Scott.</p>
<p>I would like to add the idea that Church is not a help. It supplies contradictory ethics that require an awful lot of effort to convert into a believe in the righteousness of race preservation.  Some here try it, but the actual doctrinal gaps and glaring gaps of logic make such conclusions difficult.  IN a war to save children from propaganda, the understructure must more seamless than this because so much brainwashing must be overcome.  I am suggesting that the clearer and more linear the thought is, the better chance in making the case to race preservation to our young is going to be.</p>

<p>Yes, it WAS interesting information. Indeed.  But did you also read the post by Ben Tillman (#12)?  Judge Salant is the President (of all things!) of a society of lawyers which &#8220;celebrates&#8221; and &#8220;educates&#8221; others regarding their own special values expressed in the law. <br>
  <br>
Sadly, I don&rsquo;t think your informing those officials (such as Judge Salant) of their &#8220;corruption&#8221; is going to impress them very much.  They won&rsquo;t even recognize what you&rsquo;re talking about. </p>
<p>I am quite sure that gentlemen such as Salant consider themselves to be moral paragons who represent enlightenment, social justice, and all the rest of the &#8216;better-than-thou&rsquo;  blah-blah that they flatter themselves with, and use to impress others. And they&rsquo;re very good at it too!  No, you&rsquo;ll be wasting your time.  Judge Salant and his fellow society members will not see it from your point of view at all.</p>
