<h1><a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14742737">The Looming Crisis in Human Genetics</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Geoffrey Miller, The Economist, November 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Human geneticists have reached a private crisis of conscience, and it will become public knowledge in 2010. The crisis has depressing health implications and alarming political ones. In a nutshell: the new genetics will reveal much less than hoped about how to cure disease, and much more than feared about human evolution and inequality, including genetic differences between classes, ethnicities and races.</p>
<p>About five years ago, genetics researchers became excited about new methods for &#8220;genome-wide association studies&#8221; (GWAS). We already knew from twin, family and adoption studies that all human traits are heritable: genetic differences explain much of the variation between individuals. We knew the genes were there; we just had to find them. Companies such as Illumina and Affymetrix produced DNA chips that allowed researchers to test up to 1m genetic variants for their statistical association with specific traits. America&rsquo;s National Institutes of Health and Britain&rsquo;s Wellcome Trust gave huge research grants for gene-hunting. Thousands of researchers jumped on the GWAS bandwagon. Lab groups formed and international research consortia congealed. The quantity of published GWAS research has soared.</p>
<p>In 2010, GWAS fever will reach its peak. Dozens of papers will report specific genes associated with almost every imaginable trait  &mdash;  intelligence, personality, religiosity, sexuality, longevity, economic risk-taking, consumer preferences, leisure interests and political attitudes. The data are already collected, with DNA samples from large populations already measured for these traits. It&rsquo;s just a matter of doing the statistics and writing up the papers for Nature Genetics. The gold rush is on throughout the leading behaviour-genetics centres in London, Amsterdam, Boston, Boulder and Brisbane.</p>
<p>GWAS researchers will, in public, continue trumpeting their successes to science journalists and Science magazine. They will reassure Big Pharma and the grant agencies that GWAS will identify the genes that explain most of the variation in heart disease, cancer, obesity, depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and ageing itself. Those genes will illuminate the biochemical pathways underlying disease, which will yield new genetic tests and blockbuster drugs. Keep holding your breath for a golden age of health, happiness and longevity.</p>
<p>In private, though, the more thoughtful GWAS researchers are troubled. They hold small, discreet conferences on the &#8220;missing heritability&#8221; problem: if all these human traits are heritable, why are GWAS studies failing so often? The DNA chips should already have identified some important genes behind physical and mental health. They simply have not been delivering the goods.</p>
<p>Certainly, GWAS papers have reported a couple of hundred genetic variants that show statistically significant associations with a few traits. But the genes typically do not replicate across studies. Even when they do replicate, they never explain more than a tiny fraction of any interesting trait. In fact, classical Mendelian genetics based on family studies has identified far more disease-risk genes with larger effects than GWAS research has so far.</p>
<p>Why the failure? The missing heritability may reflect limitations of DNA-chip design: GWAS methods so far focus on relatively common genetic variants in regions of DNA that code for proteins. They under-sample rare variants and DNA regions translated into non-coding RNA, which seems to orchestrate most organic development in vertebrates. Or it may be that thousands of small mutations disrupt body and brain in different ways in different populations. At worst, each human trait may depend on hundreds of thousands of genetic variants that add up through gene-expression patterns of mind-numbing complexity.</p>
<p><b>Political science</b></p>
<p>We will know much more when it becomes possible to do cheap &#8220;resequencing&#8221;  &mdash;  which is really just &#8220;sequencing&#8221; a wider variety of individuals beyond the handful analysed for the Human Genome Project. Full sequencing means analysing all 3 billion base pairs of an individual&rsquo;s DNA rather than just a sample of 1m genetic variants as the DNA chips do. When sequencing costs drop within a few years below $1,000 per genome, researchers in Europe, China and India will start huge projects with vast sample sizes, sophisticated bioinformatics, diverse trait measures and detailed family structures. (American bioscience will prove too politically squeamish to fund such studies.) The missing heritability problem will surely be solved sooner or later.</p>
<p>The trouble is, the resequencing data will reveal much more about human evolutionary history and ethnic differences than they will about disease genes. Once enough DNA is analysed around the world, science will have a panoramic view of human genetic variation across races, ethnicities and regions. We will start reconstructing a detailed family tree that links all living humans, discovering many surprises about mis-attributed paternity and covert mating between classes, castes, regions and ethnicities.</p>
<p>We will also identify the many genes that create physical and mental differences across populations, and we will be able to estimate when those genes arose. Some of those differences probably occurred very recently, within recorded history. Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending argued in &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion&#8221; that some human groups experienced a vastly accelerated rate of evolutionary change within the past few thousand years, benefiting from the new genetic diversity created within far larger populations, and in response to the new survival, social and reproductive challenges of agriculture, cities, divisions of labour and social classes. Others did not experience these changes until the past few hundred years when they were subject to contact, colonisation and, all too often, extermination.</p>
<p>If the shift from GWAS to sequencing studies finds evidence of such politically awkward and morally perplexing facts, we can expect the usual range of ideological reactions, including nationalistic retro-racism from conservatives and outraged denial from blank-slate liberals. The few who really understand the genetics will gain a more enlightened, live-and-let-live recognition of the biodiversity within our extraordinary species  &mdash;  including a clearer view of likely comparative advantages between the world&rsquo;s different economies.<br>

		<p>This is something that AR has forecasted for a very long time   &mdash;   that the HGF would show more racial differences than genetic sequencing of diseases.  So I think that establishment &#8220;scientists&#8221; will simply ignore genetics, and come up with some bromide why they don&rsquo;t matter, all the while inventing some sort of smear for those who say they matter, just like they themselves said they did 10-20 years ago.</p>

		<p>Science is now political and politically corrupt.  Dr. Watson and the recent revelations about the scam by scientists regarding global warming have already revealed that to us.</p>
<p>Any information not deemed politically correct coming out of any scientific field in the near future will be clouded with lies and manipulation of facts.  Something like the &#8220;Flynn&#8221; effect.</p>
<p>Science does not lie, but scientists concoct lies.  Right now they&rsquo;re somewhere down near politicians and used car salesmen.</p>

		<p>Why is it that the &#8220;few who really understand the genetics will gain a more enlightened, live-and-let-live recognition of of the biodiversity within our extraordinary species&#8221;?  Wouldn&rsquo;t these people gain instead a recognition that some groups are a drain on any modern society?  That the Reds have worked to increase their number, and to reduce the number of people capable of contributing to our societies?  Would they not gain an understanding that billions of dim witted humans pose a risk to the environment as great as any other predicted catastrophe?  Will they not gain the understanding that a society that devotes the efforts of many of its most intelligent women to caring for the offspring of the much less intelligent, instead of their own offspring, will have more dumb people and fewer smart ones?  <br>
     In the end, he&rsquo;s half right.  The leftists will deny the truth, but thinking people will all soon become &#8220;retro-racists&#8221;.    </p>

		<p>I always thought that the beauty of natural science was that it contained universal truths, which could not be overriden. For example, no judge, nation or international body can bang a gavel or pass a resolution saying that gold is equal to roentgenium, or that a giraffe is equal to an okapi.</p>
<p>Only with humans, do we pretend that all races, cultures, societies, ethnicities and nations are equal, in everything and all the time. That is done under social science.</p>
<p>The day will come - if it&rsquo;s not already here - that academia and the politicians will so try to fudge the natural and social sciences, that it will be impossible to tell which is which.</p>

		<p>Because of the internet, I believe it&rsquo;s becoming vastly more difficult for racial apologists to hide the truth.  The majority of Americans use computers, either in their homes, workplaces, schools, or public libraries, and have access to sites and book-buying that didn&rsquo;t exist 20 years ago.  TV news sources are already being forced to address issues and situations they once could have ignored, and information this explosive cannot be left unexamined.</p>

		<p>This is only the beginning of trying to understand something very complex, the genes that gives forth life.  As man delve deeper and deeper into the study of life, he will come to understand and accept that there is a divine hand in his creation and of this universe that he is part of.</p>
<p>As part of the developing knowledge of the human genome, man (the superior genes) will realize that selective breeding of the inferior genes is absolutely needed.  Presently, inferior genes are producing mindlessly and depending on the superior genes for handouts in order to survive.</p>

		<p>The real concern is not the &#8220;morally perplexing&#8221;, but the the &#8220;politically awkward&#8221;.  After all, how morally perplexing is it for a normal, healthy person to prefer their own blood, and take action to benefit their own kind?  <br>
     But the political fallout could be enormous.  The modern, liberal State has made racial equality the cornerstone of every social policy.  What will they do when everyone with a brain openly acknowledges that the races not only exist, but are far from equal?  What institutions, public or private, have not loudly embraced &#8220;diversity&#8221;, and forced all their employees to keep their mouths shut?  The West has gone through a madness as bizarre as China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution of 40 years ago, and our leaders cannot justify it or show that it has benefitted us in any way.  We have been right and they have been wrong, and that scares them.  </p>

<p>Especially with regard to China and India, and again especially with regard to China, there will be no moral constraints AT ALL to doing what ever genetic testing and manipulation and science is conceived. There will be absolutely no political squeamishness on the part of the Chinese. They are probably already now doing eugenics on a massive scale in a way not even possible to be contemplated in the U.S.</p>

		<p>Well,anybody who&rsquo;s read Rushton isn&rsquo;t going to be exactly surprised about this.  It always amazes me to see how very hard the libs beat their heads against the wall to maintain the lie that race makes no difference.  What nonsense!  I mean, a cretin could look around, see who predominates on the basketball courts, who&rsquo;s the majority in the classical music classes, and who&rsquo;s in the majority in scientific and mathematical Ph.D. classes!  While there are always exceptions, the vast majority hold true to their racial lineage.  In India, they divided people by classes:  those who serve others, those who buy and sell, those who are gifted scientifically and in the arts, and those who are &#8220;twice-born&#8221; - destined to be monks, yogis and saints.  These were the 4 main castes, and originally were not genetic, but were assigned when the person was old enough to have his/her traits analyzed.  People generally fall into one of these classes just naturally, all around the world.  So while race IS a factor, there is also the factor of natural caste, which of course is taboo in Western countries.  That&rsquo;s unfortunate, because it could be useful in helping promote a more peaceful society.</p>

<p>Ah, but it makes a very big difference to bureaucratic<br>
institutions.  </p>
<p>Currently, there is a presumption that unequal<br>
outcomes are the result of discrimination  <br>
in courts, political discourse, etc.  All that<br>
the supposedly aggrieved party need do is make<br>
a pro forma argument.</p>
<p>And we all know the results of that.</p>
<p>It will be become harder for courts to make that<br>
presumption as the evidence piles up.</p>
<p>And although its possible to have systematic<br>
duplicity in science, it is generally <br>
much harder to lie in science <br>
than in politics.  Global warming is actually<br>
a good example.  The IPCC accepted the obviously<br>
crooked analysis of the CRU because it is a <br>
political organization, not a scientific one.</p>
<p>The more reputable scientific organizations<br>
(NAS) have remained much more skeptical<br>
despite political pressure.</p>

		<p>#8 you are so right.  Do these studies really reveal anything about racial differences that are not easily observable to those who live in reality?  What if these studies suddenly told us that Asians (Orientals) have the highest proclivity towards crime and street violence, and that blacks have the highest innate intelligence.  Nobody would believe it.  Instead one would simply assume it is a misprint or another phony study. We know what we see in every city on every news station.</p>

		<p>Could 2010 mark the begining of the end for the &#8220;race is a meaningless social construct&#8221; ideologues who now enjoy a near stranglehold over the media, mainstream politics and science? Perhaps, perhaps not. Some here seem to believe that the blank-slate leftists will try and supress anything that contradicts their dogmas about human equality with the same fervor of a medieval religious fundamentalist. That might happen, but given the widespread avaliablity of &#8216;alternative&rsquo; media sources like the internet I think it would be extremely difficult. The radical egalitarians (leftists that believe every human behavioral trait except sexual orientation is not genetically influenced) need to be exposed for the hypocritical frauds that they are. I would find it most thrilling if these ignoramuses are forced to confront the truth about genetic differnces head on, and justly receive the long overdue ridicule and scorn they  deserve for having promoted politically infused pseudo-science on the unsuspecting public. </p>

If anyone hopes that progress in Genetic Science will lead to more enlightened government policy, then those people are hoping in vain.

<p>&gt; If you lived in a country where they are now loosing land to higher sea levels, your politics would be decided.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more reputable scientific organizations<br>
(NAS) have remained much more skeptical<br>
despite political pressure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; More reputable, why?  Because it suits your favorite political outcomes?  The first and most blantant offenders of manipulating science were the &#8220;scientists&#8221; who worked for corporations with interests in keeping things just the way they are - because they still have lots of money to make.</p>

		<p>6-The Conservative: I followed your link.  These people aren&rsquo;t worried that &#8220;racist&#8221; Whites will begin to argue that discrimination is scientifically justified.  After all, most of them practice racial discrimination in their own private and professional lives.  They are worried that Whites will demand to know why the country was destroyed, and take action against those who destroyed it.  </p>

		<p>Political controversies aside, I think this is highly interesting research just from the scientific side of it. I hope some of the results will be presented to us in a manner understandable by the intelligent layman.</p>

		<p>8 Anon and 22 Anon: You&rsquo;re right.  Nobody would believe it if Science said that Blacks are smart and Orientals lawless.  This data only confirms what honest, thinking people have long known, and what psychologists have been documenting for decades.  The &#8220;crisis&#8221; is that now biologists, hard scientists with test tubes and computers, who cannot be so easily dismissed, marginalized, demonized, and fired, are saying the same things as we do.  The scientists will try to avoid making the same conclusions as we do, but their racial premises are the same as ours.  On surveying the damage caused by the racial egalitarians, and as they lose their fear of the &#8220;racist&#8221; label, they will come to support policies that will gladden the hearts of eugenicists everywhere.  </p>

<p>The obvious question after having learned that &#8220;global warming&#8221; data was fake, and the peer review process was obliterated, is this:  Certain people wanted to believe the lie, to propagate the lie, and to have as many people as possible accept the lie as truth   &mdash;   for there to be that much quasi-religious pressure means that there is some powerful force that benefits from people believing in the theory/lie of man-made global warming.  What is this force?</p>
<p>Whenever I see or hear about or encounter a movement that wants the average American or European or other white person to make do with a lower standard of living, I assume that there are big corporations behind it.  Big corporations don&rsquo;t like paying people salaries and wages to have a comfortable standard of living, so they&rsquo;re financing/funding/commissioning faked up MMGW data, to sucker people into doing with less and therefore not working as much.</p>
<p>Now that MMGW has been exposed as a hoax, what are big corporations going to do to force us to live like peons?  Answer:  Open borders and amnesty.  Look for the establishment to push the immigration issue over the next year, and push it hard.  Like, all four barrels.  The propaganda and pressure is going to get unbearable.</p>

I always thought that the beauty of natural science was that it contained universal truths, which could not be overriden.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not true at all. Science does not know whether it has reached any universal truths because it can&rsquo;t prove anything. The accumulation of specific examples is not sufficient to prove a general proposition. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The few who really understand the genetics will gain a more enlightened, live-and-let-live recognition of the biodiversity within our extraordinary species &mdash; including a clearer view of likely comparative advantages between the world&rsquo;s different economies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course this is the lesson The Economist would like you to take away from this article, yet I agree: &#8220;live-and-let-live&#8221; by allowing different populations to live seperately from one another in each populations&rsquo; own natural/cultural home-range within a homogeneous ethno-nation (state or territoy), so we can all optimally co-exist on this planet of ours.</p>
