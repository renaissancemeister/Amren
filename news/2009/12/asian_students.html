<h1>Asian Students Under Attack at S. Phila. High</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dafney Tales, Philadelphia Daily News, December  4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Zhihua Tian traveled thousands of miles from his native China earlier this year to profit from the treasures of the American education system.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he landed at South Philadelphia High School, where the number of violent incidents often overshadow student achievements.</p>
<p>Tian, 19, of South Philly, and five other students who are recent immigrants are staying home today because they were among 26 Asian students who were attacked by a gang of other students throughout the day yesterday, said Xu Lin, of the Chinatown Development Corporation, who works with victimized students.</p>
<p>District officials said that 10 students have been suspended. {snip}</p>
<p>Several incidents of violence against Asian immigrants were reported at the school last year.</p>
<p>Lin said there was a pervasive atmosphere of fear among Asian students.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very, very scary,&#8221; he said, noting that he repeatedly was beaten up when he attended South Philly High. &#8220;You go to school and you don&rsquo;t know when you&rsquo;ll be attacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 12:30 p.m., Tian and two friends were heading to the cafeteria when someone ran up and hit him in the head from behind, Tian said through Lin, who translated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His friend Shan Chen, 18, also a freshman, was pushed to the ground, punched and kicked, Chen said.</p>
<p>Seven of the victims, including Tian, were treated at Methodist Hospital for scrapes and bruises.</p>
<p>Violent incidents against Asian students often go unreported because the victims often have a language barrier or choose to suffer in silence rather than risk retaliation, said Tram Nguyen, a community organizer with Victim Services in South Philly.</p>
<p>But students at the school, which is 18 percent Asian and has been designated by the state as &#8220;persistently dangerous&#8221; the last three years, have tried to stop the violence against them.</p>

		<p>Poor Tian. He paid for the same &#8220;education&#8221; I got for free working at a downtown steakhouse. I &#8220;graduated&#8221; when I realized that working there wasn`t worth the $185.00 a week. </p>

		<p>No, violence often goes unreported because victims know those in charge will do nothing if the attackers are black.</p>
<p>Look at the demographics:<br>
The school is 65% black and only 10% white<br>
That means it will be persistently dangerous and violence will be persistently overlooked or tolerated.</p>

		<p>Man, this kid has bad luck. All you want is a free education and a good experience in America and you end up in Philly. Maybe he will go back to China and tell his fellow Chinamen that America is not worth taking over because of the violent nature of blacks. That is my theory why the Japanese did not take us over in the 80&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>As a Philadelphia native I would bring to your attention the fact that the two major newspapers in the city have not identified the attackers as africian americams.There have been unprovoked attacks on whites as well for years but of course the msm is more concerned with minorities.The number of white students in the public schools in the city is limited and therefore the white students are vulnerable.The vicious attacks usually go unreported.</p>

		<p>So will the Blacks be punished for hate crimes against Asians? Nope. The Asian youth learn the wonders of diversity. In the small 95% White city that I grew up in I went to school with a small number of students from Korea, India, and Taiwan. Two were in my homeroom during high school. They were never accosted by their predominantly White classmates. Maybe if I could talk with them 20 years later they would tell me they felt excluded or slighted, but if they told me they were beaten by mobs, or even challenged to a fist fight, they would be lying. I hope they know they were lucky to not attend high school in urban Philadelphia.</p>

		<p>This topic is covered on Drudge Report today, but the article they posted doesn&rsquo;t give any hint about the race of the perpetrators. That is quite bizarre given that &#8220;racial tension&#8221; is in the headline they present. I guess people of no particular race are attacking Asians in south Philadelphia.</p>

		<p>This is the richest joke of a story I have seen yet. It must only be important as it is happening to Asians. Philly has the distinction of the same beating problem inflicted on the children of African immigrants. Their crime? &#8220;Acting White&#8221; ie doing their school work. As I can personally attest this culture of fighting was the norm in the 70s in the Phila school system. When I was suspended for defending myself my father was told that I&rsquo;d better leave my attitude at the door. My father did not do real well with this. Out to my uncles farm I went. My love of diversity went with me. The Army sharpened my love of diversity and my return home reinforced it. Thank God for culture. Word out dog!</p>

		<p>The T.V. station that reported on this are saying the Asians were beaten by blacks and whites, which sounds too incredible to be true, unless one black wannabe who is white joined in the mob attacks, giving the politically correct media a chance to declare that more than blacks were involved.  Whites themselves have been attacked by blacks at this same school.</p>
<p>Blacks attack everybody.  They don&rsquo;t really belong in a first world society.  I&rsquo;m guessing the attacks on Asians were for the same reason blacks attack whites and that is because they&rsquo;re jealous of them for outperforming them in every single level of anything that has to do with the intellect.</p>
<p>The answer to taking the first step to stop this sort of thing, of course, is to vociferously demand that blacks be held accountable for their actions and advertise the numerous black on everybody else attacks that occur so frequently around the country.</p>
<p>That won&rsquo;t happen so the problem will get worse, just as it has been doing now for years.</p>
<p>The good thing about violence like this is that other races besides whites know first hand how evil blacks really are, and it serves to isolate blacks as troublemakers.</p>
<p>Events like this occur throughout the country with blacks pouncing on all races.  The black/Hispanic wars in California are in full swing right now.  In view of all these incidents I&rsquo;m really amused  whenever some dense black appears on T.V. talking about &#8220;people of color&#8221; as if any other race would EVER want to be considered in the same breath as blacks.</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity, regarding: </p>
<p>&ldquo;BTW, how is a 18-year old a high school freshman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honestly, I burst into uncontrollable laughter over that for about 4 or 5 minuets; it certainly is odd that a &ldquo;superior&rdquo; Asian (Chinese by the look of the name, if I am not mistaken) would be a high school freshman at that age. Perhaps, it is Comrade &ldquo;John Liu&ldquo; that got the beating; if that is the case, it would be more than understandable!</p>
<p>All the best QD and have a great weekend,</p>

		<p>One telling statistical grouping about Southern High deals with classes offered for those who are not considered average.</p>
<p>There are 210 kids in Special Education.</p>
<p>There are 8 (no typo: that&rsquo;s eight) pupils in gifted education.</p>
<p>The school has 26 TIMES more kids in SpEd than in honors.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll bet you that 3 of those 8 are only in there because of education&rsquo;s version of affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Things have been like this for decades. When I was in High School in Los Angeles in the 1970&rsquo;s at a predominantly black school, the whites and asians would be attacked. It was never a &#8216;racial issue&rsquo; when a &#8216;honkey&rsquo; was swarmed by blacks. But when an asian youngster was attacked by blacks, school officials were all over it, trying to fix the &#8216;race problem&rsquo; and doing stupid things to &#8216;foster understanding&rsquo;. It didn&rsquo;t matter. The blacks kept acting like pack criminals, the whites were always under attack and the school officials didn&rsquo;t care, and the Korean kids would be attacked by blacks and officials would do all kinds of silly garbage to patch things up. The Koreans weren&rsquo;t fooled a bit, they just went on referring to the blacks as animals. </p>

		<p>The mainstream press reports try to make it look like blacks and whites were equally likely to mistreat the Asian students. They also said they were victims of &#8220;gang violence&#8221; which 99% of the time means Black or Hispanic violence. No surprise here. Blacks hate any race that does better than they do, which is to say everyone who isn&rsquo;t Black. They especially hate Koreans who move into the same filthy slums where they live and within a generation are moving out, while the Blacks are there forever. Asians, Koreans especially, are a reminder that this isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;white man&rsquo;s world,&#8221; its just a world where more intelligent hardworking people&rsquo;s can succeed. </p>

		<p>Most Asians coming to a first world nation like the U.S.A do not expect such behaviour. Black racism against non-blacks is not new. <br>
http://www.tabunka.org/newsletter/black_racism.html</p>
<p>Kimora Lee Simons for example who is half Korean and half black was called &#8220;chinky giraffe&#8221;, by her black classmates because of her height and Asian ancestry. By the time she was 10 years old, she was 5-foot 8-inches tall, and became the target of schoolyard taunts and teasing. With no Asian population in her community, she had difficulty fitting in with the mostly black student body who shunned her because of her Asian ancestry.</p>
<p>These students remind me of those East Asian tourists who come to London and have shocked expression in their faces when they see third world London full of brown and black masses. They expect something out of Mary Poppins but all they find a third world city with beautiful old buildings. <br>

<p>Philly school&rsquo;s racial tensions lead to fights<br>
PHILADELPHIA  &mdash;  Tensions between black and Asian students at a public high school erupted in a series of assaults over two days, leading to 10 suspensions and several students seeking medical treatment. Ten students  &mdash;  all black or Asian  &mdash;  were given 10-day suspensions after that attack and may be permanently expelled, district spokesman Vincent Thompson said</p>

		<p>Lin said there was a pervasive atmosphere of fear among Asian students.<br>
&hellip;the school, which is 18 percent Asian has been designated by the state as &ldquo;persistently dangerous&rdquo; <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deplorable that students, of whatever race, should have to live in fear like this.  And of course, we are left to assume, by default,  that those unidentified racist attackers of Asians are whites.  Naturally, what else?  Aren&rsquo;t whites ALWAYS the aggressors, according to the media?   &mdash;   if not by statement, then by  implication.  Since half a truth is as bad as a lie,  this is dishonest, deceptive journalism!  Or inept, to say the very least.</p>
<p>But when you look closer at the situation, whites constitute  merely a tenth of the school population, about half that of the Asians;  so it&rsquo;s hardly likely that such a tiny minority would be attacking another minority which is actually twice their size.  No, not likely at all. So what&rsquo;s the rest of the story that the newspaper is not telling us?   And WHY not?  What is the truth they do wish to have known?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there&rsquo;s a pattern of abuse against an Asian minority which is only about one-fifth,  then what must it be against the white students who are merely half of that?   Are we to assume there is no bullying of whites? &hellip; that they are instead the attackers, as it&rsquo;s left to appear?   But if the very small minority of whites are indeed abused, why is there no mention of it?  Why only Asians? Are only non-white minorities deserving of concern?  Or are whites, even when just 1/10th, not considered a &#8220;minority&#8221;?  I suppose the &#8220;majority&#8221;  [such a nonsense term!] even when it&rsquo;s only a tenth(!!!), is presumed to be able to take care of itself. </p>
<p>What kind of &#8220;responsible&#8221; journalism is it that describes a problem, yet fails (no, deliberately neglects!) to mention the source or cause of the problem, as if that&rsquo;s irrelevant?  Worse still is their sin of omission   &mdash;    leaving, by silent implication, another group to be considered responsible.  </p>
<p>And lastly, let me say how much I hate these idiotic, misleading terms of &#8220;majority&#8221;/ &#8220;minority&#8221; that were conceived by Marxists like  Gunnar Myrdal who were going to &#8216;fix&rsquo; our race problem!  Why should we continue being slavishly bound to their deceptive terminology which only distorts facts and reality to suit their purpose at our expense? <br>

		<p>&#8220;Have tried to stop the violence.&#8221; Have tried, have tried, have tried, have tried. Ahhhh, baloney. These attacks are the attack of the bully. That is what the black in this country are. NOT a poor disadvantaged down trodden &#8220;minority&#8221;. Just a plain old ordinary bad bully. The black ENJOYS their status as the bully. There is such a malicious pleasure they derive from their behavior. A perverse and depraved mentality through and through without any redeeming value. A very widespread mental sickness that enjoys just very bad evil behavior.</p>

<p>But they don&rsquo;t just fight with non-blacks, they constantly fight with each other. I recall a story posted here some years ago about Philly blacks attacking African blacks who had moved into their neighborhoods. After hurricane Katrina there were melees at highschools in Texas between New Orleans blacks and local blacks. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just very quarrlesome by nature.<br>

		<p>In California, predominately African American areas were previously served by the large-chain grocery stores.  However most of these big stores left due to constant shoplifting, robberies, riots, etc.  They were replaced by small corner grocery stores.  These stores are essential for inner-city neighborhoods, because otherwise, African-Americans would have to travel miles to get to buy food. <br>
 <br>
However, over the past 40 years, I have observed numerous successive ethnic groups attempt to run these small stores.  Whites, Jews, Lebonese, Arabs, Chinese, Pakistanis, and Koreans.  In each case, the same thing happened.  Excessive shoplifting, aggression, grafitti, robbery, and sometimes murder, has driven these small shopkeepers out.  During the periodic riots, such stores are the first to be plundered and burned.  Then, the African-Americans have the gall to complain about the &#8220;lack of services&#8221; in their communities.  There are NO races that can get along with Africans.  </p>

		<p>I have a very intellegent Iranian friend, whose family immigrated to the USA when he was a child.  When he was young, he was taught (by the media) that Whites are evil racists and that Africans are noble, good, oppressed people.  However, after transferring into a predominately Black school, he was constantly attacked and abused by Blacks, and he experienced first hand, Black &#8220;culture.&#8221;  He is so angry and resentful, that he now runs a blog devoted to praising the cultural qualities of Europeans.  Go to:   <a href="http://iranianforaryans.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://iranianforaryans.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>I occasionally meet Indians, Chinese, Arabs, Thi, etc. who think that Americans are crazy for continuing to put up with sociopathic behavior by Africans and continuing to import hundreds of thousands of them.  A Chinese friend told me that, &#8220;rioting&#8221; by Africans simply would never be allowed in China.  Such people would be rounded up and would simply disappear.  Unlike Europeans, the Chinese have a very, very low opinion of Africans.  </p>

		<p>The 18 year old &#8220;freshmen&#8221; (lol) must have had to give their true ages to the police or were so rattled they told the truth. When I was in HS, we noticed some students from Taiwan seemed a bit old. Turned out they were in their 20&rsquo;s (and lying about their age and background to school officials), and were simply going through HS in the US to get good grades and admittance to US colleges without having to pay - a couple of them had already been through college &#8220;back home&#8221;. HS was basically a &#8220;repeat&#8221;. I can remember this occurring with not only Chinese students but Vietnamese as well. Carter opened the gates for them, and more than a few guys of small stature in their 20&rsquo;s simply claimed to be teens and went to HS and off to college for free. There is a myth that Asians don&rsquo;t receive money, grants, favoritism from Uncle Sam, but that isn&rsquo;t true at all. It isn&rsquo;t only schooling, it&rsquo;s in regard to other things, like SBA loans, housing loans in cities like Los Angeles etc. </p>
<p>All this said, the fact is that no one should be getting attacked, but blacks are blacks. And our media is anti-white, as the black attacks on whites go basically unreported, but attacks by blacks on other non-whites are a cause of concern to &#8220;the community&#8221;. After all, the idiot marxists still believe they can get all the non-whites to join hands and get rid of whitey. Then the non-whites can go back to fighting with each other while the marxists enjoy unfettered rule. Fat chance. It&rsquo;ll all fall apart. </p>

From the AP article Jimmy Paul (#17) posted:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The school, with some 1,200 students, is 70 percent black and 18 percent Asian..&#8221;</p>
<p>No mention of White students so I wonder if the remaining 12% are hispanic and not White (or in this case, hispanics labeled as Whites by school administrators and the msm  &mdash;  it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time that hispanic criminals were categorized as White). </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the difference between Asian and White students (if there are any) at ANY given school:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;We are outraged,&rsquo; said Xu Lin of the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corp.</p>
<p>and:</p>
<p>Wei Chen, president of the school&rsquo;s Chinese-American Student Association, said the attacks stem from bullying over cultural differences&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there a White-American Student Association?  Or a Philadelphia European-American Development Corp.?</p>
<p>Seems the Asians in Philadelphia can turn to their race-based advocates and race-based advocacy groups to defend them, just as they do in California, and as every other ethnic/racial group is allowed.</p>
<p>This needs to be pointed out repeatedly, asked repeatedly  &mdash;  and we need to demand answers of government officials.  Why is every group allowed to form advocacy groups except Whites and why is it every time Whites even deign to try to organize themselves we are called White Supremacists or Nazis and immediately labeled as a Hate Group by the ADL, $PLC and ACLU?i</p>
<p>We must break the power these groups have over us, give up some of our prized individuality and organize along racial lines to protect ourselves and our interests against those who seek our destruction and continue to attack us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;There is a myth that Asians don&rsquo;t receive money, grants, favoritism from Uncle Sam, but that isn&rsquo;t true&#8221;</p>
<p>You are absolutely correct.  At the universities that I worked at, starting around 1970, Asians were given special treatment, including special &#8220;Minority-targeted&#8221; financial aid, affirmative action admittance into college, etc.  This was in spite of the fact that many of these Asians were not USA citizens, and many, in fact, came from very wealthy Hong Kong, San Francisco, or Canadian families (much more wealthy than the White students they were replacing.).  In those days, money was being thrown toward universities for &#8220;Minority Programs,&#8221; and since universities could not find Blacks and Hispanics who could meet the most rudimentary academic levels, universities were falling overthmeselves for Asian students, who were smart enough to actually complete the curriculum.  In California, accepting Asians into &#8220;minority&#8221; programs continued even after Asians became 30 to 40% of some student bodies.  </p>
<p> I saw smart, motivated White kids having to work 20 hrs a week to earn money (and therefore suffer academically and take extra time to graduate), being passed over for rich Asian, non-citizen students, who got a free ride with no outside employment.  In some cases, all fees, tuition, and dorm costs were paid or waived for Asian kids, who&rsquo;s rich parents would fly them to Italy for Christmas!  </p>
<p>This was the turning point for me.  This was the wake-up call that made me realize that something was wrong with the system.  Today, these Government programs disallow such financial aid to non-citizens and to Asians (money now is directed primarily to Blacks, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, and American Indians). However, I occasionally see an Iranian, East Indian, or Kurd in such program. </p>

		<p>A smart Nigerian fellow I know came to the USA for Graduate School, followed by USA citizenship.  Having watched TV in Nigeria, he believed that Whites were racist and dangerous, and that he would find commonality and friendship among African-Americans.  Boy was he surprised.  It only took him about 6 months to move as far from American Blacks as he could and into a White neighborhood.  He told me that he had nothing in common with USA Blacks and in fact more in common with Whites (he was reasonably cultured and intelligent).  He believed that African-Americans were their own worst enemies.  He would not marry an American Black, and instead returned to Nigeria for a wife.  He claims to keep his children away from American Blacks.  Good luck! </p>

Some obviously think we do!  Why?  Because (in the minds of various powerful groups) we need it in order to:</p>
<p>   &mdash;   achieve diversity&hellip;an imprecise, undefined goal: (At what point is sufficient diversity attained? Where do we stop?  We&rsquo;ve never been told.)<br>
   &mdash;   to dilute the founding stock and culture and change the racial mix<br>
   &mdash;   to gain more souls<br>
   &mdash;   to gain  more voters<br>
   &mdash;   to gain more cheap labor (and simultaneously keep American wages down)<br>
   &mdash;   to gain more consumers/producers for the ravenous merchandising industries<br>
   &mdash;   to  gain divine favor, display one&rsquo;s compassion, and feel virtuous about oneself.</p>

So, he was set back.  Or, it could also be that he was denied education in China for various political reasons.</p>
<p>Besides, 18 and a freshman or not, I commend the student for perseverance rather than just dropping out and latching onto a government check.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;How does Tian manage in schoold if he does not speak English? Are the taxpayers paying for a translator?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Schools offer a multitude of bi-lingual classes that YOU the taxpayer pay for.  It has been my experience that art, music, physical education, sports, AP and honors programs are gutted or eliminated to preserve funding for bi-lingual, multi-culti or race-specific programs   &mdash;  and that includes busing as well.  Of course, those who promote this for your children hold themselves and their precious children apart.</p>
<p>And yes, you also pay for a multitude of translators  &mdash;  not just in the schools but in the courts, hospitals and any other government entity you can think of  &mdash;  most private enterprises these days too. Any way you look at it whether as a consumer or a taxpayer, you are paying for translators for the NWO Tower of &#8216;Babble&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In California, ground zero of babble central, taxpayers are forced to accommodate the latest obscure language speakers from Mexico:  Nahuatl, Maya, Mixtec, <br>
Zapotec  &mdash;  whose low IQd, destitute speakers are pouring into destitute California demanding services.  Seems some of California&rsquo;s new immigrants don&rsquo;t like or understand the Laws of the US and prefer the old ways of their own cultures, &#8220;which we must respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember this case?  How much do you think it cost the taxpayers of California to pay for the translators?</p>
<p>The father is accused of asking for $20,000, 100 cases of Corona beer, 50 cases of Modelo beer, several cases of meat, two cases of wine, 50 cases of Gatorade and 50 cases of soft drinks in a cardboard box in an attempt to arrange a marriage between his 14-year-old daughter to his 18-year-old neighbor&hellip;.Martinez &mdash; who speaks only Triqui, the indigenous language of Oaxaca&hellip; two interpreters translated from English to Spanish to Triqui&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/ykmgmyg</p>
<p>And from Anon # 32:</p>
<p>&#8221;..Why does the USA need any more immigration? We have much employment and north of 300 million people here already&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting, isn&rsquo;t it, when unemployment &#8216;officially&rsquo; is at 10% (unofficially at 17-20%) and states such as California are dead broke, 125,000 new, non-White, mostly dirt poor immigrants continue to flood into White US homelands.</p>
<p>VDare reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Unemployment had reached 10.2% at last report in early November, its highest level for some 26 years. ..Incredibly, despite the recession, about 125,000 legal immigrants a month   &mdash;  1.5 million a year  &mdash;   are still entering the U.S&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/ybbkoal</p>
<p>Could this be because of the government&rsquo;s plan to destroy the US economy and displace the NATIVE BORN WHITE POPULATION as Jupiter often reminds us?</p>
<p>Is this the &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; idiot obama voters counted on?</p>

		<p>To liberals the Asians cannot claim racial discrimination because they are not brutalized as much as blacks brutalize each other.  Only if black on asian assaults rise the the truly hideous levels of black on black assaults will a liberal admit that there might be some discrimination.  Or in a specific case if the black uses a vile anti-Asian epithet,such as &#8220;chink&#8221; or &#8220;chinky&#8221; or &#8220;slope&#8221; or the like.</p>
<p>How likely is it that blacks are going to beat, brutalize and slaughter Asians or whites as much as they do each other?  Not very likely.</p>
<p>So you must accept the heightened death, rape and robbery rate that is inevitable whenever you live around black folks.  </p>
<p>Well, unless you are a black person, of course, in which case it is a positive good to help you escape your murderous black brethren and come live with white people.  This is called &#8220;integration&#8221;, and it only lasts a short period until the black folks who were supposedly escaping black violence turn violent themselves (or their Cousin Pookie visiting from East Moron, Alabama does).</p>

<p>In days of yore, South Philadelphia High was a decent public high school.  Perhaps because it was 80% white, the majority of which were Italian Americans.  But South Philly has undergone a huge change in demographics.  Where it was mostly white with some black neighborhoods, now it is home to thousands of Cambodians, Vietnamese and other Asians.</p>
<p>South Philly&rsquo;s renowned Italian Market, a tangled conglomeration of shops and streetside vendors in pushcarts, was a charming throwback to it&rsquo;s European heritage.  Now the influx of Asian and other vendors makes it look more like Saigon than Sicily.</p>

Yes, the use of two nuclear weapons brought them to their knees in August.

		<p>Yes, the left likes to bemoan the use of atomic weapons on Japan, but they&rsquo;re also people who refuse to examine any other issue in proper historical context.</p>
<p>Placing the bombings in context, we see the following:</p>
<p>Japan was almost completely dependant on imported raw materials, raw materials which by 1945 they could no longer obtain.  Much food had to be imported; food rationing had been started well before the war, and bad harvests in Korea left the Koreans eating animal feed-grade grains (treatment which Koreans remember to this day.)  With Japan&rsquo;s merchant fleet on the bottom by 1945, due to the ravages of US submarine attacks and mines laid by US bombers, imports of food from the Asian mainland were effectively cut off.  One of the favorite claims by left-wing historical revisionists is that the US could simply have continued to blockade Japan, while neither invading the place or atom-bombing it, and that this would somehow have been more &#8220;humane&#8221; than what we actually did.  The problem is that the starvation that would have resulted in the winter of 1945-46 would have easily killed more Japanese than the atom bombings did, and much more slowly.  Additionally, it would not have convinced Japan&rsquo;s military junta - who of course remained well-fed throughout the war - to abandon the fight.  The atom bomb was so successful precisely because it seemed unfair; it shocked Japan&rsquo;s military leaders and provided them the excuse to surrender while the terrible but more prolonged suffering they had steadily inflicted on their own people had not.  The whole navy on the seabottom with 400,000 sailors killed?  No problem; we don&rsquo;t need a navy to defend the home islands.  Much of the army ground into hamburger with 1,200,000 soldiers killed?  No problem; we&rsquo;ll train older men, women and kids.  Japan&rsquo;s industry collapsing from conventional bombing and acute shortages of materials?  No problem; we&rsquo;ll give the women and kids bamboo spears.  Atom bombs?  Oh; that&rsquo;s at least a face-saving excuse to surrender.</p>
<p>The problem the left has is that they simply do not understand the operations of a military dictatorship.  These are governments who do not care what privations they inflict on their own people.  Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s Iraq was a fine example; he was executing about 35,000 people a year just to keep the rest in line, and spending exery cent he could on a lavish life for himself and his psychopathic sons in the &#8220;Oil For Palaces Program&#8221; approved by the UN (Uday collected rare sports cars instead of palaces).  The old Argentine military junta used to fly political troublemakers out over the Atlantic and chuck them out of helicopters.  Thousands of people were &#8220;disappeared&#8221; in this fashion.  When Stalin&rsquo;s armies liberated Russian prisoners of war from German POW camps, these men were given a big parade through Moscow.  Afterward, most of them were shot, since they had been inadvertantly been exposed to the West and thus &#8220;contaminated&#8221; (a man captured unwounded was also regarded as a traitor by the Soviet Army).  I&rsquo;ve said it before on this site; the left consists of people who imagine a world in which they would like to live, and then they proceed to pretend that they are actually living there.</p>

		<p>Racism exists in all ethinical groups, some less and some more. But raical violence is another story. My experience is that some White or Asian people may think that they are superior than people of other races, but they usually don&rsquo;t display it by violences or curses against those peoples. They more of times try to show it by superior intelligence or works. Blacks are different. They may not think they are superior (cuz no black civilizaton or intellectual achievement have proved that), but they many times like to resort to the violence to show that they are also strong because they can bully other peoples by being barbaric.</p>
<p>I think the problems of the Blacks root from lacking of their own noble culture and morality. Look at what they can produce in those stupid MVs or RAPs which are all garbages. They got lost.</p>

I think some of &#8216;us&rsquo; need to take a look and ask one&rsquo;s self &hellip;&hellip; why? I&rsquo;ve never been insulted, assaulted, intimidated, disrespected or had to coddle one of them. If there is a group in this country that shares the ideals, work ethic &amp; values with whites - it is the Asians. I really believe the only way our country can revert back to how it once was, will be with cooperation with those that see things the same way we do. I read the &#8216;blotter&rsquo; EVERY day in my city, AND NEVER does an Asian name or photo show up. Guess which 2 races do appear? &hellip;&hellip;. You ALL ARE CORRECT!!!!

		<p>I have long questioned if perhaps some Asians and Whites are more closely related than we usually think?  [(Dons asbestos suit  &mdash;  I am aware what the expected response to this idea is here!)]  In other words, is &#8220;Asian&#8221; too broad a category?  Perhaps that some &#8220;Asians&#8221; really should be considered more &#8220;White&#8221; and others more &#8220;Black&#8221; and others somewhere in-between?</p>
<p>If humanity really did spread &#8220;out of Africa&#8221;, then it is not unreasonable that those populations who encountered the harshest conditions along the way would have been selected for the attributes that we hold as ideal, our ancestors themselves having endured the harsh winters in Europe.  ISTR, (though I do not have the source close at hand) that there were genetic studies that concluded that Whites and East Asians diverged from each other only about 40,000 years ago, while both diverged from Africans more like 100,000 years ago.  While the numbers are approximate and &#8220;divergence&#8221; and &#8220;branching&#8221; somewhat ill-defined in this context, it is enough to question whether the appropriate categorization is Black, White, Asian, etc. or if Intellect/Western, Intellect/Eastern, Brute/Western, Brute/Eastern (possibly an empty group?), etc. would be more reasonable.</p>
<p>On a related note, the source of human skin color was found some years ago  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s more or less an inherited sun tan.  The correlation is almost perfect between skin color and ancestral UV exposure.  The exceptions are explicable from the selective pressures  &mdash;  skin that is too light burns too easily and the individual dies early of skin cancer, while skin that is too dark results in a deficiency of vitamin D and death in childhood.  The exceptions are in situations where some source of vitamin D other than from exposure to sunlight is available (and possibly the environment otherwise so harsh that full-body coverings are almost always worn, as among the peoples of the extreme North, some of the otherwise glaring exceptions to the rule).</p>
<p>I question if the current set of terms we use to describe ethnicity accurately reflect reality.</p>
<p>(Yes, I expect to be flamed as a &#8220;chink-lover&#8221; or somesuch for this.  Please try to hold the flames and make constructive comments, rather than sinking to the same plane as the Marxist multicults.)</p>

		<p>To Fed Up:</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, the &#8220;Fat Man&#8221; and &#8220;Little Boy&#8221; dropped in on Hirohito&rsquo;s tea party, the day  before the Soviet Union was set to invade Japan. Sure, some 280,000-300,000 people were killed as a result. But, I believe that number would have been dwarfed by the number of Japanese who would have been killed under Soviet occupation.</p>
<p>It may be a strange way to think about it, but, in the end the A-bomb saved the Japanese people from Stalin&rsquo;s theatrics. Instead, they were stuck with the Kurile Islands and Sakhalin Island, instead of all of Japan. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;I&rsquo;ve said it before on this site; the left consists of people who imagine a world in which they would like to live, and then they proceed to pretend that they are actually living there&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, the left imagines a world in which they would like to live and then write revisionist textbooks that portray a world that never existed.</p>
<p>I was perusing a new high school text today  &mdash;  the fist entry was a &#8216;selection&rsquo; from junk-science queen Rachel Carson&rsquo;s throughly discredited screed Silent Spring.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/y9eo4we" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/y9eo4we</a></p>
<p>The second entry was about the Iroquois Nation and how their Constitution influenced or perhaps was the basis for the American Constitution.</p>
<p>Do you see what we&rsquo;re up against?</p>
<p>I wish I were making these things up but I&rsquo;m not.</p>

		<p>To Soprano Fan, regarding: </p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a strange way to think about it, but, in the end the A-bomb saved the Japanese people from Stalin&rsquo;s theatrics. Instead, they were stuck with the Kurile Islands and Sakhalin Island, instead of all of Japan.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t a strange way to think about how an alternative ending to World War II might have impacted the earth, not in the least. For starters, had the Soviets invaded and conquered most or even all of Japan, the rapes and murders would have at the very least equaled what happened in Germany. Remember, the Russo-Japanese war still was fresh in their minds and they probably would have fueled that memory in their troops with their typical &ldquo;anti-fascist&rdquo; revenge propaganda. Moreover, they may very well have employed some Chinese and Korean troops in such an occupation of Japan, to &ldquo;redistribute&rdquo; the fun to some peoples they wished to woo to their sociopolitical worldview.</p>
<p>Other possibilities include the USA and USSR both invading Japan, and having their tensions escalate into open hostilities in that country (since the USA had an oddly paternalistic attitude toward that country at the war&rsquo;s end) and in Europe, thus prolonging the war well into the 1946 to 1948 period, or beyond. Also, a Korean War style conflict in the late 40s early 50s might have occurred in that country, if there was a Soviet backed &ldquo;North Japan&rdquo; and an American backed &ldquo;South Japan&rdquo; after the war. </p>
<p>All the best to you Soprano Fan,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Any school, country, nightclub, picnic or subway car that is majority black is persistently dangerous. I ask any Asian person in America, Why do you think Whites abandon these areas? All the PC Hollywood liberals will say it&rsquo;s because of blind racism when in fact it&rsquo;s all about keeping our children safe from savagery.<br>
Don&rsquo;t send your kids to school there! They turn these places into mini Somalias.</p>
