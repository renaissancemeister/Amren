<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{Snip}</p>
<p>It seems the side in favor [of mixed marriage] is arguing from a standpoint of idealism, individualism and airy fairy abstractions, while the other side is defending concrete realities. One of your readers, I thought, had a good point when she said there are six interested parties to a marriage: the bride, the groom, their respective families, their unborn children, and society. I would like to add a seventh constituency, which perhaps is implicit in one of these groups: ancestors.</p>
<p>A recent poll found the vast majority of WWII vets in Britain loathe ZANU Labour Party and what they have done to that once great nation. Many have stated that they would never have fought Hitler had they known that their treasonous Ã©lites would allow the French and Germans to run their lives through the EU, or that hostile, illiterate and in many cases inbred Third World savages would be allowed to invade and colonize their country without the people&rsquo;s consent. Such feelings are widespread in all Western nations that are being inundated with this rabble. While I don&rsquo;t suggest that young people must be beholden to all the whims of their elders or ancestors, I do think the wishes of one&rsquo;s parents, grandparents and forebears should be given consideration. These people did not toil to see the fruits of their labors handed over to alien peoples. This is as relevant to intermarriage as it is to immigration.</p>
<p>A good many things have been said about the individual experiences of people who intermarry, or those who are the products of mixed marriages. Much has also been added here about the societal effects, but as far as I can remember, nobody has yet brought any statistics to bear on the discussion, so I think I will do so. First, I would like to point out that less than 100 years ago, white people accounted for around a third of the world&rsquo;s population. Now we are not much more than 12 percent. In fifty years we could be half that. In a century practically extinct given current demographic projections. In the United States, whites have fallen from 90 percent less than fifty years ago to only 75 percent today, according to official sources. Of course, literate people know the real figure is closer to 65 percent, since the liars in the census department (or their marxist masters in government, take your pick) intentionally inflate the figure by counting as white such sundry groups as Indians, Pakistanis and Arabs.</p>
<p>I think a point being overlooked in all this is immigration. Virtually all other ethnic groups have at least some unchallenged &#8216;Lebensraum&rsquo; to call their own, which to their credit they are guarding fiercely. It is only white nations that are being called upon to invite the world in. When non-white nations like Mexico treat Guatamalan or El Salvadoran migrants like garbage, much worse than the the U.S. treats its wetbacks, they&rsquo;re given a free pass. Not so with Whitey. In an overwhelmingly homogeneous society like the ones we enjoyed not long ago, the odd mixed marriage would not threaten people nearly as much. Such marriages were simply not prevalent enough to alter the demographic makeup of society. But if the founding stock&rsquo;s share of the population plummets due to evil immigration policy then this, concomitant with a rise in mixed marriages, creates a problem. In other words, if you look after the macro (immigration policy), the micro will look after itself. If you don&rsquo;t, these issues will have to be raised one way or another amongst individuals, however uncomfortable it makes some people. We simply don&rsquo;t have the genes to spare.</p>
<p>Speaking of genes, a few people have hinted at a causal relationship between genetics and culture without really getting to the heart of the matter. For those who don&rsquo;t know, intelligence has been conclusively proven to be primarily genetic in origin, the most common estimates being in the range of  70-80 percent. Forget what egalitarians have told you, this is a settled scientific fact, quite unlike the leftist pet topic of global warming. Experts working in the field are in agreement on this, although most of them are too cowardly to acknowledge the fact publicly. Just as variation between individuals is mostly genetic in origin, so is intergroup variation. Smart groups build advanced societies, dim-witted groups do not.</p>
<p>Surely most people reading this are perceptive enough to have noticed that virtually all non-white countries are backwards cesspools. The only other people who have shown themselves capable of building and sustaining first-rate societies are East Asians. All others are mired in various states of backwardness. Not surprisingly, then, the traffic flow is one-way. Marxists are about the only white people who idealize these places, though when they visit, they tend to stay in their air-conditioned compounds far away from the hoi polloi. Deluded fundy Christians are at least willing to spend long periods of time in these exotic locales, they get their hands dirty. I would give them a small measure of credit for this, except for the fact these tend to be the same people who are pushing for massive Third World immigration into our countries.</p>
<p>So what it comes down to is this: non-whites need white people. It&rsquo;s overwhelmingly whites who have made the scientific, medical and other discoveries that have extended life spans and improved living standards in the world over the past 500 years. Looking at the Nobel Prize list or any other objective measure of civilizational attainment, it looks like a white man&rsquo;s (and especially Ashkenazi Jewish) conspiracy. Whites are no less the world leaders in altruism. When there is a natural disaster of any kind, even in a worthless Muslim hellhole, it is White Christian (or formerly Christian) nations who are first on the scene, first in funds donated. The lazy, inbred Saudis and others with their petrodollars don&rsquo;t lift a finger to help their brethren.</p>
<p>One commenter implied that blacks aren&rsquo;t given enough credit for their contributions to the building of America. I don&rsquo;t mean to sound insensitive, but their contributions were very marginal in the area of inspiration. In the area of perspiration I will give them their due, but as I think the late Sam Francis pointed out, you could have replaced them with the Chinese or any other group of laborers and America would have been none the worse off in the long run. Descendants of slaves clearly benefited from the exchange. I&rsquo;m not sure the white majority did, given the social problems and strife the large importation of a foreign people created.</p>
<p>Lastly, aesthetics. White people have many recessive traits that are scarcely found in other groups. In my admittedly biased and ethnocentric opinion, whites are the most physically beautiful race. Non-whites may protest, but their actions indicate many of them share this view. Blondes were prized as concubines in the Ottoman world, just as they are prized in China. Whites dominate the modelling industry. This industry is run by homosexual leftists, so I really don&rsquo;t think they are picking whites for political reasons. Whites just sell, that&rsquo;s all. Even the South American Miss Universe beauties, or blacks who are touted, tend to be light-skinned women with Caucasoid features. In fact, most black men are said to prefer lighter-skinned black women. They get white features and the straight hair while staying true to their people. I can&rsquo;t blame them for that. The irony is that by marrying white women, non-white men in mixed marriages are reducing those recessive white traits in the global population. The sons and grandsons of such men will have less and less opportunities to gaze upon unique white beauty because of their fathers&rsquo; actions. So maybe the solution is for black men who really like white women to find black mates with light skin and Caucasoid facial features. I suspect that the demand far outstrips the supply, though, and we&rsquo;re back to square one. In any case, if we&rsquo;re such an ugly and awful people, the non-white malcontents should surely want to get far away from us. I don&rsquo;t see too many rushing for the exits.</p>
<p>Some people may consider what I&rsquo;ve written above to be harsh, blunt or mean-spirited. In any honest discussion on sensitive issues, that&rsquo;s the risk you take by speaking your mind. But I think it&rsquo;s a natural and justified reaction to half a century of white-bashing. The truth is that whites are being held to a higher standard. A phony conservative would cite George Bush&rsquo;s &#8216;soft bigotry of low expectations&rsquo; because these cretins never miss an opportunity to pander to minorities. In truth, whites are the victims here. We are the only people who are being prevented from sticking to our own kind and freely associating with our kin to the exclusion of others. The point is no less valid just because self-loathing whites instigated this and wish to exterminate their own people. They and the minorities they manipulate are both driven by envy. And we will deal with the white traitors in due course.</p>
<p>For my part I don&rsquo;t need any token minorities like Michael Steele to speak on my behalf. And my race and civilization certainly doesn&rsquo;t need to justify its right to exist to anyone. We WILL survive whether you like it or not. The smart minorities know where their bread is buttered, and are grateful to live in our societies. As someone pointed out, the minorities&rsquo; opinions don&rsquo;t count for squat when it comes to our survival. We refuse to be dispossessed, physically exterminated or absorbed through intermarriage. We won&rsquo;t go away to make failed societies or ethnic groups feel better about themselves.</p>

The best argument against miscegenation is that it destroys the uniqueness of our diversity.</p>
<p>I have two basic arguments.</p>
<p>If someone tells me that God wants all the races to love each other, I remind them that God created unique races. If He wanted one race, He would have created just one. Racial mixing is a slap in the face to Gods divine plan.</p>
<p>The second is the one I stated first. Evolution has created the diversity we see. Mixing races destroys that diversity. If you follow racial interbreeding to it&rsquo;s logical extreme, diversity of people would be eliminated (but I suspect that&rsquo;s what the diversity advocates are really working for, and not the preservation of diversity).</p>

		<p>I like to think in terms of collective benefits. If whites date and marry each other then we all benefit as a group. Our lives are happier, our families are more stable, our friendships are stronger, our communities are safer, and we have more success in school and business. We will be a stronger force to keep our countries from weakening and going in wrong directions. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not about what is right and wrong.  It&rsquo;s about what is allowed and what is not.  Specifically, since people allow other races to live in their communities and allow a centralized authority that doesn&rsquo;t even have the vaguest intention of ever working in their best interest at all, to tell them what to do, then miscegenation and the incredible destruction it does, is ALLOWED.</p>
<p>No argument will convince people not to do it.  Bad people will do bad things because they choose to.  And they will choose not to even notice what they are doing is bad.  And they absolutely will not listen to any argument that, in any way, contradicts their selfish desire (even if it is completely self-destructive).</p>
<p>What will convince them?  Not allowing them to live in the &#8220;good&#8221; neighborhood/community/nation, if they engage in that.</p>
<p>Until we TAKE the right to live separate AND disempower our governments to have any say in the matter, this won&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Your &#8220;arguments&#8221; on the matter mean nothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bad news.  The good news is almost every government in the western world is bankrupt.  No money means no power.  It&rsquo;s soon going to become much safer to simply ignore our governments.</p>
<p>The question is&hellip;.will you?  Will YOU choose to move to areas where people are making this decision.  When a state outlaws miscegenation or simply tells non-whites they can&rsquo;t live there, will YOU move there?</p>
<p>It will probably involve short term sacrifice for long term gain.  It could also lead to war, before the last vestiges of government power dissolve.</p>
<p>What comes next depends very heavily on the choices you make.</p>

		<p>Another reason why our numbers have shrunk so much is because we&rsquo;re so darn good at multitasking.  While we&rsquo;re aborting our white babies or sending our living sons and daughters to die for others in other lands, we&rsquo;re also creating cures for diseases that inflict non-whites, we&rsquo;re also bringing food and water to starving non-whites, and we&rsquo;re also rescuing non-whites from natural disasters.</p>
<p>Why do we sacrifice our own best interests for the benefit of others simply because we want to feel good about ourselves?  Doesn&rsquo;t sound like such intelligent stock to me!!!<br>

		<p>I think I&rsquo;m in love with this lady, whomever she may be.</p>
<p>I found myself reading my own words throughout this piece, particularly the notation that white Europeans and their American descendents have been responsible for virtually all the scientific, medical, technological, agricultural, manufacturing, political, and social progress in history, beginning with the Greeks and Romans (and temporarily interrupted for nearly a millenium), continuing with the Renaissance until the present.  There&rsquo;s no question that East Asia has made stunning strides in the past hundred, and particularly the past fifty years, but their progress has been based mainly on the foundation of white European thought and accomplishment.  It is quite possible that they may surpass us in the future, but they were brought along initially by the enlightenment of white European thought and invention.</p>
<p>What is also unique about the white race is its bizarre propensity for self-loathing, the denial of its accomplishments for the immense benefit of all mankind. Our children are taught that we&rsquo;re the scourge of history, visiting horrors, injustice, exploitation, and brutality upon the less fortunate of the world, practically all of whom, perversely and inexplicably, seem to want to come to our countries and particularly to America. Surely, our credulous children must believe, these idyllically situated peasants must have been seduced by watching American television and fail to appreciate the joy of living in rude dwellings and surviving on a subsistence diet.  They look so healthy, so nice and thin! And all that healthy outdoor living, working long days in the cane fields and rice paddies, who are we to deprive them of their simple existence?</p>
<p>There almost seems to be something genetically suicidal about the white European races. If and when we&rsquo;re finally displaced the world will be a poorer place for it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why, but the effect is the same: race mixing terminates white bloodlines. And we simply cannot allow that to happen.</p>

		<p>Great article.  Whites have been snookered into believing that it is righteous and moral to help others (races) and ignore their own will be our downfall. I blame much of this on the Christian churches. I haven&rsquo;t given a dime to any church for over 25 years because of their false teachings which is destroying the best race on earth. Listening to their mealy-mouth, cowardly drivel about how we are &#8220;all the same&#8221;, God loves everybody, God is all inclusive, etc. etc. turns my stomach.</p>
<p> I read a while back where there are fewer and fewer men in our churches and I believe it is because they have feminized our men and turned them into the metro male to be kind to all, including the enemy, turn the other cheek garbage. With teachings like that how can we expect our men to fight for their women, children and race? Nobody likes a sissy.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m currently in the USA to spend Christmas with my daughter and her family.  Last evening I was speaking to a young American who told me how he was going to marry Tiger Woods&rsquo; wife. When I told him that I wouldn&rsquo;t touch her, that any White woman who would lie with a black man was beyond the pale as far as I was concerned, he looked panicked and said &#8220;Change the subject!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s true, what Holder said; Americans are cowards when it comes to race.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to make a lot of friends on this trip.</p>

		<p>This article was excellent.  For a long time I&rsquo;ve been touting the European &amp; American contributions to the betterment of man over those of any other race. It&rsquo;s undeniable. Those claims of Black contributions to the growth of our society are pethetically few and their importance has been hyperbolized. They also neglect the fact that Blacks who contributed to the world of science, medicine etc. were able to do so because of the opportunity to be educated in a Western Instution. Those few took advantage of what was available unlike their present day descendants who with the aid of their self loathing White Apologists in the schools of education, have directed their efforts toward the degradation and ultimate destruction of American education.</p>
<p>The last twenty plus years of fantasy on the part of Hollywood films and TV series and advertisements has resulted neither in creedence on the part of Whites nor in an Epiphany in Black America. </p>

		<p>It has long been my contention that the reason the out-manned and out-gunned Southerners whipped the hell out of the Yankees in so many battles during what&rsquo;s called The Civil War (The War of Northern Aggression is what we call it) is - Southern whites viewed potential marriages much as they did potential breeding of horses and dogs.  The families would get together, compare bloodlines in family trees, and ONLY if there was nothing objectionable on either side would the marriage be allowed to take place.  In other words, only the best, healthiest, mental illness-free potential mates could marry.  Because of that, they produced superior children - all white, and more intelligent and physically strong than were the offspring of the Northerners.  Offspring of white men and black women were of course considered black, and were of no consequence in society.  But I am convinced that a study could be made that would prove the genetic superiority of the Southernors of that time.  Maybe we need to go back to that practice.</p>

		<p>One thing about Europe and Asia, it has been connected by the great grasslands of Central Asia for thousands of years.  There has been so much contact (racially) and not just from the relatively recent famous Mongol Empire that stretched from Korea to Poland.  The Shung nu, Scythians and many others were traipsing across Europe to China and mingling the seed of both worlds in the days of the ancient Greeks and before.</p>
<p>As one poster pointed out, Europeans are quite mixed in their haplogroups.  I&rsquo;m as white as they come and I&rsquo;ve traced my family tree back over a thousand years on all branches to all the northern and western European countries, and my DNA analysis still came back with Asian markers.</p>
<p>The people in that central asian grassland look like a mix of white and east asian - and some people, even in the same families, look more white or more asian.  Skin tones are the same from Europe to east asia, with slight local variances, and both Europe, east asia and even northern India all built great civilizations.</p>
<p>So for these reasons, I don&rsquo;t feel badly about intermarriage between these more advanced races.  It&rsquo;s already occurred through the eons.  As for today, the kids all wind up smart and such. That&rsquo;s not to say that all Asian genetic groups are equal.  When you start to get into the Phillipines or Cambodia and such their is serious dilution.  I do think that those who marry into the more southern races are dooming their descendants to at least cultural poverty.</p>

		<p>OCCAM, if you&rsquo;re going to trespass on our site at least show some respect.  Both by genetics and by culture, European derived people are distinct as a race. At best you might be able to quibble about a small percentage of people or cultural forms not representing the group. Those outliers aren&rsquo;t important in the aggregate. </p>

		<p>&#8220;In other words, only the best, healthiest, mental illness-free potential mates could marry. Because of that, they produced superior children - all white, and more intelligent and physically strong than were the offspring of the Northerners.&#8221;</p>
<p>I too believe that breeding with your own ethnicity/genetic type will produce healthy, intelligent and attractive children.  Noone ever suggested marrying someone for that reason; I came to that conclusion on my own just by observing the general population.  I also have noticed recently how  mixed celebrities need to either bronze their skin or lighten their hair to be more attractive.  Mixed people are very drab  in color.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just ancestors, one has to think of future generations. I believe that every generation should try to leave behind a country that was a little bit better or at least not worse than the one they lived in. What Whites the world over today are doing is handing their countries over to aliens. At the rate we&rsquo;re going, there will not be a single majority White nation in 100 years, with a few eastern european countries maybe being the exception. What will it be like for these future generations? It&rsquo;s selfish for Whites today to blindly stick to an ideology that will harm future generations, very selfish.</p>

		<p>We are all no doubt a mixture of various genetic contributors stretching back centuries and millennia. However, the races that we distinguish as unique today are genetically whole, shall we say, and constitute a distinct group. To make the argument that since we are all &#8220;mixies&#8221; we should keep right on mixing is clearly then misguided.</p>
<p>Not many will accept this, but we &ldquo;lost&rdquo; the right as whites to defend ourselves in the ruins of Berlin in 1945. Hitler and the Nazis we the most extreme pro-white group the world has ever seen. You might call them the original race realists. The white version of OGs. Miscegenation was illegal in Nazi Germany and severely punished. Preservation of national identity and racial purity was job one for the government - by any means necessary. The rest is history.</p>
<p>There are other factors, but the reaction to the horrors of that period launched multiculturalism as the hallmark of civilization and opened the immigration gates to the non-whites in Europe and America. Suddenly, we were all equal, the white physicist and the Indian ratcatcher included. That became the new religion. Since then &#8220;white pride&#8221; and any demonstration thereof has become heretical to that religion and immediately casts one into the Hitler camp. It is a shot fired across the bow when we express heretical thoughts. Most of us then scurry for cover like uncovered rats.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m quite at home in that camp. They could have toned things down a bit back then, but, then again, they were Germans and they don&rsquo;t do anything half way. But I wasn&rsquo;t there and didn&rsquo;t do any of it. I am thus guilty of nothing. But, yes,, miscegenation should be proscribed by law, all non-white immigration should cease immediately, the borders should be secure (it would have taken Hitler 10 minutes tops to close the Mexican border), and the citizens of the nation should come first in all things, and, the identity of the nation should be defended and preserved by, well, nearly any means necessary. Whites have a right to their own Lebensraum. Period. Let the others live in their own and do what they want there. If that makes me a Nazi, I have only one question: Where can I order my uniform?<br>

You seem to believe that since nobody is certain to be 100% white, therefore &#8220;white&#8221; does not exist.  If I have some chocolate ice cream and some vanilla ice cream and I enjoy the flavor of each one - would it be reasonable for me to mix the two together since the &#8220;chocolate&#8221; has a tiny bit of strawberry mixed in and the vanilla has a minuscule amount of banana mixed in?  Of course not.  For all practical purposes, each flavor still maintains its own appeal to me.  You, on the other hand, would require laboratory testing to verify that no strawberry molecules are mixed in with the chocolate.  Otherwise, you&rsquo;d just say &#8220;the heck with it!&#8221; and throw them all in the blender.</p>
<p>On another note, you must also deny the existence of blacks and so I&rsquo;m wondering if you spend time on Afro-centric websites telling them &#8220;black&#8221; does not really exist.  If so, I&rsquo;d be very interested to see the links and read what you&rsquo;ve told them.</p>

<p>Interesting and informative post.  I&rsquo;ve never believed there was any racial harm by mixing of those races displaying similar levels of intelligence, such as Caucasions and East Asians. And offspring of such unions are often physically very handsome, creative, and accomplished.</p>
<p>Perhaps tragically, there is really only one major racial group which is truly well outside the mainstream in terms of human intelligence and creativity, and that is the black African race.  Even among this group, there are substantial differences in IQ, social development, and creativity.</p>
<p>They represent the one truly intractable racial problem in the world, especially to those nations, particularly the US and Brazil, who have very substantial populations of them.</p>

In the upside down world that we live in nothing is considered more vile than &#8220;racism,&#8221; neither famine nor flood can compare to its sheer awfulness.

		<p>Anonymous #20:  Yes, the North won - because of their vastly superior supply of arms, men, and everything else.  It took them most of the war to find a general who would fight, and they finally came up with a drunken bravado-filled leader - Grant.  I don&rsquo;t argue that.  But I do suggest that the only reason the South was able to do as well as it did for as long as it did was because they flatly bred superior men - deliberately and with much forethought.  Plus, Southernors were defending their homeland; men tend to fight a lot harder when what&rsquo;s at stake is their land, their people, and their customs.  The thing is, the Yankees should have won that war in a year.  They did not - and I believe it&rsquo;s because the Southern men had been bred to be superior.  It&rsquo;s a simple matter of genetics.</p>

<p>Yes, importing an alien, unassimilable race was an indescribably colossal error that we&rsquo;ll never recover from, and I deeply regret that the miniscule percentage of Southerners, the Gentry, were very short-sighted and self-centered, but I know that they could never possibly have dreamed of today&rsquo;s situation or that of the past forty years. It was inconceivable then that the White race would devolve into eunuchs and allow the descendants of slaves to have free run of our cities, streets, neighborhoods, schools, etc. </p>
<p>My point: The north, and old Abe, emancipated them on U.S. soil when they should have thought long and hard about how to repatriate them instead. The South&rsquo;s collapse was actually the worst thing to happen to the United States of America as it was the South that had them in control. The north simple-mindedly and unreflectively removed that control. </p>
<p>We now have a disintegrating society. Had the north only stood with the South on this issue rather than ignorantly fighting against them, we would have the nation that our forefathers intended it be upon its creation. </p>

<p>Another factor was that Southern troops were more skilled in the use of firearms, given their long history of hunting for food, and using weapons for self-defense against North American aborigines and criminals. In fact, the lack of firearms knowledge among their Yankee recruits so shocked Union officers, that, after the war, a group of ex-Union generals formed the National Rifle Association on November 17, 1871 to promote better marksmanship among other things.

<p>&gt; This smacks of blind feminist sentiment.  I don&rsquo;t know about the statistics quoted above, I&rsquo;d like to see them.  People who claim statistical facts with no referrence cannot be taken terribly seriously.  Perhaps she is too young to remember how the feminist movement declared the white man as the evil in the world and called for his extinction?  Feminism was loudly prominent in encouraging white women to take non-whites as mates for political reasons.  Obama&rsquo;s mother was one of those.  The campaign has changed, but it became prominent on college campuses, and now it is prominent in the media and political dialogue, albeit in a indirect manner, so that now on college campuses it is institutionalized as Diverity and Multiculturalism and in creation of the Protected Groups, which is really a way of sending white men to the back of the line (bus?) over and over.  Perhaps that is the result in white women becoming so difficult and critical of white men, while famously dating every non-white they can, that the men have been forced to find a livable alternative?  And Asiam women seem to like white men.  I think that the Gen&rsquo;Xers completely miss this because they were born into a process in progress.  Perhaps more white women should look in the mirror.  I can guarantee you that we want our own women.  </p>
<p>However, more to the real point is the biological truth that when a woman miscegenates, she births a miscengenated child.  This usually means that she is no longer available for the birthing of non-mixed children for many reasons, but basically because the woman who does this also has converted to the males racial and ethnic communitie&rsquo;s culture.  Therefore, the offspring are more likely to mate with members of that group, and so delude the original genetics further. When a male miscegenates, he inseminates a woman with his dna.  This is a benefit for his racial genepool even if she is of a different race because in the epoch of evolution, the greater preservation of genetic characteristics everywhere increases the probability that those characteristics could become prominent in a groups genepool through later evolutionary pressures.  As as in the example above the resultant child&rsquo;s likely mates are determined by her having remained in his group, at least culturally.  This is why in most cases, even in the event of the absence of the father, the mother still gravitates toward his culture and the children are eventually assimilated into the dominant racial makeup of the cultural group.  It is basic math that determines what racial expressions become dominant.  If 100 white females are set in a commuity of 1,000 black males, by three generations there will likely be no identifiable white present, even if some European genetic characteristics can be observed.  (Does this ever open up a big discussion!  Think of the competition of hte males for the 100 white females.  Perhaps this actually does go on in the black community today?)  Since the males will select mates due to the more desireable characteristics, if other enviromental conditions, like less sunlight predominate, eventually a &#8220;white&#8221; population will evolve.  Would it be exactly the same as the original white mother? Most likely not, and the culture and ethnicity of the white would be lost forever.  I think this is the root of the resistance in a regrettable small pool of whites who realize that if they love themselves they MUST work to enlighten other whites to their own precious racial and cultural identities.  Those identities have been deluded and adulteratted, especially during the American Epoch, and even the Christian Epoch, but that there is some small effort by way of websites like American Renaissance is a good thing.  The alternative is to lay over and die. </p>

		<p>RaceRealistRick is wrong when he says that the Celts did not submit to the might of Rome.They were so comprehensively thrashed by Julius Caesar in Gaul that latin culture became sufficiently entrenched to resist all later incursions into the region,including those of the germanic Franks,who failed to impose their own language despite giving the place a new name,France.The Romans also conquered Britain,which at the time was populated almost entirely by Welsh-speaking Celts(there were a few Picts in the far north and their racial origins are unknown)and remained in control for around four hundred years until they were chased out by the invading English,who subsequently drove the Welsh into the western fringes of the island.Ireland was left alone by both the Romans and (for about 800 years)the English,who did not consider it important enough to conquer.</p>

<p>Well, as a former northerner, I certainly see where the South upped the north: they fought a larger army, a better prepared army, and a more unscrupulous army without resorting to the mass destruction and pillaging like the northern imperialists.  I understand why the South holds on to the bitterness of the war (it&rsquo;s the same reason us other whites empathize/sympathize with the South and despise the federal government).  My only two complaints with the South and Southerners is that they imported the Africans in the first place and they shun northern-born fellow Rebels!
