			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Keith B. Richburg, Washington Post, December 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nicole Vos, 19, has been modeling in Canada for four years and was doing runway shows for Toronto Fashion Week when &#8220;my agency one day just told me that I&rsquo;m going to China.&#8221; Now just halfway through her three-month contract in Beijing, Vos has been photographed for catalogues, magazines and commercials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vos isn&rsquo;t alone. Western models, it seems, are everywhere these days in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China: on department store display ads, in catalogues for clothing brands, on billboards, in commercials and on the runways at fashion shows. They are blue-eyed American and Canadian blondes like Vos, sultry Eastern European brunettes and hunky male bodybuilders with Los Angeles tans and six-pack abs selling products from jeans to underwear.</p>
<p>A walk through the Guiyou department store in central Beijing is instructive. On the third and fourth floors, where designer brands from Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are showcased, there&rsquo;s a display of a blonde modeling over-the-knee boots and red-and-black pumps for Hongke shoes. A pouty brunette advertises Baykal, a local brand of wool products. Even the mannequins have Western features.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ou Haibin, head of the Yuanjin Modeling Agency in Shenzhen, said 20 to 30 modeling agencies in China use foreigners, and 300 to 500 Western models are here during any given month, almost always on short-term contracts of up to three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;My clients feel that their products will look international if they use foreign models,&#8221; Ou said, and so they are willing to pay the higher fees, which are about a third to a half higher than those for Chinese models.</p>
<p>Then there is the matter of the Chinese sense of what constitutes beauty in a globalized world. &#8220;The foreign models&rsquo; faces are much more three-dimensional,&#8221; Ou said. &#8220;They look nicer in pictures.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that he never hires black models. &#8220;Our clients don&rsquo;t ask for black models,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s an issue of Chinese people&rsquo;s aesthetic view.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jezlan Moyet Decator, 22, was modeling in Los Angeles when her &#8220;mother agency&#8221; told her there was a talent scout from Beijing. &#8220;We sat, we chatted for maybe half an hour,&#8221; she said. Two weeks later he sent her a ticket to Beijing.</p>
<p>The scout was Mike Chen, originally from Las Vegas. Chen said he usually brings over 10 to 15 girls each month. And he knows what type of models will make the cut for his clients in Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the summertime, it&rsquo;s usually blondes,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;For the winter collection, it&rsquo;s more likely they want brunettes.&#8221; Brunettes, he said, photograph better in furs. He&rsquo;s not big on height, and prefers a fuller figure. But most important, he added, &#8220;it&rsquo;s all about attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Brandon Waarbroek, who is 28 but looks much younger, is one of the few male models on the Beijing circuit. He was working as an instructor at a small gym in Southern California and doing some modeling when Chen sent him to China. Now he&rsquo;s planning to return, to learn Chinese and maybe even go into business here. &#8220;I love China  &mdash;  I really love it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Waarbroek also tried to explain his take on the local fascination with foreign models. &#8220;The fascination is they look different,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They might have a million models who are Chinese. They like what they don&rsquo;t have, like tall blondes.&#8221; In his case, he said, &#8220;they really like muscle here, and there&rsquo;s not a lot of us.&#8221;</p>

		<p>For whatever reason, San Francisco?, there seemed to be a strong Chinese American element to &#8220;My Three Sons&#8221;. Remember? One episode had a teenage hottie become Robbie Douglas slave,Chinese style, after he saved her life. The other I`ve never forgotton after forty five years. It`s where they go to Hong-Kong and Uncle Charlie hooks up with his Kowloon bar girlfriend after fifty years. And they stand on that famous mountain and one of them goes, &#8220;How many people get to stand on top of Victoria mountain twice in one lifetime&#8221;? For some reason that viginette represented life for me somehowand still does&hellip;</p>

Hey! I thought Asian women were the most beautiful, have perfect skin, and so on. Why would the Chinese master race want to look at blemish skin white women? <br>

		<p>Is it a victory for white people? Don&rsquo;t they have anything more important what Chinese people&rsquo;s aesthetic view is? Why don&rsquo;t they try to emphasize on intelligence, rather than beauty? </p>
<p>For example, blonde people have clearly highest IQs among Europeans (Germans, Poles, Scandinavians, etc..). Why are blondes ALWAWS depicted as stupid? Who decides who is intelligent or stupid? However, nobody asks this question.</p>

		<p>What exactly is there to understand about this?</p>
<p>For generations, orientals and non-african people of color have used white genes to further their own races.  Usually, this has taken the form of any white man who comes to these countries having access to as many women as he wants for easy sex.  Today, this impulse drives the tourism of many of these countries.  White men go to these countries because they know they will have sex with multiple partners thrown at them&hellip;.often in the form of prostitution but just as much access in the form of legitimate liasons (or somewhere inbetween depending how how sane the culture is).  For example, many white men know that they can go to most south american countries and instantly find a &#8220;girlfriend&#8221;.  He is expected to buy her nice things, take her out to fancy places, occassionally give her money.  But she is not and does not consider herself a prostitute.  She is somewhere in between&hellip;.a situation that has developed because the culture she belongs to isn&rsquo;t very sane.  People don&rsquo;t form stable marriages often where the man takes care of the woman for life and raises children in a loving family.</p>
<p>But it is genetic desirability, not economic incentive that drives this behavior.  The culture wants our genes.  But the man himself isn&rsquo;t wanted.  Japan is a good example.  A wealthy nation where a white man can get laid easily&hellip;..but marrying the woman is quite another thing.</p>
<p>The popularity of white models in these countries is just a symptom of this.  An interesting observation.  Why are white men hunted down by the women from these cultures but the white women are not?  Simple.  A man leaves afterward and leaves his genes behind.  The woman can&rsquo;t contribute to the gene pool unless she stays.</p>
<p>The genes are wanted.  The person is not.</p>
<p>You see this behavior throughout many countries and througout history&hellip;.china, japan, india, throughout south america.  In many places, these genes form the basis of the ruling classes in these countries.</p>
<p>One has to wonder&hellip;.how much of asian IQ actually comes from the deliberate addition of white genes generation after generation.</p>

<p>Hmmm&hellip;????</p>
<p>Has anyone informed the resident Hong Kong guru of beauty standards here at AR, Comrade John Liu of this? He had better get on the phone with the PRC and let them know (despite the fact, that he claims to be married to a white woman) that Asians find white people &ldquo;repulsive&rdquo; and &ldquo;grotesque,&rdquo; amongst other things such as &ldquo;smelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh I know, he would likely come up with some mindless &ldquo;theory&rdquo; that China is &ldquo;enslaving&rdquo; these attractive young whites and gaining &ldquo;revenge&rdquo; for the Opium Wars or some other such nonsense!</p>
<p>But what was it that Polonius said his son Laertes in &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; Comrade Liu?</p>
<p>Something like: &ldquo;This above all: to thine own self be true,/And it must follow, as the night the day,/Thou cans&rsquo;t not be false to any man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know Comrade Liu, it is too long to fit in a fortune cookie, so you missed that one!</p>

		<p>To &#8220;John Liu&#8221; and White Liberals: Please spare us the &#8220;Whitey is racist&#8221; and convinced the poor oppresed Chinese that Whites were more beautiful so they could &#8220;control the fashion industry&#8221; stuff. Whitey is so bad that they have to be in charge of even the fashion industry. I can&rsquo;t wait to hear the absurd liberal excuses for the &#8220;oppressed&#8221; Chinese.</p>

		<p>Chinese women are not beautiful to me.  Compared to white women, Chinese women don&rsquo;t have the classic looks of beauty. They could be all sisters!</p>
<p>In reply to John Liu who said, </p>
<p>&#8220;But it is genetic desirability, not economic incentive that drives this behavior. The culture wants our genes. But the man himself isn&rsquo;t wanted. Japan is a good example. A wealthy nation where a white man can get laid easily&hellip;..but marrying the woman is quite another thing&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.I lived in Japan for 1 year and let me enlighten you, many Japanese women marry white guys and it is accepted and even promoted amongst some Japanese parents. </p>
<p>John, you really have a way of talking yourself into a corner, this exposes your stupidity. Just accept that Asian women prefer white men and there are many white men who prefer Asian women. But beware silly old white man, there are gold diggers in Asia who will rob you blind. Many of these asian gold diggers have ulterior motives, they will take everything.</p>
