<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20091223/US.Black.Unemployment/">Black Advocates Want More Help for the Unemployed</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, Comcast News, December 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is a growing outcry among black advocates for the Obama administration to target black joblessness with similar training programs and direct job creation.</p>
<p>Black unemployment has climbed from 8.9 percent to 15.6 percent since the recession began in December 2007. In comparison, the nation&rsquo;s overall rate has risen from 4.9 to 10.0 percent. The white rate climbed from 4.4 percent to 9.3 percent.</p>
<p>Although the gap between black and white unemployment has narrowed, there has been a 1.2 percent decline in the black labor force participation rate, more than any other group  &mdash;  which means that fewer blacks are even looking for work. That has held down the black unemployment rate, because such &#8220;discouraged workers&#8221; are not included in unemployment statistics.</p>
<p>The Congressional Black Caucus recently sent a letter to President Barack Obama asking for $139 billion in unused bank bailout funds to be spent on a long list of training programs and job-creation efforts, including jobs directly created with federal dollars.</p>
<p>It would be unconstitutional to designate aid or jobs specifically for blacks, so the CBC is asking for at least 10 percent of various funds to be spent in areas where 20 percent of the population is below the poverty line.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama, walking a tightrope on minority issues as the nation&rsquo;s first black president, has long maintained that he needs to focus on improving employment for everyone, not just for blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot pass laws that say &#8216;I&rsquo;m just helping black folks.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m the president of the entire United States,&#8221; Obama told American Urban Radio Networks on Monday. &#8220;What I can do is make sure that I am passing laws that help all people, particularly those who are most vulnerable and most in need. That in turn is going to help lift up the African-American community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama recently proposed some small business tax credits and tax breaks to encourage hiring. A $174 billion jobs package approved Wednesday by the House includes $2 billion for job training, summer jobs for teenagers and Americorps.</p>
<p>But the disproportionate lack of skills and education among blacks requires a unique solution, Nelson [Robert C. Nelson, president and CEO of the Philadelphia Opportunities Industrialization Center] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others say the best way to help unemployed blacks is not through job training programs, but by creating jobs in the private sector through tax breaks and lowering the minimum wage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor, says lowering the minimum wage would immediately boost black employment. And instead of jobs funded by the federal government, focusing on education is a better idea, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But numerous studies show that when white and black workers with identical qualifications apply to the same job, &#8220;they consistently favor the white applicants, even though the black applicants are equally qualified,&#8221; said Algernon Austin, director of the Race, Ethnicity and the Economy program at the Economic Policy Institute.</p>
<p>Among workers with a college education, for example, blacks have a higher unemployment rate, which shows that discrimination is still a major barrier to black employment, said Austin, author of a recent paper titled &#8220;Getting Good Jobs to America&rsquo;s People of Color.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thought the CBC proposals would help close the black-white unemployment gap, &#8220;but I don&rsquo;t know what they have in there to address discrimination.&#8221;<br>

		<p>If these black advocates want help for the unemployed, then they should be helping whites.  For it is whites that are losing the most in this economy.  Blacks at least have affirmative action in hiring, retention and promotion.  And now with this President, the Federal government his hiring black women like crazy, and paying them far better than the private sector does.  </p>

		<p>I worked in a plant that is closing. The majority of this plant was black and almost every single person has stated out loud that they were NOT going back to work any time soon. Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there are some 25+ year employees that deserve some time off but most of them will milk every last dime out of unemployment before they even look for a job! But the question is WHY should the black workers get any special treatment over the white ones? BTW many whites have left to other jobs, they did not wait until the plant closed. </p>

		<p>A while back I read that close to 25% of public employees (I won&rsquo;t say Civil Servants because most are not very civil) are black.  Doesn&rsquo;t that rank as help for the unemployed since it seems most blacks employed by the government would have a hard time maintaining employment in the private sector, despite all the anti-employer laws on the books.</p>

		<p>Discrimination being a factor in unemployment&hellip; Dont make me laugh. If you look at what college educated blacks have as their degree you will understand why they are not employed at higher rates. I could imagine that the job market is pretty tight for ethnic studies majors, which is just about what most of them go into. I would venture a bet that the few intellegent blacks that go into things like engineering, accounting or archetechture do just fine. </p>

		<p>There are essentially three reasons why blacks chronically have higher unemployment rates than other races.</p>
<p>One, many are content to be unemployed and collect welfare and/or unemployment insurance.</p>
<p>Two, they generally are less qualified for any given line of work than members of most other racial groups.</p>
<p>Three, employers know from long experience that to hire blacks for any given position is to invite trouble, both in terms of job performance and in terms of separating them in the likely event of non-performance.</p>
<p>Black unemployment is perfectly explicable.</p>

		<p> help unemployed blacks is not through job training programs, but by creating jobs in the private sector </p>
<p>So, we CREATE jobs for  BLACKS who are not TRAINED to do those jobs? Just leave them on welfare. To put them in the private sector is just putting another White employer in the Ghetto Lottery parade and making the employer vulnerable to the usual lawsuits. Sooner or later, white businesses are gonna get tired of this circus.</p>

<p>Thanks to affirmative action, employers need to assume that blacks are actually LESS qualified than their white counterparts even if they both have the same documentation; Affirmative action is so pervasive that a diploma, in the hands of a black, is worth less than the same diploma in the hands of a white.  If they truly want employers to view blacks as equals, then they should call for an end to all affirmative action programs.</p>

		<p>So blacks are demanding more help for the unemployed blacks?  How about training them in a new set of values - like getting an honest education, be it VOCATIONAL TRAINING, or college, in a major that pays, like business?  How about training them to understand that holding their hand out to the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t is merely a transfer of the ancient practice of holding their hand out to &#8220;massa&#8221; for their every need?  How about training them in entrepreneurship, so that they could get into the business world and take their chances like everybody else?  Oh - I forgot - they want a &#8220;level playing field&#8221; first.  Right.  Well, did someone forget to tell them that a level playing field is exactly the same as a straight line on a heart monitor?  DEAD, that&rsquo;s what it means - only life has ups and downs, and that is so for everybody.  Get real, you bums.  We&rsquo;re sick of supporting you and your whining!</p>

		<p>This is the kind of problem you get when a country stops being homogeneous and middle-class. Whereas before a single government policy could be counted on to help everyone, now you need one policy for whites and another for blacks. With so much diversity it gets very complicated. </p>

<p>Skip:</p>
<p>In California, they already are.</p>
<p>Businesses that haven&rsquo;t been driven out of here through onerous regulations and satanic taxes, and are operating on a thin line as it is, hire mexicans or central americans, never blacks.</p>
<p>That way, they can get around non-White AA requirements, pay the majority of their workers in cash or a mix of cash and payroll and escape the heavy employer tax burden.  They also don&rsquo;t have to deal with screams of racism, the threat of being sued or the lazy black work ethic.  One of several reasons these businesses back and fund candidates that favor open borders. It&rsquo;s a winning situation for them and has made some of them very rich (at taxpayer expense, of course).</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen many workplace discrimination or workplace safety violation cases with mexicans as the plaintiffs but as they gain more political power I expect this to increase  &mdash;  driving the remaining businesses right out of the state.</p>

		<p>One thing I think most people have not considered is the number of blacks who actually ARE employed (sortof) but in the black market.  They sell guns, drugs, prostitutes etc.</p>
<p>These people are counted as unemployed (most still collect their welfare, lol) yet they are usually the richest people in black neighborhoods.  Why?  Because blacks value their services higher than anything else, including the basics of survival.</p>
<p>Which brings up another issue.  How much of AA, welfare, and &#8220;help for the unemployed&#8221; ends up in the criminal underground.</p>
<p>This has always been a problem with welfare.  So called welfare &#8220;reform&#8221; at least made a reasonable attempt to make sure that money was spent on food, clothing, shelter.  However, the shift away from welfare to AA actually sabotages this.</p>
<p>In exchange for worthless, incompetent services (if they even bother to show up for work or do any work whatsoever if they do show up), they get a paycheck.  Since its a job, and now their own money, the government gets no say in how they spend it.  What they spend it on, mostly, is drugs and other vice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you see odd occurences like a high level AA pulling $200k a year (even though they can&rsquo;t read) yet they are deeply in debt and have no savings.</p>
<p>Where does all that money go?  A plasma screen tv and other goodies only cost so much.</p>

		<p>I am a 45yo white male who has been unemployed since July (Thank you, Hope and Change), I used to make $3K per month (gross), now I am collecting $250 a week in unemployment and I have a mortgage payment. Because I am a homeowner I cannot even collect food stamps (&#8220;Sheniqua&#8221; at that office says I should refinance my home to get more money for groceries)</p>
<p>I just want a job not a handout. </p>
<p>A job is the best welfare program around. </p>

<p>They can not use the value of your home to deny you Food Stamps.  Go to the USDA - Food and Nutrition Service web site and read up on the eligibility rules for the Food Stamp program (now called the Supplemental Nutrional Assistance Program).</p>

		<p>I recently took a nurse&rsquo;s aide class through workforce investment, and was dismayed to learn that my black classmates were held to a different standard  &mdash;   a lower one  &mdash;   than myself.  I was required to provide written updates of my progress; they were only required to phone in with casual reports.  I had to jump through hoops to prove that I met the requirements to receive federal funding; they merely had to ask. </p>
<p>Those most deserving of help are often overlooked.  To be poor and white under the Obama administration means you are left to fend entirely for yourself.  Pity the poor person who does not realize this. </p>

<p>Of Course! Smart employers choose WHITEs for the job because if they do NOT work out, they can fire the WHITE employee, while the black &#8220;equally qualified&#8221; employee is nearly impossible to remove due to various AA protections! </p>
<p>Whites have essentially NO rights, and NO recourse when fired. Besides our better work ethic and higher IQ, having NO rights is a bonus. Why wouldnt a smart employer choose us? </p>
