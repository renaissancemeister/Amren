<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/us/14gangs.html">Gang Violence Grows on an Indian Reservation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erik Eckholm, New York Times, December 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson is one of 5,000 young men from the Oglala Sioux tribe involved with at least 39 gangs on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The gangs are being blamed for an increase in vandalism, theft, violence and fear that is altering the texture of life here and in other parts of American Indian territory.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Groups like Wild Boyz, TBZ, Nomads and Indian Mafia draw children from broken, alcohol-ravaged homes, like Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s, offering brotherhood, an identity drawn from urban gangsta rap and self-protection.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps unique to reservations, rivals sometimes pelt one other with cans of food from the federal commodity program, a practice called &#8220;commod-squadding.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Christopher M. Grant, who used to head a police antigang unit in Rapid City, S.D., and is now a consultant on gangs to several tribes and federal agencies, has noted the &#8220;marked increase in gang activity, particularly on reservations in the Midwest, the Northwest and the Southwest&#8221; over the last five to seven years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the gangs in Pine Ridge, like the Tre Tre Crips, were started by tribal members who encountered them in prison or while living off the reservation; others have taken their names and colors from movies and records.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re trying to give an identity back to our youth,&#8221; said Melvyn Young Bear, the tribe&rsquo;s appointed cultural liaison. &#8220;They&rsquo;re into the subculture of African-Americans and Latinos. But they are Lakota, and they have a lot to be proud of.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is what we want for our Euro-American children.  They, too, have a lot to be proud of.</p>

		<p>Even though large numbers of Indians live on welfare and have spent their lives w/out once looking for a job the original article states that &#8220;Attorney General Eric Holder has proposed large increases in money&#8221; for the reservations.</p>
<p>Splendid.</p>

		<p>At least it&rsquo;s somewhat comforting that older Lakota Sioux are concerned that their young people are adopting the &#8220;culture&#8221; of black and Hispanic youth.</p>
<p>In that respect they&rsquo;re just like middle-class whites.</p>

<p>Absolutely! 100 % right, and I have no problem with this pronouncement. </p>
<p>Going the way of the black and hispanic is the route to disaster. YET, even for whites sometimes too, being so &#8220;COOOOOOL&#8221; by imitating a black or a hispanic gang member is seen as the way to go.</p>
<p>I fear that already a significant part of our society has gone bad by trying to be &#8220;COOOOOOOL&#8221; in way that is not &#8220;COOOOOOL&#8221;.</p>

		<p>These young Lakota American Indians are not the only ones who have been influenced in that particular way&hellip;</p>
<p>In the US, in Canada, and in many European countries, young Whites have adopted the clothing, the lingua, the attitude, the entire popular subculture of American Blacks living in ghettos.</p>
<p>Even Latinos, usually awfully proud about their culture and origins, have given up part of their identity to look and act «Blacker», so to speak.</p>
<p>I guess we should, at leat partly for the creation of this state of affairs, thank Mister Sumner Redstone. He is the owner of MTV and of Viacom.</p>
<p>I think one of the things we must do, is to as soon as possible, de-Black the way our youth behave and think. </p>

<p>As a younger person, I spent time in Germany. The German youth worshipped black gangsta rap like a religion. It was worse than here. At least some American youths take this music with a grain of salt. I tried to warn the Germans against this subculture. I even offered, &#8220;if you like black music, listen to Louis Armstrong or Nat King Cole. They are respectable musicians.&#8221; The German youth would turn their noses up at me, &#8220;You Americans are so racist and Ignorant. You don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.&#8221; I guess they will find out what I&rsquo;m talking about soon enough.</p>

		<p>This would seem to be a logical argument for segregated prisons, though, wouldn&rsquo;t it?  And if that is true, then it&rsquo;s a clear argument for segregated society.  When non-blacks hang out with blacks and hispanics, the blacks and hispanics are NOT elevated.  The non-blacks and non-hispanics are dragged down to the level of the blacks.  How many decades of this empirical evidence must we suffer before we DEMAND IT END?  ALL of valid scientific evidence and hypothesis is proven by OBSERVABLE results.  We have had four decades of the observable results of integration.  Blacks have NOT been improved or elevated.  Whites ARE degenerating into savagery and black criminal behavior instead.</p>
