<h1><a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/widow-post/?emc=eta1">A Stamp in a Passport Ends a Long Struggle for Residency</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kirk Semple, New York Times, December 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, Ms. Robinson [Osserritta Robinson, a Jamaican immigrant and widow], 32, once again sat for a residency interview in a federal office building in Newark. But this time, she had the weight of a new law behind her: On Oct. 28, President Obama signed legislation that enabled all widows and widowers of American citizens to apply for permanent residency regardless of how long the couple were married.</p>
<p>When Ms. Robinson walked out of the federal building an hour later, she had a stamp in her passport that granted her permanent residency.</p>

		<p>Oh goody, now illegal aliens can marry US citizens on their death beds and get green cards!  Hmmm, so an illegal gives a dying woman&rsquo;s daughter $10,000 and the woman marries him.  He gets the green card and the woman gets to leave her off spring a little inheritance.  Sweet!<br>

		<p>I don`t disagree. Key phrase  for me being widow and widower. It`s not like they scammed a citizen then  got an anulment. Go ahead the check the kithen cupboard  for DCon and arsenic while you at it though.  Now the question is that I should know already&hellip;. What rights does a citizen have that a permanent resident doesn`t?&hellip; </p>

		<p>I foresee illegal hispanics - especially young females - marrying whites (older males) and for some strange reason these males passing away early.  I then foresee the now widowed illegal hispanics getting their US citizenship, and immediately bringing their family in from mexico et al.  </p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take that long to get permanent residency. If someone wasn&rsquo;t married long enough to get it then they shouldn&rsquo;t have it.</p>

		<p>I can see this working out for a man who marries an American woman, but an illegal alien female can just get pregnant to be allowed to stay in the country. She doesn&rsquo;t have to bother with the whole marriage part   &mdash;  - since we all pay for her offspring. </p>

		<p>These would be anchor husbands rather than anchor babies. </p>
<p>It makes no sense to automatically grant anyone permanent residency based on marital status. The merits of each case should be considered. This is just opening another loophole.</p>

<p>In the book &#8220;What Every Cop Knows&#8221;, there is a passage where the Chicago cops describe how these foreign mail order bride marriages usually end in about a year, a large percentage of them, because of the fifty year old white man [married to a twenty-something Filipino woman] dying of a heart attack!</p>
<p>A high percentage, much more than normal, apparently heart attack, the real cause more probably being DIGITALIS!!</p>
<p>This has been going on - - for some time?? Decades maybe??</p>

		<p>I think all illegal aliens, wherever they are from, should be arrested and put to work at menial but necessary tasks such as public sanitation, cooking for prisons or even infrastructure development. Then, after they have learned some valuable skills, they get deported to their native lands and put those new, valuable skills to work building their own economies instead of stealing our jobs and resources.</p>
<p>USA for USA!</p>
