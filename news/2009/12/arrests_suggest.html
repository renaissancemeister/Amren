	<p>A spike in terrorism cases involving U.S. citizens is challenging long-held assumptions that Muslims in Europe are more susceptible to radicalization than their better-assimilated counterparts in the United States.</p>
<p>Four investigations disclosed in the past 12 months, including the arrests of five Northern Virginia men in Pakistan this week, underscore what the Obama administration asserts is a domestic threat emanating from Americans training overseas with al-Qaeda and related terrorist groups in Pakistan. &#8220;We have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror,&#8221; President Obama said this month in announcing plans to deploy 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>American Muslim organizations, jolted by the spate of cases, are abandoning their hesitation to speak out about the issue. While underlining that only a tiny minority has become radicalized, two major groups  &mdash;  the Muslim Public Affairs Council and the Council on American-Islamic Relations  &mdash;  said this week that they would launch counter-radicalization programs aimed at young people.</p>
<p>Several U.S. and international terrorism analysts say that American Muslims, as a group, remain more prosperous, assimilated and moderate than those in Europe. But the analysts also note that immigration trends, the global spread of a militant Islamism and controversial actions by the United States and its allies since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks increase the chances that U.S. Muslims could carry out a domestic attack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before 2004, Britons in terrorist training abroad looked for overseas targets such as Israel or South Asia, Gohel said. Over the next two years, as British troops fought alongside Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan, Britain was stunned by at least four bomb plots by Britons linked to al-Qaeda  &mdash;  and the July 7, 2005, attack on the London transit system that killed 52 people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Worse in Europe?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But just as British authorities identified disenchanted elements among its 800,000-strong Pakistani community, several Pakistani Americans have been detained this fall in cases linked to extremists in Pakistan. At least three of the five Virginia residents were in touch with a Taliban recruiter, according to Pakistani authorities. Other examples include David C. Headley, a U.S. citizen from Chicago who was accused this week of helping to plot the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.</p>
<p>Najibullah Zazi, 24, a Denver airport shuttle driver and U.S. permanent resident who was born in Afghanistan and reared in Pakistan, was charged in September of testing explosives for an attack, possibly in New York.</p>
<p>The cases of radicalization are not limited to Pakistani Americans. In January, Bryant N. Vinas, 26, a Hispanic American convert to Islam, pleaded guilty to receiving training from al-Qaeda in Pakistan last year.</p>
<p>Daniel P. Boyd, a white Muslim convert who lives in North Carolina, was accused this summer of plotting to attack U.S. military personnel at Quantico, and of leading a group of seven men to fight in the Middle East after Israel&rsquo;s 2006 war with the group Hezbollah. Last month, U.S. authorities announced the latest of 14 indictments related to the alleged recruiting of more than 20 Somali American youths from Minnesota to join an Islamist insurgency in Somalia. U.S.-backed Ethiopian forces toppled an Islamist government in Somalia in 2006.</p>
<p><b>Concern about Somalis</b></p>
<p>Somali Americans are among the youngest, poorest and newest immigrants to the United States, with 60 percent having arrived since 2000 and 51 percent living in poverty.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to look very hard at those who arrived in the last 10 or 15 years,&#8221; said Charles Allen, a veteran CIA officer and chief intelligence officer for the Homeland Security Department from 2005 until this year. &#8220;We&rsquo;re having this problem with Somalis, and we&rsquo;re having it with Pakistanis, and there will be other nations as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. authorities said the American Muslim community is central to countering extremism. In the Minnesota and Virginia cases, parents and community leaders sounded the alarm when the youths disappeared.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Haris Tarin, the Washington director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said that imams and community leaders in the United States have undergone a profound &#8220;shift in attitude&#8221; about the extent of the problem.</p>

		<p>I object to the presumptuous tone of this article.  To take it at face value, then we are to think that all human beings are the same, vast, empty slates at birth, and that the only reason certain individuals who adhere to a certain faith turn into terrorists is because they have extremist things written on the slate as they age.  I am of the mindset that you don&rsquo;t need to &#8220;radicalize&#8221; them to turn them into terrorists   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re already radical by nature.</p>

		<p>We would expect that any Muslim who loved his religion and his people would fight against those who were killing his fellow Muslims and kin,  just as we would expect any good American to fight against those who attacked us on 9-11.</p>
<p>The Muslims who fight against us are &#8220;patriots&#8221; to their people, the same way that our soldiers are patriot for America.  </p>
<p>This is why it is a really bad idea to continue to import millions of Muslims into the USA. Why does our government continue to do so?</p>
<p>END MUSLIM IMMIGRATION NOW!  </p>

<p>Is there any group in the US besides whites that regard this country as theirs above everey other in the world and are ready to protect and defend it patriotically?</p>
<p>OF COURSE THERE IS NOT!  Every tribe that arrives here from around the world&hellip;.especially Mexicans&hellip;.regard this country as only a place to live and make money, and they give first loyalty to their countries of origin.  That includes many non-whites who are born here, and almost every black in the nation.</p>
<p>The self-appointed elites who think that crossing an imaginary line automatically instills patriotism, loyalty, and gratitude, are the same out of touch fools that have this empire on the verge of collapse. </p>
<p>The melting pot theory was correct when it concerned Europeans, and only Europeans.  Expecting any other race to embrace this nation the same way whites do is the dream of an idiotic fool.</p>
<p>The founders knew this.  They made the constitution for whites and it is only whites who deserve to live here.  Our people founded, settled and built this modern day marvel.  Nobody but Europeans should be living here right now.  </p>
<p>Any whites who disagree with that premise should be ousted as well.  They&rsquo;re even worse than the US hating non-whites whose one great desire is to take control of the country and make it a replica of the failed society they left, with all its customs, language and traditions.</p>
<p>It is prosperity that is partially responsible for our situation, and it may well be the lack of prosperity that may get the majority of it back for us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.  The depression is drawing near, right in the middle of the false claims of a recovery being in progress.</p>

		<p>  They don&rsquo;t need to go to any other country to be radicalized. It is happening right here in the U.S. They have their own training camps set up in the northeast.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, Muslims can be radicalized ANYWHERE - and no doubt are, as we speak.  I think the FBI and CIA need to get serious about infiltrating U.S. mosques to see exactly what they&rsquo;re teaching after Friday services.  That&rsquo;s when the really radical stuff gets put out there.  They also need to be teaching <br>
Americans to speak, write and understand Arabic, so we have plenty of agents available for infiltration.  If they aren&rsquo;t doing that, they&rsquo;re leaving a vital task undone!!  </p>

		<p>Dear truredwhite&blue;, Post # 6,<br>
 <br>
I disagree that we should spend millions of Dollars infiltrating mosques and monitoring the millions of Muslims who have recently been imported into the USA.  A cheaper and more permanent solution is to simply send them back.  America gets few benefits from Muslim immigrants.  Our taxes are better spent on American Citizens than monitoring Muslim immigrants, and picking up body parts after terrorist acts.</p>

		<p>Dear Anonymous Post #7,</p>
<p>I wish we could send them back, but we can&rsquo;t.  Discrimination on the basis of religion and all that.  My suggestion to train Americans to speak, write, and understand Arabic is not just for infiltrating mosques, which sorely needs to be done, but it is also for intercepting all kinds of Arabic communication related to terrorism.  It has also been done before; there IS precedent for it.  Better to train our own than depend on Arab-born individuals who will probably turn on us, like that schmuck at Ft. Hood.</p>
