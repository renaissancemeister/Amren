<h1>African-American Group Challenges Cuba on Race</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juan O. Tamayo, Miami Herald, December 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of prominent African Americans, traditionally sympathetic to the Cuban revolution, have for the first time condemned Cuba, demanding Havana stop its &#8220;callous disregard&#8221; for black Cubans and declaring that &#8220;racism in Cuba .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must be confronted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We know first-hand the experiences and consequences of denying civil freedoms on the basis of race,&#8221; the group declared in a statement. &#8220;For that reason, we are even more obligated to voice our opinion on what is happening to our Cuban brethren.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the 60 signers were Princeton professor Cornel West, actress Ruby Dee Davis, film director Melvin Van Peebles, former South Florida congresswoman Carrie Meek, Dr. Jeremiah Wright, former pastor of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s church in Chicago, and Susan Taylor, former editor in chief of Essence magazine.</p>
<p>NEW VOICES</p>
<p>The declaration, issued Monday, adds powerful new voices to the chorus pushing for change on the island, where Afro-Cubans make up at least 62 percent of the 11.4 million people yet are only thinly represented in the top leadership, scientific, academic and other ranks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A news release accompanying the statement acknowledged that &#8220;traditionally African Americans have sided with the Castro regime and condemned the United States&rsquo; policies, which explicitly work to topple the Cuban government.&#8221;</p>
<p>But more African Americans traveling to Cuba have been able &#8220;to see the situation for themselves,&#8221; said David Covin, one of the statement&rsquo;s organizers and former president of the National Conference of Black Political Scientists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alberto González, spokesman for Cuba&rsquo;s diplomatic mission in Washington, said it was &#8220;absurd&#8221; to accuse of racism a Cuban government that &#8220;has done more for black Cubans than any other in all areas, including health, education and welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>The African Americans&rsquo; statement was &#8220;part of a campaign of subversion against Cuba,&#8221; he added, designed to impact the administration of the first African-American president of the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>AUTHOR&rsquo;S CRUSADE</p>
<p>The statement was largely driven by Carlos Moore, a highly regarded Cuban author and black rights activist living in Brazil who has long criticized racial discrimination in Cuba.</p>
<p>Moore persuaded Abdias Nascimiento, a founder of Brazil&rsquo;s black movement and longtime Castro supporter, to send Raúl Castro a letter earlier this year denouncing racism in Cuba, then appealed to friends and contacts in the African-American community to add their support.</p>
<p>Jamaican-Nigerian author Lindsay Barret, who confessed he had been &#8220;an almost uncritical supporter&#8221; of the Cuban government, also added his voice to the chorus of attacks on Cuba with a column he wrote for Nigeria&rsquo;s The Sun newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. both disappointing and distressing for me at this point to have to acknowledge that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Carlos Moore&rsquo;s challenging assertions are beginning to ring true fifty years after we allowed ourselves to be enchanted by the glamour and courage of the Cuban insurgency,&#8221; Barret wrote.<br>

<p>Wow! Even authentic communists won&rsquo;t tolerate affirmative action just so they can boast about inclusivity and diversity. Even authentic communists won&rsquo;t reward people for failure, like we do in this country. I never thought we could learn a lesson from communists, yet here we have it: You must earn your keep through your best efforts; success or failure is entirely up to the individual&hellip;At least that&rsquo;s been true in my White life. <br>

		<p>I think this is a simple story   &mdash;   some American black radicals are realizing that Castro used Cuba&rsquo;s blacks as a route to power, but are keeping enough distance between them and himself because he fears that another revolutionary will use them to topple him.  Or, &#8220;we&rsquo;ve been duped.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s what dupes do, get duped.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad that the Cuban leaders are having their noses rubbed in their own stuff, and I do believe that this group of &#8220;prominent&#8221; African Americans are burning a bridge as Cuba has ALWAYS been their biggest supporter against their White &#8220;oppresser&#8221;. When will the world start realizing that where there are Africans, there is chaos? I think that once the NAACP gets a whif of this, that will be the end of it.</p>

		<p>So the black Americans had to go all the way to Cuba to realize the Cuban government discriminated against black Cubans? Wow! All they had to do was go to Cuban run Miami to see this for themselves.  Those in power in Miami are the white Cubans who used to be those in power in Cuba before Castro overthrew them.  The white Cubans in Miami completely discriminate against black Cubans, black Americans, blacks from the other islands, and of course all the other Hispanics and white Americans.  But, the white Cubans in Miami are not shy about how they feel about blacks nor do they apologize for everything like white Americans do.  It&rsquo;s all about maintaining their power whether it&rsquo;s in Miami or Cuba and that&rsquo;s something white Americans could learn.</p>

<p>If blacks are thinly represented in the top ranks of Cuban Communist officialdom, the explanation may lie within my favorite quote by Che Guevara quote. Although not a Che quote that you&rsquo;ll find on very many T-shirts, a critical bio of Che from a few years ago assures us that the good doctor did indeed say the following about the proper place of blacks in Revolutionary Cuba:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Revolution will do for Cuba&rsquo;s blacks exactly what Cuba&rsquo;s blacks did for the Revolution   &mdash;   by which I mean NOTHING!&#8221;</p>

		<p>My wife and I (being British and retired inSpain) spent two weeks visiting Cuba three yars ago and one of the things i noticed was that all the basic cleaning and routine painting jobs were done by black people.  The room cleaners, kitchen and bar/restaurant staff were whites, inclufding the stage and restaurant  entertainmers.  During chats with a young male cuban my questions answered candidly revealed a lot about the Cuban mythh of it being heaven on Earth but I was told that HIV sufferers are treated like lepers and restricted to one part of the island and keptin quarantine.  The medical facilities though are very basic and would not be allowed as far as premises are concerned here in Spain and I guess the USA.  But the average Cuban we met wa svery pleasant although thenhotel staff expecetd to be tipped generously even before serving a watered-down drink.  Good place for a divorced man to pick up a young ghorgeous wife though even if she will turn out to be a domineering dragon once she has then one out and one spare to &#8220;safeguard&#8221; the marriage (i.e. two babies) as one of our Spanish neighbours has proved with his Cuban wife.  We were charged nearly $200 for excess baggage on leaving eve thoiughwe know we were underweight as we had much less in our cases than when we went there.  But they are desperate for good foreign currency.  But the sight of crumbling emty factories and decaying buildings is enough to illustrate the failures of the Communist dream.<br>

		<p>There are many Americans and &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; from the western world who won&rsquo;t want to hear this but it is important that you do.</p>
<p>The communists, although they are only too happy to use the darker races as a weapon of war against you and manipulate you with guilt, sympathy and altruism, they themselves are under no illusions whatsoever with regard to these people.</p>
<p>If these &#8220;prominant african americans&#8221; dare to take one step into these communist countries, they will be shot, beaten, imprisoned or all three.  And their fellow blacks will not only fall into line, they will love and respect the ones doing it.</p>
<p>Blacks are a slave race.  They will not and cannot function without a heavy dose of harsh slavery.  They won&rsquo;t tolerate it.  What it means for them to no live under the yoke in the western world is that they are of the opinion that THEY are the master and WE are the slaves.  And they will act on the premise to the limits of their power to do so (and dream of someday going way beyond that).  That&rsquo;s why there are so many black on white rapes, murders, assaults, robberies, etc.  They feel entitled to do those things.</p>
<p>Not so in communist countries.</p>
<p>Think about this.  Who is the respected hero in the black neighborhood?  The rich black that has a business, an education or a position, perhaps in the government (even though those things result from AA, not merit)?  No.  It&rsquo;s the pimp, the drug dealer, the murdering gang member who has been to prison.  The one who successfully enslaves others.</p>

		<p>Cuba has a pretty good handle on black crime, considering that they make up 62 percent of the population.  Maybe our own Africans would benefit from draconian, communist-style law enforcement.  </p>
<p>Or maybe at least our white population would benefit from it&hellip; </p>

		<p>The example of Haiti and Jamaica illustrates all too well what happens when Blacks get too much political power.  Cuba might be communist, but is not stupid - as they&rsquo;ve demonstrated over the past 50 years.  They tolerate the Blacks as they perhaps should, considering the size of the black population, but to let them into the administration and completely ruin the country is out of bounds even for this Marxist state.  How to continue to keep them out is  a conundrum they will have to face as the communist rule diminishes and misguided &#8216;human rights&rsquo; activists have more to say in the affairs of the country.  <br>
I wish them luck (the White Cubans, that is&hellip;).</p>

		<p>All this blather will fall on deaf ears. Cubans have clearly already made up their minds as to the status of blacks in their country and, unlike the West, have no PC mindset to discourage their own racial instincts. </p>

<p>He just doesn&rsquo;t get it. He doesn&rsquo;t understand (as we do) that blacks don&rsquo;t just want welfare, training for factory jobs, and free vaccinations;  they want HIGH, glamorous positions.  Like HIS! </p>

		<p>As I understand it, from reading elsewhere, in Cuba they promote and educate whoever is the most competent and the best qualified, regardless of race.  They are proud to say they do not use quotas or engage in bean counting. They don&rsquo;t care what race you are;  that doesn&rsquo;t matter. The only thing that counts is ability, not color. If some come out ahead of others, so be it.  Anything wrong with that? </p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s racism, then Mother Nature must be a racist.</p>

		<p>I have never been to Miami, but I get the impression that most Cubans who came to this country since the revolution are white.  Is this so?  Perhaps someone who is more familiar with the cuban nation-in-exile in south Florida can comment.</p>
<p>If it is true, that would indicate that cradle-to-grave socialism (especially when it&rsquo;s subsidized by the big russian socialist brother, as it was until 20 years ago) suits blacks pretty well.</p>
<p>But this may not always be the case.  With Cuba beginning to fall apart, we may see a vast exodus of black cubans to our shores.  And given the special immigration status that cubans are granted (automatic refugee status, I believe), we could be in for a great big diverse wallop of vibrant enrichment.</p>

		<p>The behavior of Cuban government isn&rsquo;t necessarily racist, it&rsquo;s simply meritocratic.</p>
<p>Also, let me remind you that true Communism has very little in common with American liberalism - with Communism, the main goal is the abolition of private property, and the doctrine isn&rsquo;t necessarily against discrimination when it comes to minorities such as blacks, homosexuals, and so on. Communism simply doesn&rsquo;t think in those terms, it thinks in terms of two classes only, the capitalists and the proletariat.</p>
