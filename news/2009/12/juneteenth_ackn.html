<h1>Juneteenth Acknowledged As Legal Holiday in Wisconsin, But Does It Matter to the Rest of America?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"Montie," ChicagoNow, December 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At a claims company I worked for several years ago, I took Juneteenth off. My African-American boss at the time supported the idea, but she didn&rsquo;t take the day off as well. She also continuously asked me when was the day again and what was the day for.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve run into several other people who have no idea what Juneteenth is. So when I received an email today about a Chicago Tribune article (courtesy of Associated Press) stating that Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle signed a bill to make Juneteenth a national holiday, I wondered how many people would actually take advantage of that.</p>
<p>How many people would find out the significance of June 19, 1865, the day when Union soldiers landed in Galveston, Texas, and there was an announcement that the Civil War was over and slavery had ended.</p>
<p>According to the Chicago Tribune report, Milwaukee has celebrated Juneteenth since the 1970s. {snip} But on an intimate social level, I&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find many African-Americans who do. I see African-Americans go above and beyond to celebrate the Fourth of July, even though it was not an Independence Day for us and we were still slaves during that time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But back to African-American history, Dr. King&rsquo;s birthday, which is a national holiday, is just another day off to some, and Black History Month can come and go without me seeing too many people take such interest in it the way other common holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July are celebrated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s lack of interest, lack of knowledge or the &#8220;get over it&#8221; mentality that makes some African-Americans in general so blahzay [sic] about Juneteenth, Black History Month or African-American history in general. I blame part of it on the textbooks used in schools. The shoddy paragraphs on African-American history out of an entire book surely don&rsquo;t explore the issues, and the fact that African-American history and African-American literature are still electives or not taught at all at most colleges and universities but British Literature or &#8220;American&#8221; Literature, which usually does not have much minority history incorporated in it, are required to graduate is blatantly disrespectful.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/78320337.html">Wisconsin Recognizes Juneteenth As State Holiday</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>CNN, December 2, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Wisconsin has joined more than 30 other states by declaring Juneteenth a legal holiday.</p>
<p>Juneteenth  &mdash;  observed on June 19  &mdash;  commemorates the day in 1865 when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce that the Civil War had ended and that slaves were free.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wisconsinites have commemorated the day since the 1970s, the governor&rsquo;s office said Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to more than 30 states legally recognizing the holiday, it has been exported to various parts of the world. Many African-American service people and others celebrate the day with events abroad.<br>

<p>The author, by his own words, shows us why Diversity and Multiculturalism is so dangerous.  It is because each race wants different things.  This causes friction and conflict, which pulls society apart.  Instead of all citizens having the same core believes and a shared culture, and working together for the common good, the different groups are each working for their own benefit.  This is why racial Diversity is our greatest weakness and why multiculturalism is dead.  The most successful long-lasting societies are homogeneous societies. <br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know which is funnier. The fact that the day had no significance until liberal race hustlers invented significance for it in the 70&rsquo;s or that significance failed to take hold to the point that people still have no idea.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that blacks don&rsquo;t care to know about it.</p>
<p>All these things illustrate that race, slavery etc. don&rsquo;t mean and never meant what liberals say they meant&hellip;.not to blacks and not to anyone else.</p>
<p>If all forms of welfare and other race payouts were ended, how long would these things maintain in the minds of Americans, especially blacks.  Decades?  Years?  Weeks?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a made up issue.</p>

		<p>Just looked it up. It is an official Texas State (Partial Staffing) Holiday. It means that State  Offices are open even though it is a declared holiday.. There are also days designated Optional Holidays. Cesear Chavez day is one. Some of the others are Confederate Heroes Day, Texas Independance Day and San Jacinto Day. Sorry about the Cheese State crack earlier. Down here anything North of Dallas is Yankee land and unknown territory&hellip; </p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read in the past, &#8220;Juneteenth&#8221; is nothing but barely controlled mayhem that is often marred by violence. I&rsquo;ll never know, because wild horses couldn&rsquo;t drag me to one, but I&rsquo;ll sooner read about a stampede of unicorns before hearing about a gathering of thousands of blacks that doesn&rsquo;t contain violence. It takes some kind of spineless idiot to support such a so-called holiday. I&rsquo;ll retire to Bedlam. </p>

Every year here in Buffalo, blacks celebrate the second largest Juneteenth in America. (I don&rsquo;t know whose celebration is bigger).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heavily hyped and promoted in the black media but frankly, I don&rsquo;t believe most blacks care. The turn out at MLK park is underwhelming.</p>

		<p>Now now, people&hellip;Juneteenth is a great holiday. In fact I think it should become a national holiday and replace Martin Luther King Day, because:</p>
<p>1) King was a leftist halway-to-communist liberal. He shouldn&rsquo;t have a day named after him.</p>
<p>2) Who the hell wants a day off in the deep of winter? It&rsquo;s not like you can have a cook out or go to the lake.</p>
<p>3) Juneteenth actually remembers that the people who contributed most to the civil rights of blacks were not the leftists Freedom Riders, but the 300,000 mostly WASP Americans in the Union Army who died during the Civil War.</p>

		<p>I find it hard to believe that blacks do not want another holiday for them. They can use it to take the day off from work.<br>
   Anywhay, there should be only one holiday for blacks. It should be the birthday of the man who freed them from slavery- William T. Sherman!</p>

		<p>Whites should all adopt this holiday as our own!  &#8220;I am taking Juneteenth off to commemorate (important word) the End of Slavery&#8221;.  Blacks may celebrate, if they wish.  Our people shall simply commemeorate, as we commemorate War Dead on Memorial Day.  We could have reinactments of the lowering of the Confederate Flag for the last time, the final singing of Dixie and many other commemorative activities.  </p>
<p>With time they will come to hate this holiday more than any other, I think.  Most blacks cannot STAND to even discuss slavery.  &#8220;Was your grandfather a slave?&#8221;  &#8220;Was your great-grandmother a slave?&#8221;  &#8220;Do you know where your white blood comes from?  Slavemaster maybe?&#8221;  are not questions that can be handled by most. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if &#8220;respect&#8221; and &#8220;disrespect&#8221; really mean different things to blacks. Genuine disrespect calls for sincere apology, correction, and apology. Can the author seriously believe that someone is due an apology because every school does not subject its students to mandatory instruction in &#8220;African American history&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Simply put, Juneteenth came about the very same way and for the very same reason bogus Kwanzaa came about.  A black militant pushed for it arguing that Blacks should not celebrate ANY &#8220;white&#8221; holidays and should celebrate only black holidays.  Kwanzaa was to replace Christmas.  Juneteenth was to replace Fourth of July.  Note, also, the typically black ridiculous spelling and phraseology of the holiday.  Just when exactly is Juneteenth?  Nobody knows.  Sounds cool and black, though, don&rsquo;t it?  They wouldn&rsquo;t want to actually say it was June 19th.  Even the illiterate hispanics know the date of cinco de mayo, and what it was for.  </p>

<p>About a third of the American population is German-speaking background (exact figures are hard to come by, since many immigrated from countries other than Germany).  Yet I know of no college which requires a course in German or German-American history.  When we, German Americans) get proper recognition, then we can think about the ten to fifteen percent of Americans who are Black.</p>

		<p>Another piece of foolish history. St Augustine Florida also celebrated Juneteenth. Not one slave in America was freed on Juneteenth. All slaves in the confederate staes were free as of the Emancipation proclamation. There were still over 500,000 slaves in the border states that didn`t join the rebels. Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and the Show Me  State. These folks were not free until the 13 th amendment ratified almost a year later. The Badger State should celebrate that day but of course it would be a panderless holiday.<br>

<p>Half of America&rsquo;s whites are at least one-quarter German in ethnicity.  The proportion of German-Americans is so high in some parts of the country that the strip from west of Philadelphia to about halfway across Missouri is called the Kraut Belt.</p>
<p>In spite of this, German-American history is often handled sloppily, I won&rsquo;t go into examples.  The Post Office refuses to release a German-American stamp series while having almost everything else, including some Muslim Eid stamps a PO clerk tried to stick me with last month.  And almost no public schools, even in the Kraut Belt, offer the German language.  The St. Louis City Public Schools have Bosnian and Swahili, but no German in a heavily but formerly Kraut city.</p>

		<p>The writer &#8220;Montie&#8221;(female, BTW) wonders why there is a scarcity of African writers. Perhaps that&rsquo;s due to the fact that the continent of Africa has produced only one black writer who has much international recognition - Wole Soyinka, of Nigeria. Only two other writers of note were produced by Africa, the race-traitors Alan Paton and Nadine Gordimer, the South African WOTOBOTIs (&#8220;White on the outside, black on the inside&#8221;).</p>
<p>In other words, how can you search for something that really doesn&rsquo;t exist?</p>

		<p>I believe you&rsquo;re right about blacks having a different meaning for &#8220;disrepect.&#8221; So do muslims. To those groups, to &#8220;disrepect&#8221; someone is to treat them like everyone else, i.e. to not put them on a pedestal as something special.</p>
<p>Actually, muslims go further. Instead of being &#8220;disrepected,&#8221; they say they are &#8220;humiliated&#8221; whenever they are not in a superior position.</p>
