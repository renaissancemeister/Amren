<h1>Poll: Obama Still Very Popular Among African-Americans, But &#8216;Thrill Is Gone&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, December 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-Americans are extremely supportive of President Obama, but their enthusiasm appears to have dramatically dropped from earlier this year, according to a new national poll.</p>
<p>The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey, released Tuesday, also indicates that Obama&rsquo;s presidency appears to have made blacks more optimistic about race relations, but less than one in five believe the new president has ushered in a new era of race relations in the country.</p>
<p>More than nine in 10 blacks questioned in the poll approve of the job Obama&rsquo;s doing in the White House, far higher than 42 percent of whites who approve of his performance as president.</p>
<p>But when asked how they personally feel about Obama&rsquo;s presidency, only 42 percent of black respondents say they&rsquo;re thrilled, with nearly half of those questioned saying they are happy but not thrilled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;African-Americans are still big fans of the first black president in U.S. history, but the thrill is gone,&#8221; said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.</p>
<p>According to the poll, 51 percent of African-Americans say Obama&rsquo;s presidency has brought some improvement in race relations in the U.S., but only 18 percent feel it&rsquo;s the start of a new era. Another 23 percent say they&rsquo;ve seen a real change in race relations over the past 11 months and 7 percent say things have gotten worse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites take a dimmer view of Obama&rsquo;s effect on race relations, with a third believing that the new presidency has not changed race relations in the country and 15 percent of whites saying that Obama has made race relations worse,&#8221; Holland added. &#8220;Not surprisingly, whites are less supportive of Obama, although for a notable number of whites, their negative view of the president is due to the perception that he&rsquo;s not been liberal enough.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Quite frankly, I wonder who conducts these polls. It is probably safe to say that most Black people, or at least upscale, educated ones, never believed that Obama was going to be the messiah. They were just happy that one of their own finally made it to the presidency.</p>
<p>It is the White liberal media (and some segments of the conservatvie media) especially the neo-cons. There is not a  dimes worth of difference in either group that has promoted this &#8220;all hail Obama&#8221; rhetoric that many sensible people have not foolishly fallen for. </p>

		<p>By &#8220;race relations&#8221; blacks of course mean what Obama has done to favor blacks, not what he has done to ease tensions between the races.  Hence, they aren&rsquo;t thrilled anymore because Obama has only given them half or less of what he promised them.</p>

		<p>What a surprise that blacks still support Obama enthusiastically, though they seem disappointed  that &#8220;we ain&rsquo;t gittin&rsquo; as much as we deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>They have, as a group, bought into the idea that they&rsquo;re entitled, due to something that may or may not have happened to their ancestors many generations ago.  Their enthusiasm for our dear leader would wane somewhat the moment he suggested that they look to themselves for advancement.</p>

		<p>If I were an African American, I would flat out be ashamed of my so-called leaders. I mean utterly ashamed. The African American leadership believes in amnesty for illegal aliens, despite the fact that millions of blacks are out of work. And Obama is going to lead the charge in this amnesty, supposedly. They still believe in quotas and affirmative action, despite the fact that many of those quotas that should be going to blacks, are now going to ANY &#8220;IMMIGRANT&#8221; THAT COMES TO THE U.S. YESTERDAY. I repeat, any &#8220;IMMIGRANT&#8221; that comes to the U.S. yesterday. NONE, none, of these &#8220;Immigrants&#8221; were ever denied rights like admittedly blacks were, yet black &#8220;leaders&#8221; throw away and cheapen the rights won by blacks during the so-called civil rights era by allowing any immigrant the same rights they fought so bitterly for, according to the &#8220;black leaders&#8221; themselves. Stupid is as stupid does. </p>

<p>Yes, Mitch McConnel is known as Mr. Excitement.  The other Republicans are almost as exciting.</p>
<p>To heck with the Republicans.  Give us a third party.  The Republicans are no more than Democrats light.  No candidate from either party are truly &#8220;from the people,&#8221; and are selected by the political hacks.  </p>

		<p>I agree with Anonymous #3!  And I cannot WAIT for the 2012 elections.  Here&rsquo;s my own personal dream ticket:  Mitt Romney for President (the man knows MONEY, and that&rsquo;s what we need to get us out of this mess!) and Sarah Palin for VP - she&rsquo;s got guts, intelligence, executive experience, and speaks for the common people, not the elite.  At this point I think that combination would be unbeatable.  (and hey, they&rsquo;re both white!)  But a lot can happen between now and then, so we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.  I&rsquo;m PRAYING on this one though.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many blacks will see their jobs taken by Mexicans before blacks realize what Obama is all about. Obama&rsquo;s only goal it the destruction of traditional America through immigration of non whites, the takeover of medical care, penalizing sucess through wealth re=distribution and more and more regulation of American business and industry. Because of his mixed race he has psycological problems that obviously manifest themselves in his <br>
determination to destroy everything uniquely American. I&rsquo;m not surprised blacks like him. His color is their only focus. What does surprise me is how many whites still think he something special because he is cool and gives a good speech. Anyone with an ounce of insight can see he is a self centered amoral egotist, hates America and will stop at nothing to destroy it. If his presidency runs a full term, or God forbid a second, The U.S. will be an overcrowded third world sewer with no common culture. And its halfway there already.</p>

		<p>pardon my lack of capital letters or certain punctuation. i have a broken keyboard. santa didn&rsquo;t get my letter when i wrote him for a new one.</p>
<p>most blacks don&rsquo;t really know how many of the popuation has to be literate and econmics-savvy to create such a miracle and success-beyond-belief nation as the united states. <br>
i would say a majority of them actually believe that the black race actually contributed as much to the success of america as whites.<br>
therefore, when a black was elected president most of them had unrealistic expectations of him - at the very least. i guess most of you have seen the youtube video interview with the black woman spouting the lines&hellip;.&#8221; now i don&rsquo;t have to worry about paying my mortgage. obama will even put gas in my car.&#8221; <br>
i knew that there were blacks out there who were open socialists, but i didn&rsquo;t really think there were that many that would express their ignorance and greed so openly. <br>
now we all know how bad a hurricane it is to have a black in the white house. apparently most of the whites that voted for him had no idea how liberal and reckless obama would be as commander in chief. </p>
<p>i only hope that the november elections in 2010 come before he can grant amnesty to the 25-30 million illegal aliens we now have as resicents and who are draining this country dry of resources, bankrupting hospitals and schools. if amnesty is granted, he will have, in one fell swoop, permanently changed - for the worse - the culture and fabric of this country. with the recent liberal legislation called the &#8221;family reunification act&#8221;, they may call in their relatives which could increase our spanish-speaking amigos to around 100 million. conservatives would therefore never again have a chance at balance or have a conservative viewpoint from that point forward. we will have ipso facto surrendered the country to mexico. america will go bankrupt as a nation sooner than i expected. </p>
<p>all of this so we could have a black president. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe and have never believed that Obama was as smart and intelligent as everybody was saying.  He is the first Affirmative Action president, put into office by a bunch of gimme gimme gimmes and liberal, groveling, white people.  Compare him to any other government employee.  No experience, placed in the highest office in the country simply because of the color of his skin.</p>
<p>I have always hated affirmative action and Obama is the end result.</p>
<p>And if blacks are disenchanted with him, it&rsquo;s only because he didn&rsquo;t dole out thost billions of stimulus dollars directly to them.  It still went to the same people who created the financial mess we are in.</p>

		<p>I think that Obama is the second black president.  Didn&rsquo;t the political pundits, talking heads, and other elites always claim that Bill Clinton was the first black president? I remember when he announced that White Americans were no longer in the majority in this country.  It looked as though he was having an orgasim when he made that statement.  Most of these White elites in power hate the average White American with a vengence(especially White males).  Anyway, in my books, Clinton was the first black president.  If you don&rsquo;t think Hilary doesn&rsquo;t hold the same viewpoint, than you haven&rsquo;t been listening.</p>

<p>That is probably one of the most laughably odd things that I have ever read, and that is saying a lot in these multicultural times. CNN has sunk to a new low on the stupidity graph, there is no denying it. Since when are blacks ever &ldquo;thrilled&rdquo; with anything, except for when they are raping and pillaging from &ldquo;wicked ol&rsquo; whitey?&rdquo; And so there is Comrade BO&rsquo;s real problem with &ldquo;his people;&rdquo; until he signs into law an open season on &ldquo;wicked ol&rsquo; whitey,&rdquo; or can figure out how to make them all white, they will never be truly happy with him. </p>
<p>Next, is this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holland added. &lsquo;Not surprisingly, whites are less supportive of Obama, although for a notable number of whites, their negative view of the president is due to the perception that he&rsquo;s not been liberal enough.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another bazaar of the bizarre!</p>
<p>One assumes that these latter &ldquo;whites&rdquo; described above, are the sort of mindless vegetables who are despondently displeased with Comrade BO, because he has not &ldquo;magically&rdquo; transformed them into individuals &ldquo;of color.&rdquo; </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEQ5dWQcjJg" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEQ5dWQcjJg</a></p>
<p>Well, I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when you think that the film &ldquo;Watermelon Man&rdquo; was a civil rights documentary. </p>

		<p>To EEuro, regarding: </p>
<p>&ldquo;America may be the biggest paradox in history, who can explain this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is one simple and utterly maddening, explanation to all of this; it is one word, Multiculturalism!</p>
<p>You mention Russia, but they only adopted an insane socioeconomic philosophy and put it into practice. Indeed, it godlessly required and facilitated millions of deaths, but it never really reached the level of derangement that required and facilitated a genocide of an entire race of people. Classes of people yes, but that was its particular bete noir.   </p>
<p>No, the genocide of &ldquo;races,&ldquo; it took the Nazis to come up with that link in the totalitarian quest for &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; in the great chain of &ldquo;Socialism.&rdquo; And so, Auschwitz and Treblinka became synonymous with corpse manufacturing. </p>
<p>Put the two together, add a dash of Islam apology manna and a splash of white guilt sari  sauce, and there you have it, Multiculturalism Flambé with white meat exclusively in the twisted concoction.</p>
<p>Bon Appétit!</p>
<p>All the best to you Eeuro,</p>

<p>My sentiments exactly, and you might be interested to know one of the most accurate trends forecasters in the country, Gerald Celente, has advised Americans to do EXACTLY as you are doing, because &#8220;this powderkeg is ready to explode.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is forecasting that out of the ashes shall come a rebirth like the Renaissance, and people should be improving themselves right now.  The man has been far too stunningly accurate for 30 years to ignore.  He has a staff of 25 experts that look at 300 different variables every day and tracks their importance and influence in determining the most likely scenario to occur.</p>
<p>If only the US government was as competent we wouldn&rsquo;t be in the fix we are in right now.</p>
