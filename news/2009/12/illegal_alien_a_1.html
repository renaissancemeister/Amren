			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner (Virginia), December 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Wednesday, police in Slidell, LA, arrested an illegal alien for slashing the throat of his 84-year-old neighbor with a razor blade. The attack left an 8-inch gash in the woman&rsquo;s throat, her assailant stole about $65 in cash.</p>
<p>The octogenarian victim survived the attack and later identified the man who did odd jobs for her, Ricardo Tenorio-Palma, 20, as the man who tried to kill her.</p>
<p>Slidell Police Capt. Kevin Swann said: &#8220;It wasn&rsquo;t like he demanded money; he stabbed her first. He slashed her first, before he robbed her. He intended to kill her,&#8221;</p>
<p>Police allege that on Wednesday afternoon, Tenorio-Palma entered the woman&rsquo;s home through a door she always left slightly open for her cat.</p>
<p>Punching and kicking, the woman fought off her attacker until the loss of blood and fatigue set in. Left bleeding on the floor, the woman then activated her medical alert necklace.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The victim recently paid the Mexican national to string-up Christmas lights on her house, and in the past, had given him furniture and other household items.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tenorio-Palma sits in St. Tammany Jail, and has been charged with attempted first-degree murder and armed robbery. If convicted, he faces a possible sentence of up to 99 years in prison.<br>

		<p>30 years ago a kid in the neighborhood would have put up her lights. </p>
<p>Just as we have suffered for generations from the terrible decision to bring blacks here as slaves, we&rsquo;re now suffering from the terrible decision to bring up mexicans as serfs.</p>
<p>Until we whites learn that the path to wealth and a healthy society is not by importing inferiors who hate us and are just waiting to get one over on us, we seem to be doomed to repeat these scenarios. </p>

		<p>This is the sort of thing that the san Francisco City Council condones - they support hiding criminal illegal aliens who are under age.  I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re prosecuting this pig in Slidell - I wish we could outlaw &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; cities and prosecute the city councils who voted in such status.</p>

		<p>Bringing these underclass individuals into one&rsquo;s house or even yard is like bringing home a jungle-bred tiger from the zoo.  You never know when it will turn feral and attack.</p>

		<p>Why on earth are people bringing up San Francisco here?  This happened in a small town in Louisiana.  This is an example of the delusional mentality that many conservatives, especially Southerners, who claim to be pro-white have.  They can&rsquo;t accept the fact that conservatives and &#8220;red states&#8221; are almost as bad on racial and immigration issues as liberals and &#8220;blue states&#8221; are, so they constantly bring up irrelevant things like how San Francisco treats illegal aliens when the topic is illegal aliens who are tolerated living small towns in the South and employed by the local white people.</p>

		<p>Joe is right.  The poor women was brainwashed into thinking it was the &#8220;christian&#8221; thing to do and the right thing to do - allow an unknown alien third world illegal to do odd jobs for her.  What she should have done was have no truck with him, and have a big dog she could sic on suspicious looking people who approached her.  &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; are just as bad as liberals regarding illegal immigration because they are gutless pansies who quake at the mere mention that they might be &#8220;racist&#8221;.<br>
The icon of &#8220;conservatives&#8221; Ronald Reagan approved amnesty for illegals we must remember.  I wonder sometimes if liberals and others have finally recognized the black is untrustworthy, ungrateful, and often violent thus won&rsquo;t hire them for menial labor around the house - and think illegal hispanics are different, which they aren&rsquo;t, so want this cheap labor as replacements for blacks for these jobs.  They are learning that the hispanic is just as bad.  Maybe worse, because there is no subliminal fear of hurting whites left from older times when fear of the rope kept blacks in check.  </p>
