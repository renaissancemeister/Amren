<h1>White Tailbacks out of the Running</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phil Taylor, Sports Illustrated, November 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>(Editor&rsquo;s note: This story appeared in the Nov. 30, 2009, issue of Sports Illustrated. The statistics have since been updated.)</p>
<p>They will usually accept the backhanded compliments without complaint: &#8220;Hey, you&rsquo;re pretty fast for a white dude.&#8221; They will smile when they get tagged with a nickname like Eminem or K-Fed. (Get it? They&rsquo;re Caucasian guys trying to do what African-Americans tend to do better.) White running backs will take all the good-natured teasing you&rsquo;ve got, and they&rsquo;ll ask for only one thing in return  &mdash;  the football.</p>
<p>{snip} You&rsquo;re more likely to see Bill Belichick dance the hokeypokey on the sideline than find a white tailback in the NFL. There isn&rsquo;t a single white feature back on any of the 32 teams; the Bengals&rsquo; Brian Leonard leads all white rushers in carries, with 25 (for 67 yards). White running backs break through slightly more often on the college level, where Stanford&rsquo;s Toby Gerhart leads in the nation in rushing  &mdash;  but there is only one other white back, Nevada&rsquo;s Luke Lippincott, among the top 50 ground-gainers. Of the BCS teams Stanford is the only one whose primary running back is white.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re thinking that the racial imbalance is because Caucasian backs just can&rsquo;t keep up. You watch Adrian Peterson and Maurice Jones-Drew and say, &#8220;Find me a white runner who can do that.&#8221; But there&rsquo;s plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that white backs haven&rsquo;t been competing just against other players; they&rsquo;ve also been battling the perception that they&rsquo;re not cut out for the job. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For those who do reach the NFL, the path doesn&rsquo;t get any easier. In 2003 Brock Forsey was a Bears backup who started one game in place of injured starter Anthony Thomas and was spectacular, rushing for 134 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. The next week Thomas returned to the lineup and Forsey went back to the bench, getting only three carries. He never started another NFL game. &#8220;It&rsquo;s hard to tell exactly what happened,&#8221; says Forsey, who starred at Boise State and is now an executive at a title and escrow company in Nampa, Idaho. &#8220;No one ever said anything about race. But there may be some preconceived notions out there. A white guy from Idaho isn&rsquo;t what you have in mind when you envision an NFL running back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evaluating players shouldn&rsquo;t be about what we envision but what we see. That lesson should have been learned from the decades of discrimination against black quarterbacks at colleges and in the pros. Despite the obvious parallels, no one seems to be as concerned that white tailbacks are getting the same treatment. &#8220;I did dozens of interviews about the lack of opportunity for an African-American to be a QB back in the 1980s and early &rsquo;90s,&#8221; says Richard Lapchick, director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at Central Florida, &#8220;but this is only the second time I have been asked about the lack of opportunity for whites to be running backs.&#8221; Maybe that&rsquo;s because racism isn&rsquo;t the culprit here; it&rsquo;s mostly white coaches and talent evaluators who are choosing black running backs over white ones. But it doesn&rsquo;t make the color line any less real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that football needs to aim for some acceptable distribution of races throughout the field, and it&rsquo;s not that every white would-be tailback who is passed over or directed to a different position is the victim of stereotyping. It&rsquo;s about equality of opportunity, just as it has always been. The sports world may be enlightened enough not to immediately dismiss the idea of African-Americans as quarterbacks or coaches anymore, but maybe we haven&rsquo;t come as far as we thought. Maybe we&rsquo;ve just found a new demographic to discourage. {snip}<br>

		<p>This article is from Caste Football, right?  We&rsquo;re making progress if any given SI writer channels Don Wassall.</p>
<p>As for the subject matter, one does not necessarily have the fastest foot speed (re: black) to be a good running back.  A slower white can be a good running back if he has the intellect to avoid impeulence and impatience when he gets the ball, and in a pinch, ops for pounding through the D-linemen to gain five to run around hoping to run straight for the endzone but very likely getting bounced for a loss.  Black RBs tend to rack up the yardage because once they&rsquo;re out in the open field, they have a better chance to outrun the secondary because of pure speed, usually the safeties because the cornerbacks were too busy defending the wideouts.  All that means is that they rack up yardage.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care if 100% of the players were black, the sports crazy White boys will still support &#8220;their&#8221; teams. I have never understood the mentality of Whites that cheer for the openly  racist black thugs that make up a sizable portion of players today. These same people would NEVER have anything to do with these thugs in any other setting and would be horrified if their daughters dated them, but they LIVE for the next game to cheer them on. I can&rsquo;t figure it out, can anyone enlighten me. </p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m only sorry that this glaring, inconvenient truth about the NFL had to be pointed out by a black columnist   &mdash;   not a White one. But if a White columnist had written it, he&rsquo;d probably be accused of &hellip; well, something derogatory; fill in the blank. Taylor is right, though; it just doesn&rsquo;t stand to reason that every single black athlete is better at a given position   &mdash;   say, tailback   &mdash;   than every White one.</p>

		<p>The NFL is pretty bad in terms of anti-white discrimination. In all the big high schools football states the championships are usually won by all-white or mostly white teams. Caste Football had an article about a Texas high school state championship game a few years ago that had an all-white team against an all-black team for the title. The all-white team crushed them but only 2-3 players on the winning white team had offers to Division I colleges. Meanwhile, the inferior black team had 10-11 players getting free rides to major colleges.</p>
<p>They used to say that blacks are just superior in boxing. Yet now, about 15 of the 20 champions from heavyweight to middleweight are white.</p>
<p>The NBA is still basically a black supremacist operation. Yet in international competition, all-black teams from the U.S. are routinely beaten by all-white teams from Europe.</p>
<p>The problem is, almost all the coaches and scouts believe blacks are superior athletes. So even if they see a white athlete outperform a black they will give the roster spot to the black.</p>
<p>Individual sports are fairer. A coach or judge might think a black boxer is superior to a white. But if the black ends up in the prone position it is hard to still give him the win.</p>
<p>I used to love pro football and still follow college a bit (most of the top teams outside the South are about half white). But the NFL is simply racist and I will not support them anymore. When whites (and other non-blacks) are treated fairly then I may start buying tickets again.</p>
<p>Toby Gerhart is the best running back in college football right now but will be moved to full back in the NFL (meaning he will essentially be a blocker for a slower, smaller, inferior running back who has the proper pigmentation).</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s because whites lack any racially unified voice.</p>
<p>If there were ZERO black QBs and the ONE black QB in the league came in for an injured white starter and threw for 350 yards and 4 TDs and then was immediately benched and never allowed another opportunity to play again there would not only be outrage from the black community, political activists and media pundits - there would be a story about the guy 10 years after he retired produced by Hollywood.</p>
<p>But a white guy is in a league with no other white tailbacks, is given a chance due to a black starter and rushes for 134 yards and a TD - astounding for a starter, never mind a backup - and is rewarded with not just being benched the next game - but never having a chance to start the rest of his career!  And no one makes a peep.</p>
<p>Lack of racial unity is what wasted his talent.  </p>
<p>And just because the coaches are white means they cannot buy in to a racial caste system?  Pffft, please.</p>

		<p>Actually, whites now hold 18 of the 21 belts from 154 lbs to heavyweight. From 147 on down, most of the champs are latino and a few whites. Black heavyweights are taking such a pounding that they are considered &hellip; jokes!  And the white fighters are from all over Europe (plus Kelly Pavlik from the US, etc). The Slavs dominate the heavyweights. The Marxist controlled media is so upset they hardly show any boxing at all. The UFC has been forced to ignore white fighters, in order to have more &#8216;darker&rsquo; fighters in their stables, all because the networks told them - to paraphrase it - they wouldn&rsquo;t cut a deal unless there were non-white champs. </p>
<p>People need to look at the full results of the NFL combines. I mean the FULL results. The blacks dominate the 40 yd sprint, but not near as much as the media would have you think. Plenty of fast whites over 40 yards because they tend to get off the line faster. The whites thrash blacks in the shuttle run but it&rsquo;s never shown on TV. Strength? Well, we all know whites have better physical strength on average, especially in the upper body. You get the idea. The NFL used to televise the &#8220;Fastest Man in the NFL&#8221; contest along with the &#8220;Strongest Man in the NFL&#8221; contest. They dumped the strength contest because blacks were unable to compete against the whites, even they were the vast majority of the players. The networks and the NFL didn&rsquo;t want to show blacks being beaten. Disgusting. </p>

<p>And what about boxers like Rocky Marciano, or the new wave of excellent professionnal boxers from Russia and other countries form eastern Europe? One of them, litterally a giant, kicked the butt of Evander Hollifield pretty bad, a few months ago!</p>
<p>Boxing used to be a sport dominated, in America, by the Irish, the Italians, and the Jews of different geographical origins. There used to be a saying, &#8220;if times are good, we&rsquo;ll have a Black heavyweight champoin, but if times are bad, we&rsquo;ll have a White champion&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe White athletes have lost interest in boxing, while for some Black athletes, it became a way out of the ghetto.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe for a second this nonsense about Black physical superiority.</p>
<p>There are some who say they have more quick twitch muscle fibers in their muscles&hellip; without having any scientifically valid evidence to offer (how convenient!)&hellip;</p>
<p>And what if this whole &#8220;Black superiority&#8221; thing was the result of a well thought, well orchestrated scheme, conducted through lots of chances being given to Blacks (unfairly) at the expense of White athletes, and with the mainstrean media very often depicting Balcks athletes as Supermen?</p>

		<p>Below are 40 yard times for Running Backs, Tight Ends and Offensive Tackles, taken from Rivals.com for 2007. This is a scouting site for high school football players.  Heights, weights, and 40 yard times are given for each player, and pictures shown, but not all listings have pictures.  I have not done a similar analysis since.</p>
<p>I have listed the top thirty in times for each category.<br>
Running Backs<br>
What you will see is that among the running backs, Blacks are faster, but there are a number of white running backs within the top speeds. What was interesting is that all of the Black running backs in the top 30 speeds were given stars but none of the Whites were. </p>
<p>Tight Ends<br>
Here the picture changes. There are as many if not slightly more White TE&rsquo;s.  Note that there are more that did not submit a picture.</p>
<p>Offensive Tackles<br>
Here the picture shows even more fast tight Whites in this group.</p>
<p>Summary<br>
The picture you get from this is that there are more running Black running backs with speed, but there are some Whites with requisite speed, but they do not get any stars for ranking.</p>
<p>In the offensive positions requiring both speed and size, there are far more Whites (but this does not show up in the college lineups, or in the pros. Tight ends slight excepted for pros.)</p>

<p>My high school track coach refused to let whites run the 100, 200 and 400. He threw a rant at me for just asking to try out. I ended up running the 800 and did pretty good. But I should have run the 400. fyi- the coach was white.</p>

<p> - - As a long time football fan (I&rsquo;m not really a fan any longer)I lived and died with my football team.  As the 1980&rsquo;s ended and we entered the &#8216;90&rsquo;s my team had very few White players.  Today that is also true. I found myself drifting away from sports but at the time I didn&rsquo;t identify the reason.  I can identify the reason now.  It is because of the players.  There are extremely few White players.  I could identify with the players of old because they were not the criminal low lifes that play professional sports in the USA today.  So I don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s backside who does what.  Sports are an alien venue to me now.  But you want to know why so many Whites frequent major sports today, even with the Black trash that play them.  The reason is the vast majority of White people have lost what little racial consciousness they had due to media conditioning.  I also believe that White people are so afraid of appearing racist that they must prove that they&rsquo;re not - at least in their own minds - by cheering for a team even though the team is mostly all Black.  I think many White people think that they&rsquo;re showing how &#8220;accepting&#8221; they are of Blacks.  Also Tom it&rsquo;s hard to &#8220;leave&#8221; the team that you rooted for for so many years, from your childhood to your adulthood.  It&rsquo;s very difficult.  I have done it.  I have racial consciousness.  I believe that if/when we see the day that Whites no longer frequent Baseball, Football and Basketball games anymore, that will be the turning point for our race.  We will be racially conscious again.</p>

		<p>I read this column (last page of SI) last week.  Same info as what you&rsquo;d find on caste football; but written by a respected black sportswriter.  Kudos to SI for printing this.</p>
<p>All you sports haters &amp; boycotters, why not consider who created all these big $ sports?  Certainly none were created by blacks.  Sports have been a part of America since its beginnings.  E.g., Andrew Jackson was a famous sportsman &amp; sports lover.  Read some pre-PC history books, please.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s apply the multicultural social diversity model to sports:  every team must field players in proportion to their racial amount in society.  Isn&rsquo;t that equity and social justice?  Because whites are about 60% of the population now, all sports must have 60% white players.  You must also have your cirrect proportion of hispanics on every football and basketball team.  Hockey is just too darned white!  40% of the players must be Asian, Latino and Black, in correct proportions, of course.</p>
<p>Maybe we should strive for gender equality in this lucrative line of work.  55% of all players must also be female.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, if you were to present this model to the social justice and diversity people, they would object (because minorities would see their share of this pie plummet), but when it comes to any other sphere of life, they bemoan the lack of proportional representation of minorities elsewhere.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy is a hard thing to see and a harder thing to admit.</p>

		<p>6) &#8220;The UFC has been forced to ignore white fighters, in order to have more &lsquo;darker&rsquo; fighters in their stables, all because the networks told them - to paraphrase it - they wouldn&rsquo;t cut a deal unless there were non-white champs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really?  This would make sense, I noticed for a while there that nearly every single champion was white.  Then suddenly out of nowhere there were blacks/mestizos/etc that were becoming champions.</p>
<p>I can understand a samoan or two being a champion, but the way all the non-whites suddenly popped up was simply&hellip; strange.</p>
<p>Can you link to an article that proves this?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve posted comments similar to #12 before. What do a bunch of overpaid, undereducated thugs playing a ball game have to do with civic pride? I don&rsquo;t watch professional sports anymore, and will walk out of the room anytime the discussion turns to the football team at my college.</p>
<p>My only contact with blacks there has involved territorial disputes with football players who share my classroom for team meetings. Am yet to meet one that comes across as smart enough to be a real student! The deepest thoughts that run through their heads seem to involve strategies for being as obnoxious as possible to the White Professor.</p>

		<p>7 Francois:</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I read a story about how the return of boxing as a school sport in England has been beneficial for those who box.  I think the reason is that those who take it up get to work out all their aggression between the ropes and therefore don&rsquo;t have any left for the rest of the day.  Boxing is structured violence.</p>
<p>But I noted to myself when I read it that boxing, at least in a participatory sense, has never been popular with the middle and upper classes of white people.  I think that boxing symbolizes the otherwise rough and unsteady lives of the boys and men who box.  The son of a corporate middle manager never has any real struggles in his life, and therefore doesn&rsquo;t have the mental moxie, the stick-to-it-iveness or the adrenaline to succeed in boxing.  For all his faults, Mike Tyson was a great fighter because that&rsquo;s all he had going for him; life sucked otherwise.  He was either going to win fights, or pick waste with the chickens.  Ethnic whites, such as Italian-, Irish- and Jewish- (though the great Jewish boxers were mostly mixed with another white ethnicity), during the days of enshrined WASPey/Brahminey bigotry, i.e. &ldquo;No Irish/Italians/Jews Need Apply,&rdquo; in the time they were ghettoized, also made great boxers during those years.  Everyone knows about Rocky Marciano, and any decent boxing fan can rattle off the name of a dozen great Irish-American boxers from the old days in a New York Minute.</p>
<p>If American high schools bought back boxing, and money was not an issue, it would be mainly black and Hispanic schools that would start most of the boxing programs.  Then again, almost all high schools and some others have football, which, at least on the scholastic level, is non-existent in most of the rest of the world, and football is the same kind of structured violence.</p>

		<p>I used to think blacks were better athletes than whites, until I started putting 2 and 2 together. Once during a NFL superbowl game, I saw a white player outrun three black players from the opposing team and score a touchdown, and he must&rsquo;ve run at least 40 yrds to achieve this accomplishment. During the 1970s, I remember Larry Csonka from the Miami Dolphins and another white player from the Washington Redskins who were both running backs, both whom were outstanding players. I also remember during one of the summer Olympic games, a basketball game, the US team, which was comprised of some of the best players from the NBA, (all black) was playing a European team, (all white) and the Euros easily beat them without breaking much of a sweat. And I actually found myself rooting for the European team and am glad they won.<br>
This article is a good example of reverse discrimnation in professional sports. If whites were smart about this, they would boycott both the NFL and the NBA and not attend any of these games and demand at least 50% or more white players in the starting lineups. Even baseball seems to be going the way of becoming black. <br>
Brock Forsey from the Bears should&rsquo;ve sued the NFL for reverse discrimnation. </p>

		<p>The remark about the UFC ignoring white guys to try and darken their champs is true. CBS started their own organization because the UFC, which they were trying to create a deal with, was too white, even though Dana White and his cohorts were setting things up to make sure they had a more non-whites at the top of their rankings. CBS started having their fight shows and their big gun was Kimbo Slice, a black guy with some boxing training who made his name beating up smaller, untrained opponents. It all unraveled when Kimbo fought a smaller but trained white kid who knocked Kimbo out in less than 30 seconds. Later it was revealed CBS had told the white fighter to not take Kimbo to the ground (the weakest part of most black fighters&rsquo; game in MMA is ground fighting / grappling). So the kid belted Kimbo in the jaw and Kimbo dropped like a sack of hammers. So did CBS&rsquo; organization. They had to pull the pin on it. Now the UFC has picked up Kimbo and is trying to rehabilitate his rep and career. He&rsquo;s already been clobbered by an overweight out of shape white guy. Word is Dana White and the Fertittas (co-owners of the UFC) have been very careful to avoid getting good white fighters in certain divisions (185 lbs, 205 lbs and &#8216;heavyweight&rsquo;) in order to protect one highly overrated black fighter and to increase the number of black and latino fighters. I have no doubt at all this is true. American TV virtually ignores boxing unless they can parade non-white fighters. They simply cannot bear to show all the white champs. The people running the media are gnashing their teeth and trying to apply all kinds of financial pressure to change this horrible situation. </p>

<p>You wrote: &#8220;I read a story about how the return of boxing as a school sport in England has been beneficial for those who box&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a middle class guy, and I did Kung Fu and kick-boxing as a teen and as a young adult. Such disciplines, with their trainig methods, strenghten the body and they also teach disciplin, humility, and a good competitive attitude.</p>
<p>What you say about boxing being associated with rough and unsteady lives is probably true&hellip; for today&rsquo;s America. I mean, decades ago, many students at Oxford University, England, boxed.<br>
Probably because in those days, Britain was stilla great nation, rather than the multicultural mess is is today. And the British understood that although it was important to gain knowledge, you also had to develop character, and be able to look after yourself, to be a complete man.</p>
<p>And there is something else: if more and more talented Whites took up boxing, Blacks and latinos would learn the hard way, that when you face another man in a ring, there&rsquo;s no affirmative action there!</p>

		<p>Tom S asks why white men are so in love with sports, given that most teams are populated with black thugs who hate whites.</p>
<p>I struggle to understand it myself, though I am torn about sports as a good or bad things for whites.  Obviously, whites like to PLAY sports because it&rsquo;s physical and quasi-military, which is a good thing.  Playing fields of Eton and all that.  On the other hand, endless obsession with pro sports has many downsides:  it&rsquo;s couch-riding, artery-clogging inactivity that also wastes mental energy.  Like the Bread and Circuses, sports divert whites from the BIGGER game, which they&rsquo;re losing BADLY, of course.  I personally get very annoyed at all these normal, somewhat intelligent white males talking non-stop about sports, but never about race or politics.  They can give you any statistic, they can talk for hours about teams, players, coaches, managers, strategies, you name it.  Yawn.  To me it&rsquo;s about as interesting as stamp collecting or flower arranging.  I&rsquo;m not going to be an anti-sports prude, but please.  </p>

		<p>Please take note that Alabama and Bear Bryant won 6 national titles with all white ball clubs in the 1960s, before Alabama integrated, and the Big Ten and Pac-10 had integrated. Think about THAT!I think the problem is coaches totally relying on 40 yard dash times, and not heart &amp; strength &amp; determination.</p>

		<p> Watching the Chicago Bears play I really noticed all the blacks on the starting team. The offensive unit had  only two whites and the defensive unit had no whites. No whites!  Who could root for a team like that. I can&rsquo;t identify with them, nor would I want to. Also college football, there are a lot more blacks on the teams than whites. Who wants black athletes representing your state colleges.I&rsquo;d like to go back in time when teams were 100% white.</p>
