			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luke Funk, WNYW-TV (New York), December 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Port Authority police officers had to help control an angry crowd at the Delta Air Lines terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The PA says the police had to help maintain order and help customer service representatives that bore the brunt of the anger.</p>
<p>Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman told Fox 5 that it took less than an hour to get things completely under control.</p>
<p>The weekend snowstorm has left many people stranded in New York.  Some people had flights rescheduled days later than their original itinerary, forcing them to miss cruises and other vacations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Newsday cited a source as saying the problems started when a flight to Haiti was overbooked.</p>

						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The episode occurred Tuesday morning when passengers  &mdash;  who had already been waiting two days to be put on a flight to Haiti, after their initial plane was grounded by the snowstorm  &mdash;  were told that the flight was overbooked and that they would have to wait another day. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The airline said it had added a second flight to Haiti on Wednesday to accommodate the remaining passengers, who have been provided with meals and lodging since the initial flight was canceled Sunday, Ms. Elliott [Susan Elliott, a spokeswoman for Delta Air Lines] said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} While there were no other reported scenes of passenger uprisings, the frustration was widely shared.</p>

		<p>I am on vacation myself and just flew out of JFK on Sunday!</p>
<p>I came within minutes of missing my flight largely thanks to two large agitated hispanic families who were waived directly in front of me in the security line. The airline employee told me that &#8220;their flight was boading&#8221; so they were being waived in front of everyone. </p>
<p>I loudly protested and explained to them I had been waiting in line for half an hour and was about to miss my own flight. They told me I should stop complaining since I was &#8220;almost at the front of the line&#8221; and I should just wait patiently. When I finally got to the security screeners, they rewarded my outburst by pulling me aside and pawing through my carry on bag.</p>
<p>Airlines know that whites will never cause trouble but when the minorities get in a frenzy treat them like royalty or there will be a riot.</p>

		<p>I am almost speechless in the sense that any comment I could make about the behavior of blacks under stress would be a rehash of what we all know.  One can only imagine what could have happened had they been real peasants who felt wronged for racial reasons.  What would have happened had they not been given food, lodging and other &#8221;freebies&#8221; to assuage their anger?  More proof that blacks are incapable of behaving like mature adults in a civilized society.</p>

<p>Strangely though, in an airport full of people, other just-as-frustrated passengers conducted themselves like adults and displayed maturity in the face of hardship. Hmmm&hellip;the police were only summoned to control one particular group. </p>
<p>Worse still, they were provided overnight lodging. Wonderful&hellip;nine months from now my tax dollars will be supporting even more fatherless children. </p>

		<p>Let me get this straight&hellip;they were angry because their flight to Haiti was DELAYED???</p>
<p>I would have kissed the ground and the feet of the airport personnel for having a few more hours in civilization before returning to that miserable, fetid pesthole.</p>

		<p>I was there and it was a zoo. Stuck at JFK, I arrived at the Delta terminal on Monday morning (following two flight cancellations) to find a third world pandemonium. As expected, all the whites trying to get to places like Salt Lake and Kansas were calm, orderly and polite. Unfortunately, we were outnumbered by all the black and brown peoples who jumped lines, shouted, pushed, and shoved their way through the mess.    </p>

		<p>The real question people should be asking is how these people, from such an incredibly poor country, can afford a flight that is many years worth of the typical wage in haiti.</p>

		<p>Hopefully these troublesome Haitians all held one-way tickets home.  If so, the extra accommodation made them in this instance was well worth the trouble.</p>

		<p>The fact that airlines treat Whites and minorities differently is grounds for a lawsuit. If I am made to hunker down overnight in an airline terminal without any comps, then why are the airlines catering to blacks when there is even a minor inconvenience?</p>

		<p>Why would a bunch of Icelanders be upset over an overbooked flight to Haiti? (sarcasm on)</p>
<p>Seriously, beserk Haitians can cause more damage than a North Korean Taepdong missle.</p>

		<p>I hate travelling at JFK and fortunitly in two weeks that will be my last time ever going through the security there.  It&rsquo;s amazing and worrisome to see high school drop outs doing security checks and being generally rude about the whole thing.  I am also amazed that I didn&rsquo;t hear anything about this incident in the papers or on the news.</p>

		<p>I travel regularly (about three times a year) between Newark, NJ and various airports in Britain. At each end of my trip, I find airport security peopled by the same kind of individuals shouting to each other in in Urdu, Punjabi, or whatever the they speak. Airport security is a joke. Tightened security seems to mean that they ask you the same questions twice instead of once. The questioners appear to be minimum-wage employees (in both countries) who probably don&rsquo;t have green cards.<br>
I predict (and I hope I&rsquo;m wrong) another airport terrorist attack in the near future.<br>
I also occasionally fly to Quebec City. Guess how polite the passengers are? Ils sont toujours personnes aimiables et civilises. (Airport security personnel are the same ragtag bunch  &mdash;  at the U.S. end, not in Quebec). </p>

<p>Apparently, this was a way of buying them off from causing any further ruckus.   Formerly, before 9/11, airlines were much more generous in providing such things as meals and lodging.  But after 9/11, they clamped down and got very stingy.  I&rsquo;ve had that experience and was told that the airline would accept responsibility ONLY for things that were the airline&rsquo;s own fault &hellip;  but they would not accept responsibility for Acts of God which were beyond their control, like the weather.  In that case, you&rsquo;re on your own. </p>
<p>And that is correct, according to their legal requirements. But a lot is left to their own discretion.  Sometimes they&rsquo;ll comp you and sometimes they won&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s just easier to pay some people and get them off your neck.  It&rsquo;s cheaper than a riot.</p>
