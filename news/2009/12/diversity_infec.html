<h1>Diversity Infects Medical School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>George Leef, John William Pope Center, December 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Medicine is a field where wrong answers can have really, really serious consequences so you&rsquo;d think that medical schools would shun the diversity obsession and focus entirely on individual competence. Unfortunately, at least one medical school, Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City has succumbed and now has a three-person Office of Faculty Diversity.</p>
<p>The Chronicle of Higher Education recently ran a softball piece on this new &#8220;diversity&#8221; initiative.</p>
<p>What is the justification for this office, which undoubtedly uses several hundred thousand dollars of tuition money annually? According to Dr. Debra Leonard, the Chief Diversity Officer, it is to &#8220;change the Weill Cornell environment to a diverse and inclusive community, so all people feel welcomed, accepted, and part of the team.&#8221;</p>
<p>A good follow-up question would have been, &#8220;Is there any evidence that the faculty of Weill Cornell as currently constituted makes some people feel that they are not welcomed, accepted, or part of the team?&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Apparently, no such skeptical questions were asked. You have to wonder, though, how often it happens that medical professionals in one of the world&rsquo;s most cosmopolitan cities make people feel unwelcome simply because they&rsquo;re from a different background.</p>
<p>The main rationale Dr. Leonard gives for her office is that American medical schools need to &#8220;model diversity&#8221; but aren&rsquo;t doing a good enough job of that because black and Hispanic professors comprise only three and four percent respectively of the faculties at American medical schools, less than the percentages of those groups in the general population.</p>
<p>{snip} It has become an article of faith among many academics that institutions are necessarily better if they &#8220;model diversity,&#8221; but that&rsquo;s all it is  &mdash;  an article of faith. Is there any reason to believe that Weill Cornell will do a better job of training doctors if, say, the next ten faculty members it hires are from &#8220;varied&#8221; backgrounds?</p>
<p>Suppose, hypothetically, that Weill Cornell were choosing between Dr. Miguel Perez, whose parents escaped from Cuba and Dr. Semyon Markov, whose parents escaped from the Soviet Union. Assume that both are fine practitioners. Is it certain that the faculty would be better if Dr. Perez were hired simply because his ancestry puts him in a &#8220;diverse&#8221; category while Dr. Markov&rsquo;s does not? {snip}</p>
<p>A related rationale for pursuing &#8220;diversity&#8221; mentioned in the article is the need to have doctors who are &#8220;culturally competent.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>In rare instances, that&rsquo;s true, but how does that fact justify hiring preferences in favor of medical school faculty who come from &#8220;varied backgrounds&#8221;?</p>
<p>The assumption here is that a doctor who comes from a &#8220;minority&#8221; background knows about the cultural peculiarities of &#8220;his&#8221; people and will be able to more effectively teach doctors in training how do handle challenging patients. But the assumption that a med school professor who is black or Hispanic knows about the cultural peculiarities of black and Hispanic patients is unfounded. It&rsquo;s like assuming that every black person is good at basketball or every Hispanic is a devout Catholic.</p>
<p>Remember Bill Cosby&rsquo;s TV character Dr. Huxtable? He was an upper middle-class black doctor in Philadelphia. If he had found himself with a patient from, say, the Gullah-speaking region of South Carolina, would he have been better at dealing with the cultural (and probably language) difficulties than a white doctor? No reason to think so.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not all possible cultural barriers in medicine have to do with racial minorities. A white doctor (my Dr. Markov, for example) would have just as much trouble dealing with a white patient from Appalachia who has a strong, religiously-based aversion to medicines and surgery as Dr. Huxtable would.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably impossible to teach future doctors about every possible situation they might encounter where &#8220;cultural competence&#8221; would matter, and trying to do so would soak up a lot of time better spent studying medicine. And more importantly, there is no basis for thinking that whatever lessons can be usefully imparted in med school can only be taught if the faculty &#8220;models diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a field like medicine where there can be serious repercussions from bad decisions, it&rsquo;s important to select professionals, professors and students alike, on the basis of individual ability rather than group membership or ancestry. {snip}<br>

		<p>for DECADES now, us med schoold have already made serious efforts to recruit minority students, but nothing has worked becaus of the low average IQs of hispanics and especially blacks.</p>
<p>you cannot conjure qualified indivials from thin air, only accept students not bright enough for medicine, with predictable results.</p>
<p>ask your senator, ask the director of your local college, hospital, bank, ask your mayor, ask your favorite rich person:<br>
do YOU have a black physician???</p>

<p>There we see that key word again: &#8220;feel&#8221;.   So much of this stuff nowadays is all about feelings, about making people feel good. Is that what it has all come down to   &mdash;    about feeling good about ourselves?  One would think so! We are so obsessed about hurting people&rsquo;s feelings, or with making them feel good about their surroudings, that feelings have come to be our number one priority.  (It also reflects the feminist touch, I would say.) </p>
<p>This is the mark of a rich, self-indulgent, spoiled society&hellip; one that no longer has to be concerned with basics such as feeding and clothing its population, or providing basic housing or employment; so this institution indulges itself in squandering &#8220;several hundred thousand dollars&#8221; on frivolous concerns like &#8220;feelings&#8221;!</p>

<p>There are more than that one.  AA affects all med schools.</p>
<p>Part of the reason this liar in chief wants the revamped health bill is that it contains a clause for quotas in med schools.</p>
<p>But, fear not, nothing they write is going to force you to accept the care of an unqualified brother who doesn&rsquo;t know an antibiotic from a steroid.</p>
<p>There are two blacks (who are truly ignorant) who were added to the staff in one of the cities in my area and already the clinic is hinting about racism, because their practice has fallen off.</p>

		<p>Part of the driving force in educating a more diverse Medical School is that hospitals and insurance companies who are hiring<br>
most of the MD graduates look to minority students to fill their<br>
medical staffs. Minority doctors are more likely to work for less, have less temptation to go into private practice in competition with the hospital, and more likely to make decisions favorable to the hospital in contrast to protecting the health of the patient above all. The public beware.</p>

		<p>Several things will happen because of AA, more qualified whites and asians will be kept out of medical school in favor of blacks and latinos with lower grades and mcat scores. I often how a &#8220;qualified&#8221; minority with excellent grades and mcat scores who could get without AA feel about having classmates with lower qualifications who need help to get into medical school?</p>

<p>You would have a valid point were it not for the fact that &#8220;Blacks&#8221;, and those Whites who outwardly proclaim &#8220;diversity&#8221; in the medical profession are most likely to demand they themselves be treated by White or Asian physicians. </p>
<p>Its kinda like those Whites who cower before &#8220;Blacks&#8221; by pretending to be advocates of neighborhood diversity. One cannot help but notice they never move into &#8220;Black&#8221; neighborhoods, but rather, they advocate resettling &#8220;Blacks&#8221; into White neighborhoods. </p>
<p>Their motive is not hard to figure out. Once &#8220;Blacks&#8221; begin moving in, they have enough time to move on. The problem is that there are becoming fewer and fewer places to where these hypocrites can flee.</p>

		<p>As a note of possible intereset, In Kuwait and Saudi when the citizens of those countries (the White, Arab citizens) need medical care, they go to the U.S. to see WHITE physicians and both of those countries have hundreds of &#8220;minority&#8221; physicians but they will STILL go to the U.S. or Britain for WHITE doctors.</p>

		<p>I myself went to medical school. It was in Québec City, Canada, and there was no affirmative action there.</p>
<p>I had no problem whatsoever with Black and Arab students, who were my classmates; I knew they had gotten in med school the same way I did. That is, with good grades, a good interview, and a good resume or curriculum vitae.</p>
<p>Now, I have to say, if some visible minority students had gotten in the same medical shool as I, but due to a governement program of which the sole objective was to bring more minority students in med school (and the mediacl profession), I most certainly would have had a MAJOR PROBLEM with that!</p>
<p>I say: end affirmative action! If Blacks, Latinos, etc, have what it takes, let them become doctors and practice medicine. And they won&rsquo;t «cut» it, just to bad! No medical scholl should reject promising White applicants to favor people of color who want to become doctors. Doing that, is detrimental to the medical profession, and to patients.</p>

		<p>Okay, one of the best doctors I ever had was a black doctor.  He was exceptional.  Part of the reason he was so good, I think, was because he had that skin condition that some blacks have where he has huge blotches of white skin here and there.  It was always my opinion that because of his looks he had no game with the girls when he was young, and was ostracized by his male &#8220;homie&#8221; peers.  He had no choice but to study and excel among more sensitive and accepting whites.  </p>
<p>The local health clinic actually canned him because he would spend &#8220;too much&#8221; time with his patients.  (Time IS money to them, but his patients really appreciated him.)</p>
<p>With that said, I have never, ever even seen any other black doctor anywhere, so in fairness I would not be able to compare.</p>
<p>The worst doctor I ever had was a clueless Chinese immigrant.  My God he seemed to have some weird personality disorder leaving him unable to not only make any facial expression at all, but also to utter more than one or two garbled words in succession.  Half the time you were unsure if he even was aware you were in the room!</p>
<p>Where I live, there are also not really any white doctors.  (Major urban area)  There are a handful of Jewish or Russian jewish doctors around, but no anglo-saxons that I know of.  Most of the doctors seem to be Indian from Asia.  Some have been good, some have been bad.  I&rsquo;ve never even heard of a latino doctor, other than a dentist here and there.</p>
<p>I do think that AA is a bad policy.  When I look at all the illiterate people around me in this urban area, I think that in 20 years, they&rsquo;re going to be the ones fixing the airplanes and doing the surgeries - and they won&rsquo;t even be able to read or properly understand their manuals!  We&rsquo;re doomed!</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, there is a movie called Idiocracy.  It paints such a real vision of our future centuries from now.  It is ostensibly a comedy, but the tragedy comes when you realize that that is the road we are all on.</p>

		<p>This is similar to an article recently posted on AmRen (Dec 7 or so) about the Surgeon General basically demanding there be more black physicians. Cornell surely knows that somehow dragging in semi-qualified blacks and sticking them on the faculty can only hurt the school so I suspect there are other issues here. </p>
<p>It could be just a PR smoke screen, or a preemptive response to grumbling liberals and/or black shakedown artists, or even an attempt to win the millions in federal dollars for grants and research by sucking up to those now in Washington. </p>
<p>In the end, it does appear that Weill Cornell was, for some reason, pushed into doing this. They probably figure they can simply hire a number of interchangeable Conrad Murray types, call them professor, and put them in low responsibility jobs.  </p>
<p>If you look at the online site it gives off a bland, corporate, legal feeling with carefully chosen words and big friendly fonts that is a complete embarrassment to a world-class medical school. It almost looks like the obligatory &#8220;We Hire Blacks&#8221; diversity pages on fast-food web sites.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.med.cornell.edu/diversity/" rel="nofollow">https://www.med.cornell.edu/diversity/</a></p>
<p>By the way, the rotating photos of doctors and scientists and people in lab coats do not show even ONE white male. </p>
<p>In my case, when someone comments on the pros of &#8220;diversity&#8221; in medicine, I usually respond by saying, &#8220;OK - the next time you need surgery you can go to Affirmative Action General Hospital. How&rsquo;s that sound?&#8221; </p>
<p>And, in case anyone is interested, here are the 2008 entering class statistics at Weill Cornell Medical College:</p>
<p>Applicants: 5827  Entering students: 101  Acceptance rate: 4%</p>
<p>Of the 101 students: <br>
White  72<br>
Asian: 15<br>
Black:  8  </p>
<p>I guess that means there are 8 future faculty members in the pipeline.</p>

		<p>Med schools can do what newspapers did. Hire English speakers, the top ones, from all over the world, from S America and the Caribbean, Asia, even parts of Europe, ones with dark faces and especially names like &#8216;Cruz&rsquo; and &#8216;Soladad&rsquo; so the community is correctly served by diversity, and so those born in America can go on to serve these imports in their service industry jobs. Because nothing is as important as the appearance of diversity.  </p>

		<p>In a classic &#8220;All in the Family&#8221; episode, Archie Bunker said he did not want to be treated by a black doctor because &#8220;No one wants to see a black guy coming at them with a knife.&#8221; I, too, would never want a black doctor doing any major procedure on me because I have no way of knowing if he is a truly qualified specialist or only an &#8220;aff-action&#8221; doctor who filled a med school quota.</p>

		<p>In the early 70s, a physician friend of mine, only a year out of his residency, left private medicine to teach in a medical school.  He was eager to develop new physicians, in a time when women and minorities were now allowed into medical school.  The world would be a better place if the best people, regardless of race and sex, became physicians.</p>
<p>A couple years later he quit.  He said that in a junior class in oncology, he failed a preferred minority in his mid-terms.  He was called into the department chair&rsquo;s office and asked why he gave the student a failing mid-term grade.  My friend answered a question with questions: &ldquo;How did he get into medical school?  How did he get to junior year?&rdquo;  In response, he was told, &ldquo;He already has a &lsquo;C&rsquo; in the course.  Teach him as much medicine as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the year, my friend failed him.  The grade was changed to a &lsquo;C.&rsquo;   He quit to go into private practice.  Later, he asked me, &ldquo;If we let people like that practice medicine, can you imagine what my malpractice rates are going to be in 20 years?&rdquo; </p>
<p>We know the answer to that.</p>
<p>Another physician friend told me that his greatest fear was to be in an accident and wake up with a black face staring at him from behind a surgical mask.</p>

		<p>Unlike poster #12 I never met a good black doctor.  While in the military I would see different doctors on any visit.  When I had a black it was like a visit to Wonderland.  They(the blacks)would either be rude, medically ill-informed, or not interested at all in finding out what was your illness.  One, a Lt Col, actually did a little &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; dance as he lamely tried to &#8220;Splain&#8221; what was wrong.  My dependents I paid out of pocket so they could see a private doctor in the local area rather than run the risk of seeing an affirmative action doctor who couldn&rsquo;t find his rear end with both hands.</p>

		<p>This madness has infected South Africa as well. Shortly before she left the country for good, my daughter took her child to her regular paediatrician, who told her that the practice had recently been pressured to appoint a black partner. Black doctors are thin on the ground, and the only one they could find was a recent graduate of one of the country&rsquo;s formerly prestige universities. This student had failed his exams, but the government let the university know that this was not acceptable, he must be passed.  So the university agreed to give him a supplementary oral exam; furthermore, he could take his cell phone into the exam, so that he could phone a friend if he got stuck for answers. The result of the exam was of course predetermined, and that &#8220;doctor&#8221; is now practising.</p>
