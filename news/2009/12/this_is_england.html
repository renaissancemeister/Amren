			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Billy Briggs, Daily Mail (London), December 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Platform One at Bolton station a mob of around 100 men punch the air in unison. The chant goes up: &#8216;Muslim bombers, off our streets, Muslim bombers off our streets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their voices echo loudly and more men suddenly appear; startled passengers move aside. The group march forward waving St George Cross flags and holding up placards. The throng of men around me applaud. A train heading for Glasgow draws up on the opposite platform and the men turn as one, bursting into song: &#8216;Engelaand, Engelaand, Engelaand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some of the men hide behind balaclavas, others wear black hoodies. A few speak on mobile phones, their hands pressed against their ears to block out the cacophony.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s already kicking off in Manchester. This could be tasty,&rsquo; shouts one. These are some of the most violent football hooligans in Britain and today they have joined together in an unprecedented show of strength. Standing shoulder to shoulder are notorious gangs  &mdash;  or &#8216;firms&rsquo; as they are known  &mdash;  such as Cardiff City&rsquo;s Soul Crew, Bolton Wanderers&rsquo; Cuckoo Boys and Luton Town&rsquo;s Men In Gear.</p>
<p>The gathering is remarkable, as on a match day these men would be fighting each other. But it is politics that has drawn them together. They are headed for Manchester to support a march by the burgeoning English Defence League.</p>
<p>The police are here in force, too. &#8216;Take that mask off,&rsquo; barks a sergeant to one young man. He does so immediately but protests: &#8216;Why are they allowed to wear burkas in public but we&rsquo;re not allowed to cover our faces?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;Just do what you&rsquo;re told,&rsquo; the policeman snaps back.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s always the same these days. One rule for them and another for us. I&rsquo;m sick of this country,&rsquo; a man standing next to me says in a West Country accent.</p>
<p>He draws on a cigarette then flicks it to the ground in disgust. He starts to complain again but when the tannoy announces the arrival of the train to Manchester Piccadilly he raises his hands above his head and starts another favourite.</p>
<p>&#8216;Rule Britannia, Britannia rule the waves .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Britons never, never, never .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo; His companions join in. As the train comes to a halt the crowd surges forward.</p>
<p>The carriages are almost full so the men pack themselves into the aisles followed by policemen speaking into radios. A group of lads drinking beer at a table eye the new contingent warily.</p>
<p>One man wearing a baseball cap clocks their fear and reassures them.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s all right lads, nothing to worry about. We&rsquo;re protesting against radical Islam. Come and join us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Further up the carriage another bursts into song.</p>
<p>&#8216;We had joy, we had fun, we had Muslims on the run,&rsquo; he starts up. Nobody joins in and a couple of his mates tell him to &#8216;shut up&rsquo; as they point to a woman dressed in a black hijab sitting at a table.</p>
<p>A man standing close to her is masked and holds a placard. It has a picture of a Muslim woman crying with red blood streaming down her face. &#8216;Sharia law oppresses women!&rsquo; the slogan reads.</p>
<p>The rise of the English Defence League has been rapid. Since its formation at the start of the summer the group has organised nearly 20 major protests in Britain&rsquo;s cities, including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Luton, Nottingham, Glasgow and Swansea.</p>
<p>Its leaders are professional and articulate and they claim that the EDL is a peaceful, non-racist organisation. But having spent time with them, there is evidence that this movement has a more disturbing side. There is talk of the need for a &#8216;street army&rsquo;, and there are links with football hooligans and evidence that violent neo-Nazi groups including Combat 18, Blood and Honour and the British Freedom Fighters have been attending demos.</p>
<p>Violence has erupted at most of the EDL&rsquo;s demonstrations. In total, nearly 200 people have been arrested and an array of weapons has been seized, including knuckledusters, a hammer, a chisel and a bottle of bleach.</p>
<p>As the EDL gains support across the UK, Muslims have already been targeted in unprovoked attacks. In the worst incident, a mob of 30 white and black youths is said to have surrounded Asian students near City University in central London and attacked them with metal poles, bricks and sticks while shouting racist abuse. Three people  &mdash;  two students and a passer-by who tried to intervene  &mdash;  were stabbed.</p>
<p>Following the Manchester protest, when 48 people were arrested during street violence, the Bolton Interfaith Council Executive issued a stark warning that race relations were under threat and Communities Secretary John Denham compared the EDL to Oswald Mosley&rsquo;s Union of British Fascists, who ran amok in the Thirties. In response to these fears, the National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit, a countrywide police team set up to combat domestic extremism, has been investigating the EDL.</p>
<p>&#8216;The concern to me is how groups like this, either willingly or unwillingly, allow themselves to be exploited by very extreme right-wing groups like the National Front and the British Freedom Fighters,&rsquo; Metropolitan Police chief Sir Paul Stephenson has said.</p>
<p>I had met the English Defence League for the first time in Luton three weeks before the Manchester demonstration. After several calls, key members agreed to talk on the condition that I did not identify them. We met at a derelict building close to Luton town centre. Eleven men turned up. All wore balaclavas, as they often do to hide their identities, and most had black EDL hoodies with &#8216;Luton Division&rsquo; written on the back. They&rsquo;d made placards bearing slogans such as &#8216;Ban the Burka&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s self-proclaimed leader, who goes by the pseudonym Tommy Robinson, did most of the talking. A father of two, Robinson explained the background to the rise of the movement.</p>
<p>&#8216;For more than a decade now there&rsquo;s been tension in Luton between Muslim youths and whites. We all get on fine  &mdash;  black, white, Indian, Chinese &hellip;  Everyone does, in fact, apart from these Muslim youths who&rsquo;ve become extremely radicalised since the first Gulf War. This is because preachers of hate live in Luton and have been recruiting for radical Islamist groups for years. Our Government does nothing about them so we decided that we&rsquo;d start protesting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robinson could barely conceal his anger as he explained that the spark for him had been the sight of radical Muslims protesting when soldiers paraded through the town on their regiment&rsquo;s return from Afghanistan in May.</p>
<p>Following the incident Robinson set up a group called United People of Luton and, after linking up with a Birmingham-based organisation called British Citizens Against Muslim Extremists and another called Casuals United (largely made up of former football hooligans), they realised there was potential for a national movement.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have nothing against Muslims, only those who preach hatred. They are traitors who should be hanged and we&rsquo;ll keep taking to the streets until the Government kicks them out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>More than 100 divisions have been set up across Britain and a careful co-ordination means the EDL is becoming efficient and a potential catch-all for every far-right organisation in Britain.</p>
<p>Robinson admits that he has attended BNP meetings in the past. Another prominent member and administrator of Luton EDL&rsquo;s Facebook group is Davy Cooling, a BNP member. Sean Walsh, an activist for the EDL in Luton, is a member of the BNP&rsquo;s Bedfordshire Facebook group.</p>
<p>Even within the EDL there are concerns over links to extremists. A former member called Paul Ray recently claimed that the group had been hijacked by BNP activists, including a man from Weston-super-Mare, Chris Renton, who helped set up the EDL website. Ironically, Ray himself has extremist contacts, including a German former neo-Nazi who is friends with Northern Ireland Loyalist Johnny &#8216;Mad Dog&rsquo; Adair.</p>
<p>Casuals United was the brainchild of Jeff Marsh, a convicted football hooligan from Cardiff City&rsquo;s Soul Crew, one of the most feared gangs in Britain. Marsh operates behind the scenes, orchestrating activities with both Casuals United and the Welsh Defence League, a sister group of the EDL.</p>
<p>The public face of Casuals United is another Welshman called Mickey Smith. An avowed football hooligan, he is banned from Cardiff City&rsquo;s football ground. Together, Marsh and Smith organise the 50 or so gangs actively recruiting members across the UK.</p>
<p>The EDL insists it is separate from Casuals United, but dig a little and it becomes clear they operate hand-in-hand. Joel Titus is a cocky but politically naive 18-year-old Arsenal fan of mixed race. He tells me that the EDL youth division he runs has over 300 members across the UK.</p>
<p>&#8216;We want to hit every town and city in Britain,&rsquo; he says.</p>
<p>Titus became involved with the movement through Casuals United. And according to anti-fascism magazine Searchlight, his role is to recruit football hooligans.</p>
<p>He sticks to the &#8216;peaceful movement&rsquo; mantra but a text I later receive from him ahead of an EDL demo in London reveals his involvement with the hooligans. It reads: &#8216;Right lads, the &#8220;unofficial&#8221; meet for the 31st (London) is going to be 12 o&rsquo;clock at The Hole In The Wall pub just outside Waterloo Station. I will be there just before that. Remember lads were (sic) going as Casuals Utd and if you could obtain a poppy to wear it would make us look good even if we are kicking off. lol. Cheers lads. Joel &#8220;Arsenal&#8221; Titus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alarmingly, the EDL is becoming more sophisticated and those orchestrating its activities at the top are far more astute than its foot soldiers. I meet two of the EDL&rsquo;s key figures in a Covent Garden pub  &mdash;  a respectable looking man called Alan Lake, and a man who goes by the moniker &#8216;Kinana&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Lake is a 45-year-old computer expert from Highgate, north London who runs a far-right website called Four Freedoms. This summer he contacted the EDL and offered to both fund and advise the movement.</p>
<p>&#8216;Our leaders in this country no longer represent us,&rsquo; he says.</p>
<p>Lake&rsquo;s aim is to unite the &#8216;thinkers&rsquo; and those prepared to take to the streets. He describes this marriage as &#8216;the perfect storm coming together&rsquo;. Lake says that street violence is not desirable but sometimes inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8216;There are issues when you are dealing with football thugs but what can we do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He criticises fascist organisations, however, and says he will only support the EDL so long as it doesn&rsquo;t associate with the BNP. When I ask about extremists hijacking the movement, he says: &#8216;There are different groups infiltrating and trying to cause rifts by one means or another, or trying to waylay the organisation to different agendas. The intention is to exclude those groups and individuals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These men are outwardly intelligent and their political nous combined with the brawn of the casuals makes them a quasi-political force.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s neo-Nazis realise this. For Kevin Watmough, leader of the neo-Nazi British People&rsquo;s Party and a former member of the National Front, the rise of the EDL is reminiscent of the Seventies.</p>
<p>&#8216;The protests remind me of the National Front marches, but I wouldn&rsquo;t march with the EDL because they have blacks as supporters,&rsquo; he told me.</p>
<p>But other neo-Nazis have joined EDL demos. These include members of Combat 18 and the British Freedom Fighters, who later posted videos of themselves on the internet.</p>
<p>Watmough lives in Bradford and can recall the 2001 riots, which came about as a result of tensions between whites and Muslims. Bradford, along with Oldham, another tinderbox northern city that witnessed riots in 2001, is a stated target for the EDL and Casuals United in 2010. Tension is likely here and in other towns where the EDL is also promoting spontaneous flash demos and the occupation of building sites for new mosques.</p>
<p>Professor Matthew Goodwin, an expert on far-right organisations who has advised the Home Office, says that the police are right to monitor the EDL and to take them seriously.</p>
<p>&#8216;(The EDL) is now well-organised and not just a minor irritant. It has become a rallying point for a number of different groups and to have them marching through sensitive areas is a major concern.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Communities Minister John Denham has also condemned the rise of the EDL: &#8216;If you look at the types of demonstrations they have organised, the language used and the targets chosen, it looks clear that it&rsquo;s a tactic designed to provoke, to get a response. It&rsquo;s designed to create violence. And we must all make sure this doesn&rsquo;t happen.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>When you import tribal peoples into your country only one of two things can happen. 1) You civilize them against their will (requires backbone) or 2) You refuse to defend your own culture and let things evolve naturally.</p>
<p>Since the West has chosen choice 2 we are seeing a deevolution to tribalism.  It was bound to happen because &#8220;water only flows downhill&#8221; unless given help.</p>
<p>I just wonder how sincere the EDL is.</p>

		<p> Looks like our Tea Party participants are not the only Caucasians who have finally started to stand up for themselves. Three cheers for the English Defence League, and may they burgeon and grow rapidly.</p>
<p> Wonder if the officialdom who is so in a snit about these conservative activists is as worried about Muslim extremists, or black thugs, in Britain? I doubt it. From the comments of a couple included in the story, they sound like some of our &#8220;Tea Party deniers&#8221; in this country that don&rsquo;t want to admit that what they&rsquo;re seeing is not a fringe group, but a groundswell of outrage from a lot of ordinary people who are finally fed up.</p>

		<p>england is furhest along in replacing the indigeneous population with Muslims and other peope utterly alien to everything english, the the reaction is perhaps stronger there. </p>
<p>we can only hope there is a movement across europe and that is does not veer toward fascism.</p>
<p>what is really missing is a movement against the ethnic cleansing of christians in muslims lands.</p>
<p>despite this encouraging development, overall it is lambs to the slaughter.</p>

<p>A better question is WHEN real men will get off the couch and turn off the television in the USA. This country is worth fighting for. I have known this all my life. And there are traitors HERE who are giving it away. Popular resistance to treason is unavoidable in this country and it won&rsquo;t be much longer. We must be indifferent to losses in this fight.</p>

		<p>If the British government is so concerned about violence against Muslims, then they should actually protect the indigenous British against the continuous onslaught of colored crime.  Their lack of concern for their own people is forcing the masses to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>In general, I think it is perfectly okay (even required) to use violence against foreigners when they are invading your country and displacing your own people.</p>

		<p>The EDL is a pseudo-nationalist group that will take to the streets and march against muslims but they have no problem embracing blacks, Indians or a certain religious minority.  The whole thing is a government backed fraud to distract voters from the BNP.   </p>

		<p>What I object to is that they are not opposing uncontrolled immigration but only Moslem extremists. Caribbean and African blacks, Indians, and Pakistanis are part of the population replacement problem. Slowing down the advance of sharia law is an admirable objective, but the wider war is with their non-White mates.</p>
<p>If there are Moslem moderates, they are as rare as unicorns or they do a good job of hiding.</p>

<p>And thus England&rsquo;s anti-diversity factions were born.  Today it is Muslims.  Tomorrow it will evolve into self-defense forces against ALL non-whites.  And the expansion will be due to black criminal actions and aggression against whites.</p>
<p>And as will be typical of the entire West, we will all be witnesses to the failed multicultural disaster called &#8220;diversity,&#8221; and there will be many trials afterwards to punish the guilty, something they NEVER thought would happen.</p>

		<p>Note the tone of this article.  White people are the only ones doing anything naughty   &mdash;   Muslims are always peace-loving and always behave.  </p>
<p>I think the whole purpose of this article is to smear the BNP.  The Mail is nothing more than Tory Party propaganda, and I think the Tories have it in their heads that many votes cast for the BNP will be drawn away from the Tories.  That runs counter to the conventional wisdom in the UK, that BNP draws votes mainly away from Labour.  The Mail&rsquo;s only concern is winning constituencies for the Tories on election day.</p>

		<p>Orwellian is right. Note the subtle theme: these people are vile, football hooligans, neo-Nazis, but at least they&rsquo;re not evil enough to associate with the BNP.  That&rsquo;s the real target. Everybody agrees that the BNP is evil, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad fact that, world-wide, the only people who seem to be resisting the third-world invasion are this type of people; football hooligans, biker gangs, skinheads, people who fight indiscriminately just because they enjoy it. We may cheer for them, but the fact is, if we (western nations) leave the fight to them, then the fight is lost.  Ordinary people need to wake up and take responsibility for their own destinies. That&rsquo;s why the left fears the BNP more than the EDL.</p>

As a soft suburbanite of a certain age, hooligans from the football terraces aren&rsquo;t exactly my first choice for compadres in our campaign against caucasian extinction. I have no doubt a genteel intellectual like Mr. Jared Taylor is of a similar opinion. But if these rough-and-tumble EDL lads are getting off their butts, recruiting, educating, and actually DOING something about the invasion of their country, then they deserve some respect from everyone here. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope that some white muscle-flexing, public displays of Nationalist pride and solidarity   &mdash;   coupled with a vigorous deportation campaign targeting radical imams   &mdash;   will be enough to get the <i>umma</i> to back down in their quest to establish Caliphate II in our beloved white Europa. Ironically, it might turn out that the <i>threat</i> of violence from our side   &mdash;   by demonstrating to Islam that we&rsquo;re NOT just gonna curl up and die for them   &mdash;   prevents <i>actual</i> violence of the large-scale race rioting which currently look inevitable for Britain&rsquo;s foreseeable future if the country&rsquo;s rampant Islamization is not halted. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really understanding the EDL&rsquo;s objections to the BNP, though. I mean, I can see why the BNP would wanting to keep the EDL at arm&rsquo;s length   &mdash;   much as the politicians of Sinn Fein keep the militants of the IRA at arm&rsquo;s length over in N.Ireland   &mdash;   but I can&rsquo;t see why the EDL would have a problem with the BNP. </p>
<p>Anybody?</p>

The wishes of the majority of Britains on the immigration issue have been ignored by the political establishment.

		<p>Ever since the BNP started gaining steam I&rsquo;ve thought that Britain is the front line for our people.  The idea is that we have to win part of the Anglosphere.  Then we can wage a cultural war against America (via the media and politics), and when the racist American regime falls, freedom will break out all over.</p>

		<p>BNP leader Nick Griffin has made the EDL a proscribed organisation ie BNP members are forbidden to join this group.Nick Griffin (who has decades of experience with Britain&rsquo;s nationalist movement and knows exactly what the state of play is),is convinced that the EDL is actually a &#8216;false-flag&rsquo; operation devised by Britain&rsquo;s infinitely cunning secret services, formed solely to vitiate support for the BNP and damage the BNP by association.<br>
 I am fairly certain that Griffin&rsquo;s judgement on this, as in so many other issues is correct.<br>

ALL NON-WHITES do not belong in Europe and unless they all leave, our problem (and our struggle for our children&rsquo;s future) will remain.

		<p>Several things should be pointed out, I feel.  First, the EDL is avowedly &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; and while they may have racial realists or even neo-nazis among them, the organization itself is no where near either.</p>
<p>Secondly, the EDL is proscribed by the BNP.  If the man who is supposedly a member of the BNP is in fact a member, the mere act of that information being made public means he will not be one for long.  To Nick Griffin&rsquo;s credit he&rsquo;s recognized that while street marches have their uses, rallying support for a political party constantly labeled(falsely, mind you) fascist and &#8216;nazi&rsquo; by its opponents is not one of them.</p>

		<p>I very much doubt if this meets the approbation of real Englishmen. A hundred hooded football hooligans screaming insults at one lone woman wearing a hijab is not a legitimate protest against islam in England. Certainly this same group attacking a massed march of death chanting threatening islamists insulting our returning troops on English soil makes much more sense but is outlawed by our pro-islamic communist government. Meanwhile, a muslim, declared &#8216;British&rsquo; is executed by the Chinese, probably by a single shot through his head, his remains to be buried in China, and, if reports are to be believed, only after useful body parts are removed. Our government doth protest, claiming the victim is mentally deranged. But when a White English Christian uses his home computer to hack around the USA pentagon computer firewall whilst researching UFO sightings, he is immediately betrayed by our government and, although being mentally unstable, is deemed suitable for extradition to USA and destined to serve several decades in some black dominated prison hell-hole. I, as a mature White Englishman, would love to attend the AMREN conference but absolutely refuse to submit to the intrusive racist probing by the US Homeland Security who cannot even detect the threat posed by a known and security listed black african muslim whose attempt to destroy an international airliner was only thwarted by intervention by white passengers. Now, even more thousands of innocent White Christian air passengers will be inconvenienced and delayed when the obvious solution is to bar or restrict all black and/or muslims from air travel. If nigerian muslims object, they can always fly nigerian airways. So, to conclude, just peruse <a href="http://tinyurl.com/36deqe" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/36deqe</a></p>

		<p>Sadly as there are many 
<p>But my experience is that there are British Muslims who are like us in that they do not follow their religion to the word especially where it is a crime to do so. They are accepting the Western way of life as far as civilised living is concerned, but they may be forced to join the radicals if they do not actively report those who are planning terrorist acts, including the downing of international airliners. They will be included by the angry mobs along with the radicals, sad to say.</p>
<p>some need to join the British national party, best thing that can jhappenn to it and it will silence then left-wing (Labour) &amp; the liberals who keep calling the Party racist.</p>
<p>Interesting times are ahead and I forecast that all the moderates amongst us will win and the radical Muslims will be sent back to where they came from or positively converted to be civilised.</p></p>

Anyway, it seems as if my English ancestors have finally had enough. Here in America we have the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights that we are relying on, but it appears to me that these instruments for redress of grievances are being trashed and the officials sworn to uphold the US Constitution are ignoring their oaths of office. So what does that leave us? The Tea Parties may work, but so far they have not as the biggest boondoggle in American history has just been enacted into law, Obamacare. <br>
Now two Hispanic congressman have introduced a law to legalize the 40 million illegals that we have here in this country and all of these illegals are not just Mexicans. (Don&rsquo;t believe the 11,000,000 illegals here that the &#8220;official&#8221; count tells you.)No matter how many times this legalization bill gets defeated it keeps coming back just like Obamacare did. <br>
Once again the will of the American citizens is being ignored. Where do we go from here? <br>

		<p>RE :&#8221;Communities Minister John Denham has also condemned the rise of the EDL: &lsquo;If you look at the types of demonstrations they have organised, the language used and the targets chosen, it looks clear that it&rsquo;s a tactic designed to provoke, to get a response. It&rsquo;s designed to create violence. And we must all make sure this doesn&rsquo;t happen&hellip;&#8221;<br>
Do you get a feeling this guy Denham is not dealing with reality?<br>
Making sure things don&rsquo;t happen was, if I am right, the job of the government that pays Mr Denham&rsquo;s salary. All that was needed to be done was enforcing a hugely supported restriction on immigration. But no, that was asking too much.<br>
What will be truly interesting will be the politics of the generation fathered by the radical Muslims meeting up with the children of parents who are now rediscovering what it means to be racially an Englishman, as opposed to nominally one. Although I suspect a fight will have to occur, I cannot see blood in the veins being bested by thoughts in the head.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Alarmingly, the EDL is becoming more sophisticated and those orchestrating its activities at the top are far more astute than its foot soldiers. I meet two of the EDL&rsquo;s key figures in a Covent Garden pub &mdash; a respectable looking man called Alan Lake, and a man who goes by the moniker &lsquo;Kinana&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Lake is a 45-year-old computer expert from Highgate, north London who runs a far-right website called Four Freedoms. This summer he contacted the EDL and offered to both fund and advise the movement.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This article is a carefully crafted piece of propaganda designed to divide whites.  It portrays a normal backlash of white people to an absurd and highly anti-white racist situation in the most negative way possible.</p>
<p>The protestors are &#8220;racists&#8221;, criminals, very violent and irrational in their behavior.  At the same time they are somehow politically correct and selective in their extremism.  In other words, not worth the time of serious folk who correctly identify who and what the problem is.</p>
<p>See how that works?  Normal, decent folk, who are ignorant or otherwise on the fence don&rsquo;t want to be associated with &#8220;thugs&#8221;.  White nationalists looking for others to join with them don&rsquo;t want wanna be idiots who associate with blacks and stupidly think only &#8220;radical&#8221; muslims or certain problematic non-whites are the ones destroying the country.  Other non-whites are OK.  Yeah&hellip;no they are not.</p>
<p>How much of this is true?  Some of it?  Any of it?</p>
<p>Certainly, white people are conflicted about race, about the treason their governments are committing against them and, most importantly, what to do about it.</p>
<p>But this article seeks to manipulate this and turn off whites of various types from working together.</p>

<p>  Unfortunately, these days, the rest of the chant could be &#8220;and get on a plane for the United States.&#8221; Why we allow potential Jihadists to get Visas to visit the United States is Political Correctness gone insane. I suppose our diversity is more precious than profiling terrorists. </p>

		<p>I must say that the appearance of The English Defence League,coming just before a general election,and at a time when the BNP is finally starting to shake off its football &#8220;hooligan&#8221; image smacks of conspiratorial intervention by a hostile agency trying to undermine its newfound semi-credibility.I also find it a little bewildering that an organisation purporting to represent England should hold rallies in Glasgow and Cardiff,where hostility to all things Anglo-Saxon is fostered in the cradle.</p>

		<p>Here in the U.S. it&rsquo;ll be more of the same. </p>
<p>Soft, doughy whites, entranced by their X-Box or PlayStation, will remain the same - demure little serfs sitting quietly in the middle of the flock. </p>
<p>For the majority of white automatons: Sonia-the-&#8220;Wise Latina&#8221; is already forgotten, the names Frank Ricci, Van Jones and Nidal Hassan are meaningless, Tiger is a victim, Afghanistan is merely a headline&hellip;</p>
<p>It seems most whites are hell-bent on slipping quietly into the night. </p>

		<p>You know, I think the posters who make the point the EDL may be &#8220;agents provocateurs&#8221; might be on to something. False flag ops are works of art and the intelligence agencies have become artistes.<br>
For instance, I am of the opinion the massive and well-coordinated Mexican immigration rallies of a few years ago were false flag ops. I wondered then, and still think now, the sheer scale and grandeur of those rallies hints at professional management. I think they were organized so the feds could get really good videos of the Aztlanites for future investigation. <br>
The decline of Mexico into failed-state-narco-republic status makes the Brits&rsquo; problems with nasty burqa-babes look kinda small. </p>
