			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Claire Ellicott, Daily Mail (London), November 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Radio 4 is hoping to increase its appeal to ethnic minorities as part of a push to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>The station will commission material aimed at black or Asian listeners, such as a show on patois presented by Rastafarian poet Benjamin Zephaniah.</p>
<p>Radio 4 has previously been criticised for being &#8216;too white&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Station controller Mark Damazer met race equality campaigners to discuss how to make its workforce more diverse.</p>
<p>He admitted there was also a lack of black and Asian presenters, but warned this will take time to change as many slots are taken by established stars.</p>
<p>Ashok Viswanathan, a founder of Operation Black Vote, said the meeting with Mr Damazer was &#8216;encouraging&rsquo; and he hoped Radio 4 would commit to making changes. &#8216;You look at the faces at the station and it doesn&rsquo;t look like 21st century Britain,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Last night, Tory MP Philip Davies said it was &#8216;patronising&rsquo; to presume ethnic minorities would not be interested in the same programmes as everyone else.</p>
<p>A Radio 4 spokesman insisted it &#8216;aims to reflect the UK&rsquo;s audience&rsquo; but denied that any shows would be axed in favour of &#8216;more diverse&rsquo; programming.<br>

		<p>Typical of minorites, they apparently can&rsquo;t grasp the concept of establishing their own organizations. Instead, they expect whites to provide the opportunities for them.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see how fast Radio 4 reverts back to its old format when ratings start dropping.</p>

<p>Well, myself and at least a hundred thousand other whites would be glad to stop listening so they can become more diverse.</p>
<p>Any white who listens to them now is an absolute idiot.</p>

		<p>Westerners of all political stripes - other than elitist that is - should come together in demanding that &#8220;diversity,&#8221; insofar as it&rsquo;s to be implemented, should be a top-down affair.  Let the BBC sort out its &#8220;hideously white&#8221; management before it worries about anyone else&rsquo;s &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Basically, they should make their bed and lie in it first.  Let them lead by example.</p>

		<p>Well, as with housing, as soon as the ethnics come in the whites will get out.</p>
<p>Radio 4&rsquo;s ratings will drop like a stone once they fill the airways with ethnics whining away about their pet obsessions. It&rsquo;s a great business opportunity for the private sector - those listeners will be up for an alternative. </p>
<p>Radio4 already has a barely comprehensible West Indian announcer - and yet there are no Regional English accents to be heard - ever.</p>

		<p>BBC already has 1 Xtra, a &#8220;Black&#8221; music station, and BBC Asian Network.  Are these to be changed for being &#8220;too Black/Asian&#8221;, and there are countless specialist ethnic radio stations all over the country.  Why do they need more?  </p>

		<p>If Benjamin Zephaniah is a true rasta, whats he doing in England?<br>
I thought they were all supposed to go back to Africa. He is a cocky so and so and adds nothing to the pro immigration debate anyways.<br>
Radio 4 will lose high brow white listeners and that will be the end of another English institution.. <a href="https://northfieldpatriot.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://northfieldpatriot.blogspot.com/</a></p>

		<p>The problem with some non-whites is that their use of English can be a serious distraction. For a visual comparison imagine a TV presenter picking his nose. Pakistanis and Indians tend to mangle their words such that it is very difficult to understand them.  In any case, I do not want to hear presenters on British radio with Indian and Pakistani accents.  If I lived in India I would endure it.  Now and again a male presenter, with the name of Neil, and a very strong West Indian accent, will introduce programmes on BBC Radio 4. When I first heard him I thought I had mistakenly tuned into some ghastly reggae station. I was astonished that the editors of BBC Radio 4, the BBC&rsquo;s main station for serious news, could allow an individual with such a strong and alienating accent to introduce anything.  Were this person on a music channel introducing West Indian bongo oil drum music it would not be a problem (no offence meant Neil old chap whatever your second name is if you read this post). Strangely, I especially resent ethnic accents and voices presenting the weather forecast.  A good, strong, clear Scottish accent informing us that we are going to be snowed in is marvellous and much to be preferred to some alienating, ethnic accent.  Oh dear, I suppose I must be incorrigibly racist.</p>
