<h1>Nova Scotia Finds &#8216;Alarming&rsquo; Number of Black Students in Special Programs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Canadian Press, December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A report for the Nova Scotia government says there&rsquo;s evidence that an &#8220;alarming number&#8221; of the province&rsquo;s 4,000 black students are being placed in special programs for students with academic difficulties.</p>
<p>The 107-page study for the Department of Education says that often excludes them from post-secondary education.</p>
<p>It also concluded that black students are still finding programs designed to assist them are &#8220;out of reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report comes 15 years after the province acknowledged the school system needed to combat racial inequality.</p>
<p>It examined 12 programs that were created by the province after another report in 1994.</p>
<p>That report found that in the early 1990s, few black students were obtaining a university education, citing census data showing 50 per cent of black high school students were dropping out.</p>
<p>The report released Thursday said a program set up to provide support workers to black students has been effective, but the workers &#8220;are responsible for too large a caseload of students.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also found a rise in the number of black students obtaining post-secondary scholarships  &mdash;  from 246 in 2004 to 378 students in 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;This review will give us valuable insight into what is working and where we can improve,&#8221; Education Minister Marilyn More said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to help all students reach their full potential, and this report and feedback on it can help us do just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>More said she would provide a more formal response to the report in the spring after public feedback.<br>

<p>A 15 year effort and all they have to show is more blacks in special programs.</p>
<p>In an odd coincidence, the failure for blacks in Buffalo schools is 53%. Eerily similar to the 50% stated here.</p>
<p>I guess Canadians will have to &#8216;double their efforts&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that Nova Scotia was a slavery state.  Nothing else could account for the &#8220;inequality&#8221; here except for the curse of institutionalized &#8220;white privilege&#8221; in your society.</p>

		<p>The Nova Scotia educational system should learn from the American experience. Americans have pumped enormous amounts of financial largesse, as well as promoting anti-white discrimination, to boost the academic performance of black students. The Kansas City super-school debacle was the most obscene of all the initiatives undertaken. Yet nothing has been accomplished. Why not just admit that black test scores will remain lower than those of other races? After all, we admit that men can&rsquo;t give birth, that the sun rises in the east and not in the west, and that there is more nitrogen than oxygen in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. These are all acknowledged facts. Can we not do the same with blacks&rsquo; inability to perform well at school?</p>

<p>If most blacks complete grade school by the time they&rsquo;re 16, they HAVE REACHED their full potential.</p>
<p>Accept it!  And then say, &#8220;Mission accomplished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This review will give us valuable insight into what is working and where we can improve,&rdquo; Education Minister Marilyn More said in a statement.&#8221;</p>
<p>See where they&rsquo;re at now?  The same place they have been here for over 40 years:  Still refusing to accept the intellectual differences between blacks and other races, so they redouble their failing efforts and declare the problem is with them rather than black low I.Q.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to think the pre-requisite for being an academic is stupidity.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I go where the facts lead me. </p>

If they follow the typical procedures, the above quote is a lie. They have little or no interest in &#8220;helping all students to reach their full potential&#8221;, but rather are only interested in improving black grades, even if it is at the expense of white students. </p>

<p>I think maybe the people who keep coming up with these plans to uplift blacks are reaching beyond THEIR potential. The blacks, as #5 said, have already reached their potential and anything further would be to raise the Titanic and not expect it to sink again.</p>

		<p>It seems that every majority white place in the world has to learn the hard way about the realities of black intellectual capabilities.  They never learn from the experiences of places that already have a lot of black people because they know that the white people in those areas are &#8220;racist&#8221;, and thus can&rsquo;t be trusted.<br>

Equality of opportunity? Yes, absolutely, by all means.</p>
<p>Equality of <i>outcome</i>? Not so much. </p>
<p>Our academic overlords need to face the fact that some people are born to be rocket scientists and some are born to be Pullman porters. And, moreover, insisting that future Pullman porters SHOULD be rocket scientists will only frustrate the former and degrade the quality of the latter. </p>

		<p>In the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s blacks were PROUD to be Pullman Porters.  And they put their hearts into it, learning all they needed to know, being polite and helpful, and being grateful for a very well paying career job with the railroads.  Blacks sought those jobs and were ecstatic when they got them, knowing they had a steady job and a career.<br>
But, the Liberals told them they all deserved to be rocket scientists and that by accepting the Porter jobs they were demeaning themselves.  Outcome?  No black rocket scientists, no black porters, black unemployment grows, black discontent grows because they can&rsquo;t understand it was all a lie and are now refusing to ACCEPT that they are generally lower IQ and suited for some jobs while not suited for others.  Most WHITE mothers told their kids they could be anything they wanted to be if they worked hard enough.  Most white kids realized that they had limitations and would never be nuclear physicists, renowned authors, whatever.  They reached their potential and accepted it.  Whites are proud of their work, because they try to do the best they can in whatever they do, and recognize their work is necessary and valuable.  Blacks, on the other hand, never accept reality.  They prefer the liberal lie that they ALL are rocket scientists just waiting to bloom, and the only thing keeping them down is Whitey and prejudice.  They never accept their limitations and in fact get angry and violent when they come up against the wall of their limitations and intelligence in the workplace.  I&rsquo;ve seen it, and been the target of it myself.</p>

		<p>The whole situation is like the old cliche of trying to put a square peg in a round hole. I think that much of the bad behavior by Blacks is a result of being forced into classes that are over their head. They get confused and behind so they have to act out simply out of boredom. Of course that is not the only reason but certainly a factor. They need to be in classes that are to their level where they can get a rudimentary academic education while learning a trade so that they can gain some sort of employment other than welfare mooch. Before welfare even low IQ blacks were able to get some sort of gainful employment, with exceptions of course. </p>

		<p>#14 Anonymous brings up a good point about Pullman porters, etc.  </p>
<p>Two cases in point: my mother helped her maid get a job as a sewing machine operator for a clothing maker in Los Angeles back in the early 1950s.  This obviously predates nonsense like hiring quotas.  Maggie got the job and was thrilled to have it.  About 6 months later, my mother got a call from Maggie.  Seems she had moved up to supervising 130 sewing machine operators.  This does not sound like much to us today, but to Maggie this was a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Another case in point: a janitor we had at our elementary school eventually went out on his own, providing his services to private clients.  He built up a moderate-size business out of all this.</p>
<p>In both cases, these black folks rose to their potential by working their butts off.  In both cases, it was the days when things were still segregated, there were no special programs, and there were no government-mandated quotas, or moving children around the city like so many chess pieces in order to achieve &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>
<p>All of these programs and laws have been so profoundly wrong!  Let folks seek their own levels; in most cases they will do just fine.</p>
