			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Klein, East Bay Express (Oakland), December 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Berkeley High School is considering a controversial proposal to eliminate science labs and the five science teachers who teach them to free up more resources to help struggling students.</p>
<p>The proposal to put the science-lab cuts on the table was approved recently by Berkeley High&rsquo;s School Governance Council, a body of teachers, parents, and students who oversee a plan to change the structure of the high school to address Berkeley&rsquo;s dismal racial achievement gap, where white students are doing far better than the state average while black and Latino students are doing worse.</p>
<p>Paul Gibson, an alternate parent representative on the School Governance Council, said that information presented at council meetings suggests that the science labs were largely classes for white students. He said the decision to consider cutting the labs in order to redirect resources to underperforming students was virtually unanimous.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sincular-Mertens [Mardi Sicular-Mertens, the senior member of Berkeley High School&rsquo;s science department], who has taught science at BHS for 24 years, said the possible cuts will impact her black students as well. She says there are twelve African-American males in her AP classes and that her four environmental science classes are 17.5 percent African American and 13.9 percent Latino. {snip}</p>
<p>The full plan to close the racial achievement gap by altering the structure of the high school is known as the High School Redesign. It will come before the Berkeley School Board as an information item at its January 13 meeting. {snip}</p>

		<p>Since blacks don&rsquo;t take courses that require time in science labs, the money is wasted from their perspective.  Better to close the labs than to benefit Whites. This also is an indication of just how expensive it is to run a black school. There is a horrendous layout of cash for small returns.<br>

Ah, No Student Left Behind. I told my wife things like this would happen. I suppose now we&rsquo;ll begin to hear more talk of importing foreign scientists to make up for the lack of native born science students. All because black and latino students are doing worse.<br>

		<p>Well, it is Berkley so one can&rsquo;t help feeling the nitwits there deserve some of what they&rsquo;ve been cheerleading for. But it does set a bad precedent so I oppose it on principle. More importantly, in case there is still someone insane enough to think socialized medicine is a good idea this is why it&rsquo;s not. Consider the socialized medicine equivalent - canceling cancer research to funnel more money to AIDS research and drug rehab.</p>

		<p>New York state wants to cut agricultural programs because they benefit mostly white students.  Berkeley wants to cut science classes because they benefit mostly white students. Isn&rsquo;t this obvious racial discrimination.  Would you ever get away with eliminating a program that mostly benefited students of color?</p>
<p>On a more practical note, shouldn&rsquo;t we, as a society, encourage the brightest among us?  The black rapper is not going to find a cure for the new incurable strain of TB is he?  </p>

<p>Sir, your last sentence is one of the big reasons we&rsquo;re in the jam we find ourselves in. We need good people in all strata of society. Not just in whitecollar areas. A man who can put his hands on work is every bit as good as a person who sits behind a desk. Remember, it was white males who built this country through their braun and brainpower, notwithstanding the ridiculous myths being circulated by the fedgov that tells everyone blacks and other minorities did the work.</p>

<p>And the deterioration of this empire continues as expected, especially California.</p>
<p>2010 will be the year these administrative fools will see much funding cut back to levels they never dreamed possible, and with it most&hellip;if not all&hellip;of their nonsense social programs.</p>
<p>There has been NO RECOVERY, only a slight uptick from bailout money, but it&rsquo;s running out and there ain&rsquo;t no mo&rsquo;.  Stick around and see for yourself.</p>
<p>Be prepared for the economic shock waves to hit in 2010.  And, remember, you heard it here first.</p>

		<p>Yet, I&rsquo;m sure many minorities at Berkeley High fancy themselves as future doctors.  Don&rsquo;t all doctors in training have to do lab science courses in college?</p>
<p>As I was reading this story, I thought I was reading an addendum to Harrison Bergeron by Kurt Vonnegut.</p>
<p>Also, this is an insane thing to do.  The minorities have already proven their academic incompetence, so why devote all those resources to them?  Limited resources should go to science labs and advanced classes, not to proven failures.  If Thomas Edison spent more time and money on light bulb designs that didn&rsquo;t work rather than ones that showed promise of working, he would have never engineered a successful design, and we would all be in the dark tonight.  (Though some might say that we&rsquo;re all in the dark even in the day.)  Educators can&rsquo;t seem to apply this simple wisdom to their profession.</p>

		<p>According to their website, they were &#8220;the first public high school in the United States with an African American Studies department, established in 1969&#8221;.  Is there any doubt that an &#8220;African American Studies dept.&#8221; would benefit mainly blacks?  Of course not, but this did not seem to bother them.  However, a science dept. that seems to benefit mainly whites, that bothers them!  Obviously there is a lot of racism there against whites.</p>
<p>It is encouraging to note that many of the comments on their page would fit right in at Amren.</p>

		<p>Berkeley&rsquo;s racial composition is not as skewed as Berkeley High&rsquo;s would suggest. Berkeley is 59% White, 16% Asian, 14% black and about 10% Hispanic. The blacks from the flats see the school as better than an Oakland or Richmond school. White liberals overlook the fact that many that attend don&rsquo;t have a right to based on which city they actually reside in. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, &#8216;they&rsquo; don&rsquo;t think that far ahead. If it&rsquo;s a victory for them today, that&rsquo;s all they require. Thinking longterm is not something everyone does. Nor is appreciating the many cures that have already been discovered and created.</p>

		<p>This is one of those articles that so perfectly illustrates why a multiracial society is a terrible idea that will never truly work, that we couldn&rsquo;t make it up if we tried. What more evidence do whites need that virtually the whole thrust of our modern, multiracial society is geared toward propping up the lower orders and dragging down the higher? And who among us is not yet clear which one of those groups is which?!</p>

<p>Well Comrade Gibson, I am certain that this &ldquo;virtually unanimous&rdquo; vote was also approved by an assortment of tycoon baboons and titillated troglodytes!</p>
<p>The very idea of this is so disgusting to me, that I will only note one quick point for the sake of decorum: Multiculturalism, for all its &ldquo;lofty goals,&rdquo; is simply degenerate superstitions and absurd animalisms masked as &ldquo;progress.&rdquo; The earth is not a globe, but a flattened cube; the wind is the wings of dragons and bats flapping wildly; and the stars are simply flickering candles.</p>
<p>Absolutely bizarre: &ldquo;&hellip;where white students are doing far better than the state average while black and Latino students are doing worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe, throwing rocks at the moon could change this reality too; right, Comrade Gibson?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>2 Anglo-Saxon: Blacks and Hispanics do Not belong in shop classes.  Shop is for serious students only.  How much damage can a fool do with an English textbook?  Compare that to the same fool with a welding torch.  One reason that school districts have discarded shop classes is the cost.  You have smaller classes because close supervision is absolutely essential.  You have expensive, easily ruined machinery.  And, you have liability insurance.  This is all very expensive, and totally wasted on dull-minded goof-offs.  Shop is for young people who want to go to work at age 18, not hang out on a street corner or go to a resort that masquerades as a university.  By all means, set up AfricanAmerican or LatinoHispanicMexican studies programs, but don&rsquo;t dump the garbage into vocational education.  You might as well put water into your motor oil.  </p>

		<p>Here is a very good example of how &#8216;diversity&rsquo; actually imposes a real, tangible cost on those unfortunate enough to be trapped in a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; environment.<br>
 The point is that the more able students have been denied an important life-chance to study science - and the possibility of inculcating an interest and possibly a future in that most important field.This denial is done wholly in the service of the less able, this represents a straightfoward abgenation of everything excellence in education, the ideal held in esteem ever since the ancient Greeks, stands for.<br>
 No one would run a football team like that for example, but with education, something infinitely more precious, modern America deems it &#8216;acceptable&rsquo;.</p>

<p>On the one hand you hear messages telling us how important it is to educate future generations in the sciences.  On the other hand we can&rsquo;t afford to teach a bunch or white kids science because the resources are needed to teach non-whites basic skills (reading, writing, arithmetic).</p>

		<p>Looks like the British Labour (Democrat) Party&rsquo;s principle of &#8220;Pursuit of Mediocrity&#8221; is in force instead of the correct &#8220;Pursuit of Excellence&#8221;.  China is that much closer to becoming the First World top power instead of the USA if this is encouraged and as some have written, it is definitely a racist move to take such actions that adversely affect the best students who appear to be whites and Asians.  This needs a mass movement by the taxpayers who are affected after all, it is your cash that is being wasted.</p>

The Berkley crowd is very likely to believe in made induced global warming.</p>
<p>If man made global warming is true, then the answers will be found in the hard sciences such as physics, chemistry, and engineering. So the liberals are defunding the very programs that could save the world from warming.</p>
<p>More proof that liberalism is a mental illness characterized by an inability to see reality. Leave these people alone and they would die off on their own. Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re taking us with them.</p>

<p>We are too. I was recently in Singapore. I couldn&rsquo;t believe how clean and safe it was. Young people there who don&rsquo;t study are relegated as janitors and laborers. They aren&rsquo;t allowed to drag down good students. Being a drug dealer or other violent criminal isn&rsquo;t an option. Such people are quickly removed from society&hellip;no one ever sees them again. We need that here.</p>

		<p>Looking down the road, far down that is, things will become very twisted.  Due to actions such as this across the country, particularly in urban school settings, more and more whites and asians will put their kids into private schools, and private schools will begin to flourish, with more and more of them opening and creating a cost competetive environment making them affordable to the lower middle class.  At some point in time however, the other side, ie. the goverment schools will somehow claim racial discrimination.  They will say the whites have better scores and opportunities becuase they go to private schools.  Even though they operate at lower budgetts, but they will conviently ignore that. There will be class action suites against them, closings, mergers, and major efforts to bring in huge numbers of &#8220;minorites&#8221; on some kind of scholorship.  Eventually most of the affordable private schools will be mirror images of the public school.  Then what?</p>

		<p>Poster 21 Riley de Wiley, I saw &#8220;School Colors&#8221; this past year.  It&rsquo;s a documentary about integration at Berkeley High School, and it shows the racial differences clearly.  Capable Whites and Chinese, Viva La Raza Mexicans, and Afro-centric Blacks.  I don&rsquo;t know how many copies there are left in this country.  I got mine through an inter-library loan and it came from  Missouri because there were none in California.  And it was video, not dvd.  I think they&rsquo;re getting this movie is ready for the memory hole.</p>

		<p>Something you folks aren&rsquo;t considering is that this is all a deliberate agenda to make us a third world, dumbed down, whipped society.  If you all this together, the multicultural agendas, the open illegal immigration, the allowing Africans and only Africans to legally immigrate, the socialist methods of wealth distribution, the elevating of minorities over the white population in every venue, and the Dems and neo-cons controlling the government and country you can only come to one conclusion:  it&rsquo;s on purpose and all works together to produce a dumbed down, incohesive, ignorant and third world society.  Such a society is MUCH more able to be controlled and terrified than an intelligent, white, astute society.  Such a society is actually USED to totalitarianism, government murder, terror of it&rsquo;s citizens, lawlessness, and underachieving.  It&rsquo;s no coincidence that the more &#8220;multicultural&#8221; and less educated we become, the more Socialist tyranny is passed through Gov onto our backs.  The condition of whites being in the minority and the waking up to the final absolute tyranny over us will happen at the same time.</p>

		<p>This seems a perfectly reasonable reaction to lack of black achievement in the sciences.  Black Studies and black history courses make a lot more sense in order to help the struggling minority students.</p>
<p>First, there&rsquo;s so much less to study and learn, which would greatly enhance the self-esteem of the black students, plus increasing their graduation rate.  Second, it would practically ensure a sharp increase in the number of welfare recipients, which would require hiring additional social services employees.  It&rsquo;s a win-win, Obama style!</p>

<p>I, too, saw that documentary that 21 Riley DeWiley spoke about.  But I saw it just months before I graduated from high school, in 1995.  One of the things I most remember is that the Hispanics were upset that there had been a black studies department for decades, so they picketed for a Chicano Studies Department.  That, and the black students called the white hangouts &#8220;France&#8221; and the Asian ones &#8220;China.&#8221;</p>
<p>35:  That&rsquo;s probably the reason it will never be on DVD.  It was made several years before the introduction of DVDs, and since PBS seems to want to dump it down the Orwellian memory hole, the only copies that would exist at all today would be on VHS.</p>

		<p>At the very best (by the multicult&rsquo;s standards), blacks and latinos have a culture which is actively hostile to education. This is no exagerration - there&rsquo;s is a culture which hates education, where there is no early learning in the home and no pressure to succeed.</p>
<p>At the the very worst, science is eventually going to prove (if it hasn&rsquo;t already) that hispanics and blacks simply can&rsquo;t hack it genetically when it comes to achieving in modern, advanced first-world societies.</p>
<p>In either case - culture or genetics - it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Cutting educational opportunities at the top to raise scores at the bottom is a waste. In five years time, the whites and asians who can afford it will have left the school, more latinos and blacks will flood in, and scores will be as bad as ever. Probably worse. It&rsquo;s easy enough to test - let&rsquo;s revisit this in 5 years.</p>

<p>Even in shop classes, thought and logic must be applied to welding, machining, and metalworking operations.You know, it never really hit me why there seems to be more and more recalls of automobiles for defective parts in recent years, until I considered the racial makeup of the auto manufacturing labor force in Detroit. Then, it all became clear.</p>
<p>To think that Henry Ford used unskilled Bantu labor from the South, as a means of union-busting in the 1930&rsquo;s. He probably didn&rsquo;t realize it, but he was sowing the seeds for the eventual destruction of Detroit.</p>
<p>Schoolteacher, would you want to purchase a $ 300,000 home, with the knowledge that it was built by unskilled Bantu and mestizo labor? I didn&rsquo;t think so. Yet, that&rsquo;s exactly the painted corner we are being forced into.</p>
<p>And then people wonder why this country is losing its &#8220;competitive edge&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>45 Soprano Fan: Welding and machining call for more, not less thinking than is required in most college courses.  Try telling a piece of steel that White privilege is keeping it from assuming the form it ought to be in and that you will deconstruct its heuristic hermenutics if it doesn&rsquo;t shape up.  If that doesn&rsquo;t work, neither will a Share Out or a sob story about child abuse.  No, the student must master the knowledge of the material, the tools, and the techniques, in order to make things happen.  And the standards are objective and exact: Is your workpiece .875 inches in diameter, plus or minus .002?  Shop classes are much like science classes, in that there are regular experiments to test your theory.  To pass a shop class, you have to understand the realities of the physical world and apply them.    <br>
       I think that the main reason for the decline in the quality of skilled workers is that the people who would have become excellent mechanics or carpenters 60 years ago now are pushed into college.  In order to fill the seats, pay the tuition, and keep the professors paid, the college industry has to convince millions of young people to waste four years or more memorizing trivia.  They will take the dumb non-Whites if they come with a grant or loan, but the real bonanza is the middle class White whose parents think that $25,000 a year is an investment.  And a fine prospective electronics technician will end up with a degree in sociology, sitting in an office, gossiping and sorting and playing fantasy football.  </p>

This whole &#8220;college mentality&#8221; in which the college types&#8221; are taught to think of themselves as (elites) superior to those who work with their hands (as well as their minds) has got to go.<br>
I do not have a &#8220;college degree&#8221; but am self-educated in the various sciences as well as the humanities.  I have taken on these &#8220;degreed&#8221; college types in philosophical and scientific debates; most of them are surprised to learn that I do not have a degree.  Althought, most of them are decent, there are those who will discount anything I say due to my lack of a degree.  This goes to show how close-minded some of these &#8220;college types&#8221; can be.  The engineering types are usually the most receptive to challenging debate.  The &#8220;superiority&#8221;  phenomenen occurs mostly in those who are &#8220;educated&#8221; in the social sciences (liberals).  They tend to walk around with their noses &#8220;up in the air&#8221; and spout their &#8220;superiority&#8221; to (us) mere mortals.  obama comes to mind as being one of these &#8220;blue bloods&#8221; (actually our &#8220;half-blood&#8221; prince).<br>
A good example of &#8220;close-minded&#8221; thought crowding out good ideas is that of the case of Stanford Ovshinsky.  A self-taught machinist by trade, he taught himself the physical sciences.  He came up with the concept of &#8220;amorphous semiconductors&#8221; which could be sprayed on a substrate rather than conventional semiconductor manufacturing which required &#8220;growing&#8221; crystalline structures to manufacture them.  This decreased the cost of manufacturing semiconductors immensely.<br>
His ideas were ridiculed by these so-called &#8220;college-types&#8221;.  His company (Energy Conversion Devices) is a multi-million dollar operation.  His technology is licensed to major electronics manufacturers (Sony, Sharp, etc.) and has made him wealthy and much in demand.  The &#8220;institutions of higher learning&#8221; which once ridiculed his ideas now invite him to speak (and offer his ideas) on a regular basis.<br>
Mr. Ovshinsky once said that if he had obtained a regular &#8220;engineering education&#8221; he probably would have not come up with his ideas.<br>
So much for college being a &#8220;forum&#8221; for open discussion.</p>

		<p>My daughter tells me the number one, largest organization of the Cal Berkeley students is The Young Republicans, so maybe there is hope for the next generation when the insanity of the 60s collapses.  Hopefully, they&rsquo;ll become a voting bloc in the Bolshevik-controlled city.</p>
<p>And, I am not surprised. </p>
<p>I saw recently, this past spring, how many White and Asian college hopefuls were locked out of scholarships, college placements, &#8216;outreach&rsquo; services, ignored or scorned by college counselors and the colleges themselves  &mdash;  while hispanic and black students with drastically lower achievement and test scores were fawned over, flown to elite colleges (all expenses paid) offered full scholarships, received personal at-home visits from college recruiters, targeted by government-funded outreach programs and more.  The better students helplessly watched and took note of all of this.</p>
<p>The righteous anger was unbelievable from my daughter and her friends  &mdash;  many of them realizing that all they&rsquo;d been taught about &#8216;equality&rsquo; and downtrodden non-Whites, was an utter lie. I head several wonder what the point was of studying so hard and sacrificing so much of their young lives for so many years only to be locked out of the premiere universities.</p>
<p>Good!  It&rsquo;s about time that generation was hit hard by reality. As heirs to the US, they will need to become furious at the current situation as their future earnings are mortgaged and their basic freedoms curtailed by the USG to pay for a White-hating underclass.  They need to see for themselves that THEY are the ones who will pay the price when they are a minority beholden to a White-hating majority.</p>
<p>As for science labs being cut:  This is going on all over as AP and honors classes are eliminated to pay for more lower-level reading programs and remedial math classes.  This is part of the &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; of the current &#8216;egalitarian&rsquo; government  &mdash;  I put &#8216;egalitarian&rsquo; in quotes because it is a lie-a big lie.  This is about elevating hispanics and blacks ABOVE White children.</p>
<p>The only thing that will change this current situation is to vote out the morons on the school board  &mdash;  when enough parents become enraged that their tax dollars are being wasted on the lowest common denominator at the expense of their high-achieving children. When voters realize that they must pay for an expensive private education for their own children plus the expensive futility of educating non-educable hispanics and blacks. </p>
<p>The school board members are voted in locally and are supposed to represent the local citizens  &mdash;  is this what the voters want for their own children?</p>
<p>I do not know the current political voting climate of Berkeley, but I do take the strong showing of The Young Republicans as a hopeful sign of sanity  &mdash;  not that I have much faith in Republicans, but they are better on this situation than the far-left, entrenched, White-hating Democratic party that currently rules Berkeley.</p>
