<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/science/01arch.html?_r=1">A Lost European Culture, Pulled From Obscurity</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Noble Wilford, New York Times, December 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Before the glory that was Greece and Rome, even before the first cities of Mesopotamia or temples along the Nile, there lived in the Lower Danube Valley and the Balkan foothills people who were ahead of their time in art, technology and long-distance trade.</p>
<p>For 1,500 years, starting earlier than 5000 B.C., they farmed and built sizable towns, a few with as many as 2,000 dwellings. They mastered large-scale copper smelting, the new technology of the age. Their graves held an impressive array of exquisite headdresses and necklaces and, in one cemetery, the earliest major assemblage of gold artifacts to be found anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The little-known culture is being rescued from obscurity in an exhibition, &#8220;The Lost World of Old Europe: the Danube Valley, 5000-3500 B.C.,&#8221; which opened last month at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University. {snip}</p>

		<p>Incredible. I&rsquo;ll be seeing this exhibit.</p>
<p>There are recent findings and theories that Europa was actually first in the new world. There are tall mummies with red and fair hair turning up in the Tarim Basin of western China millennia before the first known contact. Perhaps history may well have to be re-written.  </p>
<p>In Europe they intensely study the artifacts like those in this exhibition and Otzi the Ice Man (they even built a museum just for him). <br>
Here in the USSA we go the other way. Remains that are many thousands of years old (Buhl Woman; Pelican Rapids woman; maybe Kennewick Man) and which bear no resemblance to American Indians are turned over to the local tribes for secret burial and are lost to science forever. </p>

&#8220;In 4500 BC, before the invention of writing and before the first cities of Mesopotamia and Egypt were established, Old Europe was among the most sophisticated and technologically advanced regions in the world. The phrase &ldquo;Old Europe&rdquo; refers to a cycle of related cultures that thrived in southeastern Europe during the fifth and fourth millennia BC. The heart of Old Europe was centered in the Danube River&rsquo;s fertile valleys, where agriculturally rich plains were exploited by Neolithic farmers who founded long-lasting settlements &mdash; some of which grew to substantial size, with populations reaching upward of 10,000 people. Today, the intriguing and enigmatic remains of these highly developed cultures can be found at sites that extend from modern-day Serbia to Ukraine. The Lost World of Old Europe: The Danube Valley, 5000â€“3500 BC presents extraordinary finds from the three countries with the richest Old European archaeological heritage &mdash; Bulgaria, the Republic of Moldova, and Romania.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The guy writing the article is way off base.  The craddle of civilzation was in the Middle East.  The first period was about 500,000 years ago.  After about 150,000 years, that advanced civilization with teaching centers to the evolutionary peoples crashed.  Then about 35,000 years ago, a second advanced civilization started up again which was the pre-runner of other advanced cilizations such as Greece, Egypt, Ayrans(in India), Rome and then much later the European civilization of today.  The source of the genetic make-up of these advanced civilizations all came from the Middle East, but not from the Arabs or blacks in that region.  These people were pre-white.  The Caucasian like mummies found in China (the Tarim Basin) are of these people.  These pre-white people fanned out to the far corners of the earth uplifting the genes of the evolutionary people of this planet and creating advanced civilizations whenever they reached a critical mass.  The major amount of these people&rsquo;s superior genes now reside in the so-called white race of today.  To interbreed with inferior genes as the media is currently advocating is pure suicide for this planet.  It is not cool but rather insanity.  </p>

		<p>#2, I just googled the archaeological finds you mentioned, and they led me to the website/organization, Friends of America&rsquo;s Past.  </p>
<p>What is happening to these American discoveries is nothing short of a concerted cover-up.  It totally meshes with the suppression of archaeological finds in China, which also point to an early Caucasoid presence.  As a Native American (Mississippi&rsquo;s founding families usually descend from Jews and Scots who married Indians), I am outraged by this deliberate suppression of scientific discovery.  We should all be outraged.</p>
<p>We should feel lucky, though, that these Danube finds are happening in countries which are (for the time being) resisting the insane anti-European agenda of the EU.  I&rsquo;m sure that the suppression of the Danube finds is being attemped, and that the suppression will eventually prevail.  Let&rsquo;s hope enough of the truth gets out, before that happens.</p>

Sorry, but you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s &#8220;way off base&#8221;.  I studied archaeology in college, and there&rsquo;s virtually NO EVIDENCE in the fossil record to support ANY of your outlandish claims!</p>
<p>500,000 years ago (as far as the fossil record shows) the only &#8220;humans&#8221; around were what are collectively termed today &#8220;archaic Homo sapiens&#8221;.  These creatures didn&rsquo;t possess the intelligence to create simple villages, much less sophisticated civilizations.</p>

<p>35,000 years ago ALL humans on earth were living as hunter-gatherers (and again, NOTHING in the fossil record shows otherwise).</p>

<p><br>
By the way, anthropologists don&rsquo;t use the term &#8220;pre-white&#8221;; they use the term &#8220;proto-Caucasoid&#8221;.</p>

&#8220;The Caucasian like mummies found in China (the Tarim Basin) are of these people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really?  Archaeologists in both China and the West claim they have no idea exactly where the people who produced the Tarim mummies originated, though archaeological artifacts strongly hint the earliest (Caucasoid) settlers came from the Caucasus.</p>

		<p>The culture in question is the Vinca Culture of Serbia, successor of the 7000 BC Lepenski Vir Culture, also of Serbia. Most modern Serbs descend from these pre-Slavic people, whose Y-chromosome haplogroup Ib3 represents 60% of Serb-derived Balkaners in five countries &amp; 1/3 of Scandinavians. E.Europe was the source of Aryan expansion, the Balkans for the Neolithic expansion - both in terms of population &amp; culture. </p>

		<p>To Comment #8, the link is Urantia.org or just type in Urantia Book.  Read the book with an open mind.  Humans nor science do not know everything.  It is the duty of every human being to search for the truth.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the academia works backwards in such findings as this.  They develope theories/hypothesis based on these findings and then try to spin them as facts.  As the sayings goes, the more you pound a lie eventually it becomes truth.  </p>
<p>Also keep in mind, humans do not even know how they got onto this planet.  It is certainly not from some amino acids in some kind of primordial &#8220;soup&#8221; accidently getting together in ages past.  What prevents that from happening again and again from the very first &#8220;happening&#8221;?  This question is absolutely avoided by the so-called scientific community.  Or did they put some forth some silly theory that life conditions were different then or just in that one instance when life began.  The actual truth is that all forms of life evolved from that first instance.  </p>
<p>The debate over evolution and intelligent design is silly.  It is actually both.  Hope you enjoy reading the Urantia Book it goes into great depth on how life came onto this planet!  It will give you a different and more expansive view on life.</p>

		<p>To Comment #9:  Just because no present findings does not equal no other facts!  Pre-white or proto means the same.  Just semantics you are arguing about.  Regarding the Tarim Basin mummies, how about the people in the Caucasus also orginated from the same area as the mummies found in the Tarim Basin?  In other words, these people all originated from the same location which is the Middle East.</p>
<p>Regarding your science versus theosophy and archaeological findings comments, please read my response to Comment #8.  Keep an open mind!  This world and life holds many more secrets yet to be discovered by humans.  </p>

		<p>Readers might find it interesting to compare the spiral artwork to that found in Newgrange, Ireland.  Very similar.</p>

		<p>To Comment #13:  the spiral motiff is also painted on some of the Caucasian like mummies found in the Tarim Basin.  This is so because it is the same people who also fanned out to Europe from the Middle East.  The majority of these migrated to Europe possessing the most advanced genes on this planet.  </p>
<p>This same spiral motiff is found thoroughout in the Greek civilization.  The meaning in my opinion is that it symbolizes the Milky Way which is the capital of this Universe.  Those Tarim Basin mummies had that spiral motiff painted on them to symbolize going back to their place of origin in the universe.</p>
