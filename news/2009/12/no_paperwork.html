<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why the White House is so upset about the two party crashers at Barack Obama&rsquo;s steak dinner the other night.</p>
<p>Is it really appropriate and politically correct to call them party crashers just because they trespassed on Mr. Obama? Does that make them criminals? Isn&rsquo;t that discrimination? Shouldn&rsquo;t they be rewarded for such bold and brave behavior? Maybe they were just trying to feed their family?</p>
<p>I would suggest that it&rsquo;s more appropriate to call them &#8220;undocumented guests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just because they weren&rsquo;t officially invited doesn&rsquo;t mean they should be treated like criminals. Maybe they should get free health care, free housing, free legal services and free White House green cards so next time they can enter legally. And they should be able to bring all of their relatives and family members, too.</p>
<p>How can Mr. Obama be mad at them just because they crossed over some arbitrary man-made border? They were there only to do the things that regularly invited guests didn&rsquo;t want to do. (Like hang out with Joe Biden.)</p>
<p>How can the White House punish these poor oppressed undocumented visitors?<br>

<p>Great point!  So, they just didn&rsquo;t have the proper paperwork. Who cares?  Big deal.  Nobody else does these days.   Why should they be singled out?  This is obvious discrimination!  And by the way, the Secret Service had some nerve to ask about their status.  That&rsquo;s offensive!  Somebody should be fired.</p>

<p>Hats off to Mr. Shoemake, this is a very clever bit of writing.</p>
<p>Indeed, Tareq and Michaele Salahi certainly meant no harm here, but the Marxstream Media and the mulatto &ldquo;savior&rdquo; seem to be crazed with the idea of punishing them. This is strange, since isn&rsquo;t the White House really the People&rsquo;s House and should be open to all anyway? </p>
<p>In a world &ldquo;without borders&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t they be congratulated and not condemned!</p>

		<p>How far we&rsquo;ve come since Calvin Coolidge used to sit on the White House steps on Sunday mornings (unsurrounded by Secret Service agents( and greet anybody who wanted to come and shake his hand and tell him whatever was on his mind.</p>
<p>The notion that POTUS is so important to the nation that he must be protected from any conceivable threat at all cost is relatively recent and indicates perhaps better than anything else how this nation has come to look to government as the most indispensible force in their lives.  It reveals a sickness in the American soul, and the bizarre hysteria over two harmless party crashers illustrates this as perhaps nothing else could.</p>

		<p>The only reason why fencing was originally put around the White House grounds was to keep cows penned in.  And it wasn&rsquo;t until about America&rsquo;s involvement in WWII that an ordinary person wasn&rsquo;t able to go right up to the WH as if he were visiting a relative.</p>
<p>As far as the &#8220;party crashers,&#8221; I think someone on the WH staff invited them accidentally, when Obama or Rahm or Axelrod didn&rsquo;t want them there.  Their links to Palestinian terrorists would create too much controversy, so Obama/Rahm/Axelrod/MSM have to spin this as a matter of &#8220;uninvited guests.&#8221;  These &#8220;uninvited guests&#8221; were certainly welcomed by Joe Biden!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s so true!  They were just seeking a better life for themselves.  Why does Obama want to deny them the chance for advancement?   &mdash;   Why does he want to keep them down?</p>
<p>Also, they have a right to be there, because that land where the so-called &#8220;White House&#8221; sits was stolen from the Native Americans.  No selfish elitist can claim the earth as their sole property   &mdash;   it belongs to all the people.</p>
<p>Finally, it is racist to call it the &#8220;White&#8221; house?  Why not the People&rsquo;s House, or the People of Color&rsquo;s House?  </p>

<p>ALSO! despite the attempts of our U.S. government to oust Fidel Castro in Cuba, apparently our government is the only people trying to kill him and he shops by himself in the open markets and greets people and shakes hands..When was the last time an American president dared do that without an attempt on his life?</p>

		<p>In many of the comments that accompanied the story when it first broke, people demanded that &#8220;heads roll&rsquo;, because of what they thought was the most despicable breach of security by the Secret Service since John Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination. Theses same people, who had no problem with the attempted assassination of Reagan, were foaming at the mouth about these party crashers.</p>

		<p>This entire episode is being handled in a manner that is almost jocular and should not be?</p>
<p>The President during a time when our nation is at war with a hostile foreign power must be carefully guarded no matter what. A person or persons such as this pair could and did have easily gotten within reach with ceramic knifes, undetectable by the metal detectors, or had explosives concealed and not found unless a full body pat down was done. Secret Service fell flat on their face, and I fear because the White House has told them to do so!!</p>

		<p>I despise Obama to the point that I think our country should seriously consider first de-funding and then dismantling the entire federal government&hellip;.it has become a joke at best and tyranical at worst.</p>
<p>But this incident concerns me greatly.  It shows that Obama isn&rsquo;t just incompetent as President.  His entire administration, in even the littlest things can&rsquo;t get the job done.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s life is in danger from this.  These &#8220;guests&#8221; could easily have been assassins.  Assassination of an American President should be INCREDIBLY difficult and, for all previous Presidents, mostly was.  Not so, with Obama, the entire world got a glimpse of.  Ever wacko from the Watts to Saudi Arabia is looking at this and starting to get ideas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very bad thing.</p>

		<p>Plus they, the &#8220;crashers&#8221;, are a multiracial couple; he&rsquo;s from Iran, she&rsquo;s an all american blonde. And they play polo. Indeed, they mingle in social classes above the photoop, black trash Obamas.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, a mentally disturbed English boy sat in his bedroom and used his home PC, an American search engine and American software to connect into the pentagon, by-passing billions of dollars worth of hi-tech American military security firewalls and upsetting the much vaunted American &#8216;intelligence&rsquo; apparatus. Our cursed, weak, ineffectual so-called government in UK permits this travesty of extradition law and will allow a prejudiced USA justice system to &#8216;try&rsquo; one of our English citizens having already publicly declared him guilty before the trial and guaranteeing he will spend many years in prison. Perhaps the boy should have gone really high-tech and, using a wire coat-hanger, two elastic bands and a few yogurt cups, sank the entire US navy. During his enforced stay in your country, perhaps he could offer advice on fixing your leaky southern border and White House security, both problems having proved too intellectually taxing to solve hitherto. Having proved his worth with about six hundred bucks worth of well-used home computer gear, think what he could do with the latest sat-nav fitted into an old chevy impala.</p>

<p>Anonymous #5  &mdash;  Are you serious or being sarcastic?  I&rsquo;m part Amerind myself, albeit a small part, but I&rsquo;m open to hearing &#8220;both&#8221; sides of history.  Were the Natives robbed or just conquered?  History, they say, is written by the winner.</p>
<p>The White House, BTW, was named after some guy named White.  I think it used to be called the Executive Mansion.</p>

Well, perhaps, but to be fair there have been an awful lot of presidential assassinations and attempts over the years. And every time some nut takes a potshot at a prez, the level of security around the top man gets stepped up. Whatever the big guy&rsquo;s bodyguards had been doing <i>last</i> time somebody got in too close, I would imagine the team learns from their mistake, close that loophole, change their routine so that can&rsquo;t ever happen again. This gets added to the existing repertoire of protocol, procedure and &#8220;best practises&#8221;   &mdash;   which by the year 2009 has probably grown to an extremely long list! By now they must have every possible angle covered in every possible scenario a president might find himself in. </p>
<p>It could well be that presidential security has been pretty much perfected. The last malevolent attempt of any seriousness I can recall was Hinckley&rsquo;s wacky lunge at Reagan in &#8216;81. The fact that we&rsquo;ve gone 28 years without an incident (in a country with lots and lots and lots of guns) suggests that WH security strategy and tech have evolved to where they&rsquo;re virtually impregnable. </p>
<p>Which is, of course, a good thing for our nation. I&rsquo;m no fan of Obama, but assassinations are ALWAYS disruptive and hurtful and harmful to a nation; and so are to be avoided at all costs. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that, although letting in these two crashers certainly represents a security lapse on <i>somebody&rsquo;s</i> part, the prez himself might have been well protected at all times and therefore invulnerable even if these &#8220;undocumented guests&#8221; had really intended harm to Dr. Utopia. </p>
<p>Although they did get to Biden&hellip;</p>
