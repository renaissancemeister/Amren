<h1>Police Investigate Somali Attacks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark LaFlamme, Sun Journal (Lewiston, Maine), December 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Throughout the summer, similar reports have come into the Police Department. Witnesses and investigators say swarms of Somali boys, some as young as 8, others in their late teens, overwhelm solitary victims through sheer numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not gang activity in the traditional sense,&#8221; Deputy Chief James Minkowsky said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not seeing the colors or the monikers, but it&rsquo;s still a gang mentality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Often, these gang members carry sticks and rocks with which to intimidate their victims. There are often four or five of them, sometimes as many as a dozen. Typically, they threaten or beat their victims until they give up the goods: money, bicycles, cell phones, prescription drugs, or other items of value.</p>
<p>Then they scatter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The attacks continued all summer; more than a dozen were reported to police. There were more in the fall and a series of them in recent weeks. In each attack, the victim is one who may have appeared weak to the group that descended on them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the first day of December, a man walking through Kennedy Park after leaving a Park Street club said he was attacked by four Somali males. The group came at him from behind, knocked him down and stole prescription drugs and $150 in cash. That man told police it was the second time he was attacked in such a fashion. The first time, he was able to escape.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In late summer, an off-duty civilian police employee was eating at a local restaurant. A local boy ran to the window, screaming for help. The police employee ran outside and found a group  &mdash;  roughly a half-dozen  &mdash;  of Somali boys. When confronted, they ran off.</p>
<p>Police say they are investigating the attacks on several fronts. They are using new technology and new techniques. A bigger break came in recent weeks when they were approached by a group that wants to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Members of the Somali community came to us,&#8221; Minkowsky says. &#8220;They set up a meeting with us and came in to talk about it. They want to help us combat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stephen Wessler, director of the Center for the Prevention of Hate Violence, said he was not aware of the Somali assaults in Lewiston. After hearing the nature of them, he said the attacks likely were not the type that involve his group. The motive appears to be robbery, rather than race.</p>
<p>While investigating the ambush-style attacks, police have little to compare them with, at least locally. A search of assaults dating back to spring revealed no incidents of a similar nature involving non-Somalis.</p>

		<p>How is this not &#8220;traditional gang violence?&#8221;  The only way it&rsquo;s not is that they use sticks and rocks, but that&rsquo;s only because that&rsquo;s all they know.  Give them five years, and they&rsquo;ll be using guns.</p>

<p>I can almost predict how this went. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t press charges against these confused kids because they come from an impoverished background, and that would devastate them&#8221;. What a joke. I would sue the city, sue the state, obtain a CCW (in neighboring Vermont, you only have to buy the gun and don&rsquo;t even need a class to obtain a CCW), and take shooting lessons, and travel with more than just yourself. If you are alone, don&rsquo;t leave home without the pistol. Better safe than sorry. </p>

		<p>I remember when there was quite an uproar about the first groups of Somalis relocating to Maine, and the politicians and police chiefs denigrated anyone warning about crime and violence as racists.</p>
<p>Well, who was right?  And who is paying for it now?  </p>
<p>How these white fools can be so blind as to dangers of non-white inhabitants is really beyond me.  It&rsquo;s difficult for me to understand anyone who is so dense and just plain blind to reality.</p>
<p>And, just listen to them talk about the situation.  They&rsquo;re outlining things they can do to improve the situation.</p>
<p>How about doing as we said, you poor dupes, and refuse to accept them when they show up?  You got what you deserved, and it only gets worse from here on out.</p>
<p>Do gooder whites have destroyed this country.</p>

		<p>Every police department that has Somalis under its jurisdiction should familiarize itself with this primitive, aggressive culture.</p>
<p>They are products of the harsh East African desert.  The families are clannish and loyal to each other in a way that would put the Sicilian mafia to shame. The males travel in packs, and have little respect for the laws of the whites.  </p>
<p>They come to the West to loot us, nothing more. They are often on welfare, and the mothers will live apart in subsidized or free housing provided by the state.  </p>
<p>The husband and wife will declare the couple separated, while continuing to be secretly married under sharia Islamic law.  They are prolific breeders, and often keep their polygamous marriages secret by claiming that several wives living under one roof with lots of kids are all &#8216;single&rsquo; and distantly related (often true, as they marry within the clans).</p>
<p>They are ruthless hunter-gatherers, loose in a land of white people who mostly have no clue that they&rsquo;re dealing with a completely alien culture. </p>

		<p>This is one time I really don&rsquo;t think these are &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;, it is just them doing what they do best and the Whites are the ones with things they want. Hold the Churchs that brought them there be held responsible for all damages.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s happening in Lewiston, Maine now, and who will be next? Somalis are all over the developed countries these days - America, Canada, western Europe, and Australia. And you can bet they&rsquo;ll head to wherever the weather happens to be cool. As I say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wherever there is frost, cold, ice, and snow,<br>
To those locales be assured that Somalis will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s because Somalis know that whites create prosperous societies, will bend over backwards to avoid accusations of &#8216;racism&rsquo;, and are just darned easy to take advantage of.<br>

		<p>Somehow I have the idea that what the local cops in Lewiston want most for Xmas is to never have to arrest a Somali. They are dealing with people with the hunting instincts of a hyena. The Somalis have been air-dropped into an environment with few competitors and lots of prey. </p>

		<p>From the full article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Later that night, a woman in her late 60s was beaten by a group of Somali boys and relieved of cash while walking in Kennedy Park&hellip;Five nights later, another man was jumped by a group of similar description. He resisted the gang and was beaten badly. He required surgery.</p>
<p>Deputy Chief James Minkowsky said, &rsquo; In some cases, they seem to do it for the thrill of it&hellip;. many of the suspects had dropped out of school.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Newsweek&rsquo;s take on Lewiston:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;The Refugees Who Saved Lewiston: A dying Maine mill town gets a fresh burst of energy.&rsquo;  The article quotes Morrison and Paul Badeau, marketing director for the Lewiston-Auburn Economic Growth Council, in a story that credits the city&rsquo;s new Somali residents for its economic rebirth.</p>
<p>&#8216;We&rsquo;ve welcomed the Somalis and worked every day to help make them a part of our community!&rsquo; Morrison said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2006, the Maine Department of Labor says the unemployment rate among Somalis in Lewiston was 51%.  The jobless rate in Maine at that time was 6.2%.</p>
<p>Refugee Resettlement Watch reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Census bureau estimates show that between 2000 and 2008 the &#8216;Black or African American&rsquo; population of Lewiston exploded by 615% to roughly 2,700&hellip; the town&rsquo;s white population is down about 13% during the same period.</p>
<p> 83,991 Somali Shariah-supporting immigrants have been admitted to the US in 25 years.   More than half, 43,682, came since September 11th. </p>
<p>African resettlement was not a priority until, according to a report by Heidi Boas the Congressional Black Caucus got involved&hellip;. in her lengthy 2007 paper entitled, &#8216;The New Face of America&rsquo;s Refugees: African Refugee Resettlement to the United States:&rsquo;  </p>
<p>Several of the individuals interviewed for this paper identified the Congressional black Caucus as one of the most influential groups advocating over the past decade for increased African refugee resettlement to the United States&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>From the Refugee Watch Fact Sheet:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;For the first 30 days the refugees are funded with an $850 per family gift from the State Department. At 30 days they are eligible for all forms of welfare. </p>
<p>A newly arriving refugee aged 65 can immediately retire on SSI/Medicaid never having worked a day in the U.S&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yzofyfx" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yzofyfx</a></p>
<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t enrage WHITE NATIVE BORN AMERICANS I don&rsquo;t know what will.  </p>
<p>It seems it&rsquo;s possible for states to opt out of being forced to take in refugees, as has Wyoming. This country is going to increasingly Balcanize and break up along racial lines  &mdash;  I say the sooner the better.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been called a mean-spirited SOB on AmRen before for saying that the sanctimonious doubleplusgoodthinkful - bien-pensant - Swedes deserve all the misery their insane - and suicidal - immigration policy has brought to their homeland [this was many years after the Swedes had done all they could to hasten the joyous advent of &#8216;majority rule&rsquo; in Rhodesia and South Africa] and my immediate reaction to this appalling tale is a mirthless chuckle.</p>

		<p>What makes life as a human valuable? Is it being an individual as much as possible along with the rights and responsibilities? Or is it everyone helping/interfereing with everyone elses life? Either humans admire the loss of their individuality by immersing themselves in groups or take pride in their self reliance and individuality. Of course individuals have friends and family, but the emphasis is being your own person ..not a clone. The point I&rsquo;m getting to is that Charity&hellip; Although a big infatuation amongst religion&hellip; is in my opinion, kind of a false idol. Under severe conditions it is the only just behavior &hellip; a car accident or other emergency&hellip;of course its the only human thing to do&hellip; but these busy bodys that are ever trapsing the world with *good* ideas&hellip;*OH so Helpful* by relocating others or organising money to go here or there&hellip; Doesn&rsquo;t this undermine accountability as well as a realistic understanding of which end of the stick is up&hellip;self realization? If a person feels &#8220;charitable&#8221; perhaps they might want to quietly immerse themselves in it in a way that doesn&rsquo;t violate the rights of others. Marxism was completely based on charitable emotions&hellip;everyone MUST SHARE and be the same.</p>

		<p>Earlier immigrants to the U.S. came from European countries where law and order prevailed in the country of origin. If anything the new settlers found more freedom here than existed back home in the old country. </p>
<p>Trying to bring people here from parts of the world where law and order does not exist is something new and something our ancestors would never have contemplated. There is no way that 19th century Americans would have rounded up a wild tribe from the Western states and turned them loose on an Eastern city in the hope they would become civilized and start to obey the white man&rsquo;s laws. </p>
<p>This probably isn&rsquo;t just a racial problem it&rsquo;s more one of the clash of cultures. If Americans, even black Americans, don&rsquo;t want to go live in Somolia what makes anyone think it&rsquo;s a good idea to have Somalians living here? </p>

		<p>My greatest immediate fear about these primitives is that they might at least have the animal cunning to grasp that attacking your host immediately is short-sighted.  I worried that they would wait until they&rsquo;ve been worked into the Gorgeous Mosaic and become an accepted part of the Vibrant Community, before pulling off the mask.  But it seems they have no masks, that their savagery cannot be contained.  This is good.  The sooner a cancer is recognized, the sooner it can be cut out and tossed into the bio-waste can.  </p>

		<p>Sounds very familiar indeed.  Upstate NY and in particular the Albany-Schenectady-Troy area is seeing an influx of those from Guyana.  I was showing some of the lost areas of Schenectady to my wife&hellip;shops ans restaurants of my youth and very historical places like the Stockade area with homes dating back to the late 1600s.  I thought we would be safe on the streets but I was wrong.  After 4 individuals attempted to rob us, I engaged in hand to hand as best I could with anything available as a potential weapon.  Needless to say since I&rsquo;m still in the Army, basic combative training was still on the mental back burner and 3 of the 4 were knocked out with the 4th escaping covered in blood.  The remaining 3 all had broken fingers, broken ribs and broken noses with 2 getting really painful dislocated shoulders.  I was almost charged with excessive force in defending myself and my wife.  I&rsquo;m ready for a Whitopia, walled in if necessary but completely defended.</p>

		<p>Not a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, but you can bet that if someone who objects to being beaten with clubs were to actually shoot and kill his Somali attackers, he would be facing hate crime charges right away, charges that would be eventually dropped, but only after he had been bankrupted with legal fees.</p>

		<p>The question has been brought up, but not, as far as I can see, answered; exactly who encouraged/expedited the influx of Somalis into Lewiston? Was it a particular industry, or a particular religious organization? One poster said that the Somalis targeted Lewiston because of welfare, etc., but there had to be some type of liason. <br>
 If it was a local entity that facilitated it, I think that the obvious thing for the citizens of lewiston to do is really crank up the political heat on whoever is responsible.<br>
 Also, Michael/26 brings up a very good point. If a citizen defends him or herself against these goblins, it is unforgivable for the citizenry to stand by and let that person be ruined by the &#8220;system&#8221; for defending himself. Establish and donate to a defense fund, and organize to turn up the political heat on the legal system. This kind of thing happens to us because we hunker down and don&rsquo;t vent our righteous anger. </p>

		<p>i remember reading a few years ago about these violent heathens being relocated to peaceful, white small community of lewiston, maine. being from the deep south and living here all my 57 years, i am all to familiar with the behavior of blacks.<br>
i also remember being baffled by the &#8221;welcoming committees&#8221; that were organized by naive, wide-eyed liberals, no doubt not knowing what they were getting themselves into. <br>
i further remember how there were a few yanks up there in them northern woods who thought it wasn&rsquo;t such a good idea. why invite trouble.<br>
these are the same murderous thugs who attacks and pirate mostly cargo ships - many from western countries bringing food and medicine into somalia - who must make the trip around the horn of africa. <br>
there is no real governmennt in somalia and the economy itself it based on the &#8221;profits&#8221; of piracy. they have proven to be human parasites every opportunity they get.</p>
<p>i have the same question as another poster on this thread&hellip;.who the heck was stupid enough not to predict the danger of bringing these loosers to a sleepy, quiet and successful white enclave.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be willing to bet that if they could, these former &#8221;do-gooder&#8221; liberals would opt to show them the door as quickly as they were to roll out the welcome mat a few years ago.</p>

		<p>Here are two links at Refugee Resettlement Watch that will give you some background on how we came to resettle so many Somalis and how such a large number ended up in Maine:<br>

		<p>Having watched the newscasts of this area, every Friday and Saturday night plus Sunday days, from June to September, there was not ONE mention of this.  There was a small mention (one night; 30 seconds) of a small(@30ish)riot of Somalis protesting one of theirs being shot by a cop.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Members of the Somali community came to us,&rdquo; &hellip; They want to help us combat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These Somali KNOW exactly who the perps are and KNOW so from the start. And are going to WANT stuff. A new center, money for the center, classes, workshops, money for same, etc. Give them something and this will all stop. Of course.</p>
<p> &#8220;the attacks likely were not the type that involve his group. The motive appears to be robbery, rather than race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each and every time the attackers are Somali and attack whites? Each and every time? Is there an instance of Somali doing the same to other Somali? What else is this than racial?</p>
<p>This is the predator animal feeling out the prey. Seeing what can be done and what cannot be. Getting an instinct of how to attack, when, who, etc. What is the response or lack thereof.</p>
<p>As goes Maine, so goes the nation is the adage. We all know where that is going to be. The direction is not good.</p>

		<p>It should be interesting and a bit entertaining to see what the high water mark will be for whites before they have a racial awakening in regards to black on white violence/crime.</p>

		<p>In a town of 12,000 you can bet that every memeber of the white population at large already knows all about these attacks.  I eagerly await news of revenge attacks, which will of course be dubbed &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had to guts to throw a pig&rsquo;s head at the doorstep of a somali mosque, surely they have the guts to defend themselves.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t blame Lewiston. The Somalis were brought to Maine by Catholic Charities.  Of course having a socialist Governor as a cheerleader didn&rsquo;t help matters. People from Lewiston hated the Somalis but there was nothing they could do about it.  Those that tried were labled as bigots and charged with hate crimes.  Catholic Charities also brought tons of Somalis and Sudanese to Portland Maine.  Both towns are now reaching &#8220;critical mass&#8221; and crime is exploding.  The people that work for a living are always outvoted by the &#8220;limosine liberals&#8221;, indoctrinated college students, ignorant do-gooders and people who don&rsquo;t have to live around them.  </p>

		<p>  Isn&rsquo;t it strange that &#8220;Catholic charities&#8221; are bringing Muslim Somalis to Lewiston Maine? Shouldn&rsquo;t they be looking after their own flock? </p>

		<p>Welcome to liberal Utopia.  The Somali &#8220;leaders&#8221; want to resolve this problem&hellip; all they need is some more money and nicer houses to be given to the blacks so that their self-respect is better&hellip;. and the white people have so much anyway&hellip;. <br>

		<p>This should all be so simple, really.   This would never be happening in the first place, if they had never been brought there. </p>
<p>All of this was foreseeable.  It was predicted right here on Amren.</p>
