<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/nyregion/26vote.html?_r=1">For First Time, Minority Vote Was a Majority</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Roberts, New York Times, December 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Much of the focus on the results of last month&rsquo;s New York City elections was on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg&rsquo;s small victory margin, despite the more than $102 million he spent to secure a third term. But the elections also produced a seismic political shift that so far has gone largely unnoticed: Black, Hispanic and Asian residents made up a majority of voters in a citywide race for the first time.</p>
<p>That turnout is a milestone in a city where minority groups make up both a majority of the population and a majority of those eligible to vote. The transformation of the electorate also signals the growing political importance of the city&rsquo;s diverse tapestry and the challenges that citywide candidates will face as they strive to stitch together successful voting blocs.</p>

		<p>I have been trying to determine how best to short the municiple bonds issued by New York and California. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until they both default on their debt obligations and sink deeper in the sewage abyss. It would be even better to purchase naked puts on those, if such instruments exist.</p>
<p>America is just a sewer now. Short it and turn your lemons into lemonade.<br>

		<p>What this &#8220;signals&#8221; is the extant to which New York City is going to turn into the parody, &#8220;Escape from New York&#8221;.  From the premise of a funny movie, this is fast becoming the probably solution to a horrible social problem.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;In November&rsquo;s election, 46 percent of the voters identified themselves as white, 23 percent as black, 21 percent as Hispanic and 7 percent as Asian, according to exit polls by Edison Media Research.&rdquo; (From the original article)</p>
<p>Well, diversity marches on!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it just grand, living in such magnificently transformative times?</p>
<p>Considering that the wishy-washy Commissar of New York City, Comrade Bloomberg, actually won this election, it would be interesting to see what percentage of the white vote that he got. I bet it was about 67% to 75% of it at least; were it lower, he would be out of a job and wondering what else he might have blown over $102 million on. Also, it would be interesting to know just how cravenly he pandered to nonwhites in his campaign and what percentage of that vote he got; I bet is wasn&rsquo;t more than 8% to 10%?</p>
<p>In the end, he learns an expensive lesson that El Presidente Bush learned between 2000 and 2004; as a white Republican, you have only one voting demographic that can be counted on, your &ldquo;fellow&rdquo; whites. Even when you have given them the shaft, your biggest problem is hoping they vote for sub-adequate self-interests (as opposed to genuine self- interests) and do not just stay at home. If that isn&rsquo;t instructive, perhaps a talk Comrade Senator John McCretin about 2008, might clarify the issue.</p>
<p>Of course, given that fool&rsquo;s antics lately, that is a highly academic question.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Well folks, you have understand why Mayor Bloomberg won. He was desperately trying to make sure he could stay in office because he&rsquo;s worried about New York&rsquo;s golf courses. He appealed to minority voters because of this. I&rsquo;m not kidding. Mayor Mike said so himself. &#8220;If illegal aliens are deported from New York, he told one group of concerned citizens, &#8221; who will take care of the golf courses&#8221;. The Mayors faith in European Americans, seems sadly lacking. Oh well, now with the re-election of Mayor Mike, at least the greens will be saved. And some people think politicians are useless.</p>

		<p>In a country that was 90 percent white in the last century.  </p>
<p>Before anyone gets the &#8216;wrong&rsquo; idea, the writer carefully sounds the right politically correct note, noting positively the &#8216;diverse tapestry&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Mainstream media writers live in fear of deviating from approved messages.  Any hint of alarm at this sudden racial replacement would raise eyebrows in the editorial suite, so the boilerplate celebratory &#8216;diverse tapestry&rsquo; accompanies the statistical information and provides the narrative.</p>

		<p>When acquaintances chastise me about my pro white views I tell them they have nothing to worry about.  There are no pro white candidates for public office, nor any organization of any size, nor any media that could mobilize for one. </p>
<p>(In all honesty at this point their eyes glaze over and I am sure they are daydreaming about the next big episode on TV, or getting laid, or making a credit card payment.  But I continue as if they were really interested in my answer to their verbally expressed fear.)</p>
<p>Continuing&hellip;</p>
<p>So you have nothing to worry about.  The Mexicans will continue to come into the country by the millions, the Chinese too.  The Blacks will keep getting their affirmative action and food stamps.  There will be no white renaissance.  </p>
<p>So, see, everything is perfect in your world.  <br>
How do you like it? </p>

		<p>White turnout was suppressed because most whites are nauseated by the billionaire mayor, Michael Bloomberg, while black and hispanics turned out in unusually high greater numbers because of a black challenger Bill Thompson.</p>

		<p>Taken as a group, yes, all of the traditional races/ethnicities may indeed be considered some kind of majority; eventually.  But none of the &#8216;typical&rsquo; minority groups (Blacks, Latin Americans, Asians) want anything to do with each other wherever they have a stronghold in either power or nominal numbers.</p>
<p>So, as much as the media loves to wax poetic about the day when Whites will no longer be a majority, it has to be taken with a grain of salt.  </p>
<p>If any one of these minorities ever becomes a singular majority, you can bet that all of the other minority groups will cease to exist.</p>
<p>Personally, if it can&rsquo;t be us, I&rsquo;d take the Asians (North Asians specifically).  Japanese, Chinese and Koreans have zero tolerance for deviant Blacks and Non-White Hispanics.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In NYC most of the white voters are liberals who are getting what they deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong. The whites who got it in the neck over immigration in NY were the white working people from the outer boroughs. We were NEVER liberal. Most were old line Democrats who went overwhelmingly for Reagan in the &rsquo;80s. It&rsquo;s no accident that &#8220;All in the Family&#8221; was set in Queens. Norman Lear was mocking the real Archie Bunkers who lived there at one time, their patriotism, their work ethic and their overall Americaness. We are now mostly gone from the city so the observation about liberal New Yorkers is pretty much true of the remaining white &#8216;strong-hold&rsquo; (ahem&hellip;), Manhattan. There the rich and rich wannabee elites live pretty much free of what they made us endure in Brooklyn, Queens etc., beginning in 1993 with Doris Meissners overnight tripling of legal immigration from the third world.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the thing that galls me the most. Before the &rsquo;80s even parts of Manhattan had a white middle-class and though we&rsquo;ve always had a normal share of liberals for any big city we were never, in the majority white population, a ultra-liberal bastion, except for places like the West Village (not even the East Village as much, which even back then still had pockets of Ukrainians, Italians and the like). Then Ed Koch opened the real-estate development floodgates and we got inundated with millions of yuppies </p>

Then Ed Koch opened the real-estate development floodgates and we got inundated with millions of yuppies FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. With these came all those liberals that didn&rsquo;t want to live in the now-called red states who then proceeded to make the place over in their image. Once, of course, they got rid of all those pesky, backward Archie Bunker types.</p>
<p>So the rest of the country sent over it&rsquo;s libs, who then drove the real New Yorkers out, and then people from Oklahoma or Wisconson sneer at us for being too liberal. Neat trick. Walk anywhere on the Upper East Side and take a survey on where the residents originally came from. Not a lot of born-and-breds, except for Jewish people.</p>
<p>But what bothers me the most about posts like Follow the Light is the devil-may-care attitude about other whites. The whites who lived in NY, who built and maintained the neighborhoods did nothing to &#8216;deserve&rsquo; what they got. As I said, the real culprits were insulated. Even the deluded liberals who really believed the multicult tripe are still white and carry our genetic and cultural heritage and every effort should be made to wake them up. I for one do not agree that we should write off entire sections of any white country. Whatever it takes we should make every effort to reclaim all of it. Nostalgia apart, places like New York,a valuable port, are assets built up over the years that we should never just hand over to third world throngs. Even Detroit should be reclaimed. Because if we don&rsquo;t then the Chinese most certainly will.<br>
