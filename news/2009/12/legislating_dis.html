<h1>Legislating Discrimination</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hans A. von Spakovsky, National Review Online, December 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What&rsquo;s the worst bill ever seriously considered for passage by the U.S. Congress? Certainly both the House health-reform bill and Sen. Harry Reid&rsquo;s health bill are leading contenders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Within the last three months, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has twice sent letters to the president and the leaders of the House and Senate warning them of discriminatory provisions in both bills. But those warnings have been ignored, and the problems remain.</p>
<p>Take Reid&rsquo;s bill. It directs the secretary of health and human services to award federal grants worth billions of dollars to educational institutions that train medical-service providers. However, &#8220;priority&#8221; for federal dollars is to be given only to those institutions offering &#8220;preferential&#8221; admissions to underrepresented minorities (according to race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, and religion, depending on which section of the bill you look at). Thus, schools will be unable to compete for essential federal funding unless they adopt admission policies that intentionally and deliberately discriminate. It guarantees the institution of racist and sexist quotas sanctioned and encouraged by the federal government in what Linda Chavez of the Center for Equal Opportunity correctly calls &#8220;a new racial spoils system.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill also declares that institutions training social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, behavioral pediatricians, psychiatric nurses, and counselors will be ineligible for federal grants unless they discriminate. According to Section 756, these programs must enroll &#8220;individuals and groups from different racial, ethnic, cultural, geographic, religious, linguistic, and class backgrounds, and different genders and sexual orientations&#8221; and demonstrate &#8220;knowledge and understanding of the concerns of the[se] individuals and groups.&#8221; If the schools fail to abide by these requirements, they will be liable for &#8220;liquidated damages.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Senate bill even creates a federally funded and administered medical school called the United States Public Health Services Track to &#8220;grant appropriate advanced degrees.&#8221; Priority in admissions is to be given to &#8220;students from rural communities and underrepresented minorities.&#8221; (&#8220;Underrepresented minorities&#8221; is liberal code for &#8220;Asians need not apply.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Naturally, other sections of the bill require lots of data collection regarding race, ethnicity, sex, and so on. Those data will be used to implement quotas of all kinds and put providers at risk of being sued. For example, the data will help trial lawyers pursue &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; cases against physicians and hospitals  &mdash;  even if the differing health outcomes of patients have nothing to do with actual discriminatory treatment by providers. One provision even requires the secretary of health and human services to consult with &#8220;representatives of racial and ethnic minorities&#8221; about the content of promotional labels or print ads for drugs. Racial politics is poised to trump scientific accuracy in drug labeling.</p>
<p>In general, the bill reflects two articles of faith prevalent on the left: (1) that discrimination is perfectly acceptable when practiced in favor of certain minority groups; and (2) that racial disparities in health outcomes arise because doctors and patients don&rsquo;t have the same racial or ethnic or cultural background. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} For blacks, disparities also emerge because, in the words of the Civil Rights Commission, &#8220;as a population, black patients use different doctors, clinics and hospitals than white patients.&#8221; Unfortunately, &#8220;the doctors who treat black patients .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are less likely to be highly credentialed.&#8221; One study found that &#8220;blacks tend to live in parts of the country that have a disproportionate share of low-quality providers.&#8221; At those hospitals, &#8220;both whites and blacks tend to receive low-quality care, but since blacks are overrepresented in such areas, the quality of the hospital will cause an overstatement of the role that race plays.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Unfortunately, the Democrats&rsquo; health-care legislation will force medical institutions to hire based on race and sex, not qualifications, and to lower their admission standards, which will lead to even more &#8220;low-quality&#8221; doctors. Medical students admitted based on lower qualifications generally perform more poorly on licensing exams.</p>
<p>Race-based admissions end up endangering patients  &mdash;  such as those treated by Patrick Chavis, one of whom bled to death due to Chavis&rsquo;s medical malpractice. Chavis was the black applicant admitted to the University of California at Davis Medical School even though he had much weaker academic qualifications than Allan Bakke, a white applicant who was rejected from the school and subsequently was the plaintiff in a famous Supreme Court case. Chavis eventually lost his medical license because of his gross negligence, incompetence, and &#8220;inability to perform some of the most basic duties required of a physician.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There is only one way for health care providers to avoid all these lawsuits.  The regular poster &#8220;White Nurse&#8221; has told us what that is   &mdash;   deliberate denial of health care, especially transplants, major surgeries, geriatric care, residential care, and a few other things, to whites.  This is all a setup for a roundabout death panel to clear whites out of the way and eliminate the electoral risk to Democrats.</p>

I said this was going to happen.</p>
<p>I knew all the &#8216;at risk&rsquo; and &#8216;under served&rsquo; were going to move to the head of the line; and that includes illegal aliens (mark my words).</p>
<p>When Americans wake up to what&rsquo;s going on, it will be too late. The country is going to be the emergency room to the world.</p>
<p>America has no idea what&rsquo;s coming.</p>

		<p>Through the anti-white Kenyan bigot in the White House, post-1965 asians,muslims,hispanics,blacks and africans are waging vicious race war against NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>I oppose an immigration moratorium. I support a complete shut down of all non white LEGAL IMMIGRATION forever.</p>
<p>LEGAL IMMIGRATION has given millions of post-1965 non-whites the right to vote for the complete race-replacement of the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN population. It would be the first time in human history that something like this has ever happened.</p>
<p>Sports Entertainment is complete brain rot..rotting right to the core.</p>

		<p>&#8220;However, &ldquo;priority&rdquo; for federal dollars is to be given only to those institutions offering &ldquo;preferential&rdquo; admissions to underrepresented minorities (according to race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, and religion, depending on which section of the bill you look at).&#8221;</p>
<p>This info has been known for months now, and it is Obama&rsquo;s way of qualifying blacks for positions they cannot earn on their own.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other way blacks would succeed in achieving professional positions and/or succeeding in them unless they are given preferences and awarded entry, grades and certification.</p>
<p>The community organizer knew this from years of watching blacks strike out, so he devised this scheme to get around the problem by invoking a plan that would install the most criminal AA system the country could ever have.  He&rsquo;s using these health care bills, cap and trade, etc., to get it all done.</p>
<p>The man was, as I mentioned many times before:  A black community organizer who has spent twenty years scheming of ways to squeeze blacks into mainstream professions without their having to earn anything, because they can&rsquo;t, and he is not going to change his master plan just because he was elected pres.  It is in that office he can be a more effective community organizer.</p>
<p>Again, let me say that everything this man does domestically is designed to help blacks somehow and if anyone else benefits by it it&rsquo;s strictly an unintended consequence.</p>
<p>Complete economic collapse would be a gift from heaven for us.  It would stop him cold in his tracks, and rid the country of many non-whites, because of a lack of jobs.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s not the half of it, perhaps not even the important half. Every learning institution in the country will also be teaching that it is non-whites who are being discriminated against and that discrimination is the ultimate evil, which again means whites. </p>

		<p>Republicans do not have the guts to question this or to even prevent it.  The GOP only wants to get back to the good old days of following Democrats.  What ever Democrats want to do the country club GOP will agree with.  No one wants to pick up a rifle so America has been overthrown without firing a shot.  There isn&rsquo;t any place to go except a FEMA camp now.</p>

		<p>What this means is that we&rsquo;re gonna get more Affirmative Action &#8220;professionals&#8221; - which means, &#8220;NOT!!&#8221;  I would not allow any young minority &#8220;physician&#8221; near me for any reason - the example cited above, and the clear example of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s incompetent physician who killed him - how much more in terms of concrete examples do we need???  I go for Jewish, white, Asian, or E. India professionals, in that order.  And, what can I say; I&rsquo;m going on 65 and I&rsquo;m still here!</p>

		<p>Being one of 50 million hispanics is not being a minority. Being one of 18 million blacks is not being a minority. How about minority status for italians, only 9 million italian americans exist any more. </p>

<p>I have had a White Anglo doctor going on 35 years now (and before that also) and that is who I will keep no matter what&hellip;I have never been hospitalized for any reason except for childbirth..I am even older than you are. I do take alot of vitamins and different herbs. We have to be more involved in educating ourselves about remedies when the time comes because EVERY doctor in this country will be a foreigner, black or mexican.<br>

		<p>Our rulers will love adding medical care to hooks they have in us. In the end, we&rsquo;ll see &#8220;haters&#8221; and &#8220;racists&#8221; (meaning non-koolaid drinkers such as we) denied medical treatment, and even certified insane, locked up and &#8220;treated.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Soviet Union used to put dissidents in insane asylums. Chairman Mao denied cancer treatment to Chou En Lai. </p>
