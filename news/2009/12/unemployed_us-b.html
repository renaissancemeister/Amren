<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-11-29-citizen-day-laborers_N.htm">Unemployed U.S.-Born Workers Seek Day-Labor Jobs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Bazar, USA Today, November 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Growing ranks of U.S. citizens are heading to street corners and home improvement store parking lots to find day-labor work usually done by illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The trend is most pronounced in regions where hot construction markets have collapsed, says Abel Valenzuela Jr., a professor of urban planning at the University of California-Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had many, many unemployed construction workers who found themselves without any permanent or stable work,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Some of them have gone on to seek employment by standing on street corners alongside immigrant workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Valenzuela estimates the proportion of U.S.-born day laborers has at least doubled since he released a report in 2006, when his research showed they made up 7% of the day-labor workforce. At that time, Valenzuela estimated 117,600 people were looking for or doing day-labor jobs on any given day. Illegal immigrants were 75% of the day-labor workforce; the rest were legal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s becoming more ethnically diverse. On the corners, I&rsquo;ve seen white people, I&rsquo;ve seen African Americans and a lot of Mexican Americans,&#8221; says Pablo Alvarado, executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. &#8220;When unemployment benefits run out, I expect to see more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the communities seeing an increase in U.S.-citizen day laborers:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>oArlington, Va. Construction workers recently laid off are showing up at the day-labor hiring site run by the Shirlington Employment and Education Center, says executive director Andres Tobar: &#8220;We&rsquo;re seeing people who hadn&rsquo;t come to our center before who are legally here and U.S. citizens, and who are skilled workers and can&rsquo;t find work.&#8221;</p>
<p>oLos Angeles. Citizens are replacing immigrant day laborers who had trouble finding work and returned to their home countries, says Antonio Bernabe, senior organizer of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.</p>

		<p>This is one of the many blessings of diversity-extreme wage slavery for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS- brought to you by the 1965 IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT.</p>
<p>The left,liberals,free market conservatives,corporatists-worshippers of the corporation, the Republican and Democratic parties are thoroughly evil-creatures from Hell itself.</p>
<p>I do not support an immigration moratorium. I support nothing less than a complete shutdown of all post-1965 LEGAL IMMIGRATION. I also support deportations also.</p>
<p>There are only two choices: rebel against the complete race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS or sit in football stadiums-fat out of shape and emasculated-making young black males multimillionaires.</p>
<p>The Christian churches are also your enemy. Send your $$$$  donations to American Renassaince instead. </p>

		<p>Do those chumps really think a contracter is going to hire them over an illegal? If a contracter wanted to hire skilled whites he would have gone to the unions. </p>
<p>Out here in California, employers place want ads for laborers with the phrase &#8220;must be bilingual&#8221;. This is their code for &#8220;whites need not apply&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Numbersusa.com still refuses to acknowledge that NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS exist and that they are very rapidly being reduced to wage slaves.  Folks send your $$$$$ to American Renassaince and Vdare.com-and if you want to&hellip; Steve Sailer.</p>
<p>If you are a NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN&hellip;.The Republican party hates you and your family. The Republican party is the evil party. They know exactly what they are doing. They are taking orders from their corporate masters to get rid of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>The rebellion against complete race-replacement and the extreme wage slavery that comes with it requires the complete destruction of the Republican party. Peter Brimelow is wasting precious time trying to save this maldorous and rancid party of Karl Rove and Lindsay Graham. </p>
<p>It is now one minute to midnight for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. Non-whites such as Soledade O&rsquo;Brian are well of this. She can&rsquo;t get rid of US fast enough.</p>

<p>1) Whites tend to be more competent than browns.<br>
2) Union employees are far more expensive.</p>

<p>Whites also know their rights better than browns, and are more likely to sue for worker&rsquo;s comp if hurt on the job. This is why contractors will not hire white labor &#8220;off the books,&#8221; as they say. White day laborers only have a chance of getting work through some predatory labor hall that rakes off half their earnings, because the labor halls provide worker&rsquo;s comp insurance. <br>

		<p>Virtually ALL of the home building in Houston over the last 25 years was done using illegal immigrant labor. With the quality drop commensurate with the use of unskilled but cheap labor. Something homebuyers find out the hard way, since the house starts falling apart a few months after the builder&rsquo;s warranty has expired.</p>

<p>the Mexicans are looking for work, </p>
<p>the Whites are looking for a business card so that they can go back to the unemployment office and say &#8220;See, I looked for a job but they are not hiring&#8221;.</p>

<p>Still, another, is the guy with his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>And then there is the all too frequent fellow with zero skills.</p>
<p>And there is the other guy who is really looking for a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Most whites have the attitude: you are not paying me enough money for me to actually work and make you any money, I will only cover my wages, you dirty sob.</p>

<p>Might be true. But that&rsquo;s because the people doing the hiring in the A/C construction business know that they can pay invaders $5 per hour and let Uncle Sam cover the rest (and more!) of the mexican&rsquo;s needs. Meanwhile the decent white workers have moved on knowing they can&rsquo;t expect a living wage from the crooks who not only hire the mexicans for 1/3 to 1/8th what they&rsquo;d pay mexicans, but they still charge customers the same amount or more for the work done!  And the work is of inferior quality for the most part. The snide, anti-white remarks always come out, but they can&rsquo;t cover the truth. Look at the lawsuits faced by contractors like Kaufman- Broad in CA. The houses built by the &#8220;hard working&#8221; mexicans are falling apart, with shoddy workmanship become more and more common as more and hard working mestizos fill the jobs. It&rsquo;s a gold mine if you own a business I suppose. </p>

		<p>AMericans do look for work at day labor sites. I&rsquo;ve seen it increase and anyone who hasn&rsquo;t seen it (I live in Southern California)simply doesn&rsquo;t have an economy depressed enough. It is utter nonsense to believe that Americans won&rsquo;t work. A hundred times I&rsquo;ve stated that people who believe this need to travel more throughout the U.S. In every single region that hasn&rsquo;t yet been inundated with illegal aliens, Americans are doing every kind of job from janitor,to garbage collector,to fast food etc. Those who deny this are either ignorant of the facts or are inline, fully in sync, with the American destroying elite like Jorge, &#8220;jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do Bush&#8221;, and John, &#8220;Americans wouldn&rsquo;t pick lettuce for fifty dollars an hour&#8221;,McCain, and other &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;you fill in the word.</p>

		<p>Post #9 They&rsquo;re Crooks, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT in your description of the dynamics of illegal alien labor. It is exactly what I have observed in California for at least thirty years now. ILLEGAL ALIEN LABOR IS HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED LABOR,and until Americans of all stripes get this through their heads, they can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine the damage it does.</p>

<p><br>
<b><i> Uh no. Not actually.  Here are the facts:</i></b></p>
<p>Commercial AC pays about $15 / hr, plus 7.5% for SS, and about $5.5 for workmens compensation for a semi skilled laborer.  This adds up to about $21.63 per hour on the low side.  Naturally better workers get better pay.</p>
<p>Residential, new construction, tract house AC construction in Houston pays between $1.00 and $10 per day on the low side for duct work installation.  These are jobs done by the illegal mexican and south Americans.  An Indian firm specializes in this practice.  Their man in the field is affectionately referred to as The Slave Master.  He can split a penny into 100 parts. Not surprisingly, it is not uncommon for his slaves to urinate in the return air closet as their special way of saying thank you to the man. Five dollars an hour is an unheard of kings ransom in this market.</p>
<p>It is true that the whites doing quality work have been shut out of the residential tract home (FHA, VA, GNMA financed) construction market due to the fact that they cannot live on $1 to $10 per twelve hour day for their labor.  </p>

		<p>It is true Kulaks never learn. In more ways than one. In CA the illegals are paid $4 - $7 hr to do commercial AC. It is generally cash. The mexicans are here because they can get paid under the table and enjoy all the handouts from Uncle Sam. Which of course comes from &#8220;tax&#8221; money confiscated from (mostly) White Americans. There are hardly any Whites doing ANY work in construction at all in CA. That&rsquo;s why things have fallen apart here. It&rsquo;s probably little different in Texas when it comes to construction. </p>
