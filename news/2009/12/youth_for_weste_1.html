<h1>Youth for Western Civilization Defeated</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meghan Conway, The Cowl (Providence College, Rhode Island), December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Over 100 students attended the Student Congress meeting on Tuesday, during which the voting members of Congress voted down legislation that would have made Youth for Western Civilization a proposed club, 16 to 12. Congress hotly debated the proposed club at last week&rsquo;s meeting. A specific issue was first raised at the Dec. 1 meeting was the appearance of Providence College as a chapter of the national organization on the YWC Web site before Congress had officially sanctioned it. Other members of Congress opposed the group.</p>
<p>{snip} [Tim] Dionisopoulos said that he would like to bring speakers to campus to speak to students such as political figures. The discussion then turned to issues of Youth for Western Civilization&rsquo;s affiliation with the National Chapter of YWC.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think PC students&rsquo; memberships to the national organization should be independent of Providence College,&#8221; said Skye Hawkins &rsquo;12. &#8220;If Tim [Dionisopoulos] were willing to disassociate his group from the national organization of Youth for Western Civilization, I would urge Congress to put forth a new piece of legislation which would state this distinction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dionisopoulos opposed the suggestion. &#8220;First off, I really can&rsquo;t accomplish any goals with my organization without affiliation with the National Youth for Western Civilization because we wouldn&rsquo;t get any speakers, funding, or connections,&#8221; said Dionisopoulos. &#8220;They have never done anything wrong and have been well behaved on every single campus. We cannot be an effective organization if we don&rsquo;t have national affiliation.&#8221; Dionisopoulos then spoke of the club&rsquo;s longevity. &#8220;We have six members here tonight and a lot of freshman support,&#8221; said Dionisopoulos. &#8220;We have a lot of members on our Facebook page  &mdash;  and we&rsquo;re hoping to grow once we can finally work with SAIL.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some students felt uncomfortable with YWC&rsquo;s mission statement. On the national Web site under the &#8220;Our Mission&#8221; page it says, &#8220;We have the self-evident right and duty to work for the survival of our own culture and civilization.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is no reason to believe that the advances of modernity and the political freedoms we enjoy will endure with the extinction of the civilization that allowed them to exist. Western Civilization is our civilization and in spite of the continual assault and hatred it endures from the radical left, we wish to revive the West, rather than see our civilization be sent to the graveyard of history.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Providence College graduate student Jonathan Paquette discussed how the group would treat Islam. &#8220;We are actually quite interested in discussing the relationship between the Muslim world and what we understand to be the western world,&#8221; said Paquette. &#8220;We are not in any way ethnically or culturally monolithic, and everyone is welcome to join. We are more of an intellectual group than anything else. We are mostly rightist, but are not exclusionary and would not ban a Muslim member if they joined.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not all students felt that the group was in violation of the College&rsquo;s mission. Katrina Lapinsky &rsquo;12 took a different standpoint on the organization. &#8220;I think this club has a possibility to bring some educational enrichment to this campus,&#8221; said Lapinksy. &#8220;I see students here who aren&rsquo;t normally active on this campus and are finally participating.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If Tim [Dionisopoulos] and his group are being truthful about what they want to accomplish, I think that it can bring something to PC that we don&rsquo;t have. However, I think minorities on this campus are worried for their safety because of the stigma of this organization and I think safety needs to be highlighted. I think the way the group is being proposed right now doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make the student body feel safe and there are a number of ways this can be fixed, like possibly removing itself from national organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Angela Marathakis, academic skills specialist at Providence College, expressed her concern with the club in terms of students feeling safe. &#8220;I was asked to come here by some of my own student athletes who feel threatened by this club on campus,&#8221; said Marathakis. &#8220;So, I want you to know that there are a lot of people who feel uncomfortable with this on campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marathakis was not the only person to express a fear for safety on campus. &#8220;As a woman of color and a daughter of immigrants, I feel highly uncomfortable with this group and on this campus,&#8221; said Naomi Brown-Jones &rsquo;11. &#8220;To already have to struggle so much as a person who looks like me in a classroom daily, I don&rsquo;t appreciate having to struggle against a group in my extracurricular activities that has stigmas like this. On this campus I want people to welcome me and foster my growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The members of Youth for Western Civilization did not respond to the comment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paquette made a closing statement before the vote. &#8220;By shutting us down, by confining us to the shadows, aren&rsquo;t you really just telling us to &#8216;shut up and go away?&rsquo;&#8221; said Paquette. &#8220;I think you should be a little bit more grown up than that.&#8221; Following Paquette&rsquo;s remarks a motion to vote was approved, and the proposed legislation was voted down to a round of applause.<br>

						<p>
							<i>Timothy Dionisopoulos, Youth for Western Civilization, December 14, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>If I were the conventional college student, during my undergraduate years I probably would be keeping my mouth shut, paying open-jawed homage to everything my professors say, and joining a few benign clubs to boost my résumé. I was already an &#8220;individual of interest&#8221; on campus, but I was officially deemed persona non grata once I took the plunge and attempted to start up a chapter of Youth for Western Civilization.</p>
<p>Providence College, an ostensibly Catholic institution, seemed to me like a perfect fit for a chapter of Youth for Western Civilization since the school already requires a 20-credit, two semester course on Western Civilization and has received top ratings from the conservative Cardinal Newman Society. I was wrong.</p>
<p>The first sign of trouble was when our group&rsquo;s request to bring former Congressman Tom Tancredo to campus for a speech on the topic of illegal immigration was rejected by the college without any legitimate reason. Congressman Tancredo defiantly decided to come anyways and gave a speech at the gates of Providence College which resulted in great deal of media coverage.</p>
<p>As the start of the 2009-2010 school year drew near, I contacted the members of Student Congress and attempted to have our chapter officially recognized. By becoming an officially recognized club, we would have the ability to book rooms, host events on campus and generally convey our point of view to other students in a respectable fashion. Despite numerous delays, including changes to the club recognition process while we were in media res, the members of our chapter patiently waited for nine months in order to get a hearing. After various administrators determined that our mission statement did not conflict with that of the college, the process dictated we would be put before two full sessions of Student Congress.</p>
<p>These two meetings with Student Congress could justifiably be likened to the Salem witch trials, as every possible rumor was deemed truth, every lie as true as gold, and every accusation beyond the pale of doubt. The few sane voices in the room were drowned out by the mass of ill-informed leftists who were on a divine mission from the gods of multiculturalism to prevent our club from receiving a fair hearing.</p>
<p>This farce included administrators arriving to claim that our mere presence on campus would be intimidating to the student athlete population on campus and would dissuade further recruits from wanting to attend Providence College. Additionally, a self-described woman of color protested that &#8220;to already have to struggle so much as a person who looks like me in a classroom daily, I don&rsquo;t appreciate having to struggle against a group in my extracurricular activities that has stigmas like this.&#8221; These and other absurd indictments continued until, eventually, the feel-good culture of the accusatory echo chamber reigned and Student Government voted us down, pausing only to applaud their own courage.</p>
<p>What is most significant about this whole ordeal is that Student Congress was even given the power to vote us down. In order to become an officially recognized group on campus, we needed two-thirds approval of the notoriously left-leaning Student Congress members. In other words, Providence Student Congress is vested with the power of de facto censorship of any political opinions they disagree with. This power can be considered nothing other than John Stuart Mill&rsquo;s &#8220;tyranny of the majority&#8221; and is an affront to the entire American political tradition.</p>
<p>If an unscrupulous band of college-aged bureaucrats has the authority on a college campus to determine which political opinions can and cannot be heard and which groups of students are and are not allowed to organize in defense of their culture, what can be said about that campus&rsquo;s devotion to intellectual and moral integrity? If these practices of censorship and suppression are present in the very place where, if anywhere, students are supposed to hear both sides of issues and decide where they stand for themselves, what are we to think about the devotion to truth that is said to be fundamental to our education?<br>

<p>Now there&rsquo;s a laugh   &mdash;   the &#8220;student athletes,&#8221; most of whom are probably black, feel threatened by three white students espousing conservative rhetoric.  I bet almost all the crimes on that campus are done at the hands of the the very &#8220;student athletes&#8221; (rimshot) that &#8220;asked her to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from that, I am not a big fan of conservative or right-wing campus auxiliary organizations.  You can see one of the reasons in this article   &mdash;   constant harassment by campus authorities, and violence that professors provoke other students (&#8220;anarchists&#8221;) to commit against the members of such orgs.  The other reason is that I always thought that the concept is condescending and insulting to young adults   &mdash;    I didn&rsquo;t learn the things I learned about politics, racial and otherwise, by hanging around other 20-year olds when I was 20 years old (an ever increasing long time ago)   &mdash;   I learned them by hanging around middle aged (and older), experienced men and women.  You socialize young people by putting them around older people, not other young people.</p>

<p>Eh, what?  Is she admitting that she is woefully unqualified to be at this college?  No, she is unarticulately moaning about having to &#8220;rise above&#8221; all of the invisible racism that she must slog through on a daily basis. Just another minority that feels the need to be celebrated and ego stroked for just showing up.    </p>

		<p>Well, good. Cause the only way to even begin to bring diversity to campus, for real, is to enshrine and lionize multiple student groups on campus, not like YWC, but exactly like White United Students. There they can rightly join their many non-white counterparts on campus. A university obsessed with &#8216;diversity&rsquo; would be sure to do this adhering to their other cherished principles such as affirmative action, to remedy this terrible and long standing injustice. </p>

<p>That is utterly laughable!</p>
<p>If anything it is whites on any college campus who should feel threatened by that cream of the ghetto&rsquo;s crop, &ldquo;student athletes.&rdquo; With their bellicose ignorance and spaced-out depravity, it is mostly black &ldquo;student athletes&rdquo; who make college campuses brutal zoos, where explosive violence and sexual predation are becoming exponentially &ldquo;ordinary.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I finished graduate school about 12 years ago and there were constant incidents of diversity induced mayhem even then, so I can only imagine what it is like now in any university in this country because of the growing numbers of &ldquo;student athletes&rdquo; and others of color. As this article demonstrates yet again, they are always the first to claim irrational fears over just about anything, be it the food in the cafeteria, or an organization dedicated to preserving civilization.  </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p> So some students wouldn&rsquo;t &#8220;feel safe&#8221; with YWC on campus? What a hoot! Are they afraid they&rsquo;d actually LEARN SOMETHING that isn&rsquo;t approved by the sachems of academic political correctness?</p>
<p> And it&rsquo;s equally amusing to hear the left professing &#8220;fear&#8221; of a conservative organization with no record of any physical violence, when it&rsquo;s just such organizations which have been shouted down and threatened by leftist bullies when they&rsquo;ve tried to speak or hold programs on so many campuses.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the struggle? Does this woman have to Struggle to turn on a light switch, use the toilet, drive a car, turn on her air conditioner, watch tv, etc., all things she&rsquo;s gottten from western civilization? Would she prefer to be back in her parents homeland where these horrible conveniences of western civilization that make her so &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; were hardly known? I think not. So many of these poor young minorities are so absolutely ignorant it&rsquo;s astounding. If they only could hear themselves, they&rsquo;d be so ashamed, they&rsquo;d want to crawl under a rock.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Dionisopoulis, I think he was very much aware of the way it&rsquo;d all turn out. But I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with keeping the heat turned up on these people. I would say he did a good job.</p>
<p>In the end, we&rsquo;ll take care of all this ridiculous nonsense and it&rsquo;ll all seem like a bad dream. Actually, nobody will believe such things as political correctness and multiculturism ever existed. Mainly because they defy common sense at every level.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a hint folks:  The people in power are going to use their power to try to shut down any threat (real or imagined) to it.</p>
<p>YWC is playing the game of the enemy probably because they feel they have to.  At best they could try a lawsuit and I wish them the best of luck if they do try it.</p>
<p>However, words alone are going to do nothing in the long run.  Especially when major media outlets and text books are mostly biased against White Western civilization.</p>
<p>I believe us few, who see the destruction of the West for what it is, will have to make an aggressive stand against those who are destroying us.  We must control the flow of information like the Left does right now, if we are to be understood by the majority of society.</p>
<p>YWC has it&rsquo;s heart in the right place but as long as they play  nice with people who seek the death of the West they will go nowhere.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Tim SHOULD have answered that no other self-interest groups on campus are required to disassociate themselves from their national or outside organizations, and why not?  He SHOULD have pointed out that this would be a case of glaring discrimination against just his own group.  And WHY?   He should have demanded to know just HOW somebody there would be  made to feel &#8220;unsafe&#8221;.    Put them on the line, make them explain!  So often our &#8220;leaders&#8221; are too polite and passive;  they fail to lash back and  fight fire with fire. We need to grow more spine, more outrage, more passion; we&rsquo;re not going to win anything by being &#8220;nice&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This is a minature version of what will\ is happening in the whole country now. As the non-White and liberal numbers increase, they&rsquo;ll simply &#8220;vote&#8221; us out. The White politicians that have spent their entire careers selling out, [ Hillary Clinton ] will be\are so SURPRISED when the very people they groveled to, throw them under the bus in favor of a &#8220;President Opama&#8221;, &#8220;Sen. Jamal&#8221; or &#8220;Congressman Martinez&#8221;.<br>
About this YWC group at this college, I think they have every right to sue this college into bankruptcy. Hit them where it hurts. It&rsquo;s worked pretty well for our enemies. You don&rsquo;t win a war by being polite. Lots of Whites need to wake up, blow out their candles, and start saying it like it is and take back their countries before it&rsquo;s too late. Once the enemy gets it, they will NEVER give it back. Never in history has non-White rule over Whites ended well for Whites. <br>

<p>Gangs of mean, nasty and semi-dangerous lesbians, homosexuals, blacks, hispanics, yellows, commies and other assorted freaks are looking to rule by terror and spoiling for a fight provided they outnumber you in that fight by 5 to 1.

		<p>It&rsquo;s hardly surprising that the radical left wins again on a U.S. college campus.  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d have no trouble at all endorsing a local chapter of MEChA (if they don&rsquo;t already have one).</p>

		<p>&#8220;it&rsquo;s equally amusing to hear the left professing &ldquo;fear&rdquo; of a conservative organization with no record of any physical violence, when it&rsquo;s just such organizations which have been shouted down and threatened by leftist bullies when they&rsquo;ve tried to speak or hold programs on so many campuses&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually seen this excuse used to keep conservative speakers off campus. Leftist activists disrupt an event and cause violence. In response, a sympathetic campus turns away future conservative speakers, because of &#8220;fear of violence&#8221;. The false implication being it&rsquo;s the controversial speaker who is the cause of violence. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always about the non-whites, isn&rsquo;t it? Affirmative action and quota systems to get them through college and careers, &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws that protect them and punish whites, free hand-outs, preferential treatment from our corrupt government, &#8220;diversity training&#8221; that glorifies them and vilifies whites.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I finished graduate school about 12 years ago and there were constant incidents of diversity induced mayhem even then, so I can only imagine what it is like now in any university in this country because of the growing numbers of &ldquo;student athletes&rdquo; and others of color&#8221; John PM</p>
<p>    The diversity induced mayhem has gotten much worse John. Mostly, because the sixties radicals are now in charge of most social sciences and humanities departments. Many of the older, more objective, faculty are gone.  More emphasis is placed on &#8220;critical studies&#8221; (social engineering and advanced brainwashing) than inconvenient facts. </p>

		<p>Communism ruled the campuses of the USSR and look where it got them, so I wouldn&rsquo;t get too worried about this kind of incident.

		<p>Even the White Celts are defeating themselves in Atlanta today. </p>
<p>On public TV is a show about the Celtic Collection, and after the White Celtic commentator praised his organization for how &#8220;multicultural&#8221; it is, they then started interviewing their afrcocultural fashion model. It has come to this: even the proud Celts are under the voodoo spell of multiculturalism. Sometimes I hate being white when I see what we&rsquo;ve done to ourselves. And the afro model being interviewed is slow, dull, and not pretty, but is at least authentically afro in facial features, but she unfortunately straightens her hair to be less intimidating to whites. That&rsquo;s a shame. We want them natural, which means intimidating.</p>
<p>Take a look at these afronatural names from today&rsquo;s arrest news of the 30 Deep Gang here in &#8220;the ATL&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;The four adults were identified as Javorris Redding, Jonquavious Hood, Tavorris Seays and Tomarkus Thomas. They were charged with burglary, theft by receiving and criminal damage to property.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank God for afro-ebonics! We all know that the mug shots would match the names. No whitey-wannabes in that bunch, thankfully. None of the white acting, book reading, affirmative action scamming college admissions, no white money scholarships for them! Tush, tush.</p>

		<p>Stop asking Liberal Morons for your Rights, and do it, anyway. Have your Club on Campus, regardless if it is approved or not.</p>
<p>You pay your tuition, unlike these poor Ghetto types, that pay nothing to go to College. So, use the power of your dollars to demand your Rights on campus.</p>
<p>Secondly, if they try and stop you from holding Rallies, or other functions, such as meetings, and Dances, then use your right to sue them for harrasment, and for violating your First Amendment Rights. </p>
<p>I am sure your Law Suit would wake a few Administrators up, to leave you the hell alone. Law Suits have that affect on people.</p>
<p>You also have to remember that College Students, as well as High School Students, are attracted to things that have been banned by Authorities. Drinking and pot come right to mind. </p>
<p>Use your banned status to attract even more White Students, who may not be Racially Conscious, about the current situation of their own people, and Country. You will probably find that those unaware White Students become your most staunch supporters. </p>

		<p>Question Diversity~</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t learn the things I learned about politics, racial and otherwise, by hanging around other 20-year olds when I was 20 years old (an ever increasing long time ago)  &mdash;  I learned them by hanging around middle aged (and older), experienced men and women. You socialize young people by putting them around older people, not other young people.</p>
<p>This is one of the main weapons used against our society.  Public schools isolate the youth from maturing elements by segregating them by age.  They wallow in their immaturity until they cannot relate to mature adults.  In the one room school house young children tried to be mature like the older children in the class.  This is why we had 15 year olds trying to join the navy 50 years ago.  Today, they only try to impress each other by seeing how weird and useless they can be.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard this type of wisdom since the Earl of St. Louis was around.<br>

<p>She makes an interesting point. Dinesh De Souza makes this point in his book &#8216;illiberal education&rsquo; - special interest groups on campus become a platform for making attacks on everyone else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all hypothetical of course. What&rsquo;s odd about this group applauding, while voting down YWC, for what they might do, is that universities do sanction and approve &#8216;minority&rsquo; groups, specifically devoted to race, on nearly every campus in the nation (and at this point, at many campuses and in many states now, it makes no sense to call them &#8216;minority&rsquo; groups - what unites them is there are not clubs for whites and of course their activism), and these groups have been proactive for decades.</p>
<p>So again, the thinking and caring people make a public show of concerned for what might happen while turning a blind eye to what is happening for real. Again, the only way to counter this, or at least make things equal, is to bring in groups like YWC, maybe not exactly like YWC, they do seem offense, but then, only whites are ever seen as offensive.</p>
<p>The reverse logic on display here is not a big surprise. I&rsquo;ve found many of these same folks use the term &#8216;red-neck&rsquo;, a racial slur, in an effort, to prove to everyone else how enlightened they are.    </p>
