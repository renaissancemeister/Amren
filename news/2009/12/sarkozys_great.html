			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), December 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It seemed like a good idea at the time  &mdash;  a website where the French could take part in a debate about their national identity.</p>
<p>But Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s hopes for a civilised exchange of views have been dashed.</p>
<p>Thousands of racist contributions have been posted with the general theme that foreigners should go home.</p>
<p>&#8216;France has become an African colony in a way which cannot be reversed,&rsquo; reads one, while another says: &#8216;Before France had colonies, now it&rsquo;s been colonised itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Others read: &#8216;Nobody in France asked to be invaded by strangers&rsquo;, &#8216;Being French is to be born in France to two French parents&rsquo;, and &#8216;Immigrants who want to impose their lifestyles on us should go home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Francois Fillon today defended the debate, giving an impassioned speech on the subject of &#8216;what it means to be French&rsquo; at a Paris think-tank.</p>
<p>He was standing in for President Nicolas Sarkozy who bailed out citing scheduling difficulties as the debate was turning sour.</p>
<p>&#8216;To refuse this debate and stigmatise the idea that the French people have a unique identity amounts to leaving the field open to extremists,&rsquo; Mr Fillon said.</p>
<p>He was echoing Sarkozy&rsquo;s view that traditional parties like the ruling UMP need to reclaim the subject of patriotic pride from the anti-immigrant National Front, which has long presented itself as the champion of a &#8216;true France&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A spokesman for immigration minister Eric Besson said the overtly racist comments were &#8216;inexcusable&rsquo;, but other negative views were all part of the democratic debate.</p>
<p>The spokesman added: &#8216;Two weeks ago we were criticised for censoring people, and today we&rsquo;re criticised for respecting a large diversity of opinions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Yazid Sabeg, the commissioner for diversity and equality, said he &#8216;deplored&rsquo; the terms of the debate opened by Mr Besson&rsquo;s site, adding: &#8216;national identity is a dangerous debate. One has to give the debate the dignity and depth it deserves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All French citizens were invited to take part in Mr Sarkozy&rsquo;s Great Debate on national identity, which is set to last until the end of January next year.</p>
<p>Racial tension has been rife in recent years, with riots in high immigration suburbs, fears about Islamic terrorism, attempts to ban Muslim veils, and fears that the Gallic identify is disappearing in the global economy.</p>
<p>France has one of the highest proportions of immigrants in Europe, as well as the largest Muslim population of around five million.</p>
<p>Mr Sarkozy said it was important for everyone to discuss their identity because what it meant to be French was &#8216;forgotten and sometimes denied&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Opposition Socialists have argued that the national identity debate is a political stunt aimed at winning the support of the far-right National Front ahead of regional elections in March.</p>
<p>Intellectuals and philosophers have also been among those saying the debate encourages xenophobia and racism.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Debating race and immigration just encourages &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;xenophobia.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary to debate race and immigration, if those two problems had not been imported into their country.</p>
<p>They were fools to allow their country to be inundated with rabble, so now they&rsquo;re going to have to pay the price.  There will be much inter-tribal fighting.  But it&rsquo;s exactly what they deserve.</p>

		<p>And why is it that Sarkozy or anyone else think the &#8220;national identity&#8221; was ever inseparable from race?  &#8220;National&#8221; or &#8220;nation&#8221; has its root in the Latin nascere, to be born.  When you&rsquo;re born, you have parents, grandparents, and other familial relatives, who are, for most people, of the same race as yourself.</p>
<p>The only way &#8220;national identity&#8221; might have do nothing to race if it is a creed.  But the problem with that, as Sam Francis said, is that a creed is also exclusionary   &mdash;   if you disagree with the creed, then you&rsquo;re not a good French(wo)man.  The USSR was based on a creed, and partly thanks to a certain 16th President, the USA is, too, and those who disagree with the creed are persecuted or marginalized.</p>

		<p>as someone of part-french heritage myself from southern louisiana i can say that racial and cultural preservation of louisiana&rsquo;s cajun french people is very strong. conservative ideology is as strong as ever among any homogenous white ethnic group. most of our french were for well over 200 years self-sufficient and cultivated the land, lived off the wildlife in the swamps and bayous of southern la. and were fiercely proud of their heritage.<br>
i have no problem extrapolating their attitudes here to those of their ancestors in native france. muslim and african culture do not mix well with the french. and for 2 openly hostile ethnic groups to move in and hijack their language and culture would not sit well here, i can safely say.<br>
sarkozy strikes me as a conservative and represented the &#8221;last gasp&#8221; so to speak of the white french people as europe herself is swept up in a torrent of islamic and african invasion. as in the rest of europe this spells suicide for those of us racially aware enough to recognize it.</p>

<p>Day by day across the Western world the veneer of political correctness wears thinner.  The media and government can&rsquo;t keep a lid on the backlash rising from a people betrayed.</p>

<p>How is speaking the truth racist?</p>
<p>What debate do they want? Pleasantries about how wonderful the racial transformation has been tinged with self-flagellation that &#8216;we&rsquo;re not doing enough to make our replacement population feel welcome&rsquo;?</p>
<p>We have the same thing going on in the comment section of the on-line Buffalo News. Anyone can flag any comment as &#8216;inappropriate&rsquo; and they are removed. (The &#8216;inappropriate&rsquo; button used to be, until just a few weeks ago, the &#8216;abuse&rsquo; button). The Buffalo News also deletes comments without warning. Another thing they do is to delete all comments and start fresh when the discussion gets heated.</p>
<p>The last thing these people want is a debate. What they want is submission and surrender, joy and praise for our own displacement if not genocide.</p>
<p>These people are desperate to hide the truth that people don&rsquo;t like what&rsquo;s going on. Our elites have set our course and no &#8216;debate&rsquo; is allowed.</p>

		<p> Let&rsquo;s hope Sarkozy sticks to his guns and keeps the website up. I don&rsquo;t think there is any &#8220;right not to be offended&#8221; in the French Constitution (or any other, for that matter, despite what the multi-culti bleeding hearts would like you to believe), and if some of these immigrants and their sympathizers get their feelings hurt by postings on the website, tough luck. They brought a lot of it on themselves.</p>

		<p>A debate causes &#8220;racism&#8221;?  So say &#8220;intellectuals&#8221;?  Who are the extremists?  Who are the fascists? France for the French. How unreasonable. How &#8220;racist&#8221;? I remember when the French settlers who created modern Algeria tried to retain a leading role there. Out they went as their own govt betrayed them and Communist led terrorists blasted French civilization to bits in the early sixties.</p>
<p> Disaster for Algeria. And now disaster for France.</p>

Promiscuity with quality culture and genetics, ..contrary to political correctness, is not a form of genorosity. It is sato-masochism.

		<p>If I remember correctly, didn&rsquo;t Sarkozy invite the new multiculturalism of France. Did he not celebrate it? The National Front party is right. This is nothing but a political ploy to gain support away from the National Front!  They say..Thousands of &#8220;racist&#8221; posts have been published&#8221;. Really? A people that want to keep their own nation for their own people is racist in their warped minds? Gee and all Sarkozy wanted is a &#8220;civilized&#8221; debate. Tell us Sarkozy, what is civilized in your view? For the French people to just shut up and die and hand France over to the aliens? GO NATIONAL FRONT!</p>

<b>&lsquo;France has become an African colony in a way which cannot be reversed,&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The first part is certainly true.  Yes,  France has turned into an African colony. But I disagree that it &#8220;cannot be reversed&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they say in French, but in English we have a saying:  &#8220;Where there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way.&#8221;</p>

		<p>       Oh the glory of France. What airs they adopt and poses they strike. If they cared so much about what the People thought, why didn&rsquo;t they debate the issue of identity before they CHANGED the identity of the French People-forever? Like all Sadists, the ultimate victory is for the victim to capitulate and accept their own treatment. Nay more: enjoy it. May the French People deny the Globalists this final triumph. At least sour their victory with cries of Traitor, Villain, and Criminal.</p>

		<p>A few months ago Sarkozy implemented &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221; in the hiring of nonwhites vs Whites.  He also demanded the French miscegenate with the invaders or France would be sorry.  This guy is an immigrant himself from Eastern Europe of questionable (not really) non-European ancestry and I&rsquo;m not talking about gypsie either.   <br>

		<p>The sad side to this story is the oft repeated resentment I heard and hear from French people in France and even here on the West Coast of the U.S. (when I meet them).  They HATE all the British who have bought up homes in villages all over France, fleeing the cultural mess of the UK.  It&rsquo;s easy for them because of the centuries of conflict with England, Trafalgar, Wellington, etc.  IMO it is a huge mistake as many of those Brits are of Norman ancestry - for one thing.  The other is that it is misplaced resentment.  At least this article reflects some properly directed concern.</p>

<p>Yes, somehow French culture has generally grown to embrace the Left-Banke, Marc Bloch political socialist movement and converted the title &#8220;Intellectual&#8221; to infer membership therein.  That is an interesting bit of revealing history - the Marc Bloch story.  Anyone who takes the time to understand this huge misinterpretation of this French Historian&rsquo;s life (and death)will learn a great deal about the left in the West.  Historian Norman Cantor wrote a very good chapter on him in his book,  &#8220;Inventing the Middle Ages.&#8221;<br>

		<p>When challenging multi-cultis, I think it&rsquo;s best not to call them Reds and traitors, but to simply ask them questions.  The point is not to get an honest answer, but to force them to give a flagrantly dishonest answer, and so discredit them in the eyes of others.  Worked for Perry Mason, and Socrates, every time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no wonder to it at all. The truth behind non-white immigration to the US, to the motives behind the people who wrote the Immigration Act of 1965 (it wasn&rsquo;t Teddy K)  are all pushed aside by the MSM as &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221; because of the evil, the hatred in the people who did this. They simply hate European whites. This has to be made to clear to everyone. How anyone who steps back and looks at the truth could not see this or would try to deny it is beyond any rational, honest person. </p>

<p>I can see it so clearly yet the ignorance among the general public is astonishing.  I was at my job Friday when one of my co-workers was listening to Neil Boortz on the radio.  I personally can&rsquo;t stand listening to this rude loud mouth and his neocon nausea or his inarticulate black sidekick.  Anyhow, a caller in the Atlanta area phoned in to complain that his new union bosses didn&rsquo;t want their workers having their annual Christmas party and they said if they complained about it they&rsquo;d fire them.  He explained that they had held it every Christmas for years but that the new bosses were of &#8220;non-Christian beliefs&#8221;.  Boortz sounded uncomfortable with the call and did everything he could to dance around the issue.  Anyone who would call this guy to complain about something like this is totally ignorant of what&rsquo;s going on in the world and the interaction probably went over the head of my clueless co-worker as well.    </p>
