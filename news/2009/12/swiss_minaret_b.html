<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world/20091129/INTERNATIONAL-US-SWISS-MINARETS/">Swiss Minaret Ban Reversal Vote in Pipeline</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, December 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Swiss liberals are considering a new referendum to overturn the ban on building new minarets in the country, Sunday papers reported, as Libya&rsquo;s Muamar Gaddafi warned the ban played into the hands of terrorists.</p>
<p>Club Helvetique, a group of over 20 Swiss intellectuals, will draw up an action plan to overturn the ban, which has drawn widespread criticism abroad and prompted hundreds of people to take to the streets this weekend in Zurich, Basel and Berne.</p>
<p>&#8220;A new initiative is the most democratic way of achieving this,&#8221; constitutional lawyer Joerg Mueller told Sonntag.</p>
<p>Voters adopted the ban in a referendum a week ago, defying the government and parliament which had warned the right-wing initiative violated the Swiss constitution, freedom of religion and a cherished tradition of tolerance.</p>
<p>Two complaints questioning the legality of ban had already been handed to Switzerland&rsquo;s Federal Court, Sonntag said.</p>
<p>Libya leader Gaddafi said the ban had done a great favor to al Qaeda militants, who would use it to attract recruits in a holy war against Europe, news agency SDA reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;The activists are now saying: &#8216;we told you that they are our enemies .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. join al Qaeda and declare jihad on Europe &#8216;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Politicians from the SVP, Switzerland&rsquo;s biggest party, and the conservative Federal Democratic Union gathered enough signatures to force the referendum on the initiative which opposed the &#8220;Islamisation of Switzerland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its campaign poster showed the Swiss flag covered in missile-like minarets and the portrait of a woman covered with a black chador and veil associated with strict Islam.</p>

<p>I believe several years back Colonel Gaddafi smugly predicted that Europe was destined to become Muslim.  But the  proclamations of Gaddafi and his ilk will likely have the opposite effect, and more and more people in Europe will begin to realize the magnitude of the threat.</p>
<p>Essentially what the jihadists are saying is this:  Native-born sons of Europe, turn your continent over to us and go the way of the North American Indian or we will launch a terror campaign against you.       </p>

		<p>Any time a free country votes against ANYTHING Muslim, they are going to be threatened with &#8220;al-Quaeda attacks.&#8221;  We cannot give in to that.  We have got to stand our ground and de-Islamize our own country, and hope that the Swiss do the same.</p>

<p>In a sane world, these 20 Swiss &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; and their hundredes of people on the street [a large % probably being Muslim] would be rounded up [ immediately-no trials,prison etc.] and FORCED out of the country, NEVER allowed back. That is the only thing that will stop this insanity. We are witnessing the downfall of our beloved Europe in our lifetime by OUR OWN people! The Muslims aren&rsquo;t doing it, OUR people are! And make no mistake, this is heading our way soon.<br>

		<p>Canada is officially a bilingual English-French country. The two languages are supposed to be treated equally but everyone appreciates that French needs special consideration to survive. English would overwhelm it unless specially protected. In Quebec English is discriminated against in many circumstances. Signs in stores require French writing to be larger. Newcomers to Quebec must educate their children in French schools. The Swiss might look to this Canadian example for a precedent to treat Islam separately from any equality of religion principles. </p>

<p>Make a deal with the Colonel. Tell him that mosques having minarets in Switzerland will be allowed when:</p>
<p>1. Churches can be built in Libya.</p>
<p>2. Bibles can be passed out to Libyans and the good news of JESUS can be openly expressed.</p>
<p>That is all. Nothing more than that! See if he goes for it. </p>

		<p>Gaddafi is bluffing us.   It is passivity among whites which stimulates aggression from North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>This modest display of national pride in the heart of Europe will startle the jihadists and weaken their resolve.  A full-on European committment to national preservation would stop them entirely.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>In other words, they are considering a new referendum to over-turn the previous referendum!  It&rsquo;s kind of like the Lisbon Treaty all over again, isn&rsquo;t it?  They&rsquo;ll keep at it until they get what they want, and won&rsquo;t take &#8220;no&#8221; for an answer.</p>
<p>And incidentally, how many charches does Gaddafi allow to be built in Libya?</p>
<p>Lastly, let me say that NONE OF THIS NONSENSE would be happening if there were no Moslem immigrants in Switzerland in the first place.  The first and gravest mistake was to let them in. The second worst mistake is to allow them to stay. They can&rsquo;t be subverting and terrorizing you if they&rsquo;re not there.  </p>
<p>What gives them the notion that they have any &#8220;right&#8221;  to be in Switzerland at all?  It&rsquo;s like the guest who came to visit, and ends up demanding your home.</p>
<p>Moral: Beware of  &#8220;guest workers&#8221;, refugees, and immigrants! It&rsquo;s easy to get them to come, but hell to get them to go.</p>

<p>This is the Sword of Damocles that hangs over EU, anything the muslims want, they will get or threaten violence (which they do anyway) and the EU capitulates. It wasn&rsquo;t Ghadafi that said EU would be muslim, it was a Pakistani muslim member of England&rsquo;s Parliament that said it.</p>

I say, if a terrorist attack were to happen soon in Switzerland, after what Kadhaffi said, that would be a sufficient reason to bomb Lybia!</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the logic. The Swiss don&rsquo;t want Minarets and because of this fact Libya says that it would be OK to declare holy war against Switzerland.</p>
<p>Based on this logic it should be OK to declare war on nations that prohibits the building of churches.</p>

		<p>It reminds me of gay activists in the U.S.  They lose same-sex marriage votes in a state legislature, so they instantly file papers taking the matter to court.  If they lose in court, they want to refile for legislative approval  &mdash;  all the while protesting in the streets.  They and their far-left friends lie about it in the media, claiming states with mere civil-union laws have legalized gay marriage and talking as though liberal courts represent the will of the people.  </p>

<p>By this majority vote, Switzerland has PROVEN that it has a vigorous and healthy democracy.  Islam, on the other hand, has no understanding or love for democracy at all.  How ironic for an Islamic imam to be appealing to democracy! &hellip; the very thing that Islam would abolish.</p>

<p>Swiss constitutional guarantees are meant for Swiss citizens.  Yes, Switzerland DOES have a precious tradition of religious freedom and tolerance. That guarantee was intended FOR SWISS CITIZENS   &mdash;    not for everybody else who chooses to come there and impose their ways of life upon the Swiss, whether the Swiss like it or not!</p>

Relations between Libya and Switzerland have been tense since the son and daughter-in-law of Gaddafi were arrested in Geneva  last year on charges of  abusing the staff. </p>
<p>Since then, Libya has taken a number of measures against Switzerland. Two Swiss businessmen, were detained and prevented from leaving the country for more than a year. Last week, they were sentenced to 16 months in jail for visa violations.</p>
