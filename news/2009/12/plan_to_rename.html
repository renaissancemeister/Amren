<h1>Plan to Rename Street for Sean Bell Draws Some Criticism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Grace Rauh, NY1, December 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Although the City Council is expected to approve a plan to rename a Queens street after police shooting victim Sean Bell, some politicians and law enforcement agents are criticizing the measure. NY1&rsquo;s Grace Rauh filed the following report.</p>
<p>Some members of the City Council want to rename Liverpool Street in Jamaica, Queens &#8220;Sean Bell Way,&#8221; as a way to mark the site where an unarmed man was shot and killed by police officers on his wedding day in 2006.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a recognition of his life and what his life meant. We have no idea what that young man could have become,&#8221; said Queens Councilman Thomas White.</p>
<p>The City Council is set to vote on the proposal on Monday, after a council committee approved it on Thursday as part of 70 new street names.</p>
<p>Yet some officials are balking at the plan. President Michael Palladino of the Detectives&rsquo; Endowment Association said that Bell was drunk and used a car as a deadly weapon on the night of his death, and also noted that Bell had a criminal record.</p>
<p>In 2008, three police officers were acquitted in connection with the shooting, including two who were charged with manslaughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision to rename a street after Sean Bell is an insult to the law-abiding citizens of our city, to the youth of our city, and of course to the law enforcement community,&#8221; said Palladino.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measure has the support of Council Speaker Christine Quinn and is expected to be approved by the full council and Mayor Michael Bloomberg is also expected to sign the bill. An aide said the mayor doesn&rsquo;t veto street renamings.<br>

<p>He might have been ambitious and graduated to white collar crime, or gone for the gold and become a murderer! </p>
<p>Yet his life was tragically cut short. What a pity.</p>

		<p>Because this is a matter of a street name, I don&rsquo;t feel the need to form an opinion based on guilt or innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, as I did until the poster toto told me about the rape kit given to the woman Kobe Bryant raped (as I now think he did) right after the rape.  </p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s simply a matter of the word of the family of an average NYC black man, and NYC black city council members, versus the word of law enforcement.  I give the benefit of the doubt to the cops if it&rsquo;s a matter of he said he said.  Therefore, I would not name the street after Mr. Bell.</p>

<p> I got a fairly good idea of what his life would have become, I think we all do.</p>

		<p>Can you imagine whites asking for a Jack The Ripper Court or a John Dillinger Drive?  Do the Jews want a Meyer Lansky Lane?  I think the Orientals should fight for a Pol Pot Place. Ugh.  We are doomed.</p>

		<p>Anyone who followed the press coverage at the time will quickly recognize the degree to which this article soft peddles Sean Bell and his buds&rsquo; involvement. The cops were guilty of excessive restraint, not excessive force. I know who I would name a street after, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be old Sean.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with naming a street after a drunk driver with a criminal record?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look at all the cities in the country who have streets named after an adulterer, womanizer, plaigerist and possible communist.</p>
<p>By comparison, a petty criminal that gets drunk and tries to run over people is a model citizen.</p>
<p>I would require his photograph to be posted on the street sign as well, one that showed him behind the wheel of his vehicle, his eyes bloodshot and out of focus, with his rap sheet posted right beside it.</p>
<p>Yesh, something the kids could look up to, instead of black pimps driving purple Cadillacs.</p>

		<p>Some people just don&rsquo;t know how to take a joke.  Obviously there will be no street named for this punk.  This is all just some white right-wing trick to get everyone worked up.  Why, I bet there are black folks right now trying to stop this nonsense.  Want to bet?</p>

		<p>It makes absolute sense. Next we can rename a street in Times Square for Raymond &#8220;Ready&#8221; Martinez&#8221;, after all we do not know what he might have become. What about the jerk that tripped on his own pants and fell to his death after committing three murder&rsquo;s? He surely is deserving of a street named for him. New York would then be a City with most of it&rsquo;s street&rsquo;s named for the cream of the crop of the non white commumity.</p>

		<p>Maybe we could just institute a policy where each black that is killed, by his own kind or by police, a star on the pavement as do the stars in Hollywierd have their own walk with their stars.</p>
