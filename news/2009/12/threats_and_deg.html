<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The federal government&rsquo;s border fence has been called the Tortilla Curtain. But in the swamp of border politics, there&rsquo;s a more effective barrier at play, one that filters ideas rather than people. It explains why most Americans still don&rsquo;t fully understand the disaster on our southern border.</p>
<p>This tortilla curtain is propped up by much of the major media, activist groups and cheap-labor-addicted businesses, big and small. They&rsquo;re all spinning us, for their own reasons.</p>
<p>But the list includes the feds, too.</p>
<p>More than anything, bureaucrats want to convince you of the great job they&rsquo;re doing. If the facts say otherwise, they&rsquo;ll sanitize, sugar-coat and sometimes suppress  &mdash;  which a Utah congressman believes has been the case with two blockbuster studies, 7 and 5 years old, that have never seen daylight, until now.</p>
<p>The Bush administration&rsquo;s Department of the Interior did both. They were intended to measure the impacts of illegal immigration and drug-smuggling on Interior Department-managed lands in Arizona.</p>
<p>The first, from 2002, was a threat assessment for such places as Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and the Tohono O&rsquo;odham Nation.</p>
<p>It concluded the threat was great indeed, both from the surge of aliens and drug smugglers who are &#8220;decimating public resources,&#8221; and from the invitation the open border offered terrorists.</p>
<p>The study said bad guys could easily cross into Arizona using established trails and a pre-existing labor pool of $10-a-day mules who &#8220;do not care, or want to know, what they are smuggling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second study, from 2004, looked at how the open border impacted Sonoran Desert wilderness in southwest Arizona, mainly Organ Pipe. This picture was equally grim  &mdash;  for the land, for endangered species and for the whole concept of border wilderness.</p>
<p>Both studies noted that the Border Patrol policy of blocking entry around cities and border ports pushed this illegal activity into remote areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The wilderness study in particular was handled oddly. It was presented at a 2004 meeting of a borderlands managers&rsquo; group of public officials who gather regularly in Tucson to talk about border issues.</p>
<p>Fred Patton, one of the study&rsquo;s authors and former chief ranger at Organ Pipe, made the presentation. No one in the room was given a hard copy of the content.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought this study was going to be great to show the impacts,&#8221; says Graves, now a liaison between Forest Service and the Secure Border Initiative. &#8220;But we never heard about it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congressman Rob Bishop, ranking Republican on the Parks and Public Lands Subcommittee, first heard about the desert wilderness study in April, and began asking the Obama administration&rsquo;s Interior Department for a copy.</p>
<p>It finally came, after 10 weeks, when Bishop gave the study&rsquo;s verbatim title to the Interior Department. He says he was stonewalled and sees the delay as a pattern that makes him mad as hell {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Daniel Wirth, who did the threat assessment, said his study was &#8220;law-enforcement sensitive,&#8221; and it apparently still is. When pressed with more questions, Wirth said he needed permission from his bosses at the Interior Department, where he&rsquo;s southwest border coordinator for law enforcement and security. But that permission didn&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As Bishop wrangled with Interior to get the wilderness study, he also acquired the threat assessment. His reaction to both?</p>
<p>&#8220;I was flabbergasted,&#8221; says Bishop. &#8220;I could not imagine any situation as dangerous and threatening to this country as what we&rsquo;re seeing along the border, especially in Arizona. Any country, to be sovereign, has to at least control its land. You cannot turn over areas to drug cartels, with the potential of terrorists coming through, and that is the situation we have on the southern border.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bishop believes we are sacrificing public lands on the border to the wilderness designation. By restricting Border Patrol&rsquo;s access to border wilderness, we effectively turn these lands over to bad guys, leading to their degradation. He made that case in The Washington Times on Nov. 16.</p>

		<p>I have concluded that 99.9% of all terrorist are not interested in commiting terrorism in America.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it is so childishly simple to accomplish, if they wanted to do it, it would have been done a thousand times over by now.</p>
<p>How?  The border is an open door.  All terrorists have to do is waltz across packing whatever they want, and set up shop anywhere really.</p>
<p>This basic truth makes Bush&rsquo;s claim to have prevented terrorism seem childish and ridiculous.  Terrorists could have attacked  this nation anytime from within if they wanted to.</p>
<p>Terrorism was never stopped.  They just never elected to attack targets in this country.  The proof of that is that no terrorism occurred.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>

		<p>Ice:</p>
<p>What makes you think they haven&rsquo;t waltzed across the border and set up shop?  The reason they haven&rsquo;t struck is because, unlike a certain other domestic minority, they&rsquo;re patient people.  They&rsquo;ll wait as long as they need to, across as many generations as necessary.  They&rsquo;ll only strike when the time and place is right.</p>

		<p>Yes, I have to agree with your point.  It seems that coordinated small scale terrorist attacks by Muslims within a relatively short time frame would only infuriate the American public and cause a gargantuan retaliatory response from us which the terrorists realize.</p>
<p>I think the better terrorist option is to just keep importing 3rd worlders and have our government keep printing money to take care of them.  When the monetary system collapses and social chaos ensues, then maybe Muslims have a better chance of taking control of our country or at least a piece of it. </p>

		<p>Not only that it would be incredibly simple to do, but that the Bush white house made amazingly stupid an irresponsible media statements to the bubbleheads at Fox and CNN. Dick Cheney and his ranting about Americans being in a constant danger zone. Why would you reiterate that point if what you said about attacking Iraq and Afghanistan was supposedly going to end that threat? Maybe they though alot of Americans were stupid (maybe so), but they didn&rsquo;t fool me. Even when I liked Lou Dobbs&rsquo; message about terrorists possibly sneaking across the borders&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think the wealthy Arabs wanted to be in a cess pool nation of Mestizos either. </p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, pay no attention to the current Undocumented Migrants&rsquo; Commissar behind the Great Oz&rsquo;s &ldquo;tortilla curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is nothing to be alarmed by, he simply gives off a rainbow of confusion. </p>
<p>If these little brown Mexchkins didn&rsquo;t come here, who would do our work for us; or for that matter, rape and kill us? That would be an unfair burden to bestow upon blacks, would it not?  They too have much bad publicity as it is, via the current Civil Rights&rsquo; Commissar behind the Great Oz&rsquo;s chitterling curtain. Bad publicity is the worst, I know and so do my flying monkeys!</p>
<p>Just look at this hateful propaganda hit-piece the current Wizard of Oz has distributed against me:</p>

		<p>This is another subtle, but serious, border issue.  Raul Grijalva, whose power base is heavily Mexican South Tucson, wants to designate several parcels of federal land on the border as &#8220;wilderness&#8221;.  These lands are not wilderness.  They are, in fact, highways, garbage dumps, marjuana transhipment stations, and brothels for illegal border crossers.  They are also where left wing groups, many affiliated with church groups, set up aid stations to assist the border crossers as the travel north.  </p>
<p>Designating these lands &#8220;wilderness&#8221; will not preserve their natural character - that has already been lost.  What it will do is prevent the border patrol from using vehicles or installing sensors and cameras to stop the illegals and smugglers.</p>

<p>Skip the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;.it will happen soon with the dirth of home grown black muslim converts willing to do the deed along with our relentless importation of Somalis KNOW to do these deeds. Our turn is coming, and 9/11 will pale when it happens.</p>

<p>Maybe we should start a video campaign, sending dvd&rsquo;s to everyone in this country, showing the real stuff going on down there.  If watching the news is too boring for them, maybe a video, reality tv style will capture their attention.  <br>
But then again, I doubt it.</p>
