<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2009-12-01-underbanked_N.htm">Report: Many Minorities Shun Banks</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martha T. Moore, USA Today, December 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than one in four American households, including more than half of black households, use check cashers, payday lenders or pawnbrokers rather than a bank, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report to be released today.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 million households have no bank account or have one but also use alternate financial services at least occasionally, according to the FDIC report. The survey, the FDIC&rsquo;s first in-depth study of the issue, was conducted by the Census Bureau.</p>
<p>The problem is most acute among minorities: 53% of African-American households and 43% of Hispanic households use check cashers or similar services instead of or in addition to banks.</p>
<p>Buying money orders and cashing checks are the most frequent transactions, the survey shows. Those using check cashers and other services say they are faster, cheaper and more convenient than banks  &mdash;  even though they pay a fee to cash a check they could deposit in a bank account for free.</p>
<p>The FDIC wants banks to win back those customers, saying consumers should have the benefit of insured savings and be able to build a credit history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sidestepping banks is more common in the South, among single heads-of-households and among people under age 45.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The FDIC will use the data in its effort to persuade more banks to offer &#8220;starter accounts,&#8221; low-cost, no-minimum checking accounts without automatic overdraft programs that can result in customers getting hit with fees if they go in the red. One option, Gruenberg said, is to offer incentives to banks through the Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages banks to do business in low- and moderate-income communities.</p>
<p>Banks already are required to offer low- and no-cost checking, but a 2008 FDIC survey showed that 77% of large banks use automated overdraft programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Profitability shouldn&rsquo;t be the only criteria for seeking the customers, said Valerie Wilson of the National Urban League Policy Institute, which advocates for access to banks in low-income communities. &#8220;There has to be a greater responsibility for the community in which banks are located.&#8221;</p>

		<p>1. The banks, as private corporations (for now) have a RESPONSIBILITY to their shareholders to make a profit, so they can stay in business.</p>
<p>2. Blacks can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t do math. A black (female, especially) with a checkbook will write bad checks as long as someone will take them. Establishments in the ghetto will generally NOT take checks because of this.</p>
<p>3. If low-class blacks want to make white folks who run check cashing business a bunch of money, what does that hurt?</p>

		<p>These places allow them to engage in a wide variety of illegal behaviors without leaving a paper trail&hellip;.especially tax evasion and conversion of welfare into drug funds.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, it would be a very good idea to simply make such places illegal and FORCE these people to use a bank.</p>

		<p>Many minorities don&rsquo;t use banks because they&rsquo;ve screwed up their accounts with overdrafts they&rsquo;ve never made good on.  Pushing them to get accounts is about as brilliant as were the schemes to provide mortgages for people who couldn&rsquo;t afford them.  There&rsquo;s no way that paying for and making out money orders is more convenient than writing a check or paying online, so most of the people who do so probably can&rsquo;t get a bank account because of previous bad behavior.</p>

		<p>Two theories of mine why this is:</p>
<p>(1)  They&rsquo;re concealing ill-gotten money, such as drugs, or something they need to keep hidden from welfare social workers.  Assets in banks are easily trackable.</p>
<p>(2)  Banks are getting so insane and obnoxious with their monthly fees and NSM fees, often times not the account holder&rsquo;s fault, that it&rsquo;s cheaper to use check cashing businesses and money orders.</p>

<p>It is NO business of the FDIC to decide how people handle their money. </p>
<p>The FDIC will use the data in its effort to persuade more banks to offer &ldquo;starter accounts,&rdquo; low-cost, no-minimum checking accounts without automatic overdraft programs that can result in customers getting hit with fees if they go in the red.</p>
<p>And just take a wild guess who those costs will be passed on to!</p>
<p>Look, there are many reasons banks don&rsquo;t do business in &#8220;low income communities&#8221;, but nobody will stand up and say it for fear of being called a &#8220;racissss&#8221;. There are also many reasons blacks don&rsquo;t use banks as has been stated above in posts 1,2,3 and 4. I knew a black couple that made over 100k a year that payed every one of their bills with MONEY ORDERS. The woman worked with me and didn&rsquo;t even trust automatic deposit. She always said, &#8220;I wants to SEE my check&#8221;.</p>

		<p>A (Black) secretary where I used to work explained why she (and many of her peers) refused to get a bank account for direct deposit of their paychecks. She said, &#8220;If I have money in a bank account, people will take it.&#8221; </p>
<p>By &#8220;people take will take it,&#8221; she meant &#8220;creditors will expect me to pay for stuff I don&rsquo;t even use.&#8221; So yes, if you have no intention of paying some or all of your bills, a bank probably is not the best place to keep your money.</p>

Blacks just want their money now to spend immediately.</p>
<p>For example, we had one black guy who showed up to pick up his check and proudly announced that &#8216;by noon, I&rsquo;ll be all messed up&rsquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the black mindset on money and immediate gratification.</p>

		<p>Well there was once a time when I would have also sneered and laughed at ignorant people shunning banks but now I am shunning them somewhat myself. Those of us who actually try hard to be responsible and have some savings know that the artificially non-existent interests rates have made a mockery of our cash savings.  </p>
<p>Back in the hey day of the British Empire there was a class of people called the three per-centers who were the trust fund babies of the day.  They could live comfortably off of a reliable 3% interest rate from the Bank of England on a cash investment.  That was because they had a responsible government that realized that the protection of the value of the British pound was as much a part of national security as fighting fuzzy wuzzies across the globe.</p>
<p>The current American government and our banking system has grossly inflated the money system causing the destruction of the value of the dollar in a devils bargain between the elites banksters self enrichment and the Obamanista&rsquo;s communist wealth redistribution schemes that are shoveling dollars into the ghetto from Uncle Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;private stash&#8221; of money.  The orgy of spending has not just indebted our children, its resultant devaluation in the value of our savings has combined with the destruction of home values evaporated the life savings of the middle class.   </p>
<p>Never before have we lived under such a perfect storm of ignorance by the masses and thievery by the elites.  Leaving your money in the banks where it can conveniently become more digital zeroes to be manipulated by the government while it produces almost nothing in rate of return isn&rsquo;t doing us any favors.  Some of the libertarians over a Lew Rockwell have suggested that cash hording keeps the banks from inflating the money by using the cash deposits to &#8220;create&#8221; digital money to loan out and is one way that you can work against the immoral destruction of the value of our currency.  If you are in the position to have it or make it now cash is king. </p>

		<p>I wonder if the day will ever arrive when blacks must take responsibility over their own lives?  They squeal and demand equality while shunning its responsibility.  No wonder they remain on the bottom of the economic ladder while immigrants surpass them in less than one generation.</p>

		<p>What a joke!! I was counsel to a local bank. We had to show every 90 days the number of loans we made to minorities and the reach out efforts we made to the black? community. We never bounced a check from a black or Hispanic until we gave them a call and if that was unsuccessful which it was about 90% of the time, we mailed them a letter asking them to come in and talk to us. This never worked so when we bounced their checks they acted true to form and raged into the lobby calling us Jew crackers.<br>
     We started a program to teach them how to balance thier check books. This was a waste of time, so we started a program that we would balance them for them if they brought them in.This didn`t work because they never wrote down anything when they gave a check.<br>
     They hate checking accounts because these can be seized for child support or taxes. They did like the candy in the lobby. We had to fill up the bowls at least five times a day during the first week of the month. We tried a new direct deposit program for county employees where we would pay utilitiy bills and child support. Within 90 days all the blacks opted out.<br>

		<p>I used to work in a check cashing store on Canal Street in New Orleans. The vast majority of our customers were black, and most of them had a checking account   &mdash;   or they used to have a checking account. The screwed them up with so many overdrafts that the bank closed them, or they had a negative balance because of overdraft fees. One young woman who was cashing a $350 paycheck told me that she couldn&rsquo;t deposit it in her bank because she owed them over $800 in overdraft fees.</p>

<p>This whole topic is a joke.  Most of the major banks are already insolvent and only kept alive through government welfare aka the TARP program.</p>
<p>In fact as Elizabeth Warren head of the TARP oversight commitee has reported time and time again we have no idea where that money has gone:</p>
