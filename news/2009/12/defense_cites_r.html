<h1><a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/military/Accused_shooter_Hasan_kept_from_reading_Quran_in_Arabic.html">Defense Cites Rights Violation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Guillermo Contreras, San Antonio Express-News, December 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The lead lawyer for Fort Hood shooting suspect Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan said Monday that he believes the Army is violating Hasan&rsquo;s religious rights because it prohibited him from praying from the Quran in Arabic with a relative.</p>
<p>Attorney John P. Galligan said he learned that police guarding Hasan at Brooke Army Medical Center cut short a phone conversation Hasan was having with one of his brothers on Friday because Hasan was not speaking in English.</p>
<p>&#8220;Police at the hospital refused to let him pray, in Arabic, from the Quran with his brother,&#8221; Galligan said. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s illegal and a violation of his religious rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hasan practices Islam, a religion whose followers hold that Jumu&rsquo;ah (Friday) prayers are one of its most strongly affirmed duties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His [Hasan&rsquo;s] command, the Army&rsquo;s III Corps at Fort Hood in Killeen, has imposed pretrial restrictions on him, including a requirement that he speak only in English with visitors or those he talks to on the phone unless an Army-approved translator is present.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s under military control,&#8221; said Jeffrey Addicott, a former Judge Advocate General&rsquo;s Corps officer for 20 years, who now heads the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary&rsquo;s University School of Law. &#8220;They can put reasonable restrictions on his movements and activities. The question is what is reasonable. In light of the fact that he is clearly influenced by radical jihad, in my opinion, it&rsquo;s entirely reasonable to limit his spoken activities to English.&#8221;</p>
<p>English is Hasan&rsquo;s primary language, and he learned Arabic later in life, according to news accounts. Addicott argued that because Arabic is not Hasan&rsquo;s primary language and there may not be Arabic-speaking guards available, the military is justified in its restrictions.</p>

		<p>Gee, his victims can not pray, speak or sing in ANY language and I should feel bad for this skunk?  We are violating his rights?  The Army should be allowed to follow their rules and if they don&rsquo;t want him plotting to kill more people with his brother in Arabic so be it.  In fact his family members should all be under constant surveillance if not in custody!<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t Allah smart enough to listen to private prayers in the mind, thought in Arabic?  Evidently, Allah has nothing on the Christian God.</p>
<p>Perhaps the other reason is that the things he is praying for don&rsquo;t translate well into Arabic.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know.  Maybe I&rsquo;m confused but, among Jews and Christians, when a man says he&rsquo;s &#8220;found God&#8221;, it means he&rsquo;s going to STOP killing.  Is it the opposite among Muslims?  I mean, when a Muslim says he&rsquo;s &#8220;found Allah&#8221;, does that mean he&rsquo;s now going to START killing?</p>
<p>So here we are worried about the religious rights of a mass murderer - and he&rsquo;ll probably win this one - and now Americans are not only going to pay for this particular &#8220;diversity&#8221; with their lives but the friends and relatives of his victims are going to be forced to pay for a translator so that  he can pray in Arabic.  That&rsquo;s just sick!</p>

		<p>Hopefully, the military at least has had it with PC wrecking morale and the safety of troops.  And, no doubt, ANYONE who understands Arabic can be considered untrustworthy, so even guards are liable to pass on info from Hassan to other terrorists.  </p>

<p>Not necessarily true 4  &mdash;  olewhitelady, I am a White male involved in this war for 6 years now, I speak conversational Arabic and am learning to read/Write it because I feel that NO muslim is trustworthy, especially American black converts. I am White, 6&rsquo;5&#8221; tall and weigh 245lbs and the Arabs I am around, with few exceptions, have no idea I speak the language as well as I do and I HEAR things!</p>

		<p>His attorney and his attorney&rsquo;s family should be ostracized from his community for being such a dishonorable traitor to this country. To openly and wantonly spit in the face of all those in mourning is obscene. Concerning the use of arabic, his last words can be in any language he desires. </p>
