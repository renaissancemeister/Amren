<h1>Aloha, Segregation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wall Street Journal, December 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama speaks proudly of his childhood in Hawaii, so we wonder what the state&rsquo;s voters think of his support for a bill that would redistribute its wealth based on race. That&rsquo;s what would happen under the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, which Congress is trying to sneak through in its final days this year.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Senator Daniel Akaka, the bill would transfer a percentage of public-owned lands to a native Hawaiian government within the state of Hawaii. The legislation would collect some 400,000 ethnic Hawaiians scattered across the country into a newly affiliated tribe, eventually endowed with the powers of a sovereign state, including freedom from state taxes and regulations and separate police power.</p>
<p>Proponents say the plan would duplicate the legal scenario set up for Native Americans, but the Akaka bill carves out new territory. Unlike Indian tribes made up of tightly knit populations that have lived together continuously, participation in the new group would be available to nearly anyone able to trace their roots back to a Native Hawaiian ancestor, no matter where they now reside. U.S. Civil Rights Commission member Gail Heriot told Congress in June that, &#8220;If ethnic Hawaiians can be accorded tribal status, why not Chicanos in the Southwest? Or Cajuns in Louisiana?&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the Akaka bill, someone will have to divine exactly who qualifies as a Native Hawaiian. In the bill&rsquo;s current version, the determination would be handled by a nine member commission staffed by experts in native Hawaiian genealogy. That, says the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, amounts to racial discrimination and would &#8220;subdivide the American People into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} In [the Supreme Court&rsquo;s] 2000 decision in Rice v. Cayetano, the Court held that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs could not hold elections limited to ethnic Hawaiians. &#8220;Ancestry can be a proxy for race,&#8221; the court wrote, &#8220;and is that proxy here.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} According to Tom MacDonald at Aloha for All, which opposes the Akaka bill, original demands included the transfer of all lands taken by the U.S. government including military bases and national parks which could be leased back at market value.</p>
<p>With some 38% of the state falling under public ownership and thus theoretically available for transfer, the benefits accruing to racial Hawaiians could be significant. {snip} According to a study by the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii and the Beacon Hill Institute, the total amount of state tax and land lease revenue lost annually could range from $342.8 million to $689.7 million, depending on the percentage of public land ceded to the project.</p>
<p>The state could also expect to lose as many as 20,000 private sector jobs and more than $200 million in investment. The burden will fall on non-Native taxpayers, costing the average taxpayer between $705 and $1,461 in real disposable income a year.</p>
<p>{snip} According to a Zogby poll this week, a majority of Hawaiians oppose the bill and 76% oppose higher taxes to pay for the new nation tribe. {snip}</p>

		<p>I think this is the foreshadowing of the future of the American southwest.  While it may not formally secede, will it really matter?  Let me put it to you this way:  East St. Louis, IL, is still part of the United States.  But do you want to go live there?  And that is AZ/NM/TX future, one big Hispanic barrio, whose Hispanic leaders will demand sweetheart ethnic enclaves/slush funds like the Kanaka Moali are demanding from the Feds right now for HI.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Bill in Congress would make native Hawaiians a sovereign Indian tribe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does that mean they would have their governments blessing then to attack, beat, rob and murder whitey whenever they feel like it instead of doing it just part-time?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of giving them the whole state and declaring it sovereign and wishing them good luck at being on their own.  Maybe China will support them, but I doubt the will be able to do it.</p>
<p>Somehow I think they will wind up hating, killing and fighting with each other more than they did with whitey, whom they utterly despise.</p>

		<p>The more I ponder this issue of Hawaiian sovereignty, the more I find myself feeling more than a little sympathy for the native Hawaiian cause.</p>
<p>I look around and see an ever-increasing amount of Spanish-language directions on product labels, Spanish-language instructions on public busses, Spanish-language publications issued by federal, state, and county departments, understanding that this mandatory bilingualism has absolutely no public support here, yet it continues.</p>
<p>An endless parade of public and private commentators ceaselessly urge me to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; my linguistic, racial, and civilizational displacement, to admire the alleged &#8220;vibrancy&#8221; of the unwanted newcomers, to view all that my ancestors and my fellow &#8220;native&#8221; (Ha!) Americans have created as &#8220;boring&#8221; and &#8220;whitebread&#8221;, and I am not to comment on this unless I follow the official party line and emote as to how wonderful, how positive, how inevitable, all these changes are.  </p>
<p>In my only homeland, there are now neighborhoods, cities, counties, and large and increasing parts of whole states where I am not welcome to live, as the floodtide of immigrants, invaders, to be more accurate, remakes what was once America into something foreign and alien.</p>
<p>It was the native Hawaiian ruling class, the Ali&rsquo;i,  that invited the missionaries and the plantation workers in, the great mass of Maka&rsquo;ainana (commoners) having absolutely no say in the matter. Presumably these overlords thought they&rsquo;d always remain in control, assimilating some of the more pleasant customs of the aliens, but keeping political power. Of course, it didn&rsquo;t work out that way, just as a century, or less, from now our own overlords will be rudely shoved aside, politically, culturally, and economically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the average Hawaiian of 200 years ago never wanted his society to irrevocably change into something unrecognizable, just as the average American of today does not want to see similar changes in our society.</p>
<p>So I do feel some sympathy for the descendants of the ancient Polynesians, proud voyagers who spread their civilization over millions of square miles of trackless ocean, who today live in squalor twelve to a four room house, or in a tent on a beach, on land that used to belong to them, but who gave up ownership generations ago.</p>
<p>I do not support this blind rage so many Hawaiians have toward white people, often expressed in violent and unprovoked attacks on Whites (why do they never express such sentiments to the descendants of the equally non-indigeneous Japanese immigrants, who are, after all, the ones who rule Hawaii economically and politically today?).</p>
<p>And considering that virtually all &#8220;Hawaiians&#8221; are actually mixed-race, this focus on a &#8220;blood quantum&#8221; seems schizophrenic, having to downplay or deny a significant part of one&rsquo;s own genetic makeup.</p>
<p>So I do sympathize with the loss of language, of culture, of power, of nationhood, that the Native Hawaiians have had to deal with. I just think they&rsquo;re going about finding solutions the wrong way.</p>
<p>And I do not want my own civilization to end up that way. Not that my own governing elites allow me to have any say in the matter.</p>

Cut Hawaii adrift. We have no claim to that place, and would be better off with out it.<br>

		<p>BTW, the Hawaiian language is making a comeback in Hawaii. there are immersion Hawaiian language schools to teach the language to the next generation. I grew up in Hawaii, all the ethnic groups did not like whites and treated them badly in schools. Why should not Native Hawaiians be treated the same as Native Americans and Alaska Natives?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m all for it.  Give &#8216;em the big Island, or all of them, and independence.   I&rsquo;m gagged by &#8220;conservatism&rsquo;s&#8221; fake outrage over this.  &#8220;The Wall Street Journal&#8221; is one of the biggest boosters of open borders and internationalism out there,  and this is in  support of a policy of open borders,  multiculturalism, and &#8220;free trade&#8221; aimed squarely at mainland, white America.   They make their money manipulating paper, words, laws,  and figures and old-fashion ideas like nation, culture, patriotism, kin, economic sovereignty and borders just get in the way.  </p>

I live in New Jersey.  Please tell me how I too can get special rights and personal federal funding for my tribe.  We can be identified as white, taxpaying and law abiding.  We would like to be afforded minority status and protected to preserve our dwindling culture.</p>

		<p>It would be a mistake to think that Indian tribes are always  cohesive cultural units. Many who have been accorded status as a member of this or that tribe may be descended from other tribes as well, and share a household with a man or woman of another tribe. Members of a tribe may have no close relatives on reservation land, and may not have associations with other tribe members other than with their immediate family.</p>

		<p>A casual reader may assume that the extension of additional privileges to Hawaiians will be borne by White taxpayers within the state. Actually, it will be more analogous to Puerto Rico where the White tax payer in Idaho helps sustain the good life for many Puerto Ricans through the use of federal tax dollars. <br>

<p>Well, this is correct. This secessionist group is driven by HATE. Hate for whitey and all that is whitey. A HATE group that is hardly democratic or republican or anything like that. </p>
<p>This &#8220;group&#8221; would not only discriminate against anyone that is not &#8220;them&#8221; but do so in an egregious manner. Violence and the use of force against anyone other than &#8220;them&#8221; is a strong possible.</p>
<p>Keep in mind too that about half of those folks claiming to be &#8220;Hawaiian&#8221; live in the mainland, the forty-eight contiguous states. They too will be exempt from local laws, taxes, etc.?</p>
<p>And those so-called &#8220;chicanos&#8221; that want to destroy the U.S. have a lot of affinity for the &#8220;Hawaiians&#8221;. Support them and encourage them.</p>
<p>This Akaka is a plain old ordinary bad guy! Malevolent intentions agaainst whitey everywhere and anywhere.</p>

		<p>Assuming that Obama WAS born in Hawaii, he was sharp enough to realise that he had no political future in a State where political power is very firmly in Japanese-American hands.</p>
<p>Shrewdly, the Japanese-Americans of Hawaii [or Hawai&rsquo;i to purists, like the people in the University of Hawai&rsquo;i] have made sure that the Polynesians have been kept sweet towards the East Asian settlers, reserving ALL their hostility for whites.</p>
<p>Would the Contiguous United States, the &#8216;Lower Forty-Eight&rsquo;, be richer or poorer without Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d guess the answer would be a resounding YES, but the inhabitants of those two States and the other four waifs would be very unwilling to kiss goodbye to the unending subsidies they receive from the American taxpayer.</p>
<p>In precisely the same manner, England would be FAR richer without Wales, Scotland and Norn Iron; as the shrewder inhabitants of those places know very well. </p>
<p>Ditto France and Corsica.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right about all except Alaska, which has <a href="http://www.akip.org/" rel="nofollow">a large and long-standing independence movement</a>. With its abundant natural resources, Alaska would likely be better off without the US holding it down. I still stand by my prediction that Alaska will be the first state to secede when the final collapse of the US begins. The &#8220;invincible&#8221; US Army can&rsquo;t control a country the size of Texas (Afghanistan); Alaska is more than twice as big, is even more mountainous, and its climate is much harsher.</p>
