<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Voters strongly believe that black-white relations are better today  &mdash;  and improving  &mdash;  but are much less confident about the social situation with Hispanics.</p>
<p>A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 80% of voters think relations between white Americans and black Americans are better today than they were in the 1960s. Just 11% say that isn&rsquo;t so.</p>
<p>Sixty-two percent (62%) also feel that relations between black and white Americans are getting better. Twenty percent (20%) say that relationship is getting worse, and 11% see it as about the same as it always has been.</p>
<p>However, just 40% of voters nationwide say relations between white Americans and Hispanics are getting better. Nearly as many (34%) say they are getting worse. Fifteen percent (15%) see no change.</p>
<p>Voters are even more pessimistic about the relationship between African-Americans and Hispanics.</p>
<p>Eighteen percent (18%) say it&rsquo;s getting better, but twice as many (36%) say relations between the two are getting worse. Twenty percent (20%) say neither is the case, while another 26% are not sure.</p>
<p>The numbers on white-black relations are virtually unchanged from late July at the height of the national debate over the arrest of a black Harvard professor by a white Cambridge, Massachusetts policeman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Twenty-one percent (21%) of voters believe there is more discrimination these days against Hispanics than against blacks or women. Just 11% feel that blacks are more discriminated against. Twenty-seven percent (27%) say women are the more discriminated against of the three groups. Forty-one percent (41%) are not sure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A sore point for many Hispanics is the national debate over illegal immigration. By a 70% to 22% margin, voters say that gaining control of the borders is more important than legalizing the status of undocumented workers already in the country.</p>
<p>What is often lost in the debate over immigration reform, however, is that once the borders are controlled, most Americans favor a welcoming immigration policy provided it is done within the law. By a 55% to 27% margin, Americans favor a policy goal that would welcome everyone except criminals, national security threats and welfare dependants.<br>

		<p>Another misleading poll. I too, would say, if asked, that Black-White relations are better. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I like blacks or want anything to do with them. It&rsquo;s just the brainwashing that&rsquo;s working, that&rsquo;s all. </p>

<p>That pretty much leaves out everyone save other whites.  But even that isn&rsquo;t good enough for me, because a lot of those non-criminal non-national security threat and non-welfare dependent immigrants include legal post-1965 minorities who contribute to the racial and economic dispossession of native born white Americans.  And if I don&rsquo;t stop parroting Jupiter&rsquo;s words, he&rsquo;s going to demand royalties.</p>
<p>My immigration policy would explicitly limited to those who are:  (1) Identifiably Caucasian, and (2) From countries and cultures with similar wage, salary and standard of living expectations as American whites, so that they can&rsquo;t be used as corporate pawns to dilute the standard of living of native born white Americans.</p>
<p>As for black-white relations, the reason they tend to be good is because they tend not to exist.  If there were actually more relations, there would be more animosity.  Nothing cures the thirst for integration like a good dose of integration.  That&rsquo;s where the liberals shoot themselves in the foot with their demands for urban sprawl boundaries   &mdash;   if you force most whites to live around blacks, they will inevitably resent blacks, and vote for whatever political party the blacks vote for.</p>

		<p>Who are these 80% of voters who say black/White relations are better?? I don&rsquo;t believe it for a second unless they are brain dead and their heads buried in the sand.</p>
<p>But I can see the White lefties saying so and even the neo-cons who are about as clueless as ever when it comes to race. If anything racial relations are ten times as bad as they ever have been. Why don&rsquo;t I ever see or get to vote in these stupid polls? </p>

		<p>That last paragraph really gets to me! Most Americans favor a &#8220;welcoming&#8221; immigration policy that welcomes &#8220;everybody&#8221; except criminals, terrorists and welfare dependents!  Oh, really I don&rsquo;t favor any NONwhite immigrant period! Also most of these 3rd world immigrants we get are ALL getting welfare in one form or another, are they not? I believe this poll is bogus (propaganda) or Americans are more further gone than I thought.</p>

		<p>This does not surprise me. The fact is that racailly concscious White men like Jared Taylor, Pat Buchanan and some of our female posters like Courtney (where has she been lately) have discussed the fact that Black Americans, for good of ill, have been a part of America from its inception, bought here largely against their own will and thus, do have some legitimate claim to citizenship.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many other ethnic minorities, including Hispanics, do not have such a moral claim.</p>

		<p>This article my be on to something. I notice that many older Whites, especially southern Whites, seem to have a better tolerance for Black than Hispanics. I think that there are a number of reasons for this, but I would argue that religion is a major factor. Chrisitaninty produces an impervious commonality. </p>

<p>I do not believe this.</p>
<p>Who would trust a telephone survey to give us any indication of how Whites feel about blacks?  This is a corollary of the Bradley Effect:  Telling the person conducting the survey the &#8216;correct&rsquo; answer so as not to appear racist or bigoted (or possibly out of fear).</p>
<p>In this current political climate, would you trust the person on the other end not to report you as a &#8216;racist&rsquo; to the government?  Would you be willing to answer questions about race from anyone you don&rsquo;t know well?</p>
<p>The best, safest course of action is to hang the phone up immediately if someone calls and asks about race.</p>

<p>When I got to the end I had to wonder if this is some sort of crank survey. Criminals, threats and welfare dependants? Doesn&rsquo;t that rule entire groups of people i.e. immigrants?<br>

		<p>To be honest, if I had to choose between Hispanics and Blacks, I would rather deal with Blacks. First of all, there is a history there. Secondly, Blacks tend to be concentrated in certain parts of the nation. You will not find large Black populations in the rocky mountain states, the dakotas etc&hellip; </p>
<p>Another factor is that despite whatever nuisnaces Blacks can be (and some of them can), we have not reached the point where Black english has become the official langauge of a major American city,(spanish is the offical language in Miami, Florida) ebonics becoming a mandated second langauage in our public schools (this is happening in more and more places. </p>
<p>You cannot go anywhere without seeing some sort of Hispanic influence. It has really become depressing. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 80% of voters think relations between white Americans and black Americans are better today than they were in the 1960s. Just 11% say that isn&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on what planet were these &ldquo;voters&rdquo; surveyed?</p>
<p>The planet of Stupidurn, or that of Moronus; or have the two crashed together recently and formed a new gas giant, Multicultopia?</p>
<p>The only reason that anyone who is white could possibly think that relations are &ldquo;better&rdquo;  between blacks and whites in this country today, is that they are: morbidly Marxist; or so brainwashed by those who are, as to make no difference. I was not even born by the 1960s, but I can still grasp that this country was much more stable racially then it is today. Indeed, there may have been race riots and other unrest, but not the wholesale slaughter and rape we see today of whites by blacks. Also, at that time, there remained some vestiges of white racial solidarity that reacted with outrage to this escalating violence against them.</p>
<p>If this were not the case, how did Nixon (with all of his political problems and personal shortcomings) get reelected with 68% of the white vote in 1972? </p>
<p>There was an overwhelming collective white reaction to the rainbow &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; trends of that time, not a meekly growing acceptance of them.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>They have GOT to be kidding? One of two things is possible:<br>
a. They interviewed Whites who have never had any up close experiences with Blacks.<br>
OR<br>
b. They interviewed Blacks who are confidentd that they have intimidated Whites to the point where they&rsquo;ve (the Whites) lost the instinct to defend themselves.</p>

		<p>80% think that white -black relations are just peachy. If you flip it on it`s head and ask about black-white relations it would be 20%. To think that blacks no longer hate the guts of all things white is liberal revisonist nonsense at it`s very worst. Black on white crime is at an all time high. Rapes, murders, maimings, and robberies have whites arming themselves as never before. A black man in the White House is okay but not one in your living room at 2 am. 80% of whites think we have made progress, the other 20% are victims, prey and know the truth.<br>

		<p>I have to wonder how many of the respondents to this poll were even alive in the Sixties.  I was, and the Watts and LA riots notwithstanding, I&rsquo;d have to say that racial relations were much better in that era.</p>
<p>Whites then were generally of a mind that blacks had been treated unfairly in a many ways and seemed far more willing to extend themselves to make amends and even create preferences for them.</p>
<p>Today most whites are simply sick of them, their clear lack of achievement, despite the endless set-asides offered them, their criminality, the endless and increasingly inventive explanations for their lack of achievement, the unvarying manner in which they destroy neighborhoods, then whole vast tracts, and finally entire cities, and the increasingly obvious costs they impose on the rest of our society.</p>
<p>I see this among friends and neighbors of my age, all of whom were highly supportive of efforts to bring them into the mainstream over four decades ago, and all of whom are now convinced that they&rsquo;re simply a hopeless species.</p>

		<p>What they mean is whites have become more tolerant, have decreased our power structure, and have become wimps when it comes to blacks, while giving blacks the upper hand to do and say whatever they want to us without impunity.  That&rsquo;s what the liberals and non-white racists definition of &#8220;racial relations improving&#8221; means.</p>

<p><br>
So VERY right-on! This country as we know it has been destroyed  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s no longer a work-in-progress but a fait accompli  &mdash;  by the sheer dead weight of a preponderance of low IQ, impulsive blacks (and browns) that we&rsquo;ve tried for forty-plus years to acculturate and accommodate without success. The cost of arresting, convicting, and incarcerating them, the disruption to our education system, and the added costs of having to quintuple security arrangements in any public place where they are present in significant numbers is just too much for any society to bear without being significantly weakened.</p>
<p>What planet are these survey participants living on? At the height of the civil rights movement, one could walk down the street alone without having to worry about being jumped whenever one encountered three or more black males in a group. Count me as one of those whites who is simply sick of them, their chronic underachievement despite every opportunity, and their hatred for all who outperform them in every endeavor!<br>

<p>I disagree.  Many blacks complain that &#8220;we were brought here as slaves&#8221; and are very ungrateful for all the efforts whites have put forth since the 60s to uplift them.  If they feel so bad about being brought here, then they can leave.</p>

		<p>I agree with most all of the commenters.<br>
except, this has been going on for more than 4 decades.<br>
In 1954 Brown vs. Dept of Education (or whatever it was then)<br>
was passed/approved by the Supreme Court&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.  <br>
I&rsquo;m not an expert on it, but it disallowed, &#8220;seperate but egual&#8221;<br>
education.  So this was 1954&hellip;..  55 years ago, and they? had worked towards this end for some amount of time.  <br>
when seperate but equal was overturned, we, usa, began the slide down in education in public schools.  I was in elementary during the 60&rsquo;s and I remember no messing around.  You sat up and learned, then, and only then, we might think about recess and parties and all the rest&hellip;.  I have taught in public schools recently, in a conservation place, and the kids are allowed to talk out whenever a thought passes through their little heads, special ed kids might roll around on the floor or have a temper tantrum whenever they felt like it.  Now, I believe there are real problems sometimes, but those problems should not be in the classroom of normal kids that need to learn.</p>
