<h1>After Walkout, Black Caucus Gets What It Wanted</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Kuhnhenn, Yahoo! News, December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By boycotting a key House committee vote last week and threatening to abandon support for banking regulations, members of the Congressional Black Caucus got $4 billion added to a Wall Street regulation bill and $2 billion to a proposed House jobs bill in spending they sought for African American communities.</p>
<p>House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass., this week inserted $3 billion to the legislation to provide low-interest loans to unemployed homeowners in danger of foreclosure. He added $1 billion for neighborhood revitalization programs.</p>
<p>The money would come out of the $700 billion financial rescue fund.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The proposed jobs bill targets $1 billion from infrastructure spending for public housing repairs. It also provides $1 billion for an affordable housing trust fund.</p>
<p>With 40 members in the House, the Congressional Black Caucus can be a potent force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the caucus&rsquo; demands were greater assistance for minority-owned auto dealerships and banks that lend in African-American communities and more government advertising in minority-owned media.</p>

		<p>Barney Frank has become the VI Lenin of the USA. He has successfully authorized the theft of trillions of dollars from the private sector, ie taxpayers, to favored beneficiaries like banks, investment houses, and low income &#8220;home owners&#8221;, ie blacks who bought huge home they couldn&rsquo;t afford and now want Uncle Sam to pay the mortgage.  Now an outright bribe to blacks is part of the Frank bailout. This man would hang in a just society. Instead he will prosper in our indulgent, amoral money counts and family doesn&rsquo;t society.</p>

		<p>Ole &lsquo;light in the loafers&rsquo; Barney is a blatant crook as transparent as a window pane.  It must be his audacious style of larceny that wins the admiration of Steny, Nancy and Barack.</p>

		<p>#1 - What makes you think they were seeking a &#8220;solution&#8221; for anything.  Or give a hoot about other blacks in the slightest?</p>
<p>That money is basically earmarked to be stolen.</p>
<p>For all the talk about blacks caring only about black issues (like this article suggests), the truth is that they basically use each other to get money out of us.</p>
<p>There will be no attempt at job creation with this money.  Not even wealth redistributed into &#8220;the black community&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s going to line the pockets of wealthy blacks.</p>
<p>Here as in africa, the main way blacks get rich is by stealing aid money.</p>

		<p>Typical of blacks.  The only way they know how to get lots of money is scream racism, intimidate whites, or sell rap music.  If they do manage to make money the honest, legal, and useful way, it&rsquo;s only through affirmative action or because of some liberal do-gooders whites with more money than brains</p>

		<p>If &#8220;Race doesn&rsquo;t exist&#8221; and &#8220;We are all the same&#8221; and &#8220;The color of a man&rsquo;s skin doesn&rsquo;t matter,&#8221; then why does a Congressional Black Caucus exist at all?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again: why isn&rsquo;t there a Congressional <i>White</i> Caucus?<br/>

		<p>Hyphenated, racist, [Americans?] once again raise their whiney parasitic voices in protest, and the cowardly, left leaning polititions succomb to their threats, rewarding them with what may soon be monopoly money, and evil ole whitey can simply get out the vaseline, and take it in the back side. But alas! fear not, there will be more tea parties, [what a joke]. As usual it&rsquo;s symbolism over substance. My advice to all the political retards, is keep on voting for the socialist democrats, and soon everyone can live in utter poverty, and we&rsquo;ll all be financial equals!! DONT YOU JUST LOVE IT?<br/>

<p>This is unconstitutional racial discrimination. It should be challenged in court.</p>
