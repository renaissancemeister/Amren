<h1><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/174093.php">Within 2 Years of First Sexual Activity Half of Urban Teen Girls Acquire STIs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Medical News Today, December 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Half of urban teenage girls may acquire at least one of three common sexually transmitted infections (STI) within two years of becoming sexually active, according to an Indiana University School of Medicine and Regenstrief Institute study.</p>
<p>The study appears in the December 2009 issue of Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.</p>
<p>The researchers followed 381 girls enrolled at ages 14 to 17 years and found that repeated infection with the organisms that cause chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis also was very common.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Within two years, about three-quarters of participants with an initial sexually transmitted STI were diagnosed with a second STI, although not necessarily of the same type. Within four years of an initial STI, virtually all (92 percent) of the participants had a subsequent STI.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study also found that screening for STI may not be initiated until several years after sexual activity begins, especially for girls with earlier onset of sexual activity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study focuses on lower income urban adolescents; a group characterized by early onset of sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, and high STI rates.</p>
<p>As a result of their findings, the researchers call for STI screening in sexually active teenage girls within a year after first intercourse and for retesting of infected girls every 3 to 4 months. Continuing surveillance may be necessary, they conclude, because of the continuing high risk of infection even if the first rescreening test result is negative.</p>

		<p>I read some facts and figures several months ago that said that something like 40% of the entire black community had herpes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an astounding figure and more of a reason to avoid them than high incidents of aids, because the disease is incurable and easily transmitted.</p>

		<p>I scratched my head when I saw the term Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) rather than the usual Diseases (STDs).</p>
<p>Did these bozos change the term due to political correctness? Perhaps they thought the word &#8220;disease&#8221; would stigmatize these poor innocents.</p>

		<p>As if there weren&rsquo;t already a thousand sound reasons whites should NOT co-mingle with blacks, this one should make it as plain as could possibly be! It must be stated simply and repeatedly - blacks are literally hazardous to the health of white people. </p>

		<p>Could the high rate of STD/STIs among black fertile women who are reluctant to get treatment a reason there are higher infant mortality and health problems in that group?</p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t speak of the unique STI that white girls get from having sex with black guys.  Wonder how many girls in THAT category come down with the fatal disease of gang rape, or it&rsquo;s similar fatal disease, murder by black boyfriend.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Urban&rdquo; is a euphemism for &ldquo;black.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t the &#8216;Urban League&rsquo; a neutral name for yet another special interest group for coloreds?</p>

		<p>Women raped by blacks are now often told to go on prophylactic treatment for HIV.  &#8220;Urban&#8221; denizens are becoming more of a pariah than ever.</p>

		<p>#2 Madison Grant:  possibly the term STI instead of STD is more accurate because some people who have an infection do not necessarily show symptoms of any disease.  This is certainly true of HIV infection, which may take years to develop into AIDS.</p>
<p>Note the phrase &#8220;early onset of sexual activity&#8221;, as if it&rsquo;s just something that happens to them, like puberty. I guess it&rsquo;s just luck, or more likely institutional racism, that saved my daughters from a similar fate.</p>

<p>Madison:</p>
<p>The acronym &#8216;STI&rsquo; has been in use for about 10 years now in the educational system.  My understanding is that &#8216;infection&rsquo; implies a condition that is &#8216;caught&rsquo; or brought about through some type of contact rather than one that arises such as cancer.  Such is the convoluted semantics of the government I recently heard a rumor that the term STI is now out of favor.  Can&rsquo;t remember the new term, but will post it when I come across it again.</p>
<p>Of course, the &#8216;latest&rsquo; textbooks I have refer to STIs as VD  &mdash;  a term that went out of use about 1975!</p>

		<p>In public health campaigns, how are the actual risks of sexual contact with blacks presented? Are they presented honestly or realistically? If your son or daughter had no other source of information than what is provided in public service announcements, would they have any basis to know that race is a major risk factor? Does the silence about the link between STDs and blacks help or harm the nation? </p>
<p>The high numbers of infected blacks subjects our society to needless risks. Should pre-schoolers be put under the care of caretakers with any number of STDs? I think not. What is the risk to those in hospitals and long term care facilities of having black healthcare workers?</p>

		<p>They keep presenting this as an &#8220;urban&#8221; problem.  Are we to think that merely the presence of large buildings means that you&rsquo;re at risk for catching an STD?  Of course it isnt, &#8220;urban&#8221; is merely a circumlocution for race.</p>
