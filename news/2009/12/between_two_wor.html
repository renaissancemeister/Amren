<h1><a href="http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=117">Between Two Worlds: How Young Latinos Come of Age in America</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pew Hispanic Center, December 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanics are the largest and youngest minority group in the United States. One-in-five schoolchildren is Hispanic. One-in-four newborns is Hispanic. Never before in this country&rsquo;s history has a minority ethnic group made up so large a share of the youngest Americans. By force of numbers alone, the kinds of adults these young Latinos become will help shape the kind of society America becomes in the 21st century.</p>
<p>This report takes an in-depth look at Hispanics who are ages 16 to 25, a phase of life when young people make choices that-for better and worse-set their path to adulthood. For this particular ethnic group, it is also a time when they navigate the intricate, often porous borders between the two cultures they inhabit-American and Latin American.</p>
<p>The report explores the attitudes, values, social behaviors, family characteristics, economic well-being, educational attainment and labor force outcomes of these young Latinos. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These are attitudes and behaviors that, through history, have often been associated with the immigrant experience. But most Latino youths are not immigrants. Two-thirds were born in the United States, many of them descendants of the big, ongoing wave of Latin American immigrants who began coming to this country around 1965.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But on a number of other measures, U.S.-born Latino youths do no better than the foreign born. And on some fronts, they do worse.</p>
<p>For example, native-born Latino youths are about twice as likely as the foreign born to have ties to a gang or to have gotten into a fight or carried a weapon in the past year. They are also more likely to be in prison.</p>
<p>The picture becomes even more murky when comparisons are made among youths who are first generation (immigrants themselves), second generation (U.S.-born children of immigrants) and third and higher generation (U.S.-born grandchildren or more far-removed descendants of immigrants).[1]</p>
<p>For example, teen parenthood rates and high school drop-out rates are much lower among the second generation than the first, but they appear higher among the third generation than the second. The same is true for poverty rates.</p>
<p><b>Identity and Assimilation</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Pew Hispanic Center&rsquo;s National Survey of Latinos, more than half (52%) of Latinos ages 16 to 25 identify themselves first by their family&rsquo;s country of origin, be it Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican Republican, El Salvador or any of more than a dozen other Spanish-speaking countries. An additional 20% generally use the terms &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; or &#8220;Latino&#8221; first when describing themselves. Only about one-in-four (24%) generally use the term &#8220;American&#8221; first.</p>
<p>Among the U.S.-born children of immigrants, &#8220;American&#8221; is somewhat more commonly used as a primary term of self-identification. Even so, just 33% of these young second generation Latinos use American first, while 21% refer to themselves first by the terms Hispanic or Latino, and the plurality-41%-refer to themselves first by the country their parents left in order to settle and raise their children in this country.</p>
<p>Only in the third and higher generations do a majority of Hispanic youths (50%) use &#8220;American&#8221; as their first term of self-description.</p>

		<p>More than 75% of Hispanics convicted of common sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, us whites could learn a thing or two from them!</p>
<p>If being an American means voting for or accepting a communist black man as president, then I&rsquo;m not an American.</p>
<p>If being an American means being in favor of or accepting whites becoming a minority in America, then I&rsquo;m not an American.</p>
<p>This one New Yawker lady charitably (she thought) ended her end of a discussion with me with the idea that we were both patriots, but singing from different hymnals.</p>
<p>I replied that no, I&rsquo;m not a patriot, and that I have no trouble saying so.</p>
<p>Completely left her speechless. As a conservative white male, you see, I&rsquo;m <i>supposed</i> to be all about &#8220;patriotism&#8221; and exhorting people to be &#8220;patriots.&#8221; And then I&rsquo;m supposed to squabble with her over the meaning of the <i>word</i>.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care whether a white person is a &#8220;patriot.&#8221;</p>
<p>I care whether they consider well that they are white.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Fewer than one-fourth of 16- to 25-year-old Hispanics identify themselves as Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anybody who might be surprised by that would have to be extraordinarily ignorant or living in a cave somewhere with no T.V.</p>
<p>The figure is actually larger than 25%, I&rsquo;m certain, because some willnot want to reveal such disloyalty and ingratitude.</p>
<p>It extends to the majority of every race in the country except for whites.</p>
<p>Any political fool who is so dumb as to expect these peole to utter a memorized oath, cross an imaginary line and automatically love him and this country needs to be incarcerated so he can no longer be a danger to the national security of this nation.</p>
<p>The American melting pot has been transformed into the squabbling boarding house of aliens that T. Roosevelt warned us about.  And this diverse empire is beginning to crack badly and is presently on the verge of disintegration, specifically because diversity has weakened us so badly we can never hope to recover.</p>
<p>Soon it will erupt into chaos on a grand scale.</p>

<p>Now, if only we could say that fewer than one-fourth of white Americans would identify Hispanic illegal immigrants as Americans.</p>

		<p>One would expect the children of criminal aliens to have high rates of illegitimacy, drop out and gang affiliation. And one wouldn&rsquo;t expect the children of those who violated US immigration laws to have any loyalty to America. Is anyone really surprised by these findings? </p>

		<p>Only 50% of third generation Hispanics call themselves &#8220;American&#8221;.  Will 50% of of the next set of third generation Hispanics call themselves American?  I doubt it.  </p>

<p>And we should not expect anything less. They listen to their radio and TV stations, fly their flags of their nations, speak their tongue, eat their foods, worship at their religious services, have their religious icons, etc.</p>
<p>And have contemptuous hatred [?] for others NOT like them?</p>

		<p>This is not a negative thing.  Eventually, it will become necessary to remove these people from the US.  Because they don&rsquo;t identify themselves as American, with the right motivation, they will leave.</p>

		<p>Matthew 12:25: &#8220;Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.&#8221;  Multiculturalism and the worship of diversity represent the age-old divide and conquer stratagem and anyone who promotes it is a traitor.  Our nation&rsquo;s greatest enemies are our own fifth-column influence-peddling politicians and rapacious businessmen…</p>
