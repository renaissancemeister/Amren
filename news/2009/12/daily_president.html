							<i>Rasmussen Reports, December 14, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>December 14, 2009: Seventy-two percent (72%) of Democrats now offer their approval while 80% of Republicans disapprove. Among voters not affiliated with either major party, just 36% approve.</p>
<p>Seventy-seven percent (77%) of liberals approve while 76% of conservatives disapprove. The bad news for the President is that there are a lot more conservatives in the country than liberals. However, he gets a bit of a boost because 57% of moderate voters still offer their approval.</p>
<p>The President earns approval from 37% of White voters and 98% of African-American voters.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Moderates&#8221; (mostly people who vote only in Presidential elections because they think it&rsquo;s their patriotic duty, and blacks, and younger people, won&rsquo;t be out in force in 2010.  Obama won&rsquo;t be on the ballot.  Therefore, the 7 point lead in a generic Congressional ballots for Republicans is probably higher.  The trouble is, real people are on a ballot, not generic names.  And this is the Stupid Party we&rsquo;re talking about here. I fully expect them to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory somehow, and their gains next November will be pitiful.  </p>

		<p>Blacks will approve of any black in office as long as he or she is liberal.  Look at Detroit.  </p>
<p>Detroit has had black &#8220;leadership&#8221; for over 40 years, and the place is now third-world in almost every respect. Only geography keeps it from full scale barbarism. And blacks in Detroit still love their amazingly incompetent and corrupt city government.  </p>

		<p>Personally, I feel that as long as blacks in Detroit (and any other major city) have the freebies rolling in, they couldn&rsquo;t care less about corruption and incompetence in government.</p>

		<p>despite the predictable collapse in OUR LEADER&rsquo;s poll numbers, the liberal integrationist media will smear any opponent of Obama as a racist and an enemy of ordinary working people. Of course Obama is the biggest enemy of white working people since John Adams and Alexander Hamilton. But Republicans lack the guts to go after free trade, the climate change lobby, Wall St and immigration as a whole. 2012 will be a great year for a nationalist, prowhite third party.</p>

<p>Since John Adams and Alexander Hamilton? Do we really have to go back that far?  Every president I have known in my lifetime is a greater enemy of white working people than whom preceded him in office. As a mere young adult I thought we had hit the bottom of the barrel with Carter, nope Reagan and his amnesty was worse, then Bush Senior came along and voila worse yet, Clinton worse still.  Then the Cocaine cowboy, dear God how can it get any worse? Oh yeah Obama! It has to be reaching bottom, how could we have anybody worse&hellip;Right?&hellip;*gulp* RIGHT?  Dear God help us! </p>

		<p>Vdare.com can&rsquo;t even fundraise $50,000 to make payroll.  Meanwhile we&rsquo;re predicting the rise of a third party that doesn&rsquo;t even exist yet in 2012 which can win an election?</p>
<p>&#8220;The 2008 campaign was the costliest in history, with a record-shattering $5.3 billion in spending by candidates, political parties and interest groups on the congressional and presidential races.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once we can fundraise 2.6 billion dollars per election I&rsquo;ll be ready to believe we can compete with the Republicans and Democrats.  We can&rsquo;t even raise $50,000.  You do the math.</p>

		<p>Alot of whites deep down knew his administration would favor blacks. Redistribution of wealth, social and economic justice are code words for preference of minorities. </p>
<p>An aside: I am unemployed. I picked one of those employment papers at the grocery store. There was an ad for Weatherization Technician trainee-one of those so called &#8220;green jobs&#8221;. I called the number to see what it was about. The first questions out of the woman&rsquo;s mouth was &#8220;What is your income for 2009?&#8221; (under $20K), &#8220;What is your gender?&#8221;, &#8220;What is your age?&#8221; (45yo) and &#8220;what is your race?&#8221; (White). She told me I did not qualify for the training program on three of the four qualifiers (45 is now a protected class) </p>
<p>Perhaps those should be called black or brown jobs.</p>

		<p>Obama and the Dems are in serious trouble.  The far left, which I thought would never even criticize a black Prez, is going for his throat.  Only blacks will continue to support him wholeheartedly.  Just look at black-run cities.  Even when the infrastructure is falling apart, police protection is almost non-existent, city services have collapsed, and mayors are charged with upteen crimes, ghetto dwellers will continue to back &#8220;their man&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>If only 37% of <i>black</i> voters approved of a <i>White</i> candidate while 98% of White voters supported him, the White voters would be smeared 24/7 as &#8220;racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somehow when non-Whites support their own, it&rsquo;s <i>never</i> Racism.</p>

		<p>As Question Diversity #1 said, mdoerate&rsquo;s, the young, and black&rsquo;s will not come out to vote in 2010 because BHO will not be on the ballot, that is the good news. But just wait until 2012, when he will be on the ballot and they will be out in drove&rsquo;s, that is the bad news. I am afraid the anti BHO force&rsquo;s in this country are getting their hope&rsquo;s up way too high and way too soon. White Guilt and minority solidarity will be hard to overcome. Unless the GOP candidate can garner at least 60% of the White Vote, a real tall order, I am afraid The One is a lock for reelection.</p>

		<p>Why are you so obsessed with Obama? He is hardly worse or better than his White rivals. We have to realise that both the Democrats and Republicans are useless for White people as whole parties. Instead force your local politicians irrespective of his political affiliation to vote on issues in our interest. Unless the U.S.A gets an American version of the BNP, which party gets the Senate and who becomes president should be pointless to us.</p>

		<p>Can you even believe it? We all know blacks vote hegemonically for their fellow blacks, but this is ridiculous! 98% of blacks support Obama, which is even more support than he received from blacks during the &#8220;historical election&#8221; last year. This literally means that the incidence of non-Obama supporting blacks is on par with the incidence of geniuses in the general population (2% of their respective populations). Throw a stone into a group of blacks and into a group of people generally, and the odds that you&rsquo;ll hit a black Republican in the first group and a genius in the other are literally even!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fret, though. The Republican National Committee (RNC) is surely justified and wise in its efforts to win over blacks and put a RINO, affirmative-action supporting black man (Michael Steele) at their head. Heck, they may win over 1,000 black voters, and all they have to do in the process is alienate millions of their white base. Such a profoundly mentally deficient strategy leaves one left with no other conclusion than this: the Republicans want to lose. Doesn&rsquo;t this seem like the most plausible explanation? Any fool, or child, can see that a group that has low voter turnout, votes 98% against you, and is only 13% of the population (blacks) should not be high on the priority list, to say the least. In fact, it&rsquo;s safe to say that as far as blacks go, it would actually be a better strategy for Republicans to be explicitly race realist, as the amount of blacks they could possibly alienate is already so close to zero - it would be more than offset by the support gained from racially conscious Americans.</p>

		<p>White people are mislead by the propaganda of the mass media. <br>
Because so many get their misinformation from the media,<br>
people with contrary opinions are seen as radicals and<br>
non conformist. This has worked so well since the 1960&rsquo;s.<br>
This is why internet sites light AMREN is so viable.<br>
There are far more informed people now than in  previous<br>
years. My feelings of those that call themselves moderates<br>
are actually liberal, and are afraid to call themselves<br>
liberals. This moderate turn was invented in the 1960&rsquo;s<br>
by the mass media because liberalism was unpopular, and<br>
make conservatives look like radicals. This is how public<br>
opinion was moved to the left to effect revolution in<br>
our society.</p>

		<p>My personal experience with many black folks is that the above writer was correct in thinking that blacks could care less about corruption or inefficiency in government as long as the goverment check keeps rolling in.</p>
<p>You are absolutely right, they basically state as much daily. The reason, as they often state, is due to the historical predicament that they see themselves in reagarding race relations, discrimination, slavery, ect no matter how real or imagined this might be.</p>
<p>They simple beleive that all whites, no matter what the connection with these supposed sins, are collectively guilty and therefoer they, being black, are collectively due  these jsut deserts. Like it or not, this is all proven within every single poll taken on these issues.</p>
