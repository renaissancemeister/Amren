<h1><a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/20091210/manhattan/police-shooting-times-square">Times Square Street Peddler Fatally Shot by Police</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A stolen-machine-gun-toting street peddler was killed during a shootout with an undercover NYPD sergeant near Times Square Thursday morning, police said.</p>
<p>The Midtown mayhem began shortly after 11 a.m., when the unidentified plainclothes officer spotted 25-year-old Raymond Martinez and his brother aggressively pestering tourists to buy CDs at Broadway and 45th Street.</p>
<p>When the officer asked to see their licenses, Martinez fled into a parking area beneath the Marriott Marquis Hotel, then spun around and fired two rounds at the officer with a MAC-10 machine gun before the weapon jammed, according to the NYPD.</p>
<p>The officer  &mdash;  a 17-year-veteran of the force who heads up a task force to stop illegal street peddling  &mdash;  returned fire, hitting Martinez twice, police said. Martinez was taken to St. Luke&rsquo;s Roosevelt Hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kelly added that the shooting appeared justified.</p>
<p>&#8220;The officer was prudent. There was no one else in the immediate area. He took a defensive position and fired,&#8221; Kelly added.</p>
<p>The foot-long compact machine gun was reported stolen in Richmond, Virginia two months ago, and police found a Virginia gun shop&rsquo;s business card in Martinez&rsquo;s pocket, Kelly said.</p>
<p>On the back of the card was a handwritten note referring to a 1985 film about a man obsessed with martial arts: &#8220;I just finished watching &#8216;The Last Dragon.&rsquo; I feel sorry for a cop if he think I&rsquo;m getting into his paddy wagon,&#8221; the note read.</p>
<p>Police said Martinez, who lived in the Bronx, was wanted for a prior assault. They did not provide details.</p>
<p>Kelly said Martinez was part of a group of scammers in Time Square that used pressure tactics to bully passerby into buying unwanted CDs. The men would approach tourists, ask their name, then sign their names onto a CD and demand payment, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a good person, he had a great heart,&#8221; a man identifying himself as Martinez&rsquo;s cousin said. &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martinez&rsquo;s friends said he was the leader of a rap group called &#8220;Square Free,&#8221; who posted videos on YouTube of himself and his friends rapping in Times Square and elsewhere.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Heather Grossmann and Josh Williams, DNAinfo, December 11, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Guns, drugs, prostitutes and an endless stream of expletives filled the rap lyrics  &mdash;  and the life  &mdash;  of Raymond Martinez, the Times Square gunman who shot off two rounds from his MAC 10 before an NYPD officer took him down late Thursday morning.</p>
<p>When he wasn&rsquo;t running CD scams on tourists in Times Square, the 25-year-old Bronx native  &mdash;  rap name &#8220;Ready&#8221;  &mdash;  was likely hanging with his buddies, drinking, smoking pot and laying down tracks, according to his friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll break your legs, have your brains looking like eggs,&#8221; Martinez raps in one song.</p>
<p>&#8220;Square Free&#8221; has a MySpace page with several images of their front man, Martinez. In a chilling harbinger of things to come, one image was digitally altered to make it look like Martinez was standing in the blood-spattered entryway of his apartment building with a machine gun lying at his feet.</p>
<p>Another picture shows him smoking what appears to be marijuana and a third is a cartoonish depiction of a man carrying a huge gun with a caption reading &#8220;THEM SUCKERS AINT TAKIN ME NO WHERE&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Videos on YouTube portray similar themes, showing Martinez and his crew running from cops and yelling &#8220;F**K the police,&#8221; and freestyle rapping about guns and women.</p>
<p>Martinez&rsquo;s friends say he was also a pimp, sometimes with as many as 10 prostitutes in his employ. According to one friend, he was particularly gifted at convincing women to go out and turn tricks for him.</p>
<p>But Martinez did appear to have some fun moments free of illegal influences. Pictures show him posing in Times Square with various celebrities including Grand Master Flash, rapper Ed Lover and activist Rev. Al Sharpton, and a newspaper clipping said he once went head-to-head with Kanye West in a hip hop trivia battle.</p>

		<p>Mr. Martinez was one of those &#8220;squeegy men&#8221; that Rudy Giuliani supposedly cracked down on.  But instead of washing your car windshield against your will, then wanting payment, he tried to compel people to buy the malodorous noise he calls &#8220;music.&#8221; </p>

<p>While Sharpton and West aren&rsquo;t technically illegal, they&rsquo;re not much better. </p>
<p>I find interesting that the media are downplaying that he wielded a machine gun, in anti-gun New York City.  We know the reason, but they would be emphasizing it if he were white and right wing.</p>

		<p>Just goes to show how stupid these punks are. He goes out and buys a MAC-10 machine gun thinking that will make him look tough and all it does is get him killed. Spent his time getting stoned and rapping instead of cleaning and oiling his weapon. </p>
<p>Anyway I hope someone buys that cop a few drinks and some cigars because that was some good work he did. It&rsquo;s very hard for a criminal to cry foul when he is shooting at the cops with a machine gun, even one that jams.  </p>

		<p>Not sure of this is true - but I read somewhere that this thug produced the weapon and proceded to draw down on the cops&hellip;in the sideways &#8220;gangsta&#8221; style stance, seen on no firing range, but popular in rap videos, films, television, etc. The gun apparently spat out an erratic shot or two, promptly jammed being so held on its side, and the thug was efficiently dispatched by the officiers, who held their firearms in the orthodox and sensible fashion they were designed to be used in.</p>
<p>Those zany &#8220;gangstas!&#8221;</p>

		<p> Where the heck did he get a machine gun? I &#8216;m sure NYC doesn&rsquo;t allow them, and I&rsquo;ll bet he didn&rsquo;t have a carry permit either.  What good are gun laws if people won&rsquo;t obey them? Get Schumer on the phone! He&rsquo;s busy abusing a flight attendant?  Okay default to Lautenberg.<br>
  FWIW, I&rsquo;m thankful to whoever is responsible for popularizing the &#8220;gangsta&#8221; gun turned on its side technique. If thugs are gonna shoot at me, I hope it&rsquo;s using that method, especially if the distance is over  5 feet. <br>
  No disputing the appropriateness of this particular NYPD use of force.  Assume room temperature, PimpThugRapper.</p>

		<p>It is a shame that blacks turn the urban environment into a combat zone where you constantly have to watch your back. Where I live, black men harass me for spare change so frequently that I now cut them off by yelling, &#8220;I&rsquo;m tapped out.&#8221; This preempts their attempt to strike up the meaningless conversation that always leads to a request for cash. I come across as &#8220;impolite&#8221;, but they immediately get my drift. Without blacks and Latinos most major cities would be nearly crime free.</p>
<p>Ask a white liberal, &#8220;which demographic commits the majority of violent crimes?&#8221; and they will act like they have no idea. Taking into account that literally millions of whites have been the victims of black crime since the 60s, it is hard to believe that they honestly don&rsquo;t know.</p>

		<p>Two good thing&rsquo;s to come out of what could have been a massacre are, this world has one less mutant in it and the real hero of this affair was a White Male. Sgt Newsom is an honest hero, as opposed to other incident&rsquo;s involving female&rsquo;s or non white&rsquo;s, which must be just killing the MSM. We probably have heard the last of him though as opposed to the so called hero of the Ft Hood massacre the female Sgt who just happened to be there as it turns out. The case of a few year&rsquo;s ago of Pvt Lynch in Iraq sounds very similar to Ft Hood, a female happens to be there and the press makes a hero of her.</p>

		<p>The reporter&rsquo;s description of the weapon used by Martinez is incorrect. <br>
First, the fully automatic Mac 10 is a SUBmachine gun (it uses pistol ammunition), not a machine gun (which uses rifle ammunition).<br>
Second,  it is almost certain that the version used was not fully automatic, but a semiautomatic, which means you have to pull the trigger each time to fire a bullet. As a result, the best description is that it was a semiautomatic pistol, and not a very reliable or accurate one at that.</p>

		<p>Urban Teachers analysis of the correct firearm terminology reminds me of the time I had to correct of all things&hellip;an urban teacher.. on the same subject. When I corrected her about a weapon described as a machine gun really being a sub machine gun she asked, &#8220;What`s the difference?!?&#8221; I replied &#8220;Life and death, at three hundred yards&hellip;&#8221; Thanks again guy! Reminds me of the time Rep. Carolyn Mc Carthy blathered on about flash suppressors, then a guy in the audience asked, &#8220;Do you know it it is? Do you even know what it does?!?&#8221; She didn`t have a clue and left the podium red faced and angry.</p>

		<p>  New York City is an empty shell because without Wall Street it is nothing. There is no industry or jobs for average people. It is only a matter of time before another minority charlatan (like Denkins) comes forward and is elected mayor. Then the old crime-ridden New York of the sixties will reemerge with a vengeance. Crime and urban decay will be the order of the day. The Kirk Russell movie Escape from New York will be turn out to be prophetic. </p>

		<p>HH (#4) is correct. The NY Post article described how the thug holding the gun sideways &#8220;gangsta style&#8221; caused a spent cartridge to &#8220;stovepipe&#8221; and jam it. Interesting that no other media outlet made mention of this fact.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; the peddler could not/would not produce a license. The peddler was harassing pedestrians to buy his junk. The peddler FIRED at police while fleeing&hellip; with a machine gun?</p>
<p>Firstly, NYC has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country. Machine guns are illegal not only under local and state, but also FEDERAL laws, unless you have the proper permit issued by the federal government!</p>
<p>So why the outcry over a dead criminal? One who arguably DESERVED to be shot for attempting to murder police officers. Who would probably have killed, had his weapon not jammed.</p>
