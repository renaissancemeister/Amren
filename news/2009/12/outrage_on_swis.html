			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Murphy, Christian Science Monitor, November 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Muslim reaction across the world to Sunday&rsquo;s Swiss referendum banning the construction of further minarets for mosques in the tiny Alpine nation has been almost entirely negative.</p>
<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s Maskuri Abdillah, leader of the largest Muslim organization in the world&rsquo;s most populous Muslim nation said the vote reflected Swiss &#8220;hatred&#8221; of Islam and Muslims.</p>
<p>Egyptian Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa, close to the regime of President Hosni Mubarak, said the ban was an attempt to &#8220;insult the feelings of the Muslim community in and outside Switzerland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the referendums outcome pales in comparison to restrictions on non-Muslims who aim to practice their faith in Muslim lands. In fact, the vote only brought Swiss legal practice closer to that of many majority Muslim states that also place limits on the construction of houses of worship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>1. Indonesia. In a state with large minority populations of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, and animists, the US State department reported in 2009 that at least 9 churches  &mdash;  and 12 mosques associated with the Ahmadiyya Islamic sect (which mainstream Muslim groups consider heretical)  &mdash;  were forced shut by violence or intimidation from community groups, and that a number of churches and Hindu temples have struggled to receive official permits in recent years. {snip}</p>
<p>2. Egypt. The country has a sizeable minority of Eastern Orthodox Christians, or Copts. By law, their churches must receive the permission of local Muslim communities before new construction is allowed. The State Department&rsquo;s religious freedom report on Egypt in 2009 says in part: &#8220;Church and human rights leaders {snip} charge that some local authorities refuse to process applications without &#8216;supporting documents&rsquo; that are virtually impossible to obtain.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. [In] Saudi Arabia, home of Mecca and Islam more generally, {snip} the public practice of any faith but Islam is illegal. Christian&rsquo;s and Jews receive 50 percent of the compensation that a Muslim would receive in personal injury court and the country has no churches at all, {snip}.</p>
<p>4. Pakistan. Freedom of religious worship is constitutionally guaranteed, but in practice the government sets limits and there has also been a rise in attacks by militant groups on both Christians and Shiites in the majority Sunni Muslim country in recent years. {snip} District level government &#8220;consistently refused to grant permission to construct non-Muslim places of worship, especially for Ahmadiyya and Baha&rsquo;i communities&#8221; {snip}.</p>

		<p>that a Muslim would receive in personal injury court and the country has no churches at all, {snip}.</p>
<p>Actually, there is a Catholic church (a small one) in Saudi and an equally small one in Kuwait (there could be others I am unaware of though) to accomodate the many Philippino Catholics that are virtually enslaved in those countries. I few years ago the Philippinos (via their govnmt I believe) asked for permission to build a new church and the request was denied with the Kuwait Emir and the Saudi king saying (in the Kuwait Times) that no more Christian churches will be built on muslim lands.</p>

		<p>Wow, a non-Leftist article from the Christian Science Monitor.  Will miracles never cease?</p>
<p>Aside from that, it&rsquo;s good to hear about the hypocracy of Muslim &#8220;outrage&#8221; over a non-Muslim country not wanting to be Islamified when most Muslim countries allow little or no religious freedom outside the politically favored sect of Islam.</p>

		<p>I agree with what the first poster said. Islamic architecture isn&rsquo;t the problem. Some would say the problem is Islam being in the West in the first place. Personally, I&rsquo;d say the problem is liberalism. Liberals scare me more than Muslims, because liberals enable Muslims to dispossess us with their fanatical support for multiculturalism and open borders with the Third World.</p>

You may be using &#8220;liberals&#8221; as a code word, but I have to agree with you that Muslims did not throw open (or FORCE open!) the gates to the West; those dratted &#8220;liberals&#8221; did it. Muslims didn&rsquo;t infiltrate their way in all by themselves, somebody LET them in.  There are traitors in our midst. </p>
<p>Without &#8220;enablement&#8221; as you put it, none of this would be happening.</p>

<p>In fact much of what we call &#8220;Islamic architecture&#8221; was borrowed from the Christian Byzantines, whom they conquered and overran.<br>

		<p>Anyone can look at history and the facts that Muslims reveal about themselves in their practice of Islam to find the truth about Islam. It is an intolerant ideology bent on world domination and the oppression of all non-Muslims. It is no more a religion than that practiced by Jim Jones and his deluded followers. It is a personality cult on a grand scale.</p>
<p>The great hoax of the age is thatIislam has succeeded in masquerading as a religion, and thus transformed itself from a conquering foe to an equal among equals. Freedom of Religion is a central tenet of all civilized societies and it is vigorously defended there. Islam is exploiting this. What they could not accomplish by the sword, they now accomplish by immigration and infiltration. Building mosques and minarets establishes their presence and confirms their right to be there. Even one is one too much. The Islamic nations know this and implement it one way or the other to prevent it.</p>
<p>Liberals should take a closer look at how Islam is practiced in places where it dominates. The Sudan would be a good place to start for an action packed opener. Then see &#8220;liberal&#8221; Saudi Arabia - a family owned business. A brief stop among the back water tribes of Tora Bora and neighborhood might be enlightening. Then there&rsquo;s the Taliban - we&rsquo;re not even close to Al Qaeda yet! There&rsquo;s still all of nuclear armed Pakistan, and, soon to be nuclear armed Iran! And more.</p>
<p>1.4 billion more.<br>

		<p>M (post # 9 above) has said what I was going to write and then some and has stated it well.  I remember from my college days (yes, I can still remember back that far) that Islam is a religion of conquest.  This garbage about a &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; is something that came about to fool the West into accepting them into the fold, so they can overtake us, kill us and thereby expand their territory.  When will the lefties understand this?  Perhaps they&rsquo;ll see the light after there is nothing at all left of Europe as we once knew it, nothing at all left of America as once we knew it.  It is scary.  If they can&rsquo;t be driven back to their homelands peacefully, then they must be driven back by force of arms.</p>
<p>Who are the fools who apologized for the Crusades some years back?  The Catholic Church and others never should have apologized for waging war against the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;.  We may have to wage war against Muslims with today&rsquo;s weapons which are far more fearsome than swords, spears and maces.  </p>

		<p>Of course the real problem is deeper.  This is really about an aggressive offensive group of people migrating into nonMuslim countries to overcome them using religion. The migrations of millions of people from other  countries introduces races and aggessive religious intentions to demolish the existing traditional cultures and  religions.  It is revealed by the legislations recently passed to favor certain groups (which denies equality). For over 200+ years US has kept the compact of orginal social harmony. Suddenly, everything needs to change to please foreign interests.  America must stand strong against invasions, evey when government no longer protects US as assigned.   V  </p>

		<p>It is well known that Saudi Arabian money is  funding these new mosques and minarets that are going up everywhere in non-Moslem countries. There is vey big money behind this campaign.  This is especially ironic, and hypocritical, considering that no Christian churches (or buildings of other religions), nor any kind of public services  outside of Islam, are allowed in Saudi Arabia.  None at all!  Such hypocrisy.</p>
