<h1>Debate Rages Over Surrey &#8216;Monster Homes&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate Allen, Globe and Mail (Toronto), December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For Kalvinder Bassi, the massive houses sprouting up throughout Surrey are part of his community&rsquo;s  &mdash;  and his own family&rsquo;s  &mdash;  way of living.</p>
<p>For Rick Hart, those same homes are an urban blight, and a sign of a &#8220;cultural divide&#8221; in the Vancouver suburb.</p>
<p>As the debate over monster homes rages, outsiders may be surprised to learn it began over a seemingly innocuous zoning bylaw amendment. For more than a year, Surrey city council has been mulling a change to municipal regulations that would expand home sizes on single-family lots to 4,550 square feet from 3,550, based on a petition from the Surrey Ratepayers Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Bassi, the association&rsquo;s vice-president, says big homes are a necessity for multi-generational families. A long-time resident and realtor, he lived in a Surrey mega-home as a young father.</p>
<p>&#8220;With three kids, my grandma and my parents, that was the only way we could live,&#8221; Mr. Bassi said. &#8220;You need the extra bathrooms because you have eight people. You can&rsquo;t have two bathrooms and a lineup every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mr. Hart, president of the Fleetwood Community Association, worries about what a spike in urban density will mean for communities. &#8220;We need to deal with the fact of common values and common vision for the city,&#8221; he said at a recent town hall meeting. When asked later, he said his reference to common values reflects a concern about large homes that are overbuilt, breaking the current bylaws.</p>
<p>Mr. Hart welcomes multigenerational families, but says, &#8220;if that is a legitimate requirement to deal with, then we need to take care of these other things,&#8221; such as infrastructure and school capacity.</p>
<p>Many citizens who oppose mega-homes believe they mar the character of Surrey neighbourhoods, where 1950s-built, ranch-style bungalows predominate. They say large homes consume green space, invite increased traffic, and bring heavy construction onto quiet residential roads.</p>
<p>Some of the community&rsquo;s ire also stems from illegal partitioning of mega-homes into multiple suites where as many as four rent-paying families live. Bob Bose, a city councillor, admits city hall has ignored bylaw infraction problems for decades. He estimates there may be as many as 30,000 extra suites in the city, representing $800,000 in unpaid taxes. Last month, two councillors admitted to owning illegal secondary suites.</p>
<p>Paul Fitzgerald, a local plumber and gas fitter, says he has witnessed alarming safety violations inside such homes. &#8220;The building code of Canada isn&rsquo;t a racist document, it&rsquo;s a safety document,&#8221; he said at the meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald, also a Surrey citizen, believes 3,500-square-foot homes are &#8220;unnecessary,&#8221; even if built legally. &#8220;They displace neighbours. I got friends, they walk out their side door and there&rsquo;s a 30 foot wall up, 50 feet long. And that&rsquo;s all they see now.&#8221; He says the homes are built right to the property line, so &#8220;there&rsquo;s no privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Simpson, CEO of the Greater Vancouver Home Builders&rsquo; Association, believes all houses must be built legally. But he sees much of the opposition coming from areas where there are no illegal residents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just to say we don&rsquo;t want these homes in our neighbourhood is a NIMBY reaction,&#8221; said Mr. Simpson, a resident of Surrey&rsquo;s Newton neighbourhood. He is an advocate of &#8220;housing affordability and choice, and both of those issues are addressed in these large homes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nathan Lauster, a professor of sociology at the University of British Columbia who studies immigration and housing, said that South Asian families in particular tend to have multiple generations living at home, children who only leave home in late adulthood, and a slightly higher birth rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trend is to find larger homes,&#8221; Dr. Lauster said. In Vancouver, &#8220;that tends to concentrate in Surrey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coquitlam, Richmond, Burnaby and Langley all permit homes within the range of the maximum sizes under consideration, according to documents presented before Surrey city council.</p>
<p>Mr. Bassi says &#8220;fear mongering&#8221; is at the heart of the opposition to large homes. &#8220;If it&rsquo;s in Shaughnessy, or Richmond, or Morgan Creek, [or] some of the posh neighbourhoods up in Fraser Heights, it&rsquo;s a mansion. But if it&rsquo;s here in Surrey, it&rsquo;s called a mega or a monster house.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I live in Canada, and first noticed this with a Pakistani family living in a normal suburban house. The unmarried daughter got into an affirmative action position with a government agency, and purchased a second house with a mortgage. </p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t move into the house, instead she lived at home and rented the house to others.  In the meantime, the parents illegally turned the basement of their house into a rental unit. </p>
<p>By using affirmative action and aggressively entering the rental property business, they now live off their properties, which is why they came here. </p>
<p>They never made any secret of their contempt for whites, but they are enjoying the country we built for them. </p>

		<p>A house on my street is owned by a man who has his own &#8220;lawn care&#8221; business.  There are anywhere from three to 12 vehicles parked on his property and down both sides of the street.  His employees live with him in the same house.  Their lady friends, and children, come to visit  &mdash;  often.</p>
<p>They claim to be from Guatemala.</p>

		<p>There was a story similar to this a couple of years ago regarding the massive, opulent houses that were being built in NW Washington, Dc, out into the Maryland suburbs. But these were mansions, meant to show off the owner&rsquo;s new wealth, apparently unlike those mentioned here. They were built to awe and impress with their size and lavishness, and with that explicit purpose very much in mind. It was in the Wash.Post or NYT. In both instances though, they are owned by &#8220;multi-generational&#8221; South Asian families.   [Translation:  Pakistani or Indian.]</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a &#8220;culturally sensitive housing&#8221; project that the University of Minnesota developed a few years ago. New housing that caters to the needs of ethnic minorities (primarily Somalis, it seems) would be built, presumably at taxpayers&rsquo; expense, to accommodate their special cultural and religious convictions.</p>
<p>The most obvious difference about this housing was that the front entrance ways would be partially hidden from view so that Somali women could come to the front door sans hijab without being seen. Inside, the housing would have special rooms with walls resembling urinals, where family members could wash their feet before saying their daily prayers. Kitchens would be closed off so that the women could cook sans hijab without assaulting the virtue of the local male population.</p>
<p>Of course, one has to wonder whether such housing might create a hostile environment for members of other ethnic groups who might want to purchase it later.</p>

		<p>Yes, we have forty years of corrupt federal politicians to thank for the mess that our children and grand children will have to live with (or die with).</p>
<p>Starting all with Pierre Elliot Trudeau.</p>
<p>The Canada we once knew and loved is now but a history.</p>
<p>Third world is going to be the new Canadian standard.</p>

		<p>The construction of monster houses began in the 1980&rsquo;s during what was termed &#8220;The Asian Invasion&#8221; as thousands of Hong Kong Chinese flooded into Vancouver before the Commies took control of their homeland.  They bought up everything in sight causing house prices to skyrocket, well out of the reach of any average white Canadian.   Bit by bit, the architectural history of Vancouver disappeared as lovely old homes were demolished to make way for monster homes equipped to house three or four families.   Now, they have become the norm in many parts of the Vancouver area and suburbs. Oh..and speaking of Political Correctness, just what is a &#8220;South Asian&#8221;?   Would that be anything like an East Indian?   If not,please explain just who are the North, West and East Asians?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a racist document yet.</p>
<p>Mr. Bassi says &ldquo;fear mongering&rdquo; is at the heart of the opposition to large homes. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s in Shaughnessy, or Richmond, or Morgan Creek, [or] some of the posh neighbourhoods up in Fraser Heights, it&rsquo;s a mansion.

<p>Sorry, but mansions aren&rsquo;t built to the property line.  They tend to have nice lawns and landscaping, as we all know.  And mansions don&rsquo;t tend to have four different families living in them.<br>
