<h1>Obama&rsquo;s Brother Made Image Ambassador in China</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, December 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The half-brother of US President Barack Obama has been made an &#8220;image ambassador&#8221; for southern China&rsquo;s booming city of Shenzhen, state press reported Sunday.</p>
<p>Mark Obama Ndesandjo was named image ambassador on Friday by the Shenzhen Youth League for his volunteer work teaching piano to orphans in the city, where he lives, the Beijing News reported.</p>
<p>Since moving to Shenzhen in 2002, Ndesandjo has given lessons once a week to orphans at the Shenzhen Social Welfare Centre, the paper said.</p>
<p>The son of President Obama&rsquo;s late father and his third wife Ruth Nidesand, Ndesandjo reportedly runs a business consultancy in China.</p>
<p>During Obama&rsquo;s visit to China last month, the two had a brief, but emotional reunion in Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a big hug. And my wife and he had a big, big hug. He was very powerful, very intense, because he&rsquo;s my big brother,&#8221; Ndesandjo said in an interview at the time with CNN.</p>
<p>The two half-brothers did not know each other while growing up, but have met from time to time as adults, and always manage to re-forge their bond, Ndesandjo said.</p>
<p>Ndesandjo revealed in a semi-autobiographical book that he was often physically abused by his father, Barack Obama Sr  &mdash;  a revelation President Obama said was not entirely surprising.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&rsquo;t read the book. But it&rsquo;s no secret that my father was a troubled person,&#8221; Obama told CNN.</p>

As relationships in these intricate African polygamous families can get complicated, and it isn&rsquo;t explained in the article,  I had to look up just what and who these people were. This Mark was the son of Obama senior&rsquo;s NEXT white wife from the US (who divorced him for abuse, then married another African).  According to Wikipedia   &mdash;  </p>
<p><b><i>Ruth Ndesandjo: </i></b><br>
Born Ruth Nidesand, in US c. 1940s, Barack Obama Sr.&rsquo;s third wife and a private kindergarten director in Kenya.  Ruth&rsquo;s two sons with Barack Obama, Sr., are Mark and David Ndesandjo; her third son, Joseph Ndesandjo, was born c. 1980 from a subsequent marriage to a Tanzanian.</p>
<p><b><i>Mark Okoth Obama Ndesandjo:</i></b><br>
Barack Obama&rsquo;s half-brother, son of Ruth Nidesand and Barack Obama Sr.  He runs an Internet company called WorldNexus that advises Chinese corporations how best to reach international customers.  Mark graduated from Brown University, studied physics at Stanford University, received an MBA from Emory University, and has lived in Shenzhen, China since 2002.   He is Jewish  and is married to Liu Xuehua (also spelled Liu Zue Hua in some reports), a Chinese woman from Henan Province.   In November 2009, he held a press conference for the upcoming publication of his semi-autobiographical novel Nairobi to Shenzhen, and stated that he also planned to write a proper autobiography which would go into more detail about his relationship with Barack Obama.    <a href="https://tinyurl.com/czdhkz" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/czdhkz</a></p>

<p>   This is the greatest understatement of the century. President Obama&rsquo;s romantic idolization of his father is not shared by his half brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo.</p>

		<p>In typical black fashion, all of the Obamaster&rsquo;s relatives will have to have a government job found or MADE for them.</p>

		<p>WOW - did the Obamapress manage to keep this one secret or what?  This is the first I&rsquo;ve heard of it.  Well, China probably wanted to capitalize on the Obama name.  But the Pres. is not exactly forthcoming about his family OR his origins, as we well know.  They probably kept this dark (so to speak) simply to keep speculations about the Obama family to a minimum.</p>

		<p>Interesting that Obama has a brother who is Jewish.  I wonder how that came about?  Probably through his mother, I would assume. Thus, the Obama family encompasses Christians, Jews, Moslems, and Buddhists. </p>
