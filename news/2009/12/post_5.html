<h1>Fliers on BSU Campus Called Racist</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nishi Gupta, KTVB-TV (Boise), December 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students at Boise State University are calling some fliers offensive and racist.</p>
<p>The literature first surfaced last week on World AIDS Day. It tells people how not to catch AIDS by suggesting no sex with bisexuals or people who inject drugs.  But the language that has students most concerned is about African Americans.</p>
<p>Senior Jalara Walker, an African-American, came to BSU from California.  She&rsquo;s loved her time on campus, but that changed last week after she found several fliers in a class.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really thought that stuff like this was over,&#8221; Walker said.</p>
<p>The fliers read: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Catch AIDS!&#8221; at the top.  At the bottom they say: &#8220;Blacks are walking STD factories&#8221; and &#8220;once u go black we don&rsquo;t want u back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walker said she laughed at first, thinking it absurd, but then left class to report it to the dean&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just makes me uncomfortably aware that I shouldn&rsquo;t be here. That&rsquo;s what I feel like. I don&rsquo;t want to go back to school,&#8221; Walker said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dwight Murphy saw a woman last week stuffing newspapers at a campus newsstand with those fliers.</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&rsquo;t look anymore out of place than any student here,&#8221; Murphy said.</p>
<p>As the advertising manager for &#8220;The Arbiter&#8221;, the student paper, Murphy told her she could not do that.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know what her handouts said, but as soon as he found out he called police.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would personally love it if they could figure out who did it and catch them,&#8221; Wakeley said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to sit in a classroom and think that people don&rsquo;t want me to be there or people think any less of me because I&rsquo;m black,&#8221; Walker said.</p>
<p>The president of the Black Student Alliance says the flier is insulting to the entire campus, not just black students.  Out of BSU&rsquo;s nearly 19,000 students, 361 are black.<br>

								<h2>BSU Students Rally Against Hate After Racist Fliers Surface on Campus</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Edgar Linares, KTVB-TV (Boise), December 11, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Boise State students are holding a solidarity rally today to help stop hate on campus.</p>
<p>The rally was organized after racist fliers circulated on campus earlier this week.</p>
<p>Students are calling today&rsquo;s event &#8220;Hands Across Campus.&#8221;  They will join hand in hand and see how far they can stretch across campus.  They are expected to hold hands for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Also, protesters are asked to sign a statement against hate on campus and a special event will be held at a later date.</p>
<p>This is in reaction to the flier that surfaced on the BSU campus and targeted black students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A BSU spokesman said police and the school administration are investigating the fliers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students want to make a statement to show the students stand unified against this type of hate message.<br>

		<p>The second article indicates to me that the fliers are a hoax, even if they&rsquo;re mostly true.  If they weren&rsquo;t true, then you wouldn&rsquo;t have black organizations asking the Yankee government for money based on the &#8220;crisis&#8221; of blacks contracting and spreading AIDS at the highest rate among American racial groups.</p>

		<p>It IS racist to say that blacks are walking STD factories.  But, it is also true that blacks carry the highest rate of infection of STDs, including HIV.  Perhaps there could be an article written about avoiding STDs, in which the statistics for infection of the various racial groups could be published.  If everybody&rsquo;s stats were out there, nobody could complain.</p>

		<p>The fliers might be a hoax, but I am pretty sure they are not. There is a group in Idaho that will pass out fliers like this and it was probably &#8220;them&#8221;. But having said that the fliers are factually true.</p>

<p>Bisexual men are one of the leading sources of infection for women. And the AIDs rate among IV drug users is well known.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Blacks are walking STD factories&rdquo; and &ldquo;once u go black we don&rsquo;t want u back.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Blacks age 13 to 24 account for 63 percent of all new AIDS cases. Heterosexual Black males are 14 times as likely as Whites to be HIV carriers. In addition, a recent survey has shown that HIV-positive Blacks are less likely to tell sexual partners of their infection than any other racial group.</p>

		<p>Oh, so these fliers are &#8220;racist,&#8221; huh? Well, let&rsquo;s check the statistics:</p>
<p>- Nearly 60% of blacks over age 40 have type-2 genital herpes (recurrent genital blisters) (1).<br>
- Blacks account for half of the people who contract HIV/AIDS, despite comprising merely 13% of the American population (2).<br>
- Blacks account for 50% of all gonorrhea cases in Minnesota (3).</p>
<p>Using credible sources, I just proved that blacks <i>are</i> disproportionately affected by STDs. The flier used a very blunt way of saying it, but it&rsquo;s indeed correct.</p>

<p>Just imagine how upset she would be if the entire truth about blacks was on about ten thousand different tee shirts?  I imagine she would go ballistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important to understand that we are dealing with children here, so we not only have to allow Walker to enter college even though she&rsquo;s not qualified, we must also give her passing grades even though she can&rsquo;t do the course work.</p>
<p>Then, on top of it all, we must never mention all the pathologies within the black population, and, above all, we MUST pretend that she and all her black AA cohorts are qualified.</p>
<p>In other words, to keep them from rioting and burning down their own neighborhoods we must treat them like children who are too incompetent to care for themselves.</p>

		<p>A valuable sidebar to the original article would have been a chart with official CDC statistics on STDs broken down by race. I have no doubt such a sidebar would have been included if the statistics showed blacks did not have astronomically higher STD rates. Unfortunately for the &#8216;anti-hate&rsquo; crowd, they do.</p>

<p>You SHOULD be aware that you shouldn&rsquo;t be there! You SHOULD feel like that! Don&rsquo;t go back to school! There&rsquo;s plenty of black colleges out there, but you chose to go to lily-White Idaho! If you&rsquo;re so offended,&#8221;Jalara&#8221;, go to a school back in the hood, I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t be missed and it will make the average test scores for that school to go up. And plese take acouple of those candle holding White &#8220;progressive&#8221; liberals with you so they can experience &#8220;diversity&#8221; up close and personal - they won&rsquo;t be missed either.  </p>

		<p>To oldwhitebroad:</p>
<p>How can you say &#8220;to say that blacks are walking STDs is racist&#8221;, on the one hand, and yet admit that blacks have the highest rates of STDs, including HIV, on the other?</p>
<p>Are you saying that telling the truth is somehow racist?</p>
<p>Blacks will foam at the mouth in cases like this, where someone has the cajones to tell the truth, even if it&rsquo;s printed on t-shirts. And yet, they&rsquo;ll go to Uncle Sam, hat in hand, asking for MORE MONEY for AIDS research (my emphasis), because Bantus are &#8220;disproportionately affected by AIDS/HIV&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s OK to say blacks have the highest AIDS/HIV infection rates, if it&rsquo;s a black speaking those words, and money is involved. If whitey says it, then it&rsquo;s &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>That dog don&rsquo;t hunt anymore. If blacks are uncomfortable with other people speaking the truth about them, then so be it!</p>

		<p>In these debates it would be helpful if data were given showing how many blacks have &#8220;at least&#8221; one STD. We often see data showing blacks have x% of one STD and y% of another but we need to know the overlap of blacks who have several STDs and how many have just one. Compare for whites, give the odds for infection, and then report the data to the student body so that informed risk-based choices can be made. </p>

<p>Well, bye bye then. Don&rsquo;t let the door hit you on the way out.</p>
<p>I work at a state university.  Black students with their baggy pants-clown outfits are noticeable on campus for the first 2 weeks of each semester, then they fade into the mist as the term progresses.  Closer to finals week, the clown outfits are all but gone.  Natural selection I suppose.  But flyers stating the truth wouldn&rsquo;t hurt either.</p>

		<p>I actually live in Boise where this story broke. I&rsquo;m not sure how to feel about what&rsquo;s happened. White women with black men is a big problem here, I would say that 9 out of 10 black guys have a white girlfriend, it makes me sick. </p>
<p>I was about to ask this white girl out on campus, when her black boyfriend walks up and in ebonics was like &#8220;who dat?&#8221; Ironically this same girl complained about being mistreated by &#8220;guys.&#8221; </p>
<p>The flier about black STD&rsquo;s at first seemed like a good thing until I saw a lot of white girls clamoring on the news for a chance to protect the black man. Yet again I felt disgusted about how it was going down. </p>
<p>On the flip side they did cover exactly what the flied said on the news, which might make people think if there&rsquo;s truth to it. Anyways, it used to be a nice white place here in Boise, now it&rsquo;s getting really bad. Is there anywhere we can be free?</p>

		<p>If the flyers were intended to be taken seriously, they should have presented the cold hard facts without the inflammatory language. True or not, referring to blacks as &#8220;STD factories&#8221; makes it appear the flyers were primarily motivated by racial animus, thus undermining the information the flyers were ostensibly intended to transmit.  The flyers&rsquo; distributers did the race-irrealists a service by making solid STD research look like propoganda.  </p>

		<p>In 2008 the CDC announced that there was a genetic component to HIV that made blacks seven to ten times more susceptible to the disease than whites. It was not just promiscuity, release of prisoners, homosexuality, or drug use among the blacks. It was just not a behavioral problem. I knew that almost twenty-five years ago. Read &#8220;The Nazi Virus&#8221; it tells the story. <br>
That said, it does not explain the high incidence of the other STDs. If white students held hands and lit candles because of the truth, well they were just worrying about their football.</p>

		<p>These fliers are the tripe that makes any sort of respectable race realism so difficult. In a sense, they are correct: blacks, intravenous drug users and probably bisexuals are disproportionally represented in those with sexual diseases. But the logic that this fact is used in is idiotic: that it is a reasonable method of avoiding disease simply to avoid sexual relations with anybody belonging to a group contributing more individuals to the total diseased than other groups do. There are blacks, bisexuals and probably even intravenous drug users who are disease-free and safety concious, and there are heterosexual whites and asians who are not. I suppose if you had no means of telling who was a disease risk you could make some feeble effort to avoid disease by just group stats, but fortunately, you can tell, by using the tests that exist and are readily available, and by assessing character   &mdash;   which, although not foolproof, is still very effective overall   &mdash;   at least if you are reasonably intelligent   &mdash;   and is I think the only thing approaching a guarantee.</p>

		<p>Blacks are very quick to acknowledge that they have much higher STD rates than other groups - but only when such facts are worded in such a way that blacks are referred to as victims.  For example, it&rsquo;s okay to say that &#8220;blacks SUFFER from STD&rsquo;s more than other groups&#8221; but it&rsquo;s not okay to say &#8220;it&rsquo;s more risky to have sex with blacks than with members of other groups&#8221; even though both statements are saying the same thing.  Hence we find black oriented sites, magazines and organizations bemoaning the high rates of STD&rsquo;s among blacks but anybody who bemoans the high rates of INFECTION BY BLACKS is considered a racist.  Parents, protect your daughters!  Protect them with correct attitudes and knowledge.</p>

		<p>This thing smells like a trout left out of the freezer for a week.No self repecting bigot would write such tripe. Most really good hate literature is usually in perfect grammar. It was written by some liberal out of state agitator who thinks white folks who value the old Idaho are ignorant yahoos. Of course one of the few blacks on campus just had to stumble over  the inartfully drawn piece of truth.Idaho is about the last bastion of sanity and freedom in America. It is a better place after it got rid of it`s bathroom ranger senator.<br>

<p>When you have television channels like MTV, deifying blacks, it is very difficult to present reality by numbers, to a young man or lady. </p>
<p>In some cases, with youth especially, frank vernacular is truly effective in snapping them out of their trance-like state.  </p>

Some of them will be scrambling to be standing next to a Black male during this Hands Across Campus business.  Party time for the Brothers, and the Sisters will be flaming with jealousy.  <br>
     Maybe this really is an &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; stunt.  If so, I Do hope the cops catch the perp.  It&rsquo;s protected speech anyway, but at least some of the silly White children will recognized they&rsquo;ve been had.</p>

		<p>This post is a little off topic, forgive me. At the blood bank, there is always a poster of people who are ineligible to give blood. On the list is men who have had sex with other men after 1975. Naturally, this is because of the prevelence of HIV among homosexual men. However, even though black men have replaced homosexual men as the #1 carrier of HIV, there is no warning about giving blood being a black man or after having sex with a black man. The last time I went to give blood, I asked the lady who was in charge of the paperwork why you could not give blood when you had had sex with another man, being perfectly aware of the answer. When she told me, I asked her if that was the group that really was the top carrier of HIV. She had no answer, which means she actually knew. After that experience, I will think twice about ever accepting a blood transfusion, and not for religious reasons. </p>

		<p>Colleges campuses are ideal environments for perpetrating racial hoaxes.</p>
<p>See &#8220;Colleges Perfect Milieu for Hate Crime Hoaxes,&#8221; Associated Press, April 20, 2004, San Diego Times-Union: <br>
https://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20040420-0247-ca-hatecrimehoaxes.htm</p>
<p>A well-executed hoax in the hyper-politically correct atmosphere at an institution of &#8220;higher learning&#8221; is guaranteed a big payoff   &mdash;  - media attention, victim status for one group, sympathy for one group, demonization of another.  </p>
<p>Bottom line: Find the creator of the fliers. Then you know what to make of the incident.</p>

		<p>The fliers may be a hoax and the implication that ALL blacks are &#8220;STD factories&#8221; is clearly a provocative over-generalization. Still, the basic message that blacks are far more likely to have STDs and that it is therefore (among other reasons) a good idea for white women to avoid sexual relationships with black men is certainly true. </p>
<p>White racialists should in fact distribute fliers like this, but without provocative over-generalizations and with exact statistics on the issue and with lots of links to the official statistical sources such as this link<br>

		<p>Anonymous wrote: &#8220;But the logic that this fact is used in is idiotic: that it is a reasonable method of avoiding disease simply to avoid sexual relations with anybody belonging to a group contributing more individuals to the total diseased than other groups do.&#8221;</p>
<p>If airline A is 20 times more likely to lose my luggage and eight time more to suffer a plane crash than airline B, then it is entirely logical to avoid flying on airline A. </p>
<p>&#8220;There are blacks, bisexuals and probably even intravenous drug users who are disease-free and safety concious [sic], and there are heterosexual whites and asians who are not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody here is claiming the contrary. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;and by assessing character,&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you see how the incidence of STDs among a population reflects a certain morality (or lack thereof)?  Blacks are far more likely than whites and Asians to have numerous sex partners, to have sex out of marriage, to cheat on their spouses and lovers, to have children out of wedlock, to not support said children born out of wedlock, to contract STDs, and to knowingly pass on STDs to their spouses and lovers. </p>
<p>Do you not see the connection here?  While no race a monopoly on virtue, blacks are far more likely to lead sexually immoral lives. They tend to have what economists call &#8220;high time preferences,&#8221; i.e., they live for today, and don&rsquo;t delay gratification in exchange for long-term real happiness. </p>
<p>There are real differences between blacks and whites.  Time and again the facts and statistics show this, and intelligent non-brainwashed people can draw perfectly reasonable inferences from the data.  </p>

<p>Well, actually, I think it is only the beginning. I think it is part of a whole movement in the US, where White people have begun to stand up for themselves, after years and years of affirmative action, reverse racism, violence towards Whites, and more recently, the election of a Black president who is pretty much failing to deliver on all of his electoral promises.</p>
<p>We have seen Tea parties and the like, but there also seems to be something going on university campuses. Which is a good thing, I think.</p>
<p>Some will argue that what is written in these flyers is racist, and that they shouldn&rsquo;t be distributed on campuses. But then, on those same campuses, you have reverse-racist Black tenured professors like Leonard Jefferies and his clones, who spout anti-White propaganda. So I say, white people aren&rsquo;t going to take it anymore. </p>

		<p>The flier is a joke, right? I mean seriously. It is TRUE, that Blacks are far more likely to carry STDs. It also is TRUE that stating such realities in public is racist, despite the veracity of such claims. So, like those nooses (noosi?) we keep hearing about&hellip; hate crimes that invariably ended up as nooses HUNG BY BLACKS to elicit sympathy or cause strife&hellip; why should we automatically believe that flier was the work of evil racists?</p>

		<p>Ironically, the fliers are probably both a hoax and quite truthful.  Blacks tend to be more promiscuous that whites, and, therefore,  more likely to get and have STDs. </p>
<p>Black males are 8 times more likely to have HIV/AIDs than white males.  Black females are 20 times more likely than white females.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avert.org/usa-race-age.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.avert.org/usa-race-age.htm</a></p>

<p>The truth is, Ms. Walker, that most students don&rsquo;t want you there. </p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be around your own people, where you feel most comfortable and at home.</p>
<p>If there is a silver lining to losing majority status, perhaps it will be that white people will form their own white Universities, like how blacks have had their own schools for years and years. </p>
