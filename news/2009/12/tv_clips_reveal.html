			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Hall, Toronto Star, December 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Researchers at Tufts University say negative body language between black and white characters in TV dramas studied, such as House, above, was clear in recent experiments.</p>
<p>Racist body language comes through loud and clear on television, even when the sound is off, a new study shows.</p>
<p>Through a set of ingeniously concocted experiments, reported Friday in the journal Science, researchers show that white characters in television series display far more negative body language toward their black peers than to members of their own race.</p>
<p>The bias conveyed by these body clues is not only recognized subconsciously by people who watch the shows, but significantly influences their feelings about the black characters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadly, we observed that non-verbal race bias is a typical pattern on scripted television shows,&#8221; lead study author Max Weisbuch said in a release on the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;White characters are treated better across the board and this has an impact on viewers,&#8221; said Weisbuch, a post-doctoral psychologist at Massachusetts&rsquo;s Tufts University.</p>
<p>In the first experiment, researchers used clips from 11 television programs  &mdash;  including Bones, Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy, CSI and Scrubs  &mdash;  and digitally removed one of the characters participating in the scenes.</p>
<p>They then muted any onscreen conversations and recruited college students who had never seen the episodes to watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We took out the target character, who was either black or white, and the (remaining) character was always white,&#8221; senior study author Nalini Ambady said in an interview with the Star.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we just showed people and said &#8216;how much does this person like the person they&rsquo;re interacting with?&rsquo;&#8221; said Ambady, a Tufts social psychologist.</p>
<p>The viewers, it was found, consistently judged the body language expressed by the visible white characters as more negative whenever the unseen character in the scene was black.</p>
<p>Ambady stresses that the black characters in the scenes selected were not criminals or impoverished, as often seen on television.</p>
<p>Instead, the scenes came from enlightened series that portray blacks as social and intellectual peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a medical drama for example, both the black and the white characters were doctors,&#8221; Ambady said. Yet while the negative body language is certainly not scripted, she was not sure if it reflects innate reactions by the white actors, is directorial in origin, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no bias in what they&rsquo;re saying, the bias seems to be in the way they are conveying, and we have no idea where that&rsquo;s coming from,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Ambady says positive body language like smiling, nodding and leaning forward while talking is far less common when white characters engage with black co-stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;The black characters receive significantly less positive non-verbal behaviour. They&rsquo;re liked less non-verbally than white characters.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a separate test, Ambady&rsquo;s team looked at how the onscreen biases might affect regular viewers.</p>
<p>This involved a new group of students chosen for being frequent watchers of the programs in question.</p>
<p>These students were given a set of standard psychological tests that measure subconscious biases.</p>
<p>Researchers found that this subconscious bias grew in direct proportion to the number of episodes each student had seen.</p>
<p>Thus, Ambady says, the subtle body-language bias displayed on television can create &#8220;insidious&#8221; repercussions in subconscious racial feelings among millions of viewers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, when someone says something to you that&rsquo;s biased, you can correct for it, you can say &#8216;that guy&rsquo;s a jerk,&rsquo;&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when something is conveyed indirectly, where you&rsquo;re not conscious of it, then it&rsquo;s more difficult for you to control it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a journal commentary on the study, Yale University psychologist John Dovidio said the paper&rsquo;s use of white college students as viewers showed just how potent the non-verbal cues were in creating bias.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus, non-verbal messages influence relatively sophisticated participants who are especially motivated to appear unbiased,&#8221; he says.<br>

		<p>Why are we to believe that the body language isn&rsquo;t also scripted?  And if the test subjects are so impossibly racist that they react the way they do, then why doesn&rsquo;t Tufts and other universities give up the crusade against racism?</p>

		<p>The point is that everything Whites do is racist, even if they don&rsquo;t think so. They will use  that as an excuse to take away even more of our rights.</p>

		<p>&#8220;recognized subconciously by people who watch the shows&#8221;<br>
 I am one of those people. I have watched sooo much television, that I can recieve the subliminal messages, allegories and cues wide awake. I  discovered this  by accident when I  saw a psycologist discuss this very thing  using three movies as an example. I remember only one because it was one I was familiar with. The movie was called, &#8220;Can`t Buy Me Love&#8221;. It`s the one where Patrick Dempsey plays the geek who bribes a cheerleader to be his girlfriend. <br>
  In the movie after he is discovered and shunned by the entire student body, he speaks the truth about cliques, then stumbles  and hunches over a low wall to eat his lunch alone. And I said, he looks just like one of those medevil jesters who tells the king the real deal. The psycologist mentioned this  very scene and I went &#8220;Damn, I`m one of those people. I saw it in my mind&#8221;!!<br>
 So now I tell people that the Confederate Flag is not a symbol of racism, it is merely Hollywood cinematic shorthand for racism! The very people who claim it is racist are the ones who made it so! When they poo-pooh the idea I ask them, &#8220;When you see an old movie with the calendar pages blowing away, what do you think? That it`s windy outside, or that time is passing&#8221;?&hellip;And thats how it works folks!<br>

		<p>Why blame white racism for this?</p>
<p>In human interaction, body language tends to be symmetric.<br>
A&rsquo;s movements towards B mirror B&rsquo;s movements towards A.</p>
<p>One should try the reverse experiment and see if there&rsquo;s bias in black characters talking to whites (rather than other blacks), racial bias being innate and universal.<br>

While it&rsquo;s tempting (and easy) to ridicule this research, I suspect there is a gain of truth.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that when I meet a stranger my body language is different from when I greet an old friend.</p>
<p>Likewise, when I&rsquo;m around someone of a different race, I bet my body language registers distance and apprehension. If it&rsquo;s a black male and a stranger, I bet my stance registers sideways as if I&rsquo;m prepared to bolt.</p>
<p>I suspect our body language is an instinct and responds to racial cues.</p>
<p>While this research may not be perfect, it&rsquo;s not necessarily something bad. In fact, it works as yet another argument that the races are different and our minds process our reaction to these differences differently.</p>

		<p>I came across research related to the &#8216;Authoritarian Personality&rsquo; on the internet a month or so ago. I remembered the work from college or even earlier. I clicked on it to read/be reminded some more. What the &#8216;researcher&rsquo; had done, was simply list the beliefs/ideologies of liberals and conservatives and place them on opposite sides of a paper, and then label those on the conservative side as attributes of the &#8216;Authoritarian Personality&rsquo;. It was comic book stuff. &#8216;Liberals&rsquo; (the establishment), nowadays are way more sophisticated. Do we owe this to competition for coveted spots at the top of the liberal heap? Even do to their fear of diversity? Jared Taylor chided students at the end of one speech by saying the very reason they were at college was to try and escape diversity. </p>

		<p>The descent into absolute madness regarding all things racial is evidently almost complete! Now, we are to believe the &#8220;body-language&#8221; of scripted television actors, virtually ALL of whom are bleeding-heart liberals to the core, is dripping with &#8220;racism?!?&#8221; What&rsquo;s next, the SMELL of racism? Will all aracial &#8220;right-thinking&#8221; types soon announce an ability to detect racism merely by scent? </p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. White, you are going to have to report to diversity and sensitivity training, as you reek of racism!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, what have I said or done that makes you say that, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, perhaps I wasn&rsquo;t clear - you literally STINK of bigotry&hellip;we can smell it all over you like bad cologne.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Um&hellip;okay&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, my white brothers and sisters - all this really IS madness!</p>

		<p>As Italian pointed out in post #4, this was a very unscientific study. I would love to see the results if the races were reversed. I&rsquo;d also love to see the results for both races if the study used photos of people in real life. </p>

		<p>With affirmative action, who knows what black who has a college degree is qualified for the job they hold.   It seems that pushing them through college and forcing companies hire them, has bitten them in the backside.   When I see one in a profession, that is the first thing I think and I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want them working on me or anyone I cared about.  I know of a nurse who caused a great deal of trouble because she didn&rsquo;t want to perform her job and I didn&rsquo;t know if it was sheer laziness, or if it was because she really didn&rsquo;t know what she was doing.  She thought she couldn&rsquo;t get fired because of her skin color and used the race card at every turn.  It took alot of wrangling but she has been gone a couple years now, but the unit she was in has never recovered its morale.  Why would anyone want to be around these people?   I have also heard of college educated blacks referred to as &#8220;bluegums&#8221;.  Does anyone know the origin of this? </p>

		<p>They could put these researchers into a black neighborhood and study their own body language. There&rsquo;s the wrist flick needed to set the dead bolt lock on the door. There&rsquo;s the straight ahead gaze as one walks through the mall pretending not to notice thugs. There&rsquo;s the fast walk as one rushes to get home before dusk. There&rsquo;s the cower as one tries to shrink into a corner of the elevator. There&rsquo;s the big toothy smile as one greets the homies hanging out in the apartment lobby.  </p>

		<p>The corporate entertainment culture and the dominant media culture are sub-sets of the campaign of defamation that the diverse white American peoples get hit with coming and going.</p>
<p>1) Some dramatized characters are intended to hold white Americans up to scorn (e.g., Archie Bunker).</p>
<p>2) Some dramatized characters are intended to hold Others up as inherently better than white Americans.</p>
<p>3) Some dramatic interactions are intended to model the proper way for us to behave, to stand, and to speak.  A real life example, not entertainment, was the Amy Biehl story which featured her self-sacrifice to thugs in South Africa plus her parents&rsquo; loving forgiveness of the thugs.  This is how we are told to behave when we suffer losses.</p>
<p>As additional evidence of this modeling function in entertainment and media, consider how seldom you have heard a parent quoted when they express bitterness over the harm done to a child.  That&rsquo;s just silenced.</p>

		<p>Italian #4 has a good point.  What is the attitude of the Black actors toward the Whites?  Of course, it might be that, despite the fact that all these people are professionals at make believe, this business of brilliant Black doctors is too much for even them to swallow.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Researchers found that this subconscious bias grew in direct proportion to the number of episodes each student had seen.<br>
What he is trying to sell is the P C idea that the more you watch the shows the more racist you will become.  </p>
<p>But this is totally wrong.  No one grew more racists.  There was no growing on the part of viewers, as if Bill watched 100 shows and then was tested and found now to be 20 times more biased, and Betty watched only 50 shows and now she is only fives times as biased.  The growing was done on the correlation chart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, Ambady says, the subtle body-language bias displayed on television can create &lsquo;insidious&rsquo; repercussions in subconscious racial feelings among millions of viewers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As usual the liberals have it backwards.  Little babies don&rsquo;t grow up smarter because in the crib they listened to Mozart instead of Hip Hop.  They are smarter to begin with and incidentally their smarter parents played Mozart instead of Hip Hop.  </p>
<p>The people who watched the show more, like the show more specifically because of the racial feelings subtlety communicate.  Shows where the actors explicitly override their natural racial bias are not pleasant to watch so the racially biased group (normal white people) watches the more agreeable racially realistic shows.</p>
<p><br>
It seems as though every study done about white people not wanting to be around minorities, what is known as racism, shows that racism begins shortly after conception and continues unabated until shortly after being buried in an all white cemetery.<br>

<p>If they reversed the study (which we all know they won&rsquo;t do - have they ever?) and the black faces on TV were looking with apprehension at their white counterparts, this would be shown as proof the whites in the picture (or not pictured) were oppressing them and secretly taking advantage of them, and this was the poor thing&rsquo;s reaction. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s another angle to this.  While I&rsquo;m a &#8220;House&#8221; junkie, and have been since the pilot episode, I know that you can accomplish a lot of things in fiction.  For example, you can go from a life of stealing cars at the age of 16, to getting into Hopkins Med at 22, to being a neurologist and a resident on the world&rsquo;s greatest diagnostician at 27.  All while being a member of America&rsquo;s favorite minority group.  However, the fiction of the fictional diagnostician never having a native born white American man as a resident/fellow on his team (&#8220;Chase,&#8221; Jesse Spencer, is and pretends to be Australian, at least), is unfortunately very close to reality.  </p>
<p>As far as &#8220;Bones,&#8221; the &#8220;Jeffersonian&#8221; (read: Smithsonian) has been headed by a black man and then a black woman.  The black man said that he doesn&rsquo;t talk to anyone without a Ph.D.  I thought to myself that he must have the world&rsquo;s most charmed life, not having to deal with any other blacks.</p>

		<p>While I question the vailidty of the study, and note racist bias in the fact that it was one-sided studiying white reactions to the proximity of blacks and not blacks reaction to the proximity of whites.  However lets assume it is true, that groups tend to prefer their own across all races.  Both consciously and unconsciously.  Then what?</p>

		<p> If we can put a man on the moon, how come we can&rsquo;t keep over-educated morons from conceiving and conducting numbskulled experiments like this one?</p>
<p> Why did they choose college students to take the experiment? Because they are pre-disposed to suffer from White guilt, and to look for (mostly imagined) slights to &#8220;People of Color.&#8221;</p>
<p> In short, these &#8220;researchers&#8221; found what they wanted to find. It was one of those, &#8220;Ah HA! Just as we suspected!&#8221; studies. Aren&rsquo;t there enough real problems demanding their attention to keep them from chasing such straw men?</p>

		<p>Racist body language??? I guess institutional racism has run its course. Gotta come up with a new bogey man. And one that is impossible to pinpoint as it is nothing but conjecture. A perfect scapegoat. Kinda like saying an inanimate object is racist. How do you prove or disprove something that is opinion and open to an individual&rsquo;s interpretation???  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an actor, but in the real world the non-verbal cues he describes are invariably interpreted by black men as a sexual invitation.  I&rsquo;ve learned it&rsquo;s dangerous to &#8220;diss&#8221; blacks, but just as dangerous to give them positive cues which they&rsquo;re eager to misinterpret.  What a wearisome business it is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the white CHARACTERS who are reacting negatively against the black characters - it&rsquo;s the white ACTORS who are reacting negatively against the black actors. Check out this statement from the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ambady stresses that the black characters in the scenes selected were not criminals or impoverished, as often seen on television.Instead, the scenes came from enlightened series that portray blacks as social and intellectual peers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a medical drama for example, both the black and the white characters were doctors,&rdquo; Ambady said. Yet while the negative body language is certainly not scripted, she was not sure if it reflects innate reactions by the white actors, is directorial in origin, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>White actors in Hollywood today are held hostage - the screenplays and the casting directors put them in the uncomfortable situation of pretending that the black actor in front of them is just as intelligent as they are. We&rsquo;ve all seen hundreds of TV shows in which the black &#8220;professional&#8221; (doctor, lawyer, etc) is busying spouting off fancy lines with big words that real blacks never use. Blacks who play doctors and lawyers almost always seem unnatural because their scripted words are coming from white writers. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try a different scenario - analysis footage of white actors who are interacting with &#8220;regular&#8221; blacks who speak naturally. I think you&rsquo;ll find that BOTH races will be more at ease with such dramatic scenes because the characters are speaking NATURALLY. </p>

		<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll bite;<br>
Whites, by and large, today, as always, display a plethora of defensive behavious toward nonwhites.<br>
It&rsquo;s deeply rooted in INSTINCT and COMMON SENSE. We&rsquo;re talking about the deeply genetic intelligence that lefty educators and armchair intellectuals love to make fun of (while they exemplify these behaviors to the hilt, no less)!<br>
Whites justifiably fear blacks. Everybody else on the planet does, too. On every level of skin pigmentation, from the developed world, to the bush in the third world, dark skin is looked down upon.<br>
I didn&rsquo;t cast the mold of thought that humanity carries, so don&rsquo;t blame me.<br>
I&rsquo;m just pointing out the obvious. And the obvious is precisely what lefty loonies cannot accept.<br>

<p>When was the last time these &#8220;researchers&#8221; (assuming one calls this research) watched TV?  In the 1970s?  Television seldom shows poor blacks, and almost never shows criminal blacks, unless they&rsquo;re henchmen of some even more evil white guy, in one of those multi-racial crime gangs that do not exist outside the minds of screenwriters.</p>

		<p>Many of you seem to think that this research is showing, or supposedly showing, that the actors themselves were racist. I don&rsquo;t think so. Actors control their body language just as they control the tone of their voice. If the actors came across as less friendly on average towards the black actors this was entirely intentional.</p>
<p>Knowing American T.V. they were probably playing jerks who were supposed to have negative reactions to the saintly blacks. Or maybe they were more often being shown to be wrong or to be fools by the black characters and were acting chagrined and defensive.</p>

		<p>Take away the racist scarlet letter and this study is just  proving is that deep down White people maybe, simply feel uncomfortable being around black people period.<br>
Perhaps it&rsquo;s because we have to constantly think about how to act while being around them.<br>
Balancing internal convert caution, restraining laughter (or eye rolling) while projecting outward normality takes energy.</p>
<p>Even trying not to appear racist outwardly can be exhausting in itself. It does help that as time goes on, sensitivity goes up.</p>
<p>The fact that even these professional thespians whose profession expects them to able to emulate &#8216;real people&rsquo; to be believable, also can not hide the fact that themselves are uncomfortable in these physical situations is hilarious in itself. <br>
What hope does that give us amateurs?</p>
<p>Also most of these fictional Black characters are so carefully engineered and are literally taken straight from the leftist&rsquo;s idealistic World hand book anyway, thus so far removed from anything resembling reality that it must be nearly impossible to keep &#8216;the lie&rsquo; going seven days a week, well with sincerity.<br>
It&rsquo;s nice to know that there are some limits to the lies that the human mind can endure.</p>
<p>If look at some of the shows mentioned that were used in this study &#8220;Bones, Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy, CSI and Scrubs&#8221;, they&rsquo;re  all about medical/ forensic&rsquo;s experts. <br>
I would be apprehensive (even with) &#8216;a pretend&rsquo; Black doctor too.</p>
<p>This is just more sadomasochistic liberal self flagellation, these researchers are afraid of themselves and their true natures and are trying to &#8216;share their fear&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The fear of racism should really be listed as a new phobia. I notice that blacks act differently when there is a white person around but this doesn&rsquo;t bother me because I have also notice that women also act differently when a man enters a room. </p>
<p>Unless we all become mind controlled robots we are going to have certain feelings that can&rsquo;t be controlled. According to certain religious beliefs even God gave man free will to act on his own. If God gave man free will then what makes governments think they should be able to control even the subconscious thoughts of man.</p>
<p>If we are not careful we will end up as the first genetically modified species on the planet. We will end up as little more than mind controlled robots and even be programmed to think as directed, we will no longer be human.  </p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen these shows but I do remember about a decade ago, I was in a European nation and happened also to be taking a short language class. In the class were different European nationalities as well as a few Americans, including myself. There was also an American girl of Indian/Asian extraction. One day during a break the class were making small talk and as the Indian girl was carrying on (slightly giddish but attractive/ smart)..I noticed her gums were brown not just her skin.. I don&rsquo;t know but I felt there was a difference in her identity than the rest of us ..but the queer thing was I noticed a coolness come over the fellow students as If they felt something unnatural amongst them. I kind of felt uneasy for the girl because others would not laugh with her. I mentioned this (what seemed like instinctual rejection) to the guy I was rooming with that night, not knowing if I imagined it..? The next day the said girl was gone to a different school. I can&rsquo;t say for sure if it wasn&rsquo;t misunderstood by me, it could have been a reaction to her giddiness but I suspect her racial presence was part of the conclusion. Simply &#8220;Birds of a feather&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;lets assume it is true, that groups tend to prefer their own across all races. Both consciously and unconsciously. Then what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, the argument races prefer their own, it has nothing to do with social conditioning. Well, if true, then we need affirmative action. At least in a white majority nation. And a whole jobs program in industry, entertainment, and government, covering every media outlet, explaining why we need it, why it&rsquo;s right, and an army of lawyer to sue those who don&rsquo;t adequately conform. </p>
<p>As to why we have no &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; in entire cities (soon to be entire states) now, run by non-whites, and of course in non-white countries, that&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess. Well to be honest, majority non-white employers and schools do still have affirmative action, and a special sensitivity to diversity, too, by which they also mean people of color.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that could be explained away too if anyone is interested in it. </p>

<p>My own personal observations and experience would tend to indicate, particularly with the genre of the sitcom, that whites are normally cast as bumbling dolts, whereas blacks are almost invariably cast as smart, intuitive, and weary in their role of endlessly correcting the mistakes and misperceptions of their dullard white counterparts.</p>

		<p><i>Ambady stresses that the black characters in the scenes selected were not criminals or impoverished, as often seen on television. </i></p>
<p>On what shows, other than <i>The First 48</i> and <i>Cops</i> are blacks &#8220;often seen&#8221; as criminals?  It&rsquo;s a sign of just how totalitarian public debate is in this country that the white-hating racists who run television can get away with  showing virtually all murders being committed in the cities they are set in as being committed by whites, when in reality 90% plus are committed by non-whites.   It&rsquo;s pure, blood libeling, racism.  The cops are multi-racial, the DAs and Judges are multi-racial, the lab techs and scientists are multi-racial,  the criminals are all white.   You can&rsquo;t separate this practice from the media practice of downplaying or covering up real non-white crime, particularly non-white crime against whites (the &#8220;hush-crime&#8221; phenomenon), they are part and parcel of a whole propaganda campaign designed to sell multi-racialism, and the direct result of that campaign is that a lot of people are being butchered in the street.   If you want to strike a blow against Liberal white-hating racism there is no better place to start than highlighting and attacking this odious practice,  there&rsquo;s no way Liberals can defend this out-and-out racism, they&rsquo;d scurry like cockroaches from a determined effort against it.   It&rsquo;s a sign of the depth of the collaboration between prominent Conservatives and the traitorous left that they have never had to.</p>
<p><i>Instead, the scenes came from enlightened series that portray blacks as social and intellectual peers.</i></p>
<p>Enlightened being used in its traditional meaning of anti-white and dishonest.  </p>
<p>There always seems to be enough money and time for academia to indulge in studies like divining the racist body language of those wascally white folk, but they never seem to get around to studying the connection between leftist politics and the racist mass-rape of millions of whites by non-whites since the 1960s.  Or the mass-murder of tens of thousands, or the maiming or injuring of tens of millions of whites at the hands of non-whites since then.   The fact that whites can&rsquo;t walk safely in a large number of the streets maintained by their tax dollars and built by their ancestors - real racism and civil rights violations -  never seems to arouse the interest of the Max Weisbuchs of this world, nor the <i>Toronto Stars</i> for that matter.  This is the real answer that should be given every time stories like this appear, and soon they won&rsquo;t appear any longer.  As I said, they&rsquo;d scurry like cockroaches if they didn&rsquo;t have conservatism to protect them. </p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;We took out the target character, who was either black or white, and the (remaining) character was always white,&rdquo; senior study author Nalini Ambady said in an interview with the Star.</i></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the problem in a nutshell.  They never even bothered to find out if blacks exhibited negative body language towards whites.  This is to further the myth that only whites can be racist.</p>
<p>I found it particularly amusing that one of the shows they studied was &#8220;House&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t have a television but I do have a computer which now means that I really <i>do</i> have a television   &mdash;   I checked out some episodes on hulu.com.  One thing that immediately sticks out is that the prettiest white woman in the show sleeps only with other women (white or Asian) or with the black male doctor   &mdash;   anybody but a white man.  While there may or may not be politically incorrect body language discernible only by my subconscious mind, the consciously explicit message is obvious - hot women are bisexual and miscegenate.</p>
<p>Now it may very well be that the white actors exhibit more positive body language towards other white actors than they do towards black actors.  So what?  That just means people prefer their own kind.  Even liberal actors in liberal Hollywood.  It takes a leftist to see this as a problem that needs to be ameliorated, rather than just a fact of life that should be acknowledged.</p>

Blacks who play doctors and lawyers almost always seem unnatural because their scripted words are coming from white writers. </p>
<p><br>
I too have noticed this, many a time. Black actors mouthing words black people never say. And speaking in complex, lengthy sentences, with dependent clauses, and polysyllabic technical language that simply doesn&rsquo;t sound convincing coming out of black mouths. And I&rsquo;ve noticed this even when the black actor is a talented one. </p>
<p>(Which reminds me of the time a friend observed that &#8220;There are probably more beautiful &#8216;lipstick lesbians&rsquo; in movies and TV than in all of the real world.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yeah   &mdash;   same with black doctors and scientists.&#8221;) </p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s something else to factor into your considerations of this study: a weird little psychological phenomenon film critics call &#8220;The Kuleshov Effect.&#8221; From Wiki:</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;[Soviet cinema pioneer Lev] Kuleshov edited together a short film in which a shot of the expressionless face of Tsarist matinee idol Ivan Mozzhukhin was alternated with various other shots (a plate of soup, a girl, a little girl&rsquo;s coffin). The film was shown to an audience who believed that the expression on Mozzhukhin&rsquo;s face was different each time he appeared, depending on whether he was &#8220;looking at&#8221; the plate of soup, the girl, or the coffin, showing an expression of hunger, desire or grief respectively. Actually the footage of Mozzhukhin was the same shot repeated over and over again. Vsevolod Pudovkin (who later claimed to have been the co-creator of the experiment) described in 1929 how the audience &#8220;raved about the acting&hellip;. the heavy pensiveness of his mood over the forgotten soup, were touched and moved by the deep sorrow with which he looked on the dead woman, and admired the light, happy smile with which he surveyed the girl at play. But we knew that in all three cases the face was exactly the same.&#8221;[1] Kuleshov used the experiment to indicate the usefulness and effectiveness of film editing.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
In short: context is <i>very</i> important to what viewers <i>think</i> they&rsquo;re seeing. The Kuleshov Effect indicates there&rsquo;s a lot of room for interpretation with this kind of stuff   &mdash;   something the &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; who conducted this study aren&rsquo;t adequately taking into account. They&rsquo;re merely jumping to the conclusion that (as other posters have noted) white people continue to be horrible racists even when they have no idea they&rsquo;re being that way at all. </p>
<p>Oh, and one final factor you should also consider: Never believe ANYTHING you read in the Toronto Star. </p>

		<p>Perhaps even the ultra-liberal actors who make these shows can&rsquo;t get away from reality. White people love blacks in movies and TV so much because they can&rsquo;t stand the actual ones they come up against in the street or in the workplace. Another explanation would be that the behaviors that they would use with other Whites to show interest or empathy would either be patronizing or showing subservience if done with blacks. </p>
<p>To answer the question about bluegums, I have always heard that as a description of a black who refuses to lift a finger at work, and allows his or her &#8220;team&#8221; (Whites, of course) to finish the job. It is kind of like in Iraq where Whites are in the combat and patrol positions and the blacks and Latinos are in supply positions doing what they do best. </p>

		<p>I am an actor.  Playing villains is much more fun than being the good guy.  The Black hero actors are being cheated.  </p>

		<p>The appalling thing I see in all of these responses is that so many White people are still watching network television.<br>

		<p>The only solution I can see is not to put anymore black doctors, scientists or black anything in these shows other than some more realistic characters they wouldn&rsquo;t have to interact with like a an extra in a police lineup or a motel maid.  These contemporary shows are nothing but garbage anymore and almost 90 percent of the time there is an agenda attached to them.  If it&rsquo;s not trying to make minorities look better than Whites then it&rsquo;s bashing Christianity or promoting homosexuality or some other warped values.  Whatever happened to the feel good entertainment of 30 years ago with beautiful people, beautiful places and positive messages?  Nowadays you have these boring reality shows with someone working in a restaurant kitchen with self absorbed characters with alot of scripted drama written into their parts.  Then there&rsquo;s the show with the gay guy who counsels overweight dateless women with low self-esteem.  Not about going on a diet, eating healthy and exercising but developing a positive attitude and buying a new wardrobe.  To think that some woman would follow this kind of advice from someone who probably spends his romantic evenings tapping his foot in a public bathroom stall.     </p>

		<p>&#8220;try the reverse experiment and see if there&rsquo;s bias in black characters talking to whites&#8221;</p>
<p>If the experiment were reversed, and blacks were studied in a negative light, the whole thing would be seen as offensive. There are probably laws against it. And the results wouldn&rsquo;t be considered enlightened scholarship, but something only fit to print somewhere like AmRen, and considered &#8216;hate&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Why does any self respecting White person care, or even pay any attention to what is on television?  It is all just brainwashing.  The mainstream media is controlled by a certain group who has an agenda which is to rid the world of White western society.  </p>
<p>Please refer to my moniker.</p>

		<p>Under other circumstances I certainly plan on killing my TV. Right now I am a stay at home mom whose husband travels much of the time and I do not have much of a support network in the city where I live. As my now two year old gets older we plan on either cutting the television totally or keeping it in our bedroom where I can be in total control of what she sees. Someone on this website said that the word &#8220;programming&#8221; as in &#8220;television programming&#8221; has more than one meaning. This is so true, simply watch one of the afore mentioned programs and you will see what I mean. Often the plot will go something like this: A bigoted straight White male has some sort of colflict with a minority or gay colligue or client and the rest of the show has the gay, minority and female cast members instructing the bigot on how he should really feel toward said other colligue or client. The end of the show is predictable, the bigot is now reformed and thinks the same way as the rest of the bleeding heart cast. Don&rsquo;t take my word for it, watch any show at random this week (better still wait until all of the holiday specials are over) and see if I am not right. The background stories might be different but the main theme will be almost exactly what I have stated. </p>

		<p>A lot of insightful comments on this article. All I have to add is that if they were to do a study like this on me, then they&rsquo;d find that hell yeah, I&rsquo;m more comfortable around whites than blacks, or any other race for that matter. </p>
<p>The principle is simple and obvious: we are most comfortable around those most like us. It&rsquo;s as natural as can be, and there absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s unnatural is trying to engineer and compel humans to act against their natural impulses.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to avoid these racial scenes.<br>
I fir one wil nt watch any American TV programmes as whites are always depicted as being &#8216;racist&rsquo; or biased in some way.  In addition the crime / police sitcoms always have a black guy in charge to push his white subordinates around a little.<br>
Blatant brainwashing &amp; propaganda. If you watch it Hollywood will only dish up more for you.  Stop watching &amp; when ratings drop, advertising revenue drops, then you may get some decent TV again.  Your choice!!</p>

		<p>The black actors playing these doctors, lawyers, etc. just stick out like sore thumbs. How do the white actors even keep a straight face when medical dialog is being mouthed by somebody who comes across as a community college basketball player? How can viewers take it seriously? That&rsquo;s the root of the body language.</p>
<p>On a similar note, I&rsquo;ve noticed on the Price is Right they are trying to make the black model &#8220;Laneesha&#8221; the lead model. She is not attractive, has no personality or charisma. I floors me that she even is willing to share the stage with two white beauties like Rachal and Amber, who are flat out gorgeous and have personalities that simply radiate through the screen. They also have another light skinned black, Gwendolyn who is fairly attractive but not featured very much and a new Latina named Manuela, who is somewhat attractive but, ironically, much too dark to get on a Spanish language show.</p>
<p>Politically correct casting has destroyed today&rsquo;s entertainment. </p>

<p>Not just the casting but the directing, the writing, everything about it is of lower quality than the shows from decades ago.  They also try to make everyone look the same by using darker lighting/film, I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s involved but the majority of White people in the media look dark with black hair.</p>
