			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AOL Musica, December 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new &#8220;Christmas Song&#8221; re-arranged with lyrics hostile towards immigrants has been making the rounds on L.A.&rsquo;s radio and the Internet, generating controversy with every listen.</p>
<p>Parodying the classic song, &#8220;Feliz Navidad&#8221; (Merry Christmas), originally sung by Puerto Rican singer José Feliciano, this new track is titled &#8220;Illegal Aliens in My Yard&#8221; and was produced by Talk Radio Network&rsquo;s Matt Fox and AJ Rice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The song cruelly mocks the situation of thousands of undocumented immigrants in the United States, particularly Latino immigrants, as the chorus repeats the phrase &#8220;Illegals in my yard&#8221; three times, followed by &#8220;Throw them some pesos and they work so hard&#8221;.</p>
<p>This track goes on to depict immigrants with negative stereotypes, calling them &#8220;illegals&#8221; and even worse, as carriers of contagious diseases such as tuberculosis and the bubonic plague.</p>
<p>The lyrics also state that this Christmas, the &#8220;illegals&#8221; will shovel all the snow, clean their cars, dig up pools, landscape the lawn, and cook some tacos among other stereotypical activities, like drinking tequila and beer at the bar.</p>
<p>At the heart of the controversy is whether this song is nothing more than a silly parody, or whether it is just the latest in a growing trend of anti-immigrant vitriol that is seeping further into the mainstream, often in &#8220;innocent&#8221; ways.</p>

<p>Illegals in my yard.<br>
Illegals in my yard.<br>
Illegals in my yard.<br>
I don&rsquo;t even ask if they got green card.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to pave up my driveway this Christmas.<br>
They&rsquo;re going to clean all my cars this Christmas.<br>
They&rsquo;re going to shovel all the snow this Christmas.<br>
Those illegals in my yard.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to dig me a pool this Christmas.<br>
They&rsquo;re going to landscape my lawn this Christmas.<br>
They&rsquo;re going to cook me up some tacos this Christmas.<br>
Those illegals in my yard.</p>

Illegals in my yard.<br>
Sixteen arrive in a stolen car.</p>
<p>Illegals in my yard.<br>
Illegals in my yard.<br>
Illegals in my yard.<br>
When they&rsquo;re not working, they sit at the bar.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to drink some cervezas this Christmas.<br>
They&rsquo;re going to shoot some tequila this Christmas.<br>
They&rsquo;re going to get DUIs this Christmas.<br>
Those illegals in my yard.</p>

Illegals in my yard.<br>
One at a time run past those border guards.</p>
<p>Illegals in my yard.<br>
Illegals in my yard.<br>
Illegals in my yard.<br>
Hugo Chavez sends his kind regards.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to tackle Pat Buchanan this Christmas.<br>
They&rsquo;re going to chase down Lou Dobbs this Christmas.<br>
They&rsquo;re going to join up with La Raza this Christmas.<br>
Those illegals in my yard.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to spread bubonic plague this Christmas.<br>
They&rsquo;re going to bring me lots of bed bugs this Christmas.<br>
They&rsquo;re going to pass tuberculosis this Christmas.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The song cruelly mocks the situation of thousands of undocumented immigrants&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And who put them in that &#8220;situation&#8221;?  They put themselves there, when they laced up their boots, deliberately sneaked past the Border Patrol, hired a coyote, or overstayed their visas.  There&rsquo;s not one thing in that song that isn&rsquo;t actually happening.  They ARE spreading diseases, getting DUIs, dropping anchor babies, and all the rest.  If they don&rsquo;t want to be &#8220;cruelly mocked,&#8221; then let them stay in their own countries, where I&rsquo;m sure everyone is much nicer than we cruel, awful Americans.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They sit at the bar&#8221;. Reminds me of a revelation a room mate had while watching an old  Mexican movie on Univision. He explained that in American Western cinematic editing the &#8220;cut-away&#8221; shot could be defined as &#8220;Meanwhile&hellip;Back at the ranch&#8221;. The camera goes from a girl in distress to ranch hands unaware lounging around the corral gate. The Mexican equivilent would be &#8220;Meanwhile&hellip; Back at the Cantina&#8221;. The camera goes from the Senorita in trouble to Men sitting unawares around a tequila bottle at the cantina. Fascinated, the more I watched the more his observations proved correct. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;This track goes on to depict immigrants with negative stereotypes, calling them &lsquo;illegals&rsquo; and even worse, as carriers of contagious diseases such as tuberculosis and the bubonic plague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughably, that sentence above demonstrates the full nature of this problem.</p>
<p>1.) it is not a &lsquo;negative stereotype&rdquo; to call them illegal aliens, because that is what they are. Calling them &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; or the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; does not change this fact, even if you do it until you turn into a blue corn chip. </p>
<p>2.) Yawn, more of the same; the contagious diseases are just the tip of the iceberg. The rapes, murders, and drunken vehicular &ldquo;incidents,&rdquo; are far more frequent and relevant examples of the &ldquo;enrichments&rdquo; these invaders bring to the USA. Or put another way, not only do they carry &ldquo;contagious diseases,&rdquo; they are horrendously and erratically animated socioeconomic afflictions as well.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Song cruely mocks illegal aliens,etc. say liberals.</p>
<p>Of course they do. This is par for the course, for liberals. What illegal immigration does to the long time taxpaying, American citizens, is of course, nothing to bother about where these same liberals are concerned. Why on earth would any honest hardworking American citizen belong to the Democrat party? Unless they are a government worker, or priviledged in some other entitled way always involving the Democrats, WHY, WHY WOULD PEOPLE SUPPORT THEM!!??</p>

<p>&#8220;Undocumented immigrants&#8221;?  That&rsquo;s like calling a street drug dealer an &#8220;unlicensed pharmacist.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the fact that they lack documentation, but that they BROKE THE LAW by crossing the border illegally.  They are law-breakers.  Call them law-breakers.  Emphasize the fact that they broke the law   &mdash;   law-breakers.<br>

		<p>The REAL Jose Feliciano version is so obnoxious, I stay out of stores from Thanksgiving &#8216;til December 26, in order to avoid having my ears poisoned with it.  Anyway, there&rsquo;s another alternate version out there&hellip; &#8216;Police at My Door&rsquo;&hellip;also heart-warming.</p>
<p>But my personal fave is Amandititita&rsquo;s &#8216;Cuanto Navidad&rsquo;.  Great video&hellip;with Amandititita dressed in black, flipping-off an entire Christmas Mall in Mexico City.  Hey&hellip;I confess to liking a lot of new Mexican music, particularly Amduscia and Hocico.  As long as they stay in Mexico, I wish them all the best.</p>
<p>But back to Feliciano&rsquo;s most obnoxious hits: does anyone remember &#8216;Old Turkey Buzzard&rsquo;, from Mackenna&rsquo;s Gold?  So cringe-worthy, you&rsquo;ll jump out of your own skin.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps. But when did it become so offensive for American citizens, to have a laugh at people who live illegally in their country, creating all sorts of problems?</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegals&#8221; as they are called, shouldn&rsquo;t be there in the first place, and many of them work without paying a single dollar in taxes, while many others join street gangs. As if the US didn&rsquo;t have enough problems, already.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t feel too sensitive about having a laugh at those people, myself.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know how old you are, and you might not remember this, but in 1968, Jose Feliciano sang the national anthem before the start of a World Series game. He ended with, &#8220;yeah, yeah, yeah&#8221;, and practically sent the MSM into a convulsion, by doing so.</p>
<p>This was a year which already saw King and Bobby Kennedy assassinated, race riots from sea to shining sea and Vietnam War protests nationwide. </p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t anyone realize that this song serves to relieve, via humor, the hate/fear of 12 million &#8220;ILLEGAL&#8221; (not Undocumented) immigrants currently in the United States.  When people become offended at this they are the people being racist, as they are the ones whom wish to put forth the &#8220;Race Card&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps with people so upset over this issue it would be better to try to use humor avoid real riots.  remember the in the 1950&rsquo;s perhaps 12 million &#8220;Illiegal Immigrants&#8221; were DEPORTED under Presidential Order.  Who wants to see history repeated?</p>

Song cruely mocks illegal aliens,etc. say liberals.</p>
<p>Of course they do. This is par for the course, for liberals.  Unless they are a government worker, or priviledged in some other entitled way always involving the Democrats, WHY, WHY WOULD PEOPLE SUPPORT THEM!!??</p>
<p>I hate to break it to you Bobby. The Republicans ARE NOT much better. I voted for W and his was one of the worst race traitors in HISTORY. I will never again give the time of day to a so-called &#8220;compassionate conservative.&#8221; I will write in a candidate, or more likely, I probably won&rsquo;t vote. People say &#8220;then you can&rsquo;t complain&#8221;. The hell I can&rsquo;t. I am a taxpayer who works 50 plus hours a week, supporting a wife and daughter. My wife works and is also a taxpayer. I don&rsquo;t owe anyone an explanation if I choose not to vote. Both parties are corrupt, and I don&rsquo;t see it changing.</p>

		<p>Whiteguysrevenge:</p>
<p>Thank you.  </p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been old enough to use my own brain, I&rsquo;ve always been insulted by the PC axiom that &#8220;if you don&rsquo;t vote you can&rsquo;t complain about the politicians/system/conditions/etc.&#8221;  We have a 1st Amendment in this country, meaning you do have a right. </p>
<p>However, to say that you don&rsquo;t have a right to complain if you don&rsquo;t vote is also saying that politicians have permission to be as abusive to you if you don&rsquo;t vote, and corrupt with your tax money, only if you don&rsquo;t vote.  I find that condescending to people who, for whatever reason, don&rsquo;t want to vote.  (IMHO, not voting is a form of voting.  It means you don&rsquo;t have a dog in the race, nor do you see much of a difference between tweedles.  If that isn&rsquo;t expressing an opinion, what is?)</p>
