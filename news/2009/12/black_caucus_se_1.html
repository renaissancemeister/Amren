<h1>Black Caucus Sends Strong Economic Message to Obama</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed Hornick, CNN, December 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Members of the Congressional Black Caucus called on President Obama Friday to address the skyrocketing unemployment rate facing minorities  &mdash;  especially African-Americans and Latinos  &mdash;  and greater economic conditions plaguing low-income communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our job is to make sure the legislation that gets to the president&rsquo;s desk responds to the degradation and the crisis in our community,&#8221; said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, at a Friday news conference. &#8220;Our community is bleeding. And we are the worst hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The letter  &mdash;  titled &#8220;Change Course, Confront Crises, Continue the Legacy&#8221;  &mdash;  also indicates that the CBC wants, among other things:</p>
<p># 10 percent of all job programs earmarked for low- income communities</p>
<p># Utilize the unused TARP funds for job creation programs</p>
<p># Invest money in green jobs and new technology</p>
<p># Increase funding for youth summer jobs programs and adult apprenticeships</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, has said that the jobs programs to date haven&rsquo;t done enough to address the unemployment issue affecting minority communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for the president, Chairwoman Lee said in a recent press release that while she praised Obama&rsquo;s concerns about the economy, &#8220;much more needs to be done, particularly for those Americans who are hurting most.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated that a jobs bill is likely to come up next week that would provide help for struggling small businesses and hard-hit communities and extend unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some reporters at Friday&rsquo;s news conference asked caucus members why the focus is on minorities and not everyone who is struggling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not talking about race. We&rsquo;re talking about hardest hit, where their unemployment rates are the greatest,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re talking about qualified areas of economic hardship, where 20 percent or more of the population is or at below the poverty line and we want at least 10 percent of the resources targeted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s colleague  &mdash;  Rep. David Scott, D-Georgia  &mdash;  also reiterated that the CBC&rsquo;s concern isn&rsquo;t &#8220;based on the foundation of race,&#8221; but rather focused on the &#8220;foundation of need.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The percentage of blacks that are unemployable has to be atleast triple the rate of any other ethnic group.  Blacks drop out of school at a rate that is several times that of whites.  Money can be dumped into blacks&rsquo; hands by the truckloads and it will change nothing.  It is hard reality, and one that so called &#8220;egalitarian&#8221; liberals will never admit, that simply blacks cannot compete in this society, even when government programs are implemented to tilt opportunities in their favor.  A few decades cannot overturn millions of years of evolution.    </p>

I&rsquo;ve written too many times about my experience with black workers so I&rsquo;ll take a different route.</p>
<p>If black leaders want more blacks to be employed they have to focus their efforts like this:</p>
<p>Blacks need to understand that no one gives you a job. You go out and find one. Then you prove to your employer that you&rsquo;re a dependable and reliable worker who is an asset to the company.</p>
<p>Too many blacks don&rsquo;t seem to understand this common sense wisdom.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Surprise: Black Caucus wants more handouts for blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the health care debacle is over&hellip;.one way or another&hellip;.the messiah will continue with his pro-black community organizing agenda, but first he must see to it that his pro-black health care pursuit is fulfilled.  </p>
<p>The Black Caucus is too dense to understand that the entire concept has nothing to do with healthcare and everything to do with implementing social programs, like qualifying blacks to be doctors when they couldn&rsquo;t do the course work on their own ability.  </p>
<p>Under the health care debacle it is mandated that med schools have a proportionate number of blacks and Hispanics to equal whites, Orientals, and other Asians.  There are many other provision that are strictly for the purpose of assisting unqualified non-whites some way, most especially blacks.</p>
<p>But wait awhile.  2010 has been forecast to be the year when we are going to begin the process of economic deterioration at a more rapid rate.</p>
<p>A few top economists are predicting a situation so dire they&rsquo;re afraid the only way out for Obama is to start a war in the Middle East to help pull us out of the depression were entering, just as FDR&rsquo;s WWII finally brought the country out of the first great depression.</p>
<p>My God, what a mess that would be.   If the country goes to war with, say, Iran.  Home grown terrorists would be attacking within, and civil unrest would be the order of the day between the races domestically.  We WOULD NOT be a united country as we were in WWII when everybody pulled together.</p>
<p>The American Empire is on the way out.</p>

		<p>President Obama&rsquo;s extensive experience as a community-organizer, aka as one who marshals a group of voluntary charity cases to demand gifts from those who work for their daily bread, uniquely qualifies him to use the presidential authority to lobby for handouts and sign bills that redistribute the meager assets accumulated by blue and gray collar workers to constituents of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>
<p>No one knows how much workers from all ethnic groups will tolerate the government taking their hard earned wages and giving it to deadbeats who demand conception to grave care from  a growing impoverished society but there is clearly a breaking point.</p>
<p>Are we approaching that point?</p>

		<p>Number 5, the answer to your question is YES!  Freedom is only an illusion in this country anymore.  So many people are afraid of this government.  I heard an email is going around that says that obama is g. bush in blackface.  The rothchilds and bolsheviks murdered my people and I will stand against them here.<br>
This whole faultering economy was engineered by the rothchilds who are pushing for the carbon tax,. which equals taxing us for the air we breathe.  Only the productive will be made to pay. Communism=stealing from the productive to give to the lazy and irresponsible.  Everyone do your own research on youtube and get some history lessons.  Those who forget history tend to repeat it.  </p>

<p>The fed GIVES jobs to blacks. Blacks seldom LOOK for jobs. No White in his/her right mind would hire a black because they are NEVER assets to a White business, in my experience and reading, they are only a plaintiff waiting to get fired by a defendant.</p>

		<p>Once again, it&rsquo;s the Congressional Black Caucus this, the Congressional Black Caucus that.  If we&rsquo;re all &#8220;equal,&#8221; then why does a Congressional Black Caucus exist <i>at all</i>?  And why isn&rsquo;t there a Congressional <i>White</i> Caucus?</p>
<p>Are White americans really so brainwashed that they can&rsquo;t ask these obvious questions?  Apparently so, but what will it take to snap them out of their trance?</p>

		<p>This is so nauseating.</p>
<p>This is pure racially-based, re-distribution of wealth and it should be offensive to every working class white person struggling in this economy.</p>
<p>And to any white leftist out there who thinks that class trumps race, remember stories like this - blacks and latinos always close ranks and defend their own. You should too.<br>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t blacks get off their lazy collective butts and work and make it on their own?  I&rsquo;m sick of their complaining and groveling for handouts and &#8216;uplifting.&rsquo;  I&rsquo;m more sick of having to support people that don&rsquo;t allow me to have freedom of association.  I&rsquo;m even more sick of people who hate me, yet I&rsquo;m obligated to support them.</p>
