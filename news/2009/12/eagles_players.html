<h1><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/Eagles-players-honor-Michael-Vick-with-award-for?urn=nfl,210601">Eagles Players Honor Michael Vick With Award for Courage</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Chase, Yahoo! Sports, December 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, the Eagles announced that Michael Vick was the 2009 winner of the Ed Block Courage Award, an honor given to a player who shows courage in the face of adversity. Vick&rsquo;s teammates voted for the award, thus demonstrating how tone-deaf and out-of-touch NFL players are with reality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One recipient is selected from each NFL team, usually for things like coming back from injury, doing good work in the community or long, dedicated service to a franchise. I&rsquo;d be surprised if the award&rsquo;s founders intended for the honor to be given to someone doing community service as part of the terms of his parole or for showing courage in the face of reporters asking legitimate questions about federal crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Apparently Philadelphia players confuse Vick handling dogfighting questions and booing with a measure of class as some sort of courage.  That Vick only got a chance to show this mild courageousness because of the extreme cowardice it takes to murder helpless animals isn&rsquo;t something that crosses their mind. They confuse Vick&rsquo;s desperation with some sort of integrity.</p>

		<p>While it is true blacks are confused about the meaning of the word character, and really don&rsquo;t think Vick did anything wrong, we do need some perspective here.  Vick lost two years of his career, spent time in jail, and lost millions of dollars for his crime.  This is much more than a non celebrity would have lost in the same circumstances.  He didn&rsquo;t rape, murder, or assault a White person (at least that we know of), or even kill a White person&rsquo;s dog.</p>

		<p>I was unaware that an ex-con not committing any more felonies while out on parole was the essence of courage.  I always thought that it was a minimum standard of behavior for a felon out on parole, if he wants to stay out of prison.</p>
<p>Notice that the team members cast these votes.  What sort of imbeciles are they?  </p>
<p>To its credit, PETA was outraged at this award.  But, PETA members weren&rsquo;t exactly a conspicuous presence outside The Linc during Eagles games this season.  Of course we knew they&rsquo;d fold like a cheap deck of cards, b/c they had to be reminded that Mr. Vick is black, and that race trumps everything else liberal.</p>

		<p>It is newsers like Chase, who don&rsquo;t seem well grounded in reality. The Eagle demographics are ~11 White and ~49 non_White. Non-White men are indifferent to the suffering of animals, unless there is a personal reason for them to care. In addition, the Blacks regard Vick (with some justification) as a victim of judicial persecution. Thus it should be no surprise to a sports newser that Vick was voted a minor award by the eagles team. </p>
<p>Perhaps Chase knows this but is just catering to the ignorance of his or her readers. With newsers it&rsquo;s hard to know whether they are ignorant or they assume their audience is ignorant, and want to keep them ignorant.</p>

		<p>Yes, few things in life are more &#8220;courageous&#8221; than swinging a little pupping around in the air by a leash attached to a neck collar and then slamming the puppy into a concrete floor, killing it, because it was too sweet a dog to be a good fighter.  Yep, so&hellip; so courageous.  It&rsquo;s not like there was anything else you could do with the dog, like give it to a shelter or something&hellip; nah!&hellip; That would be stupid.  The concrete splattering was a much more &#8220;courageous&#8221; choice. </p>

		<p>I have often wondered about what poster #5 brought up.  I grew up in a setting fairly close to the natural world and developed a respect for the basic rights of animals to be treated humanely when handled and otherwise left alone when in the wild.  In my many years in a large urban area working with a large variety of people of all backgrounds, I have never seen or known a black person to treat animals with respect.  Any time I see black kids handling animals, it&rsquo;s always rough and on the edge of killing them.  Black adults jerk dogs around on their chains so badly, etc&hellip;  Hey what about santeria, the religion of cutting up live chickens?</p>

		<p>NO ONE seems to understand it is not so much the deplorable treatment of the dogs that matters with Vick as it is the mans addiction to gambling. NOT just penny ante gambling but big time and big money gambling. A professional athlete who is a gambler is a tremendous liability to his team and his sport. Vick by his actions has demonstrated a depraved mentality that hardly warrants any award of even employment in his &#8220;chosen&#8221; profession. </p>

		<p>A report shows that after failing an FBI polygraph test in October 2007 the former Atlanta Falcon quarterback recanted his denial and admitted taking part in the hanging of dogs from a nylon cord nailed to a tree and drowning others in a five gallon bucket of water.</p>
<p>Twice Vick put family pets into the fighting ring with pit bulls because he &ldquo;thought it was funny to watch the pit bulls&hellip; injure or kill the other dogs.&rdquo; Vick also admitted watching his friends hang, shoot and electrocute pit bulls.</p>
<p>Today, the Eagles announced that Michael Vick was the 2009 winner of the Ed Block Courage Award, an honor given to a player who shows courage in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>It really took a lot of courage to do what Vick did to helpless animals including his pets. What a couragous guy!</p>

		<p>I wholeheartedly agree that NO WHITES SHOULD BE WATCHING FOOTBALL
When I&rsquo;m at the gym, in the locker room, it disgusts and irritate me that I have to listen to nonstop blaring ESPN-whatever sports commentators (complete idiots) licking the boots of black thug athletes.<br>
They coddle the professional entertainers, and act like buffoons doing it. <br>
I never heard the word &#8216;I&#8221;, &#8220;me&#8221;, or have I ever heard so many people refer to themselves in the third person, as a black athlete being interviewed. Their shameless, idiotic, childish bravado would be disgusting, if you could take them seriously.<br>
It is so gauche, so insulting to be exposed to. Kill your TV.</p>

<p>So what if Vick lost time in jail, and millions in salary? He committed a crime and was convicted. He held illegal dogfights on his property. Just because it wasn&rsquo;t a criminal enterprise dealing in the white slave trade, for example; doesn&rsquo;t mean Vick didn&rsquo;t deserve what he got. He did.<br>

<p>   That&rsquo;s the key because in the liberal hierarchy of oppression blacks are higher than abused helpless animals. Being a &#8220;racist&#8221; is worse for some than torturing and abusing animals? I wonder what PETA thinks?</p>

<p>Of course Question Diversity you are absolutely right. If Vick was a white man PETA would have been at the Eagles games in force disrupting as much as they could. Vick got a pass because of his race. His teammates, who are predominantly black, supported him no matter what heinous acts he committed. One has only to recall the OJ verdict and the racial make up of the jury that sat through his trial.</p>
<p>Yes, Jedderman, it is about gambling, criminal activity and the like, but Vick&rsquo;s crime is also about cruelty. The sadistic treatment of innocent, defenseless dogs is an unspeakable crime. Not much is worse in the lexicon of criminal activity. Personally, I feel the torturing, killing, and mutilation of dogs is much worse than gambling. I would ask all AmRen bloggers and readers who is the bigger criminal Pete Rose or Michael Vick?</p>

<p>Michael Vick</p>
<p>&#8221;..The [dogs] that showed no taste for blood were killed   &mdash;   by gunshot, electrocution, drowning, hanging or, in at least one case, being repeatedly slammed against the ground&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an update on the dogs:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Since being rescued from the dogfighting ring financed by Michael Vick, all but a few of the abused pit bulls have been recovering in sanctuary, foster care and adoptive homes. Now even the most traumatized of them can have a happy new year&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the despicable PETA:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;PETA wanted Jasmine dead&hellip; The Humane Society of the U.S., agreeing with PETA, took the position that Michael Vick&rsquo;s pit bulls, like all dogs saved from fight rings, were beyond rehabilitation and that trying to save them was a misappropriation of time and money&hellip;&#8221; </p>

		<p>The bottom line is Micheal Vick is a coward. Any person who deliberately maims or kills an animal is a lowly human being. The same for anyone who chooses to intimidate a person because one thinks they are weak or docile and stupid to defend themselves. A person who has this attitude is the weak, docile and stupid one. Micheal Vick is by no means a man or a good athelete. He was born a thug and most likely will die a thug.</p>

<p>Now there&rsquo;s Arenas and some other African who apparently pulled handguns on each other in an NBA lockerroom. </p>
<p>Then, today&rsquo;s NYT had an article detailing the arrest of four University of Tennessee football players on drug and handgun charges.</p>
