<h1>New Delhi Launches No Peeing in Public Campaign</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WIBW-TV (Topeka), December 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Indian capital has launched a campaign to discourage urinating in public places  &mdash;  a common sight across the country.</p>
<p>The city of New Delhi, which is preparing to host the Commonwealth Games in October of next year, will soon be displaying large billboards along its gridlocked roads and on buses in a bid to embarrass those who urinate in public to end the practice, said Mayor Kanwar Sain.</p>
<p>The signs will feature three characters: Mr. Thu-Thu Kumar (the spitter), Mr. Kuda Kumar (the litterbug) and Mr. Su-Su Kumar (the person who pees in public).</p>
<p>&#8220;The capital of India must be clean. We see how clean are places like Singapore. Then, why not Delhi?&#8221; Sain said.</p>
<p>Authorities will launch a similar campaign on television and radio, he said.</p>
<p>Urinating, spitting and littering in public are acts punishable with a fine of $10 or more in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Deep Mathur, the spokesman for the city&rsquo;s municipal corporation, said offenders had been prosecuted. He could not provide immediate figures about prosecutions aimed at sanitation control.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Countrywide, India must build 112,000 toilets every day if it wants to meet its sanitation goal by 2012, according to the ministry of rural development.</p>

<p>Uh, try peeing on a sidewalk in Singapore and see what happens. Perhaps their slogan should be, &#8220;Can we be like Singapore? Yes we cane!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting question.  A fine of $10 or more?  What happens to those that can&rsquo;t pay?  That is a kingly sum by the standards of 90% of the people who live there.  And in most of that part of the world, failure to pay such a fine leads to being chain upside down to a dungeon wall.</p>
<p>What does it say when that level of punishment fails to curtail a nasty behavior such as public urination?</p>
<p>Here in the US, the occassional drunken frat boy will get caught peeing behind the dumpster in back of the club he just left.  The cops will inevitably give him a fine and a slap on the wrist.  But I guarantee that it would NEVER happen if the fine amounted to a years wages and if you didn&rsquo;t pay they threw you in a dirty hole and forgot about you.</p>

		<p>A few years ago we stayed in Hong Kong for over a month. Hong Kong had very strict laws about public urination, litter, spitting, and dog feces. A violation of any of these ordinances will result in a $2500HK fine which is about $200US. As a result, Hong Kong has the cleanest streets and parks of any city I have ever seen.</p>
<p>We were in mainland China for several weeks and it was very dirty even filthy compared to HK and the US. </p>

		<p>Many cities in the USA also have laws on the books against spitting and littering. Good luck with enforcement, India.</p>

		<p>It is way too late to nip this problem in the bud, obviously. If there are no toilet facilities available for the millions who live in the streets and/or shantytown shacks, what are you going to do? They have no money to pay the fines, and you can&rsquo;t build a jail big enough to hold that many people. India is a lost cause and can never be cleaned up, no matter what they try to do.</p>

Thats not all that is common, try mass defecation almost EVERYWHERE in India! I once saw an Indian man peeing in public in the parking lot of a Toronto shopping mall, his family stood by without a hint of shame or concern.</p>

		<p>Apparently, public defecation - an even more sensitive topic - is a common Indian practice.</p>

		<p>Sorry Chris N., but I lived in Singapore for two years and although the laws are all on the books, they are NOT enforced.  I remember cautioning my husband, before we ventured out for the first time, not to jaywalk and then we watched as everyone else did.  My husband&rsquo;s particular habit was to follow behind a gaggle of Chinese Singaporean young women as they blithely dropped their litter on the ground, and then to tap their shoulders and innocently hold up the trash, inquiring &#8220;Is this yours?&#8221; to their great embarrassment/loss of face.  Also, those anti-peeing laws are on the books for a reason.  Most of the Council housing (public/government-built housing) in Singapore consists of high rises, and there are urine-sensors in all the elevators, because Chinese men have a habit of urinating in them.  And surely you are aware that Chinese men must routinely hawk and spit in public to clear the &#8220;spit god&#8221; from their throat?</p>
<p>These laws on the books make Singapore sound oh, so strict, and it&rsquo;s true that they do cane for various infractions - a practice the U.S. should definitely adopt for our urban/foreign-born underclass.  However, the reason we don&rsquo;t need these laws (or didn&rsquo;t until our overwhelming cultural enrichment) is because our White, European population as a whole (there are always exceptions to every rule) didn&rsquo;t engage in this type of behavior.  </p>

<p>   I&rsquo;ve not heard this before from people who live in Germany. I can&rsquo;t see how it would be practical in some of the bitter cold winter months. I remember reading an article not too long ago as to how residents in a former East German town were irritated by immigrants peeing in public. Of course, this wasn&rsquo;t in multicultural Berlin. </p>

		<p>Well, that&rsquo;s good! That&rsquo;s really a step in the right direction, for Indian society.</p>
<p>But there is still much work to be done over there, because in parts of that same country, there are places where people will defecate on street corners, on bus or train seats, and other such public places&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that it&rsquo;s done openly, in front of others; but hygiene and public health are definitely issues to worry about, in such cases!</p>

		<p>Until one has actually visited India it is virtually impossible for a Westerner to comprehend how backward the Indian people really are.  Expecting East Indians to not urinate and defecate in public is akin to expecting feral dogs to use flush commodes and toilet paper&hellip;</p>

I have not heard of it either, nor seen it. I suspect that any who are so inclined would be foreigners, such as Turks or Arabs (of which Germany has plenty).  </p>
<p>In the Latin countries and throughout the Mediterranean, it is extremely common,  but not so in the northern countries. </p>
