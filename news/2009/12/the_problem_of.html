<h1>The Problem of Islamic Religious Persecution</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Doug Bandow, National Review, December 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The recent Swiss vote to ban the construction of minarets in that European nation has become the latest controversy to generate Muslim protests worldwide. However, Islamic governments are in no position to complain about Western intolerance and &#8220;Islamophobia.&#8221; Most Muslim nations are repressive or offer only limited political freedom. More often than not, Islamic states violate basic human rights; and almost all persecute Christians, Jews, and other religious minorities.</p>
<p>Many authoritarian states  &mdash;  especially Communist or formerly Communist ones  &mdash;  violate religious liberty along with other freedoms in order to maintain political control. But Muslim nations are almost unique in their willingness to persecute religious minorities to promote religious ends, as is evident from the State Department&rsquo;s latest report on religious liberty abroad.</p>
<p>The State Department refers to &#8220;state hostility toward minority or non-approved religious groups,&#8221; as if different faiths randomly oppressed different faiths. However, Islam has distinguished itself with the willingness of governments and individuals to harass, attack, jail, and kill members of other religions. Even the most moderate and tolerant Islamic states often fall far short of respecting religious minorities. {snip}</p>
<p>AFGHANISTAN</p>
<p>The U.S. expelled the Taliban government, but has not created a free society. Although the Karzai government responded to outside pressure and took some steps to improve religious liberty, explains State, &#8220;the residual effects of years of jihad against the former Soviet Union, Taliban rule, civil strife, popular suspicion regarding outside influence of foreigners, and still weak democratic institutions hindered the realization of this aspiration.&#8221; Relations among different Muslim sects &#8220;continued to be difficult&#8221;; non-Muslims face &#8220;harassment and occasional violence&#8221;; &#8220;most local Christians did not publicly state their beliefs or gather openly to worship.&#8221;</p>
<p>BRUNEI</p>
<p>{snip} The State Department reports that &#8220;non-Muslims were prohibited from receiving religious education in private religious schools, which had previously been allowed.&#8221; Moreover, &#8220;across denominational lines, non-Muslim religious leaders stated that they were subjected to undue influence and duress, and some were threatened with fines and/or imprisonment.  Active monitoring of churches and disruption of supply shipments and mail were reported.&#8221;  The authorities also limited the use of literature and worship places by religious minorities.</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>{snip} Moreover, the authorities &#8220;again failed to redress laws and governmental practices that discriminate against Christians, effectively allowing their discriminatory effects and their modeling effect on society to become further entrenched.&#8221; Christian converts from Islam were harassed and abused.</p>
<p>INDONESIA</p>
<p>The most populous Islamic nation, Indonesia long has reflected a more moderate variant of Islam. But Muslim extremists remain active and often unconstrained by the authorities. {snip}</p>
<p>IRAN</p>
<p>One of the uglier Islamic persecutors is Iran. The constitution nominally affirms the rights of &#8220;protected&#8221; religions  &mdash;  Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians. However, in practice no non-Shi&rsquo;a believer is safe. Explains the report:  &#8220;Respect for religious freedom in the country continued to deteriorate. Government rhetoric and actions created a threatening atmosphere for nearly all non-Shi&rsquo;a religious groups, most notably for Baha&rsquo;is, as well as Sufi Muslims, evangelical Christians, and members of the Jewish community. Reports of government imprisonment, harassment, intimidation, and discrimination based on religious beliefs continued.&#8221;  The state also promoted discrimination in the areas of education, employment, and housing. Iran is a Country of Particular Concern.</p>
<p>IRAQ</p>
<p>Tragically, liberating Iraq from Saddam Hussein meant liberating some of the worst sectarian passions, which he had brutally held in check. Roughly half of Iraq&rsquo;s historical Christian community has been displaced, many to Jordan and Syria, another secular Arab dictatorship. {snip} Although overall violence is down, Christians and other religious minorities continue to be targeted by radical Muslims.</p>
<p>MALAYSIA</p>
<p>This former British colony remains freer than Iran but not as free as Indonesia. {snip} Conversion from Islam is prohibited and, notes the department, &#8220;Religious minorities continued to face limitations on religious expression and alleged violations of property rights,&#8221; including prohibiting proselytizing of Muslims.</p>
<p>NIGERIA</p>
<p>The population is divided among Christian, Muslim, and traditional faiths. {snip} Although Christians are not free from all blame, the initiators more often have been Muslims and their victims more often have been Christians; there also have been reports of forced conversions to Islam as well as threats to extend Sharia law over non-Muslims.</p>
<p>PAKISTAN</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s ally in the war on terror is one of the least hospitable states for religious minorities. State notes &#8220;some positive steps to improve the treatment of religious minorities,&#8221; but Christians, Hindus, and Jews remain second-class citizens, if that. Explains the report: &#8220;Law enforcement personnel abused religious minorities in custody. Security forces and other government agencies did not adequately prevent or address societal abuses against minorities. Discriminatory legislation and the government&rsquo;s failure to take action against societal forces hostile to those who practice a different religious belief fostered religious intolerance, acts of violence, and intimidation against religious minorities.&#8221; Christians even risk execution if convicted of &#8220;blasphemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>SAUDI ARABIA</p>
<p>Another close U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia is among the globe&rsquo;s worst persecutors. At least Saudi Arabia makes no pretense. {snip} Moreover, explains State, &#8220;the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (CPVPV) continued to conduct raids on private non-Muslim religious gatherings.&#8221; The repressive kingdom has been designated a Country of Particular Concern.</p>
<p>SOMALIA</p>
<p>No surprise, this wreckage of a nation with an Islamic majority is not a good host for religious minorities. {snip} There were also reports that individuals who do not practice Islam experienced discrimination, violence, and detention because of religious beliefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>SUDAN</p>
<p>This tragic nation, whose Muslim north long has warred against its animist and Christian south, also is inhospitable land for religious minorities. After years of violent conflict, an accord of sorts was reached, theoretically ensuring religious freedom in the south while favoring Islam in the north. {snip}</p>
<p>TURKEY</p>
<p>Although the government generally respects freedom of religious practice, it restricts Islamic expression in education and official circumstances. {snip} Many Christians, Baha&rsquo;is, and heterodox Muslims faced societal suspicion and mistrust, and some elements of society continued to express anti-Semitic sentiments.&#8221;</p>
<p>YEMEN</p>
<p>Yet another failed or semi-failed Islamic state, Yemen enshrines Islam as the state religion, holds Shari&rsquo;a as the source of all law, bans conversion from Islam, and forbids proselytizing of Muslims. {snip} Private perpetrators of violence against religious minorities were not punished.</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s ability to aid religious minorities in other nations always will be limited. However, any Western dialogue with Islam must take into account the tendency of Islamic governments to persecute. For a start, the U.S. should suggest that Muslim governments that campaign against the &#8220;defamation&#8221; of religion start by respecting the freedom of conscience of those who live under their control. After all, murder is the ultimate form of defamation.</p>

		<p>I saw a documentary about Coptic Christians in Egypt.  Mostly, they were wealthy merchants and traders, but lived in the worst, most un down parts of Cairo - out of choice, because they simply were not tolerated in the more affluent areas by their Muslim neighbours.  </p>

		<p>There is a reason WHY this is so.  Islam is a false religion.  A cult of death founded by a maniac who was possessed by the devil (a fact Islam itself documents).</p>
<p>Christianity, on the other hand is a true religion.  It only takes a handful of true Christians to form a few churches and it quickly spreads far and wide.  The reason for this is simple.  Christianity is a TRUE religion, lol.  Something that is difficult to argue for but easily experienced by anyone who has a mind to seek out a church where the Holy Spirit comes.</p>
<p>The thing is the leaders of Islam KNOW all this.  They are quite desperate to keep this knowledge from the people of their countries because their power will dissolve right out from under them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s too late.  For example, I know for a fact that the majority of religious leaders in afghanistan have been exposed to real and true worship of Jesus Christ.  The main religious leader for all of afghanistan is probably already a convert due to direct experience of the presence of God.  The rest of them are not far behind.  Eventually, this will spread to the taliban.  In time, afghanistan and the rest of the middle east will once again be Christian.  Why?  Because God choose to take them back.  And no one and nothing can stop that from happening now.</p>
<p>What the US and Russia could never do by military force, bring peace, goodness, love and freedom to this pricipality of darkness, is well on its way to happening by other means.</p>

		<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve established that there is no real parity or reciprocity between Muslim nations and the Christian West when it comes to freedom of religion, we must accept the inescapable conclusion that this is what Muslims want to bring us here - the utter and irrevocable dominance of Islam worldwide, complete with all its trappings. We are fools to keep playing along.</p>

		<p>This is not surprising in the least.  Islamic (Sharia)law, which is the same for all Muslims in every country, states that Muslims have only 3 options for dealing with infidels (non-Muslims):  (1) Convert them; (2) Force them to live as second class citizens or dhimmis; or (3) Kill them.  So it doesn&rsquo;t matter what country the Muslims rule in, these 3 options are all that are open to non-Muslims.  This is absolutely UNIQUE to Islam; no other religion demands that its adherents forcibly convert non-members, and if they won&rsquo;t convert or live like animals, then kill them.  No other religion tells its people to kill folks who won&rsquo;t convert.  Islam&rsquo;s goal, therefore, is to take over the world, force every person in it to become Muslim, and kill all the ones who refuse.  Make no mistake, America - this IS the fact and therefore Islam is the greatest danger to the world as a whole today.</p>

		<p>I just got back from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  I was told that the Malays (who are most of the Muslims) are the majority, but the Chinese pretty much run everything.</p>
<p>Odd thing is that Luala Lumpur has alot of Christmas decorations in their malls and around the city, including manger scenes.  And yet, some groups in the United States tell us that Christmas displays are offensive to other religions.</p>
<p>Having been to both Malaysia and Indonesia, I would say Malaysia is freer than Indonesia.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=8643" rel="nofollow">https://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=8643</a></p>
<p>&#8220;During Umayyad rule, all kinds of often-progressive but theologically heretical ideas (i.e., rationalist Mutazilism) prospered unchecked in Muslim societies. Next, the Abbasid rulers, (750-1250), who rejected the Arab ways and adopted the Persian civilisation, further propped up the flourishing of this often-heretical intellectual tradition. The Persians already had a great tradition in intellectual exercise prior to Islam&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p> The Abbasids promoted science and philosophy even if it meant theological compromise. Caliph Al-Mamun (813-833), for example, even persecuted the orthodox; all his officials had to agree that the Koran was not divine but created by Prophet Mohammed. His policies continued during the subsequent rule of al-Mutassim (d. 842) and Al-Wathik (d. 847). Al-Wathik, embarrassingly for Muslims, became dubbed as the &ldquo;Commander of the Unbeliever&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This deviation from true Islam set the emergence of the Islamic Golden Age in motion, albeit on the wings of heresy and theological compromise of all sorts. We see the greatest-ever Muslim scientist and thinker, Al-Razi (d. 945), calling Prophet Mohammed a charlatan, a fraudulent trickster; responding to Allah&rsquo;s challenge of creating a book like the Koran, he called it an assorted mixture of &ldquo;absurd and inconsistent fables&rdquo;. The writings of Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, and Hippocrates - he asserted - contained much greater wisdom and brought greater service to humanity than the Holy Scriptures, which brought more harm than good.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was all to change soon. Islamic orthodoxy was gaining strength; it triumphed in Islamic societies by the spadework of legendary Islamic theologian Imam Ghazzali (d. 1111). He called Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina - his predecessor and the brilliant 11th-century philosophers and scientists of Muslim world - apostates, which demands death. Luckily for the latter, they had already left the world. &#8220;</p>

<p>Indeed you don&rsquo;t.   Good point.  I wondered about that when reading the story, as there was no mention at all of any such creature. (Odd that the report failed to mention them!)  Nor was there any mention of the Eastern religions, such as Buddhists. One has to conclude that there is no place for them in Islamic societies and no recognition or protection to be had. Badly off as Christians and Jews might be, at least they are &#8220;Peoples of the Book&#8221; and get some theoretical respect (if minimal).  But if you&rsquo;re one of the other categories, you simply don&rsquo;t exist at all, legally or socially.  You&rsquo;re outside the pale.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s time  (I&rsquo;d say past time!)  to establish the principle of reciprocity in dealing with Islamic nations.   </p>
<p>Example: if you don&rsquo;t allow churches to be built, we don&rsquo;t allow mosques. And so forth.    If it&rsquo;s fair for them, it&rsquo;s fair for us.  How can they complain?</p>

<p><br>
Muslims consider that Christians and Jews are &#8220;coming along&#8221;. These two groups are within the Biblical tradition. They have yet to be converted but already have one foot in the door, so to speak. They&rsquo;re on the right path to the one true religion and it&rsquo;s simply a matter of time. Islam can wait   &mdash;   Allah is patient. Meanwhile, they can be tolerated.</p>
<p>Others cannot. They are entitled to no such thing, at least in theory. The other groups are just heathens and infidels plain and simple. They don&rsquo;t count. For them, the Koran allows three options: conversion, slavery, or death. </p>
<p>(For instance, atheists are not allowed entry to Saudi Arabia. I would be curious about the policies of Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Pakistan: whether they inquire about these things. Probably so. But I am sure they must make  discrete allowances for e.g. the Chinese and Japanese, despite the strictures of the Koran. Power and money always have the last word.)</p>

<p>See my previous multiple comments on this subject&hellip;there is NO ROOM for a non muslim in a muslim world except as a slave!!! Like the terminator, they cannot be reasoned with, they don&rsquo;t feel pity or remorse and they are hard to kill.</p>
