			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, December 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Justice Department brought more federal hate crimes cases this year than in any year since 2001, and an Obama administration official said Thursday he was shocked by the drop-off in prosecutions during the Bush years.</p>
<p>Twenty-five hate crime cases were filed for the budget year that ended in September, a period that encompassed most of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s first year in office and the last few months of the Bush administration.</p>
<p>In 2001, there were 31 such cases filed. The number fell to a low of 12 in 2006, before starting to rise again, reaching 23 in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Perez [said Tom Perez, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s civil rights divisions] noted the number of hate crimes did not fall significantly during that period, but refused to say why he thought the federal prosecutions of such cases dropped.</p>
<p>Democrats harshly criticized the civil rights division during George W. Bush&rsquo;s presidency, saying lawyers there were not investigating aggressively hate crimes, housing and employment discrimination or police misconduct cases.</p>

		<p>Generally, the only thing that changes between Presidential administrations is the U.S. Attorneys for all the Federal trial level circuits.  The underling Federal prosecutors really don&rsquo;t leave   &mdash;   if they do, it&rsquo;s to run for office, be the rainmaker in a no-name law firm, retire, get a better and less stressful Federal job, get an appointment as a judge, and so on.  I think what explains it is that the Federal Prosecutors in 2009 are almost the same as the ones in 2008, save their bosses, so they&rsquo;re filing more hate crimes riders to suck up.</p>
<p>What is not explained here is the races of the suspects.  If most are all were white, I think it would say that.  But I think there are a lot of non-whites facing hate crimes riders, so the media have to cover it up.</p>

As AR readers are aware, the Obama administration isn&rsquo;t prosecuting &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; either; or at least being selective as to which crimes they believe are motivated by hate.</p>
<p>Heck, a pack of blacks attacked a white kid here in Buffalo and it was immediately made clear it wasn&rsquo;t a hate crime. Just a white kid in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/>

		<p>If a White says the &#8220;n word&#8221; it&rsquo;s a hate crime. If a non-White attacks, rapes or kills a White, it&rsquo;s not a hate crime.</p>

		<p>So this means that they will prosecute blacks for violently attacking Whites while screaming racial slurs or something like &#8220;this is a black world&#8221;? </p>
<p>I didnt think so&hellip;</p>
<p>But there will be more prosecutions of Whites who look at people funny or make some sort of comment that is taken offensive when none was meant. Now that the perception of the &#8220;victim&#8221; is considered for such prosecution these sorts of incidents will mushroom. </p>

		<p>By the definition of hate crime, which is to say crimes motivated by racial animus, virtually all such crimes are committed by by blacks against whites or Asians.</p>
<p>Yet it would appear that blacks are rarely if ever prosecuted for racially motivated crime.</p>
<p>Apparently the DOJ and prosecutors throughout the nation are interested only in the very occasional crime committed by whites against blacks, even though black on white crime is something like fifty times the obverse.</p>
<p>For all their chronic criminality, lack of productivity, disruptiveness, and lack of any tangible contributions (save such great cultural achievements as break-dancing and rap), black Africans in fact enjoy a hugely privileged status in this nation, immune to legitimate criticism, normal criminal penalties (despite rap-sheets covering several pages), and the expectation of normal behavior.</p>
<p>This can only go on so long before this country breaks apart, with other races marking out enclaves for themselves and declaring open season on blacks who try to cross the newly established lines.</p>

		<p>Face it Whitey, you are the underdog and you are going to pay for all the &#8220;privileges&#8221; you have had for centuries&hellip;..(sarcasm)</p>
<p>Nonwhites are really little children. They should be treated as such and sent to their room until they can function in a civilized world. But, I wouldn&rsquo;t hold my breath for that to happen. </p>

		<p>Gee, does this mean they&rsquo;ll prosecute the shooter at Ft. Hood for murder AND for a hate crime, since he yelled out, &#8220;Allahu Ackbar!&#8221;?  Probably not&hellip;.I guess we should be grateful they&rsquo;re going after him for murder&hellip;.</p>

		<p>This is easy to explain. The administration of GW Bush was a time of racial harmony. People of all races would stand together and sing Kumbya. Now this Barack Obama has ruined this. Curse him!</p>

		<p>Blacks are 11 times more likely to murder and 16 times more likely to commit interracial murder, that is 16 times more likely to murder a white person than the reverse. Not 50% more likely, or twice as likely, but 16 times. They are 34 times more likely to assault a white person, 104 times more likely to rob a white, and 600 times more likely to rape a white person, yet they are only 2 1/2 times more likely to be charged with an officially designated hate crime - and how many of those are crimes against Asian, Hispanics, immigrants or &#8216;gays&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Somehow the media manages to be even more biased than that, by not giving equal coverage to the 2 1/2 times more likely event, and usually showing hate as something that&rsquo;s exclusively white. </p>
<p>If the justice department is really looking for the unequal enforcement of laws in our nation, those figures and the reality behind them would be a good place for them to start looking. </p>

		<p>Come to think of it, shouldn&rsquo;t Whites be the only privileged in their own nations that they built and formed? What has happened to our thinking in the last several decades? Is it the water that we drink that only affects the White &#8220;cells&#8221;? </p>

		<p>The racial enclaving of the nation actually began a few decades after the Civil War, after many blacks had moved from the Deep South into border states, the North, and Midwest.  Many had settled into small towns, but then after several years the whites began to drive them out, and they ended up in cities, which became increasingly ghettoized.  Did whites just suddenly become racist, or did the behavior of too many blacks cause them to despair of co-existence?  Now that the ghetto denizens can roam freely into any neighborhood, people of all ethnicities are re-enclaving themselves into gated communities.  I wish we could create institutions that would resemble upgraded Indian reservations where the recipients of long-term welfare could be herded and kept within.  Want out?  Get a legitimate job and keep it.<br/>

		<p>Gated communities are springing up all over America, with the express purpose of allowing whites to at least feel safe in their own homes from blacks.  Gated, guarded, and armed houses and communities are a MUST in South Africa.  WHEN are whites going to see the connection?  NO fortress or laager is forever immune from attack and being overwhelmed by the enemy.  They ALL fall.  Retreating to defensive enclaves is not the solution.  Only when a vigorous offensive campaign is launched to completely defeat and subjugate an enemy, and destroying him, is there ever peace and safety FROM that enemy.  When Whites (here and in South Africa) had a strong united police force, policies of segregation keeping the blacks in their own communities, provided work for them within their abilities, and laws against intermarrying and interbreeding was there a possibility of living with blacks in your midst.  Only when there were harsh and immediate punishments for blacks raping, stealing, assaulting, or committing other crimes against whites was their criminal and violent behavior kept in control.  And until we return to those empirically proven methods of dealing with them, things will only get worse.  We are almost beyond the tipping point where we could halt and reverse all this.  South Africa stupidly allowed blacks to gain the upper hand.  There will NEVER be a return to South Africa of white safety, or national solvency now in that sorry place.</p>
