<h1><a href="/ar/1999/09/index.html">What We Are Supposed to Know</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, September 1999</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the July issue we reported that <a href="https://archive.nc-f.org/" target="ncf" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>New Century Foundation,</b></a> which publishes <cite>American Renaissance,</cite> had released a report called <a href="https://archive.colorofcrime.com/" target="color-of-crime" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>The Color of Crime: Race, Crime, and Violence in America.</b></a> Public reaction to this report has been such an instructive example of the way Americans deal  &mdash;  or fail to deal  &mdash;  with certain information, that we decided the story would interest our readers. Particularly in the context of how the media are currently handling other awkward facts, there is a pattern of concealment and denial that is dishonest and dangerous.</p>
<p>The report we released in June was, to be sure, not flattering to blacks. It noted, for example, that they are at least 50 times more likely to commit criminal acts of violence against whites than the reverse, and that they are as much more violent than whites as men are more violent than women. It also found that despite federal data-gathering methods that exaggerate the number of &#8220;hate&#8221; crimes committed by whites, blacks are still twice as likely as whites to commit such crimes. Other equally important findings were summarized in the July issue of AR.</p>
<p>The figures in the report were based on state and federal crime statistics that, taken together, are unassailable evidence that different racial groups in America commit violent crimes at vastly different rates. Because we knew these findings are so jarring to conventional minds, we included as appendices to the report facsimile pages from some of the government documents from which we took key figures.</p>
<p>In order to get maximum publicity for <cite>The Color of Crime,</cite> we held a news conference at the National Press Club to announce the report&rsquo;s release. We publicized the conference and the report as significant contributions to the current controversy over &#8220;racial profiling,&#8221; or the police tactic of stopping blacks more often than whites, on the assumption that blacks are more likely to be criminals.</p>
<p>Our efforts were successful. Even before the report was released, many big news organizations were asking for copies. The Associated Press, <cite>Time,</cite> CBS Evening News, National Public Radio, Knight-Ridder, and the <cite>Washington Times</cite> wanted advance copies rather than wait for the news conference. A dozen other media organizations, including the <cite>Washington Post,</cite> picked up the report at the conference itself. C-SPAN thought what we had to say was so important it broadcast the news conference live and then rebroadcast it several times. On the day we released the report we arranged to have it delivered to more than 450 news organizations in the Washington, DC, area.</p>
<p>What happened next? Almost nothing. With one exception, everyone who had wanted the report ahead of time decided to ignore it. The <cite>Washington Times</cite> stood alone in running a substantial news story, in which it interviewed several prominent criminologists who confirmed the accuracy of our numbers and added that they were simply too inflammatory to be discussed publicly.</p>
<p>Was this why everyone else decided to kill the story  &mdash;  because the facts were too inflammatory? I do not claim to know the motives of people I have never met. News organizations have their own priorities, and no one called to say, &#8220;Thanks for sending us this fascinating report, but it&rsquo;s just too hot to handle.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, other things were happening that suggest what decisions were being made in newsrooms. One was the release of a different report on crime by an organization called Violence Free Duluth, in Duluth, Minnesota. As we reported in the July &#8220;O Tempora&#8221; section, this group studied a year&rsquo;s worth of gun crimes in detail in an attempt to understand the connection between firearms and violence. They looked into such things as the type of gun used, the role of alcohol and drugs, the relationship between killer and victim, and the age, race, and sex of the criminals. In April, the group released its report, but left one thing out: race of perpetrator.</p>
<p>Frank Jewell, who heads the organization, said that minorities are perhaps just arrested more often than whites, and explained that &#8220;we didn&rsquo;t include it [the race data] because it might be misinterpreted.&#8221; Duluth&rsquo;s deputy police chief Robert Grytdahl agreed with this decision, saying that the race findings might distract whites from the real problem: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a comfortable place for white people to park the (gun crime) problem. It would be a huge distraction, and we wanted to focus on firearms.&#8221;</p>
<p>What are these people really saying? By claiming that information about race &#8220;might be misinterpreted,&#8221; Mr. Jewell is saying that the people of Duluth cannot be trusted with the truth  &mdash;  that they are either evil or stupid or both, and might draw unacceptable conclusions if they knew how much gun violence is committed by non-whites. He, of course, is a superior being and can be trusted with difficult truths.</p>
<p>Mr. Grytdahl is just as contemptible. According to the 1990 census, Duluth was 95 percent white. What if it turned out that virtually all the gun crimes in the city were committed by the other five percent? Is this what Mr. Grytdahl means by &#8220;a comfortable place for white people to park the problem,&#8221; whereas he wants to &#8220;focus on firearms&#8221;? Isn&rsquo;t he saying that if the truth got out someone might conclude that Duluth has a minority problem rather than a gun problem?</p>
<p>His views can be put this way. Let us imagine the dawn of the automobile age, and drivers are getting into lots of accidents  &mdash;  so many, in fact, that some people want to ban cars. A study finds that a large number of accidents are caused by drivers under age eighteen, and that the auto safety problem would be largely solved if young people were kept from behind the wheel. The anti-automobile forces might want to suppress that information. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a comfortable place for older people to park the problem,&#8221; they might say. &#8220;It would be a huge distraction and we wanted to focus on automobiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, Mr. Jewell and Mr. Grytdahl wanted a dishonest study. They knew in advance the conclusions they wanted it to reach and deliberately suppressed information that might lead to different conclusions. They are not doing research; they are practicing propaganda. They want to keep the people of Duluth ignorant, because it is easier to tell ignorant people what to think.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Nobody Knows&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Something similar but more subtle took place in the pages of the <cite>New York Times</cite> on July fourth. In a long, front-page story called &#8220;Reason is Sought for Lag by Blacks in School Effort,&#8221; reporter Pam Belluck wrote about the persistent racial gap in academic achievement. She wrote that educators are dismayed to find that white students from households with a family income of less than $10,000 a year get higher SAT scores than black students from households that make more than $70,000. After hearing various not-very-convincing explanations from teachers, students, parents and researchers, she concluded, &#8220;nobody claims to have clear answers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of people who have clear answers, and Miss Belluck knows the names of some of them. I telephoned her to ask why she had not explored the IQ argument, even if only to reject it. She became defensive, saying that her article &#8220;reflected everything that was told me.&#8221; When I asked if no one had mentioned a &#8220;bell curve&#8221;-type explanation for low black achievement, she said the purpose of the article was not to promote anyone&rsquo;s book. She quickly ended the conversation, saying &#8220;I&rsquo;m not here to be interviewed.&#8221; Miss Belluck could easily have expanded her story to include the only explanation that makes sense, but she choose not to. Today, if anyone tells you &#8220;no one has clear answers&#8221; to questions about racial gaps in achievement, he is either stupid or thinks you are stupid. Miss Belluck apparently thinks her readers are stupid.</p>
<p>To return to our report, <cite>The Color of Crime,</cite> is it possible that editors decided simply to suppress news that doesn&rsquo;t fit the vision of America they want us to embrace? Is it possible that like Frank Jewell in Duluth they think the truth about race and crime might be &#8220;misinterpreted&#8221;? Do they perhaps think that the less we know the easier it will be for them to tell us what to think?</p>
<p>The great irony is that we are told over and over that our form of government requires an informed electorate. Ignorant voters are irresponsible voters. And yet would it be going too far to suggest that some people prefer that voters be ignorant  &mdash;  at least about certain things  &mdash;  because if they were knowledgeable they might not vote the way they should? For people like Frank Jewell, who think that the rest of us are incapable of dealing responsibly with the truth, ignorant citizens are <em>better</em> citizens.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for those who decide for us what is worth knowing and what isn&rsquo;t, there are many new ways to get information. The Internet is one, and it is significant that it is only the left  &mdash;  and never the right  &mdash;  that worries about the political views available on the net. <em>No one</em> sees the Internet as a great propaganda opportunity for people who want big government, gun control, racial egalitarianism, radical feminism, homosexual rights, internationalism, and higher taxes. But if &#8220;hate mongers&#8221; can use the net to seduce young minds, why not socialists? The fact is, the left doesn&rsquo;t need the net because the big media are already in its hands. It fears the Internet because it is an uncontrollable alternative to the conventional media that already echo its views.</p>
<p>The people who run National Public Radio (NPR) recently got a slap on the wrist when investigators found that several big public radio stations had swapped donor lists with the Democrats. It is no mystery why they didn&rsquo;t swap with the Republicans (or with the New Century Foundation); the broadcasting network that is supposed to be &#8220;national&#8221; and &#8220;public,&#8221; and that receives support from the taxpayer is pitching the same pop socialism the Democrats do. And these are the same people who insist that the media are not liberal. Are they stupid or do they think we are stupid? That a Republican majority in Congress should continue to fund open leftists is just one more sign of its spinelessness.</p>
<p>But even if NPR is firmly in the hands of the left, radio can be a good, alternative news source. As we reported in the January issue, conservative talk radio can sometimes come close to being an exercise in real free speech. The limits are narrower than on the Internet but <em>much</em> broader than in the <cite>New York Times</cite> or <cite>Washington Post.</cite> And, indeed, conservative talk radio cannot get enough of <cite>The Color of Crime.</cite> Over the years I have spoken on hundreds of radio programs, but no other subject has ever caught the attention of hosts and listeners the way this one has. Never before have I so often been asked to stay on the program longer than scheduled. Never before have hosts asked me to come back on the air a week later because their callers are still talking about race and crime. Never before have I been on one radio station only to have a <em>competing</em> station in the same city invite me on because the subject caused such a stir.</p>
<p>I think I know why people like this subject. Although it is still semi-taboo to discuss crime rates and interracial crime in gruesome, factual detail, it is a subject that directly touches the lives of whites and one in which they can take an interest without being too explicitly &#8220;racial.&#8221; Slowly-awakening whites who cannot yet talk calmly about race and IQ or the legitimacy of maintaining a white majority can tuck right into the purely factual aspects of crime rates. This reflects a latent racial consciousness that can only develop over time.</p>
<p>Needless to say, some listeners don&rsquo;t want to hear that blacks commit murder and robbery at ten times the white rate. A surprising number of black callers insist we have a &#8220;racist&#8221; white government that cooks the statistics. Most white callers fall into one of two camps: those who say I am a &#8220;racist&#8221; and those who say I am brave. It is, of course, a sorry day in America when one is either brave or racist (somehow no one ever suggests I am both) simply for reporting crime statistics that the Department of Justice has been collecting for decades. There are two variants of the &#8220;racist&#8221; argument. One is that what I am saying just isn&rsquo;t true because the figure are false or I am lying. The other is that even if the figures are true, publicizing them will only give comfort to &#8220;racists&#8221; and feed stereotypes. This is basically the Frank Jewell argument: White people cannot be trusted with the truth, ignorance is better than knowledge, etc. This widespread combination of obscurantism and contempt for whites is the very essence of liberal thinking about race.</p>
<p>The larger point, however, is that thanks to talk radio, the Internet, the <cite>Washington Times,</cite> and a few alternative publications that have written about <cite>The Color of Crime,</cite> many people are finding out the facts  &mdash;  and they are well aware that they didn&rsquo;t read them in the morning paper. Many radio hosts exult in this: &#8220;And you didn&rsquo;t read about this in the <cite>Baltimore Sun,</cite> did you? That&rsquo;s right, folks, this is where you hear the news the papers are afraid to print.&#8221; Many callers are also openly contemptuous of the racial double standards the major media practice, and point out that if whites were committing a great deal of violence against blacks it would be front-page news. It is plain how little they trust television or newspapers.</p>
<p>Things cannot go on like this forever. The big media continue to close ranks over racial differences, immigration, the joys of &#8220;diversity,&#8221; gun control, etc., but fewer people believe them. Politicians and commentators continue to mouth the cliches the press feeds them, while more and more people stock up on ammunition and stop voting.</p>
<p>The country is moving in two directions at once. To someone who reads only the <cite>Washington Post,</cite> America is joyfully getting more liberal and multicultural all the time. President Clinton welcomes the day when whites become a minority. Immigration judges sagely decide that African women are refugees because they face genital mutilation back home. The Postal Service issues a stamp commemorating Malcolm X. New Hampshire does as it is told, and now every state celebrates Martin Luther King&rsquo;s birthday. Non-whites continue to pour into the country without the slightest sign Congress has noticed or cares.</p>
<p>At the same time, trust in government and voter participation are at all-time lows. Alternative publications that openly mock the mainstream are gaining circulation. Despite the boom-time economy, the country is in the grip of a sense of crisis and foreboding that has no equivalent in living memory. Probably not since the secession crisis of the previous century have a greater proportion of Americans worried so much about the future. And probably never before have so many citizens thought our rulers were such selfish, unscrupulous men promoting policies that are so obviously wrong.</p>
<p>One of the causes of this disaffection is the yawning gap in what Americans know to be true and what they see on the evening news. Politicians and newspaper editors will have to start edging towards the truth or risk losing yet more of their audience. They cannot go on forever ignoring facts that ever-larger numbers of Americans are learning in unconventional ways.</p>
<p>But they could go on for a long time. The Soviet Union dragged on for years after even the diehards ceased to believe the propaganda. What&rsquo;s more, the Soviet people had an important advantage in that the heavy, censoring hand of the commissar was clear for all to see. Everyone knew that it was the Communist Party that told them what to think, and anyone with a radio could tune into a different way of thinking.</p>
<p>Things are not so simple for us. There is no central censoring agency quite so obvious as the Communist Party, and there are no overseas radio broadcasts with a different point of view. American censorship is the worst, most cowardly kind: self-censorship. Every editor and television commentator knows what we are supposed to think, and dutifully curbs his tongue. At the same time, there is brisk public disagreement about subjects that are not central to the prevailing ideology, which gives the impression of freedom of expression.</p>
<p>AR and its readers are therefore subversives, whether we like it or not. When a social order is based on deception and hypocrisy, an honest man can be nothing else.</p>

		<p>People facing racial differences honestly is as likely to happen as people facing death honestly. Unfortunately, many people will just believe what ever makes them feel good over what is actually true and just like believing with zero evidence that there is an invisible protector living in the sky watching over you or that you can live after you die, people will continue to believe without any evidence that the races are equal because it makes many people feel good to embrace racial equality then add to that the peer pressure of being branded as an evil racist if you side with all the evidence on the subject, the facts of the matter become virtually irrelevant. This is not a matter of simply educating people and the realities of race differences will continue to be as stubbornly resisted as the fact that god is nothing more that a silly superstition. Very few people can truly be honest with themselves on matters like these.</p>

<p>I disagree with this argument, for I`m white, gay and proud. Not all gay people should be defamed and painted as leftists.  We are not the same.   </p>

		<p>Had the Color of Crime revealed that whites commit a disproportionate amount of crime the news organizations that requested a copy would have blared it on the front page.</p>
<p>Since it instead stated the truth the media suppressed it like Depression-era Pravda or the New York Times finding evidence of famine in the Ukraine.   </p>

When a social order is based on deception and hypocrisy, an honest man can be nothing else)* Two very good, perhaps irrefutable points&hellip; WHY should it be the case that it is only the LEFT that is ever so concerned about  the lack of CENSORSHIP on the internet&hellip;??? The left is always saying that information and education are the best means towards a better more just world&hellip;.SO why are they not content to refute what they find inaccurate on the net with contrary argument?&hellip; Do they doubt in the publics ability to weigh the evidence judiciously&hellip;??? Or in their own ability to articulate a point&hellip;???  Secondly, Amrenners being subversives is a sad reality,&hellip;.a reality that I hope we that honor free speech and our constitution take very seriously *</p>

		<p>I believe that the reason we don&rsquo;t hear honest reporting or statistics involving which races commit how much crime - is fear.  SOMEBODY out there, who has clout, is threatening reporters, editors, publishers, you name it - with either job loss or even death if they publish certain embarrassing stats and facts.  It may be the marxist Mafia, or the Obama Mafia - I really don&rsquo;t know who.  However, I am certain that there are very real and dangerous threats being made to the right people in the media, and since they want to retain their jobs and their lives, they comply.  Certainly some want to support the leftists.  But those who don&rsquo;t are forced to anyway.  Somebody needs to get behind it and find out what&rsquo;s really going on here.</p>

		<p>The problem with getting people to face facts about race and crime is that people just really don&rsquo;t believe that blacks are more criminal than whites.  To some extent, I can see why.</p>
<p>While black thugs mug people, whites like Bernie Madoff create ponzi schemes and steal people&rsquo;s life savings.  The way they see it, whites have all the power and privilege, therefore their crimes are more genteel.  That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re called &#8220;white collar criminals&#8221;.  </p>
<p>As to violent crime, the liberals always point to pedophile perverts and serial murderers, who tend to be more white.  They also point to corporate insiders who knowingly disregard product safety hazards for profit, sometimes resulting in many deaths.  They see this as equivalent to street murder, and generally a white problem.  Whites also are seen as starting wars, resulting in violent deaths by the thousands.  In their view, wars can never be justified, and stated goals are always seen as pretexts for some other, sinister motive involving greed and oppression of others.  People who believe in global warming see white-led corporations creating untold misery among the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable by creating environmental messes that they do not want to clean up.</p>
<p>Their basic argument is that the race with the power doesn&rsquo;t need to engage in street crime, only the powerless do.  I&rsquo;m not saying I agree with any of this, but I must say I find these arguments difficult to refute.</p>
<p>And it is true that Wall Street greed nearly destroyed this country.  They have a point there.  We here at Amren expect other races to acknowledge their shortcomings.  Will we acknowledge ours?</p>
<p>Certainly, I would rather live in a world with Bernie Madoffs than with, say, those who perpetrated the Knoxville Horrors.  Still, the point is that liberals believe they are on firm footing when they deny that blacks are more criminal than whites.  I really do not know of any cogent response to these arguments.  Until we address these arguments, these statistics will not persuade anyone.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s your cogent response:  Bernie Madoff, Halliburton and global (not) warming can&rsquo;t rob or rape or murder you on your way from your job to you car in the garage at night.

		<p>#7 Sofita .. No doubt honest people must hold themselves to the light of truth and take a good look at their own negative contributions that have come back to haunt them. Anyone that in their own eyes is above listening to criticism is clearly above and beyond my ability to respect them. The Old Testament, Genesis is very early on demonstrating the different strata of people created by the varying quality or lack of quality choices the different branches of humanity took. The repercussions were not lost to those who took the higher roads, as well the lower. (Sowing and reaping,..Karma) The subject concerning individual and or group karma, in my opinion cannot be honestly applied to the different races.. carte blanche, as I see it though,&hellip;I don&rsquo;t believe any race has more dignity than any other. We have seen highs and lows in every complexion. In fact the brutality between different segments of humanity are always unfortunate to me regardless of human type. My desire is to promote an honest discussion concerning the races so as to have promoted the most reasonable fate of the Euro culture and  others. As I believe reason has been impinged upon by an excess of emotion in the PC culture in order to unjustly steal from the white culture what it has honestly labored for,..as well as to steal the white genes via coerced miscegenation.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think thats good enough.  What your saying certainly proves that you have to look out for yourself whenever blacks may be around, but it doesn&rsquo;t show that blacks are more criminal than whites.  Only that they&rsquo;re criminal in a different way.  That is the whole problem with the premise of this article, that if only people knew and faced the truth about black criminality they&rsquo;d be pro-white.  What I&rsquo;m saying is that they do know the statistics, and the statistics lead them to believe that there is no difference in criminality between the races.  If whites were poor and powerless, they&rsquo;d mug, rob, rape and murder just as blacks do, and this criminal potential is demonstrated in the likes of Bernie Madoff, etc.</p>
<p>Your argument will not persuade liberals.</p>

		<p>7 Sofita: White collar criminals are a much smaller proportion of the White population than violent thugs are of the Black population.  Will one third of White men go to jail in their lives?  <br>
     The fact is, Blacks commit much more criminal fraud per capita than Whites, but it is committed against other Blacks and for small amounts.  It&rsquo;s simply not newsworthy.  The rich Whites who lost money to Madoff would never have trusted a Black with that money, because their instincts tell them not to.  <br>
     I also doubt that Whites are more likely to be pedophiles or serial killers than Blacks.  First, any demographic group that commits homicide at 11 times the White rate is unlikely to be surpassed in any other sociopathic category either.  That tells you that any apparent White predominance in criminality needs to be looked at closely.  Take serial killing.  What does a homicidal White do to fulfill his destiny?  He carefully plans his attacks, because if he didn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d not be on the street long enough to be a serial killer.  He works almost always alone, because finding like-minded Whites is hard to to.  He attacks Whites because they are near by, familiar, more trusting, and altogether easier prey.  He is newsworthy because his victims usually have family or friends who notice when they go missing.  The police will catch on that there&rsquo;s a serial killer around because this guy is working alone and his crimes will have common characteristics.  But how does the homicidal Black carry out his work?  He joins a gang.  His serial killings are just &#8220;gang related&#8221; shootings.  If he wants to do a little free lance work, he shoots some druggies or prostitutes in a alley.  Those murders are just counted as drug deals gone bad.  The Black serial killer lives in a sea of violence, where his efforts stand out no more than spit in a bucket of soapy water.  <br>
     The idea that Whites commit a disproportionate share of child molestation is similarly dealt with.  Among a race where bastardy is the norm, and girls are typically sexually active before entering high school, you have to stoop really low to be considered a molester.  A White man who has sex with a 12 year old is a monster, a Black man is&hellip;a Black man.  Momma is not going to go to the cops because &#8220;uncle&#8221; Willie or her newest baby daddy has got little Shamika pregnant too.<br>
     I could go on to the other accusations of White malevolence, but this is long enough.  Let your liberals account for Black criminality, and the much lower criminality of poor, powerless Whites, before they go off topic and start blathering about Whites starting wars or polluting the world.  War and pollution are real topics, but are deliberate distractions from the issue of Blacks.</p>

		<p>Sofita, when blacks are in positions of management they commit white collar crimes at least as often as white people do.  Certainly the corruption in cities with black government is as bad as you&rsquo;ll find anywhere.  If a majority of white collar criminals are white that&rsquo;s simply because the vast majority of people in a management position are white.<br>

		<p>Robert, you need to correlate the two that you seem to despise.  You need to spend time reading the blogs Spirit Water Blood and Cambria will not fall in addition to this blog.  The REASON egalitarianism and racial pollution has become acceptable is because people have abandoned the God who made the races, and defined suitable purposes FOR the races.  I am not speaking of Aryan Nations type &#8220;christianity&#8221; either.  I am speaking of the true bible and true Christianity as our ancestors believed.  While condemning what is happening in our once White Christian society, you miss the entire point on HOW it has happened.  First, they removed God.  THEN they were able to substitute a new theology - the theologies of the black man, the theologies of the Social Justice Marxists, the theologies of egalitarianism and relative morality.  </p>

<p>If that won&rsquo;t work, then bring up Frankin Raines, Rwanda, and pull up and print out a list of black serial killers (I&rsquo;m sure there are several on the web).  The only reason serial killing &#8220;seems&#8221; to be a white crime is that it&rsquo;s one of the few types of violent felonies that blacks aren&rsquo;t very disproportionately committing, even though the universe of serial killers among blacks and whites matches their percentages in the general population.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this often-touted religious theory were correct-that a turning away from God is at the root of all societal ills-then we would expect to find the least religious nations on earth to be bastions of crime, poverty, and disease and the most religious nations to be models of societal health. A comparison of highly irreligious countries with highly religious countries, however, reveals a very different state of affairs. In reality, the most secular countries-those with the highest proportion of atheists are among the most stable, peaceful, free, wealthy, and healthy societies. And the most religious nations-wherein worship of God is in abundance-are among the most unstable, violent, oppressive, poor, and destitute.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Robert, the very article you linked to says this: &#8220;The information presented in this discussion in no way proves that high levels of organic atheism cause societal health or that low levels of organic atheism cause societal ills such as poverty or illiteracy. The wealth, poverty, well-being, and suffering in various nations are caused by numerous political, historical, economic, and sociological factors that are far more determinant than people&rsquo;s personal belief systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I have observed, Blacks (and Hispanics) have a high level of religiosity, but a low level of spirituality (honesty, faith, real faith, not just Sunday morning faith, integrity, etc.) Whites with faith tend to &#8220;live&#8221; their faith much more that non-whites.  </p>
<p>And comparing White Western atheists, with all the creature comforts in the world to keep them passive, to some semi-barbarian Muslim in Pakistan is not really great proof of the efficacy of atheism vs. belief in &#8220;god&#8221; (whoever and whatever that &#8220;god&#8221;, little &#8220;g&#8221;, is). Come to mentioned it - Islam - I believe it is nothing more that the most EVIL force of &#8220;religion&#8221; on earth. With that, we might agree.</p>

		<p>It has been probably a couple of years since I last posted, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why, but have remained a loyal reader always.  I want to comment on the thread that Sofita started about refuting liberal arguments.  I am a reformed psuedo-liberal, I use this label because I never called myself a liberal, but in recent years upon my &#8220;awakening&#8221; through a lot of direct, very negative experience with multi-culturalism, I have realized that although I may not have called myself liberal, I was.  I say this because I was one that used the exact arguments that Sofita is identifing and used them very well, and now I argue the exact opposite even better, as I already know, often better than my adversary, what will be said next.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Sofita if you really know minority culture, specifically black, on a first hand basis, but Schoolteacher does a pretty good job putting it down here.  Being an ex-liberal, I have been completely immersed in black and latino culture, even spending years in a black country, black neighborhoods here, becoming highly fluent in Spanish, and I even have a mulatto daughter who is seven and lives abroad (very, very tough situation, that is for another post, I know so, so well the terrible effects of miscegention), I can tell you that Schoolteacher is only touching the tip of the iceburg, you have no idea how completely patholgical black culture is, things that pass for norms or that are even admired in their culture would horrify you if you truly knew.  Yes, there is corruption in white culture, in all cultures, but an advanced society still functions and flourishes. Furthermore, the super greed and corruption that are mentioned in our culture are of this generation, and can be traced back as having the implementation of multi-culturism/progressivness as a very large contributing factor.  Read Robert Bork&rsquo;s &#8220;Slouching Towards Gomorrah&#8221; to get a good take on the history of this.  I don&rsquo;t think anyone here on Amren would disagree that the current left ideology is very much a game of &#8220;lets pretend&#8221; so we can all feel good. If one can&rsquo;t see the corelation between this and the general movement that started in the 60s,(and civil rights) progressed to the Clintons, and meanwhile spread like a cancer into our financial sector, higher education and all the pillars of our society, one is not seeing the whole picture.  The whole justification of poor minority behavior is only possible with moral relativism as a cornerstone, and moral relativism is what creates corruption.  </p>
<p>As for whites causing war, war has always been and probably will always be.  I am not for it, but I don&rsquo;t delude myself about the true intentions of many men, no matter what color, and power and greed are human conditions.  At least white wars stop and there is usually great progression in their wake.  And how much has multi-culturalism played a part in the cause of war itself?  Probably significantly.  In the hood it is constant warfare, urban, low intensity, but never ending. Africa seems to have been at war since its inception, and for being with limited resources, the brutality is amazing.  Read about the Congo in recent years and remember Rwanda</p>
<p>The argument that blacks behave so badly is because they are poor is complete hogwash.  There are no poor in this country.  Go to the third world where 70% of the world&rsquo;s population lives to see poverty.  Go to the hood, spend some time, see the line-up of cars at the local rim shop each day where it costs $500 for one rim.  Price guns and see how much they are and find out how many thugs have several.  Gander past the open doors of the apartments and see the big screen TVs, playstations, stereos, bags of weed, 40 oz liquor bottles, $100 sneakers, etc. ad nauseum.  If blacks are forced to this behavior by a wicked white society, think of this.  They want nothing more than to be rid of us or rise above, right?  That is what they claim. So why, after 40 years at least of hard core gang-banging and afirmative action haven&rsquo;t they taken the millions of dollars, probably billions, and built businesses and communities so they never have to see or deal with the wicked whites again?  Actually, their situation is getting worse and worse.  The answer is obvious. Moral fabric of the culture.  The Japanese were completely distroyed after WW2 and with a bit of help, in 30 years they were a world economic power.  Look at their values. They went to work with humility, something the vast majority of blacks seem incapable of doing.</p>
<p>And this brings me to my final points of Robert and Bill.  Bill is absolutely right, and what he is talking about is not the pretense of God, going to church and saying &#8220;God bless you&#8221; to everyone, he is talking about a true reverance and respect for the Christian God that is taught by sincerely studying christian scripture and practising it daily in what you do.  I have only recently become aware of how deeply ingrained these values were in our society, that almost every good law that we had (some we still do), can be traced back to the Bible.  Most don&rsquo;t understand this at all, as I didn&rsquo;t, but property rights, respect for authority, fair trials, respect for elders, discipline for children, honesty, humility, all are Christian doctrines.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean that you must be a Christian to believe in these things, but there is no doubt that they were woven into the fabric of our society by our forefathers who were devout believers for the faithful and secular both to benefit from. They were also tempered with a strong sense of service, duty and compassion, uniquely Christian values among the powerful. To say that secular societies are better off than religious doesn&rsquo;t do the issue justice.  Are we talking about Islamic societies as an example of religious? They are not Christian and only mouth the words of piety, but practice little reverance for God in general. Maybe latin American Catholics? All talk, no action. Is Europe the example of secular?  Try to find a place on earth with more Christian heritage than Europe, it is not secular, maybe in practice by most today, but not in inherited structure, not by far.  Japan has been a great success in the last century and who do they immulate? The Christian west.  The whole world immulates the Christian west, or tries.  Those with sincerity do well, the fakes do not. If we had continued with a God fearing attitude (I think of my grandparents where things just were right, that was it, no dicussion, not even mention of God or why), we never, never could have gotten into this mess in the first place. But take away God, take away the standard, and what is the new standard?  Feelings.  Welcome to modern liberalism.<br>

<p>I agree with your point about moral relativism, but as far as &#8216;justification of poor minority behavior&rsquo;&hellip; the behavior of non-whites is blamed on whites, racists and white society, and the &#8216;arch conservatives&rsquo; who usually object to this, whites as scapegoats, are usually fingered as racists. Jared Taylor claimed it is sort of a straight jacket of sorts because liberals don&rsquo;t want to be seen as the racists. Yet the masses of society are tired of feeling guilty and want escape from it. </p>
<p>As far as your end discussion about &#8216;feelings&rsquo;&hellip; for one&hellip; I believe it&rsquo;s time whites get in touch with theirs. Because no matter how happy-feeling modern liberalism claims to be, it seems desperate to deny the idea that whites may have feelings of their own, and desperate to suppress their expression. Respect for &#8216;feelings&rsquo; is reserved only for protected groups and indeed for the only ones who are really considered people. </p>

<p>What you don&rsquo;t understand is that Christianity doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from signing up after you&rsquo;ve made poor choices.  Indeed, churches are filled with people who made bad choices.  In many cases, people become Christians after realizing that following along with the permissive values of secular society has brought then nothing but trouble.  </p>
<p>In the old days, people followed Christianity because of tradition and social pressure.  Those have now broken down.  People now are stubborn and disobedient.  They insist on learning everything the hard way.  They come to God only after ruining, or at least significantly complicating, their lives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that religion is the only story.  I don&rsquo;t think it is.  I think blacks have challenges that cannot be explained by culture alone.  But if you deny that blacks, even with their innate challenges, functioned signficantly better before the Cultural Revolution of the 1960&rsquo;s, you are just as reality-challenged as egalitarian liberals.<br>
