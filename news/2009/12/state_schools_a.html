			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Clark, Daily Mail (London), December 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As many as three-quarters of state schools are failing to push their brightest pupils because teachers are reluctant to promote &#8216;elitism&rsquo;, an Ofsted study says today.</p>
<p>Many teachers are not convinced of the importance of providing more challenging tasks for their gifted and talented pupils.</p>
<p>Bright youngsters told inspectors they were forced to ask for harder work. Others were resentful at being dragooned into &#8216;mentoring&rsquo; weaker pupils.</p>
<p>In nearly three-quarters of 26 schools studied, pupils designated as being academically gifted or talented in sport or the arts were &#8216;not a priority&rsquo;, Ofsted found.</p>
<p>Teachers feared that a focus on the brightest pupils would &#8216;undermine the school&rsquo;s efforts to improve the attainment and progress of all other groups of pupils&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Head teachers told inspectors that ministers had failed to give a strong enough signal that catering for gifted pupils should be central to schools&rsquo; work.</p>
<p>Schools are meant to identify the top 5 to 10 per cent of pupils as &#8216;gifted and talented&rsquo; and ensure they are given appropriate tasks to help them achieve their potential.</p>
<p>By September 2010, such pupils should expect to receive written confirmation from their school of the extra activities and master-classes they will benefit from.</p>
<p>The schools in the study, 17 secondary and nine primary, were chosen because they had been told to improve provision for gifted pupils.</p>
<p>Previous studies have pointed to a widespread ideological reluctance in schools and local authorities to champion academic excellence.</p>
<p>A separate study has called for the introduction of academic selection at the age of 13 or 14 to identify pupils who excel at science.</p>
<p>The study, by Professor Alan Smithers and Dr Pamela Robinson of Buckingham University, said it was &#8216;a nonsense&rsquo; that specialist science schools were barred from selecting pupils according to their ability in science.<br>

		<p>Is &#8220;state school&#8221; Brit parlance for anything other than its literal meaning?  I know that when I read &#8220;public school&#8221; in the Brit papers, that I should interpret it to mean an expensive private school, as I would think of it.</p>

		<p>When I first started working in public school, I noticed the big philosophy of &#8220;inclusion&#8221; classrooms.  The idea is that the genius kid must sit next to the absolute retard who is four grade levels behind, with everyone else, including convicted felons, in between.  (I had two 17 year old 9th graders who had parole officers!)  </p>
<p>After one year spent &#8220;differentiating&#8221; my instruction (which is basically giving a lot of posterboard projects so everyone can play a &#8220;role&#8221; in the projects, I asked my assistant principal if we could start an AP class for the more middle of the road and advanced students, who were sullen and despondent for, yes, getting conscripted to help the emotionally disturbed and/or borderline retarded students.  </p>
<p>My supervisor was aghast and - I&rsquo;m not making this up - she was indignant at the thought that some students would have more advantages than other.  She shot my proposal down with a look that said if I ever suggested anything like that again she would hound me out of the school under a flurry of &#8220;unsatisfactory&#8221; ratings.  </p>
<p>Folks, don&rsquo;t blame all the teachers for the problems in the schools.  In my experience, only about 10% of them are dyed-in-the-wool &#8220;progressives.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s the supervisors and the district administrations who are constantly putting into place policies that are just plain, well - &#8220;daft.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is critical for our nation to focus on our very brightest students.  Our economy and well-being run on scientific and technical breakthroughs, virtually all of which are made by the very brightest among us.  </p>
<p>High-IQ students must be identified early (by 3rd grade), and provided high-quality accelerated education.  Our nation is greatly harmed by the current educational fad of placing high-IQ and low-IQ students in the same classroom.  It slows down or even destroys the smart students, and only frustrates the dumb students.  </p>

		<p>To the extent educators in Britain resembles their counterparts in the U. S., they have severely limited capacity to address the needs of gifted students   &mdash;  - EVEN if they wanted to do so, which, for ideological reasons, many do not.</p>
<p>That is because the education field attracts the lowest functioning adults with college degrees.  This is readily verified by scanning Graduate Record Examination (GRE) data supplied by the Educational Testing Service.</p>
<p>In fact a letter in the Wall Street Journal supplies details.  Quoting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Applicants for graduate study in education administration  &mdash;  tested between July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2004  &mdash;  had a combined mean total GRE (Graduate Record Examination) score of 950 (Verbal, 427; Math, 523). That is sixth from the bottom of 51 fields of graduate study tabulated by the Educational Testing Service.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mean total GRE score across all fields was 1066. Which applicants had still lower total GRE scores than applicants in education administration? Social work, 896; early childhood, 913; student counseling, 928; home economics, 933; special education, 934  &mdash;  education fields all. Other fields with mean GRE scores on the far left side of the GRE bell curve? Seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th from the left tip of the curve, respectively: public administration (&#8220;practices and roles of public bureaucracies&#8221;), 965; other education, 968; elementary education, 970; education evaluation and research, 985; other social science, 993. Note the pattern: Eighty-plus percent on the far-left-side-of-the-GRE-bell-curve are headed for  &mdash;  or, more likely, already employed by  &mdash;  public education systems. Ninety-plus percent are headed for some form of government employment. This GRE snapshot of the capabilities of the people who run government schooling monopolies is not unrelievedly bleak: There is one education &#8216;outlier,&rsquo; secondary education, that has a mean score of 1063, in the middle of the bell curve distribution.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is pretty much what I would expect from the left wing intellectual lightweights that tend to be attracted to government school employment.  I know that Great Britain is even more statist than the United States, so could someone from Great Britain answer this for me   &mdash;   how feasible is it to home school your kids in the U.K.?  Do you inevitably get dragged off by government goons if you try?<br>

<p>This is laughably sad.</p>
<p>We often make comparisons on this website to the work of George Orwell and the multicultural insanity that is destroying our civilization. Here however, it seems we might be heading more toward the year 2081 and the &ldquo;Harrison Bergeron&rdquo; world depicted by Kurt Vonnegut, than to Winston Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;1984&rdquo; nightmare society. </p>

		<p>The UK isn&rsquo;t goin to be satisfied until the whole white citizenry is noting but a bunch of mindless drones. So sad. <br>
With all the third world invaders pouring into that country, if the best and the brightest aren&rsquo;t allowed to accelerate, who is going to be there to take care of the third world detrius? Now don&rsquo;t in anyway take that comment I just made that I believe the Native Born White Brits should take care of these thrash heaps. It&rsquo;s just a rhetorical question. I wish someone would ask these &#8220;Labour&#8221; idiots this question in a serious public forum<br>
Do these libtards think about this? When they oppress and wipe out all the constructive, contributing peoples, are these gated community, sheltered, rich white liberals pick up the slack? HMMM&hellip;<br>
Who will be paying the taxesfor these masses? Who will take care of them? (again rhetorical) The UK and the USA for that matter will look like Somalia soon. Let them all starve.</p>

<p>You could be right, that could be what is really behind it all, but in the more immediate present, we have a population in terminal fear of being seen &#8216;politically incorrect&rsquo;. At least it&rsquo;s a bigger fear than a fear of being stupid. <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget the parent here in Canada who told me their very bright daughter wasn&rsquo;t given challenging tasks because the teacher was too busy with immigrant students who weren&rsquo;t competant in English.</p>

<p>Had these same schools been told to provide special things for muslims or &#8220;people of color&#8221; it would be done already!! and as to the other note, it would appear that the government would have science schools have &#8220;students&#8221; who excell as such subjects as &#8220;African American Studies&#8221; and such instead of hard sciences.</p>

		<p>Britain is the only country in the western World in which state education is a political football, rather than having the best interests of children at heart.<br>
 The rot started when the Labour Party in the 1960s introduced mixed-ability non-selective &#8216;comprehensive schools&rsquo;. The idea behind comprehensive schools was to promote social engineering of the British population by forcing different &#8216;social classes&rsquo; into the same classroom.<br>
 Educating children was only a secondary consideration.</p>

		<p>speaking from experience, gifted students in the US are treated like criminals, an embarrassment, misfits, mental patients.</p>
<p>the stats above on the intellectual quality (lack thereof) of educators explains a lot:</p>
<p>but the larger issue is indeed the &#8220;Harisson Bergeron syndrome&#8221; (how long before that grat story is banned from school libraries for its &#8220;fascism&#8221;??): <br>
a society so downward oriented, so concerned with the sensitivities of thugs &amp; morons that it hangs its future ben franklins and jeffersons out to dry.</p>
<p>as things stand, schools are the wrong place for gifted young people, but there are no good alternatives (unles you happen to be born rich).<br>

		<p>@WR, here in the UK it is lawful to home-educate but the authorities don&rsquo;t like it. If you want to do it the best advice is (a) never register your child with a school so they don&rsquo;t know he or she is missing, and (b) join up with other home-educators and form your own home-school and support group.</p>
<p>If a child is registered with a school and skips school too often a parent can be prosecuted and is sometimes sent to prison (for a few days.) So far it has always been the mother sent to jail because the father has always been absent.</p>
<p>There have also been quite a few prosecutions where parents have given a false address to get their child into a better school, eg a relative or friend&rsquo;s address. Local education authorities employ investigators to check out cases where there is some suspicion. (If you&rsquo;ve got the money this can be done lawfully by renting a house in a good area for the few months when school allocation is being made  &mdash;  generally they don&rsquo;t kick a child out once he or she has started if the family moves but still wants to use the same school. Buying a house in a good area can cost 50% more than a few feet over the dividing line. There are other ways of swinging the school you want; it&rsquo;s a whole black art.)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to speculate that the reason that the elites are so hostile to these bright kids is that they are from the lower classes.  The new Leftist elites are as class conscious as the old aristocracy, and they don&rsquo;t wish to see their class enemies, White working people, strengthened.  Can&rsquo;t have somebody with a clear idea of what multi-culturalism really means getting into power, can we?  <br>

		<p>I know that the British prefer US, Canada, Australia or other former British colonies when it comes to emigration, Eastern Europe countries are maybe poorer but when there are no other options such a country should be considered.</p>

		<p>I work in a school where teachers have classes of ten or fewer students. There is a modern computer lab  &mdash;  installed 2009. <br>
Some musical instruments are available. The PE classes involve kayaking, mountain biking, rock climbing etc. All teachers meet together for an hour every afternoon to discuss student progress. </p>
<p>Sounds like a dream, right? This is not a school for gifted and talented students. It&rsquo;s the local thug dump  &mdash;  an &#8220;alternative&#8221; school.</p>
