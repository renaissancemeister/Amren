<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ethnic pride may be as important as self-esteem to the mental health of young African-American adolescents, according to a new study in the Nov/Dec issue of the journal Child Development.</p>
<p>The empirical study is one of the first to look at the effects of self-esteem and of racial identity and to separately explore their effects by gender. The study specifically measures racial identity in terms of ethnic pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings indicate that  &mdash;  regardless of self-esteem  &mdash;  as feelings of ethnic pride go up, mental health tends to increase as well,&#8221; said psychologist Jelani Mandara, associate professor at Northwestern University School of Education and Social Policy. {snip}</p>
<p>Mandara is co-author with Maryse H. Richards and Noni Gaylord-Harden (Loyola University Chicago) and Brian Ragsdale (Walden University) of &#8220;The Effects of Changes in Racial Identity and Self-Esteem on Changes in African American Adolescents&rsquo; Mental Health.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new study speaks to the importance of ethnic pride separate and apart from self-esteem. &#8220;Psychologists have been theorizing about this for years,&#8221; Mandara said. &#8220;Our empirical evidence indicates that we&rsquo;ll see African-American teens with fewer depressive symptoms if we pay more attention to building ethnic pride.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to build ethnic pride than it is to influence self-esteem, he added.</p>

<p>Rubbish and nonsense.  One of the greatest problems among blacks is their arrogance and the perverted sense that they are superior in every way.  They have an image problem all right, but it&rsquo;s an egomaniacal one.  Most of them delusionally see themselves as great kings and queens.</p>
<p>Black mental problems are not problems at all within their race.  What we consider mental problems, blacks consider to be normal.</p>

		<p>With as much self-esteem and racial pride as they are taught, black teenage boys ought to be the most mentally stable group of people on Earth.  Except if they commit a crime, especially murder, then all of a sudden they&rsquo;ll be crazier than a loon such that they shouldn&rsquo;t to go prison or receive the death penalty.</p>

		<p>Racial pride is a false pride for one does nothing at all to achieve their race. True pride (and good self-esteem) comes from accomplishment and from being an ethical person. People who tend to focus on racial pride are generally people who lack the accomplishments and behaviors necessary to give themselves genuine pride.</p>

<p>How could that be because when one looks to the black race in comparison to the other races there isn&rsquo;t very much to be proud of. </p>

<p>Does it follow that ethnic pride would promote good mental health in White adolescents or is that not a concern?</p>

		<p>I work with a group called Resisting Defamation (now 19 years old) which advocates that young diverse white American children have a right to a decent sense of self-respect, i.e., no slurs (like &#8220;acting white&#8221;) and no negative stereotypes (like &#8220;typical white person&#8221;).</p>
<p>Acting white is a slur because it includes the assumption that there is no diversity among white children, and &#8220;typical white person&#8221; is a negative stereotype because it claims there is no diversity among any of the white peoples&hellip;who are the most internally diverse of any of the major demographic groups.</p>
<p>Pride in one&rsquo;s race is strange &amp; unearned, but everyone has the right to a decent sense of self-respect.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s my observation that, if anything, blacks have too much ethnic pride as it is, that&rsquo;s part of their problem. It&rsquo;s the White youth that&rsquo;s desperately in need of ethnic pride. I have yet to see any program where a study is done to see how it will affect White youths </p>

		<p>Two students show up at school.  The African has a red/green/black shirt with Malcolm X quotes on it.  The White has a Condeferate beltbuckle. </p>
<p>Funny that when Whites show pride in their race&rsquo;s accomplishments it&rsquo;s called racism and severely proscribed.</p>
<p>When Africans do so, it&rsquo;s labelled &#8216;ethnic pride&rsquo; and to be celebrated.</p>

		<p>It is absolutely moral and right to take pride in your race.  Just as it is moral and right to take pride in your family.  People are NOT atomized individuals, they are parts of a much vaster, and much more sublime, whole.  If people could only take pride in themselves, then they would never get past Robinson Crusoe level survival.  EVERYONE RELIES ON OTHERS TO ACHIEVE WHAT THEY DO.</p>
<p>Can a worker take pride in a product no one buys?  Can a soldier take pride in protecting nothing?  Can a doctor take pride in curing no one?  The existence of other people is a precondition for 99% of the good we do in the world.  Without them, what are we proud about?  If you are a businessman you rely on your workers, your customers, and thousands of other businesses up and down the supply chain.  To claim that you produce, single-handedly, a car, or an airplane, is absurd.  You can only take pride in .0001% of the finished product.</p>
<p>However, if you consider yourself, (correctly) a part of a group, you can identify with said group, and take pride in its collective accomplishments.  As a corporation, you can take pride in your product.  As a parent, you can take pride in your child.  As a white, you can take pride in your race.</p>
<p>What did you do to deserve the borrowed light of your group?  Simple, you loved and supported said group.  By loving it, you made it happier.  By supporting it, you made it stronger.  In both cases, you made it more able to achieve what it did.</p>
<p>Furthermore, collective pride is fair for another reason: We are all baskets of probability.  For one Newton to be born, tens of millions of whites must bear children and raise them well in the hopes of producing a Newton.  Why should Newton get the entire credit for the efforts of millions of families, across thousands of generations, trying over and over again to hit the jackpot of genes that is Newton?  Obviously everyone who participated in the effort of Newton creation, deserves as much credit as Newton, who was simply the lucky winner.  Newton exists only in the context of a white culture he didn&rsquo;t produce, and a white genome he didn&rsquo;t produce.  Every single person who ever contributed to, or was part of, that cultural and genetic matrix, should take pride in Newton&rsquo;s existence, because they are as much a part of Newton&rsquo;s achievement as he is.  He could not have done it without everyone else.  If you realize that every generation carries with it a sacred trust to preserve and enrich our cultural and genetic heritage, passing it on to the next generation being our primary duty and greatest achievement possible in life, why can&rsquo;t you take pride in the fact that you have done so?  That newton&rsquo;s genes and newton&rsquo;s discoveries live on in you, and in your kids, and in your grandkids, is the only reason Newton achieved anything.  Without us, what was Newton worth?  Just a flash in the pan, 50 years come and gone.  But in us, he can be immortal.  Isn&rsquo;t that worth something?</p>
<p>To be honest, I have no idea why you would even post on Amren, if you don&rsquo;t take pride in your race.  If you have no pride in your race, if you feel no attachment to your race, if you think you, and your race, have nothing to do with each other   &mdash;   then why would you possibly care what happens to it?</p>

		<p>From the original article:</p>
<p>&#8220;These children are bombarded with negative images of African Americans in the media,&#8221; Mandara said. &#8220;They need exposure to African Americans who are doing well to minimize the derogatory images they see.&#8221;</p>
<p>One wonders what alternate universe Mandara lives in.  While blacks are sometimes portrayed as villains, they are almost always complex characters.  White villains (who are much more common) are typically hollow stereotypes.  More often than not, blacks are shown as scientists, selfless heroes or the ultimate manly image.  Either that or they are shown as victims of white racism - and image that is reinforced by schools and other government propaganda.</p>

		<p>This article is a steaming pile of dog poo. Every bit of literature I have ever seen shows that blacks are high in self esteem. Interestingly, asians, who, in general, have a high level of achievement, typically have low self esteem. (Think Charlie Chan, being very humble as some sort of a stereotype). What blacks need is a sense of self worth, which is much more valuable than is self esteem. This requires effort like hard work, honesty, stability, strong family and all that old middle class ethic. </p>

<p>When my father achieves something or does something especially well, I am proud of him, and proud to be his son.</p>
<p>Because I am his son. That is enough. I did nothing to achieve that status and cannot. Indeed, I also cannot lose that status.</p>

<p>Your assertion is wrong.</p>
<p>Blacks, with and average IQ of 85, are neither intelligent enough nor organized enough to &#8216;take over the US.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Blacks do not control the US, although it may appear to you that way.  Their path to power was cleared entirely by a small,powerful, wealthy hostile elite that hides behind blacks and other non-Whites.  The hostile elites have effectively neutered Whites for decades now via the government, media and academia.</p>
<p>Blacks are a perfect foil for them:  If there is a disaster or when the economy fails who do you think will take the blame?  obama and his minions will despite having little to no understanding of foreign policy or economics, certainly not the true power brokers.  Non-whites have also been made criticism-proof  &mdash;  if a White deigns to criticize a black president or government official, he is axiomatically branded as a hateful racist, effectively ending any and all complaints and his job and reputation will be threatened as well if he doesn&rsquo;t shut up immediately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant plan  &mdash;  stifle Whites completely via Hate Speech and/or other threats, tax the h*** out of them to strip them of their wealth and property, control the media and academia and spread the message that Whites are crime-prone and psychotic and their ultimate goal is to foment a Fourth Reich if not held in check via government controls. Lastly they&rsquo;ve opened the floodgates to White homelands, inviting in hoards of hostile, parasite non-Whites from the Third World.  </p>
<p>Blacks had NOTHING to do with White destruction and have NO idea of what is going on.</p>
<p>Do not give blacks credit for anything, for creating anything, for &#8216;taking over anything from Whites.&rsquo;  Those with average IQs of 85 and a propensity for violence and mayhem are not capable of running any First World, technologically dominated civilizations.</p>
<p>Look to ANY country or city run by blacks for an example  &mdash;  Detroit, Zim, etc.  &mdash;  they can&rsquo;t even run their own countries when billions of dollars are showered on them by Whites and technological inventions are handed to them.</p>

		<p>This article is just another example of the liberal mindset trying to find another excuse for black failure. These same liberals will do whatever they can to destroy White pride in an effort to minimize the accomplishments of Whites. When that doesn&rsquo;t work, they will continue to grope at straws to explain the dismal &#8220;accomplishments&#8221; or lack of in blacks.</p>
<p>Install all the ethnic pride you want in blacks and they will still be failures even in their own continent of Africa. Unfortunately, the liberals will continue to look for more excuses to explain why blacks are always &#8220;left behind.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I see nothing at all to suggest blacks are lacking in either ethnic or racial pride or in self-esteem. Quite the contrary. In fact I am often amazed at how blacks hold themselves in such high self-regard. In my view it was justified neither by intelligence, character, ability or success in life. </p>

		<p>Since Blacks as a group have so little to take pride in, most of whatever pride they feel is really envy and hatred of Whites.  After all, if they are so great, yet have so little to show, it must be because Whites have cheated them.  It must be really gratifying to slug an old White man or rape a White woman or beat a White college boy to death.<br>
     And, to complement Black pride/hatred, Whites are taught the opposite, shame and self-hatred.  The psychologists have created a balanced system of anti-reality, aimed at destroying the mental health of Whites. </p>

<p>Lack of intelligence is exactly the reason why blacks have higher self esteems.  Smarter people are aware of their own deficiencies, and feel shame.  (Which is why the white suicide rate is higher.)  Dumber people aren&rsquo;t aware of their own failures and shortcomings.  That&rsquo;s also why black convicted murderers always want to weasel out of the death penalty, because they&rsquo;re too dumb to understand they&rsquo;ll be in prison for the rest of their lives, alluding to the whole one cookie now versus five cookies tomorrow survey.  Execution, meanwhile, is more immediate (relatively speaking), and is a concept blacks can wrap their little minds around.</p>

<p>Hispanic doesnt mean anything at all. Its a farsical fake race group. I speak spanish am I hispanic? If I&rsquo;m from spain am I hispanic? this term is a fraud. </p>
<p>Blacks face a similar problem. they should learn their roots. if they are from congo (their 20% black genese from congo that is, most are more than 50% mixed with white genes) they should develop that as an identity, not skin color</p>

<p>May I commend you on a fine post. Your quite right. People with low I.Q&rsquo;s (and correspondingly low achievements) often, paradoxically, have high self-esteem. They don&rsquo;t have the capacity for introspection or self-reflection. Shame and a sense of remorse also requires some higher mental faculties. Maybe this explains why so many blacks are legends in their own minds. Not trying to take a cheap shot here, by the way. That viewpoint is based on a lifetime of observation. </p>
