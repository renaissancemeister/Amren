<h1><a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6711692.html">PW&rsquo;s African-American Cover Image: Black Beauty or Big Mistake?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Calvin Reid, Publishers Weekly, December 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long before complaints began to circulate on Twitter about the image used on the cover of this week&rsquo;s Publishers Weekly to illustrate the annual feature on African-American book publishing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t get the &#8216;Afro Picks!&rsquo; cover. It&rsquo;s not hip, cute, or appealing,&#8221; said one tweet. Another tweet: &#8220;It seems like a big mistake,&#8221; while another read, &#8220;what exactly is the rationale behind the Afro-picks cover?&#8221; &#8220;This is a ridiculous cover. An afro with lotso picks. Get it?&#8221; &#8220;Publishers Weekly what were you thinking?&#8221; By early afternoon on Monday, Twitter was swarming with comments about the cover illustration and few of the comments were complimentary.</p>
<p>The image was a photograph taken from a new book from W.W. Norton, Posing Beauty: African American Images from the 1890s to the Present by Deborah Willis, a collection of carefully chosen photographs intended to highlight the physical and cultural beauty of African-American life. The image (Pickin&rsquo;, 1999) by Lauren Kelley is a photograph of a black woman whose hair is full of Afro picks, the ubiquitous metal toothed hair-comb of the 1970s, complete with plastic handle in the form of a black power fist. The afro picks are arrayed in the woman&rsquo;s hair to create a kind of giant sculptural Afro hair-do and the woman is leaning slightly forward to give the viewer a better look at the quirky artificially created hair-pick crown. The coverline for the image is: Afro Picks! New Books and Trends in African-American Publishing and it refers to the feature story &#8220;African-American Books in Today&rsquo;s Marketplace,&#8221; a look at the current marketplace for black books written by Felicia Pride.</p>
<p>The resulting response to the choice of that particular image and that coverline was not anticipated by the person most closely involved with this week&rsquo;s cover. That person was me, PW senior news editor, Calvin Reid. {snip} And while it never occurred to me that anyone would be offended by these images, I was very wrong and I have to acknowledge that. Quite a few people were offended by it and outraged by what some perceive as a disparaging or degrading image of a black woman. I certainly regret offending anyone and while I still love that image, I intend to think long and hard about whatever image is chosen for next year&rsquo;s cover. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an effort to respond to the complaints, I contacted W.W. Norton executive editor Bob Weil, who edited the book from which the photo was taken. He wanted to emphasize that &#8220;this is a positive and transformational book.&#8221; He recently spoke at an event promoting the book at the Studio Museum in Harlem and said, &#8220;Willis&rsquo;s book goes miles to show a more complete and honest history of the black image. One man stood up in the audience and said he&rsquo;s using the book therapeutically with his psychiatric in-patients at Bellevue to improve their self-esteem; another young woman stood up and said she came upon the book by accident and was amazed to discover a book that reflected the world she knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>For once, we agree.</p>
<p>This is an example of how blacks work as a group to destroy what one person brings to their attention as &#8216;offensive&rsquo;.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;this is a positive and transformational book.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>That may have been the intention but other people have their own agendas. Put it out in front of the black public and watch the sharks attack. More proof that it doesn&rsquo;t matter what noble goals and uplifting message you want to send. You will be crucified by someone looking for any and every reason to start a fight.</p>
<p>When it comes to black, you can&rsquo;t win even when presenting something &#8216;positive and transformational&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And these people wonder why we don&rsquo;t want or enjoy their company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to put my neck on the line befriending anyone who will find any excuse to bite my head off.<br>

		<p>Blacks are the most easily offended race on earth, and yet, at the same time, the most oblivious to the many ways in which they offend others. Take the &#8220;black power fist,&#8221; for example. A clenched fist could easily be taken as an offensive gesture by whites, and yet whites took it in stride, and even made up justifications for why it was a perfectly understandable expression. Now bring the picks back on a magazine cover, and whites again have to apologize. I agree that the safest course of action is just to stay as far away from blacks as possible.</p>

		<p> That has to be one of the ugliest photos I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It makes Whoopi Goldberg look like Miss America by comparison. When I hear the words &#8220;Afro&#8221; and &#8220;pick,&#8221; the first word I think of is &#8220;cotton.&#8221;</p>

		<p>You can not depict black people in any way without offending many of them to the point of risking a law suit.  Depict blacks as jive talking homies and you are promoting a negative and racist stereotype.  Depict blacks as successful, married, upper middle class Bill Cosby types and you are ignoring the realities of black life and covering up the scars inflicted by whitey.<br>

		<p>Those comments were probably written by outraged whites who pose as blacks online just for the sake of being PC and somehow scoring points with their bosses. It&rsquo;s ridiculous. </p>

		<p>No matter what comment is made about blacks, some publicity-seeking, money-hungry black (or white apologist) will complain.  And then the liberal MSM will cringe and exhibit shock and outrage.  Such complainers are constantly on the prowl for something to carp about.  Take the 3am-call commercial made by Hillary: several black commentators said it was supposed to make whites think of black men lurking in the bushes!  HUH?!  The best course is to totally ignore blacks, like the mainstream commercial establishment did decades ago.</p>

		<p>Blacks&rsquo; don&rsquo;t need my endorsement nor my scorn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m their worst enemy, I ignore them and treat them with deference.</p>
<p>They are nothing special and in fact are a detriment to a legal and organized society.</p>

		<p>I think the picture is repulsive myself. I know that this is a touchy subject for them but jeez, have some common sense about it. It is almost damned if you do and damned if you dont when saying anything about Blacks and their hair.</p>

		<p>While I don&rsquo;t find the image remarkable, I do find remarkable that the offended critics had nothing to say about the item of substance, the article.  Do these people read?  Do they care about what is being said about blacks who do read?  This is a culture offended by much, thankful for little.  Where matters of substance and principle are lost in the battle for a guilt-laden transfer of unearned resources.</p>
