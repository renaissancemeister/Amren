<h1>Staten Island Octomom Mamie Manneh Gets Probation in Monkey Meat Case</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Marzulli, New York Daily News, December 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal judge took mercy on a Staten Island mother of eight and sentenced her Friday to probation for smuggling monkey meat into New York.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Green argued that Mamie Manneh was not entitled to leniency because she has 11 prior arrests  &mdash;  including one for running over her husband&rsquo;s suspected mistress with an SUV  &mdash;  and cooked up a bogus defense that she had a constitutional right to eat bushmeat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Manneh, 41, who has eight children and is raising three others, pleaded with the judge not to send her to jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do it again, whether you have 11 children or 32, you will not be spared a federal prison sentence,&#8221; Dearie warned.</p>

		<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with someone else eating monkey meat (assuming it is not an endangered species). <br>
And for running over her husband&rsquo;s mistress, well, let&rsquo;s ask Elin Nordegren about that one.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Green argued that Mamie Manneh was not entitled to leniency because she has 11 prior arrests &mdash; including one for running over her husband&rsquo;s suspected mistress with an SUV &mdash; and cooked up a bogus defense that she had a constitutional right to eat bushmeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I like to say, if blacks weren&rsquo;t so violent and dangerous they would be quite entertaining to observe.</p>
<p>Here above, we have exactly those two elements coming together in the most exemplary manner. The smuggling of the monkey meat and her contention that she has a &ldquo;constitutional right&rdquo; to eat it, has to be one of the funniest things that I have ever heard. Seriously, few episodes of your favorite black sitcom could match that in the high humor category. In general, it all appears rather harmless and it would seem that probation is the way to go; however, the fact of the 11 priors, including one for driving over somebody, shows a clear criminal pattern. Here she should have gotten the maximum sentence allowable, simply to protect others from her sociopathic tendencies for awhile. As it is, she will likely breed yet another ghetto child or two, and eventually serious maim or kill someone. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m with Peejay on this one.  There really needs to be a limit to how many children third world immigrants can have in Western countries.  The monkey meat is no big deal but mass producing future murderers and rapists within our borders IS a big deal.</p>

<p>&#8216;As I like to say, if blacks weren&rsquo;t so violent and dangerous they would be quite entertaining to observe&rsquo;&hellip;and expensive.  I may very well be wrong (wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time), but I am willing to bet this brood costs our government over $100K/Yr if not more.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and rats, roaches, mosquitoes, fleas, flies, etc. reproduce a alarming rates.  Anyone see any parallels here?</p>

		<p>The monkey meat IS a big deal, because monkeys can carry extremely dangerous viruses that may be transmitted to humans when people take &#8220;bushmeat&#8221; out of the jungle. </p>
<p>I wonder if this lady* is also exercising her &#8220;right&#8221; to force white people to subsidize her brood.  </p>
<p>* (Arrested 12 times is not a mark of the sort of person I&rsquo;m used to calling a &#8220;lady&#8221;, but I guess it will have to do.  Otherwise, I might be found guilty of a crime!  One for which any degree of mercy would be unthinkable. ) </p>

		<p>The funny thing is the horror that many liberals express when they hear that these cannibals also eat &#8216;bushmeat&rsquo;! We all know that it is only Whites who have ever cared about conserving any animal species. Ecological preservation, like combustion engines, telescopes, and space travel, has only arisen among the White race. <br>
Check out &#8216;The Ecological Indian&rsquo; by Kerch for a North American prespective: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ecological-Indian-Myth-History/product-reviews/0393321002/ref=cm_cr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=0&amp;filterBy=addOneStar" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Ecological-Indian-Myth-History/product-reviews/0393321002/ref=cm_cr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&filterBy;=addOneStar</a></p>
<p>The &#8216;one star&rsquo; reviews in spite of mountains of evidence are pretty funny. </p>

		<p>She ran over her husband&rsquo;s mistress.  I wonder how much time she got for that?  Couldn&rsquo;t have been much if she&rsquo;s had enough time to have 8 children, could it?  I wonder what the other 10 arrests were for?  Couldn&rsquo;t have spent much time in jail for any of those arrests and still have time to have 8 children, now could she?  I&rsquo;ll bet nobody thought of that.</p>

		<p>Wonder who is paying for all those kids she has? Don&rsquo;t tell me, it is us of course. All that talk at the U.N. about limiting the number of children one can have makes alot of sense after seeing so many ill-equipped people such as this, draining us dry and then want to import their cultural &#8220;traditions&#8221; here on top of it. Send her and the brood back where she came from&hellip;I only feel for the monkey.  </p>

<p>How about not letting these third world immmigrants into western countries in the first place? That would nip the problem right in the bud.</p>
