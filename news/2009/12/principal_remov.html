<h1><a href="https://fwix.com/share/101_92ea634547">Principal Removes Bellview Holiday Giving Tree</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hannah Guzik, Ashland Daily Tidings (Ashland, Oregon), December 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bellview Elementary School Principal Michelle Zundel has removed a holiday giving tree at the school after a family complained that the tree was a religious symbol.</p>
<p>The move has upset dozens of parents who say the tree was not a religious symbol, but a way to celebrate the holiday season and help those in need.</p>
<p>After removing the tree, Zundel created new guidelines this week for school-sponsored holiday displays  &mdash;  effectively banning holiday trees, Santa Claus figures and Dreidels, which are &#8220;legally categorized as secular,&#8221; she said. She plans to hold a meeting to discuss the guidelines Tuesday from 7:15 to 8 p.m. in Bellview&rsquo;s conference room.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zundel said Thursday that she removed the giving tree because it offended a few students who do not celebrate Christmas. Three or four families have told Zundel they found the display offensive, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;These children felt somehow less welcome at their own school, having that symbol so prominently displayed,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Zundel acknowledged that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that holiday trees are not religious symbols and that they can legally be displayed in schools. However, she said she felt that the Bellview tree symbolized Christmas, and should be taken down in the interest of maintaining religious neutrality at the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we have compulsory attendance in our schools, we need to be more sensitive than the law requires,&#8221; Zundel said. &#8220;The displays promoted by a public school should be religiously neutral.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organizers of the second annual giving tree program said they were not promoting religion or Christmas with the tree  &mdash;  they were trying to help needy students and spread holiday cheer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing religious about it,&#8221; said Allison Hamik, a Bellview parent who helped organize the giving tree program. &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t put religious symbols on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hamik said she has spoken with more than 100 Bellview parents who are upset by the decision to remove the tree.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zundel, who assumed her position at Bellview this year after the previous principal was laid off in a round of budget cuts, said she initially allowed the display to go up because she wanted to maintain tradition.</p>
<p>But after hearing from the family who was offended by the display, she had a change of heart and decided to take it down. The family who complained did not respond to a request to be interviewed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the giving tree was not specifically called a Christmas tree, Zundel felt that it was a religious symbol.</p>
<p>&#8220;An evergreen tree decorated with lights and ornaments, I think in our culture is the definition of a Christmas tree,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When your family does not have a tree in the house, it becomes a religious symbol.&#8221;</p>

<p>Easily the most idiotic statement I&rsquo;ve read for a while.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing remotely Christian about putting a decorated pine tree in your living room. It&rsquo;s an old pagan practice from the German woods.  Prince Albert introduced it to civilized people, Queen Victoria liked it, the Brits picked it up, it caught on.  It&rsquo;s just a way to display sparkly ornaments. Nothing to do with Jesus, who was born in a country with (I think) few, if any, pine trees.  If everyone could just grasp that, we&rsquo;d all be happier, Christian, pagans, &amp; everyone else. </p>

		<p>What they don&rsquo;t realize is that the Christmas tree (Tannenbaum) actually has its roots in Germanic paganism, as a celebration of life for the winter solstice, which was considered the &#8220;rebirth&#8221; of the sun, as the sun stopped its daily apparent southern ascent and starts heading north after that day, except we now know it&rsquo;s entirely a function of both the Earth&rsquo;s tilt and solar orbit.</p>
<p>When Christianity was Germanized, the tree was integrated into Christmas celebrations, because early Christian leaders placed the birth of Christ near the winter solstice to attract people.</p>

		<p>It seems the only thing left for Christians is to take their children out of all public schools, home school them, vote down every school budget, and celebrate Christmas properly.  Heck, I&rsquo;m an agnostic and <i>I&rsquo;d</i> do that.</p>

Let me get this straight&hellip;</p>
<p>Over a hundred parents dissaprove of the Christmas trees removal but it gets removed anyway because a few find it offensive. What kind of logic is this? I&rsquo;ll bet this elementary school is predominately white and the principal a secular progressive. Yeah, that&rsquo;s it, I can almost smell it! And to add furthur humiliation to themselves, this vast majority probably won&rsquo;t push this issue and just learn to live with her decision. </p>
<p>This kind of garbage is happening with increasing regularity throughout a nation supposedly founded upon Christian principals. Either America is changing in a direction we don&rsquo;t wanna go or, its been one- big misleading lie the whole time. </p>
<p>When muslims hear about this kind of stuff happening in the west it just inflames their wrath. It sends the message we are unscupulous and worst of all &#8220;weak&#8221;.</p>
<p>They must think and say: &#8220;Those Christians won&rsquo;t fight for what they believe, but we are&#8221;.</p>
<p>Just maybe they don&rsquo;t hate the west as bad as we think because of Christianity. Maybe, their animosity grows because of our percieved weakness.</p>

<p>Well, I wonder if Comrade Principle Zundel would object to a Diversity Bush?</p>
<p>This would be some leafless and dying bush uprooted, and stuck in a small trashcan filled with sewage. Then as decorations, festive objects such as empty soup cans and beer bottles can have photos of such multicultural heroes as Martin Luther King and Fidel Castro pasted to them and hung on the Diversity Bush. Of course at the top of it, a hammer and sickle would be mounted; these should be painted bright red and trimmed in golden tinsel garland, so that no one mistakes them for religious symbols.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</p>
<p>For the customs of the people [are] vain: for [one] cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</p>
<p>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</p>
<p>They [are] upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also [is it] in them to do good.</p>

		<p>WHO are these people!! WHY should a few family&rsquo;s be allowed to ruin an American tradition, ruin CHRISTMAS in fact for the rest of these students!? If they find a damn TREE offensive, then take your offended arses to a different learning institution.<br>
The parents of this school should band together and raise HOLY hell about this (pun intended) and demand the rights of others to celebrate CHRISTMAS as American&rsquo;s have for hundreds of years. For the love of GOD, STOP giving in to these nuts!</p>

		<p>The best way to combat multiculturalism is to push school vouchers in your home state. That way you can get a safe education for your kids if you are poor and your kids can pray at school if you want. I am an atheist and I support a parent&rsquo;s right for their kids to pray in an educational setting and learn about Creationism if that&rsquo;s what they want to do, but I don&rsquo;t want my kids to have to pray as part of an organized school activity. I think school vouchers are the only possible way to accomplish these goals. I wouldn&rsquo;t have had any problem with a &#8220;Christmas&#8221; tree, however, since it was borrowed from Germanic mythology and has nothing to do with Christianity anyway.</p>

<p>Hamik said she has spoken with more than 100 Bellview parents who are upset by the decision to remove the tree.</p>
<p>When will it end? When will the blatant pandering to a few malcontented minorities or recent immigrants end? Why should a few non Christians spoil the Christmas season for the other Children?</p>
<p>Perhaps Hamik should get a consensus from the 100 Bellview parents claiming their children are deeply offended by turbans, burkhas and ceremonial daggers and other such items that really do hold a religious significance?</p>

		<p>Time to deal with this nonsense on the school&rsquo;s terms.</p>
<p>A single complaint suffices to have any display removed. FINE.</p>
<p>Let there be a single complaint for each of dozens of the school&rsquo;s lessons. One family can be offended by Arbor Day, another family can be offended by President&rsquo;s Day, yet another family can be offended by &#8220;black history month,&#8221; one family can wail and gnash their teeth over May Day, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, and so on.</p>
<p>Let them come up with a perfectly inoffensive curriculum.</p>
<p>And if the school respects one family&rsquo;s whining and not another&rsquo;s then it&rsquo;s time to ask why that might be&hellip;and when the truth comes out about that, then feelings will REALLY be hurt.</p>

<p>&gt;  I&rsquo;ll second that - or drink a great Wassail bowl to it!  But what I would really  like if for Christians to finally realize that December 25 was first the birthday of Mithra, an Persian Sun God.  Mithraism, along with ancestor worshipping Sol Invictus were the main religions (with Judaism and Arianism after) when Christianity (RLC) formalized itself.  NO ONE really knows the date or even if a man named Jesus (Paul&rsquo;s Greek name for one who would have been named Josua ben Joseph) was ever actually born.  That&rsquo;s the factual truth of it. Realize it, get over it, and get on with saving the real European culture and race. <br>

<p>There is a coniferous patch in the Middle East, the Cedars of Lebanon.</p>
<p>The best evidence, both Biblical and secular, shows that Jesus Christ was born in what we now think of as late September/early October.  This has been known for quite a long time   &mdash;   the Cromwellian interlude rulers between Monarchs in England explicitly forbid a December Christmas (thinking of it as a &#8220;pagan&#8221; influence, which it was) and ordered a late September commemoration of birth.  The Puritans bought that mentality to the New World.  The only reasons Christmas exists in the way that it does today is:  (1) Germans, (2) German immigrants in Pennsylvania, and (3) A good friend of Karl Marx, named Charles Dickens, and his &#8220;Christmas Carol&#8221; story. </p>

<p><br>
Since so many are wondering, my guess (based on the local ethnic makeup and the presence of Microsoft and because Jews are not numerous here) would be that it&rsquo;s probably a Hindu/Moslem family from India/Pakistan.  No certainty, just an educated guess.<br>

		<p>I cannot understand the motivation of the posters that are denigrating the Christmas tree tradition connected to Christianity. Why on earth do Christians have to be subjected to a standard different from that of other religions. Do you guys/girls imagine that the practices and principles of other religions, are somehow the &#8220;pure light of truth&#8221; that came directly down from heaven as practiced today?? Yet no one on this forum is bothered by that. </p>
<p>As #28, Anonymous wrote,&hellip;&#8221;It&rsquo;s just a lovely old folk custom of our people&hellip;&#8221;. I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Why tear at Christianity&rsquo;s supposed weaknesses, when everything connected with white people&rsquo;s history is under violent, relentless attack, in todays world. I swear, some of us are our own worst enemies.</p>

		<p>The only reasons Christmas exists in the way that it does today is: (1) Germans, (2) German immigrants in Pennsylvania, and (3) A good friend of Karl Marx, named Charles Dickens, and his &ldquo;Christmas Carol&rdquo; story. </p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t a Roman Emperor and the Pope have something to do with the date being Dec 25th as it is now.</p>

		<p>Make no mistake:  This is one more indication of the war on Whites and Western Civilization  &mdash;  what better symbol of a White American tradition than a Christmas Tree at Christmas?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It is time that we simply ignored these people who seek to destroy our culture&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I will never never agree with this!</p>
<p>The lefties who wish to eradicate White Americans and our traditions will not stop WILL NOT STOP until every last one of us is either dead or pounded into meek and total submission, bowing down to non-White masters, our land and wealth confiscated long confiscated.  Our enemies are relentless, vindictive, well-funded and have the media, government and academia on their side.  Whither White Race?  Do we take a stance or allow our children and grandchildren to kow-tow to non-Whites, our traditions love forever, Whites mocked and scored forever as racist Nazis?</p>
<p>I deal with the standard school curriculum every single day and it is blatantly anti-White, teaching your children &#8216;across the curriculum&rsquo;  that they are hateful colonists who should admit their collective guilt and turn over their wealth and land to non-Whites because or the so-called damage they believe Whites have inflicted upon them.  Never are we given credit NEVER for raising the standard of living for everyone on the entire planet, creating medical technology that has doubled life spans and creating the wealthiest freest civilization the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Our history is being re-written, our traditions destroyed, and worse, our great accomplishments purloined and credited to non-Whites who do not have the IQ power to invent, create or think deeply about anything.</p>
<p>We must put a stop to this, starting at the local level.  Keep a sharp eye on the idiots on your city council and school board, they can do a lot of damage to your local schools and completely destroy your communities and neighborhoods.  Vote &#8216;em out  &mdash;  speak up to your neighbors and friends, write letters to the principal and another to the superintendent and head of the school board (yes, I do this, probably at great risk, but I am tired of the viciousness against my family, my people group and for me it is personal and it should be for you too) tell everyone you know and care about.</p>
<p>As the missing parachutist writes:  If you don&rsquo;t fight for your traditions you deserve to lose them.</p>
<p>From QD:</p>
<p>&#8221;..except we now know it&rsquo;s entirely a function of both the Earth&rsquo;s tilt and solar<br>
orbit..&#8221;</p>
<p>Wonder who figured out that the sun doesn&rsquo;t rise magically every day in the sky by the decree of one priest  &mdash;  and to not question this as it would end one&rsquo;s life on the spot?</p>
<p>These raging lefties wish us dead while freely using the technology and innovations we&rsquo;ve created  &mdash;  computers, antibiotics, medicines, internal combustion engine, space travel, cell phones, televisions and the electrical grid needed to power it.  </p>
<p>They should be on their knees thanking us and making sure people like us don&rsquo;t disappear from the face of the earth, instead, we are told the best course of action for us is to hand over our treasure and homelands and die.</p>

<p>Bellview Elementary School tree restored</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Several of the 150 people in the Bellview gymnasium clapped when Zundel made the announcement at the beginning of the meeting.</p>
<p>She said she changed her mind about the tree, which had tags requesting gifts for needy children at the school, after hearing from hundreds of people nationwide who complained about the removal&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The complaints worked, that why we must keep them up whenever and wherever we come across injustice to Whites and our traditions.</p>
<p>Now, if we can get the principal removed.</p>

		<p>As my mother (a devout Catholic) used to say when we placed too much emphasis on the toys and gifts, &#8220;Christ&#8221; is in the word &#8220;Christmas&#8221;. Let&rsquo;s be honest. Despite all the talk about pagan winter festivals and modifications of dates, this is a celebration of the birth of Christ. If you call it a Christmas tree, it is a religious symbol. <br>
And lets be fair. If we are going to have the symbols of one religion in public schools, and close the schools for that religion&rsquo;s holidays, then let us do it for all. Let us close the schools during the Jewish High Holy Days, and decorate the schools appropriately. Let us close the school lunchroom during Ramadan.<br>
With regard to the political rights of minorities: by design, the Constitution ensures minority rights. U.S. Senators are apportioned on a state by state basis, and not by population. And remember, Gore won the popular vote. </p>

Whiteplight:</p>
<p>There is a coniferous patch in the Middle East, the Cedars of Lebanon.</p>
<p>&gt; So, there was once forests of them.  I said nothing about this. However, others - experts of pagan history note that the same fears of winter shortage and hardship existed in North Africa and the Middle East as in Europe, and the evergreen tree was seen as a hopeful sign of ongoing life.  There were a number of pre-Chistian religions that featured a sun god that died on or near the winter solstice and was reborn three days later.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best evidence, both Biblical and secular, shows that Jesus Christ was born in what we now think of as late September/early October. &#8220;</p>
<p>&gt; Best evidence?  Who, what?  I have studied this question for years, so if you have names and sources, I would love to learn them and read for myself.  The earliest gospel is at best 20-40 years after the claimed events.  Paul never met or knew &#8220;Jesus.&#8221;  These are undisputed facts.  The famous &#8220;witness&#8221; Josephus passages have been exposed as second century forgeries, probably done by Ireneaus, the prolific bishop of Lyon (France).</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been known for quite a long time  &mdash;  the Cromwellian interlude rulers between Monarchs in England explicitly forbid a December Christmas (thinking of it as a &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; influence, which it was) and ordered a late September commemoration of birth. The Puritans bought that mentality to the New World. The only reasons Christmas exists in the way that it does today is: (1) Germans, (2) German immigrants in Pennsylvania, and (3) A good friend of Karl Marx, named Charles Dickens, and his &ldquo;Christmas Carol&rdquo; story.&#8221; </p>
<p>&gt; This is completely a modern apologist fabrication.  Puritans did much to overturn the Roman Catholic practices, but the non-observance of December 25 as the day was not one of them.  That the Roman Catholic Church made December 25 the day is all too well known by anyone who studies the history of the RCC knows this as well as the clear and stated intention of bringing all the pagan beliefs in order to make conversion easier.  Dickens did bring back the tree as a celebration motif, but your claims of communist design are both illogical and a frank fabrication.</p>
<p>I was once a theology student.  I recommend anyone interested in these questions read one or more of the books by theologian Bart Ehrman.  &#8220;Misquoting Jesus&#8221; covers much of the issue that Question Diversity and I have debated in these posts.</p>
<p>I of the opinion that relying on and projecting fraud will not aid the white survival movement.  This is why I jump on certain posts and stories.  I am not trying to be antagonistic toward any one person or the white survival or realist movement.  I hope to help shape some of its thought and how it ultimately is viewed by those we need to convince of our right and deserts.</p>

		<p>As an insert regarding the celebration of Christmas in the Colonies, these paragraphs help illuminate some of the factual reality.  New England didn&rsquo;t celebrate until after the establishment of the U.S., but before the time of Dickens and (Marx).  Cromwell was certainly a killjoy, (and great killer for Christ) but only the northern most parts of the colonies were affected, and not all of them.  The Puritans in England sought to end the celebration of Christmas period, and succeeded for a time.  But many in England and the Colonies went on celebrating on December 25 as they had since the establishment of the Roman Church.  For example, my Quebecois ancestors lived in the town of Massena, established on the St. Lawrence River in 1802 and were among the founding inhabitants. The town was named for one of Napoleon&rsquo;s generals.  The town and surrounding area was heavily French and Ruled by the Catholic Parish.  They celebrated Christmas in Quebec and on the south side of the St. Lawerence River on December 25 from the time of first settlements in the 17th century. There are no records of fines or anything else attempted.</p>
<p>Also, interesting to note is that the Orthodox Church celebrates the Nativity in January.  Religious symbologists have identified the halo through its use on Orthodox Icons from the earliest periods as direct copies of Appollonian art, where Apollo is pictured with the sun behind his head.  Sun Gods typicaly die at the Winter Solstice and gestate during Winter.  They are then born in Spring. The Orthodox and Catholic art with Mary and the Egg harken to Eoster, the Goddess of Spring and the promise of renewal.  All are from religions that extisted before and comtemporary with the formation of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.  And there is a lot more.</p>
<p>With that in  mind, here is a clip from a website about Christmas in the Colonies.  The Southern Colonies Celebrated Christmas.  (Note: My own maternal ancestry is from the Rev. Thomas Carter, the first protestant minister ordained in the colonies, Mass. 1630).  </p>
<p>&#8220;Was Christmas celebrated throughout all the colonies? No. The celebration of Christmas was outlawed in most of New England. Calvinist Puritans and Protestants abhorred the entire celebration and likened it to pagan rituals and Popish observances.(!!!) In 1659, the General Court of Massachusetts forbade, under the fine of five shillings per offense, the observance &#8220;of any such day as Christmas or the like, either by forebearing of labour, feasting, or any such way.&#8221; The Assembly of Connecticut, in the same period, prohibited the reading of the Book of Common Prayer, the keeping of Christmas and saints&rsquo; days, the making of mince pies, the playing of cards, or performing on any musical instruments. These statutes remained in force until they were repealed early in the nineteenth century. In 1749, Peter Kalm noted that the Quakers completely dismissed the celebration of Christmas in Philadelphia. Kalm made another interesting observation about the Presbyterians as well. He wrote in his diary: </p>
<p>Christmas Day&hellip; .The Quakers did not regard this day any more remarkable than other days. Stores were open, and anyone might sell or purchase what he wanted&hellip; .There was no more baking of bread for the Christmas festival than for other days; and no Christmas porridge on Christmas Eve! One did not seem to know what it meant to wish anyone a merry Christmas&hellip; .first the Presbyterians did not care much for celebrating Christmas, but when they saw most of their members going to the English church on that day, they also started to have services.<br>
Christmas Day in 1775 must have been a great disappointment for the Presbyterian missionary, Philip Fithian. A year earlier he had experienced the finest of Virginia Christmases the residence of Robert Carter, Nomini Hall. But in 1775, Fithian toiled as a missionary in the western counties of Virginia among the Scotch and Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. </p>
<p>The following is part of his diary entry for December 25: </p>
<p>&#8220;Christmas Morning  &mdash;  Not A Gun is heard  &mdash;  Not a Shout  &mdash;  No company or Cabal assembled  &mdash;  To Day is like other Days every Way calm &amp; temperate  &mdash;   People go about their daily Business with the same Readiness, &amp; apply themselves to it with the same Industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anglicans, Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Moravians celebrated the traditional Christmas season with both religious and secular observances. These celebrations in eighteenth- century America were observed by the aforementioned communities in cities such as New York and Philadelphia, in the Middle Atlantic colonies of New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, and in the South.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthering our education on our own history is always beneficial and I think will result in a clearer vision that is more likely to work. <br>
