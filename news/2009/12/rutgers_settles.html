			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Whitley, Star-Ledger (Newark), December 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rutgers University has settled a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by four groundskeepers who in 2006 accused the school of denying them promotions and ignoring a noose hung on a campus building.</p>
<p>The workers  &mdash;  three African-Americans and one Hispanic  &mdash;  held maintenance jobs at the Cook/Douglass campus in New Brunswick for at least 12 years. In October, Rutgers agreed to pay each of the men $71,875 in lost wages and other damages, while also reimbursing their attorneys $300,000 in legal fees, according to court papers.</p>
<p>Both sides pledged to keep the settlement confidential, but it was released after The Star-Ledger filed a freedom of information request under the state&rsquo;s Open Public Records Act. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Rutgers University remains committed to a workplace that is open, inclusive and free from all forms of discrimination,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs argued their bosses continually passed over them for promotions, advancing white colleagues who benefitted from exclusive training opportunities and interviews marred by unfair questions and biased scoring.</p>
<p>Six white applicants finished with more points than any of the four minority candidates, the complaint said  &mdash;  partly because the white applicants received identical high scores on questions even after giving different responses.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Rutgers said those who were promoted had more experience and interviewed better.</p>
<p>In court documents, they said one of the plaintiffs had obvious flaws. He had been removed from a leadership role after cursing at a female supervisor, admitted chronic tardiness, and committed safety errors while operating a backhoe.</p>

		<p>They have to officially discriminate against white males every possible chance (then ratchet up the hate-whitey propaganda machine to explain it all) in order to avoid being sued, and still, they get sued.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Rutgers University has settled a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by four groundskeepers&hellip;.The workers &mdash; three African-Americans and one Hispanic&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>No sympathy here for a university that has NO problem openly discriminating against Whites and/or Christians: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The InterVarsity Multi-Ethnic Christian Fellowship at Rutgers University was banned from campus because of its rule that &#8216;leaders must seek to adhere to biblical standards and belief in all areas of their lives.&rsquo; Rutgers ruled that allowing a religious student group to select its leadership on the basis of religion constituted discrimination&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Got that?  Choosing a leader that reflects the values of the group he&rsquo;s charged with leading constitutes discrimination.  Do you think Rutgers would ban a black (or any other non-White/non-Christian) group for requiring its leaders be of that racial/ethnic/religious group?</p>
<p>Luckily, our friends at FIRE were paying attention: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;FIRE wrote to the president of Rutgers, to the members of the Board of Trustees and Board of Governors, and to the university&rsquo;s major donors, urging the administration to undo the damage to the Fellowship&hellip; Soon after, Rutgers and the Fellowship released a joint statement announcing that they &#8216;have amicably resolved any and all issues.&rsquo;..  the students will be allowed to organize on Rutgers&rsquo; campus in a manner consistent with the purposes of their freedom to associate on the basis of their shared beliefs&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Good for FIRE for notifying the university&rsquo;s major donors.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, FIRE still rates Rutgers with a Red Light for &#8220;at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;purposefully making or causing to be made a communication or communications anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours.</p>
<p>Acts may not always be in violation of civil, criminal, or University codes but may warrant intervention if they cause students to lose confidence in their ability to participate in the educational mission of the University&hellip; Restoration often involves educational programs that help to prevent acts from recurring&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Re-education programs for &#8216;restoration&rsquo;?  The spirit of Pol Pot is alive and well at Rutgers!</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Rutgers agreed to pay each of the men $71,875 in lost wages and other damages, while also reimbursing their attorneys $300,000 in legal fees, according to court papers&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hope the major donors and alumni know.</p>

<p>I would love to see what qualifies as&#8221; exclusive training opportunities&#8221;</p>
<p>Biased scoring is anything that does not put blacks on equal footing &#8220;thereby favoritism in AA&#8221;. What did they do that favored whites I would love to see. <br>
