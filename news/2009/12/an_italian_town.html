<h1><a href="https://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1943676,00.html">An Italian Town&rsquo;s White (No Foreigners) Christmas</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Israely, Time, December 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Italy&rsquo;s influential Northern League Party has stood out over the past decade for its particular knack in finding new (and not-so-new) ways of offending people based on country of origin and color of skin. {snip}</p>
<p>The latest swipe by the Northern League attempts some kind of holiday spirit. The league-led city council in Coccaglio, a small town east of Milan, has launched a two-month sweep  &mdash;  from Oct. 25 to Dec. 25  &mdash;  to ferret out foreigners without proper residency permits. It has been dubbed Natale Bianco, or &#8220;White Christmas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudio Abiendi, a longtime Lega Nord member who leads security policy on the city council, told the daily La Repubblica that he came up with the initiative as a way &#8220;to start cleaning things up&#8221; in Coccaglio, a town of 7,000 with some 1,500 immigrant residents. &#8220;For me, Christmas isn&rsquo;t the celebration of hospitality, but rather of Christian tradition and our identity,&#8221; he said. Abiendi also told the paper that approximately half of the 150 inspections already carried out turned up people who no longer had a right to reside in Italy. He said he would report them to national authorities.</p>
<p>The city council office is responding to requests for interviews with a press release denying any racist intent, noting that the Natale Bianco moniker was not an official public designation. The impromptu local census &#8220;was born to know the real number of foreign-born citizens present in Coccaglio so as to better manage the economic resources destined for integration projects.&#8221; Local officials say the measure follows a national policy set forth by Italy&rsquo;s Interior Minister, Roberto Maroni, a member of the Northern League, to give local administrators more authority in monitoring the residency status of foreigners.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both the economic scapegoating of immigrants and the vision of the league&rsquo;s White Christmas irk the Comunita di Sant&rsquo;Egidio, an influential Catholic lay group that defends immigrant rights. &#8220;The insults and rhetoric help to exploit uncertainty and create political consensus,&#8221; says Mario Marazziti, Sant&rsquo;Egidio&rsquo;s spokesman. &#8220;But in the end, it is against the national interest. Italy is in demographic decline, and the only real chance is to work to integrate immigrants, who are the last hope for the country to start to grow again. All the rest just creates conflict and puts off resolving this crisis.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Thank you, Mr. Abiendi, for showing both pride and intelligence.  You possess both qualities in greater abundance than the &#8220;Catholic Lay Group&#8221; whose only aim is to displace you and your people.

<p>Not true.  It is estimated that Italy lost up to 1/3 of its population in the 14th century as a result of the Bubonic Plague.  While devastated, Italy (and the rest of Europe) recovered and during the ensuing centuries Italians contributed significantly to the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution.  They did this without a massive influx of third-world immigrants.  Does anyone believe there is an African Galileo ready to emerge from Italy&rsquo;s urban slums?</p>

		<p>Signore Marazzitti should rethink his solution to the problem of ethnic decline. How about a movement to encourage Italians to reproduce? They need an awareness raising campaign to bolster ethnic pride and to emphasize the tragedy of a world without Italians who have contributed so much to Western Culture. <br>
Italy should reach out to young talented Italo-Americans to emigrate to Italy and to assimilate into the culture while producing offspring to assure the survival of a great people.<br>
I have no doubt that America&rsquo;s decline will occur before Italy&rsquo;s.<br>
La Guerra Sucia against White Americans is underway and due to the coverups being carried out by out information media, no one is aware of the scope of this guerrilla war. I call it La Guerra Sucia in memory of the war of extermination carried out by the military government of Argentina against it&rsquo;s own dissenting citizens. Our government and media by their unwillingness to deal with these atrocities is guilty of complicity in this calculated massacre of Whites. Washington is no better than Pretoria in it&rsquo;s deliberate ignorance of this slow genocide.<br>
I can envision a reverse migration of Whites back to Europe.</p>

		<p>This is a good show, but leftist professors will spend the next 60 years defaming whites the world over for the &#8216;fascist reaction&rsquo; committed by this small town. The folks in this small town need to widen their drag net just a bit. Think globally but act locally. </p>

<p>If this isn&rsquo;t an outright cry for Native White Italian displacement and eradication I don&rsquo;t know what is.  Japan&rsquo;s population is also in sttep decline yet there are no screams there for large-scale non-Japanese immigration  &mdash;  they&rsquo;ve learned well from watching Western countries commit suicide.</p>
<p>The only way to increase the Native Born Italian birthrate is for the government to start paying for it  &mdash;  they can use the US as an example. We pay non-Whites to pro-create at will and make this as easy as possible by providing them with free housing, food, medical services, educations for their children, cash grants and other accoutrements of White Western Civilization.   They are not required to work or to feel responsible or thankful that others pay for all their expenses.  Their job is to pop out baby after baby that they cannot feed, clothe or educate in order to displace the Native White population as quickly as possible and strip them of their political power and wealth.  </p>
<p>The USG has not only made sure non-Whites receive Free White Money to procreate but to suppress any criticism whatsoever from those who are forced to work and pay for their replacement population.  The government and its arm of the media immediately brand any White complainers as racist, hateful Nazis for deigning to keep their hard-earned money, their country and their heritage.  They are even promising to prosecute complainers by filing charges of Hate Speech, further threatening Whites with jail time and punitive fines in order to strip them of their jobs, wealth and reputations.</p>
<p>What a great deal these non-White immigrants have!  No wonder billions of the world&rsquo;s Third World destitute want to come live in the civilization created by racist, hateful Whites.</p>
<p>Guess Japan was paying attention:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;According to reports released by the National Institute of Population and Social Security last month, Japan&rsquo;s birth rate is declining extremely fast&hellip;.and identified young people as not having children because they cannot afford to get married or because of heavy education costs. </p>
<p>The central government plans to take several landmark steps to change the situation. &hellip;Plans include doubling current child allowances, from April this year, to 100 US dollars per month for couples having their third child&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/ycr92gp</p>
<p>Good thing the Japanese don&rsquo;t have a Fifth Column whose main goal is to displace the Native Born population, subvert their will and insist that &#8216;the only solution&rsquo; is to displace themselves by importing violent, low IQd, parasitic hoards from the Third World.</p>

  A`bit off topic I suppose, but you could find it relevant.<br>
      When I first started travelling many years ago, my friends and family were amazed at my stories at how different people were in the various countries I&rsquo;d been to. How the South Americans were prone to be more excitable,how the Greeks and Italians could be yelling abuse at you one minute and loving you the next. And it was wonderful the diversity I came across. And to my mind this is the way diversity works. Let Italy be Italian,let Spain be Spanish, and so on. But when I got home to England it was wonderful to feel that this was home. Home with it&rsquo;s warm beer,the old world courtesy of the city gents in London,everybody compaining about the weather. My goodness what a country, but it was home and I wouldn&rsquo;t have traded it for all the sun soaked places i&rsquo;d been. It was Engand,not better, not \worse, but mine.</p>

		<p>Number 3#&hellip; Interesting point you make that instead of importing foreign protoplasm,&hellip; Italy should invest in a program to re-create itself according to its own lineage and genetics. The first time I went to my fathers home town/rural Italy.. when asked to compare the US to Italy by a local that knew my father in the past&hellip;I gave the analogy that we in the states enjoy allot of vitality from America&rsquo;s size and power and resourses as well as variety in the diversity in human cultures, (a sort of hybrid vigor) On the other side of the coin.. in the same vein we are like an artificially fertilized tomato plant with a tall skinny stem hardly capable of supporting itself on its own. What I meant in this latter statement is that the diversity and power come at the cost of an actual Identity,Inner harmony,&hellip;(thicker stem). I don&rsquo;t know if the future of the distinct European nations will be true to their past in some seminal way or eventually become completely estranged from their origins&hellip;?</p>

		<p>To Mr. Marlowe:</p>
<p>The plague years in Italy were also the years of great cathedral-building efforts which required large supplies of labor.  When the plague came, building still had to go on, so the managers imported Central Asians to replace the dead.  </p>
<p>Wealthy Italian families would use young foreign girls as servants, often Turkic (Asiatic) girls from the Ottoman Empire.  Additionally, some centuries before, Asiatic tribes (Huns etc.) would invade the Empire, and some of them (or their kids) decided they liked the Roman way of life and became citizens. </p>
<p>There are plenty of Italians who have some Mongoloid features (several examples in my own life:  my 8th-grade science teacher and my college optimization prof, both whom appeared to be at least half Japanese).  </p>
<p>Given this heritage, maybe the best strategy for Italy would be to focus first on keeping out Subsaharan Africans of any citizenship.  (By the way, Chanequa Campbell  &mdash;  the Harvard undergrad under investigation for involvement in drug-related murder  &mdash;  has run away or is planning to run away to Milan, to where she already had escaped from Harvard a few times; she says she feels comfortable there in part becuase of its large African immigrant/expat community.) </p>
<p>Agreed that that African population isn&rsquo;t going to produce any Galileo, or much else of genuine long-term worth for that matter. <br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a rich irony!   They hate us terrible white racists, and the exploitive capitalist USA which ruthlesslyoppresses people of color,  but nonetheless they are so eager to come live among us that they will try or do virtually ANYTHING to get here.</p>
<p>I guess they assume that all that wealth is just growing out of the landscape,  somehow. It has nothing to do with the white population that is living here producing it. It&rsquo;s just an accident of nature that the USA and Canada are richer than Africa or Mexico.   </p>
<p>What does race have to do with it? All cultures are equal and all people are interchangeable.  Everyone who&rsquo;s been to college knows that!  Only ignorant, uneducated, white racists would think otherwise.  Stupid rednecks!</p>

		<p>I keep hearing this mantra that we must have population growth or we are doomed. In the dawn of history I started my working life in a bank. There were some 8 tellers and perhaps 80 office staff, including a tea lady. The Bank hours were from 10-3 yet I remember being there many a time deep into the night because there he books did not balance, have had to find that last shilling or else. In the last 50 years the banks have shed some 80% of their staff(in relation to the amount of work done per individual). One computer does the the work of 100 clerks. It is the same in any industry you care to name even forgetting about the ones that have been outsourced. The same in the post office, insurance, farming, in fact in every aspect of working life but government. Every decade we need less and less people to do the same job.</p>
<p>There are two solutions to a smaller workforce producing the same amount of goods. Reward the high producers or invent new needs . Unfortunately we have chosen the worst solution.</p>

<p>There were similar leaflets that were being handed out when I was in Milan. They were all over. I have one somewhere; I&rsquo;ll have to look for it.  It had more writing  on the back. It said,  essentially:  </p>
<p><b>&#8220;We accepted immigration.<br>

<p>   And what chance would that be? What&rsquo;s wrong with an Italy full of Italians? Sometimes unlimited growth is a bad thing. Italy is already a crowded, polluted post industrial country. Maybe a reduction in population is a good thing. What stake do these immigrants have in Italy? Many are not even the same race or religion as the rest of the indigenous Italians. Won&rsquo;t they be an unassimilated permanent minority? Can they really appreciate or contribute to the rich culture of Italy? I doubt it, I really doubt it. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the email I sent to the author of this Time article: &#8220;I was so pleased to read this article. Non-white immigration is the greatest world-wide threat to the white race. Whites have built the most successful societies in human history and non-whites from failed societies are flooding into them, a process that can only bring degradation. To reverse this tide is the most urgent practical measure whites can take and I praise the nationalist parties of Europe. They know the score!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Marazitti, did it ever come into your mind that some immigrants cannot be &#8220;integrated&#8221; at all in a liberal society?  Look at France, Netherlands or England and its Muslim and black population. What will you do if integration of your desired immigrants fails?<br>
Why is it always that the West has to integrate the immigrants, and not themselves who (should) do that?  We owe them nothing, they owe us everything for getting shelter in our countries.<br>
I can tell you that Eastern Europe and Japan have so far opposed massive immigration, and guess what: they simply don&rsquo;t have any problems with immigrants, and they are doing well without experiencing your predicted &#8220;conflict&#8221; and &#8220;crisis&#8221;.</p>
<p>I agree that immigrants who are easier to assimilate in fact exist (particularly from Europe and East Asia), but their population is facing the same decline, so importing them will hurt their countries.</p>
<p>If you still insist on integration, there is theoretically only one way to do that on any group of immigrants: rigorous and draconian enforcement (for example, forcing Muslims to convert to Christianity and to expel them if they violate against a set of behavior rules), but I bet it would never be practiced in a &#8220;tolerant&#8221; Christian country, and political monsters like EU and UN would never let that pass. So the best option left is encouraging Italians to produce more babies.</p>

		<p>Some of points to think about: First, when people suggest that government &#8216;ought to do something&rsquo; about getting their indigenous citizens to create larger families, the ideas bandied about always focus on supporting young mothers or motherhood in general. No program I have ever heard of seeks to reach out to young men and encourage them to become good dads, or explain how fatherhood of a large family may differ (and be even more spiritually rewarding than doting on the one-and-only.)</p>
<p>Another point is that if secularized (read: anti-Christian) governments in the USA or elsewhere try to &#8216;solve&rsquo; the retirement entitlement debt bomb by mandating that public health care *only* offer euthanasia for certain terminal conditions (don&rsquo;t laugh - Oregon is already trying this - the state plans will offer to cover an &#8216;assisted suicide&rsquo; but no coverage for pain meds in some cases) - then I can imagine certain peoples of certain religions returning to collect and &#8216;hold the fort&rsquo; in Europe in selected countries where the locals are making known that traditional their indigenous peoples are welcome and recent invaders are *not.*</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Ireland doing something about it? If so it would be possible to imagine a country with white-Catholic traditions (Lithuania, Ireland) welcoming back its diaspora of peoples. &#8216;We won&rsquo;t abort your children here or try to kill you after you retire! Come back and enjoy yourselves!&rsquo;</p>

		<p>This whole &#8220;demographic decline&#8221; thing is a canard. First Europe is a small and densely crowded continent. It could sure use some more elbow room. Historically Europes&rsquo; population didn&rsquo;t just go up non-stop like some kind or trajectory from a rocket. It has always been subject to huge and sudden swings. Consider the chaos caused by the fall of Rome, the dark ages, the &#8216;plague of Justinian&rsquo; which virtually depopulated vast areas of the Balkans. How about the Black death? This wiped out a full-third of Europe&rsquo;s people in just a few years! No feudal baron said Europe had to import Africans or mideasterners to counter &#8220;demographic decline&#8221;. In fact for the Europeans serfs who survived their circumstances improved dramatically. They were now in high demand and had to be well-treated (or else they would just leave and go to another baron&rsquo;s estate and offer him their services). The problem is not lower birthrates but population replacement from immigration of an alien people into Europe.</p>
