<h1>Asian Carp May Have Breached Barrier for Lake</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tina Lam, Detroit Free Press, November 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Great Lakes advocates said today they&rsquo;ve been told that DNA evidence of one species of Asian carp has been detected above the electric barrier intended to keep the fish out of Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>The DNA was detected in a channel that splits off the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal below Chicago, and leads to Lake Michigan, known as the Cal-Sag channel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DNA testing of water samples near the electric barrier on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal taken beyond the barrier and Lake Michigan on Sept. 23 and Oct. 1 shows the presence of Asian carp about 1 mile south of the O&rsquo;Brien Lock, about 8 miles from Lake Michigan, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies said today.</p>
<p>Previously, DNA of Asian carp has been found a mile below the barrier.</p>
<p>Last week, the Corps and Illinois Department of Natural Resources said they planned to poison nearly 6 miles of the ship canal in early December to kill any possible carp so they would not be able to breach the main barrier when it goes down for maintenance for a few days.</p>
<p>Asian carp have taken over the Mississippi and other nearby rivers and can grow to huge sizes. Because they are voracious feeders and breeders, they are expected to out-compete native fish once they reach the Great Lakes. The Army Corps has built two electric barriers, one experimental and the other permanent, to try to keep them out, but in the past three months, new DNA tests have shown evidence of the carp much nearer to the barrier than scientists had thought.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barge operators are already upset about the loss of business from the multiday shutdown scheduled for early December. Barges bring oil, coal, cement and other crucial goods through the canal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The O&rsquo;Brien lock is the last stop between the Calumet River, where fish DNA has been found, and Lake Michigan.<br/>

		<p>They already have something far worse than Asian carp in the Great Lakes.  Sea lampreys got in after the shipping canals and locks were finished.</p>

		<p>The lampreys came and wiped out the lake trout.  They managed to poison them.  Then the alewife (herring) came in so they put salmon in the lake which feeds on them.  Next came the zebra mussel.  And last but not least the Asian Carp.</p>
<p>There has to be some way to make lemonade out of these lemons.  Asian Carp have to be good for something.</p>

		<p>Lampreys are actually eaten in parts of Europe, and apparently they make good bait for other fish.  The taste is supposedly meatier than other fish.</p>
<p>I imagine Asian carp are fairly good; they&rsquo;re eaten in Asia.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that they&rsquo;re good eating. In fact, IIRC, they were introduced by Asian immigrants for that very reason. </p>

<p>Exactly. Some &#8220;Asian&#8221; societies find these fish to be good eating? Harvest and ship to them by refer airplane? </p>
<p>Virtual barriers and fish blocks and such probably will not work in the long run. Eggs of fish carried in the wet feathers of water fowl are a common method by which fish are transplanted from one body of water to another.</p>

		<p>The asian snakehead-quite a nasty invasive species I might add-theatens the ecological stability of America&rsquo;s eastern river and lake systems.</p>
<p>It has been established with one hundred certainty that this ecoligical meltdown is a directly attributable to an asian LEGAL  IMMIGRANT who released a snakehead fish&hellip;or two directly into the Potamac River. He wa practicing an ancient chinese ritual. His sisteer-also a chinese LEGAL IMMIGRANT had just recovered from a pottnially fatal illness. Her brother-the culprit in this very true and depressing story-following ancient chinese ritual that required the release by a family,member  of a snakehead fish back into the chinese river system where the snakehead fish lives in happy ecological equillibrium with other fish species in the chinese river system. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, he released the very pregnant snake head fish into into an AMERICAN river system.</p>
<p>Without a doubt,chinese and all other asian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS pose a  major existential threat to the ecocosystems and the species that comprise these ecocosystems. </p>
<p>You would have thought by now, that Brenda Walker would have written about this on vdare.com.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, the case against asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION is very strong. NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS and the ecosystems of OUR AMERICA were much better off when the asians were not in OUR AMERICA.</p>
<p>How did NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICA ever survive when the asians were kept out under that wonderfull national origins policy that WE had in place in OUR AMERICA for so many decades? Very well thank you.</p>

		<p>Polluting the local gene pool with non-native species seems to be the way of things these days. There are inescapable parallels to immigration. The phrase &#8220;voracious feeders and breeders&#8221; particularly stands out. Yet what is universally regarded as &#8220;bad&#8221; in wildlife is somehow made &#8220;good&#8221; in human affairs. The invasion of the carp threatens the existence of the native species; the invasion of humans threatens to destroy the native culture. Both are clearly destructive influences. The carp we kill. The humans we give welfare, subsidies, jobs and all sorts of other goodies. The carp are clearly being discriminated against! We should call for immediate Congressional hearings to determine how this could have happened!</p>

		<p>While the snakehead is a valuable food fish, it is also a top-level predator.  Worse still, they have a lung-like organ and so long as they stay relatively wet, they can wriggle 1/4 mile across land to colonize additional bodies of water.  Importation of live snakeheads is illegal in most countries outside their native Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>A decade ago, one Los Angeles supermarket sold some $25,000 worth of illegal live snakeheads, and sure enough, some of these fish later turned up in California reservoirs.</p>

<p>Part of the reason the American Indian was defeated by whitey is that there was a severe and irredeemable change in the eco-system from the INADVERTENT RELEASE OF THE COMMON EARTHWORM INTO THE EASTERN PART OF NORTH AMERICA. There were no earth worms in the eastern part of North American prior to Jamestown. The inadvertent release of earth worms by the Jamestown colonists meant that over a period of hundreds of years, the eastern forests became radically different, no leaf mold to inhibit forest growth, and consequently many of the animals preyed upon for food by the American Indians became fewer in number. Strange but true.</p>

		<p>When NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS are completetly driven out of California, it is only matter of time before the ecosystems of California will be completetly wrecked causing their collapse. Post-1965 non-whites are movinhg to California to live in harmony with nature. They are comming there to expand and expand&hellip;and expand some more. If California is cordoned off from the rest of AMERICA,  at some point in time. Then NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS will have to spend decades on ecological remediation to make California livable again&hellip;..for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of issues that should be discussed on vdare.com.</p>
