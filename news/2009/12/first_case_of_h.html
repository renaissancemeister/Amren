<p>Then came the fevers. They bathed and chilled the skinny frame of Oswaldo Juarez, a 19-year-old Peruvian visiting to study English. His lungs clattered, his chest tightened and he ached with every gasp. During a wheezing fit at 4 a.m., Juarez felt a warm knot rise from his throat. He ran to the bathroom sink and spewed a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Doctors say Juarez&rsquo;s incessant hack was a sign of what they have both dreaded and expected for years  &mdash;  this country&rsquo;s first case of a contagious, aggressive, especially drug-resistant form of tuberculosis. The Associated Press learned of his case, which until now has not been made public, as part of a six-month look at the soaring global challenge of drug resistance.</p>
<p>Juarez&rsquo;s strain  &mdash;  so-called extremely drug-resistant (XXDR) TB  &mdash;  has never before been seen in the U.S., according to Dr. David Ashkin, one of the nation&rsquo;s leading experts on tuberculosis. XXDR tuberculosis is so rare that only a handful of other people in the world are thought to have had it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is really the future,&#8221; Ashkin said. &#8220;This is the new class that people are not really talking too much about. These are the ones we really fear because I&rsquo;m not sure how we treat them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forty years ago, the world thought it had conquered TB and any number of other diseases through the new wonder drugs: Antibiotics. U.S. Surgeon General William H. Stewart announced it was &#8220;time to close the book on infectious diseases and declare the war against pestilence won.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, all the leading killer infectious diseases on the planet  &mdash;  TB, malaria and HIV among them  &mdash;  are mutating at an alarming rate, hitchhiking their way in and out of countries. The reason: Overuse and misuse of the very drugs that were supposed to save us.</p>
<p>Just as the drugs were a manmade solution to dangerous illness, the problem with them is also manmade. It is fueled worldwide by everything from counterfeit drugmakers to the unintended consequences of giving drugs to the poor without properly monitoring their treatment. Here&rsquo;s what the AP found:</p>
<p>_ In Cambodia, scientists have confirmed the emergence of a new drug-resistant form of malaria, threatening the only treatment left to fight a disease that already kills 1 million people a year.</p>
<p>_ In Africa, new and harder to treat strains of HIV are being detected in about 5 percent of new patients. HIV drug resistance rates have shot up to as high as 30 percent worldwide.</p>
<p>_ In the U.S., drug-resistant infections killed more than 65,000 people last year  &mdash;  more than prostate and breast cancer combined. More than 19,000 people died from a staph infection alone that has been eliminated in Norway, where antibiotics are stringently limited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drug resistance is starting to be a very big problem. In the past, people stopped worrying about TB and it came roaring back. We need to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&#8221; said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who was himself infected with tuberculosis while caring for drug-resistant patients at a New York clinic in the early &rsquo;90s. &#8220;We are all connected by the air we breathe, and that is why this must be everyone&rsquo;s problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>This April, the World Health Organization sounded alarms by holding its first drug-resistant TB conference in Beijing. The message was clear  &mdash;  the disease has already spread to all continents and is increasing rapidly. Even worse, WHO estimates only 1 percent of resistant patients received appropriate treatment last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen a huge upburst in resistance,&#8221; said CDC epidemiologist Dr. Laurie Hicks.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is the top single infectious killer of adults worldwide, and it lies dormant in one in three people, according to WHO. Of those, 10 percent will develop active TB, and about 2 million people a year will die from it.</p>
<p>Simple TB is simple to treat  &mdash;  as cheap as a $10 course of medication for six to nine months. But if treatment is stopped short, the bacteria fight back and mutate into a tougher strain. It can cost $100,000 a year or more to cure drug-resistant TB, which is described as multi-drug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and XXDR.</p>
<p>There are now about 500,000 cases of MDR tuberculosis a year worldwide. XDR tuberculosis killed 52 of the first 53 people diagnosed with it in South Africa three years ago.</p>
<p>Drug-resistant TB is a &#8220;time bomb,&#8221; said Dr. Masae Kawamura, who heads the Francis J. Curry National Tuberculosis Center in San Francisco, &#8220;a manmade problem that is costly, deadly, debilitating, and the biggest threat to our current TB control strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juarez underwent three months of futile treatment in a Fort Lauderdale hospital. Then in December 2007 he was sent to A.G. Holley State Hospital, a 60-year-old massive building of brown concrete surrounded by a chain-link fence, just south of West Palm Beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;They told me my treatment was going to be two years, and I have only one chance at life,&#8221; Juarez said. &#8220;They told me if I went to Peru, I&rsquo;m probably going to live one month and then I&rsquo;m going to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are two ways to get drug resistant TB. Most cases develop from taking medication inappropriately. But it can also be transmitted like simple TB, a cough or a sneeze.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, HIV and AIDS brought an even bigger resurgence of TB cases. TB remains the biggest killer of HIV patients today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 60 million people visit the U.S. every year, and most are not screened for TB before arrival. Only refugees and those coming as immigrants are checked. The top category of multidrug-resistant patients in the U.S.  &mdash;  82 percent of the cases identified in 2007  &mdash;  was foreign-born patients, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>The results are startling among those tested, said Dr. Angel Contreras, who screens Dominicans seeking to enter the U.S. on immigrant visas. The high rate of MDR-TB in the Dominican Republic coupled with high HIV rates in neighboring Haiti are a health crisis in the making, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re really looking at a global issue,&rsquo;&#8221; said Dr. Lee Reichman, a TB expert at the New Jersey Medical School Global Tuberculosis Institute. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not a foreign problem, you can&rsquo;t keep these TB patients out. It&rsquo;s time people realize that.&#8221;</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His [Juarez&rsquo;s] treatment cost Florida taxpayers an estimated $500,000, a price tag medical director Ashkin says seems like an astronomical amount to spend on someone who&rsquo;s not an American citizen. But he questions how the world can afford not to treat Juarez and others sick with similar lethal strains.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an airborne spread disease .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so when we treat that individual, we&rsquo;re actually treating and protecting all of us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is true homeland security.&#8221;</p>
<p>In July, at age 21  &mdash;  19 months after checking in  &mdash;  Juarez swallowed his last pills, packed a few small suitcases and wheeled them down the hospital&rsquo;s long corridor.</p>
<p>The last time doctors saw him, he was walking out of the sanitarium into south Florida&rsquo;s soupy heat.<br>

		<p>This is scary stuff, and possibly just the tip of the iceberg.  I believe the economy will completely tank in the next 10 years or so.  The ensuing social chaos will cause widespread sanitation and nutrition problems, which in turn will open the door to various pandemics, the likes of which we have not experienced in nearly 100 years.  All brought to you courtesy of multiculturalism.     </p>

		<p>The reason: Overuse and misuse of the very drugs that were supposed to save us.</p>
<p>This is a lie.</p>
<p>The truth is there is no such thing as &#8220;antibiotic resistance&#8221;.  Or rather that this is not a phenomenon related to antibiotic use in normal patients.  It is virtually unknown in mostly white populations that use far more antibiotics than in the US, let alone can be afforded by any &#8220;third world&#8221; country.</p>
<p>What is the problem?  AIDS.  Antibiotic resistance is caused by treating these conditions in people who do not have an immune system, essentially, because it was destroyed by AIDS.  And AIDS is rife in these populations because of completely abnormal sexuality (prostitution, gay sex, complete sexual immorality leading to dozens, even hundreds of partners etc.) and intravenous drug use.</p>
<p>These populations are probably going to wipe themselves out because of their unnatural behaviors that are anti-life in the extreme.  If not AIDS, than something else will inhabit that niche.  It&rsquo;s just something that happens to a people when they embrace evil.</p>
<p>But here is the problem.  By allowing those people to come HERE.  They bring this WITH THEM.</p>
<p>It will only spread to the extent that we allow them to spread.  It is only a problem to the extent to which we tolerate, embrace and mix what we are with what they are.</p>

		<p>But as with the recent Whitehouse directive to let foreigners in with HIV?AIDS, Im going to assume testing for this affliction would be to politically incorrect also.</p>
<p>TB was for the most part, wiped out in this country, until the last decade of immigration from the third world. Diversity is wonderful. And its always been my opinion that incurable super duper TB is going to be the superbug that hammers humanity, not swine flu etc.  </p>

<p>SO what does that mean?? he has been cured and going about his life full of hope as an illegal alien in America?? OR, more likely, going of to infect other Americans (AND more ILLEGAL aliens) with the very same TB strain?</p>

This is not the sort of person that you want in the same hospital that you are in and is not the sort of person you want living in the same country that you live in..<br>
All of the fine work done eradicating the diseases from western societies was a complete waste of effort if we are going to allow these disease ridden parasites into our countries.<br>
Our politicians and the MSM really are traitors to their countries.</p>

		<p>Two things in this article amaze me, the first being that Mr.Ashkin&rsquo;s statement on how stupid it is to spend half a million dollars on an illegal immigrant(which he hastily took back, likely after remembering he was talking to a reporter) made it into the article.  The second is Dr. Lee Reichman&rsquo;s hilarious notion that you can&rsquo;t keep people with infectious diseases from entering the country.  </p>
<p>Did all known tests for disease suddenly stop working and this is the first we&rsquo;re hearing about it?</p>

		<p>This disease has in recent years sprung up in Sub-Saharan Africa where the white Africans are being marginalised, including doctors and nurses, with the affirmitive action policies of the new ex-terrorist government, the African national Congress.  As you know this means the sacking of qualified and experienced African whites so that blacks can replace them regardles of ability.</p>
<p>Just think, you are on a long distance airliner and there are one or more such sufferers on board, coughing away and pumping their germs ito the aircraft air-conditioning system where they can be recirculated infecting other passengers.</p>
<p>It is a terrifying thought.  Add to that the suspect servicing standards (affirmative action again)on the commercial aircraft in those countries and the odds can be really stacked against you. </p>

		<p>They spend a half a million dollars on this guy, not even an American citizen, yet I heard of a case the other day where a 31 year old father of two had a stud wall fall on him and break his back in three places and the government won&rsquo;t help him because he doesn&rsquo;t have enough &#8220;paid in&#8221;.   He was working for this other guy and of course that guy didn&rsquo;t have any insurance.  We are talking the poor south here.

		<p>China is a draconian society and we certainly don&rsquo;t want to emulate their totalitarianism.  We would NOT have to become like them, we would NOT need unconstitutional laws like Patriot Act, we would NOT see the re-emergence of sicknesses we had eradicated, we would NOT need or have pushed on us &#8220;public options&#8221; IF we did one simple thing: shut off immigration legal and illegal from third world countries entirely, and have a strict policy of immigration ONLY for European highly skilled, highly educated, financially stable immigrants who are entirely free from criminal records.  We should also shut down allowing immigrants to come here for reasons of persecution or whatever.  Always, those immigrants come from third world countries and then bring to us their third world problems and illnesses when they get here.  Always.  </p>

		<p>I contracted asthma at the age of 5 which nearly killed me around the age of 12.  </p>
<p>Unbeknown to my family and general practioner, I also had contracted TB for which I&rsquo;d never been treated, strange as that may sound for sombody born and reared in the UK.</p>
<p>It was a decade later when I was 18 that a hospital consultant I was referred to, spotted what were now dormant TB lesions on my lungs.  Luckly, no flare up of the TB ever happened again although the asthma continued to afflict me until I was 22 when new desensitization treatment was tried out on me.  All this was over 30 years ago.</p>
<p>In spite of my protracted asthmatic condition, my appetite wasn&rsquo;t affected and it was that coupled with all home cooking which probably helped keep my immune system up to speed.<br>

<p>So typical. At the entrance of a restaraunt recently, there was a flyer asking for donations for an American family with a sick child who had mounting medical bills. They couldn&rsquo;t afford them yet made a little too much for government help. The US government pays half a million for some diseased foreigner that never should have been let in in the first place yet neglects and refuses to help average American citizens. So typical, I hate our government and its&rsquo; traitors. Let Peru pay his bill.</p>

<p>Exactly. If I were in a foreign country, say Sweden,and were being treated for a deadly disease that the government there was spending half a million on, I think I&rsquo;d be very grateful. However, not this Peruvian guy, no he goes out of his way to raise hell, no gratitude whatsoever.</p>

It certainly IS terryfing. It&rsquo;s just as important that these Third World passengers be examined for any DISEASES they might be carrying as for explosives or weapons.  In fact, what&rsquo;s the difference, really?  Either way, they&rsquo;ll kill you, and a lot of other people too.  A bomb is just quicker and more merciful.</p>
<p>Oh, but I forgot   &mdash;    can&rsquo;t do that!  It might &#8220;offend&#8221; someone.</p>

<p>&#8220;They used to confine such folks and &ldquo;keep them&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Yes.  I recently was reading about the famous Typhoid Mary. She was not sick herself, but was (totally unknown to her) a carrier of the typhus bacillus.  She worked as a cook, and everywhere she went people around her died. When this problem was finally narrowed down and identified, she was confined  FOR LIFE to a hospital on an island in NY City. She wasn&rsquo;t allöwed any visitors and never saw freedom again. </p>
<p>The poor woman was not responsible for any of this, but that remedy was the price of protecting the general public.  Back then, the welfare of the vast majority came before the individual   &mdash;  - nor was there any problem with Political Correctness.<br>
