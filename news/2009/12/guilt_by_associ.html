			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Unruh, WorldNetDaily, December 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;More Americans this month felt that there was more of a climate of fear over their freedom of association  &mdash;  with more than one in three  &mdash;  36 percent  &mdash;  saying that they believed Americans had reason to fear punishment or retribution based on who their friends were or who they met with. This is chilling stuff!&#8221; said Fritz Wenzel of Wenzel Strategies.</p>
<p>The WND/Wenzel telephone survey was conducted Dec. 18-21 using an automated telephone technology calling a random sampling of listed telephone numbers. The survey included 26 questions and carries a 95 percent confidence interval. It included 823 likely voters. It carries a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points.</p>
<p>His survey revealed that the WorldNetDaily Freedom Index took a huge plunge in December, dropping to its lowest ever mark of 46.4 on a 100-point scale. The assessment is based on respondents&rsquo; answers to a series of monthly questions about how they feel about a basketful of liberties they enjoy as Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wenzel described the issues undermining Americans&rsquo; confidence in their liberties as linked to Washington&rsquo;s moves toward President Obama&rsquo;s agenda.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a dramatic negative move in the WorldNetDaily.com Freedom Index this month, dropping for the first time below the dead-level-even mark of 50 on its 100-point scale. It now stands at 46.4, down from 53.6 just a month ago</p>
<p>&#8220;This coincides with the commencement of the serious votes on the health care bill, which apparently imposes some harsh restrictions on virtually every aspect of the American health care system,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly half of all respondents  &mdash;  47 percent, confirmed there has been a decrease in freedoms under Obama&rsquo;s reign. That was up from 40 percent a month earlier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wenzel reported among Republicans, 73 percent confirmed &#8220;a decrease in freedoms under Obama, up from 61 percent just one month ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And among political independents, the percentage who said the same thing increased by 7 percent this month over last,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Along with increased worries about the loss of American freedoms, &#8220;more Americans this month felt that there was more of a climate of fear over their freedom of association,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thirty-six percent said they thought Americans has reason to be concerned about punishment based on their friends and acquaintances, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;An increase in the fear that Republicans said they personally feel when expressing their thoughts using a bumper sticker or campaign button was offset by a growing sense of freedoms felt by Democrats to do the same thing.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly one voter in five said Americans are &#8220;not at all free&#8221; to speak their minds without fear of punishment and another one in six said the country is &#8220;not very free.&#8221; One in seven even have &#8220;great fear&#8221; that punishment or investigation could result from their choice of worship.</p>
<p>The means for the government to obtain such information also is an issue. More than three in 10 believe the government is using &#8220;scanners&#8221; and electronic records to create &#8220;great intrusion&#8221; into American lives. Nearly 10 percent express &#8220;great fear&#8221; at even expressing their own opinions.</p>
<p>About one in six said they were not very free or not at all free to even put a bumper sticker expressing their political or religious beliefs on their vehicles. One in five expressed the same reservations about discussing their beliefs if the conversation was in a public area. And more than one in four said they were not very or not at all free to express their opinions without fear of government penalty.</p>
<p>The result was that more than 25 percent of Americans censor their own expressions because of the perceived threat.<br>

		<p>While I think it has gotten worse under Obama&rsquo;s reign, this has been going on for quite awhile, and under the tutelage and with the countenance of many Presidents of both parties.  And to the extent that people fear the loss of their freedom of expression, for the most part, it&rsquo;s not government diluting or crushing it, it&rsquo;s private industry.  </p>
<p>Most people make their livings by being someone&rsquo;s employee.  And therefore, fear of the supervisor and the corporation is the governing force in most people&rsquo;s lives.  And with corporations going more and more &#8220;global&#8221; and &#8220;new world order&#8221; and embracing of equality and diversity, it stands to reason that a white employee would be intimidated into silence on racial or other issues.  </p>
<p>In order to get freedom back, government will have to curtail the natural rights of corporations, with something called an Employees Bill of Rights, so that the people that work for corporations won&rsquo;t fear the supervisor.  This is where paleo-libertarians and paleo-conservatives are behind the times, and just don&rsquo;t get it.  Their ideology was built in an era when most people controlled the economic factor from which they made a living.  And it just doesn&rsquo;t apply today.</p>

		<p>There seems to be more disapproval for the President than approval and he does not seem to be listening as he increases his appearances in every media venue he can find and continues with the same rhetoric about a healthcare reform plan that Americans disapprove of  and fear will ruin our healthcare system and their healthcare relationships, particularly the senior citizens of the country.  Conservatives seem to outnumber all other political persuasions and that number continues to grow.  Americans love their freedoms and will continue to fight for them.  In the national security area, Obama and the Secty. of Home Security do not seem to have a clue on the recent plane bombing incident.  <br>
   <br>
Home Security Napolitano, aka &#8220;Incompatano&#8221; said the system worked and Obama Calls the terror suspect an &#8220;Isolated Extremist&#8221; while Al Qaeda claims credit for his actions. The attitudes of our two &#8220;leaders&#8221; could cost us more than just our freedoms.</p>

		<p>I would not exactly call it &#8220;fear&#8221;.  Most people I know, however, have at least some sense that the country is on the cusp of civil war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than that.  This is not a simple disagreement over legitimate political idealogy.  It&rsquo;s more an impending sense that there is an attempt in the works to dismantle our democracy and replace it with communism.  A significant minority (correctly) percieve this as anti-white, anti-christian in its motivation.</p>
<p>But make no mistake.  Since Obama was elected, more guns have been bought that would be required to outfit the entire militaries of both china and india.  And enough ammo has been bought to pop a cap in every single person living in America.</p>
<p>If it comes to it, the vast majority of Americans will fight.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid the loss of states rights back in 1864 has enabled  this. There is a price you pay for a dominating central government&hellip; similar to the price nations might be paying for a dominating one world government, FREEDOM/IDENTITY. Aware people have got to sharpen their minds and body&rsquo;s and beat the serpents at their own game&hellip;This game has always existed, Hyenas versus lions. The first step is surveying all the options then concluding the most just, procede accordingly* Its still a great country and a great world*</p>

		<p>&ldquo;About one in six said they were not very free or not at all free to even put a bumper sticker expressing their political or religious beliefs on their vehicles. One in five expressed the same reservations about discussing their beliefs if the conversation was in a public area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now why might that be?</p>
<p>The climate of fear and the culture of dread in relation to one&rsquo;s freedoms of expression and speech, is not at all paranoid or otherwise abnormal. It is something that has been carefully crafted by the political-corporate-media troika. Multiculturalism and this fashinable monstrosity that it has spawned, General Secretary Obama, are only the zenith of this totalitarian nightmare of thought control and its more ominous repression of independent action/communication. Anything and everything that doesn&rsquo;t worship &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is subject to accusations of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;hate,&rdquo; that can very well see you destroyed professionally/academically, if not also otherwise imprisoned somehow.</p>
<p>This has gone on for over 40 years!</p>
<p>Or put another way, go ahead and put a reasonably mild pro-white bumper sticker on your car like: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Preserve America&rsquo;s White Majority;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Whites, The Fashionably Forgotten Endangered Species,&rdquo; and see what happens. I Just hope you never have to defend yourself against an act of violence &ldquo;of color,&rdquo; and have something like that come to a court&rsquo;s attention!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>I notice they don&rsquo;t reveal WHO is afraid to put a bumper sticker on their car.  Conservatives.  Conservatives don&rsquo;t &#8220;key&#8221; or otherwise vandalize cars based on what is on the bumper.  Liberals and Democrats do.  Frequently.  As to fearing Gov according to who your associations are, again, it&rsquo;s not Democrats that fear.  Not when Napolitano, the most unqualified hack to ever hold the position she holds, tells the country and the world that the religious right is the biggest threat of terrorism in this country, more so than even Islamic fascism.  The Government has become evil, but Obama and his appointees are the most evil and threatening crowd to ever hold office and power.  It will get worse.  Much worse.</p>

		<p>If the questions directly pertained to white identity issues then I&rsquo;m sure the numbers would be much higher. I&rsquo;ve talked to a few hundred whites as part of my missionary hobby for AmRen. My estimate would be around 90% of whites who are strongly afraid to express themselves about white issues or have white race affiliations. I&rsquo;d say all whites are at least somewhat afraid of these things depending on context.</p>

		<p>I find that the overwhelming majority of folks who throw terms like &#8220;freedom&#8221; and &#8220;liberty&#8221; really have no working concept o either. Blind jingoism is often what passes for &#8220;patriotism&#8221; these days, with FNC, flag-waving types always quick to attack the &#8220;hate-America-first&#8221; crowd, instead of realizing that America has been hopelessly compromised, and is no longer the country many stubbornly want to believe, nay, insist it still is!  </p>
<p>Thus, those who are now eager to blame the Obama administration for a grand loss of &#8220;freedom&#8221; don&rsquo;t impress me much, for the last admin was no better, nor the one before that, etc.</p>
<p>People need to wake up and get over this fantastic idea that the govt - right or left - is working for them, or will ever in any way or form be responsible for doing anything but eliminating what little genuine freedom we still have! </p>

A Salvation Army Major was shot dead in front of his children at Christmas in Little Rock.  This guy and his wife spent their lives doing good for their community. A police official was interviewed on Fox News this morning but was not willing to give out any information due to the ongoing investigation. This link below tells the tale. Surprise, surprise!!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;He serves us, at our pleasure, mind you.&#8221; -&#8220;Serves us&#8221;? The good fellow has obviously not been around for quite a while, to put it very cautiously. He, and all too many others too, still have illusions about the true nature of the political system. They still naively believe that politicians would still faithfully adhere to the noble principles of the founding fathers of today more then two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Folks, I&rsquo;ve some news for you: Whatever the official theory says about &#8220;our&#8221; current western political system, politicians - at least nowadays - &#8220;serve&#8221;, if they &#8220;serve&#8221; anyone at all, only their clientèle, their special interest groups; and especially those among them who gave them big campaign donations. And of course and above all - themsevles! But no one else; least of all the &#8220;common people&#8221;.</p>
<p>This may not be pleasant news, but it is high time to face up to reality.</p>

		<p>Re: Question Diversity.  It was government that forced big business into the diversity cult.  Businesses did not adopt quota systems/speech codes because this was their choice; they did so because it was the only way to avoid discrimination lawsuits and keep the EEOC off their backs.  I suggest you read &#8220;Lost Rights&#8221; by James Bovard.</p>

		<p>11 Anonymous at 9:05 PM has a point: Just who is worried about being punished for their beliefs?  People who recognize that the races are not equal or interchangeable, and object to policies that ignore those facts.  This isn&rsquo;t new.  Many years ago, I drove an airport shuttle van.  When I took the job, I was told that some people would share their darkest secrets with an anonymous stranger, me, and it was true.  Sometimes people would carefully sound me out, and then start talking about what was otherwise unspeakable: race or immigration.  The truth is suppressed in this country, and nobody knows how many people secretly agree with us.  But I think that these academics that find &#8220;racism&#8221; under every White skin may not be far off the mark.  <br>

		<p>The first thing that comes to my mind is the so called &#8220;Southern Poverty Law Center&#8221; [SPLC-ZANU-PF].</p>
<p>If you are a blogger and link certain web sites to your blog, you can be placed by the SPLC on a list of &#8220;haters&#8221; they maintain. Just a mere line is enough to get you labeled as a &#8220;hater&#8221;.</p>
<p>This Morris of the SPLC said too that groups such as his can do &#8220;stuff&#8221; the government cannot do. The intention is to have a chilling effect, what they call it, on free discussion of issues, whatever the nature.</p>

		<p>Employers have a right to fsoter a work environment that is both collaberative and civil.  That being said we do need an employee&rsquo;s bill of rights.  An individual should be able to express their cultural, political or social point of view WITHOUT fear of loosing their employment, property or freedom, no matter how unpopular with the employer (or government) that may be.  Off the employer&rsquo;s property, off the time clock, freedom should be a given.  Say something un PC and many employers will fire a white man, regarless of his work performance.  Even without government sanctions this puts a chill over open and honest discourse.  Even saying something un PC can result in a man losing his livelyhood even if he is self-employed if the ACLU, NAACP or SPLC decides to sue.  Even if he wins the cost of defense can bankrupt a business.  Freedom of speech must be strengthened.  But since we have &#8220;hate thought&#8221; laws that ONLY apply to Euro-Americans (and were supported and passed by white legislators) we are in quite the pickle.</p>

		<p>Some of the posters here alluded to another reason, and that is the fear of an attack at the hands of various groups of far left college students, (&#8220;anarchists,&#8221;) egged on by one or more professors.  Hardly any politician of either party, liberal or conservative, have the courage to take on the educracy, b/c the political class is convinced that education is a third rail.</p>
<p>Jewamongyou:</p>
<p>I agree that government forced diversity onto businesses, but they aren&rsquo;t exactly resisting.  With all the politicians they buy and the campaign money they spread around, they have a powerful enough voice in the public policy formation process such that if they didn&rsquo;t want this nonsense, they wouldn&rsquo;t have had it.  Therefore, that&rsquo;s why I think they agree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the subprime meltdown   &mdash;   These banks love diversity just as much as the governments that &#8220;forced&#8221; them to draw these loans.  I&rsquo;m nobody in particular, just some shmuk in schmuckville.  Yet, I knew that drawing these mortgages based on the premise of perpetually increasing real estate values was a bubble ready for bursting, b/c I knew that it would be impossible for said borrowers to pay the monthly notes.  Especially after an ARM readjustment.  So I knew this, and not one whiz kid economist, accountant, etc. working for these banks could figure this out?  I don&rsquo;t buy the Rush Limbaugh line that the banks had no culpability.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make is that most right wingers make a mistake fretting about government tyranny.  (Even though they&rsquo;re correct in their assertions.)  Most people just won&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re talking about, b/c the arrogant FBI/SPLC doesn&rsquo;t affect them.  But if you start talking about your freedom being diluted through the decades-long supervisor/employee economic culture, then they&rsquo;ll understand, b/c most people make a living by being somebody&rsquo;s employee.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Wenzel reported among Republicans, 73 percent confirmed a decrease in freedoms under Obama, up from 61 percent just one month ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>To clueless Republicans, freedom and discretionary money are synonyms.  Money is the only thing Republicans are &#8220;free&#8221; to complain about.  </p>

		<p>Jedderman (#19)is correct.  In a previous job I had to deal with the SPLC; I nearly lost said job because I had the audacity to ask a question of a federal auditor who was associated with the SPLC.    In a nutshell, to openly disagree with them is to risk being smeared as a hater, as a racist, etc.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Jewamongyou&#8221; I have to agree with &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221; regarding Corporate America&rsquo;s whole-hearted embrace of all things &#8220;PC.&#8221; While it is entirely true that this all began with government pressure, Corporate America has so thoroughly immersed themselves in the &#8220;diversity&#8221; racket and all that goes with it, that no entity that wasn&rsquo;t altogether philosophically receptive to this idiocy in the first place(for any number of reasons)would conduct themselves so. In other words, yes they had to accept it&hellip;but they certainly didn&rsquo; have to wallow, revel in and make it their own as they have!</p>

		<p>I think the point in #1 was missed&hellip;. the word REIGN&hellip;. as IF this arrogant socialist were some monarch. He is not a king, nor a prince.  He is far from that, and even less qualified to run the US than he would a 7-11. </p>
<p> He serves as our President. I don&rsquo;t like it anymore than anyone else, but constitutionally, that&rsquo;s his role, to SERVE a term that we voters (mistakenly) hired him for. He works for US.  When our displeasure is exercised in 2012, he will be gone, and not a minute too soon. </p>
<p>Anyone else notice a lot of obama stickers came off cars in the past year? I find it hard to meet anyone who still admits to voting for him. </p>

		<p>Personally, I think it would be a lot more clear, if it was a lot more specific.  What are they &#8220;afraid&#8221; of?  Being worried about being arrested or sued is one thing.  Being worried about being embarrassed is something else.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too embarrassed to give your honest opinions due to atmosphere or company, that&rsquo;s a lack of courage, not a lack of freedom.  If you require people to nod along with your opinions before you are willing to defend them, then you&rsquo;re not oppressed, you&rsquo;re a coward.</p>
<p>Just the opinion of a passer-by.</p>
