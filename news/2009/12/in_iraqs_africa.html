	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But on the packed dirt streets of Zubayr, Iraq&rsquo;s scaled-down version of Harlem, African-Iraqis talk of discrimination so steeped in Iraqi culture that they are commonly referred to as &#8220;abd&#8221;  &mdash;  slave in Arabic  &mdash;  prohibited from interracial marriage and denied even menial jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Recently, they have begun to campaign for recognition as a minority population, which would grant them the same benefits as Christians, including reserved seats in Parliament.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black people here are living in fear,&#8221; said Jalal Dhiyab Thijeel, an advocate for the country&rsquo;s estimated 1.2 million African-Iraqis. &#8220;We want to end that.&#8221;</p>
<p>On a recent weekday afternoon, a group of black children and adults wearing flip-flops stood in a dirt field waiting for cars to drive up so they could wash them.</p>
<p>It is their only source of income, they said, because no one will hire them.</p>

		<p>Sounds like the pre-Giuliani era &#8220;squeegy men&#8221; of New York City. </p>
<p>It is my understanding that the Saddam Hussein regime pandered to Iraqi&rsquo;s African population heavily.  This probably explains why black politicians were so opposed to us going into Iraq.  I was opposed going into Iraq, too, but I oppose the black politicians&rsquo; opposition just as much as I opposed the original invasion.  Motivation is even more important than the position.</p>

		<p>There are now blacks living in every corner of the globe, from Asia to Canada to the Middle East, and I&rsquo;ve yet to see any of them show any appreciation or gratitude for their adopted countries. </p>
<p>Even though they have more $ and freedom than they ever would in a black-run nation, they still endlessly whine about how miserable they are and how they&rsquo;re being &#8220;discriminated&#8221; against.</p>

Therefore, withholding those women from them is considered &#8220;persecution&#8221;. As has been said, if life is so miserable for them in Iraq, why don&rsquo;t they return to Africa?  I&rsquo;m sure many charitable organizations would pay for their repatriation.</p>

<p> &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t they leave&#8221;&hellip;.</p>
<p>For the same reason blacks don&rsquo;t leave America, (or the U.K., Canada, France or any other country they can get into), they know perfectly well that for all their complaining any non-Black country offers them a better quality of life then any black country. That&rsquo;s why! Go check out Haiti sometime. Or Jamaica. Or any sub-saharan African country. Look at what blacks have done to Detroit, once one of America&rsquo;s leading cities.  </p>

		<p>Flamethrower is right. Iraqis are not black and there is no such a thing as African Iraqi. </p>
<p>And the article has a point, &#8220;abed&#8221; means both slave and black in Arabic, most of the &#8220;white&#8221; Arabs (Syrians, Iraqis, Lebanese), especially upper class who aren&rsquo;t mixed, despise them.</p>

<p>When that happens, Mr. Thijeel it will be the Iraqis who will live in fear from blacks. Unfortunately that is how it is everywhere, either blacks live in fear or you live in fear from them. No third option.</p>

<p>What are the Iraqi Jews referred to as in Arabic?  Hardly matters, virtually all fled the country due to persecution in the 50s.  The few that are left &#8220;stay in their homes out of fear of kidnapping or execution,&#8221; according to one.  Likewise the Iraqi Christians, who are subject to daily bombings and killings.  And the blacks are whining about <i>interracial marriage</i>?</p>

<p>Actually they are not blacks, mostly Veddoid (very ancient Indian/Dravidian) remnants, apart from recent migrations.<br>

		<p>The one thing that American blacks and white Liberals alike will never admit is that blacks are the only race universally despised the world over. Of course if they admitted that fact they would have to look for the reasons why? That is a rock they will never flip over. Perpetual victimhood is a much more lucrative place to be.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t the leave?  Because they&rsquo;ve been in Iraq for at least one thousand years.  They are Iraqi.  They have little in common with other Africans except skin color. It will be interesting to see whether the effects of the US occupation of Iraq, when it finally ends, will prove to benefit this group of Iraqis or not.</p>

		<p>Deniz must be joking about absence of blacks in the Ottoman run middle east. Well, here is an illustrative story <a href="https://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/" rel="nofollow">https://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/</a> from New York Times as of 1856. It says that (gosh!) there were many black slave women in Istanbul, but that their owners would kill their mixed race children by these women out of race purity concerns. Of course, one might imagine that not all slave owners in the history of Middle East were equally brutal, so presumably there was some gene flow from blacks into the general population.</p>

<p>There are in fact, blacks in Saudi and Kuwait but they are not citizens, and in case all don&rsquo;t know it, the muslim (caucasian) Saudis and Kuwaitis dislike blacks intensely..think of them as good for nothing but slave labor..I know this to be true, an I think they&rsquo;re right.<br>

		<p>  There can be little doubt that the blacks were introduced as slaves. And once freed, remained permanently in Iraq. As to discrimination, Arabs may claim religious kinship with blacks but Arab attitudes and local traditions speak otherwise.</p>

_________</p>
<p>But according to your logic, all white Americans would have some Sub-Saharan and Amerindian genes because they lived with them. Is this the case? I doubt it.</p>
<p>Here is the haplogroup distribution in Turkey (Paper: Excavating Y-chromosome haplotype strata in Anatolia):</p>
<p>The major components (haplogroups E3b, G, J, I, L, N, K2, and R1; 94.1%) are shared with European and neighboring Near Eastern<br>
populations and contrast with only a minor share of haplogroups related to Central Asian (C, Q and O; 3.4%), Indian<br>
(H, R2; 1.5%) and African (A, E3*, E3a; 1%) affinity.</p>
<p>Note the E3* is North African, not Sub-Saharan. Indian could be classified as Caucasoid.</p>
<p>As you can see, the African affinity is negligible (
<p>You can assume that Arabs resemble their neighbors, they may have more European contributions due to crusades.</p>
<p>Caucasian Middle Easterners despise blacks intensely, far more than European Caucasians, as SKIP states. There are no room for blacks in Saudi Arabia, except as slaves.</p></p>

		<p>The black ancestry in the middle east is on the maternal lineage. It won&rsquo;t show up in Y haplo groups.   </p>
<p>Deniz is a Turk, in case anyone hasn&rsquo;t figured that out.  Anyway, black ancestry is mostly in the Arabian peninsula, Persian gulf, Southern Iraq and North Africa, not so much in Turkey.  </p>

		<p>I spent 2 years in Iraq and ran into a couple of Black Iraqis.  I was intrigued and asked them alot of questions about their life and I also asked other Iraqis questions on their perceptions of them.</p>
<p>The Iraqis I talked to were of mixed opinion on whether they would let one of their daughters marry a black Iraqi, but at least half of them said they would.  Of course this was west of Baghdad, and there are very, very few of them there.   Almost none really, I only ran into 2 in two years.</p>
<p> Almost all black Iraqis live in the south around Basra, and so attitudes indeeds eem to be different toward them there from what I gather.  The answer is probably that they have more experience with them.</p>
<p> The seem to have little voice in the country though, and are invisible on the political scene.</p>
