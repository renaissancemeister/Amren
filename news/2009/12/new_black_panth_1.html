<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The leader of the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense says the U.S. Justice Department was right to drop a voter intimidation suit against his group because the case was weak.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Suspended.&#8221;  Wow, what a punishment.  I wonder where the SPLC is with a lawsuit.</p>
<p>And I also wonder where the rag tag long haired cabal that likes to intimidate the hotel where AR conferences are held when it comes to the Black Panthers and the hotel where they&rsquo;re convening.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t consider video taped evidence weak. There is no record to set straight. We know what we saw. I have to assume since they suspended the thug..I mean member who stood outside the polling place, he was in fact intimidating voters, thus by their own admission, the case is in fact NOT weak.</p>

		<p>If you have never seen Shabazz on television, you&rsquo;re in for a bit of entertainment when you do. </p>
<p>He reminds me of the black in school who wasn&rsquo;t liked by anyone, including blacks.  He has a sissified personality that would drive away most anyone, and he comes across as uneducated yet he claims to have a law degree.</p>
<p>I saw him interviewed by Michelle Malkin on Fox, and she made a total fool of him. He was rattled so badly he started talking and wouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;.or couldn&rsquo;t&hellip;. stop, interjecting appeals like, &#8220;As a person of color you should be ashamed of yourself for talking the way you do,&#8221; or words to that effect.</p>
<p>I just want to add that I&rsquo;m glad this Holder is refusing to prosecute these criminals for committing an obvious crime that was video-taped.  Added to the many other pro-black incidents, like Obama&rsquo;s blind defense of the ghetto talking professor, Henry Gates, and the many incidents to come, it will give those whites who don&rsquo;t know what the real world is all about a view behind the media curtain that shields them from these anti-white harsh realities.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a big black eye&hellip;pardon the pun&hellip;.for Obama if blacks rioted while he was still president?</p>
<p>Knowing blacks as I do, I can say that it&rsquo;s a very real possibility.</p>

		<p>Interesting how black &#8220;leaders&#8221; consider a cop within sight of a polling place &#8220;voter intimidation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, given the number of blacks with criminal records and outstanding arrest warrants, there admittedly is some basis for their claim.</p>

		<p>AG Holder gave the OK for Clinton to pardon MARC Rich when he was Asst. AG.  Now as AG he is running amok by allowing the dismissal of a default judgment against the New Black Panthers for voter intimidation with threats and a nightstick.  Black Asst. AG Loretta King engineered this without one word of explanation.  The case had already been won!<br/>
Now AG Holder is going to bring the leading 9/11 terrorists to NYC for trial with full Constitutional rights after they all wanted to plead guilty and accept the death penalty.  This will take years and cost millions and endanger NYC.  Why?  Why doesn&rsquo;t Obama stop it?  This is so outrageous that it is completely unbelievable.  IS Obama out to destroy America as we know it?</p>

		<p>Ranger - While I agree with most of your post above and as much as I despise Mr. Obama, I do not want blacks to riot.  I lived through the riots of the 60&rsquo;s when I was growing up in Baltimore.  They destroyed businesses that had been in business when my parents were kids.  They stole, looted and burned and the National Guard, that was stationed in Baltimore, could do nothing to them.  Their guns were empty.  It is one of my worst childhood memories. </p>

		<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me either if blacks riot.  Some are already frustrated that The Messiah hasn&rsquo;t delivered free mansions, lucrative jobs, reparations, etc. to every black person in the nation.  Vicious crimes of racist resentment against whitey are on the rise, and even the Black Caucus is balking against the Prez&rsquo;s wishes.  Fuzzy-headed leftists continue to blame the white establishment, thus provoking the ghetto.  The non-black mainstream is getting more vocal in condemning the silly, worn-out arguments excusing bad minority behavior  &mdash;  or even ignoring it in the voter intimidation case at hand.  </p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The leader of the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense says the U.S. Justice Department was right to drop a voter intimidation suit against his group because the case was weak&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is why Whites need advocacy groups to defend their group interests, just as every other group is allowed  &mdash;  THAT is the true injustice!</p>
<p>A blatant video tape of clear black-thug voter intimidation of Whites is dismissed as &#8216;weak.&rsquo;  Flashback to Florida, 2000, where there was SCANT evidence of White and/or police intimidation of black voters, only feeble accusations and hearsay. </p>
<p>Yet these weak claims elicited a six-month investigation by the US Commission on Civil Rights:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Remember the claims by John Kerry and others of one million black voters disenfranchised in Florida during the 2000 presidential election? Peter Kirsanow, a black attorney and member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, says the commission&rsquo;s six-month investigation failed to find any evidence of black voter&rsquo; &#8216;intimidation.&rsquo; &#8216;Not one person was intimidated,&rsquo; says Kirsanow, &#8216;[or] had their [sic] vote stolen. There was no disenfranchisement &hellip; no truth to any of those allegations&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yfcslz3" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yfcslz3</a></p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the US Commission on Civil Rights DEMAND an investigation by the Justice Department into clear, video-taped voter intimidation in Philadelphia?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it was just intimidation of Whites  &mdash;  something the US Commission on Civil Rights, the Justice Department and obama&rsquo;s government obviously agree with.</p>
<p>Tell everyone you know and spread the word that it&rsquo;s open season on Whites.</p>

<p>When I read the quote you quoted first, I had the same response that I have whenever prosecutors say that they can&rsquo;t charge a non-white with a hate crime rider for having committed a crime against a white, because there&rsquo;s &#8220;a lack of&#8221; or they &#8220;can&rsquo;t find any evidence.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not looking hard enough, and that&rsquo;s because the victim isn&rsquo;t an approved minority.  Therefore, they don&rsquo;t bother looking; five minutes of work by even the dumbest cop and prosecutor in the area will get you the evidence.</p>

<p>Oh, really? The guy was suspended? But if they really don&rsquo;t condone his kind of behavior, shouldn&rsquo;t they have expelled him form their group?</p>
<p>Besides, I saw an amateur video of what happened, and there were TWO Black Panthers intimidating voters, on that occasion. So what about the other one? Is he «off the hook», as I suppose they would say?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what all the fuss is about.  Intimidation of voters by ruthless, armed thugs is something that happens every day all across Africa.  It is clearly not an artifact of institutional American racism.  It is in fact part of the rich African cultural heritage.  Although Eric Holder is not really black (he appears to be an octoroon). he clearly sees the behavior of the new black panther party us just part of the rich cultural diversity of the new United States of Africa America.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;New Black Panther Party National Chairman Malik Shabazz says recent attempts to question that ruling are nothing more than a &lsquo;political witch hunt&rsquo; Republicans are waging against Attorney General Eric Holder.&rdquo; (from the full article.)</p>
<p>Some &ldquo;political witch hunt&rdquo; by the Republicans!</p>
<p>Honestly, if the situation were reversed and it was the &ldquo;White Panthers&rdquo; or some other self-styled Caucasian &ldquo;self-defense&rdquo; group who did this, the Democrats and the Marxstream media would be having a field day, to say nothing of the Malik Shabazz types in this country. I can just hear/see it now (&ldquo;We Shall Overcome&rdquo; being played softly in the background and slowly evolving into some thumping hip-hop war cry as the musical score) as they evoked the &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; of the white race and &ldquo;hateful&rdquo; America, and demanded &ldquo;justice.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Laughably and nauseatingly, a spray painted swastika or an unfortunately hung noose (often hoaxed by the terminally &ldquo;offended&rdquo; themselves) in the wrong place, is enough to practically cause a call for a national day of mourning and atonement, and legitimate governmental attempts to prevent illegal aliens and other non-citizens from voting are decried as being &ldquo;fascism&rdquo; and &ldquo;racism&rdquo; by these &ldquo;Progressive&rdquo; fanatics.  Just imagine what an uproar of sanctimonious outrage, a white guy with a nightstick at a racially mixed polling place and caught on camera would engender. For goodness sakes, I am surprised that they are not accusing the guy who filmed this incident of being a Republican &ldquo;Nazi&rdquo; or something; much like they are attempting to do, with the young couple who filmed the ACORN apparatchiks encouraging sexual slavery and pimping as legitimate enterprises.</p>
<p>The Republicans aren&rsquo;t called the stupid party without reason, and their &ldquo;alternative conservative&rdquo; magpies like Rush Limbaugh and Glen Beck aren&rsquo;t much better on this score. They are handed golden opportunities everyday by these Reds, and the most they ever do is point out the obvious, and then cover their tracks to avoid being called &ldquo;racist.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Just take a wrong turn off any interstate highway going thru downtown in any major city, do you &#8220;feel the love&#8221; and comfort of a wonderful environment?</p>
<p>You have just entered the zone of rob, rape, kill, destroy whitey.  But remember, shabbazz says it&rsquo;s fair and they are not here to intimidate.</p>
<p>In that environment you&rsquo;re only hope would be, as chris rock says, &#8220;al cracker.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>It might be a good idea if Holder did prosecute this Black Panther and give him a slap on the wrist.  I can almost practically guarantee the next administration won&rsquo;t be so generous.</p>
