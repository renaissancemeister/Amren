<h1>Obama Naming Hispanics to Top Posts at Record Pace</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Wides-Munoz, Buffalo News, December 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama is on track to name more Hispanics to top posts than any of his predecessors, drawing appointees from a wide range of the nation&rsquo;s Latino communities, including Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Colombians.</p>
<p>That won&rsquo;t necessarily give the president a free pass on issues such as immigration, but it may ease Hispanics&rsquo; worries about whether Obama will continue reaching out to a group that was key to his winning the White House.</p>
<p>{snip} In less than a year in office, the president has also tapped at least 48 other Hispanics to positions senior enough to require Senate confirmation. So far, 35 have been approved.</p>
<p>That compares with a total of 30 approved under Bill Clinton and 34 under George W. Bush during their first 20 months in office, according to U.S. Office of Personnel Management data.</p>
<p>The personnel office does not track appointments of judges or ambassadors. Early indicators suggest Obama is naming many Hispanics to those positions as well, though he has been slow to appoint judges in general.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In some ways, Obama is simply following his predecessor&rsquo;s example. Until the Obama administration, Bush&rsquo;s Cabinet was widely considered the most ethnically diverse in U.S. history, with Hispanics serving as secretaries of commerce and housing and as attorney general. Less than half of Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet consists of white men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About half of Obama&rsquo;s picks trace their roots to Mexico and the former Spanish holdings in the Southwest, not surprising since two-thirds of Hispanics in the U.S. identify themselves as Mexican-American. But the administration also includes about half a dozen people of South American descent and nearly a dozen Hispanics from the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Oddly, that geographic and international diversity may come in part from Obama&rsquo;s lack of experience in working with Hispanics, said Matt Barreto, an associate professor at the University of Washington who studies Latino politics.</p>
<p>Bush had a long history of working with Mexican-Americans in Texas and had family and political connections to the Republican-leaning Cuban-American community in Florida. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Obama&rsquo;s chief opponent during the primaries, had strong support from the Democratic Hispanic leadership in heavily Mexican-American Texas and California, and to some extent Florida. Obama didn&rsquo;t have those ties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than half of the appointees hold an Ivy League degree, and more than a quarter, like the president, have a diploma from Harvard, an Associated Press review found.</p>

		<p>This has to make Obama&rsquo;s black supporters unhappy, but what is the President to do?  Blacks will vote for him almost monolithically in big numbers in 2012 no matter what, so he doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything for them.  Hispanics, however, are a mirror constituency of whites, only lower.  What that means is if the Republican goes down in the white vote compared to four years ago, the Republican will also go down among Hispanic voters, only at a much lower percentage than whites, and vice versa, only both whites and Hispanics will vote more R, but whites still much higher than Hispanics.  Obama thinks enough Hispanics could flip so that he could lose, so he has to reward them.</p>

<p>Giant step for mankind!</p>
<p>The idiocy displayed in some of these pieces of &ldquo;journalism,&rdquo; is so astounding that suffocating (as opposed to breathtaking) is the only way to accurately describe them. Certainly the abominably genocidal ideology of multiculturalism is playing a role with General Secretary BO here, but so too are the results of the same, that has roots going back to JFK at least. This being that the country has lurched like a lobotomized zombie, from roughly 2%  Hispanic in the 1960s to about 14% or greater today. </p>
<p>Like it or not, there are more of them in this country now and there has been no significant shift in our national &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; orthodoxy. Put the two together and get &ldquo;five,&rdquo; not much of a surprise.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>I agree, but his primary reason is to make certain the majority of his people are non-white.  That not only reduces the base of the white power structure it enables the non-white leadership pf all groups to throw up a facade where it appears as if all &#8220;people of color&#8221; are united against whites.  It&rsquo;s a force multiplier.</p>
<p>The peons still hate each other, but the leadership is able to neutralize whitey&rsquo;s power somewhat.</p>
<p>Without whites every single one of these &#8220;people of color&#8221; would be tearing at each other&rsquo;s throats with reckless abandon.  They truly hate each other as much as they hate whites.</p>
<p>If things work out to where the country doesn&rsquo;t split completely apart into racial enclaves when the economy begins to go south again in 2010, then it would behoove every aware white throughout the entire nation to set up parallel societies in remote areas in order to maintain an orderly white existence.</p>
<p>Civil war or not, this country is headed for third world status, with many areas seceding.  Actually we&rsquo;re in the throes of it all right this very minute.  The empire is failing and we&rsquo;re deteriorating badly on several fronts.</p>

<p>I guess the ultimate winner will be the one who has no white males in his (or her) cabinet.</p>
<p>Anyone want to take a guess when that&rsquo;s going to happen?</p>

		<p>Is this the Old Color Boy network? Seems like it.</p>
<p>Seriously, all this affirmative action in American universities (especially the Ivy League) and the placing of Hispanics (and Blacks) in key posts, it&rsquo;s all part of a plan to disposess Whites of their country.</p>
<p>Tea parties are good, but I firmly believe White Americans should create a third national political party, since the Democrats have become pro-illegal immigrants, and the Republicans are corrupt, incompetent, and all they stand for is multiracial money making.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party and a Cuban-American, said he was impressed by Obama&rsquo;s initial Hispanic appointments, &hellip;though he said he will be watching to see whether the pace falls off&#8221;.</p>
<p>The whole article reads like &#8216;we&rsquo;re watching&rsquo;, like Obama is on some kind of dog leash. I suppose by using &#8216;we&rsquo; we&rsquo;re watching, the reporter would have us believe we stands for &#8216;all of us in the media and everyone of good moral character&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If this is what you get from diversity, from your &#8216;friends&rsquo; who needs it?</p>

		<p>Of <i>course</i> Obongo is appointing more and more Incompetent Racists of Color; that&rsquo;s to be expected.  The real danger is that doing so is well on the way to becoming a sort of presidential tradition.  Will <i>every</i> president from now on feel obligated to surround himself with mestizos and blacks, lest he appear &#8220;racist?&#8221;  We certainly can&rsquo;t expect anything better from what remains of the Republican Party   &mdash;   as the article correctly points out, Jorge Bush was little better.</p>
<p>Time for a third party, folks.<br>

		<p>Regarding my post above I read it first on this non-radical website:<br>
http://insideworkerscompny.com/blog/?cat=3</p>
<p>After I posted this poll, recently appointed Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor in one of her first rulings used the term &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;. In my poll I used the term &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; but based on the following comment I shall now use the term &ldquo;illegal immigrant&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;undocumented worker&rdquo;. Political correctness, such as it may be, is the purview of the legislature and not those involved in the law, be it civil, criminal, or administrative. The comment was:</p>
<p>    Aren&rsquo;t you glad you had an education which stressed accuracy in choice of terms? An &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; immigrant is a person who is in the US but is a citizen of another country and who, somehow, lost the papers which would demonstrate their current status. An &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; is a person whose status, after an inquiry, shows that there is nothing to support legal residency. Sotomayor&rsquo;s deliberate use of incorrect terms to cloud or mischaracterize a status does not demonstrate incompetence, it demonstrates a violation of an oath to support the laws as they are.</p>
