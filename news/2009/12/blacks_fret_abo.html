			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rohan Preston, Star Tribune (Minneapolis), December 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Can the black family catch a break in the movies?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what many African-Americans in the Twin Cities and elsewhere are asking in the wake of two recent films: the critically acclaimed &#8220;Precious&#8221; and &#8220;The Blind Side,&#8221; a No. 1 box-office hit that has grossed nearly $130 million since its Nov. 20 release.</p>
<p>o In &#8220;Precious,&#8221; based on Sapphire&rsquo;s wrenching novel &#8220;Push,&#8221; an obese, illiterate black teenager is pregnant again by her father while her also-abusive welfare-recipient mother scorns her for stealing her man.</p>
<p>o In &#8220;The Blind Side,&#8221; which stars Sandra Bullock, an illiterate, homeless black teen is taken in by a kind white family. Under their care, he blossoms into a football star.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not saying that these things don&rsquo;t happen and that they are not good movies,&#8221; said Brenda Anderson, 59, a law firm manager in Minneapolis. &#8220;It&rsquo;s just that at a time when the Obamas are in the White House, it seems like there&rsquo;s nothing [on screen] to reflect our proud reality. Instead, we have stories that show the black family as a total failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Intense emotions</b></p>
<p>The films have led to spirited discussions in the blogosphere and in real-world gathering in salons and book-club meetings. The intense emotions, especially about &#8220;Precious,&#8221; stir up long-dormant issues in the black community, in part because of the film&rsquo;s use of color-coded characters. The movie&rsquo;s victims and victimizers are dark-skinned; those offering salvation are fairer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With relatively few major motion pictures made about black life, those that are released bear an added responsibility to offer balanced portrayals of the values of a community, said Lindy Vincent, an avid moviegoer who owns Moxie Fitness, a Minneapolis-based personal-training business.</p>
<p>&#8220;These images get transported around the world and then frame a narrative of who you are,&#8221; Vincent said. &#8220;When I&rsquo;m in Shanghai or Beijing and people are eyeing me up and down, I can&rsquo;t tell you what they&rsquo;re thinking, but I don&rsquo;t want &#8216;Precious&rsquo; to be playing in their heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vincent also pointed to &#8220;Milk,&#8221; the film about the killing of gay San Francisco pol Harvey Milk, as a model. &#8220;Even though the central character is killed, there is positive, uplifting momentum at the end,&#8221; she said. &#8220;With any type of black movie these days, all we seem to be getting is stuff that&rsquo;s unrelentingly negative. At Christmastime.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Obama reality is one of corruption, lies, and political betrayal of the USA.  He is an affirmative action college grad, or why won&rsquo;t he release his records, hmmm?  If blacks want the Huxtables over their majority black criminal underclass reality maybe they should focus on the reality and not propaganda put out by the media masters of Hollywood.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;With any type of black movie these days, all we seem to be getting is stuff that&rsquo;s unrelentingly negative. At Christmastime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blacks who do not live a life of unrepentance, exaggerated pride, and self-proclaimed victimhood are generally the most impertinent and inaccurate models of black culture in the U.S. These negative images of the films are probably the most accurate depiction of black culture in the U.S. today  &mdash;  a culture involved in a constant downward descent that can only be sustained by perpetual white involvement and supervision.</p>
<p>You want positive black movies? Start living positive lifestyles. Everything else with blacks, from commercials, advertisements, and all other forms of media portrays blacks as upstanding superior people, but when a movie zones in on the reality of blacks in the U.S. in great detail it shows it unmasked and unfettered in all its depressing glory.</p>

		<p>If the radicals in the film industry truthfully depicted the black community, instead of portraying just the opposite of reality, the entire world would know blacks for what they really are, and it is a far cry from brilliant scientists, authors, police brass, and the like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how the brainwashed kids of today are picking up on the truth.  It takes them awhile, but except for a few baggy pants retards it&rsquo;s just not possible to distort black reality for very long.</p>

		<p>She should watch more television.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure from watching, particularly, ads, that all White men are bumbling fools, while all black men are suave, cool, quick-thinking sophisticates.  White men also commit all crimes in alarm commercials and in crime dramas.  And all Southern White men are drooling &#8220;cletuses&#8221; to be savaged in the most hateful way possible.  Or she could go to the movies to learn how black athletes transcended (and transcended and transcended) the barriers put in front of them by despicable White men or are doctors, scientists, presidents, and military men who save civilization (from Whites presumably).</p>
<p>Either way, the media has convinced me that blacks are superior in every way to Whites.</p>

		<p> Why are the filmmakers under any obligation to present a &#8220;balanced&#8221; picture of blacks? If the &#8220;truth&#8221; is so contrary to what these atrocious movies show, how come blacks are so heavily over-represented in prison populations, people who are HIV positive, ad nauseum?</p>
<p> And speaking of &#8220;balanced&#8221; portrayals, we have only to look at today&rsquo;s TV commercials to see not all the lack of &#8220;balance&#8221;  necessarily works against blacks. Find a commercial that shows a warm, loving, INTACT family depicted using the sponsor&rsquo;s product, and odds are extremely good that the family will be black. Find a commercial in which the father, if not altogether absent, is depicted as chubby, balding, hen-pecked, and stupid, and the wife as both beautiful and smart, and the family is almost invariably White. </p>

		<p>Those movies went to #1 (though that&rsquo;s not a huge accomplishment in today&rsquo;s movie climate, not much competition, por favor), so a lot of black had to have paid money to watch them.  If that&rsquo;s the case, then what I think appealed to them is because they can relate to the subject matter.</p>

		<p>I find the treatment of blacks by the entertainment industry has been overwhelmingly positive, usually by putting them in positions of authority like judges, policemen, lawyers, and teachers, and as sexually desirable and successful characters.  </p>
<p>Even when they show flaws, it is usually offset by showing that blacks have great moral fibre and moral leadership in spite of their station in life, it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re victims too.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why the media is compelled to show so many Black folks in advertisement these days, when they make up a small percentage of the population? Yet, there are next to no Asian or Hispanics people in ad&rsquo;s, even though they make up a larger and more wealthy part of our population? Is there a &#8220;higher power&#8221; telling the media that blacks and only blacks must be shown in a good light in order to make the blacks feel better about themselves, so they will commit less crime and not be such a burden to society? If so, how is that experiment working out?</p>

		<p>I think it is just the opposite.  Movies go out of their way to show blacks in a positive light while portraying whites as incorrigible, racist buffoons.</p>
<p>Will Smith in &#8220;I am legend&#8221; plays a hero thrown into a city of malevolent white mutants.  He not only plays the role of commando, but he is also a medical researcher who works in a makeshift lab and tries to figure out why these white mutants are so malevolent.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Snakes on a plane&#8221; Samual Jackson plays the role of brave hero that not only has to restore order on the plane full of snakes and crazy whites, but he then has to fly the plane after he restores order.</p>
<p>It goes on and on.  By the way, I didn&rsquo;t pay for these movies they are on cable HBO, etc.</p>

		<p>For years Hollywood has portrayed blacks far more sympathetically than they are in real life. Along comes this movie &#8220;Precious&#8221; which portrays actual black ghetto family life (incest, drugs, domestic violence) and some blacks are demanding an end to the realism.</p>
<p>Hollywood never would have given Precious the greenlight had white filmmakers been behind it rather than Oprah, Tyler Perry and the film&rsquo;s black director.    </p>

		<p>When I want to know something about the &#8220;proud reality&#8221; of blacks, or how they are &#8220;the central moral theme in this country,&#8221; I check out the latest news from Hip Hop Weekly and the latest mug shot postings at the Thug Report.</p>
<p>And then I wonder how many of those proud afrocultural realists and morality afrocultural themes will ever thank my White race for liberation from Africa, abolition, emancipation, unearned citizenship, the vote, equal protection, integration, affirmative action preference, food stamps, welfare, electricity, schools, teachers, hospitals, medicines, printing presses, computers, internet, jets, automobiles, homes,  commerce,etc., etc. </p>
<p>Where is the thanks that We are owed? Zebra Killings, Wichita Massacre, Knoxville Horror, Julie Love, Eve Carson, Anne Pressley, Elin Nordegren, Mark Renniger, Ronald Owens, Tina Griswold, Greg Richards&hellip;  </p>

		<p>While the theme of Blind Side is based on a real story, most intimate interaction between the two races does not end well and usually not for the White party. Consider the good White woman  somewhere in the Midwest I believe, who welcomed a NOLA family into her home after Katrina. That story ended with the woman being murdered by those whom she helped.</p>
<p>The Blacks who are troubled by the themes of these movies are either fantastically stupid or totally disingenuous. </p>

<p>I think that is a pretty accurate description of reality, really: what would Blacks be, in the US, without affirmative action, and other such things given to them by Whites?</p>
<p>Besides, an awful lot of Black movie and television characters these days, are Black males, dating White women, or married to White women&hellip; LOts of them are doctors, lawyers, world-class scientists, astronauts, etc&hellip;</p>

		<p>Articles like this are among the most preposterous and frustrating AR places here. One can only reach one conclusion from all this - apart from every other shortcoming, Blacks are also completely DELUSIONAL! </p>
<p>As many have already noted, Blacks on TV and in film are almost exclusively portrayed in a manner 100% at odds, or the opposite from reality! If someone arrived from another planet and went only by the entertainment/advertising portrayal of American Blacks, they would certainly conclude only the following:</p>
<p>1) Blacks are at least %50-60 of the population(possibly more)</p>
<p>2) Blacks live primarily in nice, clean, quiet, suburban neighborhoods, or fancy &#8220;McMansions.&#8221;</p>
<p>3) Blacks are ALWAYS the victim, NEVER th victimizer.</p>
<p>4) Blacks are nearly all employed as professionals, high-level elected officials, brilliant scientists, celebrities, police chiefs(oh, the irony), etc.</p>
<p>* There would be a noted exception, however, that would no doubt introduce a great deal of cunfusion - nightly news coverage. The fact that night after night, every murder, armed robbery, home invasion, rape, etc., is suspiciously committed by Blacks. How this squares with the entertainment/media image of Blacks would certainly baffle our alien friend, just as it does us racially aware and awakened types!<br>

		<p>LMAO, I love that &#8220;proud reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be great if people would only feel pride when they have something to be proud of!!!</p>
<p>What is this reality she&rsquo;s so &#8220;proud&#8221; of?</p>
<p>Is it the 75% dropout rate in Detroit schools?</p>
<p>Is it that there are three times as many blacks in prison than in college?</p>
<p>If these things make her proud, I&rsquo;d hate to see what would make her ashamed.</p>

		<p>Brenda, Wake up from your fantasy dream.  80% of Black children are born without a &#8220;legal&#8221; father.  In some cities, 50% of Blacks fail to graduate from HS and 50% of Black girls drop babies before they reach 21 years of age.  The media portrays Blacks 100 times as good as reality.</p>

<p>What might that be, I wonder. A film showing how Blacks TRASHED vast areas of Philadelphia since WWII. The constant street crime by Blacks. The reality even Black children can be counted on for acts of thievery and violence starting at an early age. Or perhaps the pride being based on Black criminals in modern society. The drug pushers&hellip; the whoremaster pimps&hellip; the extortion specialists, squeezing money from White owned businesses and White taxpayers over the last four or five decades.</p>

		<p>Maybe Blacks are unhappy with the ludicrous sit-com type commercials on the boob tube. Where EVERY White couple has the obligatory Black(s) as their best friend. With the Black ALWAYS shown to have the answer Whites need. Those utterly stupid commercials, not to mention the unreality displayed in Hollwood&rsquo;s &#8220;entertainment&#8221; films, where Blacks are always portrayed as better, more honest, more intelligent or braver than Whites is the biggest joke yet. Which is WHY I see Hollywood as nothing but a PROPAGANDA INDUSTRY, disseminating films who&rsquo;s primary purpose is to enhance and continue the brainwashing Americans are exposed to, from cradle to grave.</p>

<p>A few years ago in South Africa there was a report in a newspaper about the things filmed by security cameras. It&rsquo;s not the kind of things you could show on TV or family movies. The thing that surprised the reporter was the range of imaginative ways that the oblivious blacks found to relieve their sexual tensions - including a hole in the ground!</p>

		<p>A film industry that depicted an accurate image of American blacks would produce films about atrocities like the Wichita Massacre and the Knoxville Horror, about sub-literate imbeciles being admitted to universities instead of more qualified whites, about sub-literate imbeciles with meaningless university diplomas being appointed to government jobs - and once there, promoted - ahead of more qualified whites, and about historical revisionist groups who have made a national industry out of attributing to blacks art and innovation actually produced by whites.  </p>
<p>Does this &#8220;proud reality&#8221; Anderson seems to want shown to the world include any of this, or is she suggesting Hollywood produce more of the same drivel it has been foisting on the public for the last 25 years?  I&rsquo;ve got it: pyramid myths and helicopter fantasies.  Hollywood should star Brad Pitt as a nitwit Igor Sikorski, completely unable to get the world&rsquo;s first practical helicopter to work (Brad Pitt would be perfect for a role as a bumbling incompetant), until the office janitor, N&rsquo;Deshawntavious Washington, played by Danny Glover fixes everything and saves the day.  One question remains, however - how many people does Anderson really imagine are going to pay seven or eight dollars to see this dreck?</p>

 &#8220;I don&rsquo;t understand why the media [are] compelled to show so many Black folks in advertisement these days, when they make up a small percentage of the population?   Yet, there are next to no Asian or Hispanics people in ad&rsquo;s&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
Are you kidding?  No Asians/Hispanics?  I don&rsquo;t know what ads you&rsquo;ve been watching, since I hardly watch TV anymore, but  I do see ads on the Internet, plus newspaper ads and department store flyers and stuff that&rsquo;s sent me in the mail constantly.  </p>
<p>Generally, such ads have a very carefully arranged representation of every major racial type (except for  whites who are often left out or relegated to the sidelines).   White males, especially, are frequently excluded, unless  shown in a servile position such as deliveryman or handyman, though you may see a white female   &mdash;   especially if she&rsquo;s positioned next to a black male.  </p>
<p>One of this, one of  that, one of everything, that&rsquo;s how it goes    &mdash;   as if these people are all evenly represented in society in equal numbers.  Perhaps the only ones not clearly portrayed are Eskimos and Aleutian Islanders!   Construction workers, telephone linemen, as well as people in positions of executive authority are usually portrayed as <i><b>minority females. </b></i>  Ads for cruises and foreign travel will often show your &#8220;typical&#8221; successful black executive and spouse enjoying the rewards of  The Good Life.    And in ads for baby stuff, you will almost ALWAYS find the cute little black baby positioned smack dab in the center of the group.     It seems to go according to a prescribed plan, and it&rsquo;s SO glaringly obvious that it&rsquo;s embarrassing.  All sheer, social-engineering fantasy!</p>

		<p>I think the reason some blacks are foaming at the mouth about what they see as negative portrayals of them in these films is because neither picture will be up for any Oscars.</p>
<p>On the other hand, remember &#8220;Boyz in the Hood&#8221;? Its director, John Singleton, was nominated as best director, at the age of 23. That film was hailed as a gritty portrayal of gang life in L.A.</p>
<p>As to why blacks are upset, a simpler explanation will be found in this line from the song &#8220;Stand&#8221;, by Sly and the Family Stone:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand, don&rsquo;t you know that you are right,</p>

		<p>Not in the USA but typical results of towns &#8220;handed over&#8221; (using terrorism in this instance) to black administrations can be viewed with photos in South Africa.  I lived there for 24 years until &#8220;escaping&#8221; in 1999 and know very well most of the sites  shown in the photos so when I read here of US towns being destroyed I do not need a good imagination to picture them in my mind.  So sad that it is allowed to happen.</p>

<p>I remember that there was a black LAPD officer portrayed in BITH, he was shown maybe twice or three times at different parts of the movie.  He was not shy to use anti-black racial pejoratives, use your imagination.  Singleton said that he put him in the movie because it reminded him of several real life black cops.  So bad are black thugs, that they can&rsquo;t even keep their own cops away from the n-word.</p>
<p>Blacks who have authority over other blacks wind up implementing as much of the segregationist or apartheid system as they can, while denouncing whites for having done so.</p>

		<p>Ranger (#11), you&rsquo;re right about today&rsquo;s kids picking up on things the Liberal Orthodoxy wants them to be clueless about.  If you wonder what they&rsquo;re thinking, Youtube &#8216;Snakes on a Plane&rsquo; (any version, spoofed or otherwise), and read the snarky, sarcastic comments the kids are leaving.  Plenty of them have figured out the score, despite lifetimes of brainwashing.</p>
<p>But y&rsquo;all, let&rsquo;s remember and acknowledge that there are plenty of fine black families out there who are productive and well-behaved, and who appreciate and deserve our validation.  They&rsquo;re trapped between two worlds, and it won&rsquo;t hurt us to treat them with respect.</p>

		<p>Actually, the article does make a point.  There is no proud reality of blacks in movies and TV, only fanstasy.  At least 33-40% of the people I see on TV are blacks and usually portrayed as some big shot CEO, brain surgeon, rocket scientist, etc.  They come across as clumsy, awkward and unbelievable in these roles like a corn rowed gangsta at the opera would.  One positive thing that&rsquo;s come about is it forced us to cut way down on our TV time at home.  Most of our TV time is now confined to classic movies or 70s television shows on DVD. </p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen, it is usually only college-educated and upper/upper-middle class blacks who complain about portrayals like these. Most blacks seem to like films like these, probably because they can relate to them. The rich blacks seem really to be deluding themselves about the general experiences of blacks. </p>
<p>I spent several years living in a black majority area and to use the word &#8220;dysfunctional&#8221; to describe the black &#8220;family&#8221; (usually with no father in sight) is quite the understatement. One thing that I saw time and again living among black families was black mothers jerking their young children around by the hand in a violent manner, screaming at them, and frequently hitting them. Certainly, not all black mothers were like this, but it happened very often. Why haven&rsquo;t I ever seen this black reality portrayed on film? I didn&rsquo;t see white, Hispanic, or Asian mothers acting that way in public.</p>

		<p>The Flynn effect refers to the rising IQ test results over the decades.  One theorist posits that it is because of our increasing learned ability to think abstractly in all things.  This gives us a broader understanding of a problem and its solution beyond rote learning.  <br>
My understanding of the films &#8220;Precious&#8221; and &#8220;The Blindside&#8221; is there are an infinite number of ways to screw up your life, but only a few ways to succeed.  And when those few ways are followed, hard work and discipline further raise the chances of success.  But there are no guarantees.  And lastly its about the power of human will and proper attitude to overcome adversity.<br>
Unfortunately for blacks, the contrast for them is most telling and their self-proclaimed &#8220;community&#8221; is well known for self-imposed calamity through bad choices.  I pity the successful blacks as their own folks are the ones that establish the stereotypes and reputation for being bad with attitude.  But it is not my community, perhaps the successful ones can speak out against poor behavior?</p>

I have asked the question of how they feel about North American blacks and the answer is ALWAYS the same. &#8220;Yes they were discriminated and enslaved, but after the 1960&rsquo;s they have been helped. Wish I lived there. They are spoiled and have made a business out of the victim syndrome&#8221; </p>

		<p>Loved Mr Scott&rsquo;s &#8220;skid marks&#8221; term.  I&rsquo;ve used it for years for the same kind of rubbish.  The hard, cold fact that we must all remember is that each commercial is an attempt to sell something.  Most of the &#8220;sellers&#8221; are capitalists, in spite of their high-handed public posturing.  It&rsquo;s simple: note the company and the product, turn it off, go to your computer, email the company and tell you&rsquo;re offended by their pandering and that you&rsquo;re not going to buy their product or watch that program anymore.  And then, don&rsquo;t!  Companies pay attention to that stuff.  I know  &mdash;  I was in the business.  A couple thousand emails will alert the CEO, since most of them are now hooked to the complaint line to recieve what we called &#8220;exception notices&#8221;.  A 5%-10% sales effect will trash political correctness on the spot!! <br>
By the way, I lived in the Twin Cities for 25 years; and that kind of article is standard fare in the &#8220;Kwaansa Tribune&#8221;. </p>
