<h1>Scholarship Program Aims to Curb Dropout Rate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WBT-AM (Charlotte), December 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About half of a $4.5 million gift to North Carolina&rsquo;s largest public school district is creating a scholarship program for black males at a low-performing high school with a high dropout rate.</p>
<p>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools officials announced the donation Wednesday from the C.D. Spangler Foundation.</p>
<p>C.D. Spangler Jr. says he hopes to improve graduation rates at West Charlotte High School, his two daughters&rsquo; alma mater.</p>
<p>Black males graduating from the school will receive $1,000 scholarships to any University of North Carolina campus or Central Piedmont Community College, which will share $2&nbsp;million for the program.</p>
<p>West Charlotte also received $50,000 to pay college application fees of all students, and $150,000 for dropout prevention.<br>

		<p>The only three ways to accomplish this goal is to:  (1)  Reduce academic standards so far down that high school is indistinguishable from third grade,  (2)  Raise the standards, or at least pretend do, and do everything possible to give blacks diplomas even as they appear to meet the standards, or (3)  Give everyone a hs diploma as a civil right of his or her turning 18 years old, even if he or she has not earned it.</p>
<p>That way, all the &#8220;problems&#8221; we&rsquo;re told result from a high percentage of high school dropouts will magically disappear, right?  No more crime or poverty.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not a drop in the bucket compared to the overall cost.</p>
<p>Too, blacks are NOT going to bother to work toward paying their way through subjects they cant understand.</p>
<p>When are these fools going to learn, money is not a replacement for a brain.  And, getting a worthless piece of paper they can barely read means only that they received a worthless piece of paper.</p>
<p>Of course, any black male receiving one who isn&rsquo;t a millionaire in two years or in a high paying position soon after graduation  will deduce that it is oppression and racism from the ENTIRE white community that is working against his brilliant self and will be looking for paybacks every chance he gets.</p>
<p>And the victims will have the naive fool C.D. Spangler Jr to thank for their suffering.  Too bad the black, anti-white haters  can&rsquo;t all reclocate to his neighborhood.</p>

		<p>Spangler should have heeded the advice of the world&rsquo;s richest man. When asked about the Gate&rsquo;s Foundation, Carlos Slim responded,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our concept is more to accomplish and solve things, rather than giving; that is, not going around like Santa Claus&hellip;. Poverty isn&rsquo;t solved with donations.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>This does not sound too legal to me but that never stopped anything where trying to increase the collective IQ of Blacks goes. I think that someone needs to sue since these kinds of &#8220;scholarship&#8221; programs specifically targeting blacks are running rampant. Unless it is private money then race based scholarships should be banned. Even with private money try starting a scholarship fund for a needy and well deserving White student and see what happens. I stopped eating at McDonalds years ago when I saw that they gave out scholarships for minority children. I wrote the company and explained why I was not going to eat there anymore. I stopped seeing the ads but am sure that the minority only scholarships are still given out by McDonalds and other businesses. </p>

		<p>Where is the logic in this funding? Do these people REALLY think that lack of college money is the reason black males drop out of High School? They don&rsquo;t even want to be bothered with a basic education, much less higher education. This is just silly.</p>
<p>And what will they do with this 150,000 for dropout prevention? How does one &#8220;prevent&#8221; another from dropping out? They certainly can&rsquo;t buy them the intellect or desire to graduate, and that is the real issue here although they will never admit it. This ridiculous attempt at bribery will not work. They should have plenty of money left to try the next waste of time and effort.  </p>

		<p>This was finals week at the college where I teach. This past month I have had five discussions with black students in which they try to bully me into giving them a D in the course.  They argue that they have to have a D to keep their scholarship money; and/or grant money; and/or athletic team membership.  Five.  Yep, we do a great job of getting these students to college.  Now what?</p>

Never heard of Clemmie Spangler Jr.,  and so I was curious. I wondered, frankly, if he was black.  No, he&rsquo;s not.  But he&rsquo;s extremely rich (inherited money), and owns 32 million shares of Bank of America, among many other major investments.    He&rsquo;s listed as 130th richest American on Forbes list of 400.  Since he&rsquo;s about  77, his daughters must have attended that high school many years ago.  I imagine it&rsquo;s &#8220;changed&#8221; quite a bit since then.  His heart seems to be in the right place, if not his brain. He&rsquo;s throwing money at social problems, trying to fix them that way; but then, after all, money is all he has.</p>

		<p>a little off topic, but I saw a report where black co-ed&rsquo;s were using their (our) college aid money to bail their boo&rsquo;s out of jail, among other trivial non-educational uses</p>

		<p>&#8220;West Charlotte also received $50,000 to pay college application fees of all students, and $150,000 for dropout prevention.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to this, there is a 3 to 1 balance (75%) of students who &#8220;dropout&#8221;, as opposed to applying for college.  If three quarters of your fellow classmates are dropping out, what are your chances for impressing a college admissions paper jockey?  That&rsquo;s one hell of a Bell Curve.</p>

		<p>Joe gets his scholarship money.  This is money that he hasn&rsquo;t had to work for.  Joe has a math class where the teacher is writing too fast and getting common denominators.  </p>
<p>Joe can&rsquo;t ever, not one day, make it to school on time because everything else in his life seems to be more important than this confusing math class.  His car won&rsquo;t start.  He has family problems.</p>
<p>About 3/4ths of the way through the semester it starts to dawn on Joe that this nice teacher might not give him a passing grade.  This is when Joe starts staying after class to tell the teacher how much he likes her and how important it is that he passes the class.  The nice teacher tells Joe that his grade will be based only on his performance on the math tests.  Joe doesn&rsquo;t really believe this.  About three weeks from the end of the semester Joe begins to come to class on time.  The teacher praises him for this great achievement.  About a week or so before the end of the semester Joe spends a few hours studying.  Joe talks to the teacher about getting a tutor for the class but doesn&rsquo;t follow through.</p>
<p>Joe fails the final.  Joe fails the class.  Joe blames the teacher.</p>

		<p>I always have to laugh  &mdash;  about a week before the end of term, some students (always black), come to me to ask for &#8220;make-up work&#8221;. My response usually shocks them.</p>
