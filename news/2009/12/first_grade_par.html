<h1>First Grade Parents Shocked by Teacher&rsquo;s Assistant Caught on Tape</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rebecca Powers, WLOX-TV (Biloxi, Mississippi), December 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>So, they put a tape recorder in his book bag to hear what goes on in his first grade class.</p>
<p>The parents said that was on December 10th. When the recording was brought home that night, the Stablers were shocked to hear how assistant teacher Mershelia Williams spoke to the small children. They say her tone and grammar were deplorable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Williams: &#8220;Where this go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Child: &#8220;I colored that yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Williams: &#8220;It shouldn&rsquo;t of got changed at all, that ain&rsquo;t nothing to be proud of.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few seconds later, a child the Stablers identified as Makayla Massey could be heard asking for help on an assignment.</p>
<p>Makayla: &#8220;Ms. Williams, I don&rsquo;t know how to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Williams: &#8220;Go sit down, I&rsquo;m working right now, you&rsquo;re not gonna be walking up to me every 5 minutes asking me, telling me you don&rsquo;t know how to do something.&#8221;</p>
<p>In front of her, to the class, Ms Williams is overheard taking to another child about Maykala.</p>
<p>Ms. Williams: &#8220;No, do your work. She ain&rsquo;t goin to be sittin up in here wanting somebody to help her every time she, cause she don&rsquo;t wanna apply herself to her work. You know how to go in that cafeteria and enjoy that lunch and breakfast every morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the tape hidden in Gabe&rsquo;s book bag, with 15 first graders in one room, they are surprisingly quiet enough for you to hear Ms. Williams speaking. The Stablers say it&rsquo;s because they are terrified instead of nurtured.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And all of this is in the first 28 and a half minutes of school. As the Stablers continued listening to the tape, they recognized the voice of their son Gabe, who is hard of hearing. He was asking for instructions on a work sheet.</p>
<p>Gabe: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know what to do on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Williams: &#8220;Well, you&rsquo;d better find out. It&rsquo;s not hard. Nobody else didn&rsquo;t have to ask no questions bout it. You know what to do, you just want somebody to just sit there and pet you about it, but I ain&rsquo;t gonna do it. You know how to go in that lunch room and tear that food up every day. Ain&rsquo;t nothing hard bout that sheet.&#8221;</p>
<p>A holiday and dates worksheet seemed to have many of the first graders stumped.</p>
<p>This is what the teaching assistant is heard saying to two children who didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Ms. Williams: &#8220;You gotta put all these dates on here on that side. The dates don&rsquo;t go over here, this is holidays. And this is dates! Holidays! Dates! If it&rsquo;s a holiday it goes over here, if it&rsquo;s a date it goes over here. And all the lines need to be filled. Why is that so, why is that so difficult?&#8221;</p>
<p>The tape indicates one child apparently didn&rsquo;t understand what the words he was copying meant. This is what he was told.</p>
<p>Ms. Williams: &#8220;You don&rsquo;t need to know what it say. Just write it on the line&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Stablers said they were told by school officials, Ms. Williams was placed on leave with pay during an investigation that started December 11th.</p>
<p>On December 18th, the teaching assistant confirmed she was called into the school district office and fired.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before this story aired, Ms. Williams came to the WLOX Studios and listened to the tape. Wednesday morning, her attorney Alvin Chase also listened to the recording. They both emphasized that until this incident, Ms. Williams had never been reprimanded by the Biloxi School District and gave this statement.</p>

		<p>Hey, us White Nationalists are always complaining about how our youngsters are wimps and want to &#8220;prove&#8221; they are not &#8220;racist&#8221; right? Well, this is good for them it will toughen them up for the life ahead of them. Situations where they are denied a job because they are White or when there is no food in the refrigirator becaus ethe economy has collapsed. Life is tough, it&rsquo;s better they learn now.</p>

<p>Most likely because until now, nobody had thought to covertly tape record her in action!<br>
Also, the school states that she had not previously been REPRIMANDED by the school. That&rsquo;s not quite the same as saying she hasn&rsquo;t previously had complaints lodged against her.</p>

		<p>Interesting. This reminds me that just after the end of segregated schools in our country, most black teachers all over the country lost their jobs because they couldn&rsquo;t pass the state exams that exited at the time.</p>
<p>Of course, all these years later, they&rsquo;ve downgraded all standards to create the illusion that blacks can do the job. Now and then, someone does something like this and tapes one of these incompetants and get&rsquo;s them fired. but this is the extreme exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>At some point, this house of cards that has been built by the federal govt. that says no mater a minorities qualifications or lack thereof, they must be hired will fall of it&rsquo;s own weight.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even have to do anything. It&rsquo;s all falling apart by itself.</p>

&#8220;Rebecca and Mark Stabler say their 8-year-old son Gabe has come home from Jeff Davis Elementary in tears every day since school began in August&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;m sorry the poor kid had to go through this but it was worth it, if Gabe (and the other White children in the class) take the lesson to heart and LEARN what blacks are really like.  At least these kids didn&rsquo;t have to die to obtain the knowledge.  A lot of other White people have not been so lucky&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Hatred of Whites mixed with incompetence. I am sure that this is not an isolated case.  Black teachers will need to start doing searches &amp; seizures of first graders&rsquo; backpacks to make sure that there is no taped evidence against them.</p>

		<p> No picture of Mershelia Williams, I notice. However, the station wasn&rsquo;t fooling anybody by trying to keep her race a secret. &#8220;Mershelia&#8221; sounds like one of those manufactured names blacks seem to be so fond of, and &#8220;Williams&#8221; has to be one of the most common family names among American blacks. What she said on the tape pretty much wraps it up.</p>
<p> My only question would be, who hired this diamond in the rough, and how can the people of that school district make sure that that person, or persons, are terminated too, for incompetency?</p>

		<p>With the passage of the health care bill, this is an indication of the qualifications of non-white doctors of the near future, especially blacks, who will be processed through the system devoid of any real qualifications.</p>
<p>Many deaths and injuries are going to occur, if the system doesn&rsquo;t explode into out of control rioting by then.</p>
<p>Ironically, the only thing that will prevent chaos is for another form of chaos to occur.</p>

<p>These white parents just don&rsquo;t understand black teaching styles, and they are trying to &#8220;impose&#8221; their own narrow-minded, constricted white standards on black culture. I hear black parents all the time talking like this to their children in the grocery store. This is just the black style of speaking to children. These narrow-minded whites have got to learn to respect ebonics.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to recall that the NAACP had the Amos n Andy Show removed from TV because of the characters&rsquo; &#8220;stereotypical&#8221; speech patterns.</p>
<p>But how could it be called a stereotype when the overwhelming majority of blacks have always spoken that way?</p>

		<p>The part about the students being told to copy the words instead of comprehend them is what gets me.  In first grade, they should be learning how to read.  This teacher doesn&rsquo;t seem to be doing that   &mdash;   all her classroom is is overglorified day care.</p>
<p>Her class is probably mostly black, so it&rsquo;s not as if they&rsquo;re missing much in the way of academics.  Since they&rsquo;re in the age rage when their brains are developing faster than white children&rsquo;s brains, they might do a little better in the first grade with a good teacher, but it will all level off by the fourth grade.</p>

		<p>Having grown up in the Deep South and attended public school, I can assure you that this occurs throughout Dixie and most likely the whole united States on a daily basis.  I had many incompetent black teachers.  One in particular began my 6th grade year as our spelling teacher.  I was in the &#8220;top&#8221; section.  Her language and speech were so unintelligible that many straight A students failed her tests for lack of understanding her speech/ebonics.  Eventually, my class (which was high performing and only with one or two black children that were put in the class so it would not be all white) started spelling the words phonetically the way she pronounced them.  Once the second semester started, our spelling instruction was given to a white English teacher.  Order restored.  </p>

When I think I&rsquo;ve heard it all and nothing can shock me, I get slapped back to reality.</p>
<p>There are things that adults do by choice. Then there are kids who are innocent victims.</p>
<p>Nothing ticks me off more than adults who don&rsquo;t help a child when the child asks for help. That is inexcusable in my book.</p>
<p>This women shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed near children and she should be sterilized.</p>
<p>About clandestine recordings.</p>
<p>In my neighborhood, I have gotten 3 drug dealers arrested by taking photographs with a small camera strategically held in my hand and giving the photos to the police. </p>
<p>In this article, the problem was the teacher and secret recordings were the answer. My suggestion to any teachers out there who is having trouble with a child is to set up your own surveillance system. Cameras and memory are cheap.</p>
<p>Just dont&rsquo; get caught or talk about it. Just do it without anyone knowing. Only use the evidence when your back is against the wall.</p>
<p>I wish I had a recording going today when a black female co-worker went on a rant that &#8216;Arabs shouldn&rsquo;t even be here!&rsquo;<br>

		<p>She was reprimanded THIS time only because she was caught on tape and neither the school or herself could deny, equivocate, nor lie about it.  The facts were right there and indisputable.  Before that, it was a kid&rsquo;s word against hers.  The undercurrent is that this black teacher was just plain lazy and did not want to be bothered with actually doing her job.  After all, it was an affirmative action appointment, and they all know it was entitled to them, right?</p>

		<p>Do I gather that it&rsquo;s legal in Mississippi to record a person without their permission?  If so, then they ought to start filming the behavior of the brats and make their parents watch.  <br>
       As for the woman&rsquo;s grammar, t&rsquo;aint no big deal.  I often speak in my parent&rsquo;s rural idiom in the class.  If I can put up with foreign accents, students can put up with real American vernacular, including Southern Black speech.    <br>
       Anyone who&rsquo;s shocked by this woman&rsquo;s &#8220;harshness&#8221; hasn&rsquo;t dealt much with Black students or teachers.<br>
     Are these parents Yankees?</p>

		<p>Sounds like mershelia has &#8220;that&#8221; attitude towards whites. Pretty common from the mershelia&rsquo;s of the world. Personally I would never allow a black to be my child&rsquo;s teacher, doctor, nanny or anything else you care to name. For those who see this as ok, I would suggest at a MINIMUM, that you check on things ocasionally to assure that your child isnt being abused by a mersheila. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.You know how to go in that cafeteria and enjoy that lunch and breakfast every morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was left out in the above article, is this quote was directed towards a child that had a weight problem. If you even look at a black in a perceived disrespectful manner, you can literally be ruined. And here this black jerk makes fun of an overweight white child in front of a whole classroom.</p>
<p>As far as this woman being removed from the classroom, my only question here is what took so long? Apparently this abuse has been going on for the better part of 5 months. I dont think its too much of a stretch to assume that all these kids came home as miserable and upset as the Stabler boy, on a routine basis. Why did it take until recently for a parent to search for the reason why?? Probably political correctness. Any complaining parent could well have been branded a racist, not that that should stop them. </p>

		<p>Many years ago, when my son was bused to the inner city for middle school, I went to a parents&rsquo; night presentation.  After a warm welcome from the black principal, these are events where parents move from classroom to classroom following the schedule that their children follow.  Most of those attending were whites from the suburbs; they care about education.  These were poor and middle-class whites, of course, since the wealthier ones put their children in private schools or moved to better school districts.  </p>
<p>I will never forget a black male social science teacher obviously struggling repeatedly for rhetorical control to say &#8220;he doesn&rsquo;t&#8221; instead of &#8220;he don&rsquo;t.&#8221;   On the other hand, one old black English teacher spoke flawless, middle-class American English.  She had a reputation for severity because she demanded excellence from all students in diction, grammar and composition.  As part of the integration plan, the following year she was sent an hour&rsquo;s drive to the suburbs.  She was told she would be there indefinitely.  Having gone into teaching in the inner city to improve the lot of other blacks, and being denied that, she retired.</p>
<p>Who passed this teaching assistant through the class observations required for teachers and assistants?  <br>

<p>many teachers remain for decades at full salary (60K +) while failing the (NOT very demanding!!) exam year after year.</p>

		<p>This backward step can only succeed if the other parents do not take any action and ignore the effects when their children come home unable to speak English correctly.  Such teachers disqualify themselves but action needs to be taken by insisting on the correct standards, before they are employed, with the chool administrations and this cannot be construed as racist as it is an educational necessity.  Perhaps an address to parents on a specified subject in the school halls by all suitable applicants would be in order.</p>
<p>Publicise this case at local levels everywhere especially in your schools.  It would be a crime not to for your childrens&rsquo; sakes.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;When I think I&rsquo;ve heard it all and nothing can shock me, I get slapped back to reality&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Buffalo:</p>
<p>We older, more astute White teachers have been aware of this typical classroom situation for three decades now.  Unfortunately, the msm, the ones that support and promote AA (for your workplace, not theirs) refuse to report on the reality of unqualified non-Whites in the workplace and the harm they inflict, especially in the schools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had several aides just like this assigned to me and there was nothing I could do about it without fearing for my job.  So instead of &#8220;teachers&rsquo; assistants&#8221; I used them for security  &mdash;  they could speak to the miscreants in the room in language I could not use and escort them out when necessary.  I in turn, knowing about black ego, treated the aides with utmost respect and insisted that the &#8216;students&rsquo; do so as well. It worked beautifully  &mdash;  the aides instilled more fear than I ever could.  </p>
<p>Now are you getting the idea that the educational-industrial complex is primarily a job market for unqualified, uneducated blacks?  Nepotism also runs rampant in these situations and once a black is in an administrative position, he will pull in any and all of his unemployed relatives, qualified or not. </p>
<p>An audit of a local black district a few years ago produced many black employees, relatives of those in charge, who had been collecting paychecks for years without ever having set foot on school district property. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high time the public became more aware.  </p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Shouldn&rsquo;t there be a basic civil service test for teacher&rsquo;s aids to weed out the most illiterate? oh wait, that would be discrimination&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not kidding when I tell you the teachers&rsquo; tests have been completely dumbed down to the point of idiocy  &mdash;  the actual tests, not what the public sees in the study guides or biased newspapers.</p>
<p>You can bet every &#8216;education-reform&rsquo; politician knows the following story from mercenary Dick Morris:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; In Arkansas, Hillary was the head of Governor Bill Clinton&rsquo;s education reform effort. The Arkansas schools were a mess, registering at the bottom of the nation&rsquo;s educational ladder. </p>
<p> Hillary&rsquo;s team developed a program to test all Arkansas teachers as to their basic knowledge and skills&hellip; If they still could not demonstrate basic skills (after two years), they would be discharged.</p>
<p>Hillary&rsquo;s education reform plan received widespread support from parents around the state. </p>
<p>When the test results were tabulated, a large percentage of the teachers had failed. </p>
<p>&#8216;It was a disaster,&rsquo; Clinton said. &#8216;It was way too high. If I enforced the passing grade, I&rsquo;d have to flunk a third or a half of them. I can&rsquo;t do that. We&rsquo;d particularly have to fire a high percentage of minority teachers.&rsquo;</p>
<p> As Clinton had said to Morris, &#8216;I can decide what score is passing and what is failing.&rsquo; &hellip; When the Clinton Administration released the &#8216;results&rsquo; of the tests to the public, they reported that only 10% had failed instead of the 30-50% that had actually failed. In the end, only a handful of Arkansas&rsquo;s incompetent teachers lost their jobs&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/ykyudoh</p>
<p>This is how unqualified, poorly educated, non-White teachers are deemed qualified by NCLB mandates and hired for life to &#8216;teach&rsquo; the nation&rsquo;s children.</p>

		<p>Black teachers definately have a style all their own, and they can get away with things that no white teacher ever could.  I have had working experience with four black teachers over the last four years.  (This in NYC where 1/3 of the population is black, but there are almost no black teachers.  go figure!)</p>
<p>Of the four:</p>
<p>#1 was a young woman educated in the suburbs, and except for a like of hip hop and a needy clingingness to the idea of finding the ideal black man, she was pretty much okay, that is if you excuse her universal lack of content knowledge.</p>
<p>#2 was an older woman in her fifties.  She taught English class and we shared a classroom.  She was so anti-white, pro-down with the man that I felt physically uncomfortable teaching the class after her class was over.  Everything was whitey is bad, minorities are good and hekd back by others. She used to shout at the students and &#8220;give them what for&#8221; so ruthlessly that you could here her yelling clear down the hall.  No white teacher could do that without getting fired and we all knew it.  The new AA black principal wouldn&rsquo;t even touch her, though the kids were a wreck.</p>
<p>#3 This is a Haitian immigrant girl who has the full range of black &#8216;tude and cusses with a liberalism that would make sailor&rsquo;s blush.  The head rolling, eye-popping, posturing - it&rsquo;s all there.  No one can touch her &#8216;cause she black.</p>
<p>#4 This is the only black male teacher I have ever seen.  He also was raised in the suburbs so speaks correctly and fancies himself some kind of avant gard kind of dude.  He is, however, also prone to abundant cussing and also makes flagrant and flamboyant sexual remarks, especially of the gay kind.  Guess what, no one can touch him.</p>
<p>I have not yet me a black teacher who is culturally similar to a typical, mild-mannered middle class person and who is competent in their subject matter.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry the poor kid had to go through this but it was worth it, if Gabe (and the other White children in the class) take the lesson to heart and LEARN what blacks are really like. At least these kids didn&rsquo;t have to die to obtain the knowledge. A lot of other White people have not been so lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
But judging by how so many other cases go (and far worse ones, too), it&rsquo;s far more likely that the parents will be insisting till they&rsquo;re blue in the face that&hellip; &#8220;race had nothing to do with it&#8221;.</p>

With the passage of the health care bill, this is an indication of the qualifications of non-white doctors of the near future, especially blacks, who will be processed through the system devoid of any real qualifications.</p>
<p>Many deaths and injuries are going to occur, if the system doesn&rsquo;t explode into out of control rioting by then.</p>
<p>Ironically, the only thing that will prevent chaos is for another form of chaos to occur.</p>
<p><br>
Absolutely!</p>
<p>And not just Black, but Hispanic.</p>
<p>Their cultures are anti-education. <br>
But, I have to say it, many Whites, from all social classes, who demand more of themselves than from others, often complained one hundred years ago, that our Middle Class wanted standards lowered and sneared at &#8220;High Culture&#8221; with the usual stupid envy the Middle Class are famous for.  Then the Working class Whites did the same to the Middle Class.  <br>
The result?<br>
The disappearance of High Culture.<br>
THIS paved the way for the PC elites and the end of the West as we know it.<br>
Until Whites own up to this we will never - ever - in a million years - turn things around.<br>
And, in case anyone isn&rsquo;t paying attention, we don&rsquo;t HAVE a million years.<br>
Our fate will be decided before the end of BO&rsquo;s first term.</p>
