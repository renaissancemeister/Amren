<h1>Black-White Turnout Key in Atlanta Mayoral Runoff</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, November 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just a few weeks ago, Atlanta looked ready to elect its first white mayor in a generation. Instead, the Nov. 3 election set up a hard-fought runoff battle that&rsquo;s expected to break down largely along racial lines when voters return to the polls Tuesday.</p>
<p>White councilwoman Mary Norwood and former state Sen. Kasim Reed, who is black, are vying for racial crossover votes. Experts say victory likely hinges on black-versus-white turnout.</p>
<p>Early voting suggests strong turnout in Norwood&rsquo;s stronghold on the city&rsquo;s mostly white north side. Voters there were outpacing the heavily black southside by a third.</p>
<p>Political observers have the candidates tied.<br>

		<p>I predict a Reed victory.  Blacks won&rsquo;t let go of the Mayor&rsquo;s office in the premier city of the South, home of MLK and many others.  The symbolism is just too important to them.</p>

		<p>Reed is getting plenty of White votes&hellip;as is the predictable pattern&hellip;but Norwood is not expected to get many Black votes&hellip;as is the predictable pattern.</p>
<p>Reed is perhaps the finest example of the inept, inarticulate, and malfeasant politician that has been the hallmark of Black rule in Atlanta&hellip;what is left of this fair city will be utterly destroyed by him and his minions.</p>

<p>Atlanta is 2/3 black. </p>
<p>For predicting the outcome of this runoff, that&rsquo;s really all you need to know. </p>

		<p>Blacks generally don&rsquo;t turn out for elections in the numbers predicted - I suspect a Norwood win because of a larger white turn out as both a backlash against corrupt black rule and whites lying to pollsters to not appear racist. </p>

		<p>Reed will win Atlanta, and what a blessing for Norwood when he does. If she wins, she is the minority white race mayor of a majority African American city that is following Detriot&rsquo;s slide into chaos. Incompetence, mismanagement, corruption, unearned African American race privilege, all the ills that were predicted by our Southern wise men and Carleton Putnam have already come true in Atlanta. Norwood won&rsquo;t turn the tide, because to do so, she would have to become that &#8220;racist white mayor of Atlanta who fires too many blacks.&#8221; She bragged about voting for Obama, so won&rsquo;t do that which is necessary. As mayor, she&rsquo;ll just try to make the best of a bad situation and keep her supporters happy with her efforts. Results will be impossible. Thomas Dixon told us that, and the stereotypes appear committed to proving him right. If she does win, the racialists will have a grand time watching the daily awareness raising headlines announcing the latest outrage at her policies that are &#8220;racist and mean spirited.&#8221; White Atlanta may finally awaken upon the attacks on their white mayor. But Reed will win, and Atlanta will just become Detroit all the faster, and likewise all the faster will it become less white. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read that Atlanta is becoming gentrified to the tune of about 40% white.  Many upper-middle-class blacks there also fear that their city is going the way of Detroit, and most surely realize that the only way to prevent that is to get rid of the corrupt black infrastructure that has resulted in a partial shut-down of city services and less cops on the beat.  Otherwise, Atlanta will become Detroit South  &mdash;  and they know it.  At least there&rsquo;s still a ray of hope!</p>

		<p>Just when, I ask, has a majority black city, town, district, country, et al ever elected a white to head an office? Never has, never will. Whites do not have enough sense to stick together even when it means their survival. I live 20 miles from Atlanta. My entire family fled what was once a fine beautiful southern city Atlanta. We all live now in surrounding cities and seldom ever venture into crime ridden Atlanta. My county is only 7 percent black but under federal guide lines my voting district was redrawn to include heavily black populated areas of Metro Atlanta and so now I have a black racist congressman &#8220;representing&#8221; me, not. And so goes America. </p>

		<p>It looks like Reed will win.  And I think that&rsquo;s a good thing, because it will validate the us-versus-them or I-It paradigm espoused by future white nationalist politicians.  In other words, it will be harder for the establishment to denounce a white nationalist&rsquo;s us-them campaigning when it works for blacks who do it.</p>
