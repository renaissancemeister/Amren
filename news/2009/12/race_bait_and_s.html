<h1>Race Bait and Switch</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Devin Burghart, TPMCafe (Talking Points Magazine), December 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ferris State University [in Michigan] was in the process of planning a debate on immigration policy scheduled for the spring of 2010. They&rsquo;d already lined up a local immigration attorney, to represent the &#8220;liberal&#8221; side in the debate. To find a representative of the &#8220;conservative&#8221; position, a faculty member contacted The Social Contract Press  &mdash;  the anti-immigration publishing house headquartered just up the road in Petoskey  &mdash;  requesting a speaker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a letter dated September 21, 2009, TSC editor Wayne Lutton replied to the Ferris State request made by Dr. Barry Mehler, &#8220;I have travel plans for the Spring and can not[sp] commit to any programs at this time. Jared Taylor, of American Renaissance, would be pleased to debate Mr. Kessler or yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} American Renaissance first described itself as a &#8220;literate, undeceived journal of race, immigration and the decline of civility.&#8221; It claimed that &#8220;White people&#8221; had lost their voice and that the United States was in danger of losing its &#8220;national and cultural core.&#8221; Capturing the centrality of anti-immigration activism to white nationalism, Taylor wrote in a 2001 AR piece that,<blockquote>Undoubtedly the greatest threat to whites today comes from immigration. Racial preferences, guilt-mongering, anti-Western education, even anti-white violence are manageable problems compared to a process that is displacing whites and reducing them to a minority. With a change in thinking at the right levels, anti-white policies and double standards could be done away with practically overnight, but that would still leave us with nearly 100 million non-whites living in the country.<br>
</blockquote>Taylor has enjoyed using university events like this to promote American Renaissance, legitimize himself, and bask in the attention created by the campus controversies that ensue when racists have a platform. {snip}</p>
<p>Lutton describes himself as a &#8220;right-wing green&#8221; to camouflage his decades of white nationalist activism. Far from being a conservative environmentalist, Lutton has a long-standing relationship with Jared Taylor and his white nationalist group American Renaissance. For instance, Lutton spoke at the first two conferences of American Renaissance in 1994 and 1996 and is scheduled to speak at the 2010 AR conference next February. He also serves as a trustee of the American Renaissance&rsquo;s parent organization the New Century Foundation.</p>
<p>Lutton and Taylor have also worked together in other white nationalist organizations. Lutton was a senior fellow at the white nationalist think-tank, the National Policy Institute, where Taylor was a board member. They&rsquo;ve been editorial advisors to the Council of Conservative Citizen&rsquo;s publication, the Citizen Informer. The two sat together on the editorial advisory board of the racist and anti-Semitic journal, The Occidental Quarterly, while the editor was Lutton&rsquo;s TSC colleague Kevin Lamb.</p>
<p>{snip} The relationship between The Social Contract and American Renaissance goes both ways. Jared Taylor has written for The Social Contract, first as a letter-writer, then a full-fledged contributor. Taylor attended TSC founder John Tanton&rsquo;s exclusive WITAN meetings, the controversial gatherings of hand-picked attendees which took the name from an Old English term, witenagemot, or council of wise men. At Taylor&rsquo;s request, Tanton even provided early input on the direction of American Renaissance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wisely, Ferris State University didn&rsquo;t take the bait. The university chose not to extend an invitation to Taylor. As the immigration issue once again starts working its way to the fore, the experience is a reminder to colleges, universities, and other organizations (including media outlets), to take a much closer look at nativist leaders.<br>

		<p>Barry Mehler is a longtime leftist McCarthyite who &#8220;monitors hate groups.&#8221; Of course, any group that speaks for white people will be labeled a hate group by this fanatic. No black supremacist group will come under the microscope of this lunatic.</p>
<p>Yet he pretends that he was just looking for a conservative speaker and frighteningly stumbled upon Wayne Lutton and Jared Taylor.</p>

		<p>How sickeningly typical; they accuse a person of being a &#8220;racist&#8221; but they neglect to even define what a &#8220;racist&#8221; is.  Instead, they use a bizarre sort of &#8220;ping-pong guilt by association&#8221;.  Lutton is a &#8220;racist&#8221; because he associates with Taylor.  As for Taylor, he&rsquo;s a &#8220;racist&#8221; because he associates with Lutton.  Both are &#8220;racist&#8221; because they associate with the COCC.  Why is the COCC &#8220;racist&#8221;?  Surely because they associate with the likes of Taylor and Lutton.  They do provide a quote from Taylor - which shows love and concern for the White Race - but no signs of hatred for other races.  Would it be racist to express similar concerns for other races?  More likely, this would be an example of the &#8220;double standards&#8221; mentioned by the self-same article.</p>

		<p>If Mr Taylor is the ordinary mean ole racist that the writer is making him out to be, then the leftist he was to debate on immigration could have made easy work of him. Im not buying it. A more likely scenario is that the decision makers looked into Mr Taylor and discovered that he would likely mop up the floor with the immigration attorney scheduled to debate. </p>
<p>These leftists dont want a debate. They want a hard core immigration sympathizer and a moderate on immigration to debate. But what would you expect from one of our liberal institutions of higher learning&hellip;..Hey Ferris State&hellip;Thanks for showing us what you are all about. But it wasnt really nessessary. We already knew. </p>

		<p>Good luck finding someone worthy who isn&rsquo;t both anti-immigration and white nationalist.   </p>
<p>The argument against immigration is environmental, economic, and racial-cultural.  </p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find someone who understands the first two, but intellectually shields themself from the over-arching racial question.</p>

		<p>Thanks heavens the renown Ferris State University had the good sense not to invite Jared Taylor to speak at their esteemed institution of higher learning.</p>
<p>After all, we can&rsquo;t have Taylor&rsquo;s pernicious theories about race poisoning the sanitized learning experience for which Ferris State is justly celebrated. </p>
<p>Of late it&rsquo;s been rumored that some of FS&rsquo;s students (a tiny minority, of course) even secretly harbor the view that all races are not absolutely identical, the nonsensical notion that East Asians and Mestizos are, on average, smaller than caucasians, or that they all have brown eyes! Recently one radical student was even found in possession of one of Dr. Arthur Jensen&rsquo;s books on genetics and human intelligence.</p>
<p>Clearly, this sort of dangerously radical thinking has no place in any institution of higher learning which prizes, above all else, the free and open exchange of ideas.</p>

		<p>This has nothing to do with racism. They don&rsquo;t want Jared Taylor to make them look like fools in this debate, which he most certainly will do. They simply don&rsquo;t know how to deal with someone like Mr. Taylor. When he doesn&rsquo;t show up in a hooded white sheet shouting hail Hitler, but actually sits down and has an intelligent discussion about immigration, it lets these students see his valid points, and that just maybe we are not all a bunch of lunitics. </p>

		<p>Ferris State has an &#8220;Institute on Academic Racism,&#8221; whose claim to fame is bashing and trashing any white people above the third standard deviation in IQ who have the temerity to think that the races of humanity aren&rsquo;t fundamentally equal.  I get the feeling that they knew all along who Wayne Lutton is, so they invited him just to stir up the left wing in their own midsts.</p>

		<p>These folks always inarticulately tack on the &#8220;racist&#8221; note whenever they mention Taylor&rsquo;s or another person&rsquo;s name. It&rsquo;s a blatant and rather clumsy way of guiding the reader away from the subject&rsquo;s views, like before every time they introduce another person into the article they&rsquo;re saying &#8220;now, this next guy is a racist so be prepared to NOT agree with him and AGREE with us! Racist racist racist, by the way, this guy is! BOOOOOO!&#8221;. And the crowd proceeds to throw rotten fruit at them.</p>

		<p>The only type of people who are allowed to reveal pro-white positions in the popular media are the idiots that appear on the &#8220;Jerry Springer&#8221; Show. In that way the multiculturalists can portray ALL white racialists as idiots. Of course they don&rsquo;t want a debate with someone like Jared Taylor, or any number of those from American Renaissance. That would show young people that the so-called &#8220;evil&#8221; white &#8220;racists&#8221; actually have a valid point of view, too. Well, thanks to the Internet, which is still free (So far!) these viewpoints are getting out to more people.</p>

<p>Well, what is untrue in that sample from Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s article Comrade Burghart?</p>
<p>The answer is nothing, and that is why you and people just like you can&rsquo;t stand Mr. Taylor or his positions. While he seeks to preserve and protect this country, your kind seek to destroy it for some fanciful fetish you call diversity. The fact that your precious diversity isn&rsquo;t working out and never will, only overtaxes your ant-like mental capacities and reduces you into hysterical accusations, using words that you either do not understand (such as fascism) or that are essentially meaningless (such as racism.)  </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, nonwhite immigration is destroying this country; these 100 million nonwhites contribute nothing but criminal misery and excessive resource consumption to the United States. The only thing that holds the country together is the 65% white majority, and when that drops to 55% or 45%, freakish fools like yourself will be walking about witlessly whining, &ldquo;what went wrong?&rdquo; </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I am convinced that in order to succeed, White Nationalist spokespeope are going to have to forsake the old school formulae of blanket racial hatred, especially when it is coupled to anti-Semitism.  What Amren and other publication and their editors ought to be doing is painting whites as a racial groups of many subcultures and even religions that have a right to exist, and ought to dominate in their ancestral lands or within nations created as they stand today by whites of European descent.</p>
<p>Portraying whites as a minority group with a right to survive and thrive cannot be reasonably argued off the table for long and if we focused on that, rather than fight rearguard actions whenever an issue arises that threatens a very damaged and difficult to defend Old School of referrences, we could be putting whites in a more positive light as in historical acheivements, the evolution of democracy, and the right of ALL races and cultures, including whites, to which the modern world owes its existence to have deserved pride in themselves and be appreciated.  </p>
<p>This daily denigration of whites in the media and on the street must cease or all causes will be lost.  But we ought to be intelligently fighting it, not insisting that everyone follow us back to &#8220;the good old days.&#8221;  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen - anyone of intelligence ought to be able to deduce that because it never happened in history, except when over-correction occurs, which is always a bloody mess worse than the previous problem.</p>
<p>The way forward for whites must be a new way.</p>

		<p>Definite cowards&hellip;  I&rsquo;m not sure whom they expected to participate in the debate.  Can anyone really have an anti-immigration stance and not be considered a racist by these standards?  What points would one make other than what Mr. Taylor would?  Also, consider hypothetically, would this same standard be applied to a debate about Australian aborigines and immigration of Europeans?  No.  The pro aborigine side would have no problems speaking ideas of preserving whatever culture they have.</p>
<p>I would like to compare the ideas of the unnamed immigration attorney and our Mr. Taylor.  Have the guts to post his name.</p>
<p>But whatever, I just wish the cultural decay of America would just get it over with and collapse so we can fight and rebuild.</p>

<p>Can you get any further from the truth?  It is liberal professors and administrators who have long used universities to promote themselves, censor opponents, and silence all debate.</p>
<p>Also how is it that Jared Taylor could legitimize himself in front of a university audience if what he says is so racist and patently false?  The university is afraid Taylor&rsquo;s realist views will resonate with students that still have an open mind.</p>

<p>You claim Mr. Taylor has a political agenda that would silence the voices of people of color on and off campus. As Mr. Taylor is an advocate for white people, you suggest it is wise the University NOT invite him? Can you not see the hypocrisy in this statement? You are doing the EXACT same thing you accuse Mr. Taylor of trying to do. Incredible!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that many left-wing, multi-cultural supporters or apologists of the black criminal underclass try to slip in some notion of anti-semitism when attacking any organization standing up for the rights of Whites or those of European heritage. This, in my eyes, is a cowardly tactic designed to limit the validation of any group with noble goals such as AmRen. It subtly injects a &#8220;hate everyone/Nazi murderer&#8221; label into the discussion and splits the focus off the main point. Most Jews I know are fed up with the same nonsense that AmRen readers understand all too well. I don&rsquo;t wish to turn this, or any story on this site, into a secondary debate on anti-semitism. Still, various false claims limit the participation and strength of white realists by preventing open-minded people from further investigation. With Jewish/Christian inter-marriage in the US now about 50% it also puts the brakes on non-Jewish partners and their families from playing a more active role in organizations like AmRen.    </p>

		<p>The Occidental Quarterly is not anti-Semitic. That&rsquo;s just another empty charge from the clowns at racist, anti-white hate organizations like the SPLC, ADL, ACLU and so on. The OQ is merely honest about racial differences, multiculturalism, immigration. In fact, it&rsquo;s like Amren in many ways. Which is why it attacked and the writers there called so many names, usually beginning and ending with &#8220;racist&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Notice, if you will, the neat ju-jitsu in the original article: someone who is described as being anti-immigration in the first paragraph has become anti-immigrant by the third. </p>
<p>See? I left out the quotation marks so so might not even have noriced the subtle switch.</p>
<p>A point to remember: always link the illegal immigration issue and the Third World immigration issue to the rape issue.<br>
 <br>
Wimmin&rsquo;s organizations in liberal colleges have strong views on rape and it&rsquo;s always useful to tell them loudly what everyone really already knows - that illegal immigrants and third World immigrants are dramatically overrepresented among rapists.</p>

		<p>Well, Ferris State shold get in touch with Lou Dobbs.  He is the one they should want now that he has made his peace with La Raza and MALDEF.  He suckered conservative whites for a long time on his CNN program.  He&rsquo;ll give the pro-immigration lobby just what they need, a polished white millionaire male who can speak out of both sides of his mouth.  </p>

		<p>Cultural liberals run from the racial disparity debate like a Victorian prude scurrying from a discusssion of sex!  They know it&rsquo;s a paltry argument to keep parroting the same reasons for black underachievement: African remoteness, slavery, colonialism, segregation, bad schools, bad jobs, covert white racism.  Now that it&rsquo;s becoming obvious that none of these affect pre-schoolers growing up in a society that lauds blackness above all else, they fear that intelligent young people are ripe for the facts that cannot be denied.  If someone finds out that there are scholarly racial realists quoting statistics about black IQ and crime, what might he do next?  Read one of these scholar&rsquo;s books?  Horrors!<br>
The same goes for reality in regard to Hispanics.  Obviously, the university wants a so-called debater to merely mouth vanilla platitudes against full amnesty and open borders.  God forbid that race actually be mentioned as an issue!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Taylor has enjoyed using university events like this to promote American Renaissance, legitimize himself, and bask in the attention created by the campus controversies that ensue when racists have a platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>This pitiful dork is unaware that the word &#8220;racist&#8221; is used nowadays mostly as a counter argument to someone&rsquo;s revelation of simple facts and/or educated opinions, just as he is doing right now, because he has no legitimate argument to offer.</p>
<p>I got half-way through the article, but I couldn&rsquo;t go any farther.  It amounts to no more than useless, hackneyed drivel by someone who is so full of hate himself he couldn&rsquo;t offer a legitimate argument if his life depended on it.</p>
<p>It would probably be a good idea if he got a hobby of some sort to keep him mentally occupied, something suitable for his personality that would make him smile a lot, like pulling the wings off flies.   </p>

		<p>This is why I have great disdain for most liberals. They paint all conservatives and pro-white people like us as being &#8220;stupid&#8221; and &#8220;uneducated&#8221; and &#8220;hateful.&#8221;  Mr. Taylor is NONE of those three attributes.  Liberals can&rsquo;t stand it when their opponents talk and look and act professional and civil.  It means they have to think of ways to discredit without their usual name calling.  Yeah, liberals.  The ones that say &#8220;how dare you judge me!&#8221; </p>

		<p>I can well imagine that Devin Burghart is one of the deceived whites.</p>
<p>He quotes an absolutely on-target passage from Jared Taylor, and ignores its clarity by presuming that Mr. Taylor is in need of &#8220;legitimizing&#8221; that viewpoint, which stands on its own merit.</p>
<p>The Mr. Burgharts of the world are the ones who threaten to bring us all to ruin.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am convinced that in order to succeed, White Nationalist spokespeope are going to have to forsake the old school formulae of blanket racial hatred, especially when it is coupled to anti-Semitism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agreed. Even for a non-Jew like me, who harbors very politically incorrect thoughts, anti-semitism is a red flag that I&rsquo;m dealing with a kook. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very interested to hear how you would justify that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m neither a Jew nor an anti-Semite, I feel a certain cultural kinship with Jews, and I think that they should have a place in the West.</p>
<p>But if I were debating an anti-Semite who says that Jews have no place in a White nation, I couldn&rsquo;t honestly call him a kook. To call him a kook would seem to undermine my own idea that Blacks have no place among Whites.</p>

<p>Seems like that&rsquo;s already been arranged. The USA is not as nice a place as it used to be, for all it&rsquo;s citizens, by any stretch of the imagination. One could take a Marxist type outlook and suggest that America still does somewhat (and purposefully) serve the interest of the wealthy like Mr Burkhart. The overall iron here&hellip; is that nowadays immigrants, until they&rsquo;ve been here awhile, are vastly superior to native Americans&hellip; not that I want any more of them to come. </p>

		<p><em>It claimed that &ldquo;White people&rdquo; had lost their voice&hellip;</em></p>
<p>According to this particular far left PC parrot, White people&rsquo;s very existence is questionable as displayed in his use of quotes around the term. I guess the same can be said when one describes Devin Burghart as a &#8220;journalist&#8221;.</p>
