			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Will Offensicht, Scragged, December 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The New York Times is wringing its hands about the disproportionate effect of the Obama Recession on blacks. Their teaser for &#8220;In Job Hunt, College Degree Can&rsquo;t Close Racial Gap&#8221; said:</p>
<p><em>There is ample evidence that race remains a significant obstacle for African-Americans in the job market, <strong>even those with degrees from respected colleges.</strong></em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p>How stupid does the Times think businesses are? Every private business wants to get the most possible work out of every employee and put the least amount of pay and benefits back in. Thus, when a manager interviews a candidate whom he thinks will either give less or cost more relative to other potential hires, he tends to move on to the next applicant. This is particularly true in times of economic distress when there are lots of candidates for every job.</p>
<p><b>Government Lies About Racial Group Skills</b></p>
<p>Why is the Times surprised that the recession would be harder on black people? Hasn&rsquo;t the Times heard of &#8220;race norming?&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in the 1980&rsquo;s, the US Department of Labor started promoting the use of its General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) to state employment services. When a state agency is trying to get unemployed people back to work, it&rsquo;s helpful to have a way to rate their skills and qualifications.</p>
<p>The GATB was developed in 1947 and was refined over the years to the point that it could usefully rate people for 12,000 different skill categories. Developing the test was a lot of work, but administering it doesn&rsquo;t cost very much. State agencies started administering the GATB and sending the results to interviews along with the candidates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was a fly in the ointment  &mdash;  blacks scored significantly below whites on the GATB and Hispanics scored someplace in between. Hiring based on raw test scores would have been inconsistent with the government&rsquo;s affirmative action goals. Accordingly, some bureaucrat conceived the idea of adjusting scores according to an applicant&rsquo;s race. If a black person took the test, his score would be compared <em>only with the scores of other blacks</em> who took the test. Thus, if a black person received a score of 90%, which was supposed to mean that he was in the top 10% of candidates who took the test, it really meant he was in the top 10% of <em>black</em> candidates, not that he was in the top 10% of the <em>overall</em> candidate pool. An employment web site puts it another way:<blockquote><i>As an example, three candidates take the test  &mdash;  one white, one black and one Hispanic. All three applicants achieve identical scores of 300 on the GATB. On the referral sent to prospective employers, however, the three candidates&rsquo; scores will appear quite different. The black test-taker will be listed as scoring 83, meaning he or she is in the 83rd percentile of all black applicants. The Hispanic will receive a score of 67 and the white a 45. Or, in other words, to be in the 50th percentile, the score for a black, Hispanic and white applicant, respectively, will be 276, 295 and 308.</i><br>
</blockquote>In other words, after spending large sums of taxpayer dollars developing a test that can accurately measure as many as 12,000 different job skills, the government fudges test scores reported to employers to make minority candidates seem better qualified than they actually are.</p>
<p>The web site quoted above says that methods of faking scores are &#8220;widely described in the literature on testing.&#8221; They have to be, of course. Computers weren&rsquo;t as available back when data faking was introduced so scores had to be tweaked manually. People who graded the tests had to be told how to &#8220;adjust&#8221; the scores.</p>
<p>How long did it take for businesses to find out what was going on? Even if the methods of lying systematically to employers weren&rsquo;t published, business folk talk to each other.</p>
<p><b>A Bum Hire Costs a Bunch</b></p>
<p>People in government generally have no clue how much it costs a business to make a bad hiring decision.</p>
<p>Employees cost money, time, benefits, and grief. The only reason ever to hire anyone at all is that the value of that person&rsquo;s work <em>to you</em> is more than what the person costs. Whenever a business hires anyone, they expect that person to add net value to the firm. In other words, every employee must be worth more than what he or she costs.</p>
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re looking for a delivery truck driver. You interview applicants, you look at their scores, you call former employers, and you hire someone. That person doesn&rsquo;t work out. You&rsquo;ve lost your earlier pool of applicants; the best of the ones you didn&rsquo;t hire will have found work so you start over. You&rsquo;ve lost whatever the bum cost you, and you lost the value he was supposed to add, not to mention irritating customers because of late deliveries. A bad hire is <em>very expensive</em> for any business.</p>
<p>Governments don&rsquo;t care because people have to deal with them and they can always raise taxes to pay for employees who don&rsquo;t do much work. That being the case, employment agencies don&rsquo;t appreciate how much businesses resent being lied to about the qualifications of the candidates the government sends them. Businesses have figured out how to un-fudge the data, however, so they contain their resentment. Over time, they figure out how much the government inflates the score of a black driver or a Hispanic roofer. They receive the fudged government scores, make the necessary mental adjustment <em>in the negative</em> to get a truthful picture of the candidate, hire accordingly and get on with life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more risk when you&rsquo;re hiring at the top of the food chain. Suppose you&rsquo;re filling a slot that needs someone from a &#8220;respected college&#8221; as the Times put it. That person&rsquo;s salary will be greater and training costs can be immense. One of our friends went to work for a bank just out of college. He spent the first <em>two years</em> in full-time training, on full salary, before he was able to do a lick of work for them. This is not unusual with high-end hiring.</p>
<p><b>Colleges Lie About Racial Group Degrees</b></p>
<p>The difficulty is that the &#8220;respected colleges&#8221; lie about the degrees they award. Every college that gets federal money in any form, including loans to their students, has to toe the government&rsquo;s line and admit minorities on an &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; basis. How long did it take for employers to realize that &#8220;respected colleges&#8221; offered two types of degrees, one for blacks and one for everyone else? Depending on the way they fudge applicant&rsquo;s scores during the admission process, some colleges award three or four kinds of degree depending on how finely they slice the applicant pool.</p>
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re hiring and your group is eligible for a major bonus if you make your numbers. If this new hire doesn&rsquo;t work out, <em>your</em> bonus will be reduced because your group won&rsquo;t perform as well, so you hire carefully.</p>
<p>The candidate&rsquo;s Yale or Princeton degree looks OK, all the profs give him rave reviews, but he&rsquo;s black. You know you&rsquo;re being lied to because Harvard and Princeton always lie about black graduates. It&rsquo;s your money on the line, if this guy blows it, you&rsquo;ll miss your bonus. What do you do?</p>
<p>You do exactly what the white students and professors did at Princeton while Michelle Obama was there. She described it eloquently:<blockquote><i>&#8220;My experiences at Princeton have made me far more aware of my &#8216;blackness&rsquo; than ever before,&#8221; the future Mrs. Obama wrote in her thesis introduction. &#8220;I have found that at Princeton, no matter how liberal and open-minded some of my white professors and classmates try to be toward me, I sometimes feel like a visitor on campus; as if I really don&rsquo;t belong. Regardless of the circumstances under which I interact with whites at Princeton, it often seems as if, to them, I will always be <em>black first and a student second.&#8221;</em></i> [emphasis added]<br>
</blockquote>White Princetonians knew that the Princeton administration systematically lies about black students&rsquo; qualifications. Michelle wasn&rsquo;t really a student, she was a &#8220;quota queen.&#8221; Her colleagues knew it and they let her know they knew it; those selfsame colleagues are now running major corporations and making high-level hiring decisions today, and what they learned in college hasn&rsquo;t been forgotten.</p>
<p>Remember the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz? His head was full of straw, he didn&rsquo;t have a brain. The Wizard took care of that  &mdash;  by awarding him a diploma! Unfortunately, a diploma does not a brain make, and all employers know it, even if the government hasn&rsquo;t yet caught on.</p>
<p>The Times said, &#8220;<em>even</em> those with degrees from respected colleges.&#8221; What they don&rsquo;t realize is that people who hire candidates from &#8220;respected colleges&#8221; are hiring at a higher level where they have a lot more to lose from an employee who isn&rsquo;t as qualified as he seems. By now, everybody at that level knows that &#8220;respected colleges&#8221; lie about minority graduates; a Yale minority degree is <em>actually</em> worth, well, about what a normal community college degree might be.</p>
<p>What the Times should have said was, &#8220;<em>especially</em> those with degrees from respected colleges.&#8221; Nowadays, an affirmative-action diploma is proof of nothing. Minorities who truly are the equal of anyone else and honestly did all the work to rightfully deserve a top-grade degree  &mdash;  and no one can deny the existence of black people like Thomas Sowell, Condoleeza Rice, and Colin Powell who fully deserve their membership in America&rsquo;s intellectual elite  &mdash;  are being cheated by the university&rsquo;s awarding that same degree to the less-qualified and diluting its value.</p>
<p>What are employers to do when they&rsquo;re lied to? Pass by on the other side. When in doubt, it&rsquo;s safest not to hire the minority person because you <em>know</em> you&rsquo;re being lied to. That&rsquo;s another way affirmative action holds blacks down.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent article.  I must take issue with that last statement about &#8220;holding blacks down&#8221;.  Insightful as the article is, it still misses the point: affirmative action hurts WHITE PEOPLE and holds WHITE PEOPLE down.  That should be the issue.</p>

To: Tell It Like It Is:</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t read the piece. Successful businesses don&rsquo;t operate on a hope and a dream. They succeed with competent people.</p>
<p>If it appears to you that more whites are employed in these successful businesses, it&rsquo;s because more whites are competent employees.  </p>
<p>Now a general comment:</p>
<p>If blacks want more blacks to be employed they have to focus their efforts like this:</p>
<p>Blacks need to understand that no one gives you a job. You go out and find one. Then you prove to your employer that you&rsquo;re a dependable and reliable worker who is an asset to the company.</p>
<p>Too many blacks don&rsquo;t seem to understand this common sense wisdom.<br>

		<p>Exactly. Everyone knows that &#8220;degrees from respected colleges&#8221; mean nothing if the graduate is a member of a protected victim group. <br>
Real businesses cannot afford to hire failures, but government agencies don&rsquo;t care - they don&rsquo;t have to make a profit - they just raise taxes if they don&rsquo;t have enough money.<br>
Take a look at the faces in government offices. Looks like government offices are the only ones hiring people with fake degrees.</p>

		<p>uniform standards means excluding all but a very few gifted blacks from most professions. </p>
<p>the alternative is the fairytale world of double standards we live in now.</p>
<p>but there are so many ways to acquire faked qualifications these days - for all races - that only one rule of thumb works:</p>
<p>assume everyone is an dumb as dirt (harvard degree notwithstanding) until PROVEN otherwise.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly call Sowell, Rice and Powell &#8220;high intellectuals,&#8221; especially Powell.  He&rsquo;s just as much a product of affirmative action fluff as the author of this article describes many black college grads.  Condi Rice is way smarter than the average black, but she isn&rsquo;t half as smart as she thinks she is.  And while Sowell has a profound point every once in awhile, he&rsquo;s no Sam Francis.</p>

		<p>If you look at the racial makeup of my company you&rsquo;ll notice that most of the blacks are disproportionately hidden in low-skilled clerical areas. They often slack and do a poor job, so there is usually a token white to pick up their slack. I suspect this is the usual way most corporations hit their minority quotas.</p>

		<p>See whites love to make affirmative action a black thing when, whites know, they strictly use affirmative action for every minority except black. Plus the white unemployment rate has NOT suffered one bit. This is a warning to black people. Start your own business and spend your money wisely. It makes absolutely no sense to give money away to those who would never give you a job or complain about they must. </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;due to family connections and the pigmentation of their skin&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve completely missed the point. The point is that a business owner should have the right to hire anyone he wants to hire for any reason he chooses. ANY reason. </p>
<p>If he wants to hire everyone in his family, that&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s HIS business. He&rsquo;s the owner.</p>
<p>If he wants to hire only Whites or only Blacks, that&rsquo;s HIS business. He&rsquo;s the owner. It should not be the place of the government to set quotas or force hiring practices on anyone.</p>
<p>Likewise, property owners should not be forced to rent to certain groups of people. The government should not be permitted to force a property owner to sell HIS property to buyer based on skin color. </p>
<p>These ideas are called FREEDOM. The government forcing you to do something against your will is NOT freedom. You should have the freedom to choose based upon your own standards and preferences.</p>
<p>The concept of freedom is not difficult. Do you understand now?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re only partially correct, Number 2. I&rsquo;ve seen the sham of family operated businesses for most of my life. Incompetence by close relatives is almost always ignored, while that of members outside the clan is almost always punished. It&rsquo;s quite maddening, indeed. But these companies suffer in the end because they can&rsquo;t provide good customer service on a level with public companies that draw employees from a larger pool, including qualified blacks. <br>
What upsets us whites is that the USA is supposed to be a meritocracy. At least that is what is drilled into our heads from an early age. And when all is said and done, success or failure in life is still the province of the individual, so we have every right to complain.<br>

<p>I am against unqualified whites being in positions of authority just as I am against blacks filling those positions.  </p>
<p>Tests are designed to weed out ALL unqualified applicants.  But extensive affirmative action programs have rendered so many of these test useless. </p>
<p>You argument is along the lines: whites commit crimes, too, so whites are in no position to complain about the high black crime rate.</p>

		<p>Re Anonymous #9.  I would LOVE for blacks to start their own businesses and spend their money wisely. There would be much less taxation on me for welfare and many less sets of chrome spinners on the road. I&rsquo;ve owned my own small business since 1978. It&rsquo;s not easy. It&rsquo;s hard work, long hours and requires self-motivation and self discipline. You betcha I would LOVE to see more blacks with those characteristics. And actually, yes, the white unemployment rate has risen dramatically also.</p>

		<p>The main problem is that supervisors are reluctant to discipline black employees for fear that they will pull the so called &#8220;race card&#8221; and file a grievance that the supervisor was racist even though the issue did not involve race at all. For example, my husband works in a hospital and there was a black woman who simply was not doing the job. He and several journeyman employees went to the supervisor and asked that she be terminated because she is not able to do the work. They were refused. This woman has gotten into a fight with a nurse on one ward, she had an eeoc complaint filed against her by a gay employee. None of the wards in the hospital want her to work with them. There is another black employee that is absent more than he is at work. He has been suspended several times but nothing more was ever done.</p>

		<p>Excellent article, and it reminds me of a book I read a few years ago.  In 2005 Steven Farron wrote an entire book on this subject entitled _The Affirmative Action Hoax: Diversity, the Importance of Character And Other Lies_.  When the book first came out I bought a copy for about $25.00.  A new copy on Amazon.com currently sells for $175.00.</p>

		<p>Well argued piece, though it didn&rsquo;t mention another huge factor mitigating against hiring blacks.  That is, once hired, firing them for non-performance can be so difficult that most companies just live with them and hope they eventually simply go away or get caught stealing, thus providing a unassailable case for letting them go, especially if law enforcement can be involved.</p>
<p>To be fair about it, blacks aren&rsquo;t the only ones to exploit privileged status.  Women, especially socially and economically lower class females, are ever-ready to make the claim of sexual harassment, file suit for being let go ostensibly because they were pregnant, or claiming unavoidable illness and uniquely feminine problems being responsible for chronic lateness or absenteeism.</p>

		<p>Having worked around blacks, I&rsquo;d say that most of them tend to be lazy.  One place I worked, I was training this black girl who was expecting me to do all the work (factory setting).  I just stood there and silently made it clear that she was going to have to pull her fair share of the load.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t last long, either.</p>
<p>I have seen blacks get one break after another when it comes to job performance.  Then when they finally get fired, another black screeches &#8220;racism.&#8221;  Can&rsquo;t win for losing!</p>

		<p>What passes for higher education today is a joke.  I went to grad school in the mid-1970&rsquo;s, where I had to be reading fluent in 4 languages to even be considered for my program.  I was one of 15 accepted that year.  The second year, we had to pass &#8220;writtens&#8221; - written exams on which they could ask you literally anything connected with your field.  All essay of course.  Many were eliminated from the school by that exam.  Today, degrees are bought and sold; anyone who has the money can take the courses, pass the Mickey Mouse exams, do the group projects - it&rsquo;s all a sham.  (I know because I did it.)  So today, graduates of ANY color are not very impressive.  I would happily compare a B.A. graduate from anywhere with a 12-year Catholic grade school-educated person of the 1960&rsquo;s.  The Catholic school grad from that era would win every time. Modern education is ridiculous.</p>

		<p>Blacks still believe in &#8220;cargo cult;&#8221; the belief by primative tribes that European manufactured products (cargo) were obtained by magic or some sort of unfair witchcraft or trickery.  They believe that they cannot get $100,000 jobs because of some ju-ju that the White man refuses to share.  </p>
<p>There is no magic, witchcraft, or trickery in obtaining a job.  You simply have to possess knowledge and skills that are useful to the employer.  What unique skills do you possess that would make someone give you $50,000 a year?  Also, are your skills and knowledge better than the other 10 candidates for the job?</p>
<p>Employers are not stupid.  They need to make a profit.  If a Black man is the best industrial chemist, or accountant, or welder, then they will hire the Black man.  A business that hires less-competant employees, will soon be out-of-business. </p>

Blacks think that it is unfair that they cannot obtain or hold jobs as easily as Whites or Asians.  However, what they don&rsquo;t realize is that you have to possess some marketable skill to get a job.  They think that they diserve a job, just because they are there   &mdash;   or because they are cool or dress sharp or are athletic or can talk loud, or because their ancesters suffered.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t realize that one actually must learn (and remember) stuff in order to get employed.  Whites know this.  That is why you can drive by any college in the USA, at any time of day, and see dozens of Blacks playing basketball on the courts outside the dorms.  Meanwhile, at any time of day or night, White and Asian kids fill the library.  I challenge you!  Next spring, when it is warm, drive by your local college and count the number of Blacks playing BB.  Then walk through the library and count the number of Blacks.  You will be astounded.  Could this, perhaps, contribute to lower graduation rates, GPAs, and subesquent employment among Blacks?</p>

		<p>All I know is I&rsquo;ve been working for 35 years and I would never, ever hire a black to work for me if I had my own business. I have spent a lifetime working with blacks, and every other race, culture and ethnicity and blacks are the worst by a huge margin. On the other hand I would have no inherent objection to hiring a person of say, a Japanese background.</p>

		<p>I had a discussion with a really liberal coworker about this article.  I brought up how the recession is hurting everybody&rsquo;s job prospects and businesses are not hiring across the board, but she wouldn&rsquo;t buy it and held to her guns that it was racism.  </p>
<p>Later on, after wrapping my brain around the problem, I hit upon another reason for the bleak job prospects for professional blacks, and I&rsquo;m just waiting for the topic to come up again to spring it on her.  I also wish someone would push this on the national scene as well.</p>
<p>I live in the largest urban area of the country.  There are almost no whites around except for scattered pockets.  Latinos and Asians dominate almost everywhere, outside the 3-4 black ghetto areas.  So here is the kicker:</p>
<p>Black job seekers are complaining that when they apply to white-owned firms that they are kept out, but in many parts of the country, especially where a lot of urban, college educated blacks are, a huge and growing percentage of the businesses from corner stores and restaurants to architectural firms or lawyers offices are owned by latinos, Asians, Arabs, Persians and a hundred other groups.</p>
<p>Those racial groups DO NOT HIRE BLACKS PERIOD.  When was the last time you went to an Asian owned establishment of any sort and saw ANY black workers anywhere?  Chances are nil.  How about LAtino owned business?  Arab?  Etc&hellip;  (By the way, these groups don&rsquo;t hire white people, either.)</p>
<p>Why are blacks not realizing that only whitey will give them a job, and with increasing immigration and &#8220;diversity&#8221; the chances for economic success diminish for them.  They cannot complain about racism in hiring, as this article is documenting, without also starting a campaign of &#8220;equal-opportunity&#8221; and Affirmative Action directed towards those racist Asians, Latinos, Arabs, etc. who do not hire blacks at all.</p>
<p>White liberals and social justice types give minorities a free pass to discriminate against each other, especially blacks, and they need to be called on it and challenged to 1) leave the shrinking white population alone and 2) redirect their energies to getting racial harmony across all races, not just every minority versus white.  </p>
<p>Look, since we are set to lose control of our country in a few decades and become a minority ourselves in the land of our fathers, shouldn&rsquo;t the liberal types start to indoctrinate the minorities in more than just hate whitey?  What good is social justice if a majority Latino and Asian America replaces whites as the chief obstacle to black success?  Social justice demands that the activists do # 1 and 2 above, because, as you know, Blacks and Latinos are not producing people with ideas about racial harmony.  Those two groups are producing race haters and chauvanists who are looking out for the interests of their race only as they pick the dying body of whitey clean.</p>

		<p>White people pool their money and open businesses, or invest with those who will do that.  The idea is to make more money than you put in.  There are enough black people out there who are rich enough to invest and spread the capital among their community, but you don&rsquo;t see much of it.  Some blacks open businesses, and there is a rising black middle class, but it still seems they are depending too much on whites to &#8220;help&#8221; them.  No one helped my family, or me.  My parents slaved in factories there whole lives.  I put myself through college with no scholarships or grants by working 2 sometimes 3 jobs and taking 1-2 classes a term.  Then with education under my belt, I went out to look for work.  I was hired by a black woman in the human resources dept of a major urban area, and when I attended the job fairs that they make teachers attend to match up with prospective schools, 90% of the crowd of 2,000 or so were - white!</p>
<p>Blacks need to understand that no one will help anyone in this world for free.  You have to toughen up and create your own economic destiny, and not by selling contraband.  Sometimes progress is slow and measured in generations, not months.</p>

		<p>Avoiding hiring of Blacks simply is good business sense. Because of the certainty that any Black hire &#8220;not working out&#8221; will simply result in screams of &#8216;discriminashun&rsquo; and litigation launched on behalf of the incompetent Black worker by a shyster attorney out for a fast buck.

		<p>This disgusting policy by the government and corrupt academics are responsible for the deaths of many whites; the beatings of many others; and the placing of this nation on the brink of racial war 24/7.</p>
<p>Why?  Because it instills and perpetuates within blacks, the lie of equality when equality doesn&rsquo;t exist.  Just like the radical leftists at the NYT who are so ignorant as to buy into the equality scam, blacks believe they ARE equal in every respect to whites and it enrages them when they can&rsquo;t compete, because their incompetence eventually becomes common knowledge, no matter how many underhanded tricks are put into place to try to support an Orwellian lie.</p>
<p>One would think that the fact blacks can&rsquo;t compete with the other races either would act as a neutralizing agent for their anti-white feelings, but, of course it does not.  They carefully avoid the subject at all times.  And, if pressed, they&rsquo;ll say the disparity is the result of slavery or white on black oppression and/or racism &#8220;for 400 years.&#8221; </p>
<p>The result of this big lie is a hostile population, each of whom walk around with a chip on his/her shoulder, feeling justifiably hostile  against employers, which, then, because of their limited intellect, is transferred to the entire white population.</p>
<p>Ugly black faces, set into perpetual looks of outrage and disgust, don&rsquo;t mind passing along the &#8220;injustices&#8221; they believe they have suffered until it is common knowledge within the entire black community nationwide.  Such attitudes give support to ignorant black paranoia wherein they collectively believe the white population (via the government) blew up the levees to destroy blacks in N.O.; introduuced aids and drugs in black communities; and are even responsible for all the black pathologies rampant throughout the country.</p>
<p>Armed with these erroneous fixations, young, even dumber blacks, willingly accept all these conspiracy stories and I&rsquo;m pretty sure it sets in the black mind a determination to not try in school, because they&rsquo;re convinced it doesn&rsquo;t do any good anyway because whites will always get preferential treatment, and blacks will be &#8220;discriminated&#8221; against.</p>
<p>So they go looking for whitey to even the score and get a little payback with a gun, or via the humiliation of rape, or just simple mob violence against lone, or few, unsuspecting whites.</p>
<p>This lie of equality and the failed efforts to try to flim flam the public into accepting it causes the emergence of many more problems than those listed here, but it would take a book to list them all.  Suffice it to say that the equality lie is responsible for a very large percentage of the racial problems we have, and it should be rectified by reporting the truth. </p>
<p>Many in government and academia are aware of the problems caused, but they have some distorted idea that, as in old communist regimes, intimidation techniques are sufficient to suppress the truth.  In Russian if a person didn&rsquo;t buy into the Big Lie he wouldn&rsquo;t be heard from anymore.  In the US he is roundly criticized as an abysmal &#8220;racist,&#8221; or a &#8220;hater,&#8221; who is stupid and wants to kill everybody.</p>
<p>Before this economic disaster hit, I was of the opinion that this concocted condition would eventually tip a large percentage of blacks into eventual civil war against whites.  I still believe that, but it&rsquo;s become apparent to me that the situation will accelerate, because the economic fiasco is causing the situation to &#8220;fast forward.&#8221;  Instead of having twenty years before critical mass, it will now be closer to five, maybe even less.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that whole heartedly.  As much anti-white hostility as there is in this country today, which is being fueled constantly by moronic, leftist whites, as well as the blacks leadership who are overjoyed to have someone to blame for black incompetence, it just isn&rsquo;t possible to keep a lid on it for much longer.  It&rsquo;s a situation that has gone on too long to be reversible, even by the threat of force.</p>

		<p>I was in Saudi during Desert Storm as a civilian adviser.  Talking with the Saudis reinforced all that has been said here.  The Saudis, since they are so oil rich, give each and every Saudi a stipend to live off of.  Therefore, they need to import workers to do all the normal menial and middle class jobs that need to be done.  That includes factory, shop keepers, lawn care, etc the whole range of jobs not involving supervisory (which the Saudis keep for themselves as appointments).  They repeatedly told me the reason you see NO blacks in Saudi Arabia is that they are the most worthless, most troublesome, and least intelligent group of employees they&rsquo;d ever imported, and would never import blacks again.  They were lazy, stupid, and criminal thinking nothing of stealing in a country that lops off hands for theft, nor raping in a country that beheads rapists.  Their words, not mine.  They won&rsquo;t even import Muslim blacks for any reason, but allow them to make the Haj, as long as they leave immediately when the Haj is over.  </p>

		<p>Dear Ranger, Post # 37,</p>
<p>Yes, basing our society on lies causes more problems than it solves.  I think that most Whites want to live peacefully with Blacks and desperately want Blacks to succeed.  Hence, they support the Big Lie. The problem is, one lie leads to another, to another, &amp; yet another, until the entire society is upside down and gridlocked. </p>
<p>It is time to admit the truth and then build the best society from those truths.  It won&rsquo;t be the end of the world.  We already admit that some races are better than others at athletics, lactose tolerance, disease resistance, cold or heat tolerances, Vitamin D production, etc., yet, our society survives.  Our society will likewise survive after we all admit the obvious about Black IQ.  In fact, our society may operate more efficiently. </p>
<p>All truths are connected, and you can&rsquo;t base our entire culture around a giant lie, without it corrupting our entire society.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Tell it Like it is&rsquo;, for every white alcoholic n&rsquo;eer-do-well who is &#8216;carried&rsquo; by his white relatives in a family business, there are two relatives, somewhere, who are worked like they are chattel slaves.</p>
<p>My Grandfathers worked their Sons nearly to death.  I&rsquo;m chummy with a (now-wealthy) Norwegian family out of Minnesota with similar stories, including tales of Child-Welfare coming after them because of how hard the father worked the under-age sons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the car with a near-billionaire Sicilian developer while he screamed on the carphone to his son (in another city) to go out, in a rainstorm, onto a sixth-floor ledge, and fix a leak that was threatening the electronics of a tenant.  According to friends, this happens in that family, every time there&rsquo;s a storm and a leak.  That&rsquo;s the norm, in my world.  The dysfunctional, substance-abusing relative who&rsquo;s propped-up in business by family connections&hellip;.well&hellip;.those people almost always precipitate the end of a family business.  Maybe what you describe is how it used to be, but not any more.</p>
<p>And the big, blond hottie who works for the big corporation and who seems to never do anything&hellip;.  Well, his ability to schmooze and con is probably formidable.  He may look like he does nothing: but in truth, he probably more than pays his way with his ability to sell/negotiate.  Men like that are crucial to their companies.  I&rsquo;ve seen them in action, and been astonished by what they were able to make happen.  What you don&rsquo;t see is the endless business refresher courses a guy like that takes, and the seven-days-a-week workout regimen he&rsquo;s on&hellip;because he knows that the minute he ceases to be seductive and effective, his golden parachute will lie in shreds.  </p>
<p>Free rides for white people in business disappeared with the advent of the Eighties.</p>

		<p>Businesses have long seen affirmative action as a kind of tax imposed by the government. If you have to hire large numbers of unskilled, unmotivated, uncooperative and unintelligent workers to satisfy a government quota, then you need to hire a White worker to pick up the slack. This increases your overhead. </p>
<p>While it is true that one strategy is to limit your losses by flooding back office operations with blacks, in practice mid-level management is also made to absorb affirmative action hires. The blacks in such positions are no more productive than Antwone is out on the loading dock.</p>

It has even helped me in the predominately female field of health care since I have to lift patients who usually outweigh me.  What strengths do your white co-workers have that you don&rsquo;t?  How can you match their strengths by compensating for the weakness that you cannot overcome?  Blaming imaginary racism will not do that for you.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, Mrs. Obama.  And you can thank the affirmative action quota system for that.  If there were no such programs at all, and you had to get into college based on REAL test scores, REAL results, and REAL value, then your fellow students would, in most cases, see you as being equal, and not an outsider.</p>
<p>I am reasonably racially aware.  But I also see value in anyone who can perform, or can do a job as well as or better than the norm, no matter the color of the heritage.  Prior to the invasion by illegals, there were plenty of businesses in Los Angeles, for example, that were founded and run successfully by folks of Mexican heritage.  Same with Asians.  No one handed them a thing.  Those with merit succeeded.  Maybe they were restricted from certain neighborhoods but they went on with their lives.</p>
<p>On the subject of making good hires: I work for a firm that operates worldwide.  In looking at the company roster, I see ONE black.  I also know this lady (and she is indeed a LADY) and she is more than competent and always goes the extra mile.  She is also pleasant, kind, always ready with a smile and a laugh.  Could all this be why none of us give her race or heritage a second thought?<br>

<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;ve completely missed the point. The point is that a business owner should have the right to hire anyone he wants to hire for any reason he chooses. ANY reason. </p>
<p>These ideas are called FREEDOM. The government forcing you to do something against your will is NOT freedom. You should have the freedom to choose based upon your own standards and preferences.</p>
<p>The concept of freedom is not difficult. Do you understand now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anonymous, I understand. The trick now, however, is to force our government to cease acting unconstitutionally by passing laws that take away a citizen&rsquo;s right of free association (or even obey the Constitution generally for that matter.) <br>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Those racial groups (Asians, hispanics, Armenians, Persians) DO NOT HIRE BLACKS PERIOD. When was the last time you went to an Asian owned establishment of any sort and saw ANY black workers anywhere?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only won&rsquo;t they hire them, they despise them and don&rsquo;t want them living in their neighborhoods or attending the same schools as their children.</p>
<p>The HUGE HUGE advantage the racial groups you mentioned have over Whites is their languages. Any business, large or small, run by Farsi or Mandarin-speakers is not going to hire blacks.  Non-English languages make it easy to circumvent AA rules that White businesses subjected to  &mdash;  that and the AA and EEOC kommissars are only interested in harassing Whites. </p>
<p> White propensity for individuality and individual vs. group rights is our Achilles Heel  &mdash;  this is what has been used against us by our enemies and the Fatal Flaw we need to overcome.  We must DEMAND that the feds allow us the absolute right to form White advocacy groups without being smeared as Klansmen or Nazis or White Supremacists or Hate Groups and speak out against injustice without fear of losing our careers, reputations and life savings.</p>
<p>Until we change this, we are vulnerable and open to destruction.</p>
