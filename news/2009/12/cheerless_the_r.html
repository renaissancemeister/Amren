<h1>Cheerless: The Real Reason Lincoln High No Longer Has Spirit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beth Slovic, Willamette Week (Portland, Oregon), December 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lincoln High&rsquo;s boys basketball season opened Nov. 30 with all the fanfare one would expect.</p>
<p>The bleachers were packed as the Lincoln Cardinals hosted Jefferson High. Students wore the school&rsquo;s red and white. The band played Gary Glitter&rsquo;s stadium anthem &#8220;Rock and Roll, Part 2.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only one thing was missing: Lincoln&rsquo;s cheerleaders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The reason for the cheerleading team&rsquo;s collapse is no secret in the Portland Public Schools system. Yet when people talk about it, it is in hushed conversations and carefully coded language.</p>
<p>The team dissolved because of one African-American student from the east side of the river  &mdash;  a cheerleader who used to be a boy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet none of these incidents has been as heartbreaking for students and as confusing for adults as the collapse of the cheerleading team. In the other three cases, the teams carried on. The basketball coach kept coaching. New coaches came forward to supervise baseball and football.</p>
<p>The cheerleading team is different. At the moment, there isn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>About 2,500 girls participate in cheerleading in Oregon high schools, making it the fifth-most popular sport for girls in the state, according to the Oregon School Activities Association.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, cheerleading is not for the weak-spirited; Lincoln&rsquo;s team subverts the typical pompom-waving stereotype with a fierce dedication to competition. The state&rsquo;s best teams face off at tournaments that require extensive training in tumbling, jumping and stunting  &mdash;  the gravity-defying moves that propel cheerleaders known as &#8220;flyers&#8221; into the air. Some girls take private lessons to perfect their back tucks and basket tosses. Injury is a regular occurrence. Black eyes are as routine as back handsprings. And appointments at the chiropractor are as commonplace as trips to Starbucks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Above prettiness and popularity, uniformity is a cheerleader&rsquo;s most cherished value. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how high a girl can jump or how effortlessly she can perform the splits in midair. If her movements don&rsquo;t match those of her teammates, the group&rsquo;s performance is incomplete. In cheerleading, probably more so than in most aspects of American girlhood, sameness is a plus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Into this tradition, a new cheerleader arrived at Lincoln&rsquo;s tryouts last spring. Even to the casual observer, there was something different about Alonza, a transfer student from North Portland whose oval glasses suggested a bookish personality and whose bright orange high heels revealed an edgier side. (WW has chosen not to publish Alonza&rsquo;s last name.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whether she was wild or just a typical teen testing boundaries, one thing was clear at tryouts in April: Alonza was strong, and her jumps were impressive. Before school ended in June, coaches granted Alonza a spot on the varsity squad.</p>
<p>They did so even though it was abundantly clear Alonza used to be a boy. At her prior high school, Alonza was known as Alonzo.</p>
<p>In Oregon, boys may be high-school cheerleaders; last year close to 400 were. Yet Alonza was not on Lincoln&rsquo;s team as a boy. Alonza identified as a girl and, as such, wanted to wear a girl&rsquo;s uniform, with the fitted top, the short skirt and the red Spanx underneath.</p>
<p>And that was fine, according to the team&rsquo;s coaches, Cher Fuller and Tori Cotton, who welcomed Alonza as Lincoln&rsquo;s  &mdash;  and most likely Oregon&rsquo;s  &mdash;  first transgender cheerleader.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Oregon School Activities Association, the sanctioning body for all high-school sports in the state, has never before considered what it would do if a transgender student wanted to cheer competitively.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;transgender&#8221; has broad meaning. It represents a spectrum of identities that aren&rsquo;t necessarily related to an individual&rsquo;s sexuality or anatomy. Children or adults who are transgender can be biological males who identify as females, or vice versa, regardless of whether they have undergone surgery or hormone therapy. They can be straight, gay or bisexual.</p>
<p>It is not at all clear where Alonza falls along this continuum. But it didn&rsquo;t much matter at Lincoln.</p>
<p>While the OSAA may have been unprepared to accommodate a transgender cheerleader, Lincoln embraced Alonza.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Favor Ellis, program director for Portland&rsquo;s Sexual and Minority Youth Resource Center, says Lincoln is a leader in adopting policies to protect students who don&rsquo;t fit the typical definition of boy or girl. In 2008, Lincoln created a &#8220;gender-neutral&#8221; restroom.</p>
<p>In keeping with that seemingly progressive attitude, Alonza was fitted in May for a girl&rsquo;s cheerleading uniform along with the rest of her team. And in July, all 28 members of Lincoln&rsquo;s cheerleading team traveled to the University of Oregon in Eugene for a weekend cheerleading camp. While the other girls shared rooms, Alonza was given a private one with her own bathroom.</p>
<p>When practice resumed in August, Lincoln&rsquo;s cheerleading coaches asked Lincoln administrators which restroom Alonza should use at home games when the girls changed clothes. Coaches and administrators seem to have agreed that Alonza would use the girls&rsquo; restroom or, if that became a problem, the school&rsquo;s &#8220;gender-neutral&#8221; restroom.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s athletic code of conduct has strict rules against the use of alcohol and drugs. Alonza signed that agreement, as well as a second one tailored specifically for cheerleading.</p>
<p>By the end of August, Alonza had been reprimanded for a variety of infractions, according to documents WW has obtained. She was late several times to practices. She didn&rsquo;t show up at a fundraiser and didn&rsquo;t call to say she wouldn&rsquo;t be there. She rolled her eyes at teammates and coaches when practicing stunts. She posted photos on her MySpace page that appeared to show her drinking. Allegedly, she once said she would drop a flyer. At camp in Eugene she received an all-star award, but when she accepted the award she said, &#8220;Man, all I get is this stupid paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team had a three-strikes policy, and on Aug. 26, when Alonza was an hour and 45 minutes late to practice at Lincoln, the coaches decided she had used all three; they asked her to leave the team.</p>
<p>The next day, Peyton Chapman, Lincoln&rsquo;s principal, asked the coaches to give Alonza another chance. They did. After drafting a new code of conduct agreement with Alonza, the coaches agreed to put her on the junior varsity team. &#8220;Eye-rolling or &#8216;diva behavior&rsquo; will not be tolerated,&#8221; the agreement read.</p>
<p>The problems didn&rsquo;t end. On Oct. 7, Lincoln&rsquo;s JV football team played Hillsboro High and Alonza used the women&rsquo;s restroom. According to an email Coach Cotton sent to Principal Chapman later that evening, &#8220;the other cheerleaders felt uncomfortable changing in there with her. Now I have parents calling and complaining about the situation and threatening to leave the program because of it&hellip;.PLEASE HELP my program is in jeopardy because of all of the back-and-forth concerning this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to spectators, the drama also spilled onto Lincoln&rsquo;s track during the game, when one of the Lincoln cheerleaders accidentally cheered at the wrong moment. A few girls (including Alonza) giggled, prompting the first girl to cry. Then another teammate criticized Alonza, who apparently broke formation, went into the stands and protested. An anonymous emailer complained to the school about Alonza&rsquo;s behavior, and the principal forwarded the email to the coaches.</p>
<p>That, apparently, was the breaking point. Coach Cotton wrote to Alonza&rsquo;s mother the following week via email: &#8220;Alonza is no longer able to cheer with our program due to her violation of the contract where it states that &#8216;representation of Lincoln High School will be made in a positive manner.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The response from Alonza&rsquo;s mother came the next morning. &#8220;[Y]ou guys are going to do what you want which is fine,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;but you also should know i think you and the coaches are RACISTS and some of the cheerleaders also.&#8221;</p>
<p>That might have been the end of the story, were it not for Principal Chapman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking about Alonza, Chapman chooses her words carefully, befitting her background in law. But it&rsquo;s apparent Chapman believes Alonza was unfairly targeted. &#8220;This was a kid who worked well with staff and administrators,&#8221; Chapman says. &#8220;To my knowledge, this student was not a discipline problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Oct. 23, Chapman emailed the cheerleading coaches and ordered them to reinstate Alonza to the varsity cheerleading team. &#8220;I wish this were a mutual decision but at this point it is not your decision to make,&#8221; Chapman wrote. &#8220;I have made a decision and I feel comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Alonza&rsquo;s mother called the dispute a matter of racial discrimination, Chapman has said publicly she didn&rsquo;t consider race when making her decision. It&rsquo;s probably not a coincidence that Lincoln next month is hosting a &#8220;courageous conversation&#8221; about &#8220;support for students and parents of sexual minorities in our learning environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Four days after Chapman made her decision, the two coaches resigned, later writing in a joint statement, &#8220;The interferences in implementing disciplinary actions have taken away our authority as coaches and thus created an uncontrolled and unsafe environment for our athletes.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Chapman says she wants them to cheer. Within days of the coaches&rsquo; resignation, Chapman had identified new coaches to lead the team.</p>
<p>Most of the cheerleaders, however, have rejected the new coaches, who have more extensive backgrounds in dance than cheerleading. None of them was certified to supervise stunts.</p>
<p>Portland news media treated the matter in a somewhat bizarre fashion.</p>
<p>KGW TV aired a story Oct. 29 reporting that the team had dissolved because of the reinstatement of one cheerleader. It broadcast an interview with Alonza, who said the coaches&rsquo; decision to remove her from the team was &#8220;racially motivated.&#8221; (Three other members of Lincoln&rsquo;s cheerleading squad were, like Alonza, African-American. Seven of the 28 cheerleaders were nonwhite, making the squad as diverse as Lincoln as a whole.)</p>
<p>KGW made no mention of Alonza&rsquo;s gender identity, but it did say Alonza&rsquo;s mother worked at KGW.</p>
<p>Three days later, Oregonian columnist Steve Duin weighed in with a column that raised far more questions than it answered. He also declined to identify a central element of the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the recent headlines at the high school  &mdash;  the football coach fired after a beer-fueled encounter with police on a MAX platform, a second DUII by the boys basketball coach, the baseball coach resigning amid allegations he took players to a strip club  &mdash;  this adds to the impression that Lincoln is a grease fire,&#8221; Duin wrote in the column that ran Nov. 1.&#8221;But we might reserve judgment. This is a case where I can&rsquo;t tell you everything I know, because your right to know is superseded by the student&rsquo;s right to privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nine days later, Duin posted a link on his Oregonian blog to a New York Times story about transgender teenagers, with little explanation. &#8220;I&rsquo;ll let you connect the dots,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cher Fuller and Tori Cotton, the coaches who resigned, both say that [Alonza&rsquo;s being transgender] never mattered. They tried to enforce the rules consistently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could have had a girl with three arms and purple skin, and if she followed the rules I would have coached her just the same as anyone else,&#8221; Fuller says. &#8220;No decision that we ever made had anything to do with race or gender identity. We fought so hard for her. We stuck our necks out for her to treat her like all of the girls. The truth is, we asked someone to follow the rules, and the school asked us to give one person an exception.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If I did not know any better I would have thought that this piece was some sort of cosmic joke, a bit of light hearted humor before Christmas. I guess that it is &#8220;racist&#8221; to remove someone from a team due to misbehavior. I would certainly remove my daughter from a cheerleading squad if I knew there was a &#8220;transsexual&#8221; on the team, BTW this boy looks nothing like the girl he proports that he wants to be. I personally think that this was some sort of stunt that backfired and now it is ruined for everyone else on the squad. The &#8220;girl&#8221; obviously flaunted all of the rules so &#8220;she&#8221; definately should have been cut from the squad. A genetically female White girl would have been gone long since. </p>

		<p>Geez, Alonza&rsquo;s less feminine than that &#8220;woman&#8221; who won the sprint championships.</p>
<p>Oregon is one of the whitest states in the country, so they can generally indulge their limousine liberal fantasies like &#8220;gender is a societal construct.&#8221;  But while it&rsquo;s one thing to expect adults to accept transgendered persons, girls in school shouldn&rsquo;t have to accept it as another form of femininity.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the central question in my mind:  Did Alonzo/a really change genders?  If s/he did, why did s/he have to use a separate locker room?  I get the feeling that she was a he all along, and pretended that he became she, just to get close to white girls.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The term &lsquo;transgender&rsquo; has broad meaning. It represents a spectrum of identities that aren&rsquo;t necessarily related to an individual&rsquo;s sexuality or anatomy. Children or adults who are transgender can be biological males who identify as females, or vice versa, regardless of whether they have undergone surgery or hormone therapy. They can be straight, gay or bisexual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How about redefining sentences number one and two from the above, as follows: &lsquo;The term &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; is almost meaningless today. It represents a spectrum of identities that aren&rsquo;t necessarily related to an individual&rsquo;s sexuality or anatomy, or anything else; that is,  besides a specific personality disorder.&rsquo; </p>
<p>In my line of work, I have come into contact with a wide variety of &ldquo;sexual minorities;&rdquo; most that are not homosexuals outright, are struggling with that issue or asexuality. It is very rare to meet someone that has gone under the knife to have their gender &ldquo;reassigned,&rdquo; that is particularly happy with the results. Of course there have been exceptions, but in general, most remain indicative of surgically/sexually mutilated borderline personality disordered individuals and little else. Certainly there are a whole new set of problems to ruminate over and become hysterical about, but little psychological &ldquo;healing&rdquo; or sating is normally observed or reported.</p>
<p>Face it, surgery can only alter a person so much; after that, if you remain unhappy or unbalanced as an individual, you remain stuck with the sausage that you were and are, only now with a reconfigured casing. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>To summarize: because of the aberrant antics of one &#8220;special&#8221; freak, and the incompetent handling of the situation by the liberal activist Principal, all the kids lose their team. </p>
<p>And yet somehow the kids, their parents and their coaches are branded as &#8220;racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>This story is a strange, yet sadly typical example of the absurdities decent white families face in this country.</p>

		<p>Why am I not surprised?  A little diversity goes a long ways.  It takes out culture and tradition.  If little Alonzo can&rsquo;t cheer, no one will be allowed to do so either.  Its more Obama bringing us &#8216;together&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The school has at least one &#8220;gender-neutral restroom&#8221; for the transsexuals, transvestites and hermophrodites of the staff, student body and janitors.</p>

		<p>I caught the original interview if &#8220;it&#8221; on the local news station, this was before I had heard anything about the &#8220;trans&#8221; thing. The minute I got a load of &#8220;it&#8221; and heard &#8220;its&#8221; voice I thought, &#8220;damn that&rsquo;s one masculine looking/sounding female&#8221;. LOL </p>
<p>Funny thing is a another local story has &#8220;it&#8221; stating thats &#8220;its&#8221; actually a hermaphrodite and not a full male to female change. And that &#8220;its&#8221; just getting rid of the excess baggage soon so &#8220;its&#8221; not equipped with both. So some things arn&rsquo;t making sense to this story IMHO.</p>
<p>But really this goes to a famous black guys speech about &#8220;being judged by the content of your character and not the skin color.&#8221; Its seems the PC crowd has gotten everything to the point that you can be arrogant, inconsiderate, insubordinate,  etc, and when people get fed up with your behavior and refuse to tolerate it anymore, you can scream racism.</p>

		<p>&#8220;administrators seem to have agreed that Alonza would use the girls&rsquo; restroom or, if that became a problem, the school&rsquo;s &ldquo;gender-neutral&rdquo; restroom&#8221;.</p>
<p>If that became a problem!!? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all one big happy family, unless you are a white heterosexual male, in which case you better not even look at a female, unless you are exactly the same age as her, have exactly the same income, and are assigned to the same classroom, and if you do look it better not be a leer and you better make sure she looked at you first. </p>
<p>&#8220;you and the coaches are RACISTS and some of the cheerleaders also&#8221;</p>
<p>You know, is it just me or may there be a more important problem here than &#8216;racism&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>I have sympathy for &#8220;transgender&#8221; people.  I can not fathom how someone can look in the mirror, see a male and think they are female, or should be a female.  It is sort of like an anorexic looking in the mirror, and instead of seeing a bag of bones sees a fat woman.  You are what you are from my point of view.  That being said I do not think that children should have to deal with some other kid&rsquo;s emotional problem.  He is a BOY, regardless of what he thinks, and we shouldn&rsquo;t pretend otherwise.  The  girl cheerleaders should not be exposed to such freakishness.  And on top of it all he was a typical snot-nosed black punk who couldn&rsquo;t follow rules and was disrespectful.  This society that thinks everybody should be allowed to be whatever they want, at any time they want and act however they want has got to come to an end.  We are demented.</p>

<p>A surgery was performed when A was still in high school? That seems weird. A doc would do such a thing while a young person is at an age when they are undecided or was A decided at such a young age? Normally these surgeries are done only to older persons?</p>

<p>There is also the idea that the girls on the team are being hurt, but that&rsquo;s a small price to pay for the experience gained by seeing this circus. In the end, this might even help save the White girls lives sometime down the road.</p>

		<p>Big deal. So the school doesn&rsquo;t have a cheerleading team. In MHO, cheerleading is nothing more than burlesque, even though some people actually consider it a sport. Just because cheerleading takes place at sporting events, doesn&rsquo;t make it one.</p>
<p>Cheerleading is like exotic dancing - the primary purpose is for arousal, served up by the eye candy. The only difference between exotic dancing and cheerleading is the cheerleaders keep their clothes on after their dance routines are done.</p>
<p>Having said all that, this Alonza character is most certainly NOT a female. I don&rsquo;t blame the other cheerleaders for being wary of him. They shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay because he had a sexual identity conflict. His XY chromosome makeup makes him a male, regardless of what his outward appearance is.</p>

		<p>There is Sport that is not Athletic and Athletics that are not Sport. Non subjective, points win or first across the finish line competition is sport.<br>
For example, The 100 yard dash is both athletic and a sport. NASCAR and bowling is Sport but not Athletic as there is a clear winner and looser. Figure Skating is Athletic but not a Sport as winners are chosen on a far too subjective basis. (&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t paid her dues, so most likely that&rsquo;s why the French judge gave her a 4.&rdquo;)<br>

		<p>&#8221; It is very rare to meet someone that has gone under the knife to have their gender &ldquo;reassigned,&rdquo; that is particularly happy with the results. Of course there have been exceptions, but in general, most remain indicative of surgically/sexually mutilated borderline personality disordered individuals and little else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thats about the nuttiest most hateful thing I&rsquo;ve ever read. First off its not true I&rsquo;ve read the studies and survey results. Second it is far from a &#8220;mutilation&#8221; it is a ordered complex surgery where parts are repositioned not mutilated. </p>
<p>Second point. its not about personality disorder or anorexia or any other psychological syndrome. Gender if fixed at birth and because of the nature of how boys form 2 waves of in utero testosterone must occur to fully gender a infant male. If only the first occurs and not the second you get a brain gender of female and a physical gender of intersexed or male. Unlike a anorexic who can get psychological treatment, this is a biological issue. There is no psychological &#8220;cure&#8221;. </p>
<p>Finally, do I think some scary black dude looking sounding jerk should be allowed on the cheerleading team. Heck no. and no self respecting trans woman would either. After they finish their gender reassignment (if they really ARE trans and not just some NUT) then yes by all means. But they aren&rsquo;t welcome in women spaces until then, the last thing we need is our female teens to shower up against a big black guy and his male privates</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>As a parent of one of the varsity cheerleaders that resigned the team to support her coaches I have a couple of clarifications from first hand experience. I apologize since this will be lengthy.</p>
<p>@cybor the bathrooms do have stalls, but due to Cheerleading not having a locker room available for their use the bathroom facilities are where the team changes for games and events. This was done in the open area of the bathroom since changing into their uniforms in a tiny stall was not always feasible. The student in questions is a boy, that identifies as a girl, and as such made some of the players uncomfortable. The school provided a gender neutral bathroom for this students use at the beginning of the school year, but as late as Octboer 30 the student continued to join the team in the girls bathroom, against the wishes of some of the team and their parents. It was nothing against this student personally, it was that the parents of some girls (aged 13-17) were not comfortable with a anatomical male changing with their daughters. Despite being told by the coaches and administration to use the facilities provided, this person continued to show up in the female facilities. There were legal issues involved that the team needed to protect themselves and the student in question on.</p>

<p>Of course a woman principal is going to be giving orders to a man, nothing wrong with that, just doing a job. This is the 21st century not the 18th. Anyways, if this guy/gal whatever is anatomically male, which I strongly suspect, then he needs to be forced to use the men&rsquo;s bathroom etc. They shouldn&rsquo;t have shut down the cheerleading team but let this troublemaker go without apology and they shouldn&rsquo;t have catered to him.

<p>Interesting stuff there Comrade Foo. Just wondering, besides reading &ldquo;studies and survey results,&rdquo; have you ever actually met an individual that has undergone this procedure &ldquo;where parts are repositioned?&rdquo; Have you ever asked them what type of counseling and screening they went through, prior to this &ldquo;ordered complex surgery?&rdquo; For that matter, do you even know what the difference is between a personality disorder and an eating disorder?</p>
<p>Well, I have and do. I have worked in a variety of clinical settings (from hospitals to prisons, to be exact) and I will tell you from over 12 years of experience, that it is rather rare to meet an individual that has undergone the full surgery/gender &ldquo;reassignment&rdquo; and is satisfied with the outcome. It does happen, but less frequently then you might think; &ldquo;sexual minorities&rdquo; of questionably stability are often allowed this &ldquo;ordered complex surgery,&rdquo; without the proper controls and screenings of the past. Thus, a disordered personality with sexual confusion that has been mutilated, is the result about 90% of the time. </p>

		<p>&#8220;However, cheerleading is not for the weak-spirited; Lincoln&rsquo;s team subverts the typical pompom-waving stereotype with a fierce dedication to competition. The state&rsquo;s best teams face off at tournaments that require extensive training in tumbling, jumping and stunting &mdash; the gravity-defying moves that propel cheerleaders known as &ldquo;flyers&rdquo; into the air. Some girls take private lessons to perfect their back tucks and basket tosses. Injury is a regular occurrence. Black eyes are as routine as back handsprings. And appointments at the chiropractor are as commonplace as trips to Starbucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>THIS is the disgusting part.</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s no cheerleading team?</p>
<p>Good, let them go back to studying about the culture they stabbed in the back by supporting a fee-good theology that is preparing to burn them at the stake!</p>
