<h1><a href="https://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/dec/16/justice-restrains-lawyers-in-panther-inquiry/">Justice Department Restrains Lawyers in Panther Probe</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, December 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department has told the federal attorneys who filed a civil complaint against the New Black Panther Party for disrupting a Philadelphia polling place last year not to cooperate with an investigation of the incident by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.</p>
<p>The commission last week subpoenaed at least two Justice Department lawyers and sought documents from the department to explain why the complaint was dismissed just as a federal judge was about to punish the New Black Panther Party and three of its members for intimidating voters.</p>
<p>Joseph H. Hunt, director of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Federal Programs Branch, ordered the lawyers&rsquo; silence in a letter to the attorney for J. Christian Adams, the lead attorney for the department in the New Black Panther case. The letter said &#8220;well-established&#8221; and &#8220;lawful&#8221; Justice Department guidelines prohibited Mr. Adams&rsquo; cooperation in the commission probe.</p>
<p>In the letter, Mr. Hunt said the Civil Rights Commission &#8220;possesses no authority to initiate criminal prosecution of anyone&#8221; and has the ability only to make referrals to the Justice Department recommending that a criminal case be opened. The commission does not have the authority to enforce subpoenas, he added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Todd Gaziano, a nonpartisan member of the Civil Rights Commission, challenged the Justice Department&rsquo;s ruling, saying that the regulations cited do not apply and that the commission is &#8220;duly authorized by statute to review and report on enforcement activities of the Justice Department and other similar agencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Gaziano, a former Justice Department lawyer who served in the Office of Legal Counsel during the Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations, said the Justice Department &#8220;had it exactly backwards&#8221; when it suggested that there could be negative consequences for those who comply with the commission&rsquo;s subpoenas. He said a lawyer cannot refuse to comply with a subpoena he knows to be lawful.</p>
<p>He also said the commission&rsquo;s investigation could include public hearings in Washington and Philadelphia. The commission wants to know whether the decision to drop the charges constituted a departure from prior enforcement policy and whether its actions might lead to more voter intimidation, he added.</p>

		<p>So you&rsquo;re telling me the Justice Department is obstructing justice?  Who knew?</p>
<p>The US Commission on Civil Rights has eight directors, four appointed by the President, two by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and two by the Speaker of the House.  That would be Obama, Byrd and Pelosi, so I&rsquo;m really surprised they&rsquo;re acting here.  Most of them might be leftover Republicans, though.</p>

<p>I can answer this one.</p>
<p>The Panthers will be excused and forgiven for their error is judgment. Everyone else, from now on, especially whites who try to emulate what the Panthers did, will be prosecuted fully and without mercy.</p>
<p>In other words, the Panthers get a pass. Whites won&rsquo;t.<br>

		<p> The commission, by law, has explicit power to issue subpoenas, and the law mandates that &#8220;all federal agencies shall cooperate fully with the commission.&#8221;   Is it me or is Eric Holder out of control?   Bringing the terrorists to NYC for trial cannot be justified under any circumstances and now this.  The Panther case was won by default and then Justice went in and dismissed the case????   The Justice Department was in the final stages of seeking sanctions when a delay in the proceedings was ordered by Lorretta King, the prime mover, who was serving as a political appointee as the acting assistant attorney general. Ms King, a woman of color, ordered the case dropped with the approval of her superior.  This was a very serious case of voter intimidation by use of language and the banishing of a billy club.  This, along  with almost all of Obama&rsquo;s outrageous activities spell BIG trouble for America and its citizens.<br>
Just like Holder&rsquo;s decision to bring terrorists to NYC, the dismissal of this case cannot be justified and Holder apparently knows it.<br>

		<p>I guess the Civil Rights industry seems once again only interested when it&rsquo;s non-whites or homosexuals or non-Christians whose rights are being violated.</p>

		<p>I said it before and I will say it again, Holder sympathizes with Black supremacists because, deep down, he&rsquo;s one. He has just been able to fly under the radar, whereas loud mouth black supremacists like Jeremiah White ran interference and took the heat while Holder came in through the &#8220;back door&#8221;, ironic.</p>

		<p>This incident, in and of itself, should leave no doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind that the Feds have an anti-white agenda. White people who can&rsquo;t see it simply refuse to see it. Do these traitors actually believe that minorities in power will spare them because they are complicit? Do these people have children?<br>
   Those who do will leave a bitter harvest for their offspring. I can&rsquo;t figure out their motivation. Is it some perversely twisted sense of altruism or a sick self-hatred that is extended to all white people? No matter, they should all be hauled up on street corner lamp posts.</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t insert alot of neocon psuedo-conservative viewpoints into this black panther case.  I for one am happy these terrorists are being put on trial in a civilian court.  Alot of things can come out that wouldn&rsquo;t in a military tribunal.  George Bush can be subpoenaed along with alot of other people who started this decade long chain of events that led to the loss of our freedoms.  Perhaps we can finally put those widely believed conspiracy theories that are floating around out there to rest&hellip;..or maybe not.</p>

		<p>I heard that Fox News covered this, so hopefully it will keep on with the story.  Obama must be completely out of the loop if he&rsquo;s letting Holder and his minions alienate white people to the extent this has and will further.  It&rsquo;s one more wrist slash in the accomplishment of political suicide, so be it.<br>

		<p>So what good is having blacks in power and in control of a historically white country again?  How was this supposed to be our strength and good for whites?  I must have slept through that lesson in the course Brainwashing 101 I took in college.</p>

		<p>You can imagine what would happen if you pamphletted White voters outside the polling station to let them know which candidate is working hardest to affirmative action them out of a job. Even if you simply handed out lollipops saying &#8220;White Pride&#8221; you would be seen as intimidating minorities. </p>

		<p>The case shifted from adult to juvenile court, and Séamus T learned in September that two of the three rapists were back at Magruder High School. He filed a complaint with the board of education, and succeeded in having them transferred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter was the only white kid at the party,&rdquo; Séamus T says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the attack was racially motivated, but there were racial and class undertones in the courtroom. On one side you had the three rapists, an aunt and two single mothers, all African-Americans. On the other side, everyone was white and middle class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Montgomery county circuit court judge Steven Salant so enraged Séamus T that he filed a complaint with the Maryland Commission on Judicial Disabilities, the body that disciplines judges, on the grounds his daughter &ldquo;was not treated with dignity and respect&rdquo; as required by the state constitution.</p>
<p>Salant did not respond to The Irish Times&rsquo;s request for comment, which was made through the court&rsquo;s spokesman.</p>
<p>Séamus T says Salant blamed the victim and made excuses for the rapists, who he sentenced to probation only. As recounted by the Gaithersburg Gazette newspaper, the judge described the gang-rape as &ldquo;horrific&rdquo;, but focused on Erin&rsquo;s behaviour on the night of the party.</p>
<p>The victim was drunk and &ldquo;engaged in risky and provocative behaviour&rdquo; such as sitting on people&rsquo;s laps and talking about &ldquo;hooking up&rdquo;, Salant said in court. &ldquo;This was a disaster waiting to happen &hellip; There was a dynamic at work here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were things going on here. It doesn&rsquo;t make the respondents any less worthy of blame, but what it does mean is I have to determine whether what we have here is sexual predators or respondents who &hellip; did not get that when a girl is intoxicated and presents herself in that manner you do not take advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were devastated as a family. We were destroyed,&rdquo; says Séamus T.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went to court expecting some compassion. The system is upside down and backwards. The judge was worried about the rapists staying in school, getting evaluated, getting counselling and transportation. Everything is lavished on them. Nobody knocked on my door and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you through the system&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Séamus T&rsquo;s appeals to first lady Michelle Obama, Maryland governor Martin O&rsquo;Malley and state attorney John McCarthy have gone unanswered. He was treated with kindness by the Irish Embassy, which promised to intervene if he felt he was not being treated as a US citizen would be.</p>
<p>The state legislature has provided the most hope of redress.</p>

		<p>A seasoned electoral observer posted outside this particular polling place commentated that it was the very worst and most explicit case of political intimidation he ever witnessed in his life - and he had been an impartial observer of elections in many a so-called 3rd world country.<br>
 Apparently outright verbal threats and brandishing of billy-clubs in order to frighten off voters openly occurred - in America of 2008 - the country of Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Patrick Henry etc, a state based on the highest ideals of democracy as its moral touchstone.<br>
 How the mighty have fallen!!!<br>
For years TV viewers have had imposed on them endless film loops of supposed &#8216;intimidation&rsquo; in the old soth and words like &#8216;Bull Connor&rsquo; thrown about, shots of barking dogs and water-cannon etc etc, but NOTHING, NOTHING the old southerners ever did matches the brazen, stinking shamelessness of this incident.<br>
 To make things worse the race hustlers who have taken control of Obama&rsquo;s legal machine are prostituting the hallowed uS judiciary by fighting a corrupt partisan battle to protect their own. - If this is asign of things to come it bodes very, very ill for the USA.Latin American states would be ashamed if this foul corruption.</p>
