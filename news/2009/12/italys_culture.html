<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/13/italy-racism-football-mario-balotelli">Italy&rsquo;s Culture of Racism Exposed by Fans&rsquo; Abuse of Black Football Star</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Kington, Guardian (London), December 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The songs are varied, offensive and, in at least one case, openly racist. &#8220;If you jump up and down, Balotelli dies&#8221; is a favourite with supporters of arguably the most famous Italian football club, Juventus.</p>
<p>&#8220;A negro cannot be Italian&#8221; is the chant that explains the vitriol. The target of the abuse is 19-year-old Mario Balotelli, a footballer with Italian champions Inter Milan and a rising star of Italy&rsquo;s Under-21 national team.</p>
<p>In England, Germany or France, Balotelli would be making headlines in the sports pages as one of the most exciting young prospects in the national sport. In Italy, his treatment at the hands of a minority of hostile football fans is turning him into a symbol of the country&rsquo;s seeming inability to embrace a multi-ethnic identity. Last Monday, Juventus were fined for anti-Balotelli chanting at a match for the second time this season.</p>
<p>Balotelli was born  &mdash;  and immediately abandoned by his Ghanaian parents  &mdash;  in the Sicilian capital, Palermo. He is an Italian passport holder and was brought up by adopted parents in Brescia from the age of two. He speaks with the accent of his region, but has received far more racist abuse than other black stars in Italian football because his Italian identity is seen by some as a provocation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difference [from other black players] is Balotelli is totally black and totally Italian, and that has provoked a short circuit among fans,&#8221; said Sandro Modeo, a correspondent for Corriere della Sera.</p>
<p>As Italy&rsquo;s immigrant total reaches 7%, the treatment of many of the &#8220;Balotelli generation&#8221;  &mdash;  the half-million children of immigrants born in Italy who qualify by law for Italian citizenship on their 18th birthday  &mdash;  is becoming an increasingly controversial issue in a country which still, overwhelmingly, considers itself white.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a black Italian writer, Pap Khouma, wrote an open letter to La Repubblica, headlined &#8220;Being a black Italian: my life as an obstacle course&#8221;. In it, he described incidents of routine discrimination: regular requests to provide his permit to stay in Italy; being mistaken for a street-seller by his Milanese neighbours. On one occasion, running through Milan&rsquo;s streets late for work, Khouma was stopped by a policeman, asked for his papers and escorted to the local station as a non-EU &#8220;foreigner&#8221;. &#8220;Have you any idea,&#8221; Khouma asked the paper&rsquo;s readers, &#8220;what it means to be Italian and black in Italy in 2009?&#8221;</p>
<p>For Gian Antonio Stella, a columnist for Corriere della Sera, the racism is evident and ignoring it a national pastime. &#8220;Britain has reflected on its colonial past, Germany has done the same with Nazism, but Italians still believe the myth of the Good Italian, soft colonialism and insist the racial laws of the 1930s were passed by fascists, not Italians,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties, the Balotelli generation is beginning to make its presence felt. The Italian under-14 cricket team is largely made up of Asian-Italians and won a European tournament this summer. Lihao Zhang, an 11-year-old girl of Chinese extraction, living in Voghera, the Lombardy heartland of the xenophobic Northern League party, received glowing press reviews after winning a school competition this year for poetry written in local dialect.</p>
<p>&#8220;The offspring of immigrants are easing into Italian culture, meaning Italian traditions are not going to be lost,&#8221; said Alessandro Campi, a professor of political science at the University of Perugia. &#8220;If anything, these children will have more problems with their own families&rsquo; cultures than with their friends&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Balotelli, a one-match ban for Juventus fans from their home stadium, follow-up fines of over €20,000 (£18,000) for the club and questions in parliament have failed to stop the chants, which are not limited to Turin, where the club is based. The coach of Ghana&rsquo;s national team, Milovan Rajevac, has publicly invited him to play for the country in next summer&rsquo;s World Cup. And the beginnings of a backlash against the abuse may be beginning. Some commentators are now calling for the 6ft 2in striker to be selected immediately for the Italian team.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry for Balotelli, he should be left alone to play football, but right now he is symbol of a cultural shift in Italy and a yardstick for whether we can make that change,&#8221; said Stella, the Corriere della Sera columnist.</p>
<p>Growing up in rich, industrial Brescia, the player became used to racial abuse during school matches, with parents pointing to his height and claiming &#8220;with these Africans you can never tell what age they really are&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mario always needed love and affection,&#8221; his adoptive sister Cristina told the French newspaper L&rsquo;Equipe. &#8220;He wouldn&rsquo;t go to sleep without his mother holding his hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the pitch as a professional, he has sometimes been unable to ignore the hostility from the stands. Faced with Roma fans who reportedly threw bananas at him in a bar, he stuck his tongue out at an opposition defender after scoring against them. For that, claimed the Roma captain Francesco Totti, he &#8220;deserved a slap&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a shame that everyone is more upset with me than with the people yelling at me,&#8221; replied Balotelli.</p>
<p>If Balotelli is indeed picked by Italian national coach Marcello Lippi to play in the World Cup next summer, the selection may signal a new era for black Italians. And as more and more of their white compatriots realise that the country&rsquo;s ethnic make-up is changing, support is at least beginning to emerge across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Balotelli is stubborn, combative and can be a bit of a bully, but at the same time he is generous, brave and irreverent,&#8221; said Fare Futuro, a think-tank run by the prominent centre right politician Gianfranco Fini. &#8220;He is pure talent. Genius and lack of restraint all in one. What else could be more Italian than that?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;the country&rsquo;s seeming inability to embrace a multi-ethnic identity&#8221;.  What&rsquo;s wrong with Italy embracing an ITALIAN identity?  Is there any country in black Africa that embraces a multi-ethnic identity that considers whites and Asians just as native as they are? It should also be considered that, with a birth-rate far below replacement level, Italy is especially susceptible to having it&rsquo;s population replaced by foreigners.</p>

		<p>The funny thing is no one mentions that Balotelli is a provocateur and deserves all the insults he gets. People hate him because he is haughty and immature.</p>
<p>At any rate - no, Africans cannot be Italian by definition. Italians are a European people.</p>

		<p>At the end of the colonial era whites mostly repatriated to their Western homeland, for instance the mass departure from the East Indies, Hong Kong and Africa.  White neo-colonial expats as a rule do not try to obtain passports today in Africa or Asia. </p>
<p>There is no reason why an African or a Chinese should receive a passport in countries they are historically alien to. Our laws must be changed to protect our indigenous genetic claim to Europe.</p>
<p>Because of our lax laws, Asians and Africans treat white countries as terris nullis, an undefended no-man&rsquo;s land open for conquest.</p>

		<p>You can NOT be black and Italian.  Or Chinese and Italian.  The Italians are in and of themselves an ethnic group.  An ethnic group indigenous to the Italian peninsula.  Asian-Italian?  Italy is not a nation of immigrants, as the libs like to say.<br>

<p>No, This is no short-coming of the country. The failure is on the part of racial marxists and multicultists who continually attack and undermine indigenous peoples. Balotelli is not <i>Italian</i> regardless of what his passport says. He entered the country illegally and he will never be legitimate.</p>

<p>Haha, is this really what liberals believe?  Trends so far suggest that the higher the minority population in any given European country, the more power the &#8220;far-rights&#8221; gets.  Le Pen almost won in France in 2004, and Sarkozy only got elected because he was Le Pen lite.  Nick Griffin is on the verge of a major breakthrough in the U.K. and who knows when Austria&rsquo;s FPO will get their act back together.</p>
<p>Blacks cannot be Italian because being an Italian is more than just holding Italian citizenship, it is being a member of the Italian ethnic group.</p>

<p>Some professor! Yes they will be lost. As the number of foreigners gets larger and they become more assertive the next stage is multiculturalism. That means recognition and government support for foreign cultures and traditions. It won&rsquo;t be very long before affirming Italian traditions will be called racism. Now that the professor has been corrected do you think he will change his opinion about admitting more foreigners or will he just come up with more excuses as needed?</p>

		<p>First of all, it is not his fault that he is in Italy. He was abandoned by his parents who returned to Africa. I would recommend that he immigrate to another country that would be more accepting of his skills. A good example would be Brazil. They have large Black population He would make their good team sensational. If I was him, I would learn Portuguese</p>

<p>Sounds like quite the burden.  And yet, oddly, the grass still doesn&rsquo;t seem greener in sub-Saharan Africa.  Does this constitute an admission that black in Italy is light years ahead of black in Africa?  It would seem so, which would in turn seem to be impetus for any man of honor to shut his face.</p>

		<p>The article is self-refuting in its attempts to portray the life of black people in Italy as hellish.</p>
<p>According to the article the worst examples of racial abuse in an African-Italian&rsquo;s life are:</p>
<p>-Being mistaken for a street vendor.<br>
-Being asked for papers.<br>
-People being confused about your age when you are a children (&ldquo;with these Africans you can never tell what age they really are&rdquo;)</p>
<p>You can infer Pap Khouma and Mario Balotelli were never physically attacked for their race, or targeted with other kinds of serious abuse.</p>

		<p>Will the Italians learn from the mistakes of the Romans? The Romans had prosperity, power, prestige, and sub-replacement birth rates. And they embraced civic nationalism: the idea that blood and heritage have nothing to do with national identity. They gave foreigners Roman citizenship all throughout the Empire. And do the Romans still exist? Does Roman today mean ancestry from Romulus and his tribesmen, or just a resident of the city of Rome? Italians need to understand the consequences of low birth rates and civic nationalism. </p>

		<p>The Italians are correct: Italy is not an idea nation.</p>
<p>Once you cross the the line into the idea nation realm&hellip;then it is a very short skip and a hop to:&#8221;America is an idea nation,not a race based nation idea, So what is the big deal if Whites become a racial minority?&#8221; The only defense against this is: Ameria is a race-based nation&hellip;.just like every other normal nation.</p>
<p>The idea nation types are liars. They understand and accept the fact that nations are race based in terms of national identity. Idea nation types hate European people and want very much to race-replace them as fast as possible. Get people to accept idea nation ideology. Then once non-whites are majority in formely majority European race-based nations-such as OUR AMERICA-call it a ball game on the idea nation nonsense and declare America a non-white nation. They are evil and can not be trusted.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that I will never recognize post-1965 Hispanics, Asians, Africans and Muslims as Americans.</p>
<p>I should point out that Roy Beck and numbersusa.com will not recognize the obvious fact that NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS exist and are experieincing the greatest harm from post-1965 nonwhite LEGAL IMMIGRANTS. This is just another way of saying that numbersusa.com is comfortable with race-replacement.</p>
<p>Numbersusa.com only opposes immigration because it supposedly harms post-1965 non-whites. Why do people send their money to this creepy organization? Send your money to AR and Vdare.com.</p>
<p>Keep the Africans out!!!</p>

<p>Could this be a prelude to a European Union directive to force Italy to accept more African immigrants and be sure to implement affirmative action for them?<br>

		<p>Italy is the defending World Cup champion.  It won with a team that was not only all-Italian (meaning all-white), but also only with players from the top Italian professional league Serie A.  Captain Fabio Cannavaro was voted FIFA World Player of the Year, rarely awarded to a defender.</p>
<p>The Ghanaian represents a risk to Italian football.  Often blacks physically mature quickly and show promise at the under-21 level.  Yet as they age they fail to develop conceptually and as team players.  Meanwhile white players not only develop physically to match their black counterparts but also in terms of overall understanding and effectiveness.  Promising blacks who are placed on national teams to avoid charges of racism become immovable fixtures as their skills decline, because they cannot be removed without accusations of racism.</p>
<p>Good deeds, adopting an abandoned African child and objectively recognizing athletic potential, rarely go unpunished.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the best running back in college football, Toby Gerhart, lost the Heisman Trophy to a reasonably good running back.  For some reason voters overlooked Gerhart&rsquo;s adoptive father being in prison and Gerhart having been abandoned by his Ghanaian parents.  The good news is the vote was the closest ever.  </p>

		<p>AS Roma fans have no business throwing bananas (or anything else) at Balotelli, given their own team&rsquo;s racial makeup. Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Roma#Current_squad" rel="nofollow">a quick glance at the roster</a> shows no Africans, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Okaka_Chuka" rel="nofollow">this player</a> turns out to be a &#8220;Balotellian&#8221; of Nigerian ancestry. They also have a black &#8220;Frenchman&#8221; and a couple of black Brazilians, along with a Ghanian out on loan. So much for my buying a Roma shirt. </p>
<p>Note to Ghana coach Milovan Rajevac: If you do take Balotelli, please take the <a>pseudo-American Freddy Adu</a> while you&rsquo;re at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;the country&rsquo;s seeming inability to embrace a multi-ethnic identity&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s wrong with Italy embracing an ITALIAN identity? Is there any country in black Africa that embraces a multi-ethnic identity that considers whites and Asians just as native as they are? It should also be considered that, with a birth-rate far below replacement level, Italy is especially susceptible to having it&rsquo;s population replaced by foreigners.</p>

		<p>If the Italians treat him so poorly he should do what his parents did&hellip;go find a better country to live in.  </p>
<p>Also, we are often told to feel sorry for third-world immigrants because they are just trying to find a better life for their children.  Obviously not the case if they abandon them at birth!</p>

		<p>  I don&rsquo;t see how one can be both black and Italian. Italians are not black. Take a trip to your local museum and look at Italian Renaissance pictures from Florence or antique busts from ancient Rome. Do these people look like black Africans? I&rsquo;m sorry that Mr. Balotelli was abandoned by his African parents in Italy, but that doesn&rsquo;t make him Italian anymore than being born in China makes a Caucasian a Han Chinese.</p>

		<p>He is an Italian citizen, raised in the Italian culture, but he is not ethnically Italian. His birth parents were immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, not descendants of ancient migrants from Europe and the Mediterranean basin. Sudtirolers are less culturally Italian than Balotelli, and Albanian or Romanian immigrants may not be Italian citizens, but they are ethnically much closer to Italians than is Balotelli.<br>
