</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carolyn Dempster, BBC News, December 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rape is endemic in South Africa.</p>
<p>On this the police, politicians, sociologists and rape survivors all agree. There is a silent war going on, a war against women and children.</p>
<p>It is a fact that a woman born in South Africa has a greater chance of being raped, than learning how to read.</p>
<p>One in four girls faces the prospect of being raped before the age of 16 according to the child support group, Childline.</p>
<p>Sexual violence pervades society, with one of the highest reported rates of rape in the world, and an alarmingly high incidence of domestic violence and child abuse.</p>
<p>The official crime statistics tell only part of the story.</p>
<p>In 1994, the year South Africa became a democracy, 18,801 cases of rape were reported. By 2001 that figure had risen to 24,892.</p>
<p>The South African Police Service readily admits that even though there is now a greater awareness of the problem, more stringent penalties, and better policing, the vast majority of rapes and attempted rapes still go unreported and unpunished.</p>
<p>During a recent parliamentary debate on child abuse in South Africa, it was reported that there has been a 400% increase in the sexual violence against children over the past decade.</p>
<p><b>Baby rape</b></p>
<p>The majority of the victims are 12 years old or younger. Many of the perpetrators are themselves children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby Tshepang&#8221; was just 9 months old when she was brutally raped in the Northern Cape town of Louisvale in the early hours of 27 October, 2001.</p>
<p>Baby rape is not a new phenomenon in South African society, but it is becoming more common.</p>
<p>One possible reason, say Aids activists, is the myth, widespread in southern Africa, that sex with a child or baby will rid a man of HIV or Aids.</p>
<p>South Africa already has more than 4.5 million people living with HIV, more than any other country in the world.</p>
<p>As the HIV pandemic becomes an Aids pandemic, rape can also be a death sentence.</p>
<p>So why is it so bad?</p>
<p>At the root of the problem, says Dr Rachel Jewkes, a senior scientist with the South African Medical Research Council, is men&rsquo;s attitude towards women.</p>
<p>&#8220;In South Africa you have a culture where men believe that they are sexually entitled to women. You don&rsquo;t get rape in a situation where you don&rsquo;t have massive gender inequalities.</p>
<p>One of the key problems in this country is that people who commit rape don&rsquo;t think they are doing anything wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Can&rsquo;t say no&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Her findings are borne out by the experience of Rose Tamae, a survivor of gang rape, who is HIV positive, and counsels abused women and children in the sprawling township of Orange Farm which lies across the highway from Soweto, west of Johannesburg.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our culture, as a woman, you don&rsquo;t say no to a man. Sex is not open for discussion,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they think they can do as they like.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a place like Orange Farm, where most people are unemployed, and the women have to go looking for work far away, often the children are left at home in the care of men, or strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are vulnerable. In one case a little girl was being given food in return for sex, and she didn&rsquo;t want to go home empty-handed to her mother, who had Aids and was sick. &#8220;</p>
<p><b>Apartheid legacy</b></p>
<p>A &#8220;culture of violence&#8221; has also been a dominant feature of South African society for decades, say sociologists, and it has spawned attitudes which are tolerant of sexual violence.</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s Deputy President Jacob Zuma blames apartheid for &#8220;sowing the seeds for the breakdown of the institution of the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>He believes that the molestation of children and infants today is a symptom of this degeneration.</p>
<p>Apartheid HAS left a damaged society in its wake, but the criminal justice system is also failing women and children in South Africa.</p>
<p>Out of the 24,892 rapes reported last year, only 1,797 resulted in successful convictions.</p>
<p>To its credit the government, and South African society, is responding to the scourge.</p>
<p>The justice system has prioritised sexual offences with a review of the law and stiffer sentences.</p>
<p>Police officers are being trained to care for rape survivors.</p>
<p>Many private hospitals now offer specialized rape care and counselling, and insurance companies have introduced policies for rape survivors to enable them to afford expensive anti-retroviral drug treatment to reduce the risk of contracting HIV and Aids.<br>

		<p>This has to be one of the most utterly vomititious pieces I&rsquo;ve ever read.  Rape in SA is a legacy of apartheid??!! The black Africans of SA imported this cultural tendency from the white South Africans?</p>
<p>All we&rsquo;re witnessing in that tragic land is the return of the blacks to their true nature without the inhibitions of white rule. In case nobody noticed, this is how black Africans behave anywhere in the world once white cultural and social control is eclipsed by black rule.</p>
<p>Any white who doubts this needs only to walk unarmed and unescorted through any black neighborhood in this country, or in Jamaica, Haiti, Belize, Brazil, anyplace at all in which blacks have become the controlling faction.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In South Africa you have a culture where men believe that they are sexually entitled to women&#8221;</p>
<p>All men have that sense, but men of other races have adapted a more discriminating internal impulse control.  </p>
<p>The African, in his jungle environment, adapted in a manner which suits his genetic survival.  In the absence of external controls, he follows his ancient primal nature.</p>

		<p>It is most certainly NOT a silent war.  You can be certain that plenty of screams rend the air, and much weeping wets the ground - along with the blood that is being spilled there every day.  </p>
<p>The deafness to those screams, and the willful blindness to the horror that is South Africa today do not make the strife there &#8220;silent&#8221;.    </p>
<p>The only silence here is the deafening silence of those who had so much to say in their fever to force South Africa into this situation, only broken to spew dirty lies like:  &#8220;At the root of the problem is men&rsquo;s attitudes towards women&#8221;.   </p>
<p>That false statement condemns all men, implicitly including White men (probably still the majority of the BBC audience).   Later in the article, Zuma is quoted making  the false accusation explicit, blaming apartheid -  that is: White men - for the current pandemic of terrible crimes committed by Black men (and boys).  </p>
<p>The only role Apartheid plays in this is like that of a shark cage badly needed, but long since forsworn, for &#8220;At the root of the problem is&#8221; : Black African men.   White men do not behave that way.   Women are treated better in White society than anywhere else.     </p>
<p>There is some truth-telling in this article.  The victim Rose Tamae names &#8220;our culture&#8221;.  She is referring to non-white culture.  White societies where rape rates have skyrocketed in recent years have non-white immigrants to thank for it.  <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m getting sick and tired of hearing black Africans blame apartheid for their own crimes.  Rape is a serious problem wherever blacks are found in large numbers.  It&rsquo;s a serious problem all over black Africa, the Caribbean and black areas of America.  Each of those areas differ in history, culture, language, religion and politics; the only common denominator is race.</p>

<p>LIE!  SA was a democracy as an independent country, as a Dominion and as a colony.  Parliment has been an elected body for a mucho-long time.  Democracy does not mean universal sufferage.  in fact universal sufferage is more likely to wreck a country than help it.</p>

		<p>As usual, the SA government responds to crime with more laws. This accomplishes nothing.  We already had laws against rape.  What we need is enforcement.</p>
<p>When they were a terrorist organization in opposition, the ANC adopted a strategy of &#8220;making the country ungovernable&#8221;. Now that they are the government, they are sticking with the strategy that worked so well for them in the past.</p>

		<p>something is just profoundly wrong about blacks in South Africa. Rural Africans in traditional societies may not be civil virtue paragons, but the majority of them don&rsquo;t live in habitual lawlessness. Even in the relatively lawless American inner cities they know that there are crimes and then there are CRIMES. They may deal drugs and kill fellow gangsters, but they don&rsquo;t run around raping little kids and so forth. If anything, I would imagine that the truly and blatantly lawless would be killed by their fellow homies much faster than any police response.</p>
<p>Well, so whatever the reason, something is clearly unusual and wrong in SA. I would imagine that in the past they could be very brutal to enemy tribes, before Europeans suppressed warfare. But lawlessness to your own neighbors and tribes would not have been tolerated. But now, do they have any notion of loyalty and civil society left at all?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s a question. What&rsquo;s the rape rate in the rest of sub-saharan Africa. I&rsquo;ve never seen any good statistics. </p>
<p>Do we never hear much about it because these societies are too disorganized to report any numbers? Or is it actually lower? </p>
<p>Is South Africa really the &#8216;rape capital&rsquo; of the world? Or is it just the only sub-saharan African country with the infrastructure left to make an effort at gathering statistics on the problem? </p>
<p>If the rape rate in, say, Nigeria is higher would anyone say that apartheid was to blame for South Africa&rsquo;s lower rape rate?  </p>

<p>If Apartheid was so damaging, why were blacks from all over Africa illegally immigrating into SA all the while it was in place? If Apartheid must be examined, why not examine this? Also, might the population explosion itself be the cause. And why not a fuller account of reality in this BBC &#8216;news&rsquo; story? The existence of such a &#8216;selective&rsquo; memory by he press and an equally &#8216;selective&rsquo; outlook held by the citizens of SA, may have as much to do with the rape crisis as does the legacy of Apartheid. But then again, if this were true, and publicly acknowledged (the lefts selective amnesia), this too would be blamed on the &#8216;legacy of Apartheid&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>I note this article was written in 2002, so the reported incidents of rape has surely increased in the past few years. It&rsquo;s probably around 50,000 per year now.</p>
<p>Once again, apartheid is made the scapegoat for sexual practices and attitudes in South Africa. EVEN IF THAT WERE TRUE, how does it explain the rape rates in other African countries south of Algeria, which never had apartheid? Places like Sudan, Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Angola? It doesn&rsquo;t explain the rape rates among Bantus in North America, South America, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Something else must be at work here. What could it be? Cultural attitudes towards rape? </p>
<p>How can that be, if all cultures are equal? <br>

		<p>This is a horrible nightmare but I don&rsquo;t know the true cause to these effects. Whites that have lived there&hellip; given they were balanced minded would obviously have a better opinion I&rsquo;d be happy to hear. One thing that does come to my mind though is I see very little excellence in the way of self help amongst the black race for their own even with the endless avenues of help from the white world for the past hundred yrs or more. Amongst all cultures there are different stratas or castes&hellip; surely between blacks this exists&hellip; so why would the white South Africans who at least created higher culture if not equal access be responsible for black on black evil? The saying.. you can&rsquo;t keep a good man down&hellip;has some merrit, doesn&rsquo;t this apply to a people as well?</p>

The military have to attend these farces too, yet only need qualify with their weapons once a year.

<p>we need to protect ourselves, and worry later about how to get blacks to stop abusing one another.</p>

<p>I would respectfully disagree with that. A friend who served his internship in the Emergency Room ( formerly called the Accident Dispensary) at the Hospital of Temple University in  North Philadelphia told many tales of infants and little girls being brought in who had been raped. <br>

		<p>One-fourth of SA women are likely to be raped?  But, wait&hellip;isn&rsquo;t that the percentage the cultural left quotes for the U.S.?  Of course, here, that number probably includes sexual assaults like a man pinching a woman&rsquo;s butt.  <br>
Were women and children being raped wholesale in SA under white rule?  It&rsquo;s a fact that&rsquo;s been stated and restated: black rule=crime wave.  The left simply won&rsquo;t discuss the fact because it can&rsquo;t be explained away; its denizens merely gasp, &#8220;That&rsquo;s racist!&#8221; and go mum.  </p>

		<p>Of course Zuma fails to state just how apartheid caused such a breakdown in the institution of the family. And a moments reflection on the nature of apartheid reveals why he could not do so. Apartheid, unlike slavery, does not break up families or otherwise effect the institution of family in that its purpose is to simply ensure seperate living by each race. Thus apartheid allowed blacks to develop along their natural inclinations. White law and culture did have an ameilorating effect on that  natural development. Once white authority was significantly reduced blacks simply reverted fully to form.</p>

		<p>I am a white South African and I have lived both under the Apartheid government and the new &#8220;free&#8221; South Africa.</p>
<p>Under apartheid we had nearly no crime. Burglar bars on windows were science fiction.</p>
<p>The statement above is only correct in that only the white areas had nearly no crime. The crime that did occur was committed by blacks mostly in black neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>When apartheid fell, the blacks brought the crime with them to the white neighbourhoods.<br>
The word &#8220;apartheid&#8221; translated into English means segregation.</p>
<p>As the number of black immigrants in the USA and Europe starts to increase, the whites will begin to realize why segregation is necessary. </p>
<p>The whites in South Africa today still do just about zero crime. Crime is a black problem. Blacks have always committed more crime than whites and it is genetic. The crime has escalated since 1994 though and it is caused because all the blacks thought that once apartheid ended they would move into the white neighbourhoods, get the white wife, BMW and the nice job as an Engineer.</p>
<p>They quickly found out that education isn&rsquo;t just a word that whites use to oppress blacks. </p>
<p>Blacks were quick to say that the apartheid government denied them educations. This is called blame shifting and is easily negated by the fact that 19 years after the release of Mandela even less blacks are managing to get through school than did so under apartheid. Where are the eager, fresh black minds making use of the so called educational freedom. The number of black school leavers have dropped significantly. The reason is IQ.</p>
<p>Crime is the number one cause of racism in South Africa.<br>
Crime is a black problem.<br>
Crime is what caused Verwoerd in his day to implement apartheid.</p>
<p>You guys in the first world will have to learn this lesson still and it is going to be a tough lesson.</p>
<p>In the mean time more whites in South Africa are killed daily, that troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>During apartheid the president at the time, Verwoerd ensured that every ethic group had a &#8220;homeland&#8221; where they could rule themselves and just be themselves culturally.</p>
<p>Oh, how us whites wish that the blacks would return the favour and grant us a homeland where we may be safe.  </p>

		<p>South African Apartheid, like American Segregation, served to keep the Races separate, which would avoid what we see now, which is an epidemic of brutal Black Jungle behavior.</p>
<p>People ridiculed men like Bull Connor, and Alabama Governor, George Wallace, that were staunch advocates of Segregation. Their counterparts in Rhodesia, like Ian Smith, and Jan Smuts, in South Africa, knew too well what the nature of Blacks would be, if they were allowed to integrate into the greater White Society.</p>
<p>It seems, tragically, that they were proved right.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Apartheid&#8221; had NOTHING to do with black behavior beyond keeping the &#8220;normally warring&#8221; tribes from slaughtering each other.<br>
During the &#8220;apartheid&#8221; era, there was massive black immigration into South Africa.  Even with &#8220;apartheid&#8221; in place, blacks found life in South Africa to be much better than anywhere else in Africa.<br>
When &#8220;apartheid&#8221; was abolished and black radical communism became the &#8220;law of the land&#8221; the handwriting was on the wall as far as South African whites were concerned.</p>

I&rsquo;m getting sick and tired of hearing black Africans blame apartheid for their own crimes. Rape is a serious problem wherever blacks are found in large numbers. It&rsquo;s a serious problem all over black Africa, the Caribbean and black areas of America. Each of those areas differ in history, culture, language, religion and politics; the only common denominator is race.<br>

<p>So I&rsquo;m the boogey man???<br>
hahahaha</p>
<p>What you must do is irrelevant, because you will continue to do what you are doing right now. So continue to feel guilty and see your society slip down the toilet in due time.</p>
<p>And belief me it is coming. Thus you will only get what you deserve.</p>
<p>Here are some facts about South Africa.</p>
<p>1) Crime was lower under apartheid.<br>
2) Each ethnic group had their own country.<br>
(Google it and check rain fall figures and you&rsquo;ll see that they had the most fertile lands)<br>
3) SA had about 2 million tax payers(whites) and 30 million blacks who paid no income tax at all.<br>
4) With the money from this small income pool they had to try and uplift all the black masses.<br>
5) The blacks demanded free houses etc. They had and still have a culture of entitlement.<br>
6) The apartheid government had policies of enticing entrepreneurs to set up shop in the black countries, by special tax rebates etc. All this so that there would be employment for the blacks in their own countries.<br>
7) BUT these countries consistently failed to develop when  left to their own devices and the blacks would eventually gyrate back to the white areas in search of employment. This was because of the fact that their numbers swelled due to the increased life expectancy under apartheid.<br>
https://www.news24.com/Content/SouthAfrica/News/1059/f42a1a2a96084d228497288466a7fb95/27-07-2004-07-40/Life_expectancy_down_<br>
https://news.iafrica.com/sa/1106301.htm<br>
Since apartheid has ended the black life expectancy has dropped. Blacks lived longer under apartheid.<br>
8) The blacks were always uneducated. The apartheid government tried to educate them.<br>
9)  The ANC told the blacks that they were victims and who can forget the black slogan of liberation before education.<br>
10) The Afrikaners were also dirt poor once, after the Boer, English war. We had our farms confiscated by the English and thus had to work in the mines, but through the slogan of <br>
&#8220;Liberation through education&#8221; we took the country back after one generation without firing a shot.</p>
<p><br>
Contrast that to the ANC. I often wondered why the black would burn down their schools every year before the final exams. I could only shake my head at the stupidity of destroying the only vessel of true liberation.</p>
<p>Only education set you free, otherwise you have to do what the blacks are masters at and that is to RE-distribute wealth. Nice words for legally stealing.</p>
<p>11) Less blacks are getting through school today than did so under apartheid.</p>
<p>12) YOU WILL LOSE YOUR COUNTRY IN TIME, BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY.<br>
13) This you deserve, because you belief the lies told to you by your mass media.</p>

		<p>What has changed in SA besides the ending of Apartheid? If sex crime is caused by Apartheid shouldn&rsquo;t it be going down now that Apartheid no longer exists?</p>
<p>In school I remember we had this big section in class called &#8216;the feminization of poverty&rsquo;. The idea being poverty is becoming almost entirely female (at least that&rsquo;s the only thing we should be concerned about) and this is a reality being enforced by conservative bigotry. There were all kinds of figures proving this. It read much like this news report. The only change in society during the time in question, however, was societies widespread and universal acceptance of &#8216;feminism&rsquo;, and indeed the implementation of all it&rsquo;s goals. Even if one believes the premise (which I certainly didn&rsquo;t), the &#8216;root cause&rsquo; (and don&rsquo;t they just love to get to root causes) could be nothing other than feminism itself. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to see someone who has lived &#8220;in the trenches&#8221;, so to speak, in both the old and the &#8220;new&#8221; South Africa, because you are able to tell it like it really is; so we don&rsquo;t have to listen to some college student from Berkeley prattle on how &#8220;evil&#8221; apartheid is, when that student can&rsquo;t locate the Transvaal on a map.</p>
<p>I just have a couple of questions for you, SA Afrikaner:</p>
<p>1. Didn&rsquo;t Daniel F. Malan promulgate apartheid, (around 1950) so that by the time Hendrik Verwoerd became PM, apartheid was already well established?</p>
<p>2. Isn&rsquo;t it spelled &#8220;Afrikaaner&#8221;, after the South African Dutch language?</p>

<p>All of what was once White, Christian homelands are under attack.  I have followed SA news for some time now and my heart truly bleeds for you and your fellows.  I know that asking you to leave for North America is somewhat like jumping from the frying pan to the fire but perhaps if enough of you came here (US) you might have significant effect on our policies and would at least build your people a new homeland.  To that end, do you know if white immigration to the US is happening in any numbers and are you being discouraged from coming here by our present government?</p>

Some of us have been stupid Americans and simply because we&rsquo;ve allowed it to happen. We&rsquo;ve let our school systems stupify us and our children. We&rsquo;ve allowed our mass media to hide the truth about what&rsquo;s been going on in this country for many years.  Yes, there are many Americans whose wives and daughters have been raped/ raped and murdered but for years it&rsquo;s been easily hidden here due to the vastness of the country. I&rsquo;ve seen the SA Sucks website and have been horrified by the images of the nude bodies of women who had been raped and mutilated. The images continue to haunt me and they&rsquo;re being acted out here in places like Wichita, Knoxville, Philadelphia, Little Rock and countless others.  The Internet has opened our eyes to the genocide being perpetrated against White people here because we now have access to the online editions of newspapers from all over the nation.  <br>
