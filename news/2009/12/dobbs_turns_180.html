<h1>Hard-Line Immigration Group Pulls Backing From Dobbs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Foon Rhee, Boston Globe, December 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs became a hero in some quarters  &mdash;  and reviled in others  &mdash;  for his outspokenness on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>But now a leading group on the issue is withdrawing its support  &mdash;  including taking down websites urging Dobbs to run for president in 2012  &mdash;  because it says he has changed his tune.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the Telemundo interview late last month, Dobbs was asked how he would fix the immigration system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a rational, effective and humane immigration policy in this country,&#8221; he said. Dobbs also said, &#8220;We need the ability to legalize illegal immigrants on certain conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he said, &#8220;We need to be able to influence the direction of the conversation toward securing the border because until we can control immigration, we cannot meaningfully, substantively alter immigration law because it would have no point if we cannot establish the basis for the control of the flow of people across that border.&#8221;</p>
<p>ALIPAC [Americans for Legal Immigration PAC] said it is suspending the operations of two Dobbs fan websites, including one that it says had raised more than $660,000 for a possible candidacy and another on Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve received so many demands from prior Dobbs supporters to remove their pledges of support that we have to suspend all operations on the Dobbs fan sites,&#8221; Gheen added. &#8220;Lou Dobbs has deeply offended his base of supporters and ALIPAC is going to remain loyal to those Americans who support our existing immigration laws instead of amnesty disguised as reform.&#8221;<br>

								<h2>Dobbs Turns 180 on Amnesty Stance, Loses ALIPAC Support</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Chad Groening, OneNewsNow, December 7, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A grassroots immigration enforcement advocacy organization is withdrawing its support for Lou Dobbs&rsquo; possible presidential bid after the former CNN anchor and commentator told a Spanish language television network that he now supports amnesty for illegal aliens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But recently Dobbs created shockwaves when he told Telemundo that he now supports the idea of providing a so-called &#8220;pathway to citizenship for millions of illegals.&#8221;</p>
<p>William Gheen (ALIPAC  &mdash;  Americans for Legal Immigration PAC)William Gheen, president of ALIPAC, explains why the organization is appalled by his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lou Dobbs went on Telemundo Network on November 20th, and the full copy of the interview we got had him talking about a form of amnesty or path to citizenship for illegal aliens on several occasions,&#8221; Gheen explains. &#8220;He also apologized for not speaking Spanish to the audience and a bunch of other stuff that we saw as surrender and capitulation, especially considering that the La Raza pro-amnesty groups are now celebrating his departure from CNN. He also went on to say he doesn&rsquo;t support deportation. He didn&rsquo;t say he didn&rsquo;t support mass deportations, he said he doesn&rsquo;t support deportation at all.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I hear one hour of his radio show (his competition is worse) during the week.  He is a two-faced race traitor who will say anything he needs to to stay in the public eye.  He has no core beliefs and quite frankly (I feel) no love for his country or her people.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a faithful Lou Dobbs listener and supporter for years. After his Telemundo interview, I was surprised and terribly disappointed. He insisted later that he hasn&rsquo;t changed his stand on illegal immigration, but never have I heard him say he was for legalizing the millions who&rsquo;ve invaded our country.He did an about face several weeks before he left CNN. Talk about the invasion stopped almost completely and when he had to refer to illegal aliens - as he always had - he called them &#8220;illegal mmigrants.&#8221; Then, when he left the channel, I thought he&rsquo;s speak up somewhere else, perhaps Fox, but no&hellip; he went on Telemundo to apologize to the woman who interviewed him. I don&rsquo;t understand what happened. I know La Raza and other anti-American groups were trying to have him fired. Instead of making his words more meaninful, he capitulated to the enemy. I&rsquo;m so sorry. He was one of the few who spoke out for our country. Now, he would like to legalize those who&rsquo;ve broken our laws. I&rsquo;d love to know what caused this abrupt change. If he were a politician, I&rsquo;d say for a pay off or future votes, but maybe this is the prelude to a try for a Senate seat. If so, he does NOT have my vote.</p>

I often wondered why CNN let Mr. Dobbs speak out as he did on illegal immigration and I now believe Mr. Dobbs was used by CNN to attract the &#8216;angry, white American&rsquo; demographic and he was in on all of it.</p>
<p>Notice how Mr. Dobbs quit after his house was fired on? I suspect Mr. Dobbs thought he was only playing a provocateur on TV but when others in the pro-illegal movement took him seriously and shot at his house, he realized it wasn&rsquo;t a show and decided to leave.<br>

		<p>I never did trust this guy.  He worked for CNN forEVER - and there is no way he could have stayed there all that time and not be a lib at heart.  I would like to see him have to live for one month in the heart of Pomona or Ontario, CA.  THEN let&rsquo;s hear his statement on immigration&hellip;.</p>

<p>WE have always had a rational, effective and human policy toward immigration. Get in line, wait your turn, do it legally. What more could there be or should there be. The U.S. is more than generous with immigrants, always has been and always will be. What is not accepted is the line jumpers, the illegals, the scofflaws, etc. </p>
<p>NO problem with immigration, just do it orderly, peacefully, legally! NOT too much to ask!!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a safe bet that any MSM personality out there, and that includes talk radio, are fakes.  Lou Dobbs, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mike Huckabee, Glen Beck, Bill O&rsquo;reilly, etc. are controlled opposition to act as safety valves for angry White Americans to let off some steam.  Plus they can make money hocking their stupid books to an ignorant public.  I will even go so far as to say that many if not most of their callers are station employees or some other paid stooges with a script to keep the conversations from veering off into topics they don&rsquo;t want to talk about.  </p>

		<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t get all this new hatred for Lou Dobbs on Amren.  This guy was on for years blasting mexicans et al. in a time slot where older Americans, probably the only real CNN fans, could watch.</p>
<p>If you never heard that stuff, you don&rsquo;t have elderly parents as I do.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s now a &#8220;turncoat&#8221;; I agree, but, he did some good over his years.  Undoubtedly more than most posters here.</p>

		<p>What a disappointment. Dobbs was the voice of countless fed-up whites, who took on the immigration mess and dared put illegals front and center. Maybe those bullet holes in his walls hit a little too close to home, literally? You&rsquo;re done, Lou, you coulda been a contender&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs is a bombastic megalmniac and fraud. He makes an enormous amount of noise about outsourcing American jobs. Does a big town hall meeting on the issue in a Ohio town. At the start of this &#8220;town hall debate&#8221;, Dobbs announces that real world realism requires that the White Ohioans who have been harmed by job outsourcing should should give up on their dream of a protectionist trade policy. We have to live in the real world children, after all. This could have easily come out of the mouth the traitor Hillary Clinton(worlds ugliest secretary of state among other things). What was the point then of even having this &#8220;town hall meeting&#8221;? It was nothing more than a huge venue for Dobbs to express his masive meglamania.</p>
<p>Dobbs is also known to be a bullying thug to his &#8220;inferiors&#8221; in his group over at CNN.</p>
<p>Lou Dobbs dumped his White Wife for a young hot Latina who he later had children with. He has committed race treason against his own kind. All that matters for Lou is Lou. If is good for Lou, its good for America.</p>
<p>Never trust a man who puts yellow dye number 7 in his hair before going on TV live. Dobbs is a loathsome creature.</p>
<p>Numbersusa.com still won&rsquo;t mention the fact that White Americans exist and are being harmed by post-1965 non-whites. </p>

		<p>I wonder what would possess Lou Dobbs to turn in the opposite direction. He had a very large audience on CNN due to his outspoken position on the illegal alien issue. He was pracitically the voice of the anti-illegal alien movement. Now he supports legalizing illegal aliens, which makes absolutely no sense to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps Lou Dobbs is just an opportunist without priciples.</p>

		<p>Today, Dobbs has neocon opportunist Andrew Breitbart on distracting everyone with &#8220;climategate&#8221;.  All this clutter about ACORN, global warming, health care, etc. is a distraction from the destruction of our nation.  My God, I&rsquo;m listening to Breitbart on Dobbs right now go off on moslems (big surprise, huh?). Now moslems are a huge problem, but they are a fly in the pasture compared to mexican and caribbean black immivasion.  Lou is just dancing to the tune of his puppet masters.</p>

		<p>It is a mistake to look for a Dear Leader to get us out of this mess. American Renassaince should be the alternative media for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. This is where your $$$$$$$$$$ should go. It was foolish to think that a corporate conglomerate-Time Warner -would tolerate Lou Dobbs for very long.</p>
<p>Ron Paul will not save NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS from race-replacement. He will greatly accelerate race-replacement with a massive increase in LEGAL IMMIGRANTION. Anyone who thinks the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS will be halted by pushing free market capitalism is a fool-a very big one at that. Free market capitalism as a rallying cry for milllions of struggling NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS is uninspiring drek.</p>
<p>The Tea Party protesters are fools. Most NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS will not go along with this Ron Paul front group. The Tea Party protests are last ditch attempt of Ron Paul supporters to channel growing fear of race-replacment among NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAS into a Ron Paul Libertarian polical movement that will rapidly accelerate the race-replacement of the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN population through LEGAL IMMIGRATION. You can see it  comming: The TV interview with the leader of the TEA PARTY movement:&#8221;It is not about race. WE are not opposed to LEGAL IMMMIGRATION.&#8221; More revolting &#8220;We are not racist&#8221; nonesense from a brain-dead libertarian &#8220;populist&#8221; revolt. </p>
<p>White Nationalism is the uncomproising(let the Republican party croak Peter Brimlow). White Nationalism is the complete rejection of the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. This has to be the starting point of the revolt against race-replacement. It has to be-as the left is so found of saying-an anti-totalatrian grasroots RACIALIST revolt from the bottom&hellip;this means professional politicians are not welcomed.</p>
<p>When enough NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS start thinking differently, the whole system will collapse and be wiped away.</p>

		<p>Next year  Americans had better be on their guard against fraudulent voter registrations and the possibility of illegal immigrants voting in the 2010 Senate elections. Sen.Harry Reid (D-NV) comes up for re-election and if you didn&rsquo;t know already, the great state of Nevada is overwhelmed by foreign nationals of the illegal kind. Be aware that under current voting law, a  &mdash;  UTILITY BILL  &mdash;   is officially identified as a legal document as identification in Nevada. In states that are heavily involved with illegal immigrants and the product of welfare fraud, Nevada and California specifically should be under the eye of the election authorities. As of now only contractors and subs are required to use E-Verify, which is very loosely audited. E-Verify must be enacted permanently as its success rate is progressively  moving forward. E-Verify could be introduced to identify drivers license applicants, car registration, health care and even voter registrations. Then organizations that facilitate in suspicious activities would have a major obstacle to contend with, including fraudulent documentation.</p>
<p>During this ACORN controversy these two Western states have very large apportionment&rsquo;s of political illegal immigrant sympathizers and  &mdash;  MUST  &mdash;  be removed from their career seats.  ACORN and its big brother SEIU. ACORN and SEIU are the lead organizations behind Health Care and Comprehensive Immigration Reform known in truth as AMNESTY, which is the principle entities aggressively shoving for the passage of these very serious issues. ACORN is better known for hiring people with questionable backgrounds, to be engaged in fraudulent voting registrations. Sen.Harry Reid, Speaker Pelosi can be attributed to the near destruction of E-Verify, the federal verification program that a growing number of nationwide employers are beginning to use. As a pro-illegal immigrant incumbent he must be ejected from his Senatorial seat, because he is directly involved in the 2010 Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill.These are the worst of the worst with  a grading  of ( F ) - as according to NUMBERSUSA.</p>
<p>They have been adamant conspirators against any immigration enforcement and readily agreeable with another BLANKET AMNESTY. WE NEED TO MAKE EXAMPLES OF THEM AND THROW THE IDIOTS OUT OF OFFICE NEXT YEAR?  These individuals are just part of the political conspirators who don&rsquo;t mind illegal aliens settling in our nation and stealing AMERICAN JOBS.<br>

<p>Statement from Gov. Jim Gibbons &#8220;Our voting system is very simply the greatest in the world and is the basis of what makes this country great. The allegation that an organization that&rsquo;s main purpose is to register new voters was doing so fraudulently is very troubling. I believe that requiring a photo ID to vote is a very reasonable protection for our voting system and should be enacted as law by the 2009 Legislature.&#8221;</p>
<p>We should endeavor to recruit high echelon tradesman and  intelligencer who have grand offerings to America in sort after skills, but not people who are desperate to infiltrate the welfare entitlements and become a public burden. There are estimates of over 8 million foreign nationals in the job force, that would be swallowed up expeditiously by those here legally and citizens.</p>
<p>Those who believe in America&rsquo;s survival, without OVERPOPULATION as stated by the US Census bureau better read facts at NUMBERSUSA not the lies spawned by open border entities. Those who want details of corruption in WASHINGTON and state government go to JUDICIAL WATCH. Overpopulation, traffic chaos,  infrastructure erosion should go to CAPSWEB. Other sites of interest on Immigration enforcement is ALIPAC and AMERICAN PATROL. We the people have the ultimate power to throw out anti-sovereignty incumbent politicians. Call and command these do-nothings to  &mdash;  STOP  &mdash;  this travesty at 202-224-3121.<br>

		<p>#17: Calm down, son. Ron Paul may have to make public statements that seem pro-immigration. But you need to stop your girly hysteria and keep your eye on the ball. The small FedGov that Paul advocates would be very unfriendly to welfare-dependent immigrants. His strict Constitutional principles are based on The Federalist Papers understanding of America as only suitable for the white descendants of white Europeans. </p>

Yes, Numbersusa.com is still a solid group and they have done excellent work in the past. The group just takes great pains to say &#8220;we&rsquo;re not racist&#8221; and they only do work on immigration. Fair enough.</p>
<p>The best part about Numbersusa is they have an excellent - get the word out internet fax system. WN need something like this.</p>
<p>Numbersusa allows supporters to send out unique, PERSONAL faxes for free to key people, it&rsquo;s not spam, not the same old, same RIGHT WING CONSERVATIVES who send petitions, mass post cards to CONGRESS that are never read and have little impact.</p>
<p>We need to learn from NUMBERSUSA and do similar effective activism.</p>

		<p>The Tea Parties are Ron Paul front groups&hellip;? Newt Gingrich is more like it. The Ron Paul supporters group is the Campaign for Liberty of which I am an active member. I agree that open borders would be disatrous but if you take away the welfare, they&rsquo;ll stop coming anyway. To make changes takes groups of people and I don&rsquo;t agree with total free markets, but I&rsquo;ll take one disagreement with four or five solid agreements.</p>

		<p>I never believed for a minute that Lou Dobbs was on our side especially with him being married to a Mexican.  These people are nothing more than entertainers trying to carve out a niche for themselves and rake in some cash.  If Dobbs is serious about running for office I doubt that anyone would trust him at this point, including the ones who were cheering over his dismissal at CNN.  If you want to find a candidate that is the enemy of the establishment then forget about the Dobbs, Palins, Huckabees and Romneys of the world.  These people are marionettes of the international cabal.  Focus on someone who doesn&rsquo;t get much publicity, those are their real enemies.  People like Ron Paul who will bring the troops home, poke AIPAC in the eye, shut down the Federal Reserve and put Bernanke &amp; Co in prison.   </p>
