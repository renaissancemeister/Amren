<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6945883.ece">Equality Quango Staff Rebel Over BNP &#8216;Sting&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Leppard, Times of London, December 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>TREVOR PHILLIPS is facing renewed turmoil at the government&rsquo;s equality watchdog after his staff revolted against a proposed &#8220;sting&#8221; to expose racism in the British National party (BNP).</p>
<p>Phillips, the chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, was forced to sanction an internal investigation after executives criticised the entrapment campaign, claiming it was &#8220;illegal, unethical and unprofessional&#8221;.</p>
<p>Insiders at the commission say three regional executives were asked to find black and Asian &#8220;agents&#8221; who would approach BNP councillors with purported complaints about poor council services.</p>
<p>The executives were also asked to recruit &#8220;agent provocateurs&#8221; from ethnic minority groups to apply for membership of the far-right party.</p>
<p>In both cases the commission&rsquo;s apparent aim was to gather evidence of the BNP&rsquo;s racism, to prove that it discriminates against non-whites by refusing them party membership and failing to tackle their grievances about local problems.</p>
<p>The BNP plot has infuriated some commission staff, who said it had put them at risk of reprisals from the far-right party. It will refocus attention on Phillips&rsquo;s troubled stewardship of the super-quango, which was set up two years ago to merge the government&rsquo;s race, equal opportunities and disability watchdogs.</p>
<p>Kay Hampton, one of six commissioners to quit this year, described Phillips&rsquo;s leadership style as &#8220;better suited to a political organisation than a human rights one&#8221;.</p>
<p>He has also alienated many left-wingers in the race relations lobby with his outspoken critique of Labour&rsquo;s multiculturalist agenda.</p>
<p>The new row came to light in July as the commission was preparing a High Court action against the BNP&rsquo;s constitution, which barred ethnic minorities from membership.</p>
<p>The rise of the BNP since its success at the European elections in June has set alarm bells ringing at the commission.</p>
<p>According to commission officials, Tim Wainwright, the commission&rsquo;s director of regions, held a telephone conference call on July 10 with three executives in charge of its operations in the south of England, the west Midlands and northern England.</p>
<p>One official said: &#8220;They were asked to find members of the minority community to go and join the BNP and to complain to BNP councillors about the quality of local services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Legally it was just not right. They were asked to do it and they refused.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another source added: &#8220;They were instructed to get ethnic minorities to join the BNP. Once their membership was refused, they should persuade them to complain against the BNP and ask the commission to take legal action. This was clearly an example of deliberate entrapment.&#8221;</p>
<p>A commission insider said there were now concerns that those asked to take part in the operation could be exposed to reprisals from supporters of the BNP. &#8220;They are worried about their security, they think anything could happen,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Clifford Stewart, head of the commission&rsquo;s operations for the south of England, who was present during the conference call, said he could not discuss the matter in detail because it was under investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything did happen, then it was unauthorised and nobody acted on it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In a statement this weekend, the commission said it was never its policy to encourage anyone to join the BNP.</p>
<p>It said: &#8220;The commission has never authorised anyone to issue such instructions. If any such instructions have been given to staff, as far as we are aware no one has acted upon them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The commission is investigating some serious allegations  &mdash;  which have been strenuously denied  &mdash;  in accordance with our internal procedures.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the summer it emerged that the work and pensions department had conducted a similar exercise to expose racist businesses. Civil servants fabricated more than 2,000 job applications and concocted false names to see whether employers turned down applicants simply because they appeared to be black or Asian.</p>
<p>They found that an applicant who appeared to be white would send nine applications before getting a positive response while minority candidates with the same qualifications had to send 16.<br>

		<p>Let me state the obvious.  We have similar anti-white hate groups in the US with ties to government that have in the past and which continue today to try to entrap whites and white groups.  My guess is that most people who visit this site can name the two major anti-white hate groups in the US.</p>

		<p>Of course this was a crazy and borderline (if not actually) illegal thing to do, but that&rsquo;s only from our perspective.</p>
<p>A physics teacher I had, during our astronomy unit, described a black hole as a infinitesimally small and infinitely dense point of finite mass that exerts so much gravity on its surrounding space that the very notion of &#8220;straight&#8221; defies intuition, and if you fired a beam of light toward it, it would be seen to circle around the point of singularity.  The beam would be travelling &#8220;straight&#8221; in its own sense, but only in space so warped that, from within the warped space, the spaceship above would appear bent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the way it is with the political and social doctrine of equality, racial and otherwise.  Those who believe in it/religiously adhere to it are so warped because of their belief/faith that everybody else looks crazy, and their actions in pursuit of equality, while completely normal to them, look crooked to everyone else.  Their logic and reason, such as it is, is completely sane to them, and our way of thinking is warped according to them, but according to us, they&rsquo;re the ones that are warped and we&rsquo;re normal.</p>

		<p>The story about the labor party admitting they deliberately flooded the UK with millions of immigrants to quoye&rsquo;rub their noses in it.&#8221; is the most explosive story I have read in years, yet there is not a word in the USA press. Here we have a government deliberately practising ethnic cleansing on its own people under the guise of the Holy Diversity and Multiculturalism gods and no one utters a peep. This story is bigger to me than Climategate. We need to never let it be forgotten or have it disappear down the memory hole.<br>
The same thing is happening in the USA but no politician has yet had tje audacity to publicly state the case so well.</p>
<p>Google &#8220;rub their noses in it immigration and read the story yourself.</p>
<p>Then pass it on.<br>

<p>Pikers.  If you want something done right, do it yourself.  They should get <i>whites</i> to join the BNP and take over positions with authority over party membership.  <i>Then</i> they should send their non-white agents provocateur to be refused membership by their white agents provocateur, and then their lawyers can sue.  A perfect plan, with none of those actual pesky <i>real</i> BNP members to get in the way.</p>

		<p>The left in Britain have made a series of own goals recently. The useless Trevor Phillips commented before that Turkey saved Britain when being attacked by the Spanish armada. Absolute rubbish! Now the feminist Harriet Harman has brought in a law which discriminates against white people. Hopefully all this will help the BNP vote in may 2010. <a href="https://northfieldpatriot.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://northfieldpatriot.blogspot.com/</a></p>

<p>   Nothing unusual here. This sort of thing has been going on for decades within the &ldquo;right wing movement&rdquo; in the United States. Even American Renaissance has its share of &#8220;agent provocateurs&#8221; and trolls regularly posting to this website. While some contrary posts are genuine and welcome, it is anyone&rsquo;s guess what entities or organizations may be routinely posting to American Renaissance. </p>

There are now around 1,162 of these, employing some 700,000 expensive, unqualified and unwanted pen-pushers, paid for out of our tax and none are accountable to the electorate. All these &#8216;race relation&rsquo; type groups are quangos and all, without exception, are headed by a non-White, non-English appointee of the nu-lab-rat. We come across them every day.. spying, snooping, watching and probing in case we &#8216;offend&rsquo; muslims, blacks, immigrants and gypsies or support legitimate political parties such as the BNP.

		<p>#5 &#8220;The story about the labor party admitting they deliberately flooded the UK with millions of immigrants &hellip;  yet there is not a word in the USA press.&#8221;</p>
<p>At about the same time Bill Clinton bragged that the &#8220;vast right-wing conspiracy&#8221; was weaker &#8220;because America has changed demographically&#8221; from just 10-15 years ago when he was in power.   He was bragging about what amounts to a successful policy of racist colonialism for political power,  one far in advance of the British one.  What was most telling about the Clinton story was the near total silence on it from conservatives, even the little conservatives on the boards.   They simply won&rsquo;t touch the issue of race, culture and politics.  The only ones who pretend that mass-immigration won&rsquo;t have a profound effect on society are conservatives and Republicans and that tells you a lot about who and what is really in power in this country.   In the word of Peter Brimelow:</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, though, the Republican paralysis has to be judged a classic case of one competitor achieving moral hegemony over another. The Republicans, it is clear, have actually come to believe the Democrats&rsquo; propaganda. They now believe that appeals to their own political base are immoral, even though the Democrats play that very game themselves. That is a formula for political destruction. And as immigration-driven demographic change transforms American politics, it will change the society as well, through the political process and in countless other ways.</p>
<p>A great demographic storm is breaking over America. The Republican Party may prove to be the least that it sweeps away.&#8221; - <i>Swept Away By  Peter Brimelow and Edwin S. Rubenstein.</i></p>
