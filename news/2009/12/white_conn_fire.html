			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, December 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of white New Haven firefighters who won a discrimination case before the U.S. Supreme Court are seeking back pay, damages and legal fees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Karen Torre, the firefighters&rsquo; attorney, filed papers last week in U.S. District Court in New Haven arguing the firefighters are entitled to back pay with interest for long-overdue promotions, several categories of damages and attorney fees.</p>
<p>The firefighters were subject to &#8220;the humiliation and economic hardship of prolonged career stagnancy in a rancorous atmosphere fostered by raw racial divides,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>City officials said the Supreme Court ruling is limited to relief for 14 plaintiffs who would have been promoted if the 2003 tests had been certified.</p>
<p>Other firefighters who sued and were not promoted reserve their right to challenge the city&rsquo;s position that they were not entitled to promotions but are to damages, Torre said.</p>
<p>Bernard Jacques, an employment attorney in Hartford, said the claims could wind up costing New Haven $1 million or more. Cities typically have insurance to cover such losses, he said.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Bernard Jacques, an employment attorney in Hartford, said the claims could wind up costing New Haven $1 million or more. Cities typically have insurance to cover such losses, he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the white administrators will claim they have to discriminate against whites or get sued by non-whites, which, of course, is in no way the reason they fold so easily to non-white pressure.</p>
<p>They fold, because they know whites won&rsquo;t fight back, and they can screw them out of money and jobs via political correctness.</p>
<p>Well, they lost this one.  But it&rsquo;s going to take a lot more wins to change the attitudes of these cowardly demagogues.</p>

		<p>Is it possible for this case to go all the way up to the Supreme court?</p>
<p>Imagine Sonia Sotomayor being faced with this case, once again&hellip;</p>

		<p>Good for these men to stand up and fight for what they have earned. I&rsquo;m rooting for them all the way.</p>

		<p>I hope their insurance refuses to cover them because they intentionally engaged in a criminal act.  That&rsquo;ll wake em up.</p>

		<p>So, it&rsquo;s going to cost the City of New Haven one million dollars, in back pay, and damages. Too bad. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a lesson for New Haven, and the rest of the Liberal hotbeds, we call Cities. Screw around with Whites, and we will sue you, and win, with precendents on our side.</p>
<p>Poke the Lion, and you&rsquo;re going to get mauled. </p>

		<p>Generally, if a judge has been promoted to a higher court they will recuse themselves if a case they decided comes before them through an appeal. There is no telling what the wise Latina will do, however. </p>

		<p>There is nothing more perfect to me than seeing, or being a part of White Pride&hellip;White Solidarity&hellip;White Union&hellip;.</p>
<p>All of the &#8216;education&rsquo; [indoctrination] cannot do anything when it meets &#8216;reality&rsquo; of the real world around them versus the perceived fanatasy land they hope to accomplish through subjugation and conformity to another&hellip;.</p>
<p>THESE Firefighters have been Awakened and now are Aware&hellip;.aware of the governmental policies against them&hellip;all because they were born of the Superior Race&hellip;.with Superior Genes&hellip;..</p>
<p>They are sticking together in the court rooms&hellip;..</p>
<p>WE need to stick together on the streets!!&hellip;..</p>
<p><br>
By the way, fellow AmRen&rsquo;rs&hellip;&hellip;.MERRY CHRISTMAS!!&hellip;.</p>

		<p>@ UnTel (6):</p>
<p>Thanks, UnTel. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid the Wise Latina (she&rsquo;ll be stuck for a while with that nickname, I guess) might not recuse herself. After all, she has worked so very hard, and she is such a great success story, etc, she,s not going to miss an opportunity to damage those Whites&rsquo; lives, again&hellip;</p>
<p>Plus, she has made it pretty clear that she does believe in judges making law from the bench, and that a wise Latina like her knows what is best for America; so she may think she has to correct the mistake made by the other judges.</p>

		<p>Even Michael Steele chose her over a &#8216;white male&rsquo; just so he could add more &#8216;diversity.&rsquo;  THis is why I don&rsquo;t even trust black conservatives.  They will kiss up to whites, and once you give them power they stab us in the back.  I hate Michael Steele.  He&rsquo;s an insult to real conservative whites and I will not vote for the Republican Party unless they become aggressively pro-white and stop pandering to hispanics and blacks.</p>
