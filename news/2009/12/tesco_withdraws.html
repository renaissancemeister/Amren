Even Ginger Ones&rsquo; After Woman Complains</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Murray, Herald Sun (Southbank, Melbourne), December 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A LEADING UK supermarket chain has withdrawn a Christmas card that poked fun at &#8220;gingers&#8221; after claims of discrimination.</p>
<p>Davinia Phillips, a mum of three flame-haired children, saw red when she came across a card which stated: &#8220;Santa loves all kids. Even ginger ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lodged a complaint with the store and went public to defend redheads everywhere against &#8220;gingerism&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kept thinking is it me because I&rsquo;ve got ginger kids and I&rsquo;m a bit over-reactive mother?&#8221; she told BBC television.</p>
<p>&#8220;But everybody I&rsquo;ve spoken to said if that had of been about an obese child, or a child with glasses, or a child with braces, or a coloured child, then there would be a massive uproar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Phillips, 30, from York, added that a few weeks ago her children returned from school upset because they had been called &#8220;ginger ninjas&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just said there was nothing wrong with being a ginger, or a ninja for that matter,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never seen anything in my life prompting making fun out of people with ginger hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&rsquo;m just being naive but they shouldn&rsquo;t be able to make fun of ginger children like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>While critics dubbed her a &#8220;ginger whinger&#8221;, supermarket chain Tesco released an apologetic statement saying the card had been withdrawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sell a large range of Christmas cards including some which are intended to be humorous,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is never our intention to offend any customer and we are sorry if this card caused any upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redheads are often the target of comedians, with Australia&rsquo;s Chris Lilley once launching a &#8216;Sorry Ranga Day&rsquo; for a tongue-in-cheek reconciliation with the ginger generation.</p>

		<p>The hour is too late for any intranicene squabbles among whites.  I am rather fond of the diversity of hair colors among whites, and anything that appreciates that is fine by me.  Anything which shames those who would bash these differences is also fine by me.</p>
<p>Pauline Hanson has red hair, BTW.</p>

		<p>Ginger is a term probably not created by South Park, but has been recently popularized by the show.  It&rsquo;s probably not something that you would want sell in your store, unless you are running a more &#8220;edgy&#8221; gift store (we have many of those in where I live).</p>
<p>That being said, if the card had used a derogatory term about a non-white group of people, heads would be rolling.  Either we make fun of everyone or no one.  Society needs to decide. Double standard once again.</p>

		<p>What is it about the non-US English-speaking world that has this need to make fun of &#8220;ginger&#8221; hair?  Is it some England vs. Ireland thing?  I have never noticed anyone in the US have this focus.  If they did, however, I know it wouldn&rsquo;t count as a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;.  Skin color is what matters for that:  non-whites only.</p>

		<p>First there was a rash of jokes meant to demean and degrade blonds. And now the ginger bashing. Has this been accompanied by an overall increase of abuse aimed at whites in general? I think so.</p>

		<p>That Christmas card is not okay.  Not at all.  England is being overrun with non-white immigrants and their hostile first-generation children who have no respect for their hosts who saved them from the hells their parents left.  The British solution is to ridicule white children with recessive genes?  How cowardly!!</p>
<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t come as any surprise to me though.  I started college as a mathematics major because I wasn&rsquo;t old enough for the nursing program, which had a minimum age of 17.  I held my own in math class, even when I was often the only female student.  I had to put up with my classmates wondering aloud who the &#8220;dumb blond&#8221; had had sex with to be admitted to the department and a professor telling me in front of my classmates that my boyfriend must have done my homework for me after I had worked all night to solve an equation that my classmates had not.  Imagine if I had been treated like that as a black student.  I bet you can&rsquo;t even imagine it because it is unthinkable.</p>
<p>What is it about white people under siege by non-white people that makes so many of us just look for a white minority, preferably those with recessive genes like red or blond hair or blue eyes for &#8220;humor&#8221; or for cruel use in liberal propaganda?</p>

		<p>I personally think that it was a lame attempt at humor. White bashing is a big issue and if it were aimed at &#8220;nappy headed kids&#8221; this would be all over CNN ect. I think red heads get made fun of so often that outside the British Isles they are relatively rare. Any trait that is rare is either revered or feared and either can be fodder for jokes and teasing. </p>

		<p>This is surprising.  Harry Potter&rsquo;s best friend Ron and his numerous siblings are all &#8220;gingers.&#8221;  This seems to have created a bit of a &#8220;ginger chic&#8221; in the U.S.  I guess not so much in the U.K.</p>

		<p>What is wrong with England? Look at this kid in the photo, with Santa. Any White American parent would be proud to have him as their son. </p>
<p>These people aren&rsquo;t right in the head. They bend over backwards for all types of non-Whites, who are ugly as sin, yet the ridicule good looking kids like this. </p>
<p>Maybe someone should tell these geniuses that red hair came from Norway. Many Vikings were redheaded. Eric the Red is the most famous of Red haired Vikings. And Vikings were some of the most feared Warriors on Earth.</p>

		<p>Ginny: You should seriously considering complaining the dean about the professor&rsquo;s demeaning comment. While I doubt they&rsquo;d do anything about the abuse from other students   &mdash;   you could always try though   &mdash;    I do believe this would accomplish something. You shouldn&rsquo;t stand for that sort of treatment.</p>

		<p>Sometimes I think that Whites are displacing their bad feelings toward Blacks by turning on other Whites. I think it is an innate psychological mechanism. </p>
<p>By displacing I mean that the antagonistic feeling toward Blacks and, say, Pakis, is there and it is &#8220;grounded&#8221; or defused by directing it toward Whites. Much safer that way.</p>
<p>I have noticed this for about thrity years, beginning when the White students at my college would, at basketball games, shout at the opposing White players, callilng them &#8220;rednecks&#8221;.</p>
<p>I never heard Black students shout at the opposing Black players.</p>
<p>I have also seen White college students defer to Black waiters at restaurants, even calling them &#8220;sir&#8221;. But then they will curse like sailors in the presence of elderly White women, who are still offended at such behavior.</p>

		<p>Call me paranoid, but I think this must be nipped in the bud. I believe it&rsquo;s a reaction to the &#8220;others&#8221; among us, who are destroying our societies but must not be criticised or even mentioned.  People are looking for someone they can strike back at, and when our enemies say &#8220;here, blondes/redheads are fair game&#8221;, they are trying to get us to eat our own in order to sublimate our natural impulse to defend ourselves. Also, it encourages the non-whites to pile on.</p>
<p>I understand this particular pathology was started by a theme in South Park. I wouldn&rsquo;t know, never bothered to watch that show. It struck me from the first as a deliberate assault on all standards, technical and societal. Self-consciously anti-excellence.</p>
<p>Yeah, that must be it.  Paranoid.</p>

		<p> Until quite recently, I&rsquo;ve never heard of hostility toward red heads or &#8220;Gingers&rdquo;. Is this something strange out of contemporary Great Britain, Ireland or Australia? Why do whites feel such self hatred? I personally find red headed women very attractive. I can&rsquo;t for the life of me figure out where this utter nonsense came from.</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;ginger&#8221; to describe a red-haired person has long existed in England. When I was a child (in the early 60s) we had coal delivered to our house by a man whose nickname was Ginger (on account of his red hair).</p>
<p>Quite unrelated is the Cockney rhyming slang term &#8220;ginger&#8221;, which means &#8220;homosexual&#8221; (ginger beer = queer)!</p>

		<p>Englishman here- &#8220;gingerism&#8221; is a fairly benign cultural meme in this country- while there are no doubt times it&rsquo;s taken too far in the playground, it&rsquo;s mostly an Anglo-Saxon/Celt friendly rivalry thing.</p>

		<p>       It rolls down hill-since White is bad, really White is really bad. So do to those Whiter than you what the Non Whites are doing to you. Beyond that, there may have been some old prejudices there to being with. In some parts of Ireland, red hair was considered unlucky for example.</p>

		<p>Tom might be right about it being an Anglo-Saxon/Celtic rivalry thing.</p>
<p>Deep red hair is associated with Celts (especially the Irish). There is, however, a lighter, sandier shade of red hair that is more characteristic of the English (especially those of Norse descent).</p>

		<p>Imagine if a Christmas card stated that Santa loves all children even&hellip; fill in the blanks here, black ones, mexican ones, muslim ones etc. All hell would break loose. There would be protests from coast to coast. No business would dare do that. I say if they can&rsquo;t say that about any non-White group, than they shouldn&rsquo;t be able to say that about any Whites. It should be all or nothing. Also note that when a White complains, they&rsquo;re &#8220;whining&#8221; or &#8220;thin skinned&#8221; such as what was said about the mom complaining about the cards, but any non-White who yells racism about nothing will be taken deadly seriously and everyone will bend over backwards to appease.</p>

<p>Oops, sorry, I forgot that the West has sold its birthright for a cup of porridge and the all important &#8220;non-racist&#8221; label, even if it means Western children are ridiculed or in danger for being white.  What a deal!</p>

		<p>This whole sorry saga tells you everything you need to know about the self-loathing that overtakes a society that has been thouroughly de-culturalised.There is no Saxon/Celtic rivalry involved here,just a pathetic stab at irony by an imbecile force-fed on a diet of multiculturalism.This kind of excuse for humour is not without precedent however nor is solely the preserve of the English,as sometime in the early days of Hollywood some bright spark decided to equate blondness with stupidity,a ploy so successful that even the Scandinavians have bought into it!!</p>
