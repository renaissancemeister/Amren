<h1>Culturally Competent Guide to Holidays in the Workplace</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lizz Carroll, Diversity, Inc., December 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Party Etiquette</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always nice when your company throws an office-wide get-together before the holidays, but what should they call it so that it&rsquo;s inclusive to all invited?</p>
<p>&#8220;A &#8216;holiday party&rsquo; is an acceptable name for a seasonal event  &mdash;  it could reference Martin Luther King Day or Christmas or any other federal holiday a company recognizes,&#8221; says Nancy Di Dia, Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s executive director of diversity, inclusion and engagement.</p>
<p>While this may work in some offices, Joyce S. Dubensky, executive vice president and CEO of the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding, advises a more conservative approach. &#8220;Many organizations opt for &#8216;holiday party,&rsquo; which sounds neutral but can still create problems,&#8221; she says. &#8220;There are religions, like Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, that don&rsquo;t celebrate any of the winter holidays. In fact, their faith bars them from observing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the solution? &#8220;An alternative would be to create a name that&rsquo;s not specifically holiday-focused, like &#8216;2009 Company X Celebration.&rsquo; Because the celebration is not based on the holidays, those who don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t celebrate any winter holidays are still included,&#8221; says Dubensky.</p>
<p><b>Deck the Halls</b></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been put in charge of decorating for the big event, so how do you create an environment that makes everyone feel comfortable?</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep decorating as seasonal as possible  &mdash;  use terms like &#8216;Season&rsquo;s Greetings,&rsquo; &#8216;Looking Forward&rsquo; and &#8216;Best Wishes in the New Year.&rsquo; If it stays focused on the new year, it also ties to business goals and the promise of having the opportunity to achieve or exceed goals in a new year,&#8221; says Di Dia.</p>
<p>For Dubensky, teamwork and variety are key. She says, &#8220;One tactic we recommend is to put together a multi-faith team of employees to help you plan and coordinate the event. That way, you get diversity of views about the kind of party to throw.&#8221;</p>
<p>She adds, &#8220;Different companies also have different cultures. A multi-faith, seasonal display of Christmas tree, menorah and a Kinara (the holder for Kwanzaa candles) mixed with generic winter-themed decorations may be completely acceptable for one company, while another may opt strictly for seasonal decorations (e.g., snowflakes, flower arrangements with seasonal flowers and berries), a themed party with related decorations (like a &rsquo;50s party) or even no decorations at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Gift-Giving</b></p>
<p>You love giving gifts to others during this season, even if it&rsquo;s just a gesture, but how do you give presents to those who don&rsquo;t share the same faith as you? Dubensky advises to give &#8220;joyfully and with a spirit of goodwill,&#8221; but make sure you remain respectful. &#8220;Of course, any gifts should not involve religious elements that may be experienced as coercive or proselytizing  &mdash;  because that could turn the gift into an unwelcome happening. It is best to avoid gifts with explicit references to your religious beliefs,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p><b>Greetings</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She [Dubensky] adds, &#8220;If you do choose to offer personalized holiday greetings, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa and Blessed Eid (if it falls in December) are the appropriate greetings. Many card stores now offer these options during the holiday season.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never known of a company that throws an MLK Day party.  If they tried, the NAACP would scream racism, b/c of course, the day is the most reverent and holy on the calendar, and has to be observed that way.</p>
<p>My advice in this stead is not to attend C********s/Holiday Parties if your company has one.  You can&rsquo;t offend someone if you&rsquo;re not there.  Also, if you have the authority within a company, don&rsquo;t hold these parties.  I&rsquo;ve always made it my business to construct the world&rsquo;s most impenetrable wall between my work life and my personal life.  I view my coworkers and supervisors as superficially human, but institutional automatons in reality.  I don&rsquo;t make friends at work, because I don&rsquo;t make enemies at work, and vice versa.  And I certainly don&rsquo;t do religious or political proselytization, nor organize fantasy football leagues or tourney bracket pools.  I can&rsquo;t imagine how much productivity is lost because of office politics and gossip.  I&rsquo;m there to do a job, nothing more.  I would think that way even if my workplace were all white.</p>

<p>So decrees the Diversity Commissar of &ldquo;Interreligious Understanding&rdquo; and Total Holiday Destruction, Comrade Joyce S. Dubensky. </p>
<p>My response to her and all her windy Red rubbish is, take it and stick it right up your &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; Eid!</p>
<p>And if it became the universal practice to throw a &ldquo;50s party&rdquo; at this time of year Comrade Dubensky, how long before the more &ldquo;lucid&rdquo; of the wretched Marxist lunatics like yourself, were demanding that all parties be &ldquo;themed&rdquo; for only 1967 and beyond? With the fecklessly warped reasoning, that only after that date and the torching of Detroit, did we enter the psychedelically Multicultural Epoch? After all, were not the 1950s tainted with &ldquo;racism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only good thing that I can say about freaks like this diversity drooling Comrade Joyce S. Dubensky, is that they do our cause far more good (in the long run) with the slumbering white masses, then they possibly can ever realize. If they only knew the bewildered contempt that most of those white sheep start braying when they see something like this, they would knock it off posthaste. The only worse thing they could probably do, would be to outlaw drinking beer when a football game is on the boob tube. </p>
<p>That might actually get them to revolt!</p>
<p>With that said, Merry Christmas to all you good and awakened people here at AR,</p>
<p>John PM!!!</p>

<p>Lately I hear &#8216;Happy Holidays&rsquo; over and over all day. I do not respond. If someone tells me &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; I respond in kind. To be honest I do not care if the other creeds are happy or not. </p>

		<p>I know the whole secular approach is how America is run, but how pathetically sensitive are you if you actually get offended as a non-Christian and you are told &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221;? &#8220;Multi-faith teams of employees&#8221;? Really?<br>
 <br>
If the person who runs the place is Christian, it&rsquo;s gonna be a Christmas party. If he&rsquo;s Jewish, Hanukkah. These commie liberals seem to think that any sign of a specific holiday is an attempt at shoving that holiday down the minority&rsquo;s throats. It&rsquo;s not. They&rsquo;re still free to celebrate whatever the hell they want in there own homes, but if the head honcho wants a Christmas party, he has every right to have one without the interjection of some pro-diversity leftard company.</p>
<p>Besides, if you&rsquo;re so touchy that you are irked if told &#8220;Happy Hanukkah&#8221; by your Jewish co-worker, then you probably aren&rsquo;t fit for the workplace, or any other potentially social environment for that matter, to begin with.</p>

		<p>This is one for the books.  I wonder if Dubensky realizes that even the name &#8220;2009 Company X Celebration&#8221; could be found objectionable by those from whom this is NOT 2009 AD, that is to say &#8220;Anno Domini&#8221; as in &#8220;the year of our Lord&#8221; and not any of that CE politically correct nonsense. If you think I&rsquo;m being bitingly sarcastic, you&rsquo;re right.</p>

		<p>This article&rsquo;s suggestion to have a &#8220;multi-faith team to coordinate the event&#8221; made me laugh.</p>
<p>In a small company I worked for,there was one Jewish co-worker who constantly complained about the inter-faith company committee that had been set up. His exact words to me were &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care what this company does in December. I don&rsquo;t come to work to get my faith validated. But they pretty much make me be on that (expletive deleted) committee every year!&#8221; All year, he worked and got along with everyone. However, in December, he felt singled out and began to think he was a token. I heard the year after I left, he flatly refused to be on the committee. </p>

		<p>Geez, who would want to attend a party where you&rsquo;d have to walk on eggshells in stark fear of &#8216;offending&rsquo; anyone and perhaps put your job and reputation in jeopardy. We&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where even innocuous statements said in complete innocence could cost you your job and more.</p>
<p>The old Soviet Bosses would be proud.</p>
<p>It reminds me of that episode of the old Twilight Zone where Billy Mumy plays an omnipotent young child, able to instantly eliminate those whom he does not like  &mdash;  terrorizing all of the adults around him and forcing them to pretend everything is &#8216;great&rsquo; and &#8216;good&rsquo; lest they end up as a Jack-in-the-Box in a corn field. </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/4bkbhq" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/4bkbhq</a></p>
<p>It seems the way things are going, as the First Amendment becomes a relic, we&rsquo;ll only be able to say the following three statements without fear:</p>
<p>War is peace. </p>
<p>Freedom is slavery. </p>
<p>Ignorance is strength.</p>
<p>George Orwell also said this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Is it too late to stop this?  And if not, what will it take for a return to a world of sanity?  I posit it will take a complete balkanization of the US along racial lines to end this reign of terror against Whites.</p>

		<p>Where I work, the office people wanted to start a &#8220;Secret Santa&#8221; thing where everyone picks a name out of hat and has to give that person a present at the upcoming holiday party.  An Iranian lady who works here replied in her e-mail that santa is not part of her culture and can the name be changed to something else, like secret snowflake.  </p>
<p>Now she is completely irreligious.  She does not follow any aspect of her parents&rsquo; religion.  She is cohabiting with a member of the staff, drinks alcohol, tries hard to adopt latino cultural rhythms, eats pork, dresses inappropriately, etc&hellip;  Given that the whole Santa thing is pretty secular, I was surprised she would suddenly get indignant.  </p>

It is true the Jehovahs contingent is affronted by Holiday celebrating. I like how in the article MLK Day is put on the same plain as Christmas. </p>

		<p>As a Christian, I do find the term &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; to be highly offensive.  Why?  Because Christmas, or Christ-Mass, means &#8220;death of Christ.&#8221;  And what is so merry about that?</p>
<p>The Puritans outlawed Christmas as witchcraft.  Maybe they were onto something&hellip;?  Christmas, after all, has its roots in paganism.  It never had anything to do with Christ.</p>
<p>I know people think I&rsquo;m mean for &#8220;denying&#8221; my child Christmas, but you know what?  He had a really great time last week opening presents for his birthday!</p>

		<p>I agree with those who say that work is or doing a job, not having parties no matter what you might call them. Along with every other situation, if a workplace is majority Christian then call it a Christmas party by all means, even athiets sometimes celebrate Christmas. If you do happen to live in a more pluralistic area then call it a &#8220;year end celebration&#8221;. The best idea yet would be to give everyone the choice to either have Christmas eve and Day off or New Years Eve and Day off and not have any sort of a party. </p>

		<p>EW-&#8220;Yes. No decorations at all, that would be the best option. Or, better yet, no party at all&#8221;</p>
<p>And if employees want to, they can have their own get-together.  The company doesn&rsquo;t have to fund one.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s only one sure way to not &#8220;offend&#8221; anyone, and that&rsquo;s to just go and be with your own people and cultures. But of course, that would be against the &#8220;melting pot of diversity&#8221; ideology.</p>
<p>On another note, Merry Christmas and Happy (and politically incorrect) New Year.</p>

		<p>The Marxists want us to dilute our European Christian culture under the pretense that we need to be more welcoming to the new immigrants.  The end result (the Marxists hope) is an America that has forgotten its historical European Christian roots, where all Euro Americans do is work, pay taxes, shop, and hand their children over to be indoctrinated in public schools.  </p>
<p>The Elite want White Americans to forget we are a special people with a unique heritage and for us to blend ourselves away into the Brown and Black cultures and gene pools.  As the White wimps deny our Christian holidays so as not to offend, we are creating a vacuum to be filled by Third World holidays or Big Brother holidays.    </p>
<p>It is impossible to appease government agencies and non-White tribes who want to dominate us and take over.  The more we give away, the more they want from us as they smell weakness.</p>

		<p>Nick: &#8220;Go to the greeting card section of your store. Hanukkah and Kwanzaa are treated with great solemnity while at the same time humorous Christmas cards or Christmas cards in poor taste are in abundance.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you know what?  Those stores are in business to make a profit. If enough folks are offended and do not buy those cards, the store will either stock something in line with the tastes of their customer base, or they will end up closing the doors.</p>
<p>And now, for something different: to each of you readers at AmRen who are Christians, I wish you all a festive and merry Christmas.  And for ALL the AmReners, I offer my wishes to you for a better and prosperous new year.</p>

		<p>I love my job, and I like many of the people I work with, and I respect many others. I have drinks after work every so often with the staff who report to me. Still, I have no stomach for this once a year thank you from the company. I don&rsquo;t associate with most of the people I work with after hours, and have never had them in my home.<br>
I am by no means antisocial. I just don&rsquo;t enjoy spending the whole day drinking, eating, dancing and talking with people who are not close, personal friends. Call me a Grinch, but I&rsquo;d rather they gave me a check than spend the same amount on dull office parties.</p>

		<p>Bottom line:  No matter WHAT you do, you will never, ever, avoid offending someone. </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t possibly please everyone. No sense tormenting yourself about it!</p>

Alexandra, you maam are clueless let me help you out. 1. Not all masses are a celebration of death. 2. Christmas is a mass that celebrates the birth of Christ,the Son of God, our intercessor who would later make a sacrifice that would bridge the gap between us and God the father. 3. If there is anything on Earth that is worth celebrating it is the death of our Lord Jesus the act that granted absolution and salvation for us all. 4. The Puritans were some of the most repressed  specimans that humanity has ever produced. 5. The early Christians having an understanding of the Human condition replaced the pagan holiday of yule with a holdiday focused on Christ to address the human needs of pagan converts. 6. Jesus like a nice party now and again the Bible even says so. Merry Christ-Mass</p>
