<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20091210/US.Firefighters.Lawsuit/">Promotion Day Arrives for White Conn. Firefighters</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Christoffersen, Comcast News, December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of white firefighters who persuaded the U.S. Supreme Court to sanction their promotions over black colleagues are receiving their new badges Thursday in a ceremony that provides symbolic recognition of their victory.</p>
<p>The high court ruled in June that New Haven officials violated white firefighters&rsquo; civil rights when they threw out 2003 test results in which too few minorities did well.</p>
<p>The case became an issue in confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who ruled against the white firefighters when she served on a federal appeals court.</p>
<p>Fourteen firefighters who sued are being promoted Thursday to lieutenant and captain. Another 10 firefighters, including four minorities, who took the 2003 tests but were not plaintiffs in the court case also will be promoted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Thompson [Dennis Thompson, an attorney for black firefighters who tried unsuccessfully last month to block the promotions of the plaintiffs], who is trying to intervene in federal court in New Haven to challenge the validity of the exams now that they have been certified, said the fight is not over because the black firefighters were not heard. In other cases cities have been required to make more promotions than planned, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That prompted an angry reaction from Karen Torre, attorney for the white firefighters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Attorney Thompson&rsquo;s provocations and promise, to me, only demonstrates the need for the Supreme Court to take up the issue of the constitutionality of that provision of Title VII that allows such people to paralyze local governments and the civil service and hold the public hostage to endless litigation over the issue of race,&#8221; Torre said in a statement.</p>
<p>David Rosen, an attorney for a black New Haven firefighter who is suing the city and arguing he was unfairly denied a promotion, said Wednesday that his client, Michael Briscoe, is happy for the firefighters being promoted and has congratulated several of them.</p>

		<p>Now comes the hard part   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m sure all of these new lieutenant and captains have black subordinates, and I bet a lot of those will drag their feet or disobey their bosses&rsquo; orders.  The Supreme Court should have put the New Haven Fire Department under a consent decree, in order to monitor and punish such shenanigans.</p>
<p>BTW, one of those &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; questions on a St. Louis Fire Department *promotion* (not entrance) tests was:   You are 90 feet away from the fire.  Your hoses are all 30 feet long.  How many hoses must you tie together to get right up to the fire?</p>
<p>After all, 90 divided by 30 is racist oppression, fight the power.  Even at that, firefighters on the entry level don&rsquo;t need to know this.</p>

		<p>Just one small victory for whites, but be ye not deceived Sonia Sotomayor is back on the job to assure that whitey stays in the back of the bus.</p>
<p>Today Rush Limbaugh came closest to saying we were headed for civil upheaval because a huge number of the populace has had it with this administration and the way this country has been going.</p>
<p>Because he has been saying as much as he can about race without being ousted from the air, I have gained a new respect for him, as well as Glenn Beck who outright said that Obama was a racist (And had a reputable psychiatrist agree with him).</p>
<p>When things get worse and the racial situation is more open from the black community, this administration and the media, look for both Rush and Glenn to say things that will begin to unite the white masses.</p>
<p>I know that sounds far-fetched now, but just wait awhile and see for yourself.  You won&rsquo;t have to wait long.  Things are moving pretty quickly right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it numerous times, but I&rsquo;ll say it again:  Look for the messiah to crack badly when he loses a major point or battle or fails significantly in something and watch the unfolding revelation of a racist come to the forefront.</p>

		<p>Ricci v. DeStefano settled nothing. It was another temporary fix to delay making a ruling on disparate impact.</p>
<p>If one can claim disparate impact, my question is, can one claim disparate input?</p>
<p>I believe that blacks are in collusion to deliberately not even try to pass these tests. So long as the majority does poorly, they can claim bias. I&rsquo;m sure one or two blacks could pass these tests if they wanted to. However, I believe they&rsquo;re deliberately working to suppress their own group scores to bypass these tests.</p>
<p>Until you can disprove disparate input, you can&rsquo;t prove disparate impact.<br>

<p>What&rsquo;s the story here? That too few minorities did well, or that too few Blacks did? Where are all the Asian, Indian, Arab, and Native American plaintiffs? Was the lousy &#8220;minority&#8221; presence the result of too few Black testees, or simply too few who could actually pass the test? How long will this PC charade continue?</p>

		<p>Speaking of Senorita Sotomayor, the talented writer (and Amren reader) Prof. Paul Gottfried recently bragged that his liberal son works as her ventriloquist.<br>
https://tinyurl.com/ycbpbhl</p>
<p>In the Third World America of the future there&rsquo;ll probably be a giant monument erected in her honor. It will be long forgotten that like M.L. King, Alex Haley and Obama she needed a white ghostwriter to make her sound intelligent.</p>

		<p>Has Africa ever designed or built a fire department? How about a fire truck? A hook and latter? A fire plug? Pipes or pumps? Hoses? Plumbing? A fire extinguisher? A pipe wrench? The safety attire that firemen wear? A safety match? How many people in Africa have ever considered the chemical science behind an ordinary combustible fire, an electrical fire, or a flammable liquid fire?<br>
 <br>
The point, my friends, is that the concepts of firefighting, plumbing, motorized transportation, computer science, chemical engineering, fire safety, and fire retardant clothing are ideas that came from people with high intelligence and the capacity to imagine, study, and invent such novelties to advance our society. Can anyone name one invention, idea, or concept that originated in Africa? If so, please enlighten me.</p>
<p>Egalitarians can pretend that Africans understand the basic concepts of firefighting, but pretending does not make something true. Nor can pretending allow lower-intelligent firefighters to perform better on promotion tests than those with superior intelligence. </p>
<p>With the predictable academic performance failure, the only recourse is for them, and their Liberal caretakers, to engage in their habitual cries of racism, discrimination, and disparate impact.</p>
<p>The reality is that most Blacks would be far better off and happier in Africa, far removed from the demands of civilization.</p>
<p>God knows that I would feel safer knowing that we have competent firefighters who EARNED their positions, rather than affirmative-action cases who advanced because of the color of their skin.<br>

<p>As long as disparate impact is the law of our land we are in trouble. This doctrine is the foundation of quotas. I have posted before how I recall Lyndon B. Johnson looking out from my black and white television and intoning that we &#8220;Must not only have equality of opportunity, we must also have equality of results.&#8221;.  <br>
We are living in the wake of that statement. I will read with interest Justice Sotomeyer&rsquo;s legal gymnastics as she strives to justify the  upcoming racially based decisions she was appointed to write. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it will take to unify the white population of this country to demand an end to affirmative action and these other racist set-asides that discriminate against them.  Having worked for the local government I can personally tesify how difficult it was to obtain a promotion.  Hispanics hired by the City of Chicago earn an additional 5% above their pay grade simply because they have an Hispanic sounding surname.  Actually it was put into their union contract by the American Federation of State and Municipal Employees union(AFSCME)but it didn&rsquo;t cover white employees who could speak Spanish fluently or if they could speak or write any other language.  Their rationale was that Chicago has a huge population of Hispanics and a City employee might have to come in contact with them, and therefore it would be appropraite to speak Spanish.  The problem is that not every employee comes in direct contact with someone seeking city services.  There is no language tests given, so if you have a Spanish surname you are assumed to be able to speak and write Spanish.  Evidently the chump taxpayers don&rsquo;t mind.  That extra 5% can really add up when retirement time comes around.  If truth be told, other than the police and fire departments, you would have a difficult time finding white employees(especially white males)employed in other City of Chicago departments.  What can wake them up, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

		<p>EVERY RACE has it&rsquo;s own idiosyncrasies including my own white race BUT it seems that we need to admit blacks always seem to come in on the bottom of the heap where the ability to read, write and think come into play. Why don&rsquo;t they just stick to singing and dancing along with the ball sports they seem so qualified for? Heck I wish I could sing and dance and make a millon doing it!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what incenses me about many black professional athletes.  They&rsquo;ll make more money in a year, some of them, than you and I combined will see in our lifetimes.  So with the world laid out at their feet, they still can&rsquo;t seem to be able to behave at a minimum standard, even counting the multiplicity of second chances they&rsquo;re given, and can find nothing better to do than to waste their money on weed, bling and hoes.  Then again, the old saying goes that money makes you the person you really are, so the black &#8220;afawete&#8221; that so wastes his money is really showing himself for what he really is and was all along.</p>
<p>Imagine what you and I or Jared Taylor could do for this country and our people for $10 million a year.</p>

		<p>What sort of government or institution insists that you operate on less than the best?   An inferior government and one doomed for continued failure.</p>
<p>Would you ever try to have less than the best on your team?  Only those intent on destruction and dumbing down, only those intent on changing from winners to losers.</p>
<p>Why continue this charage?  Look at statistics of minority run companies, government entities, cities, states, countries, &#8220;is that what we have aspire to become?&#8221;</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity:</p>
<p>Good point about the shameful behavior about some black multimillionaire athletes. Remember when Lyndon Johnson told us that black were the way they were because of poverty? That they were committing crimes because of poverty? All that was needed was to throw money at the problem, and it would all go away.</p>
<p>As Gomer Pyle would say, &#8220;Surprise, surprise, surprise&#8221;!</p>
<p>Some multimillionaire Bantu athletes are no better than the impoverished ghetto thug, after all. Money has nothing to do with it.</p>

		<p>the citizens of new haven should be happy that some competent firefighters are moving up to positions of authority. I say, Thank God, those blacks were kept at their level of competence. Hopefully those dull-minded black firefighters mat some day understand why they can never be promoted.</p>
