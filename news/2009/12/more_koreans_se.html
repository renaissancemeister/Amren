<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More Koreans opted for foreign spouses when marrying for the second time, the national statistical office said yesterday.</p>
<p>According to Statistics Korea, the number of Korean men who married foreign women stood at 28,163 last year, more than quadruple the number nine years ago. Of them, 9,930, or 35 percent, were remarried, up from 24.6 percent back in 2000.</p>
<p>The percentage of Korean women remarrying foreign husbands also increased from 36.4 percent in 2000 to 41.5 percent last year. In 2008, a total of 8,041 Korean women married foreign men, up 72.6 percent over the cited period.</p>
<p>The statistics agency also indicated that there were some differences in the nationalities of foreign husbands and wives.</p>
<p>Nearly 60 percent of Korean men married Chinese women for the second time, followed by those marrying women from Vietnam and the Philippines. Meanwhile, Korean women chose men from Japan (40.9 percent), China (38 percent) and the United States (8.5 percent) for their second marriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Korean men preferred women from China or other Southeast Asian countries after their failed first marriage, while Korean women chose men from developed countries such as Japan and the United States,&#8221; said an official at the agency.</p>
<p>According to the Korea Immigration Service, there were a total of 126,000 married immigrants without Korean citizenship as of June.</p>
<p>As more Korean men who engage in farming or work at factories seek their wives abroad, the number of foreign wives was 110,000, more than seven times that of foreign husbands.</p>
<p>In a survey issued in August, Chinese nationals made up the largest portion (54 percent) of the married immigrants here. Of them, 34,000 were of Korean descent.</p>
<p>The second most was Vietnamese with 29,000, followed by Filipinos with 6,200, Japanese with 4,900, Cambodians with 2,800, Mongolians with 2,300 and Americans with 1,500.<br>

		<p>Interesting about the number of Filipinas married to Korean men. When I visited the Phils. in 2007, Koreans were on the bottom rung of foreigners in the eyes of many people I talked to. In the hierarchy or foreigners, English speaking Whites are on top-U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, NZ, Whites from Western and Eastern Europe are next, followed by Japanese, Chinese, and lastly Koreans. And this is despite the disgusting behavior of various white degenerates and pedophiles that haunt S.E. Asia. My hierarchy is not scientific, but based on long conversations while travelling by ferry or staying in pension houses. Man are those ferry trips long, and I can&rsquo;t sleep in those little bunk beds in tourist class. So I would sit on deck and have a beer and watch the lights on distant islands pass by. </p>

		<p>The human brain, my dear fellows whites of upstanding character, operates in profoundly bizarre ways when one is unaware of the mechanics of the most base qualities of human nature, namely, the pursuit of status and money, wanton lust, and disobedience to ones blood lines. Intermarriage, I feel, 80% of the time, is founded upon ulterior motives that the perpetrators are not necessarily aware of. In the past, many intermarriages were brought about through rape and conquest of a vanquished foe&rsquo;s women. Today, I suppose it is not too different, though the motives are different. Women will breed for status, and men, quite frankly, slave to their animal urges, will settle down with the first woman that treats them like men and will sexually please them. It is not healthy. I will rather die unmarried than give in the human nature. And that, my friends, is the true path of the ubermensch. </p>

		<p>In other words, (at least well over a majority of the time) when choosing a mate/spouse from a foreign country, Koreans still freely choose from their own ethnic group over any others.</p>
<p>Just as with China, which this article hinted about, Japan and the United States also have a tiny percentage of Koreans living there, and I would bet the ethnic preference of Koreans searching for a foreign-born marriage partner in these countries is within the same proportion as stated for this situation towards China: &#8220;Chinese nationals made up the largest portion (54 percent) [or 68,040] of the married immigrants here. Of them, 34,000 [or 49.97%] were of Korean descent.&#8221; THAT&rsquo;S the biggest reason those countries (and others probably) are so popular for match-making with Koreans.</p>

		<p>May I say 8.5%(United States) is not high enough to be used as a valid evidence to support a particular argument?  As opposed to 41% (Japan) and 38% (China)?  If we combine Japan and China, that is roughly 80% of the entire cases.  And this author is trying to use a portion that was less than 10% of the entire cases as a support for that argument.  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Meanwhile, Korean women chose men from Japan (40.9 percent), China (38 percent) and the United States (8.5 percent) for their second marriage.&#8221;  &#8220;while Korean women chose men from developed countries such as Japan and the United States&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This author is ignoring the fact that 38% of the women married men from China and using a portion that was less thant 10% instead.  </p>
<p>What this author is saying is&hellip;.</p>
<p><b>41%</b> of Korean girls married Japanese boys<br>
<b>38%</b> of Korean girls married Chinese boys<br>
<b>8.5%</b> of Korean girls married boys from USA</p>
<p>Therefore, Korean girls tend to marry men from Japan and USA.  </p>
<p>This author needs a few more statistics lessons and to learn how to draw correct conclusions using the statistics.  </p>
<p>If we use the statistics correctly, and attempt to draw a conclusion that reflects the statistics a little more properly, We can conclude that Korean girls simply choose boys from neighboring East Asian countries China and Japan, which is roughly 80% of all cases.  Less than 10% is not sufficient enough to be used to support an argument.  </p>
<p>And lastly, &#8220;men from USA&#8221; can include men of any ethnicity who have American citizenships.  White Americans&hellip;. Korean Americans&hellip;. Chinese Americans&hellip; Japanese Americans&hellip; Black Americans&hellip;. SE Asian Americans&hellip; </p>
<p>Also, this article does not mention&hellip;  the comparison between the number of girls who marry within their race to the number of girls who marry foreign men.  </p>
<p>me&hellip;. I love both East Asian girls and white girls.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, AmRen</p>

		<p>Having lived in S.Korea and Southeast Asia, I have several thoughts on this.<br>
 <br>
One is that democracy is undermining the Confucian traditions of patriarchy: women can be more independent now and not have to put up with a husband they don&rsquo;t like. The Korean men want a wife that will be submissive so they go to a 3rd world country like The Philippines where the women are desperate to get out (I&rsquo;ve been told that the male:female ratio in PH is 1:7 and that male homosexuality is rampant).</p>
<p>Another reason is economics. Asian women from more developed countries have a reputation for being &#8220;gold diggers&#8221; (definitely too good to live/work on a farm). And while these 3rd world brides could also be very materialistic themselves, not knowing the language would make them more dependent on their husbands.   </p>

<p>  Ray, I think you&rsquo;re on to something. I read about six months ago about Taiwanese men who were getting young brides from Vietnam. Evidently, it&rsquo;s not only American and European men who have sought poorer mail order brides.  </p>
