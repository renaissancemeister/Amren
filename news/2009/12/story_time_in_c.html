<h1>Story Time in Chinese and English Coming to San Marino Library</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hector Gonzalez, Pasadena Star-News, December 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Crowell Public Library, 1890 Huntington Drive, will launch a bilingual, Chinese and English, story time program at 11 a.m. on four consecutive Saturdays, beginning Jan. 23.</p>
<p>The library&rsquo;s Youth Services Department has teamed up with several volunteers from the community to present this unique program. Stories, songs, and finger-plays are conducted in both Mandarin Chinese and English.</p>
<p>In an effort to serve Chinese speakers, as well as educate non-Chinese about the culture and expose them to another language, these story times place an emphasis on increasing literacy in both languages.</p>

		<p>You will notice that there is no need to expose the Chinese to American culture. Saying that we are going to start spending our budget on Chinese language programs which you can enjoy, too, is transparently a ruse. This way, if taxpayers ask for an accounting of what is being spent on English speakers, they can roll the Chinese language programs into the total.</p>

		<p>Why even bother anymore with english in the San Gabriel Valley?  The chinese want everything in chinese anyway, they could care less what whites think.  These invaders are here simply for monetary gain and to get every freebee available from white taxpayer money.  I don&rsquo;t want assimilation, I want these people gone!</p>

		<p>For those readers of AmRen who aren&rsquo;t familiar with the San Marino, area of Pasadena, California, allow me to create some background. Just like its pretentious name, it is a small area of fairly well to do folks in the city of Pasadena. It is made up of a large number of liberals and things like illegal immigration are just fine for them. They use illegal aliens extensivley as gardeners, maids, and for different kinds of services. In the last twenty or so years, a lot of Orientals, mostly Chinese have bought homes there. And as everyone on this forum knows by now, &#8220;immigrants&#8221; who have come to the U.S. the last thirty or so years, aren&rsquo;t interested in assimilation and that&rsquo;s why we have &#8220;little Saigons, little New Dehli&rsquo;s, etc.etc., all over California. Some people on this forum always speculate on the break-up of the U.S. into different ethnic states. I&rsquo;m beginning to believe it will happen.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #2, Chinese should be learned by AMERICAN school children since the Chinese will become the major economic and ONLY 1st world power in the world soon. They do not care about political correctness, muslim pandering or black civil rights therefore they deserve to be number one. Chinese is also the language of around 1/4 of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>

<p>But what about a trilingual program?</p>
<p>Why not teach this in: Chinese, English, and Esperanto as well?</p>
<p>Or for that matter, why not an anticipatory quadrilingual program?</p>
<p>Might not a few Sasquatch children like having their grunts and hoots (unfortunately, so long denied as even existing as a modern language) transformed into educational parables? </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>At least there is it&rsquo;s in English too - they started having these story times at a local library in Australia in Cantonese *only*. That is, until some residents with a bit of common sense got on the case of a local councillor, kindly reminding him our national language for the moment still is English, and no kids should have to miss out. He then wrote to the library, and put a stop to it - nice to see there&rsquo;s still some common sense out there.</p>
<p>&#8220;American children can learn some Chinese. That won&rsquo;t be the end of the world. In fact it should be encouraged for kids on the university track.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fair point, as long as it&rsquo;s obviously in their interests too I don&rsquo;t have too much of a problem with it, and not not another taxpayer-funded blind promotion of multiculturalism and diversity.</p>

Best post so far!  And for the posters who say whites should learn chinese, stop with the self-defeatist talk.  Everytime I hear chinese spoken, I can&rsquo;t but help think how alien and unnatural it sounds.  Whites were not born to speak the language of an alien race period!</p>

<p>Those poor kids who learn Cantonese are learning Cantonese probably won&rsquo;t have any use for it with mainland China rising.  What a dumb idea.  Even in Hong Kong I can get by speaking Mandarin. </p>
<p>To Bobby, I&rsquo;ve been to San Marino, it&rsquo;s a very nice area.  I think you&rsquo;re bit disingenous by implying that it&rsquo;s a bad place to live.  I don&rsquo;t think anyone would call it a ghetto by any means:</p>

<p>&#8220;The median income for a household in the city was $147,267, and the median income for a family was $155,708. Males had a median income of $98,928 versus $51,853 for females.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>  My elderly mother wanted to go to the Westfield Mall in Arcadia (formerly Santa Anita Fashion Park before it was bought up by the Australians.) We visited it today. The whole place is a depressing mass of Chinese, Hispanics, Blacks, and few Whites.<br>
  My mother is constantly astounded by the replacement that has taken place as am I. On the commercial streets there are Chinese-language sign everywhere! I call Arcadia, &#8220;Hong Cadia&#8221; because that is what most of it remarkably has become. Arcadia High School is now 66 percent Asian!  Whites build an area and then demonically delusional leftists and neocons give it over to these people and others! I certainly hope Ted Kennedy is paying dearly for his treason! </p>

		<p>Yellow Man, Bobby (#5) didn&rsquo;t say San Marino was a ghetto.  He said it was fairly well-to-do, which the figures you provide confirm.  But he was incorrect when he said it was part of Pasadena, it&rsquo;s a separate city.   Chinese don&rsquo;t live in Pasadena, because the schools are full of Blacks and Mexicans, even in the nicest parts of town.  </p>

<p>Sorry I also meant ghetto in the sense of an isolated ethnic enclave San Marion is still quite a mixed area:</p>
<p><a href="/pdf_forms/citymanager/CityofSanMarinoDemographics_pg1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.cityofsanmarino.org/pdf_forms/citymanager/CityofSanMarinoDemographics_pg1.pdf</a></p>
<p>I agree the Asians have definitely changed the area.  However I think all the evidence would suggest that it&rsquo;s really been for the better.  Note that I try to be objective in my analysis and this case I think immigration has helped the schools and the therefore the community immensely:</p>
<p>The High School is ranked #1 in LA County and #4 in the state:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino_High_School" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino_High_School</a></p>
<p>US News and World Report also lists it in its ranking of one of the best high schools in the US:</p>
<p>https://www.usnews.com/listings/high-schools/california/san_marino_high_school</p>
<p>Note that although we have some poor school districts in LA County there are some very wealthy areas as well such as Beverly Hills so San Marinio High&rsquo;s achievements are quite substantial.</p>
<p>If there are any drawbacks I think the most obvious one is that the schools performance could push property values to high levels.  According to Elizbeth Warren, chairwoman of the TARP overight commision, school quality profoundly affects property values because middle class parents bid the value of properties with desirable school districts.</p>
<p>The area seems to be an economic success and I would imagine if we do any correlations between Asian immigration and property values/education achievement I would imagine that they&rsquo;re probably positively correlated.</p>
<p>I think San Marino is a compelling case of immigration benefitting a community.  </p>

		<p>Yellow Man, San Marino has Not changed for the better, it was always an upscale town with good schools.  Those lovely suburban ranch houses on big lots were built long before the Chinese came.  The Chinese chose to buy there, and in neighboring Arcadia, because they were already better than most places in L.A. County.<br>
     Where Chinese have changed the schools for the better is San Gabriel.  When they couldn&rsquo;t buy houses in Arcadia and San Marino because there weren&rsquo;t houses for sale, and when they couldn&rsquo;t lie to the school authorities about residency and get their kids into those good schools, they got active about improving San Gabriel&rsquo;s schools.  Every time a house changes hands in San Gabriel, a Chinese is the buyer, and the Mexicans are being priced out.  The schools are objectively better, for Chinese.  But to Whites, the town is not improving, not when it&rsquo;s just a matter of replacing Mexicans and Whites with Chinese.  We don&rsquo;t want Chinese cities in our country.  What you regard as a compelling case of immigration improving a community is simply a case of a town becoming better for Chinese, not for Americans.  That is a compelling case of immigration destroying a community.  <br>
