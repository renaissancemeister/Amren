<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8427415.stm">Man Urged Son to Rape Cousin, 12</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, December 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man who encouraged his teenage son to marry and rape his 12-year-old cousin has been jailed.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old organised a sham Muslim ceremony between his son, then 16, and the girl at his home in Woolwich, south-east London, in March last year.</p>
<p>At Wood Green Crown Court the boy got an 18-month supervision order for rape.</p>
<p>The fathers of the boy and girl were both jailed for three years for inciting a child to engage in sexual activity following an illegal marriage.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s mother, 54, was given a 12-month jail term, suspended for two years, for the same offence.</p>
<p>She was also ordered to do 200 hours of community service.</p>
<p>The case came to light when the mother of the girl, who objected to the arranged &#8220;marriage&#8221;, told police about it.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard child abuse detectives then discovered several relatives of the boy had urged him to rape his cousin.</p>
<p>In a statement, the girl&rsquo;s mother said: &#8220;What happened to my daughter was a nightmare. These convictions will help us move on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking after the case, Det Insp Noel McHugh, who led the investigation, called it a &#8220;really awful crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;This has been an exceptionally challenging investigation and we are grateful to all those who assisted with the case and ensured the convictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The offences are incomprehensible and the victim is a truly brave girl who suffered at the hands of those who should have offered her protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s father, 29, and the boy, now 17, were ordered to sign the sex offenders register.</p>
<p>Neither the victim nor any of the guilty parties can be named for legal reasons.<br>

<p>Yes, in that ultra politically correct society they don&rsquo;t want to identify the perps so people won&rsquo;t look down on criminals.<br>

		<p>Big deal, this goes on all the time in the Muslim community all the time. Most of the girls get married by the time they are 15 or 16 so that they can produce as many kids as possible. One family I knew (mom was American (White) and dad was from Iraq) had a step family situation and since Islam is very strict about male and female contact as soon as the two step children (a boy and a girl) reached puberty they were not allowed to be together unchaperoned, even though they had been raised as brother and sister. The girl was showing signs or puberty at 12 so she was promised in marriage to a man who was 22 years old. Shortly after her 13th birthday she was sent to live with him. I am sure that he raped her the first night. Sadly to say, this girl was very small and petite for her age so she looked even younger than her years. </p>

		<p>Woolwich has a large Somali population.  That&rsquo;s the most likely ethnicity for this family.  </p>

		<p>Let me come at this from a different angle.</p>
<p>The rapist&rsquo;s mother is given a suspended sentence and ordered to do 200 hours of community service? Her son didn&rsquo;t rape the community, it is the girl he raped that deserves compensation (according to old Germanic law).</p>
<p>The guilty parties cannot be named for legal reasons? Back in the 1950&rsquo;s, there were no restrictions on naming felons. And here it makes little sense as they were ordered to sign the sex offenders register  &mdash;  whatever that means.</p>

&#8216;Family values&rsquo; appears to encompasses a wide spectrum of behavior.</p>
<p>Some &#8216;family values&rsquo; are not appropriate to our society and can be classified as criminal.</p>

		<p>Just more of the &#8220;vibrant diversity&#8221; we are going to have to learn to live with. Sick, all of it. We don&rsquo;t have enough home-grown pedophilies in this country, we have to import a few (million) more of them? The U.S.A. has become the dumping grounds of all the undesireable degenerates of every land on earth. </p>

		<p>To Urban Teacher:</p>
<p>This is Britain we&rsquo;re talking about. Some of the worst criminals cannot be named &#8220;for legal reasons&#8221;. Britain affords its convicted criminals more protection, than almost any other country on Earth.</p>
<p>Do you remember the little boy (aged around 4) who was taken by hand out of a department store, by two other boys aged 8 and 10, and murdered by them; a few years ago? Their leaving the store was caught on tape. The older boys were caught and prosecuted, but, to this day their names have never been released to the public.</p>
<p>In another case, a man who was convicted of rape of an underage girl, never was publicly identified, because he had a family, and British courts felt that to release his identity would cause &#8220;harm&#8221; to his family.</p>
<p>This from a country who provided all the sordid details of Princess Di&rsquo;s fornications, ad nauseum, worldwide; but they protect the identities of criminals. Go figure.  </p>

<p>The case you refer to was the murder of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Bulger" rel="nofollow">Jamie Bulger</a> by Jon Venables and Robert Thompson (both 10 years old at the time) in 1993.</p>
<p>I read recently that they are both living in Australia now.</p>
<p>In the present case, the court ruling against publication of the names was probably to protect the identity of the victim.</p>
