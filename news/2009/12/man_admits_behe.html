			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, December 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A CHINESE man has pleaded guilty to decapitating a fellow graduate student in January at a campus cafe at Virginia Tech university in the United States.</p>
<p>Zhu Haiyang, a 26-year-old from Ningbo in eastern China, will be sentenced on April 19 for the first-degree murder of Yang Xin, a 22-year-old graduate student from Beijing, court records said.</p>
<p>He reportedly faces up to life in prison.</p>
<p>Witnesses said there was no shouting or apparent argument at the Au Bon Pain restaurant before Zhu horrifically murdered Yang on January 21 using a large kitchen knife.</p>
<p>In a copy of a police affidavit published by local newspaper The Collegiate Times, the officer said that when she arrived at the scene she found Zhu holding Yang&rsquo;s head in his hand.</p>
<p>Virginia Tech was the scene of the worst school shooting in US history in 2007 when Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year-old Virginia Tech student born in South Korea, shot 32 fellow classmates and teachers to death before killing himself.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s up with the beheadings? Remember the Vince Weiguang Li case in Canada? He behead a sleeping passenger on a bus and partially cannibalized the remains. So schizophrenic Chinese are prone to beheadings? </p>

		<p>Virginia Tech was founded in 1872 and originally named the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College.  This proud school has certainly come a long way since it helped transform the American South and Midwest into one of the breadbaskets of the world.      </p>

<p>Yes, and when he pleads not guilty he&rsquo;s going to claim he found it.</p>

		<p>I have long suspected the fabricated myth of Asians being meek, docile, studious, well behaved, in short, the model minority was just that - a myth. While it is true that there are many Asians who do fall into this category, there are many more, I suspect, who are irrational, violent and are not much different than many other non-Whites.</p>

		<p>This story was a well kept secret.  It was not in the news or even on the internet.  Non-whites now get away with murder.  If you are Black, Tan, or Asian, brutal crimes are never reported.  Every white crime is a racist crime. </p>

		<p>No &#8220;gun control&#8221; propaganda to be harvested from this one.  Move along, folks, this isn&rsquo;t news, move along, move along.</p>
<p>Of course, the article <i>does</i> irrelevantly drag the 2007 shootings in, so I guess it isn&rsquo;t entirely wasted as propaganda, after all.<br>

		<p>Well, obviously we whites must work extra hard to make Asians feel more welcome in Virginia.  I mean, it must be our fault that these things are happening.  It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be Asians at fault. It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be preferable to stop importing them. My gosh, then we would have less diversity!  Who would even suggest such a thing! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m still more than just a bit curious as to why Zhu killed her.  I suspect she rejected romantic advances from him, but who knows?</p>

		<p>Seems odd that the source of this US based crime is an Australian newspaper.</p>
<p>And looking at just the first couple of pages for the google results for this headline, shows a few Right-wing blogs and a couple of other Australian news sources  (&#8216;Perth Now&rsquo; and &#8216;News.com.au&rsquo;.)</p>

<p>Sometimes I think I may be too suspicious and/or paranoid, but then you see that there clearly is undeniable omission and censorship when it comes to reporting on certain ethnic groups.</p>
<p>On the &#8216;meek Asians&rsquo; stereotype, according to the tone of this report I was reading last night on recent Chinese murders, there is a rise in particulary violent crimes as late in China too.<br>
&#8216;Family of five hacked to death in China.&rsquo;<br>
https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/mp/6624504/family-of-five-hacked-to-death-in-china/</p>
<p>Reminds me of the theory proposed in the new banner Ad in Amren&rsquo;s top left corner.<br>
https://www.religionofmacho.com/</p>
<p>We odviousily have too many people on this rock.<br>
(But I&rsquo;m not volunteering my people to aid in the necessary reduction, we&rsquo;re doing a good enough job in that department as it is).</p>
