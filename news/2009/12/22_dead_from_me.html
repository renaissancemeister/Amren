<h1>22 Dead From Measles in Zimbabwe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, December 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Twenty-two people, mainly children below the age of 5, have died of measles in Zimbabwe, the country&rsquo;s state media reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Herald on Tuesday reported the 22 victims had not been vaccinated, quoting health officials in the troubled country. Ninety cases have been confirmed nationwide, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Health and Child Welfare Minister Henry Madzorera told the newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an unwarranted loss of lives given the fact that measles is a preventable disease,&#8221; he said, according to the state-owned Herald. &#8220;In Zimbabwe, outbreaks of measles were rare because of sustained high vaccination coverage among all children. It is therefore important for parents to realize that vaccinating their children protects the individual children&#8221; from the disease and its complications,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is likely to further strain Zimbabwe&rsquo;s health system, which last year linked nearly 5,000 deaths to a cholera epidemic. In the past three months, five people have died from cholera, but the WHO said the situation will not be as bad as last year.<br>

&#8220;the White man&rsquo;s legacy of&hellip;..(insert excuse here)&#8221;.</p>
<p>I know that on a personal level that when you blame things on external factors, that yes you may get some sympathy/pity from being &#8216;the victim&rsquo;, but you also lose control of your own destiny.</p>
<p>Although living under &#8216;the big chief&rsquo; Mugabe means the only freedom you&rsquo;d get is, the freedom to be infected with a fatal strain of cholera (or the measles?), be free to spend a trillion dollars on a loaf of bread and be free to watch Chinese mining companies pay for Mugabe&rsquo;s latest palace or for Grace Mugabe&rsquo;s latest shopping spree&hellip; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yj9hky7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yj9hky7</a> (some of these stories are really disgusting on a &#8220;let them eat cat&#8221; level.)</p>
<p>And if the West intervened militarily of course there&rsquo;d be cries of imperialism, racist intervention or recolonization etc. <br>
As Amrener&rsquo;s know they had all the food producers they needed to feed the whole of Africa for goodness sakes(!) and make their economy strong.</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s no specific finger pointing in this article, but like the South African rape epidemic story yesterday, on that, is the African males penchant for polygamy (see Barack Snr&rsquo;s &#8216;family tree&rsquo;) also &#8220;a legacy of Apartheid?&#8221;</p>
<p>The blacks need someone to blame after they&rsquo;ve run a first world country into the ground, because there could never be any other reason for their constant failures could there?</p>
<p>I say let them wallow in their freedom, but just don&rsquo;t blame us you got what you asked for.</p>

		<p>As someone who lived in South Africa for 24 years, next to Zimbabwe, I am fast coming to the obvious conclusion that all those who were active in giving the terrorists in Sub-Saharan Africa their &#8220;freedom&#8221;, were actually very clever for the death rates and average life expectancies for the black masses have all returned to those highs that existed before the Europeans arrived 130 years ago when Dr Jamieson (Google him) and his group rode in on horses from South Africa looking for minerals.  The diseases such as measles, malaria and other usually non-fatal ones were all but eliminated by 1950/60 but as in the rest of Africa, they are returning with a vengeance plus of course the highest rates of HIV/AIDS in the world.  Cholera is a preventable diseas which is usually fatal and it has occurred in South Africa as well but the liberals etc all ignore these facts as they must skulk ashamed at what they have caused.</p>

		<p>Guilty Liberal, I can&rsquo;t believe that Rhodesia had health problems and/or famine the way that Mugabe&rsquo;s Zimbabwe has. Even the guilty white liberal press have found it in their hearts to condemn him (sparingly) on his campaign of terror against white farmers in his country. When you have a country of 11 million and some 2 million are in danger of dying from famine, your nation is one giant crisis.</p>

		<p>Mugabe blames the west for all of its problems and the populace is too stupid/complacent to challenge. The state of public health certainly has dropped since white rule as it has in other post colonial countries. He is old and cannot last much longer so it will be interesting to see what happens. </p>

		<p>Some African countries have asked Afrikaaner and Chinese farmers to lease land in order to produce the food and products that they previously did under white rule.  Nations that continue with Mugabe&rsquo;s attitude are doomed to starvation and disease.  Much of the West probably doesn&rsquo;t understand the level of superstition that permeates the sub-Saharan region, though in the case of vaccines, there may be a genuine danger of HIV due to improperly cleaned and re-used syringes and needles.</p>

		<p>When Dr. Livingston made his various treks through southern Africa, he wrote about finding large portions of the continent uninhabited. Those reports spurred the various European settlers to enter a part of Africa they had never gone into before.</p>
<p>NOW, we are seeing a depopulation of southern Africa and a RETURN to how it was prior to whitey? It seems so.</p>
