<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/08/sarkozy-sympathises-minaret-ban-switzerland">Sarkozy Defends Switzerland Minaret Ban</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ian Traynor, Guardian (London), December 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nicolas Sarkozy today voiced sympathy for Switzerland&rsquo;s controversial decision to ban the building of Muslim minarets, calling on religious practitioners to avoid &#8220;ostentation&#8221; and &#8220;provocation&#8221; for fear of upsetting others.</p>
<p>The French president said he was surprised by the widespread criticism of the outcome of last week&rsquo;s referendum in Switzerland when 57% voted to proscribe the building of new minarets in a country that has four, and is home to 400,000 Muslims.</p>
<p>Sarkozy&rsquo;s foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, promptly denounced the Swiss decision last week, saying he was shocked and scandalised and calling for the ban to be reversed.</p>
<p>But writing in the Le Monde newspaper, Sarkozy defended the Swiss in arguing for the necessity of the contentious debate on national identity he has sponsored in France.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you not be amazed at the reaction that this decision has produced in certain media and political circles in our own country,&#8221; Sarkozy said. &#8220;Instead of condemning the Swiss out of hand, we should try to understand what they meant to express and what so many people in Europe feel, including people in France.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was the first national leader in Europe to offer a detailed opinion on a decision that the Swiss government has criticised as discriminatory and probably illegal, if implemented.</p>
<p>Sarkozy called for discretion from France&rsquo;s 6 million Muslims, the biggest Muslim community in Europe, in their observance of religion, while pledging to fight all discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christians, Jews, Muslims, all believers regardless of their faith, must refrain from ostentation and provocation and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. practise their religion in humble discretion.&#8221; Muslims would need to find a way of integrating in France &#8220;without conflicting with our social and civic pact&#8221; while moderate Islam would fail if Muslims sought to challenge the country&rsquo;s republican value system or Christian heritage.</p>
<p>Sarkozy&rsquo;s intervention in the Swiss dilemma, Europe&rsquo;s first direct vote on Islam, came in the midst of the bout of navel-gazing over French national identity launched by his government last month.</p>
<p>Despite much criticism, Sarkozy argued that the Swiss vote showed there was no point in being in denial about such soul-searching. The national identity debate is running in tandem with proposals to ban the burka and critics argue that Sarkozy&rsquo;s initiative has degenerated into a populist proxy debate on immigration, with the president seeking to outflank the extreme right and steal their votes.</p>
<p>A major conference on national identity is to be held in Paris in February after the debate moved to parliament today, preceded by town hall meetings and heated internet discussions over the past month. Next month parliament is also to consider whether the burka should be banned and in Marseilles there is dispute over the planned construction of a Grand Mosque with a 25-metre minaret.</p>
<p>Martine Aubry, the opposition socialist leader, says Sarkozy is making a calculated attempt to stir xenophobia by calling for the public debates.</p>
<p>The Swiss referendum has attracted much criticism, including from the government and the churches in Switzerland. It singled out Islam for restrictions and is seen as discriminatory and in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>But the Swiss procedure has been seized on by far-right politicians in Italy, Austria, and the Netherlands as exemplary. The vote was unique to the Swiss model of plebiscitary democracy which compels single-issue referendums if 100,000 signatures are collected in an 18-month period.</p>
<p>Such direct single-issue votes are unlikely elsewhere in Europe, but newspaper opinion polls in Spain, France and Germany since last week&rsquo;s referendum have shown large majorities supporting a ban on minarets.<br>

<p>a)  What busines is it of Bernie Kouchner what Swiss voters choose to do?</p>
<p>b)  Here&rsquo;s a good example of Sarko and his good buddy Kouchner playing both sides of the fence   &mdash;   the old good cop, bad cop routine. Kouchner will appease the Moslems and left wing, while Sarko will gather the votes of the conservative French right wing who think he&rsquo;s their man.  (Elections are coming up in March, btw.) </p>

		<p>This is new tactic by certain members of the post-Western political class. Sarkozy is just as bad as all the rest. He only says such things to win support from French nationalists. Other &#8220;mainstream&#8221; politicians also occasionally throw nationalists a bone. For example, Vladimir Putin sometimes says that measures need to be taken to protect Russia&rsquo;s &#8220;native population&#8221;. But these are only words.  No actions ever follow. We need to judge politicians only by what they do. Sarkozy doesn&rsquo;t care one iota about France&rsquo;s indigenous population. If he did, he would actually do something, and not just say a few words that nationalists want to hear.</p>

		<p>Switzerland is perhaps the most independent-minded nation on Earth. It is NOT a member of the United Nations, and has not adopted the euro. I don&rsquo;t know if it is a member of the European Union. If it is, it should withdraw immediately.</p>
<p>Here is a country which conducted a democratic plebiscite on a national question. The people voted &#8220;no&#8221; on whether minarets should be built. The hue and cry that resulted from the outcome of this vote, deafened that following the Soviet invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. </p>
<p>Switzerland must stand tall. It&rsquo;s own government must realize the Swiss people cannot be taken for fools.</p>

<p>You mean Switzerland is not a member of the EU, right?  Switzerland has been a member of the UN since 2002.  They are, however, not a member of the EU.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t, but it is highly dependent on the EU.</p>
<p>Norway is also outside the EU. Denmark and the UK are outside the Eurozone.</p>

		<p>The same people that complain about there being a limit on minarets have no problems with their being absoloutely no churches in Muslim lands.  </p>

		<p>The problem is not Islamic culture. The problem is Europe is host to a genetically alien population who have no business to be there as permanent settlers. It does not matter if they behave like mullahs, rapstars or Victorian gentlemen. They all must be forced to leave. </p>

<p>Jasper is right.  But, within the leftist parameters that determine what is &#8220;respectable&#8221; discourse,  it is easier to speak of culture (which is acceptable to the left) than it is to speak of &#8220;race&#8221; (which is a forbidden topic to the left).</p>
<p>This shows how the ideological Left controls all permissible thought and discourse that is allowed in the public arena in all western countries. It MUST be done according to THEIR standards, or not at all. Even rightists must accept and use the terminology of the left in order to get their message out.</p>

		<p>Europe needs to kick its cheap labor habit ASAP if they want to avoid becoming like the US. Nationalists should look at Japan for an example of how a population with a low birth rate can sustain itself without importing cheap foreign labor. Also, Europe&rsquo;s immigration laws that favor immigration from old colonies need to be halted, especially during the global economic crisis.</p>
<p>Europe, wake up before its too late.</p>

		<p>To Anonymous:</p>
<p>Thanks for correcting me. I honestly had no idea Switzerland caved and joined the United Nations in 2002. There goes their long-standing neutrality.</p>
<p>What was the reason Switzerland gave, for finally joining the UN? </p>
