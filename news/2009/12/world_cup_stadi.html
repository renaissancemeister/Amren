<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8388001.stm">World Cup Stadium &#8216;Cow Sacrifice&rsquo; Plan Sparks Row</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, December 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A proposal to bless South Africa&rsquo;s World Cup stadiums by slaughtering a cow in each one has caused concern among animal rights activists.</p>
<p>The Makhonya Royal Trust, which put forward the idea, described the cattle killing ritual as a &#8220;true African&#8221; way of blessing the 2010 tournament.</p>
<p>Government minister Sicelo Shiceka has promised to lobby football&rsquo;s governing body, Fifa, in support of the plan.</p>
<p>But animal rights groups have demanded to be consulted over the plans.</p>
<p>The row comes as a South African judge refused to stop a separate traditional Zulu bull-killing ceremony from going ahead on Saturday, instead calling on parliament to look at the issue.</p>
<p>The National Council for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) has written to Fifa over the World Cup issue.</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Mohammed Allie in Cape Town says the NSPCA does not object to the ritual slaughter of animals.</p>
<p>But the group wants to ensure it is done in a humane way and wants to be involved in the process to ensure the welfare of the cattle, our correspondent adds.</p>
<p>The Makhonya Royal Trust, which co-ordinates African cultural activities, said the sacrifice was an important way of ensuring a successful World Cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must have a cultural ceremony of some sort, where we are going to slaughter a beast,&#8221; trust chairman Zolani Mkiva told Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sacrifice the cow for this great achievement and we call on our ancestors to bless, to grace, to ensure that all goes well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Shiceka, the co-operative governance and traditional affairs minister, was quoted in South African media as giving his support to the plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;The World Cup will be on the African continent and we will make sure that African values and cultures are felt by the visitors,&#8221; the Citizen newspaper quoted him as saying.</p>
<p><b>Legal challenge</b></p>
<p>The issue of cattle sacrifice was also discussed by a High Court on Tuesday, when Judge Nic Van der Reyden said the matter needed to be taken up by politicians.</p>
<p>Activists from Animal Rights Africa brought a legal challenge in an attempt to stop a traditional Zulu bull-killing ritual from going ahead at a harvest festival on Saturday.</p>
<p>Known as Ukweshwama, it involves a crowd of young men killing a bull with their hands, and is considered to be a rite of passage to manhood.</p>
<p>The judge in Pietermaritzburg said the activity was as important to the Zulu tradition as the Holy Communion was to Catholics, South Africa&rsquo;s Sapa news agency reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suggest that all parties sit down and agree whether video footage can be taken during the ritual so that this matter can be handled by parliament,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The activists said they had tried to lobby the Zulu king and the government, whose leader President Jacob Zuma is a Zulu, but had had no response.</p>
<p>However members of the Zulu royal family were believed to be at the court hearing.</p>
<p>The parties are due to return to court on Friday.<br>

<p>That is completely nonconstructive commentary and supports the notion that white nationalists are irrational bigots.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t see the controversy.  It&rsquo;s Africa and I expect them to embrace African tradition.  Their animal rights ethics do not need to be constructed on a European foundation.</p>

		<p>Can as many people as possible email PETA about this!  It is horrific! The animal suffers a great deal!  The ancestors`s blessing my foot! They couldn&rsquo;t even spell the word soccer- no soccer ball was a blip on their `cultural` screen!This is a barbaric ritual on par with voodoo.  Why must blood flow to bless a heap of concrete? I just wonder how many body parts were buried in the foundations of these stadiums to secure `luck`? Muti killings to ensure health and wealth are rife in South Africa. Truly a return to barbarism.  maybe a video of such a ritual killing should be posted on youtube to freak out the would be civilized travellers to the world cup.  But then many of them worship soccer above all-and any sacrifice will enhance the glorification! Moemi-in-distress</p>

<p>Animal rights groups piss me off. So worried over whether or not a cow will feel pain in it&rsquo;s final moment, yet they could care less about the kind of suffering their own kind are made to endure, and not far from the stadium no doubt. </p>

		<p>This will be in Africa and in true African tradition so don&rsquo;t be too concerned about it. Better the NSPCA and Animal Rights Africa worry about a few bulls than the thousands of human murders, rapes, mutilations and robberies that are an everyday feature of real life in RSA, just so long as the bulls are treated in a &#8216;humane&rsquo; way. Anyway, the entire football scenario worldwide is about mobs, violence, fighting and drunken vandalism in a direct contrast to the sportsmanlike behaviour by players on the pitch which provide an excellent role model for our young men. Hah!!  The bull sacrifice and hordes of howling and chanting Zulus jumping up and down in unison will arouse the visiting spectators to fever pitch and those who have not yet had their cameras stolen will be able to show their family and friends back home how tame UK football really is and demand that FIFA seriously consider a similar idea in Manchester and Liverpool.  If a player sustains a cut, does not the ref insist he leaves the pitch and then permits a &#8216;blood&rsquo; substitution? I doubt if this applies to bulls. Does the pitch have to be re-inspected after each slaughter to ensure players are not in any danger by getting tangled in yards of intestines or slipping on blood-soaked grass? Talking of safety, didn&rsquo;t the violent gang &#8216;taxi&rsquo; operators try to prevent the construction of the &#8216;Gautrain&rsquo; rapid rail link by attacking construction workers because they claimed it would affect their custom? Obviously the safe transportation of thousands of tourists, each loaded with a mobile phone, digital camera, nice watch, a selection of credit cards and a pocketful of cash would not be in the best interests of the black taxi gangsters who already shoot each other over trivial matters about taxi queues, customers and routes. This entire World Cup fiasco will put an end to the much declining RSA tourism industry already badly affected by continual reports about crime and mutilation of White farmers. The eventual outcome will not be undisputed, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not mince words here.  This ritual involves the bull having its scrotum twisted and testicles ripped out, its eyes gouged from its head, and its tongue pulled from its throat.  The procedure takes between 20 and 40 minutes before the bull dies a horrible death.</p>
<p>It is furthermore believed that the louder the bull can be made to bellow during this procedure the greater will be the approval of their ancestors.</p>
<p>The determination to perpetuate this ritual in the face of international disapproval highlights a genetic aberration in the Zulu race that has never allowed for the development of empathy to occur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brutal and savage ritual hardly comparable with the annoyance and quick death handed out in Spanish bullfighting.<br>

		<p>I note one official says, &#8220;We will make sure that African values and cultures will be felt by the visitors&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Translation: Rapes, armed robbery, murder, carjacking, assault and battery, pickpocketing and drug dealing. All against a backdrop of poverty.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I fear for the safety of non-Bantu visitors to South Africa; on the other, maybe they should see what Nelson Mandela has done for the new South Africa.<br>
Let them do so at their own risk.</p>

<p>I abhor cruelty to animals. </p>
<p>Of course I do: I&rsquo;m a white man. </p>
<p>The Zulu has never heard of cruelty to animals; and wouldn&rsquo;t care even if you explained it to him. </p>
<p>Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t: he&rsquo;s a black man. </p>
<p>As horrible and gratuitous as this bull-killing ritual is, it might just be the best thing to let it go on, in full view of the world. </p>
<p>Might alert some of our fellow animal-loving whites to the fact that African <i>just aren&rsquo;t like us</i>. </p>
<p>And that knowledge might someday prevent some of those whites from themselves becoming victims of horrible, gratuitous African violence. Because once those whites have seen what cruelty blacks are capable of, they&rsquo;ll regard them with the appropriate wariness. </p>
<p>This bull scheduled to be torn apart on live TV might be even more of a &#8220;sacrificial animal&#8221; than its Zulu tormentors realize. If by being sacrificed to Bantu bloodlust, this bull helps keep white people safer in future, then this poor, dumb, doomed creature will not have died in vain. </p>

<p>PLEASE!!!! How many of you have, for whatever reason, been to a Kansas City slaughter house? I have seen animals knocked out, dragged by their hind legs onto hooks and then come to just in time to feel their insides falling out onto the concrete, to feel their stomachs ripped out and flipped onto the dome like things for the Menudo and still alive for another few stations where other parts of their bodies are removed. I have also seen pretty much the same thing done to people!! so face reality, this is the true nature of man, and civility is a VERY THIN veneer.</p>

<p>He said that their ancestors were &#8220;stone-age primitives&#8221; [correct], with inabilities that are legendary [correct].   Instead of huffing and puffing with pompous indignation, can you just describe for us exactly what part of that statement is  inaccurate? </p>
<p>As for their African rituals, I say, &#8220;Fine!  Let them have their rituals and let have their games, but let everyone else stay away. <br>
Personally, I find it repulsive.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Animals die so that humans can eat animal tisuue. Cats are often horrid to mice and baby birds, too! Tough, innit?</p>
<p>Anyone who has spent any time in a society in which such things are unhidden has seen this sort of spectacle with their own eyes!</p>
<p>I recall a non-vegetarian hippie barbecue party in Lancashire which had a Grand Opening that involved a flying contest with three rival teams fielding headless chickens. [Actually, not all the viwers thought this suitable entertainment for children although the children greatly relished the spectacle.]</p>
<p>Most present-day Westerners grow up without even having seen a chicken killed, let alone a pig, goat or a bull.</p>

		<p>Anon. - 18 - asks &#8220;&hellip;why not a human?&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, if I were running, say, Detroit or even London, as a Benign Despot [a somewhat improbable prospect, sad to say] I&rsquo;d have condemned murderers hanged, shot by firing squad or guillotined in schoolyards with all the kids watching.</p>
<p>My guess is that watching someone being executed might - MIGHT - act as a disincentive to violent crimes.</p>
<p>Actually, I did see a public execution once. It was in Taif twenty-six years ago. A Filipino called Angelo Bibo was beheaded for stabbing a Saudi twenty-six times [fatally, of course] in disputed circumstances. Either Bibo was a rapist - the official Saudi version and the one accepted as true by the court - or he was the clandestine lover of the murdered man&rsquo;s wife, which was the version of events believed by many of the Filipinos in Taif.</p>
<p>The widow, realising that she had lost her husband and that her rapist - or lover - was bound to be put to death anyway, had the good sense to stick to the &#8216;rape&rsquo; version of events, since she felt no compelling desire to undergo death by stoning, the traditional Sharia punishment, or by execution with a Smith and Wesson 38 at close range, as is now done to women condemned to death in Riyadh and Dammam.</p>
<p>The Emir of Taif ordered all companies employing Filipinos to ensure that their Filipino employees were present so that all could behold the spectacle.</p>
<p>The execution itself was admirably dextrous and was carried out by the man who was the Kingdom&rsquo;s most accomplished executioner in those days - a guaranteed decapitation at a single stroke.</p>

		<p>Let me add something.</p>
<p>At the time of the &#8216;Mad Cow&rsquo; mass slaughters in the U.K. there was a TV panel discussion on the issue.</p>
<p>Polly Toynbee: &#8220;Well, appalling though the spectacle might be, we all accept that all animals on commercial farms are killed sooner or later anyway&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Stupid urban woman: &#8220;&hellip;but a lot of those were dairy cows!&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly Toynbee: &#8220;&hellip; and what do you think happens to Daisy and Buttercup at the end of their lactating lives? What do you think goes into the cans of dogfood in supermarkets?&#8221;</p>
<p>The poor silly urban woman looked stunned and appalled, much as though she&rsquo;d been hit in the face with a very large dead fish.</p>
<p>Up to that moment she probably thought that there&rsquo;s an immense green meadow somewhere full of retired dairy cows and aged non-laying hens, rather like a scene from &#8216;Babe&rsquo; or &#8216;Babe in the City.&rsquo;</p>

<p>because liberal idiots rule the society. In a more healthy society (well for some few hundred years ago) public executions were the norms for individums which betrayed country or committed serious crime. Public executions are a very effective way to ensure the rest of the community complies with the rules.</p>

<p>Mr/Ms Sear, European &#8216;animal rights ethics&rsquo; evolved along with other civilizing influences such as the development of empathy.</p>
<p>In the absence of empathy a human being&rsquo;s absence of rights tend to be aligned with the absence of those of the animal in the rituals to which the animal is subjected.</p>
<p>By way of example, note that two elderly women (a mother of 77 and her mentally retarded daughter of 57), were attacked in their home earlier this year by two black youths, stripped, had their vaginas lacerated with a broken bottle, and, whilst still alive, one had her breasts cut off.  The youths then sat back to watch their agonised deaths from loss of blood (Google &#8216;Helen Lotter&rsquo; for verification).</p>
<p>Do you still believe that African &#8216;animal rights ethics&rsquo; do not need to be constructed on a European foundation? <br>
