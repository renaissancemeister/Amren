			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), December 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White job applicants could be overlooked because of the colour of their skin under proposed equality laws, the Tories warned yesterday.</p>
<p>They said unclear wording in Harriet Harman&rsquo;s Equality Bill could lead employers to start discriminating in favour of minority candidates  &mdash;  rather than hiring on merit.</p>
<p>Men could also lose out if the legislation goes unchanged, Conservative business spokesman John Penrose told the Commons.</p>
<p>The Bill will make it legal for employers to choose a black or female candidate above a white man, as long as they have the same qualifications.</p>
<p>It is designed to thrust more women and minority applicants into senior posts.</p>
<p>But business leaders say the equality minister&rsquo;s Bill risks introducing positive discrimination  &mdash;  and would mean jobseekers are hired &#8216;because of who they are, rather than what they can do&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Penrose told the Commons yesterday that the wording of the Bill  &mdash;  &#8216;as qualified as&rsquo;  &mdash;  should be rephrased to &#8216;equally qualified&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He argued that the words &#8216;as qualified&rsquo; would mean that a black or female candidate could be discriminated in favour of.</p>
<p>During report stage debate on the Bill, he said: &#8216;We are worried that it might mean that you might have two candidates who are both adequately qualified  &mdash;  they clear a certain threshold required for that particular role.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, he added, the better candidate may not be given the job because the employer &#8216;will be perfectly within their rights&rsquo; to favour a less well qualified applicant who has passed the threshold and is from an ethnic minority.</p>
<p>&#8216;And that seems to us to breach this important distinction between positive action  &mdash;  giving people a hand in preparation  &mdash;  and positive discrimination which is allowing the decision on who is offered the job to be made on any other grounds other than strictly and purely merit,&rsquo; he said.<br/>

		<p>Even if the offending semantics in this legislation is removed, the net effect will be the same.  I&rsquo;m sure the UK has anti-discrimination laws, and they inevitably lead to positive/affirmative action, because employers have to hire some protected minorities to deter lawsuits and prosecution.</p>
<p>BTW, throwing gender in here is a trick to lure white women into countenancing the dispossession of their own race.  It rarely works out that they get to the top of the affirmative action food chain; black men have way more brownie points than white women, and black women more than either.</p>

<p>Harman actually wore a kevlar vest while touring through her area, which is mostly black of course. </p>

		<p>One of the major problems created by affirmative action legislation, be it here or in the UK, is that it forces potential defendants in discrimination cases to prove a negative, to wit &#8220;You&rsquo;re charged with illegal discrimination against the plaintiff.  You must demonstrate that you didn&rsquo;t hire this person because of (pick one) his/her age, his/her gender, race, ethnicity, religion, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government alleges nothing more than impure intent and the burden of proof accrues entirely to the the hapless defendant.  And unlike the defendant, be he an individual or major corporation, he doesn&rsquo;t have the unlimited resources to contest even the most specious claim.  The prosecutors (persecutors?) do.</p>

		<p>First they said that britain <i>needed</i> foreign workers to stay competitive. But now it looks like the goal is to displace indigenous workers.</p>

		<p>A law that was the exact opposite would be roundly defeated, if it ever got to the floor.</p>
<p>But actually such an opposite law favoring the white male group would be in fact fair.  This is because genetically white men group is as a group the best workers.  So even if the country were not engulfed in an atmosphere of anti-white bigotry where a pro-white law would offset the harm already done, the pro-white law would steer the best workers into the work force.   </p>
<p>Agreed there are many intelligent women.  But the feminist supposition that women and men are equal and that women should be favored to equalize their number in work force runs counter to the true nature of women and blocks them from fulfilling their authentic role as wife and mother.</p>
<p>The anti-white forces claim that sexist-racists laws harming white males are morally good because they advance the country.  Again this is contrary to the truth.  Pro-white laws would benefit all because the best workers would replace the second rate minority workers.  </p>
<p>Who do you want building and repairing your car, airplane, medical equipment?  Who do you want as doctor, lawyer, and financial advisor?  </p>
<p>While I have the floor:  I have been watching television since the early 1950&rsquo;s.  T V commercials for decades had an attractive white man or woman selling a product.  Not so any more.  Homely and stupid white men and women being set straight by minorities fill the T V screen for 99% of the commercials.  </p>
<p>The only time an attractive white man was used was as a pilot to sell an airline&rsquo;s service.  People won&rsquo;t fly on a plane piloted by a minority and no air line was dumb enough to run such a commercial.  But I noticed a new airplane commercial (Continental I think) came out with minorities and dumpy looking whites in it. They were the baggage handlers.<br/>

		<p>This is just WEIRD!  Here in South Africa the white male is worked politically out of the job market! The Black equality whatever deems a business unfair if white males are appointed! Correcting Aparthaid is the motivation-but why in England? France? Con-spiracy here on glabal scale? I ve noticed many trends that gets implemented in SA and then `exported` elsewhere.  Is South Africa the testing ground?  White males you`ve got a target on your back! So quit your happy drinking,drugging,debting and divorcing days and get a backbone!</p>

		<p>Well that should speed up our economic collapse, it seems to be what we need to fully awaken the people. I might live here but I invest my money in Russia and the far east. Its a grim future for us at the moment ut maybe the next elections will give us cause for hope.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity, you nailed it.  It is refreshing to see intelligent people like yourself who can see right through the ruses used by those that seek to destroy us.</p>
<p>But I am discouraged to see so few of us on these message boards, and so few political leaders that have the courage to be with us.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s becoming obvious that the main intention of the left is to eliminate White males, after taking all their money and giving it to politically preferred minorities.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting back story to Harriet Harman MP (or Harridan Harperson as she is known).<br/>
 Born to a very privileged family (she&rsquo;s the daughter of a countesss), Harman has always been on the extreme left of British politics.<br/>
 A few years back she publicly defied Labour Party policy when her precious son (interesting how she wants to discriminate against other White women&rsquo;s sons)took up a place in a selective (ie requires an entrance test) High School.This was and is a extreme anathema to Labour Party policy (they destroyed the education of countless millions of bright working class kids by insisting on &#8216;mixed ability&rsquo; teaching in High Schools), and Harman somehow managed to tough out extreme censure for her actions.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m reading this right, then it&rsquo;s illegal for schools to teach their students any level of what some bureaucrat thinks is advanced material.  And if I&rsquo;m right, I think race plays into it somehow, because teaching too many advanced classes will make whites go too far out ahead of certain minorities.</p>

		<p>This is the third blatant piece of evidence this year, which underlines Labour&rsquo;s anti-white racism. There was the case of the girl refused a job &#8216;because she was white and English&rsquo;; there was the case of a government office not being sited in Corby &#8216;because the area was too white&rsquo;. Now we have this disgusting piece of Labourite race-biassed legislation. Judging by some callers to phone-in radio (not the controlled, egregious, PC, politicised BBC) even the less perspicacious listeners are concluding that &#8216;Labour do not like the English&rsquo; - a phrase quite often heard.</p>

<p>   No, I&rsquo;m afraid &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; (giving preference to women and minorities) started in the United States. It has been part of our &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws for many decades. This is another bad neo-Marxist idea imported from America to Europe. In theory it sounds good but in reality it means quotas for unqualified candidates. </p>
