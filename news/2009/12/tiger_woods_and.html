			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael "Ice-Blue" Harris, HipHopWired, December 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Today while hanging out with Rev. Al Sharpton in the studio, {snip} one of the callers slammed the issue on the table like a five pound slab of raw chicken. The caller made the old OJ Simpson argument: &#8220;Had he been with a sister, none of this would have happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t agree with the caller&rsquo;s assertion (we know that marital drama knows no racial boundaries), I found it interesting that some of the black women in the studio smirked and looked at the floor, as if to say, &#8220;I hear ya girl.&#8221; These smirks were not built on agreeing with what the woman said, but rather, on the disappointment and resentment that many black women have felt about the fact that Tiger Woods almost never seemed to show any interest in African-American females. Unlike guys like myself, who admire Tiger for his achievements, I know a long list of black women who could care less if Tiger were to take his golf clubs and jump off the side of a 10-story building.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s comment about race, which again I did not agree with, led me down a trail of thought about Tiger Woods, race and how this incident is going to change the way we see him forever. One clear point that can be made relates to the OJ Simpson case. Before he was acquitted for the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson in 1995, OJ Simpson was America&rsquo;s favorite black man: He didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the black community and white America loved him as much as they loved themselves. He simply turned in his &#8220;brother card,&#8221; never to be seen in a soul food restaurant again. But fate changed all that, as OJ ended up relying on support from the black community to get him through his toughest hour. White America abandoned him for committing a mortal sin: Hurting a beautiful woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. Had Nicole Brown Simpson been black, it is arguable that OJ would never have been dealt with so harshly for the next 15 years.</p>
<p>Tiger may be in a similar situation with his wife Elin. I seriously wonder if Elin struck Tiger with that golf club, given that Tiger was going in and out of consciousness and drove straight into a tree. It&rsquo;s odd to me that one of the most focused human beings on the planet was unable to dodge large objects in the path of his automobile. But given that Tiger is the one being accused of committing adultery, one can only wonder if our society will decide that Tiger is the bad guy in this incident. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} So, the idea that Tiger Woods could become ostracized by the American public for the dirt now being released about his private life is not out of the question. {snip}<br>

		<p>Considering the source of this article, not much in the way of logic is to be expected.  But really, why <i>would</i> White people care if Woods had cheated on a black wife?  We aren&rsquo;t black.  And, as blacks never cease to remind us, what blacks do is none of our business.  We are White, and all that should matter to us in this story is the effect on a White woman of an interracial coupling.<br>

<p>umm&hellip;hurting?  I think savagely murdering her(and another person, who was a white male so I guess he doesn&rsquo;t really count) was the reason we &#8220;abandoned&#8221; him.  How unreasonable of us.</p>

<p>Hurting? The author of this nonsense makes it sound as if OJ Simpson kicked Nicole Brown Simpson in the shins or bruised her arm. He killed her. He slashed and stabbed her to death. And what of Ron Goldman who suffered the same fate as Nicole in the hands of the manaical OJ? Does this author view Goldman as some sort of collateral damage?</p>
<p>OJ was found not guilty by a jury of his peers   &mdash;  - a jury made up of poorly educated blacks. All his troubles or harsh dealings were a result of his own actions. How should a society treat a murderer, a thief, and an armed robber?</p>
<p>Interracial marriages or common-law unions seldom work. Perhaps these relationships never work out. Elin is a trophy wife plain and simple, and the mixed-race Tiger felt it was his right to shame het and embarass her by having multiple extra-marital affairs.</p>
<p>I agree with the black women cited in this article: I couldn&rsquo;t care less if Tiger ever played another round of golf. I guess I&rsquo;m with Churchill in viewing golf as a good walk spoiled.</p>

		<p>If this person doesnt think it would have mattered to the White Community if &#8220;Tigers&#8221; wife had been black he needs to look at the Black Communiy&rsquo;s acceptance within itself. The White Conservative Community gets up in arms up in arms over White leaders jaunts.</p>

		<p>This afternoon, a local sports talk radio station broadcasted a voicemail message made by Tiger Woods to one of his girlfriends. The woman recorded the message and released it to the media. In the message Tiger, sounding like a fourteen-year-old boy, pleads with the woman if she is ever going to call him at home again to remove her caller ID function as his wife sees the caller ID&rsquo;s on their home phone. He begs and pleads and urges the woman to quickly remove her ID from her phone system.</p>
<p>This recording was pathetic. Tiger you cannot possibly be the brightest cat in the jungle. If you&rsquo;re going to cheat on your wife and abuse your marriage then don&rsquo;t have your girlfriends call you at home, and don&rsquo;t leave compromising telephone messages either. </p>

<p>What is really laughable, is how blacks, like this Comrade Ice-Blue, attempt to &ldquo;deliberatively&rdquo; perceive these types incidents through the eyes of whites, and windup only showing how darkly lacking that they are in empathy as a people. Overall, they seem to think that whites, much like themselves, are an undulating mass of &ldquo;cryptocrystalline&rdquo; racially obsessed agitators, that see &ldquo;community&rdquo; and conformity to a fully internalized narcissism, as one and the same. They never realize, that whites are a diverse people, both socially and intellectually. Clearly, whites do have a semi-generalized set of standards, but these unfortunately do not always translate into even a nebulously universal sociopolitical dialect for them, much less a comprehensive sociopolitical language. </p>
<p>A case in point, is this &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; incident with &ldquo;saint&rdquo; Tiger, and his scorned and berserkergang harlot.</p>
<p>1.) The elite white media-corporate-political triad, is both aghast and titillated by the whole affair. To them, it is the equivalent of a really good episode of Jerry Springer (rebroadcast on PBS, of course) and an oddly enticing anti-multicultural horror film. It confirms what they know to be true but can&rsquo;t admit as such, so they are obsessed with it.</p>
<p>2.) The great silent and twilight majority, swirls in a mixture of indifferent nausea and bewildered interest on the whole subject. A &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; multicultural demigod that they have been carefully programmed to &ldquo;love,&rdquo; is being eviscerated in public; thus, a breaded and deep fried circus is to be enjoyed with a hazy and cold Budweiser gaze. </p>
<p>3.) Finally, are people like myself and (hopefully) most other race realists. The incident and reactions to it by others are amusing to us, but not unexpected at all. Reality has hit them square in the face, just like one of &ldquo;saint&rdquo; Tiger&rsquo;s clubs apparently hit him in the head before his accident. The only real surprise for most of us being, that it took this long for &ldquo;saint&rdquo; Tiger and his Swedish wife to show their true stripes.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>So this knucklehead says white America abandoned Simpson because he HURT a beautiful woman with blonde hair and blue eyes?  These idiots still can&rsquo;t manage to say that Simpson  KILLED Nicole and Ron Goldman.<br>
And I don&rsquo;t care what color your skin is, adultery is wrong.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black blogger says whites wouldn&rsquo;t care if Tiger Woods had been cheating on a black wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Well, so what?  The reason we &#8220;care&#8221; is because we love seeing her get some payback as a traitor to her race.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go one better, and say I hope more women come out with more recordings, if not now then a year or two from now.</p>
<p>Once a cheater, always a cheater.  He&rsquo;ll never change.  He is going through a temporary repentance right now, but he&rsquo;ll soon grow tired of it all and get him another one who&rsquo;s looking for a daddy big bucks.</p>
<p>Incidentally, what does this black think of the fact that Woods&rsquo; preference are all white women?  Doesn&rsquo;t that mean he thinks black women are unattractive, as most white men do and many black ones?</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>To get it straight, Mr. Woods is a tossed salad  of racial genes and is not to be considered &#8220;Afro-American&#8221;.  (He has made that clear himself.)  He has a variety of ancestries, of which the Afro-American part is only 1/4 at most.  To be more precise, since modern so-called &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; are not fully black anyway,   that would make Mr. Woods even less than one-quarter  Afro.   Perhaps about  one-fifth, at the most. Probably less.  His mother is Thai, but also Chinese and Dutch.  So it&rsquo;s really hard to pin him down. The modern cosmopolitan man of the future, you could call him, yes.  But you can&rsquo;t call him &#8220;black&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Thanks for a great read. </p>
<p>That many Black women hold such absurd opinions regarding race is nothing new. This is especially the case when the subject is <br>
interracial dating/marriage, and particularly, Black Male/Non Black Female pairings. As I&rsquo;ve posted at other website comments sections, the easiest way to bring out the stupidity and insecurities of low IQ Black women is to have Black men pass in front of them holding hands with non-Black women. Please note that this does not imply that all Black women have low IQs.</p>
<p>Many Black women suffer from several major attitude problems with regard to Black Male/Non Black Female pairings:</p>
<p>1) They assume that consensus of opinion is tantamount to validation. This is foolish: if you are simple minded, and the people who agree with you are also simple minded, your mutual agreement on a given opinion does not add credibility to it. If anything, it just clarifies how many people out there are just as stupid as you.</p>
<p>2) They conclude that Black men who intermix have bought into some sort of propaganda about Black female beauty, or lack thereof. This is foolish: it assumes that Black men who intermix are determined to avoid Black women.</p>
<p>3) They conclude that Black men who date non-Black, especially White, women can&rsquo;t handle a &#8220;strong&#8221; Black woman. This is foolish: it assumes that having a loud mouth, a sense of entitlement, and a chip on one&rsquo;s shoulder are signs of &#8220;strength&#8221;. </p>
<p>One redeeming quality about the blogger is that he at least disagrees with the sentiments expressed by the Black women here.</p>
<p>Still, I found it amusing that he would bring O.J. Simpson into this context. I couldn&rsquo;t see White America comparing O.J. and Tiger, even subconsciously. One is a murderer, the other one is apparently an adulterer. Elin could always pay Tiger back through divorce, or through infidelity of her own. Nicole Brown has no means of avenging herself. It&rsquo;s also important to remember that there were two victims in the O.J. <br>
Simpson atrocity, one of whom WAS NOT a blonde haired, blue eyed woman. Does the blogger assume that only Nicole Brown&rsquo;s murder had many White Americans angered toward Simpson? Besides, which is worse? Many White Americans hating a man who committed such a horrible act, or the many Black Americans who blindly supported him in spite of it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s far more relevant here, which &#8220;Ice-Blue&#8221; fails to recognize, is whether or not Elin will be punished for an act which no man could escape punishment for. If she attacked her husband with a golf-club for an act of infidelity, that is a criminal act and should be treated accordingly.</p>

<p>Masses of black women are personally disappointed and feel resentment about Tiger Woods marriage? This guy needs to get out more, then he might understand why black women are disappointed and feel resentment about things a little closer to home. </p>

		<p>Good post from ICE&hellip;poster # 8.</p>
<p>I concur. Elin is a White race traitor and I am not concerned with her &#8220;pain&#8221;. As for Tiger, he has always been a cheater, so what is new? Did Elin really believe a mixed race man like Tiger would be faithful? Like it has been said, she was a trophy wife. Black men don&rsquo;t hold up their own black women as desirable or as &#8220;trophies&#8221;. At the same time most White women don&rsquo;t look at the race traitor woman as &#8220;White&#8221; any longer. I don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>With Tiger&rsquo;s complicated bloodline, any marriage he entered into would be interracial. </p>
<p>But I will give Tiger credit for one thing. Despite everything that has come down on him during the last week, he has not (thus far) played the race card.</p>
<p>Contrast that with Michael Jackson and O.J. Simpson. Both, like Tiger, made a conscious choice to concentrate their commercial efforts on the more lucrative (White) market, and avoided any statements, activities and company that would draw attention to their race. But as soon as Michael Jackson and O.J. got into trouble, they didn&rsquo;t think twice about pulling out an entire deck of race cards to rally their troops. </p>

<p>WOW! No, wait please. DOUBLE-WOW!! What a classic example of disingenuous black non-logic. In the first place putting aside the supposed treating of O.J. &#8220;harshly&#8221; just because he killed two White people, the obvious retort here is that IF she had been black the black jury would have had vastly more sympathy for her, his sleazy defense team would have found it incomparably harder to shamelessly play the race card and the jury might very well have found him guilty.</p>

<p>It would also help if thousand of White Males found something better with their time than sitting in sports stadiums drooling over young black multimillioniares in tight spandex running up and down the field.

&#8220;To get it straight, Mr. Woods is a tossed salad of racial genes and is not to be considered &ldquo;Afro-American&rdquo;. (He has made that clear himself.) He has a variety of ancestries, of which the Afro-American part is only 1/4 at most. To be more precise, since modern so-called &ldquo;African-Americans&rdquo; are not fully black anyway, that would make Mr. Woods even less than one-quarter Afro. Perhaps about one-fifth, at the most. Probably less. His mother is Thai, but also Chinese and Dutch. So it&rsquo;s really hard to pin him down. The modern cosmopolitan man of the future, you could call him, yes. But you can&rsquo;t call him &ldquo;black&rdquo;. &#8216;</p>
<p>To clarify things more than that, old boy, let me inform you that people are what others regard them.  Do you naively think that blacks consider Obama anything but black?</p>
<p>And do you naively think that blacks consider Woods anything other than black?  Or how about the sports writers and other media who refer to him as the most successful black in golf?</p>
<p>The whole world regards Woods as black yet it seems to bother you that they do.  While your explanation is correct, it&rsquo;s absolutely useless in the real world and will change nobody&rsquo;s mind.<br>

		<p>No one likes to be the last ones chosen, and that is what black women are. There are a few mixed-breeds that win contests, according to the press-pushed pc-think of our times, but black women, like most blacks, are realists, and know the score.</p>
<p>It rankles them, understandably so. </p>
<p>This realism, or lack of idealism, among blacks leads to some bleak conclusions. Things that depend on idealism  &mdash;  marriage, democracy, charity, the arts, a trusting society  &mdash;  all perish at their hands.</p>
<p>That is why I expect Obama, eventually, to go the way of Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>It is so common-sense obvious  &mdash;   this downward-going among blacks  &mdash;   but Whites, who have idealized equality, will not be convinced by brown-dirt, summer-sweat, muscle-aching common-sense. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I know a long list of black women that could care less if Tiger were to take his golf clubs and jump off the side of a 10-story building&#8221;.</p>
<p>I guess this white man agrees with those black women. As long as Tiger doesn&rsquo;t hurt anyone I could care less what he does. He married a white woman but that&rsquo;s not against the law and it was her choice. I actually think there are women that would marry a snake if the snake were rich enough. </p>
<p>The Simpson incident is a different story. If you commit murder people tend to notice more and if you make a big scene by fleeing from the cops on national TV it really puts you in the spot light. Simpson was responsible for much of the publicity in his trial by not going along peacefully when they came to arrest him. Simpson wanted the publicity so he could by tried by public opinion rather than by a jury of his peers. If there hadn&rsquo;t been so much publicity Simpson would have been found guilty. His defense team knew what they were doing by making it into a show trial. </p>

		<p>What is so surprising about this?  Another black guy who can&rsquo;t keep it it in his pants just for his wife.  And do I feel sorry for her - absolutely not.  It boggles the mind that white women continue to gravitate to black men who have a horrible history of infidelity and abandonment.  Of course, white men do the same thing but it is not near the percentage of black men.  With 70% of black children in this country, living in homes without fathers, I&rsquo;m going with the lower percentage.</p>
<p>Of course, in this situation, money plays a huge part.  Lots of women and I know a couple myself (not on the Woods scale) that are currently staying with husband&rsquo;s who are cheating on them. Why because they want to keep their big $500,000 houses and Cadillac Escalades and their membership at the country clubs.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for trying to keep a marriage together, especially when there are children involved but staying in a marriage for the money and prestige&hellip; material wealth gets you nothing.</p>

Now we are so brainwashed (Sampson &amp; Delilah) style&hellip;we think its our duty to force this nonsense on others.  In truth I admire intelligent vital women but the excess that femminisation has gone to is probably the central dynamic in the breakup of the American family as well as the undoing of the white race. It&rsquo;s failure I believe ) lies in going overboard in exorcising excesses of our patriarchal past. When large groups of white men imitate black male culture in sports or ghetto culture&hellip;we also can&rsquo;t blame our women for opting for the (supposed) real thing.</p>

<p>Excellent post, as usual, paisan. I too, love how the MSM is all of a sudden tripping over themselves, trying to explain Woods&rsquo; situation. He has been thrust upon us, 24/7/365 by a fawning, adoring media ever since he burst onto the golf scene, and now, they don&rsquo;t know what to make of the fact that he has cheated on his wife. The same people who thrust him upon us, in the media non-stop, are now saying that Woods should be accorded his privacy. Well, that dog don&rsquo;t hunt. The &#8220;King of Golf&#8221; is slowly being torn down, and everyone loves to see the rich and powerful being being knocked off their pedestal. There is some joy in that they are finally revealed as having faults.</p>
<p>Remember Tina Turner being slapped around by Ike Turner for some 20 years? Why didn&rsquo;t that get any air time? The reason is such behavior is tolerated in black communities, as long as both parties are black. Imagine the reaction, if Mel Gibson slapped around Tina Turner.</p>
<p>Just as it was with Jack Johnson, O.J. Simpson and now, Tiger Woods, miscegenation doesn&rsquo;t work. Want to make book that the Heidi Klum-Seal marriage will be the next to break up? It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me to see that relationship hit the deck.</p>

      In parts of Oceania, the people have kinky hair. Much of Southeast Asia was once populated by Negritos-smaller versions of the Papuan type-along with other Peoples. The Polynesians expanded out into the Pacific and some of the Negritos did too. And there has been some mixing between the two groups over the centuries but they are still distinct with the Polynesians in the majority.</p>

<p>Who but a deluded, pompous, self-pitying, self-righteous black would write such arrant nonsense?   Just the mere snippet above is full of inaccuracies. First, her eyes were brown, not  blue (a small matter, but he&rsquo;s making an issue of it), she was a bleached blonde with plastic surgery and  jungle fever, the &#8220;black community&#8221; (which he had virtually abandoned) foolishly rallied to support this double  murderer   &mdash;   to their eternal shame(just as they did with Michael Jackson, showing how they&rsquo;re too dense even to take a hint when they&rsquo;ve been rejected).  So tight is their solidarity, and so great their obtuseness, that they will support any black criminal   &mdash;   even one who has turned his back on them!  Is that stupid or what? They&rsquo;re too dumb to take an insult.  And how on earth has OJ been &hellip;&#8221;dealt with so harshly&#8221;?  Even the electric chair would have been merciful, considering what he did&hellip;and got away with.  It&rsquo;s clear which side this author is sympathetic to:  the smirking black murderer who went free, not the dead white victims!   </p>
<p>Just more  &#8220;black logic&#8221;!  But thank you very much Mr.Harris, for revealing to us once again these twisted thought processes that are so typical. This is an excellent example  of why blacks should never be allowed in any positions of authority or given any power. They haven&rsquo;t a whit of common sense; they can&rsquo;t connect facts, piece them together logically, and come out with a rational answer.  Every black-run country provides a vivid illustration of what happens when they get in control.  Utter disaster!</p>
<p>Even the current article on Cuba demonstrates that the Cubans have better sense (than we do) to keep them out of positions of power from which they would only wreck the country.  Cubans may preach to others (abroad), but  Communists or not, they don&rsquo;t intend to allow that.  Not at home!</p>

But I notice that you don&rsquo;t  mention ANYTHING about Black/White marriages which, after all,  is the real topic of this thread.</p>

<p>Now that you mention it, I know a couple at work, (I am a high school teacher) a White male who is married to a Black woman. They have been married for 10 years. </p>
<p>My children who are in their late 20s and early 30s know a number of Black/White and other interracial couples who are happily married.</p>

<p>You are correct. Woods was introduced to his wife by Jesper Parnevik. </p>
<p>On another note, I wish that some of you posters would take the time to find out if something is true or at least let your emotions calm down before you start posting on this board with comments accusing anyone who says something you do not like of being either, Black, a White radical, a man hating feminist and other examples. I have no doubt that we get the occasional troll, however, there are many times when people print things we may not want ot see that are in fact true. Tiger Woods wife being introduced to him by someone he knew is such an example. </p>
<p>The fact is that such accusatory comments (especially when they person being accused of being fraudulent is in fact, telling the truth)does AMREN, the website and the movement no good and it gives ammunition to those who are trying to do actual harm to the cause of Whites.</p>

<p>Very well. And so what?  Merely &#8220;introducing&#8221; someone does not amount to &#8220;disgracefully setting someone up&#8221;.  Big difference!</p>
<p><br>
I have introduced people too, as I&rsquo;m sure we all have, but anything that happens after that is entirely up to them.  Nobody forces them to go and get married!</p>

		<p>To Soprano Fan, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same people who thrust him upon us, in the media non-stop, are now saying that Woods should be accorded his privacy. Well, that dog don&rsquo;t hunt. The &lsquo;King of Golf&rsquo; is slowly being torn down, and everyone loves to see the rich and powerful being knocked off their pedestal. There is some joy in that they are finally revealed as having faults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is a really good observation above SF, outstanding in fact!</p>
<p>The Marxstream media does seem to have quite a problem on their hands, do they not. They are committed to the multicultural &ldquo;ideal,&rdquo; and yet are engaging in the normal feeding frenzy with &ldquo;saint&rdquo; Tiger that they would with any other celebrity; in fact, it seems to be even more intense with their diversity poster boy here, because of his carefully cultivated image (both by his PR people and themselves) as being &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; and &ldquo;wholesome.&rdquo; It is as if they are reacting &ldquo;rebelliously&rdquo; on some subconscious level to their own rigid multicultural nomenclatura, just as strictly controlled teenagers often semi-overtly do, once they obtain some limited freedom when they are sent off to college. In short, it&rsquo;s party time, and mommy and daddy are paying for it in more ways than one.</p>
<p>I mean, have you heard the tapes with the mongrelized wunderkind, pathetically begging his one &ldquo;lady&rdquo; friend to erase her phone contacts with him, so his wife can&rsquo;t call her. Pretty damaging stuff for a diversity demigod, to say the very least.</p>
<p>All the best to you SF, and you have a great weekend,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>
<p>PS, here is an opening video and a second one, from a series of clips on YouTube, taken from a documentary on the underground humor found in the former USSR, called &ldquo;Hammer and Tickle.&rdquo;  I think you might enjoy them:</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think this marriage was a good idea, mainly for the interracial aspect.  And if there were any racial angle to notice here, or to come into play, I&rsquo;d notice it.  But all this is just a husband cheating on his wife, nothing more, the couple heading for a quick and costly (for him) divorce.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a matter of typical black behavior, because Tiger Woods isn&rsquo;t a typical ghetto black (in fact, he isn&rsquo;t at all.)  </p>
<p>As as a Phil Mickelson fan, and one who thinks that Jack Nicklaus will still be the greatest golfer of all time even after Woods is done (hint:  Nicklaus, along with his 18 majors, also has 19 second place finishes in majors, that&rsquo;s almost ten years of either 1st or 2nd places in majors), I fear that Woods is going to have the best season of his life next year.  A lot of his endorsements will be nullified due to morals clauses, and his bank account will be depleted by some nine figures, so all he has left is golf.  His father raised him to bank his endorsement money and live off his tour winnings, so he&rsquo;s going to be at bay, and therefore dangerous.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the interracial white/whatever couple is happy.  Nature says that the white is making his/her genes extinct in his/her interracial children because most &#8220;white&#8221; genes are recessive.  This means, simply, that it takes two whites, a white male and a white female to produce a truly white child.  A child of any other union is not truly white.  Sorry, if the flatworld race deniers don&rsquo;t like this, but that&rsquo;s nature for you.  </p>

<p>You should have presented your facts.  I questioned your sources, and with good reason. Sources which you/he did not bother to give. It&rsquo;s normal when making accusations of that sort to give sources. I do not notice any egg on my face. The mere simple fact that they were  innocently &#8220;introduced&#8221; by a friend means nothing.   Nothing further about it was said in the article.  Where does the &#8220;shamefully set up&#8221; part come in?  I never found any source or quote for that wild claim about a shamneful set up.</p>
<p>Yes, I checked out the facts. But I should not have had to go searching. The person making the allegation that they were &#8220;shamefully set up&#8221;  should have presented them with his allegation.  He did NOT give any sources because there were NO  allegations of any &#8220;set up&#8221;.  He twisted and distorted the story to suit his purpose. I&rsquo;m afraid that egg you were talking about is on YOUR/HIS face, nobody else&rsquo;s.  Next time, don&rsquo;t give false assertions and then claim later that somebody (else) should have checked the sources. You should have given them!</p>

		<p>Regarding introductions: Almost anytime you introduce a female to a male, you are creating a sexual situation.  Do they not inspect each other?  The warning teachers get about the sexual potential of all dealings with teens is one of the few truthful things were taught in ed school.  Even grannies and granpas check one another out.  If the two people you introduce are single, the situation is more sexually charged.  If it&rsquo;s a total babe Swede and an ultra rich sports star, the hormones will be buzzing.  If he&rsquo;s Black, or Blackish, you are a pimp.  No White should EVER bring a Black male and a White female together.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Modern White American culure is sick and diseased. NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN teenagers are dying in Afganistan in an attempt to impose this vapid and rancid culture on the people of Afganistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The culture that&rsquo;s represented in the media is a far cry from real American culture.  Most of our athletes, our heroes, our music, etc. are manufactured for us and given alot of fanfare from the media to build a base of popularity . Some people take the bait and get sucked into the brainwashing to idiolize these people just because they are told to by the TV.  Tiger Woods is just such an example.  I&rsquo;m willing to bet there were better amateur golfers out there to promote but Woods was promoted because he&rsquo;s black and also a genetic slop bucket of other things.  I don&rsquo;t care anything about Tiger Woods or his personal life but the media wants me to be intrigued by it even though it&rsquo;s about as interesting as watching the grass grow.  Of course you have people in the media who say they feel the same way I do yet they constantly talk about it as well to feed the publicity frenzy.  <br>

		<p>I am not sure that Tiger Woods reject the Black community or has contempt for Afro and Asian women. He is an offspring of both races.<br>
The diatribe about his mistresses is an ad hominen fallacy; [guilt / honor by association] depending on the premises. <br>
He might have a preference for blonde but this is not a sacrilege to the Afro and the Asian communities. He has a right to pick the woman he likes without third party interferences.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s speculating as to why all the women on the so called &#8220;scandal&rdquo; are Caucasians.<br>
The PGA of America has 28,000 members only 145 are Afro-American; that represent less than one percent of Afro-American in golf. Golf is predominantly a Caucasian oriented sport. This implies that the chance for him to meet an Afro-American woman in a golf environment is negligible or almost nil; consequently, the women he met in golf setting are Caucasian.</p>
<p>His indulgence in profligate amours should not be a surprise. Scientific observation suggests that polygamy seem to be prevalent throughout the animal kingdom  &mdash;  from birds to Homo sapiens; monogamy tends to be a rarity in nature. This is a biological reality. If you have any doubts about it check the history of: Sumerian, Babylonia, Phoenician, China, Egypt, ancient Greece, Roman Empire, Byzantine, Elizabethan times, the French, The Russian, and modern day America. Monogamy started in Western Europe and it was artificially imposed to several countries in the West for economic reason. To conclude: Jacqueline Kennedy said: &ldquo;I do not think there are any men who are faithful to their wives.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Tiger Woods vs Michael Jackson<br>
Ok, this is getting pretty low when the CEO of Yahoo Carol Bertz says &#8216;God Bless Tiger&rsquo; admitting how much traffic this scandal is sending to Yahoo. In fact, many blogs are now saying searches on <a href="https://www.dozensports.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view&amp;news=news_desc&amp;id=741&amp;Itemid=41" rel="nofollow">Tiger Woods</a> have been better for sports websites listed on sports index Dozensports.com than Michael Jackson dying. Are we witnessing one of the first major internet scandals? The immediacy of the internet means that we can now all read minute-by-minute updates of Tiger&rsquo;s transgressions. But comparing it to Michael Jackson is just plain low. The whole world has an opinion on Tiger Woods but for God&rsquo;s sake let&rsquo;s leave the dead out of this.</p>
