<h1>Portland School Board OKs New Hip-Hop High School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KOMO-TV (Seattle), December 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Portland School Board has given its blessing to establishing a new charter high school in 2011 that highlights hip-hop music and culture. Proponents of the High School for Recording Arts Portland will spend the next 18 months strengthening their academic curriculum.</p>
<p>The school board vote was 6-0 Monday night. While several board members said they had concerns about the school&rsquo;s academic curriculum, they also said they appreciated the school&rsquo;s potential to draw students who aren&rsquo;t being served in the current system.</p>
<p>The new school&rsquo;s director, Erica Jayasuriya, says its mission is to prepare students to be successful in society while engaging them through the recording arts that include hip-hop music, dance, spoken word and art.</p>
<p>The new school aims to serve about 200 students.<br>

		<p>One thing we know for sure:  The school will have a dress code.  For the young men, baggy pants, boxers, and preferably no shirt, but an NBA jersey costing at least $300 will do.  And at least five gold neck chains.  For the young ladies, well, I don&rsquo;t think AR likes the kind of words to describe their dress code.</p>
<p>Seriously, I read nothing in this article explaining why hip hop will help the cause of academics.  It says that the school will students &#8220;who aren&rsquo;t being served in the current system.&#8221;  You mean after decades of deseg, affirmative action, race norming, grade inflation and course title inflation, plus handing out diplomas like candy, they still aren&rsquo;t &#8220;being served?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Because nothing is going to help the average black kid growing up in the Pacific Northwest like learning how to rap, DJ and paint graffiti. Whatta sad joke - not just for the taxpayers paying for this nonsense, but for the kids themselves.</p>
<p>The best thing to do for a black kid growing up in a Pacific Northwestern city like Portland or Seattle is for them to MOVE - move to a black city. There really shouldn&rsquo;t be any minorities in the northwest at all.</p>

		<p>Whenever I read about these charter schools that serve black students I can&rsquo;t help but get a mental image of a black student &#8220;engaging&#8221; some White truck driver. I mean who are these kids going to be able to relate to with their hip-hop skills?</p>

<p>Actually, I believe one of the classes offered at the new school will be entitled &#8220;You Got Served!&#8221;  And I&rsquo;m sure that the local business community will be anxiously awaiting the first crop of graduates from this fine institution of higher education&hellip;</p>

<p>The establishment of anything that creates a bigger divide between whites and blacks has the blessings of many of us.</p>
<p>They have their black Jesus, now let&rsquo;s help them get their separate schools that teach urban rap, and maybe they&rsquo;ll adapt a black Santa Claus and a black Easter Bunny, Kwanza, etc.</p>
<p>I wish them well, so long as they continue to work towards constructing a parallel society, culture and traditions.  It&rsquo;s o.k. too, if they make ebonics their official language.</p>
<p>After all that, I would vote for giving them two states to relocate to as well, and cheer them on every step of the way.</p>

		<p>Yes, I live in southern Oregon, spent time in Portland, and although it is overwhelmingly white (I believe 6% black, in a metro area of about 2 million, which would still give you well over 100,000 blacks, which is a large population, especially if concentrated in one area, which it is), it is very, very liberal, which is such a shame because the area is beautiful and the city very liveable.  Just a couple of nights ago the black gangs of Portland were featured on Gangland on the history channel, and they have more or less been invited, coddled and empowered by the diversitoids.  This is just one more step on that road, and in the long run, is very good for WN causes, as they will get what they deserve in Portland in the long run, thus exposing the diversity lie one more time.<br>

		<p>8 Ice has got it here.  This is just a back door to segregation.  The school will be praised as a success, expanded to absorb more Blacks out of White schools, and the Black administrators will be given carte blanche to spend their budgets as they see fit, lining their own pockets, of course.  This will simply be a day care center to keep young Blacks amused and away from Whites, and to keep dumb Black teachers busy.  The school board knows that most Blacks are uneducable and wholly disruptive, and this is their solution.  </p>

		<p>Part of the &#8220;dress code&#8221; for the &#8220;hip-hop rap academy&#8221; will be pants that are required to be worn drooping so that the inmate&rsquo;s (oops, I mean &#8220;student&rsquo;s&#8221;) underwear shows.<br>
There will also be classes in prison behavior, the proper stance for being handcuffed and &#8220;prison fashion&#8221; (orange jumpsuits and flip-flop sandals).<br>
Of course, &#8220;ebonics&#8221; will be a required language.</p>

Let them resegregate themselves. Don&rsquo;t mock it but rather encourage it!! Anything that will keep them the Hell away from us.I&rsquo;ll even contribute the the GTA (Grandmother Teacher Association). If this new trend takes hold, it could spell a Renaissance for American education.</p>

		<p>Funny to set up a hip-hop school when,as all popular music trends go, hip-hop has already outlived it&rsquo;s popularity bracket in time and is slated to be replaced by the next trend which will not be hip-hop. Like the all ebonics school that was so short lived in Oakland, California, this idea is the culmination of short sighted, feel good planning and will amount to exactly zero after the first 3 years.</p>

		<p>School is suppose to teach children productive life skills.  It is a fallacy that song and dance are skills that allow most people to overcome their circumstances.  The Portland effort is not Julliard, its appeasement to get uninterested kids to attend an institution that losely resembles school. This is like the black street language movement of ebonoics a decade ago.  Teach kids an unusable skill that assures they if they use it they will be doomed to the underclass.  The irony is that well-meaning liberals were backing a program that assured failure in life.</p>

		<p>Another problem with this hip hop school is that it&rsquo;s based on a current trendy genre of &#8220;music.&#8221;  What if hip hop goes out of style?  It would be like the Portland Public School Board starting a disco school exactly 30 years ago, in December 1979.  By the end of the next year, it would already be obsolete. </p>
<p>I think the reason hip-hop/rap have survived a lot longer than disco is that it has actually been several distinct stages.  The first rap sounded like disco with fast rhyming from the late 70s to mid 80s.  Then came the hardcore &#8220;gangster&#8221; style from then to the early part of this decade, and now it&rsquo;s morphing into a weird mix of something that sounds like alternative and heavy metal.  But the point is that everything changes in music and quickly, and creating a school dedicated to a genre is short sighted.</p>

		<p>The stupidity of professional educators never fails to amaze me.  Did Oregon get some kind of sweetheart deal from the Senate where they have so much extra money they feel OK about shoving it down a rathole?  Hiphop isn&rsquo;t even music; it&rsquo;s pulsation, period.  A beat.  Kind of like primitive people produce for tribal rituals, you know?  It has nothing to do with education.  I&rsquo;ve got a B.A. in music - in serious musical circles this junk is laughed out of existence.  And I do happen to know several people in the recording biz - trust me, they don&rsquo;t hire black jiving hiphoppers.  They want professionals, not dilletantes.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Portland but from what I&rsquo;ve heard from people who have visited that city, they all say that the inhabitants are mostly 1960&rsquo;s leftover hippie types, so it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that they would approve of such a &#8220;school?&#8221; But that school board might be on to something.  I&rsquo;ve always thought that if you could subjects like mathematics to music that blacks might learn better.  Maybe hip-hop is the answer.  Something like this might work.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s an admission that black kids simply CANNOT learn.  This is a ploy to get the dumbest of the black kids into a school from which they might &#8220;graduate&#8221;.  This is the logical extension of ebonics, revising SAT&rsquo;s to reflect ghetto language and culture, installing easy A courses such as African American history, African American Arts, African American culture, etc.  None of that has worked.  They are still stupid, and they are still failing.  So, logically, make a High School that does and demands of them ONLY that which they know and then brag about the high rate of graduation.  Lipstick on a pig.  </p>

<p>I completely agree with you. There is no reason why blacks should be in the Northwest. I live in Portland and what is funny is that if you ride the MAX when a black comes on board, the whites are terrified. I grew up in Washington DC and I can tell you that the blacks in this part of the country are a cheap knockoff of East Coast blacks, which makes them even more pathetic, since they obviously have the opportunity to accomplish things in a white, overwhelmingly liberal city, but choose not to. They are so pathetic that not only are they unable to speak English, they are also incapable of speaking ebonics as well. </p>

		<p>Oh Boy, I can see where this is going.  Hip-Hop equals glorification of gang lifestyle.  Eventually the west side of the school will start a rivalry with the east side of the school with murder being the order of the day.</p>
<p>So lets get this strait, the hip hop culture will be used as a basis for learning in a high school setting?  Heck, why wait untill high school?  Why not start them off in early elementary school?  The backbone of hip-hop culture is glorification of gang violence, degredation of women, drug useage, racial hatred, and boastfullness minus achievement.  Hey, these are academic skills we all should&rsquo;ve had drilled into our brains at an early age.  </p>
<p>As if the people who live by this wretched noise aren&rsquo;t prone to violence enough the way it is.  Lets TEACH it to youths who will soak it up like a sponge.  </p>

<p><br>
Yes, it is.  However, Portland is very liberal and the white guilt factor is through the roof (I know, I live in Portland).  People will do anything here to show they are not racist.  </p>
<p>Example:  When Obama came to town on the campaign trail; it was the largest rally ever held during his campaign.  Even larger than the Chicago rallies. Portland is almost 80% white and about 6% black.  </p>
<p>Championing diversity is something everyone says they buy into here, but in reality it is very segregated.  All the blacks live in North Portland and all the whites live everywhere else.<br>

		<p>I guess the academics have realized the practical limmitations of cultivating those of primitive genetics and thus settled for a refined form of primitivism. The sad thing is the naive whites who mistake this as something they&rsquo;d like to dabble in.

<p>Sad to say I have seen this sort of thing to help kids learn things like multiplication and division. I worked with troubled youth at a boys school for a while and the teacher got this sort of thing for the two black kids that were enrolled there. BTW this was in Nevada County CA, one of the Whitest counties in northern CA. I think one of the boys was transferred to the Sacramento facility since he kept accusing staff of &#8220;racism&#8221; when he misbehaved or caused trouble. </p>

		<p>I think Schoolteacher has hit the nail on the head here; this is voluntary resegregation on the part of blacks, and this &#8220;hip hop&#8221; school will attract as its &#8220;students&#8221; precisely the teenagers who are the most disruptive of a genuine school.  This is simply a babysitting service to provide tax-funded daycare to people until they are 18 and old enough for prison.</p>

		<p>The whole point of this school is to find the lowest common denominator, and then declare success when Antwone and Darshida achieve it. </p>
<p>If you think having only 200 students means that it should be manageable, we&rsquo;re not talking 200 Mormons, here, but 200 typical lowlifes. </p>

<p>&#8220;The new school&rsquo;s director, Erica Jayasuriya, says its mission is to prepare students to be successful in society while engaging them through the recording arts that include hip-hop music, dance, spoken word and art&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
&hellip;because lord knows nobody&rsquo;s <i>ever</i> going to engage these &#8220;students&#8221; through mathematics, literature, philosophy, chemistry, or any other legitimate traditional (European) discipline that actually requires <i>brainpower</i>.  </p>

		<p>#8 ICE - I agree, if that worked, unfortunately, blacks are never happy around their own kind, rather, they flee to anywhere they can be around whites, where it&rsquo;s safe and all is free. They truly hate themselves and all think they are better than their own kind. If some states were independent and were &#8216;white only&rsquo; - even kicking out the mulattos, and whites who choose to &#8216;go black&rsquo; (- and no one wants them back -) whites would move there instantly.<br>

		<p>Do the &#8220;students&#8221; who graduate from this &#8220;school&#8221; expect to walk into a ghetto recording studio and get recording contracts right off the bat? If so, they&rsquo;re in for a surprise.</p>

		<p>A long fall from the glories of Benson High&rsquo;s outstanding music school magnet program.  When I resided in Portland I had the pleasure of hearing Benson&rsquo;s Jazz band performances on local radio.  Their swing orchestra had to be heard to be believed!</p>
<p>Now, a HIP HOP based curriculum?  Dear me&hellip;</p>
