<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In post-race America, life can get confusing. Fox News anchor Glenn Beck, of all people, calls President Barack Obama a racist. Teabaggers are contemplating whether they should mimmick Black Americans and embrace the term much like Blacks have embraced the N-word. And the below anti-health care ad is running in the largely black Washington D.C. media area. [See the ad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/FckugVHUQK4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" target="ad" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a>   &mdash;  AR News editor]</p>
<p>Racism, much like laundry detergents, is ripe for rebranding, repackaging, and re-entry into the mainstream. In fact, it works so well that Jared Taylor, the founder of the white supremacist website American Renaissance, was recently booked to debate immigration at a Midwestern college. The kids in charge of the speakers series invited an immigration lawyer to present the liberal stance and Taylor represent the conservative stance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly the greatest threat to whites today comes from immigration. Racial preferences, guilt-mongering, anti-Western education, even anti-white violence are manageable problems compared to a process that is displacing whites and reducing them to a minority,&#8221; said Taylor. &#8220;With a change in thinking at the right levels, anti-white policies and double standards could be done away with practically overnight, but that would still leave us with nearly 100 million non-whites living in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The college speaking tour was fairly recent. But it&rsquo;s not the first time Taylor, one of the most vocal advocates of white supremacy doctrine, has reared his head in the mainstream.</p>
<p>Under the guise of being a race relations expert, he was booked repeatedly on Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s birthday by radio host who were unaware what he really was. Early that morning, he started at a Columbus, Ohio radio station. Within two hours, he was at another radio station in Orlando. An hour later, he was Huntingdon, W.VA. Each time, he was introduced as a race relations expert. During each presentation, he never once called King the N-word, instead he repeated the notion that King was a philanderer, a plagiarist and a drinker, that King&rsquo;s legacy was racial division and resentment. And due to those reasons, he was not worthy of a national holiday.</p>
<p>Taylor, a Yale graduate, fluent in three languages, has no use for white sheets or para-military uniforms. He preaches racism through academia, pseudoscientific theories, genetic imprints and deliberately assassinating the character of any black person that ascends to greatness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not racism, it&rsquo;s racialism, get it. He is not anti-Black, Latino, Jew or Gay, but pro-white Christian Americans concerned &#8220;their country&#8221; is heading in the wrong direction, worried about the rampant importation of poverty and crime via Mexico and South America, bewildered by crime and the apparent lack of morality in urban communities.</p>
<p>These folks have even adopted the grievance dynamic that minorities are more typically blamed for. They, in recruiting, say they are under seige. They are in danger. Their lives, way of living, daughters, and property are all at risk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clever marketing and I fear will continue to be effective at needling its way into the dialogue of race, class and gender. His tactics are clearly already being mimmicked in the mainstream media and political discourse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who departs from racial orthodoxy will at some point have to contend with the charge of &#8220;racism.&#8221; &#8220;That&rsquo;s a racist statement,&#8221; your opponent will say, in a tone that suggests he has just dropped a nuclear bomb, and for timid people  &mdash;  about 95 percent of whites  &mdash;  that ends the argument,&#8221; Taylor wrote in teaching other racists how to argue eloquently and deflect the racist label. &#8220;(It) is actually an advantage for us, because the people who make it have probably never seen it fail. You therefore have an opportunity to shock them by walking away from ground zero without a scratch. If you are in a radio debate, or some other forum in which you need to save time, deflect the &#8220;racism&#8221; charge in a light-hearted way by saying, &#8220;Come on, say something original.&#8221; No one ever expects that reply, and during the surprised pause that follows you can make a positive rather than defensive argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always good to know what your enemies are up to.<br>

		<p>First I smell a &#8220;ghost&#8221; writer. And second whomever the author is, writes like someone would care that she views someone as a racist. devona, or whomever wrote this; I highly doubt if Mr Taylor cares that you see him as a racist. I for sure dont. (Playing the race card when you&rsquo;ve got nothing else, gets so old that it has lost its meaning.) And in fact I see you as a racist. And you probably care as much about my opinion as I do yours. </p>

		<p>Did anyone else noticed how the blogger never attempted to refute the actual substance of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s views, but instead resorted to name-calling, such as saying that he&rsquo;s a so-called white supremacist?</p>
<p>The blogger said that Jared Taylor &#8220;&hellip;[assassinates] the character of any black person that ascends to greatness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, this idiot doesn&rsquo;t see her hypocrisy. She smears Jared Taylor with ad hominem attacks, never bothering to debate the substance of his views, then goes on to say that he is a character assassin of black people. Of course, she doesn&rsquo;t provide any evidence that Jared Taylor is a character assassin of blacks, other than mentioning Taylor talking about the other side of Martin Luther King (all facts).</p>
<p>I almost want to get angry as this blogger. But I decided that is was more appropriate to laugh at her stupidity, because what some of these leftists say is so absurd that it&rsquo;s a joke.</p>

		<p>Some of the conservative ideas I&rsquo;ve been exposed to have come from books devoted to airing opposing viewpoints in the same volume. They say equal time favors already established opinions, but racial issues are so visceral they keep most everyone&rsquo;s attention. Of course here we don&rsquo;t get equal time. This lady doesn&rsquo;t want race to become an issue at all, or even spoken of, in the dialog on race, class and gender, at least not the white race.  <br>

		<p>If Jared Taylor is indeed wrong about anything, don&rsquo;t resort to personal attacks. Refute him. Are his stats wrong? If so how? I think that if everything AmRen produced was a vicious lie, someone somewhere would be able to prove it. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no bad advertising: Anytime the words &#8220;American Renaissance&#8221; and the name &#8220;Jared Taylor&#8221; appear in print, this site must get at least a few new readers.  Quoting Taylor only helps, because unlike his critics (such as this one) the man never says anything stupid.  </p>

		<p>Jared Taylor has had the courage to speak his views on racialism, which says a great deal that&rsquo;s good about his character right from the beginning.  He has supported authors whose works are so inflammatory to the mainstream that they never appear in that media.  I&rsquo;m referring to Phillippe Rushton&rsquo;s work  &#8220;Race, Evolution, and Behavior.&#8221;  I got the long version and read every word.  I also read the entire &#8220;Bell Curve&#8221;, which is a lot of reading.  These works and many others that do not support the lies of the mainstream media have been supported and made available by Mr. Taylor.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible for anyone who has been brainwashed by the leftists with regard to race to even begin to understand the racialist viewpoint, despite the fact that science and statistics are on our side.  I appreciate Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s courage and persistence in maintaining a rather high profile, given that there doubtless is a good deal of danger involved in it.  Bravo Mr. Taylor, and please keep up your fine work!</p>

		<p>I am sick of these minorities always lumping gays with blacks,metizo&rsquo;s,muslims etc.like they support gays,these people HATE white gays a 1000 times more than they do straight whites.  So please non-whites quit using me and other gays in your war against my family members and my fellow white man.  Most gay whites(except the liberal crackpots)don&rsquo;t like you either because of the insane pathological discrimination we have suffered at your hands.  I just was fired from my job because i filed a complaint after being openly threatened by two black thugs right to my face.  I filed a complaint with HR office only to be stabbed in the back by white manager and supervisors(all of them white)blacks can do anything they want on the job without fear of getting in trouble and they know it.</p>

		<p>It is funny how people like this writer never mention what some liberal politicians had to say about the sainted Martin Luther King.  Robert Caro&rsquo;s biography on LBJ states that the then President Johnson used to sit up in bed and read the FBI&rsquo;s reports on King&rsquo;s sexual exploits and get a big kick out of them.  According to Caro the shenanigans were taped by FBI agents while King was romping with white women in the five star hotels he was using during his many campaigns for his fellow blacks.  IN fact, Caro quotes LBJ as saying, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll have these &#8216;N  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  &rsquo; voting Democrat for the next 200 years.&#8221;  Of course we all know now that only white conservatives are racist while democrats and other leftists don&rsquo;t mutter such things.  <br>

<p>She probably is. These people have about the same mentality as those who tried to &#8216;keep blacks from voting&rsquo; in the deep south. Except these liberals don&rsquo;t want a single word spoken ever by whites talking about their experiences as whites, not just something positive, but not a single word at all. They&rsquo;d probably prefer we not even speak with each other.  </p>

This Devona Walker may be just a low-level no-name blogger, but I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s noticed Mr. Taylor and his org. And even thought Devona is hostile to them, I&rsquo;m <i>still</i> she&rsquo;s noticed AmRen. Because as other posters have said, <i>all</i> publicity is good publicity. </p>
<p>What AR needs more than anything at this point is merely to get <i>mentioned</i> in the media. Any media. It&rsquo;s all good   &mdash;   even when the writer&rsquo;s intent is bad. One of the great things about the Internet is that an item reported by an obscure blogger can be picked up by more major websites&hellip; and then sometimes even by the Dinosaur Media. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope this Devona starts some sort of chain reaction. We&rsquo;ve got three years to make Americans realize they made a huge mistake electing the Mulatto Messiah and convince them not to do it again. I&rsquo;d very much like to see Jared Taylor become a major media spokesperson, invited on as many shows as a Jesse Jackson or an Al Sharpton. Become the networks&rsquo; &#8220;go-to guy&#8221; for the white POV whenever a race-related national story (e.g. the Jena Six-on-One) happens to break. </p>
<p>At the moment, there are two reasons the Dino Media doesn&rsquo;t call Mr. Taylor: I&rsquo;d wager the vast majority of them   &mdash;   just like the vast majority of white Americans   &mdash;   have never heard of AR. There is a smaller group of media mavens who do know of them, but for whom AR&rsquo;s &#8220;racism&#8221; puts Mr. Taylor &#8220;beyond the pale&#8221; as a potential guest or source for soundbites, etc. </p>
<p>This latter group (which, sadly, seems to include the right-wing radio ranter Michael S.) can&rsquo;t be converted; they&rsquo;ve decided against us already. </p>
<p>But the former group   &mdash;   the masses of the uninitiated who&rsquo;ve never heard the words &#8220;American&#8221; and &#8220;Renaissance&#8221; said in sequence   &mdash;   are tremendous potential sources of free PR for AR. </p>
<p>And in the age of the WWW, a publicity snowball can sometimes be set in motion by something as seemingly inconsequential as a poorly written hate-note from a no-account blogger. Why, even by one with a silly name like &#8220;Devona&#8221;! </p>

<p>Re your situation, (post # 10), you might consider suing your ex-employer for wrongful termination, discrimination and even keeping and maintaining an unsafe workplace - especially regarding the two black thugs.</p>

<p>I would like to see AR expand to video and audio.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor should be doing his own weekly interviews which he can post on this website and on youtube (and others). He choses the guest. He controls the format and content. No censorship or filters from the mainstream media. Pure American Renaissance perspective and content.</p>
<p>If guests and topics were announced a week in advance, we could submit question for the guests as well. As sites such as twitter have proven, when people feel they are fully engaged in the topic, these types of sites explode with viewers.</p>
<p>While I suspect Mr. Taylor would like more people to read scholarly works on race, today, people are using the internet for video and audio.</p>
<p>The left is using this media to spread their message but AR isn&rsquo;t even in the mix.</p>
<p>AR should bypass the media censors and embrace the power of the internet. Fight fire with fire.<br>

		<p>10 Homo   &mdash;   I know that, in big cities, which, to put it sensitively, people of an alternate orientation tend to prefer, the most acute danger in their daily lives is black crime.  As a matter of fact, in many black-on-white homosexual crimes, anti-h/s slurs are used, so it appears to be an anti-gay hate crime, and there will be candles lit and SPLC confabs conducted as if they were, but I think they are really anti-white hate crimes, misunderstood.</p>
<p>There was such a crime several weeks back at a gay bar in a heavily black St. Louis neighborhood that has several pockets of young whites, split evenly between hetero and homo.  The media told us that the perps used anti-gay slurs in the process of their assault against three gay men leaving the bar at about 1 am, and gave us a physical description of the suspects (who are still unapprehended), but left out one thing:  The race of the perps.  I deduce from that that the doers were black, and that race was the real motivation.  But that hasn&rsquo;t precluded St. Louis&rsquo;s Mayor, the ADL, the local chapter of GLAAD, etc. from protesting against &#8220;anti-gay hate.&#8221;  Though a local blogger did write that he is glad that the ADL is involved, just in case the doers are black &#8220;and the white racists want to pick off the gays.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agree with you, however, there are different types of propaganda involved in the field of psychological warfare (psyops). One of the techniques, not the preferred one, I don&rsquo;t think, is called &#8216;inoculation&rsquo;. Introduce the target audience, in a safe environment, to just a portion of the enemies rhetoric and they become &#8216;inoculated&rsquo; against it, is the theory. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on here with her blog, but sometimes when I read these accounts I suspect that&rsquo;s what is going on. Still some publicity is better than none. </p>

<p>Homo,<br>
I agree with you 100%. <br>
I work in education with several Gay colleagues who although great guys and excellent teachers who are naueatingly liberal when it comes to Blacks and Muslims.  I can&rsquo;t seem to make them understand that if these people become a predominant force in this country, they will be some of the first to be liquidated. I&rsquo;ll never understand why so many gays seem to want to identify with people who would exterminate them without a second thought.<br>
I&rsquo;ve often contended that Blacks are attracted to Islam because it condones Mysogeny, hatred for Homosexuals and any other intolerance so long as it is perpetrated in the name of Allah and his prophet Muhammed.<br>

My greatest concern, however, is that no matter how illogical and unfounded the arguments of &#8220;educated&#8221; non-whites and self-hating liberal whites, debate is an invention of the West, and only truly effective with our people, and even there only to a limited percentage of the population of whites.</p>
<p>Our overriding success in the conquest of non-white lands wasn&rsquo;t so much due to our intellectual superiority, rather, in the ability to effectively implement ideas coupled with brute physical force. An overview of the Western History proves the point that intellectual superiority is only as effective as its ability to apply brute physical force when necessary.</p>
<p>Debating with a non-white or a white race traitor is as effective in the long run as trying to sink the Queen Elizabeth with a rock. Regardless of the sorry state of our nation due to race traitors on both sides of the so-called political fence, and culminating in the empty-suit we call Mr. Obama, deluded whites will continue to be afraid of the term &#8220;racist,&#8221; white women and men will continue destroying the product of generations of racial preservation through their intermingling with non-white men and women, and self-segregated whitopians will continue to extol the virtues of diversity.</p>
<p>I used to look on these types of whites as necessary evils, that it was about numbers, but History has also proven that the victories of brave and courageous men have almost always and exclusively occurred when we did NOT have a numerical advantage.</p>
<p>Instead of saying &#8220;God help us all&#8221; (with all due respect to John PM), let&rsquo;s start thinking that &#8220;God helps those who help themselves.&#8221; </p>

I wrote the &#8220;The Loop&#8221; reporter, who supposedly wrote this piece, though it sounds above her ability, quite frankly.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure she&rsquo;s had help.  My August email to her was in response to a story, allegedly by her, prompting advertisers to drop Glenn Beck&rsquo;s show. </p>
<p>I told her that black people should thank whites for helping them via affirmative action and billions of dollars in social benefits, not demonize them. I don&rsquo;t know why she mentioned &#8220;European history,&#8221; (below) because I said nothing regarding that. I think she&rsquo;s so full of hate for white people she&rsquo;s unhinged, plus she&rsquo;s not overly bright either.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s her response to me.  I also posted it throughout the Patriot Network which goes to hundreds of thousands of people.  I&rsquo;m slowly educating them by submitting examples like this of black hate, something the majority of Patriot whites are unaware of. </p>
<p>Note her mention of &#8220;racism&#8221; in the above story, yet she displays an anti-white, racist mindset that is absolutely amazing.</p>

&#8220;You are nuts. We&rsquo;re not talking about European History, we are talking about right now. And there are plenty of dysfunctional, likely inbred, completely and absolutely backwards white people just like you. That is why you are threatened by every other race. You realize your period of supremacy on this Earth has come to an end. You are now a minority class, just a bunch of loud, dying people who spend your entire lives either emulating of hating people of color. Sending me racism, veiled as intellectual discourse, will not change that.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can keep spewing that affirmative action excuse as long as you want. Maybe someday you will choke on it. BTW, you&rsquo;ve been blocked B**CH!&#8221;  (She spelled this out.  The asterisks are mine.)<br>
End of quote&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Such racist tripe among a large percentage of black people, unfortunately, is very common, but never mentioned by the MSM.</p>
<p>Such hate is really extraordinary.</p>
<p>I wrote her back a blasting commentary, but it was blocked.  I notice she isn&rsquo;t listing her email address with her stories anymore.</p>

<p>One thing about her hate e-mail jumped right out at me:  Sent at 2:41 AM.  What&rsquo;s she doing up at that time of night?  I would presume her work is normal day hours.  But even if it&rsquo;s after a Friday night of partying (The day of week it was sent was Saturday), why is she doing her job at that time?  It just might be little ole bigoted me, but if I&rsquo;m getting into my house at twenty of three in the morning after a Friday night, work is/should be the last thing on my mind.  If you catch my drift.  (Either way, I&rsquo;d be drunk, tired or both, and therefore not thinking about work.)</p>

		<p>The Walker email is illuminating and depressingly typical of blacks. Nowhere in that disheveled, illiterate screed is there the remotest semblance of argument; it&rsquo;s nothing but racial animus.  Calling<br>
someone &#8220;dysfunctional,&#8221; &#8220;inbred,&#8221; &#8220;loud,&#8221; &#8220;backwards&#8221; and the rest does nothing even to address the rudiments of his argument. The mere fact that someone like this is paid to express her witless opinions in print tells you a great deal about contemporary American culture.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s your point, QD?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re pointing out that her atrocious self-expression (For somebody who claims to be a reporter.) was likely due to being drunk or tired, let me just mention that I had numerous email exchanges with her before she finally cracked on the last one and they were written at various hours of the day and were written just as poorly.</p>
<p>And, I doubt that she would consider it work to get on the computer and rap with her homies, so she probably checks her email at all hours of the day.  They absolutely LOVE cell phones and computers, especially the photos.</p>
<p>And by drifting off-subject as to her physical condition aren&rsquo;t we forgetting the anti-white hatred she displays, which is really the crux of the matter and reveals her hypocricy in the story above that is calling us all racists?</p>

		<p>21 SPQA: You&rsquo;re on to something.  Discourse with non-Whites on racial issues is generally pointless, unless there are uninformed Whites listening in.  The real object is to let White observers see how the non-Whites think, and what they think of us.  Many of these Whites will take the non-White&rsquo;s side, but the thinking ones will get a lesson in diversity as it really is.  They are debater&rsquo;s real audience.  </p>

		<p>Remember, whenever Brownies band together to advocate for their own special interests, this is perfectly acceptable, and is, indeed, encouraged by &#8220;our&#8221; government.</p>
<p>But  anytime Whites attempt to speak up, much less band together, to remind others that Causasians invented western civilization, or even to protect themselves from carjacking, home invasion, smash &amp; grab (don&rsquo;t let anyone ever tell you that Blacks haven&rsquo;t invented anything)&hellip;somehow these efforts are automatically labeled as &#8220;white supremacy.&#8221;</p>

-You really just need to laugh in the face of people like this.<br>

		<p>Any mention of American Renaissance is good for us.  When I was dragged to the &#8220;Museum of Tolerance&#8221; in Los Angeles, I made a point of writing down all the &#8220;hate&#8221; websites listed in one display.  Unfortunately, they were all fake or out of date or something.  The tolerance people weren&rsquo;t taking any chances.  </p>

		<p>Devona Walker examine the fallacy of ad hominem to comprehend how irrelevant and worthless your two cents came out in your article. Are you lying about what you think Mr. Taylor believes? We believe in freedom of association not white supremacy. In fact, it&rsquo;s our earnest wish to be nowhere near Blacks. So how can we be &#8220;supreme&#8221; over people we desire to be nowhere near? You&rsquo;re the apostle of coercion with your belief in forced diversity.</p>

		<p>  &#8220;I am sick of these minorities always lumping gays with blacks,metizo&rsquo;s,muslims etc., like they support gays.  These people HATE white gays a 1000 times more than they do straight whites. So please non-whites, quit using me and other gays in your war against my family members and my fellow whites.&#8221; Hmong</p>
<p>Hmongamongyou:   I understand what you mean, and you are right.  Blacks always go for the most vunerable, the easiest victim, the littlest schoolkid, whatever. That&rsquo;s why they mug frail old ladies, not husky young men. And preferably three against one. And that&rsquo;s why they abuse gays. They&rsquo;re certainly not going to look for somebody who&rsquo;ll give them more trouble than they bargained for. And as a small minority, you make a handy victim. You&rsquo;re more a minority than they are, and they LOVE that! They love to catch a white person who&rsquo;s vulnerable. It&rsquo;s open season on you.</p>
<p>Robert Kelly: That appalling reply you received from &#8220;Devona&#8221; says all that needs to be said about her brainpower. Aside from personal abuse like calling you &#8220;inbred&#8221; and &#8220;Bit*h&#8221;, she had absolutely no argument against you. There wasn&rsquo;t so much as a shred of logic (or even decency) in it. Typical of a Fourth Grader. If someone like her were deprived of insults, she&rsquo;d be left speechless. So much for debate with blacks!  They can&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>It is time that whites make the word &#8220;racist&#8221; a badge of honor and proudly proclaim it to all with eyes to see and ears to hear.  </p>
<p>Being a racist is neither immoral nor illegal and anyone of any race who claims they are not a racist is lying to themselves and everyone else.  </p>
