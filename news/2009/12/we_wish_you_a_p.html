<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Earlier this season, countless schools and households celebrated Kwanzaa. They lit black, red and green candles (for black skin, red blood, and the green hills of Africa), and sang songs about the festival&rsquo;s &#8220;seven principles,&#8221; such as faith, unity and creativity. Already big among blacks in the United States, Kwanzaa is catching on in Canada, too. Held each year from December 26 until January 2, Kwanzaa is increasingly seen as an appropriate multicultural alternative to Christmas, a holiday considered too religious and &#8220;Eurocentric&#8221; for public schools. But there is one not-so-insignificant problem with Kwanzaa. While many teachers believe it is an ancient African harvest festival, it was not born in pre-colonial West Africa, but in 1960s southern California. It is the brainchild of African-American radical activist, academic and convicted felon Ron Karenga.</p>
<p>In 1969, two rival radical groups were battling for control of the UCLA black studies program: the Black Panthers and the lesser-known US, or United Slaves, led by Mr. Karenga. Both groups sauntered around campus carrying loaded guns. Perhaps inevitably, violence erupted. As David Horowitz recalls in <cite>Radical Son,</cite> Black Panther John Higgins was &#8220;murdered  &mdash;  along with Al &#8216;Bunchy&rsquo; Carter  &mdash;  on the UCLA campus by members of Ron Karenga&rsquo;s organization.&#8221; After the killing, the FBI infiltrated both groups, and the United Slaves turned to fighting &#8220;enemies within.&#8221; The result: two female members were tortured by their &#8220;comrades&#8221; in May, 1970. Both alledge Mr. Karenga ordered and participated in their assaults.</p>
<p>In 1999, writer Paul Mulshine published his research into Karenga&rsquo;s violent past on FrontPageMagazine. Mr. Mulshine found a May 14, 1971, <cite>Los Angeles Times</cite> report of the victims&rsquo; testimony, which read: &#8220;The victims said they were living at Karenga&rsquo;s home when Karenga accused them of trying to [poison] him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When they denied it, allegedly they were beaten with an electrical cord and a hot soldering iron was put in [one victim&rsquo;s] mouth and against her face. Police were told that one of [the other victim&rsquo;s] toes was placed in a small vise which was allegedly tightened by one of the defendants. The following day .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Karenga, holding a gun, threatened to shoot both of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Convicted of felonious assault and false imprisonment, Mr. Karenga was sentenced in 1971 to up to 10 years in prison. &#8220;A brief account of the sentencing ran in several newspapers the following day,&#8221; Mr. Mulshine writes. &#8220;That was apparently the last newspaper article to mention Karenga&rsquo;s unfortunate habit of doing unspeakable things to black people. After that, the only coverage came from the hundreds of news accounts that depict him as the wonderful man who invented Kwanzaa.&#8221; Shortly after his release from prison in 1975, Mr. Karenga (now armed, not with a pistol, but a doctorate) took over the black studies department at California State University, Long Beach, which he runs to this day.</p>
<p>And what about Kwanzaa? The festival&rsquo;s seven days commemorate allegedly &#8220;traditional African&#8221; principles, such as &#8220;collective work&#8221; and &#8220;cooperative economics,&#8221; each referred to by a Swahili name. &#8220;Why did Karenga use Swahili words for his fictional African feast?&#8221; asks Mr. Mulshine. &#8220;American Blacks are primarily descended from people who came from Ghana and other parts of West Africa. Kenya and Tanzania  &mdash;  where Swahili is spoken  &mdash;  are thousands of miles away. This makes about as much sense as having Irish-Americans celebrate St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day by speaking Polish.&#8221; And why would Mr. Karenga schedule a harvest festival near the winter solstice, &#8220;a season when few fruits or vegetables are harvested anywhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>This month, the religious satire magazine <cite>The Door</cite> likewise questioned Kwanzaa&rsquo;s authenticity. &#8220;Karenga cobbled together a mishmash of different traditions and languages and blended them with Marxist ideas to reflect a unified African culture that doesn&rsquo;t exist anywhere,&#8221; it reported. Ujamaa, or &#8220;cooperative economics&#8221;  &mdash;  one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa  &mdash;  is the term the socialist leader of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, used for his disastrous policy of putting tens of thousands of Tanzanians on collective farms.</p>
<p>&#8220;People think it&rsquo;s African, but it&rsquo;s not,&#8221; admitted Karenga in a 1978 <cite>Washington Post</cite> interview. &#8220;I put it around Christmas because I knew that&rsquo;s when a lot of &#8216;bloods&rsquo; [Blacks] would be partying.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Here is the thing about Kwanzaa.  It used to be that the media covered up these facts about what Kwanzaa is and where it originated.</p>
<p>However, these days, that knowledge is widespread and easily available.  Almost everyone has access to the internet and anyone with a mind to can google &#8220;Kwanzaa&#8221; and find out all these undisputed facts about it.  Major news pundits talk about it.  Major news magazines and newspapers carry articles about it.</p>
<p>Yet, few people openly ridicule Kwanzaa and speak openly about it, even though almost no black people care about Kwanzaa in any capacity whatsoever.  Worse, many liberals either think Kwanzaa is a legitimate black version of Christmas or are willing to pretend it is, despite knowing the truth.</p>
<p>This is far more than simple ignorance.  It&rsquo;s denial bordering on race treason.  Significant effort is put forth to maintain the lie even though knowledge that it IS a lie is widespread.</p>
<p>Considering the sinister motivation for the creation of Kwanzaa, what is behind this is equally sinister.  Whites and jews who maintain Kwanzaa (because no blacks maintain it, lol) do so not because of a love of african american culture but because of a hatred (a VIRULENT hatred) of white culture.</p>
<p>Everyone else keeps their mouth shut out of fear.  Very real fear of being targeted for physical violence, economic retaliation, even legal retaliation by the above culprits.</p>

		<p>Kwanzaa, Schmanzaa!  I get ticked off every time I see ABC Channel 7 put up a &#8220;Happy Kwanzaa&#8221; banner   &mdash;   but they did NOT put up a &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; banner.  I can&rsquo;t remember if they put on a &#8220;Happy Hanukkah&#8221; banner.  Kwanzaa and ebonics are both total nonsense; ebonics seems to have died a well-deserved death, but this Kwanzaa garbage is still here as an attempt by lower class blacks to give themselves some self-respect.  Maybe if they got an education and a decent job, it might obviate the need for Kwanzaa&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I notice that the Fox News Network wished all its followers a &#8220;Happy Kwanza.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on top right now, and appear to be turning a bit politically correct to attract even more viewers.  This is the point where an organization begins to go down hill by alienation their base in a feeble, unintelligent attempt to get more viewers, usually involving peiple who wouldn&rsquo;t give a moment&rsquo;s consideration to watching their programming.</p>

		<p>I got a Best Buy store circular about 2 weeks ago.  It had big &#8220;Happy Kwanza&#8221; decoration on the top.  No Xmas, no other holiday, just kwanza.  I wondered about that.</p>
<p>Two of the kwanza days are named after Arabic names from the Islamic religion.  Umoja, or unity, is from the Arabic words for community and gathering, and the imani word is arabic for &#8220;faith&#8221; or belief in God.  Swahili has a huge arabic vocab., a fact that probably is not known to these black studies types.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the question, what exactly is &#8220;black studies&#8221;?  I mean, is there math, science, cooking or anything there besides a marxist blend of african feel-goodisms and tragic &#8220;history&#8221;?</p>

<p>Right, the Swahili as used in the &#8220;Kwanzaa&#8221; celebration is from east Africa, the Swahili coast. Better called the SLAVE coast. Swahili is a hodge-podge of African languages and Arabic and Persian, and the persons identifying themselves as Swahili are coastal dwelling blacks with Arabic and Persian admixture identifying with the Arabic and Persian cultures, very distinct from inland Bantu.</p>
<p>Trifling and unimportant facts to the persons who are trying to find a &#8220;TRUE&#8221; African culture and lifestyle.</p>

		<p>A humorous and telling anecdote. On the day after Christmas, which is evidently the first day of &#8220;Kwanzaa,&#8221; all of the major &#8220;big 3&#8221; media outlets(ABC,NBC,CBS)in the NY/NJ area actually aired their Kwanzaa kick-off story from the exact same location, with the same people, and as far as I could see even the very same footage!! In other words, these three competing, major mainstream networks could apparently find only ONE location that even bothered with this silly black &#8220;holiday&#8221; enough to even warrant a half-hearted, cobbed together story. And all that amounted to was some African &#8220;dance&#8221; and a brief segment of drivel about the background of Kwanzaa. It looked for all the world like these networks got together and sent one token reporter to some &#8220;Afro cultural center&#8221; for a pre-arranged bit&hellip;and that was the end of it. They couldn&rsquo;t even dredge up ONE black family that observes this phony nonsense!</p>
<p>Other than a three second mention of it in the next day or two following, I never heard or saw more on any station. Wow! What a spectacular &#8220;holiday!!&#8221; </p>

		<p>Kwanzaa, like Afrocentric &#8220;history&#8221; and the African tap-water AIDS cure, has become one more thing by which non-blacks make fun of blacks.  As others on this site have stated, few black people celebrate the faux holiday.  It has become a clandestine joke which can be openly flaunted because some PC institutions  continue to have Kwanzaa displays.  The post office has Kwanzaa stamps, and the greeting card companies distribute appropo wares.  I once sent a Kwanzaa card, with a Kwanzaa stamp, to a (let us say) very racially conscious white co-worker.</p>

		<p>This article jolted me! I realized that I have not seen one TV story, one newspaper ad, or one radio story about Kwanzaa this year. No Kwanzaa banners on my home page! And I live in the People&rsquo;s Demokratik Republik of Kalifornia! In the Bay Area, no less! I just looked through today&rsquo;s newspaper, and didn&rsquo;t see it mentioned <i>once!</i> Admittedly I scanned it, but since I was expecting to see the word it should have jumped out at me. </p>
<p>Anyone else notice this?</p>

<p>What  you say  about Swahili  can  be said evn  a fortiori  about  any  European  language.  After all,  abstract  ideas and  concepts  entered  all  modern  European  languages  by  way  of  Greek and  Latin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you don&rsquo;t seem to  know  that  Semitic  the  parent  group  from which  Arabic  derives has  its  roots  in Esat  Africa.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that about the only blacks that really take in Kwanzaa anymore, at least in St. Louis, are the true die-hard militants.  Other than that, there&rsquo;s nothing about Kwanzaa.  Like I have said here before within the last month, I think the reason is that blacks thought than a 8 day holiday meant 8 whole days worth of gifts, or as another poster said, 8 days off work.  When it didn&rsquo;t work out that way, they dropped Kwanzaa.  Remember, when it comes to blacks, it&rsquo;s all about the consideration.</p>

		<p>WHAT black culture, #10?  Is there such a thing?  I&rsquo;ve been on this planet for 64+ years and I have NEVER seen any indication of &#8220;black CULTURE.&#8221;  I&rsquo;ve seen blacks banding together to riot and destroy their own areas here in SoCA twice; I&rsquo;ve seen blacks in groups attacking browns and whites fewer in number than the black group; I&rsquo;ve seen 6 year old black kids call each other the N word based on how light or dark they are; I&rsquo;ve heard black mothers on welfare say to one another, &#8220;It&rsquo;s about time to have another baby - the welfare&rsquo;s about to run out.&#8221;  This is CULTURE?  I call it &#8220;adapting to present conditions using the very least effort and intelligence available.&#8221;  Oh, and let us not forget the affirmative action &#8220;educated&#8221; blacks out there organizing the black ghettos so that they will demand more than their share of welfare, and any other money they can get their hands on - AND, last but not least, the legion of black preachers out there teaching &#8220;Hate Whitey and the United States of America.&#8221;  .</p>

		<p>Why is it that from Dec 26th on it is okay to be wished a Happy New Year in store&rsquo;s and resturant&rsquo;s? But from Dec 1st to 25th it is Happy Holiday&rsquo;s all the time everytime. I was told that the term Happy Holiday means all of the so called holiday&rsquo;s. It is now my practice to reply &#8220;It is not my New Year&#8221;, this causes more bewildered looks than you can imagine. Of course this is all done to make a point. That point being Dec 25th is a holiday for more people than Jan 1st is, yet it is forbidden in most public place&rsquo;s to mention what day Dec 25th is, but not Jan 1st. Happy Western New Year to all.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What you say about Swahili can be said even a fortiori about any European language&#8221;</p>
<p>What you say is true but the intent is nonetheless in the minds of such persons as Karenga to represent &#8220;Kwanzaa&#8221; as AUTHENTIC AFRICAN devoid of anything introduced when it is anything but.</p>
<p>And with the Swahili it is not merely language but culture too.</p>
<p>In the minds of those celebrating &#8220;Kwanzaa&#8221; the &#8220;holiday&#8221; is a substitute, a legitimate answer to the Christian holiday of Christmas that was &#8220;foisted&#8221; upon them by the evil whitey slave trader.</p>
<p>If Ron had chosen something say from the culture of the Dogon peoples he would have been more on the mark, but he did not! He himself did not seem to understand or appreciate the INTRODUCED aspects, very Islamic in nature, of the Swahili &#8220;lifestyle&#8221;. </p>

		<p>The  above  posters  don&rsquo;t seem  to  know  that  all  human  rituals, religions  and  other   cultural  artifacts  are  artificial  creations.  This  holds  for diverse  religions such  as the  3  major monothesitic  religions,  Buddhism,  Hinduism, Sikhism, etc.  </p>
<p>One  should  note too  that most religions  and  other  cultural  artifacts could  spread  far  and  wide from their  original  starting  points, or they  may be  created  whole  cloth  out  of  cultural  artifacts  origined in distant  places.  Think  of the  many  variants  of  Christianity  &mdash;  all  created  in the  West  but  founded  on  ancient  West Asian  cultural and  ritual  practices.</p>
<p>So, in actual  fact, there&rsquo;s  nothing  out  of the  ordinary  about  Kwanzaa.</p>

		<p>Jedderman,</p>
<p>Kwanzaa is  &#8220;authentically  African&#8221;  &mdash;  if  that  indeed  is  how  Karenga described it  &mdash;  in much  the same that the  Lutheran or  Methodist  variants  of  Christianity  are  authentically  Western or  European.  But  it  is  known that  Christianity  has  its  roots  in West  Asia.  Similarly, adherents to  Islam,  Sikhism and  East  Asian  Buddhism also  claim  authenticity  for their  religions and  accompanying  rituals,  but it  is well  known  that  such derive  from  cultural  diffusion  from other  culture  centers.</p>

<p>You say  that  if  Karenga  had  chosen  some  artifact from  the  Dogon culture he  would have  been  more authentic.  Well,  there  is  some  controversy  about  Dogon  culture  given  that  it  contains knowledge of  astronomy(knowledge of the  path  Sirius, for example) that some  skeptics question as  to its  assumed indigenous origins </p>
<p>Furthermore, the  fact  that  European  chose a  distant  West  Asian  religion  on which  to  base  their  rituals instead  of  developing  their  local  traditions that have  been  unearthed by  archeologica  research  &mdash;  Stonehenge rituals, for example  &mdash;  does  not  make  European  Christianty  less  authentic.<br>

		<p>This is the first year in about a decade that I do not recall any idiotic promotion or mention of kwanzaa by the gullible local media. Now that it is supposed to be over that really surprises me. </p>
<p>Of course, my nieces who unfortunately attend a junior high with a large black enrollment are forced to sing some idiotic kwanzaa tune at their &#8216;winter&rsquo; choir concert. So the public schools are stilling hanging on to it. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not an accurate comparison, as usual, but, personally, I&rsquo;m all for anything blacks want&hellip;and I will support their efforts in pursuing whatever they want&hellip;.so long as it keeps them separate from us.</p>
<p>Enjoy your Kwanza.  I&rsquo;m glad you have it, and the more division blacks create between whites and blacks the better the majority of whites in this country are going to like it.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, whites have to take care of blacks like they would mentally challenged children, and we&rsquo;re sick of it.  Get your own institutions, concepts, religions, schools, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for giving up a couple of states as well or $50,000 each to relocate to the old country or Haiti.</p>

<p>No. They know that not all human rituals were devised by a dude named Ron in the 1970s with a phony mail order degree who had just served time for beating up women. </p>

<p>What you say about Swahili can be said evn a fortiori about any European language. After all, abstract ideas and concepts entered all modern European languages by way of Greek and Latin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Complete nonsense, of the kind we have come to expect from you, &#8220;OCCAM&#8221;.  Gott, Ehre, Geist - german for God, Honor, and Spirit respectively - all fairly abstract concepts.  I&rsquo;m sure it is no different for slavic and celtic languages.</p>

<p>I know! There were some blacks on a Tyra Banks show that were whining about their employer wanting them to get rid of their dreadlocks.  Okay, so blacks whine and sue us if we don&rsquo;t hire them, then once we let them in they complain that they don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with us and our expectations.  They think they are entitled to success and to be a part of white society without having to blend in and act like civilized, professional, hardworking people.</p>

		<p>RE: OCCAM</p>
<p>Certainly this is not the same Occam that produced the theoretical razor. </p>
<p>I guess this is the pablum one expects on the &#8216;internets&rsquo; and in our educational institutions.</p>
<p>First of all, the three monotheistic religions are not Buddhism, Hinduism nor Sikhism. Where this young person gathered these facts is beyond me. I am assuming they achieved a C- in World Religions, with grade inflation.</p>
<p>Second, OCCAM seems to think that there is a development from African idiocy, to Greco-Roman reason, which then magically migrates back to African thought. Please explain this magical transformation for me! <br>
As is evident in the visual and artistic record, black african slaves were the norm from the Egyptian dynasties to the contemporary period. Blacks who dissent from this are deluding themselves. GO TO THE MET Museum in Manhattan! LOOK AT THE HISTORICAL RECORD! WHITE, BLONDE and RED-HAIRED, BLUE EYED EGYPTIANS RULED THE BLACKS!</p>
<p>I love Africa! May it continue its magestic rise for centuries to come!</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Africa</p>
