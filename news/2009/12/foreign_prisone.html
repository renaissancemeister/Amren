			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Whitehead, Telegraph (London), Dec. 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 2,000 foreign prisoners have been handed the money in the last two years in a desperate bid to clear Britain&rsquo;s overcrowded jails. </p>
<p>Some prisoners are given the money even though they are also freed from their jail terms up to nine months early. </p>
<p>They can spend it on anything they wish once they have returned home and is part of a package worth up to £5,000 each. </p>
<p>It means the taxpayer has funded more than £1 million alone just to give overseas criminals who have preyed on Britons cash in their hand. </p>
<p>One of those was a Malaysian migrant who killed a 17-month-old baby. </p>
<p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow Justice Secretary, said: &#8220;This is simply outrageous. It is bad enough that Gordon Brown lost control of our borders and has let thousands of foreign criminals into the country. </p>
<p>&#8220;Now we learn that foreign prisoners are being given cash cards loaded with hundreds of pounds of taxpayers&rsquo; money. The lesson is clear: under Labour, crime pays and the taxpayer foots the bill.&#8221; </p>
<p>The cash cards are part of the so-called Facilitated Returns Scheme which was launched in October 2006 and encourages overseas offenders to return to their home country once they have passed the point they would be released if British. </p>
<p>It is aimed at preventing lengthy and expensive legal battles against deportation and can see inmates given resettlement packages worth up to £5,000, with most coming in the form of &#8220;in kind&#8221; support. </p>
<p>One in four of the foreign criminals who was deported last year only went home after being offered a voluntary return package  &mdash;  a 60 per cent increase in such agreements in one year. </p>
<p>In total 2,200 prisoners have taken advantage on the last two years meaning £1.1 million of public money has been spent just on providing cash cards to encourage offenders who have no right to be in Britain to leave, including £1.1 million in cash. </p>
<p>The overall bill, including the full packages, runs to several million pounds. </p>
<p>Under a separate early removal scheme, foreign prisoners can be freed up to 270 days in advance of their release date so long as they are willing to return home and can still take up the returns packages. </p>
<p>The cash element was quietly introduced by the Home Office in October. </p>
<p>The cards can be used as Visa chip and pin meaning the prisoners could feasibly even buy duty free on the plane home. </p>
<p>However, a Home Office spokesman insisted most deportees are returned on charter flights where such services do not exist. </p>
<p>&#8220;Every day that we can get these individuals out of the country early saves taxpayers over £100 a night in detention costs. Last year we removed a record 5,400 foreign national prisoners.&#8221; </p>
<p>Matthew Elliott, chief executive at the TaxPayers&rsquo; Alliance, said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a disgrace that we bribe foreign criminals to go home at all, they should be deported immediately. The fact that we also give them a hefty cash bonus to spend as they wish will rightly anger the law-abiding taxpayers who are footing the bill for this hare-brained scheme. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Government&rsquo;s attitude to foreign criminals has been far too much carrot and not nearly enough stick, and this sort of treatment is financially and morally unjustifiable at a time when ordinary people are struggling to make ends meet.&#8221; </p>
<p>There are just under 12,000 foreign prisoners in jails in England and Wales, making up one in seven of the population behind bars. </p>
<p>One of those to have taken up the returns package is Malaysian Agnes Wong, 29, who was jailed for five years in 2008 for the manslaughter of toddler Hugo Wang she was supposed to be child-minding. </p>
<p>She was released in July this year, having served the minimum jail term of two-and-half years, including her time spent on remand, and put on a plane home with returns package worth £4,500. </p>
<p>Phil Woolas, the Border and Immigration minister, said: &#8220;Our Facilitated Returns Scheme saves the taxpayer money because foreign criminals are removed direct from jail or immigration detention, often before their sentence ends. </p>
<p>&#8220;This means foreign lawbreakers cannot drag out the removal process for months with frivolous appeals which clog up the legal system.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Okay, so maybe this practice sounds rather dubious. The problem begins with violent illegals given the right to waste tons of public funds waging costly appeals of their deportations. That alone is a huge problem because it leads leftists to argue that this resettlement package is more economical and saves taxpayers a bundle. The system reinforces itself! It&rsquo;s a bit like spending exorbitant amounts of money on America&rsquo;s worst violent prisoners (when those prisoners should actually be glad for anything they get), then arguing that it&rsquo;s cheaper to release some of them early, thus &#8220;relieving the burden&#8221; to taxpayers. BUT&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;if you would consider Mikael Widmark&rsquo;s article on AmRen (/ar/2005/12/index.html#cover), recall that many legal Somali Immigrants in Denmark left voluntarily in response to the social openness about discussing how problematic their community is. These same rejects, rather than returning home, simply spread out around Europe and become a curse to whomever takes them. With this &#8220;resettlement package&#8221;, at least there is hope that such persons will return to their own native environments instead of polluting someone else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But, then again, it&rsquo;s just that: hope. How is the British government sure that such persons will remain in their own nations once deported?</p>

  If Lewis Carroll were sitting down today to write &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; he&rsquo;d throw his hands up in despair and say &#8220;I can&rsquo;t compete with the British Government.<br>
   Sadly, while Carroll wrote a fabulous fantasy that has`charmed millions of children, the British(?) government are deliberately destroying a once wonderful country.May they rot in hell.</p>

		<p>In terms of &#8216;carrot or the stick diplomacy&rsquo;, this is obviousily &#8216;the carrot&rsquo;.<br>
Makes me wonder if there still &#8216;a stick&rsquo; in the modern P.C. U.K. at all?</p>

		<p>&hellip;Meanwhile, Nick Griffin could be seen laughing all the way to the voting booth.</p>
<p>This is what almost every daily mail article should end with.  If it wasn&rsquo;t for the occasional obligatory &#8216;bash the bnp&rsquo; article the Daily Mail puts up, you&rsquo;d almost think that they supported them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit miffed that I won&rsquo;t be able to go to the 2010 AR conference to see Nick and Craig Bodeker speak.</p>

		<p>He broke the laws of the day.  Why should he be pardoned almost 100 years later?  Why don&rsquo;t we go ahead and pardon Al Capone simply because it&rsquo;s legal to consume and sell alcohol today?  This is why I&rsquo;m not voting for Republicans anymore. I&rsquo;m really sick of pandering to blacks and illegal immigrants.   </p>

		<p>Every single totalitarian system has been sick, insane and a plague on the people under its control.</p>
<p>Why should the british system be any different?  Why should the US?</p>
<p>The solution is not to be found with arguing over what is to be done, pandering to various special interest groups or even voting for various parties.</p>
<p>The SOLUTION is to severely disempower, defund or even dissolve these federal systems and return rights and responsibilities (and most importantly&hellip;.resources) to the local level.</p>
<p>Then people will make decisions based on enlightened self interest and direct accountability on the local level.</p>
<p>The problem is not that the state is tyrannical.  ALL states are tyrannical.  Some are slightly better than others.  But all of them are bad.</p>
<p>What we need are communities, not states.  Basically, everything the fascists, communists and other jerks have tried to destroy or minimize&hellip;..race, family, community, religion, RELATIONSHIPS, need to be emphasized.</p>
<p>Rebuild those relationships and destroy the state.  That&rsquo;s the solution.</p>
<p>This is especially true of immigration.  Close knit communities are naturally highly resistant to infiltration, dilution and destruction via ethnic invasion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our lack of community that is the real problem.  It has created a niche for hostile third world invaders to enter and destroy us from within.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a symptom, not the cause.</p>
