<h1>Pres. Obama&rsquo;s Aunt Anguished by Family Separation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rodrique Ngowi, San Francisco Examiner, December 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama&rsquo;s aunt buried her face in her hands and sobbed as she described her anguish over no longer having contact with him and his family after the revelation she had been living illegally for years in the United States in public housing.</p>
<p>Zeituni Onyango (zay-TUH&rsquo;-nee awn-YAHN&rsquo;-goh) told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that she is troubled that her immigration woes have made her a political liability to her nephew.</p>
<p>Onyango, the half sister of Obama&rsquo;s late father, said she has exiled herself from the family after attending Obama&rsquo;s inauguration because she didn&rsquo;t want to become fodder for his foes. Obama and his family have not reached out to her either, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Obamas are her only family in the United States, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The White House said Obama has had no involvement in his aunt&rsquo;s case and believes it should run its ordinary course.</p>
<p>Onyango helped care for the president&rsquo;s half brothers and sister while living with Barack Obama Sr. in Kenya. She moved to the United States in 2000 and applied for asylum in 2002, but her request was rejected and she was ordered deported in 2004.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She is disabled and learning to walk again after being paralyzed for more than three months because of an autoimmune disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration experts say Onyango&rsquo;s relationship to the president could strengthen her claim that she would be subjected to danger at home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She became angry when discussing Obama&rsquo;s half brother who wrote a semi-autobiographical novel about the abusive Kenyan father he shares with the president. She called Mark Ndesandjo, who lives in China, an opportunist eager to capitalize on his famous brother.</p>
<p>Ndesandjo, who wrote &#8220;Nairobi to Shenzhen,&#8221; did not grow up with Obama. He has said he wrote the book in part to raise awareness of domestic violence. But Onyango said she was Ndesandjo&rsquo;s baby sitter while living with his father and never witnessed any abuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was only strict and argumentative, motivating one to do the best,&#8221; she said, acknowledging that in those days in Kenya, &#8220;It was politically correct to slap children to discipline them just as it was done elsewhere in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said Ndesandjo&rsquo;s claims against a man who died 27 years ago are unfair. The senior Obama had problems with alcohol and was difficult to live with sometimes because of his frustration over years of political persecution, but he wasn&rsquo;t a child abuser or wife beater, Onyango said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Onyango reserved special words of kindness for former President George W. Bush for a directive he put in place days before the election requiring federal agents get high-level approval to arrest fugitive immigrants, which directly affected Onyango. The directive made clear that U.S. officials worried about possible election implications of arresting Onyango.</p>
<p>She said she wants to thank Bush in person for the order, which gave her a measure of peace but was lifted weeks later.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved President Bush,&#8221; Onyango said while moving toward a framed photo of Bush and his wife standing with Barack and Michelle Obama at the White House on inauguration day. &#8220;He is my No. 1 man in my life because he helped me when I really needed that help.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&ldquo;The White House said Obama has had no involvement in his aunt&rsquo;s case and believes it should run its ordinary course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oddly, I feel a peculiar sympathy for this Zeituni Onyango and her plight. While millions of other hapless and ignorant border jumpers and visa cheats get a pass for this type of foolish or willful behavior, Comrade General Secretary BO&rsquo;s aunt could get deported simply because of who she is related to, in the course of what he feels to be politically expedient. After all, here is a man who apparently would grant tens of millions of illegal aliens an amnesty if he could get away with it, but is also willing to do nothing whatsoever to help a disabled blood relative, in what appears to be a comedy of errors on her part.   </p>
<p>There is something chillingly reptilian in these actions, which reflect quite poorly on him both as a General Secretary and a human being!</p>

		<p>Maybe George W. Bush can support Barack Obama&rsquo;s aunt so the burden of her food, clothing, housing, and medical expenses doesn&rsquo;t fall on the taxpayers.</p>

<p>Bush helped her because of his hyper Christianity. Obama can&rsquo;t help her because of the political fall out.</p>

		<p> Her case and Obama&rsquo;s attitude toward his aunt remind me of Prince Hal&rsquo;s words to his friend Sir John Falstaff after the former became King Henry: &#8220;I know you not, old man!&#8221; Under the bus with my typically White grandmother, old woman! You are now an embarrassment, and a non-person.</p>

		<p>  As an utra-conservative, I was against both wars from the start . I believe they are both just and warranted but I also believe as a whole, Islam and Liberty are the antithesis of each other and cannot co-exist very long on the same piece of ground . One of the first things Karzai and one of the interim presidents of Iraq did was to remind us or should I say,warn us that they were Muslim first . Probably any other time in our history President Bush would have been right . But at this time, because of abuses set in motion mostly by liberals since the end of WW2, these wars now threaten to collapse the economy .Just how much more can the American taxpayer stand ? Had it been up to me I would have put the troops on our own borders, expelled all Muslims that had come in via the Immigration Bill of 1965 . Ended all foreign aid to Muslim nations . Put American Muslims like the Nation of Islam under scrutiny, with a stern warning that they had better walk the straight and narrow . Defund ACLU, SPLC and other similar liberal groups, then rebuilt the WTC with the vow to never allow this to happen again . Then enact a cold war against the Muslim world . I feel sorry for all of the third worlders, I really do, but we are selling our childrens&rsquo; birthright . If I sound like an old fashioned isolationist, your absolutely right . </p>
