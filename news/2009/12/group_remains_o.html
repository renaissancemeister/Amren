<h1>Group: Remains of More Than 500 Animals Found at Philadelphia Home</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ross Levitt, CNN, December 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Investigators recovered the remains of more than 500 animals after executing a search warrant Wednesday at a home in the Feltonville section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to the city&rsquo;s chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s director of law enforcement said he believes the animals  &mdash;  the majority of which were chickens  &mdash;  were sacrificed as part of a Santeria religious ritual.</p>
<p>The animals included &#8220;dozens of sheep, goats .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. every type of farm animal you can think of,&#8221; the Philadelphia SPCA&rsquo;s law enforcement director, George Bengal, said.</p>
<p>The SPCA believes two sets of remains are those of small primates, possibly monkeys.</p>
<p>Philadelphia SPCA enforcement officers were first called to the home over the weekend to tend to two emaciated dogs. The organization said that after obtaining a search warrant, its officers found the home littered with animal remains. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The dogs were dirty and malnourished. They were put in protective custody after medical evaluation and treatment, the Philadelphia SPCA said.</p>
<p>Bengal said that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that rituals of Santeria  &mdash;  a religion similar to voodoo and originated in Cuba and Brazil  &mdash;  are permitted under the Constitution. But he believes these animals may not have been sacrificed humanely. If that is the case, the home&rsquo;s owner could be prosecuted, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The home&rsquo;s owner hasn&rsquo;t been seen for eight months but is believed to be in Mexico, Bengal said. {snip}</p>

<p>While the founding fathers enshrined the principle of freedom of religion into the constitution, they were also smart enough to know that the principle should not be strained to the limit. They assumed that the nation would follow sane immigration policies, and not deliberately bring in large numbers of practitioners of every strange and barbaric religion on earth. Even a &#8220;good idea&#8221; like freedom of religion can become a bad idea if it is taken to ridiculous limits.</p>

<p>So we can thank God that Cortez and his followers destroyed Mesoamerican heathenism. I can see it now, our culturally enriching southern immigrants building a constitutionally protected Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl in East Los Angeles. </p>

		<p>I doubt this character would feel any more remorse from killing a person than he did from those animals. He&rsquo;ll end up being let out to roam free in America and do more and possibly expand his dirty work. Same goes for Michael Vick.  Coldblooded killer types.   </p>

		<p>We can also have human sacrifice as long as we do it humanely. Just have a doctor present and call it doctor assistant suicide. With all the foreign doctors that we now have in this country, that is becoming a real possibility. </p>

<p><br>
Small primates?  Good grief!   Well, I certainly hope they were only monkeys.</p>
<p>I do hope they check that out thoroughly.</p>
<p>Anyway, when freedom of religion was written into the Constitution, the Founding Fathers had a certain specific and limited understanding of what was meant by &#8220;religion&#8221;&hellip; I am sure it did NOT include THIS!<br>

		<p>ghw: You are right on target. Christianity is the &#8220;religion&#8221; that the Framers of the Constitution had in mind when they drew up our nation&rsquo;s founding document. They did include Judaism because of the role of that religion in our history. But they never would have included Santeria in a million years.</p>
<p>This is one of the results that come from interpreting the Constituion out of context and according to the &#8220;living document&#8221; hypothesis, which although convenient is totally absurd.</p>

		<p>As an Hispanic American, I&rsquo;m shamed by this type of behavior.  These are the very people who give us all a bad name. They proclaim their Catholicism and at the same time practice primitive pagan rituals. We&rsquo;re supposed to have evolved to a more civilized state.  You don&rsquo;t go into Synagogues and see bullocks being sacrificed.</p>

    The founders of the USA had an innate horror of witchcraft and devilry, remember they weren&rsquo;t too many generations removed from Salem.</p>

<p>To clarify, all but I think two people executed at Salem were Christians.  What happened was that some girls were dabbling in witchcraft, and to keep from being found out they accused innocent people  &mdash;  Christians at that.</p>
<p>You could say that it was the witches who staged the witch hunt.</p>

		<p>It makes me proud to live in a country that welcomes those who sacrifice fauna for future divinations and the latest numbers in Power Ball. I do not know why we do not have a program of resettlement for the millions of Africans who practice female genital mutilation and of course the old stand by from the Pacific, the reducing of hat sizes by a factor of ten.<br>
     As Bill Clinton said, &#8221; We get our strength from our diversity,&#8221; and  what would be more All American than a shrunken head hanging from the rear view mirror or a Armani clad witch doctor performing a bris on every new born baby girl.<br>

		<p>  Hey, PETA members when are you going to wake up to the cultural changes under multiculturalism? All cultures weren&rsquo;t created with Western European assumptions about animal cruelty. We are going from a culture whose traditions came from Britain and Western Europe to one from the Third World. Animals are treated differently south of the border. Take a trip and see for yourself. </p>
