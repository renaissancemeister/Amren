		<p>Thankfully, many black mamas are naming their kids with atrocities like this one and it&rsquo;s one of the best things they could do to help out aware whites.  All we need a lot of times is a name in the news to know if a perp is black.  It&rsquo;s as good as a photo.</p>

<p>At least when I was taking French in middle school (&#8216;88-&#8216;91), France had that sort of law, and one had to get a special exemption for a name not on the list.</p>
<p>But there don&rsquo;t seem to be too many Spanish names, as Steve Sailer noted about a week ago.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a black girl&rsquo;s name who went to my school when I was in high school. Her name was Latrine.</p>
<p>Here is the definition of &#8220;latrine&#8221;:</p>
<p><b>la⋅trine</b> [luh-treen]</p>
<p>–noun<br>
a toilet or something used as a toilet, as a trench in the earth in a camp, or bivouac area. </p>
<p>How utterly embarassing to be named after a type of toilet. What was her mother thinking?</p>
<p>At least she wasn&rsquo;t named Dogpoo, Litterbox or some other potty-type name. </p>

		<p>My favorite name is D&rsquo;Brickashaw. A few years ago D&rsquo;Brickashaw Williams was the number one pick in the NFL draft, and he was announced by the NFL Commissioner. It would have been funny if he said what he was thinking. &#8220;D&rsquo;Brickashaw, what the heck kind of name is that?&#8221;</p>

		<p>I do feel sorry for the kid though. If she actually makes something of herself she will have to change that monstrosity to something more mainstream like Tricia. There have been studies that associate such monikers with lower likelyhood of being hired since employers associated ghetto names with ghetto behavior. Personally I would have a hard time hiring someone with a lower class White name.</p>

<p>A former black neighbor of mine back in St. Louis named her new dog D&rsquo;Brickashaw because of him.  And it was a female dog.  I looked up his name, and he was born at about the time the Thorn Birds, a modern telling of the Scarlett Letter, was a TV miniseries.  His parents gave him a corrupted version of the priest, Debriccissant.</p>

		<p>I thought I was a exaggerating a bit when I came up with N&rsquo;DeShawntavious as my archtypical ghetto black name.  Sadly, I appear to have been horribly mistaken.  Compared to Na&rsquo;Triciana Ma&rsquo;Khayvighnon, N&rsquo;DeShawntavious isn&rsquo;t even in the running.</p>

Philpot is a fine old Scottish name. The rest is ghetto gibberish. This is the names version of bling-bling: vulgar ostentation with zero regard for taste, restraint, or even pronounceability. </p>
<p>Other posters have mentioned lists of govt-approved baby names in such countries as France and Cuba. We need either something like that, or at least a strictly enforced limit of one apostrophe per customer. </p>

		<p>To some extent this too is happening in once Great Britain. One of the few paper which gets to the kernel of most events is the satirical Daily Mash and here is their take on it:</p>

		<p>All I can give are what the book &#8220;Freakonomics&#8221; gave as examples</p>
<p>For Girls: Crystal, Amber, Angel, Heaven, Destiny (all spellings),Ashley, Tonya, Mercedes,Brandy (all spellings) and Misty (all spellings) Jasmine (all spellings) and others. </p>
<p>For Boys: Dustin, Cody, Bobby - Most of the websites concentrated on the girl names for some reason, plus it was stated that boy names generally do not fall prey to the trends that girl names for some reason do. </p>
<p>You can almost tell how old someone is by what their name is. For example when I was in school some of the most common names were Michelle, Jennifer, Michael and Brent. Now those sound like mom and dad names. </p>

		<p>Hey Spartan24, #35, there is nothing wrong with the name Bobby.  My son is named for his grandfather, Robert, and if you look it up in history, it is a fine old name, ie; Robert the Bruce, Robert Browning, Robert Burns (my son&rsquo;s name), and many men named Robert have it shortened to Bobby.  As for the rest of those names, I somewhat agree with you.  </p>

		<p>To me_leelee: I think what Spartacus was referring to is the tendency among lower-class whites to use the nickname forms of traditional names as the &#8220;official&#8221; name. </p>
