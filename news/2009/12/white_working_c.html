			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), December 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Labour has let down white working-class people who have suffered from the impact of largescale immigration, a Cabinet minister admitted yesterday.</p>
<p>Communities Secretary John Denham said councils and government bodies had been &#8216;blind&rsquo; to the needs of this section of society.</p>
<p>The backtracking came in the face of the growing threat to Labour&rsquo;s core vote from the far-right British National Party.</p>
<p>Yesterday Mr Denham said in a speech to union members at the TUC that efforts to tackle inequality &#8216;must include poorer white working-class communities, as well as disadvantaged minority ethnic communities.</p>
<p>Mr Denham said areas with high immigration levels felt a sense of &#8216;insecurity and unfairness&rsquo; because of the impact of new arrivals on jobs and public services.</p>
<p>Unless councils act, these could lead to tensions and resentment, he said.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;Many local agencies have a clear and good commitment to tackling racism and race inequality and are right to do so. But on its own this is not enough.</p>
<p>&#8216;We can only challenge racism and race inequality effectively as part of a strategy that tackles all forms of inequality and disadvantage.</p>
<p>&#8216;This must include poorer white working class communities, as well as disadvantaged minority ethnic communities.</p>
<p>&#8216;Agencies which have been blind to these issues, or thought their only remit was to address minority issues, must re-assess the way they work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His comments are the latest attempt by ministers to address fears over immigration in Labour heartlands, and confront the threat from the British National Party.</p>
<p>They follow a speech by Prime Minister Gordon Brown earlier this month in which he said it was &#8216;not racist&rsquo; to talk about immigration.</p>
<p>Addressing the Trades Union Congress today, Mr Denham pointed to similarities between black and white working class groups.</p>
<p>Poor white boys had more in common with their poor black classmates than with middle class whites, he said.</p>
<p>The inequality agenda should focus on &#8216;need&rsquo; and not &#8216;outdated ideology or assumptions which may no longer be true&rsquo;, he said. These could lead to white working class boys being &#8216;overlooked&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If Government policies are seen to be unfair, he said, they could be exploited by groups seeking to &#8216;drive people apart&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have to avoid the perception that some groups are singled out for special treatment,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;When we target help at one group, we cannot allow others to be left behind, or to feel disconnected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;By ensuring that our policies are both fair, and seen to be fair, we reduce the risk that they can be exploited by others who would distort them to drive people apart.</p>
<p>&#8216;And we properly address the complexities of the problem: ensuring that the white working class boy struggling in class gets the support that he needs, just as his black and Asian classmates do.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read this kind of story about once every three months for the last eight and a half years.  The first time I read this kind of story was in June 2001, after the Parliamentary elections.  A month or so before, Middle Easterners and other minorities rioted in the town of Oldham.  As a result, the BNP candidate finished in third and ahead of the Tories in that constituency/district, and of course Labour won it b/c, at least the BBC implied, it&rsquo;s a yellow dog Labour district.  </p>
<p>But the story out of that const. the BNP&rsquo;s 3rd place finish.  The establishment liblabcon media came up with the excuse that &#8220;major parties&#8221; were &#8220;ignoring&#8221; the plight of the white working classes, &#8220;allowing the BNP an inlet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Question:  For 8.5 years, they&rsquo;ve been bemoaning their own ignorance of the white working class.  When are they going to end their ignorance?  It stands to reason that one of them would actually address those issues (or at least pretend to) in 8.5 years, rather than just say they haven&rsquo;t been doing so.  My reasoning tells me that they won&rsquo;t stop ignoring the white working class, so the only way to help the white working class is to vote BNP.</p>

		<p>This is just PR. Labour doesn&rsquo;t care about white workers, they only care about winning elections. Their stated policy to blitzkrieg Britain with Third World immigrants has made that perfectly clear. </p>

<p>Obviously they are stalling for time until they import enough new voters to drown out the White working classes voices.</p>

		<p>The results for the last Euro-election in Britain were very instructive.The Euro-election was contested on the basis of proportional representation and the result was a complete collapse in the Labour vote - but no real increase in the Tory vote.<br>
 The reason is that Labour&rsquo;s core working-class support base (who would never, ever vote Tory)simply abstained from voting (they, quite rightly realise that none of the main parties have anything to offer them) or defected to UKIP (single issye anti-EU party) or the BNP.<br>
 The realisation is afoot amongst the working class that Labour&rsquo;s policy of globalisation and massive, uncontrolled immigration is exceedingly pernicious to working-class self-interest.<br>
 It is the task and duty of the BNP to capitalize on this righteous discontent and actively court the working-class vote.</p>

<p>Not in crime rate, and certainly not genetically.</p>
<p>I do admit though that racial desegregation combined with immigration has led to the mores of the white working class all too often being infected with a pernicious black cultural influence.</p>
<p>But beyond that this statement by the Labour Party Hack is pure idiocy, designed to give the false impression that the government can look after the interests of working class whites and poor blacks at the same time; when such a thing would actually be impossible even if Labour wanted to help working class whites.</p>
<p>Which they sure as hell don&rsquo;t.<br>

		<p>Reported in January 2009, overall one in 30 primary schools have more than 70 per cent of youngsters with a foreign language as their mother tongue. In one part of the country, six in ten schools are in such a position. It means one in seven youngsters in primary schools - or 466,420 - do not have English as their first language. Critics last night said the high proportions are another sign of the impact Labour&rsquo;s open door on immigration and risks hampering integration. It also has serious implications for already-stretched schools resources. Unions have estimated educating a single non-English speaking pupil can cost up to £30,000 a year, although these figures do not break down how many pupils cannot speak English at all, only whether it is their first language. Labour MP Frank Field, the co-chairman of the Cross Party Group on Balanced Migration who unearthed the statistics, said: &#8220;These figures make a nonsense of the Government&rsquo;s aim of integration and show the very real strain that uncontrolled, large scale immigration is already placing upon our society.&#8221; His co-chairman and Tory MP Nicholas Soames added: &#8220;In hundreds of primary schools, English is the second language for over 70 per cent or more of the pupils. &#8220;How can these children be expected to integrate into our society, if they are being taught in schools where is English is the mother-tongue of no pupils or a minority of pupils?&#8221;<br>

		<p>Labour no more represents the interests of the British white working class than the Democratic Party represents the interests of the American white working class.  The difference is that here in the United States the white working class has no where to go, since no one can argue that the Republicans represent their interests.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m amazed that more Britains aren&rsquo;t voting for the BNP. I talked to an 85-year British war vet who said he opposes immigration and the destruction of his country because of it. I asked him if he&rsquo;d vote for the BNP. He said no because it&rsquo;s a racist party. It&rsquo;s this kind of madness that has infected the British people that makes me want to just throw in the towel. <br>
Of course, I&rsquo;ll never give up, but this is so insane.</p>
<p>If the English, French, and Germans wanted to clean house, they could do so very easily because there are parties that are willing to do it. It&rsquo;s like these people have gone mad.</p>

<p>   Labour stopped supporting the British working classes during the seventies. They now represent the Fourth Estate, rich privileged liberals, minorities, and multinational corporations. Anyone who votes Labour expecting them to better the life of average Indigenous British is kidding themselves  &mdash;  vote BNP.</p>

		<p>Yes it is insanity Robert. The BNP is a perfectly fine Christian, family oriented, pro-British party that every true Britain should aspire to be a part of. The problem is the modern liberal public indoctrination they are submitted to in the public schools and media.</p>

		<p>Of course the Labour Party Minister is only paying lip service to this agonizingly painful trend. The systematic elimination of the working and middle classes is rampant throughout westernized democracies. Soon we&rsquo;ll have two classes of people: the very poor and the very rich   &mdash;  - the haves and the have nots.</p>
<p>To illustrate this sad phenomenon I have only to cite the example of Woodwards Department stores in the Vancouver area of British Columbia, Canada where I live. Woodwards was a department store chain established in western Canada that catered to the middle class providing good quality merchandise at reasonable prices. Woowards closed down a number of years ago as their customer base dwindled. Upon the demise of Woodwards, western Canadians saw the rise of Wal-Marts, Kmarts, and other department store chain that offer inferior quality goods at cheap prices that the poor can afford. We also saw the rise of elitist, expensive shops that cater to the whims of the wealthy during this time. </p>
<p>Tragic days are here and forthcoming.</p>

		<p>The BNP should take this opportunity to be a competent, practical, service-oriented party for middle and working class white Brits. The best way to defeat the &#8220;racist&#8221; label is to provide tangible, practical results. And be squeaky clean because you know any charge of corruption will get blown way out of proportion.</p>
<p>Fill potholes, clean up garbage, and most of all protect white children on the street.</p>
<p>Easier said than done, I know, but the clock is ticking on white UK.</p>

<p>I hear you.  They&rsquo;re far-gone, alright.    <br>
But I wouldn&rsquo;t call it &#8220;insane&#8221; &hellip;  I&rsquo;d call it brainwashed.   (Not that there&rsquo;s too much difference.) They&rsquo;ve been brainwashed all their lives, to the point where they&rsquo;d argue that hot is cold and up is down.  They&rsquo;re so confused, they don&rsquo;t know whether they&rsquo;re coming or going.   &mdash;  - Just how the media masters and the politicians want it.</p>

Richard</p>
<p>And also, those Kmarts and such offer not only inferior quality goods but which are almost exclusively made abroad and imported, thus helping to undermine and destroy our own domestic jobs and industries, further accelerating our economic/industrial decline while building up the economies and industries of Asiatic countries. Countries which could soon become our rivals and enemies, but which will have our technology and factories which we have very graciously exported to them!  <br>
Oops! Change that &#8220;gracious&#8221; to &#8220;stupid&#8221;.</p>

<p>How does he know it&rsquo;s a &#8220;racist&#8221; party?   Oh, because the other parties all say so!  Ah well, then it must be so.</p>
<p>Any sensible (and fair) person knows that if you want to find out about someone or some party, you must go straight to the source and get the real truth from their own mouths.  You don&rsquo;t go to their rivals or listen to those who hate them if you want to find out the unvarnished truth of what they represent. </p>
