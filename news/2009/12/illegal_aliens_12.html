<h1>Illegal Aliens Sent to ICE</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse James Deconto, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), December 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Orange County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has identified 280 illegal immigrants in its jail and turned over a dozen of them to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since joining the federal government&rsquo;s Secure Communities program in March.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not out here pulling up on a construction job trying to pull Hispanics every day,&#8221; said Sheriff Lindy Pendergrass. &#8220;We are not running an immigration program going out here and snatching people off the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tonight the Orange County commissioners will consider recommendations from the county&rsquo;s Human Relations Commission to make sure the sheriff&rsquo;s department&rsquo;s implementation is &#8220;as transparent and socially just as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commission is asking the county to:</p>
<p>Ask the sheriff&rsquo;s office to issue citations, rather than making arrests, for minor misdemeanors such as driving without a license. The city of Durham has already adopted this policy.</p>
<p>Keep tabs on the number and types of criminals being detained through the program every three months.</p>
<p>Establish a complaint procedure for cases involving racial profiling or minor offenses.</p>
<p>Give officers training to avoid profiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the consequences of someone being arrested .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can now include deportation and the separation of families, it is essential that local law enforcement officers exercise a high level of vigilance to prevent racial profiling,&#8221; the commission wrote in a memo to the county commissioners.</p>
<p>Pendergrass said most of the recommendations are unnecessary because racial profiling is not a problem in his department and deputies are already issuing citations where appropriate. Of 221 Hispanics stopped in traffic over the past two years, 143 have been issued warnings and not even citations, he said. Those stops make up about 15.5 percent of the total stops for all ethnicities. Hispanics comprise 6.3 percent of the county&rsquo;s population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but census figures for Hispanics are often lower than the actual population because undocumented immigrants are difficult to survey.</p>

<p>Yeah. But only if they&rsquo;re criminal aliens. Once again, bureaucrats are looking for excuses not to enforce the law.<br>

		<p>   Failing to arrest and confiscate the vehicles of person driving without a license is one reason for the many accidents caused by people without insurance or a license.<br>
   It seems to me that the commission could be held liable for all damages caused by anyone warned or cited for driving without a license and the commission could be sued and possibly jailed for aiding in criminal activity and recklessly endangering citizens by assisting those driving without a license to remain as drivers. <br>
   I have personally been hit at a red light by someone without a license and had friends killed by someone who was previously stopped for driving without a license but released. Neither appeared for their court dates.<br>

		<p>Why do I, a American citizen, have to follow the law, when if I dont I can be arrested and/or fined. But people that sneak into this Country are allowed to get at the least a ticket and not deported as the laws of this Country are written?<br>
I guess I am to old to understand this new double standard.</p>

		<p>When the law is selectively enforced, the motivation, and more importantly, the justification, for people to respect the law evaporates.</p>
<p>Our leaders are operating under the VERY mistaken assumption that they have totalitarian power over our citizenry.  In fact, the exact opposite is true.  ONLY the willingness of the vast majority of people to not only cooperate but invest the majority of their effort in support, the majority of the time, allows our system to operate.  Since they can&rsquo;t force us to do anything, what they are doing is very dangerous indeed.</p>
<p>One day, probably sooner rather than later, people just won&rsquo;t support them.  When that day comes, there will be&hellip;.trouble.  Especially if someone offers them a better deal.</p>

<p>Why not? It&rsquo;s not called &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; immigration for nothing. <br>
