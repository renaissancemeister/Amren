<h1>Charlotte Police Officer Charged With 2 Sex Crimes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The State (Columbia, South Carolina), December 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police say one of their own officers pulled over two young women while on duty and sexually assaulted them in his police cruiser within the last two weeks.</p>
<p>And Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe said &#8220;it would be naïve&#8221; to believe that the officer hadn&rsquo;t assaulted other women. He issued the officer&rsquo;s mug shot to the media, hoping other potential victims will come forward.</p>
<p>Marcus Jackson, 25, who&rsquo;s been an officer with CMPD since 2008, was arrested by detectives Wednesday night at police headquarters after an investigation that began Monday.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s charged with three counts of sexual battery, second-degree sex offense, extortion, kidnapping, indecent exposure and two counts of felonious restraint.</p>
<p>Monroe said Jackson was &#8220;terminated, effective immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The first was on Dec. 18. Monroe said Jackson  &mdash;  wearing his uniform and driving his marked patrol car  &mdash;  pulled over a 17-year-old girl, forced her into his car, drove to another location and committed sex acts.</p>
<p>A relative of the girl called police Monday night and officers began an investigation.</p>
<p>As detectives were collecting information, Monroe said, a 21-year-old woman came forward Tuesday night and said she&rsquo;d been sexually assaulted under similar circumstances by Jackson on Monday.</p>

		<p>The reality is men of color are much more likely to be caught engaging in this sort of activity, even with the additional protection and deference their skin color usually affords them. The irony being &#8216;false accusations&rsquo; like this seemed to be very common when a white man or an &#8216;uncle tom&rsquo; is found who doesn&rsquo;t have the proper respect for &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, this is before child custody disputes enter the picture.  </p>

		<p>In some respects these rapes are similar to the Kobe Bryant rape:  A celebrity&hellip;..or authority figure thinking their status protects them from being thought capable of such acts.</p>
<p>Such thinking is based more in stupidity than ignorance though, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see this perp&rsquo;s scores on any tests he had to take and how much being black helped him get the job.</p>

		<p>Here in the greater New York area, there are an astonishing number of police officers &#8220;of color,&#8221; both male and female I might add, who are charged and/or found guilty of one manner of malfeasance or another - and the cases are invariably swept under the rug and discussed only as briefly as possible by the media, etc. </p>
<p>One cop-involved shooting or the like of a &#8220;minority&#8221; will of course dominate news coverage for weeks and likely become a national story in short order. Though to fair, more and more frequently, those involve non-white cops as well! </p>
<p>Really makes one feel safe&hellip;</p>

		<p>Anonymous #2:</p>
<p>In most jurisdictions the charge of first degree rape requires certain elements that are not always present (i.e. use of, or threat to use, deadly force; presence or implied possession of firearm; etc). Also, if actual intercourse does not take place then rape can&rsquo;t be charged. </p>

<p>It depends upon the type of sex act, if he didn&rsquo;t have straight sex but say fondled her, it would be sexual assault for example.<br>

		<p>There was a similar situation in Rochester (NY) a few years ago: black cop pulling over young white women and sexually molesting them.  Once he was charged and identified, a number of women came forward - I think there were at least six.  He was convicted. </p>

		<p>I was once told by a friend, he is a Major in the NG and a law enforcement officer, that this country will, &#8220;Have it&#8221; when the police and military are subverted.  One begins to wonder if that isn&rsquo;t in full force when we hear of the Department of Homeland Security issuing bulletins to LE about good citizens being terrorists because they are anti-immigration or, they are dangerous because they are a returning vetran!  This will of course be the last straw in breaking our country down.  Please see the Oath Keepers for some further background.  BTW, this friend of mine is retiring from both the military and LE and is moving to the country in the upper West.  He says that is the only sane alternative to what is happening in his life.</p>

		<p>Charlotte is the land of affirmative action. Blacks hold most of the jobs in city and county government, street crews, postal clerks, UPS drivers, jobs at the local community college(CPCC), and even at the board of elections office. Whites, especially white males need not apply; although one will find just a few token whites. And most of the blacks one encounters doing routine business have chips on their shoulders and are rude, acting like they are being bothered by doing their jobs. It&rsquo;s really sickening. I hate this city.</p>

		<p>When relocating-or considering a relocation,taking note of the racial makeup of a city,county,what-have-you is no longer a sufficient precaution before loading up the U-Haul.</p>
<p>In this day and age,you must also check on the demographics of the local law enforcement agencies that are supposedly getting paid to look out for you. Too many minorities on the local PD for your comfort level? If so,then you need to take a look at other areas.</p>
<p>This is a precaution that can literally save your life.</p>

		<p>If these were black or mex females then who cares?

		<p>Several posters have asked why this guy wasn&rsquo;t he charged with rape.  </p>
<p>The definition of rape, as I understand it, is penetration, however how slight, by a person or object.  The question is then: Was there any penetration? </p>
<p>Be that as it may, the kidnapping charge carries more weight.  It&rsquo;s a federal offense.</p>

<p>Awarded a degree after completing only 9 hours, is equivalent to an AA master&rsquo;s degree anytime, because most blacks are passed for just attending class, so whether they complete 9 hours or 120 hours it all amounts to the same.<br>
