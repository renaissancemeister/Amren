<h1><a href="http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/dec/09/records-ordered-to-explain-panthers-handling/">Justice Dept. Subpoenaed in New Black Panthers Case</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, December 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, frustrated by the Justice Department&rsquo;s failure to explain the dismissal of charges against New Black Panther Party members who disrupted a Philadelphia polling place during last year&rsquo;s elections, has subpoenaed the department demanding records showing how the case was handled.</p>
<p>David P. Blackwood, the commission&rsquo;s general counsel, said Tuesday in a letter to the Justice Department that efforts since June to obtain an explanation had proceeded &#8220;without any success&#8221; and the &#8220;dearth of cooperation&#8221; had prompted the commission to issue subpoenas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The commission has asked the department why a civil complaint against the New Black Panther Party (NBPP) and three of its members was dismissed after a federal judge in Philadelphia ordered default judgments in the case. The NBPP refused to respond to the charges or appear in court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said Tuesday that the department was reviewing the commission&rsquo;s letter. She said that the Civil Division at the department reviews &#8220;these types of requests in accordance with longstanding guidelines governing the disclosure of internal department information.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the documents being sought are witness statements, copies of any investigation conducted by the Justice Department, reports of suspected voting intimidation, all documents that influenced the decision to drop three of the defendants as parties to the case, and documents regarding communications by Mrs. King, Mr. Perrelli and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. relating to the case.</p>
<p>Mr. Blackwood also said the commission wanted the names of all Justice Department personnel who worked on the case, including those who interviewed witnesses in Philadelphia, others who exercised decision-making authority and all those in the appellate section who reviewed the litigation.</p>

The first question that I would ask is &#8216;had these men, dressed in pseudo-military garb, carrying truncheons, wearing leather gloves, and sporting dark sunglasses, been white, would you consider that voter intimidation?&rsquo;</p>

		<p>It was dismissed because Attorney General Eric Holder does not want to alienate black activists, black radicals, or blacks in general.  He also does not want to discourge black radicalism.</p>
<p>The ostensible reason given to the gullible masses will be that the Black Panther was just protecting black voters.  The Black Panther was fighting white racist who were scaring black voters away.  Once Holder issues that excuse the Civil Rights Commission will say, OKay.  Now we are satisfied.  The mainstream media will then agree it was all a misunderstanding.<br>

		<p>This is very simple, AG Eric Holder holds the same views as the black panthers do, end of story.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s much simpler than that.  Nothing will happen because Eric Holder and Obama are black, and they share the same views as the black panthers.  Moreover, Obama benefits from that sort of intimidation at the polls.  You&rsquo;ll see more of it come the midterm elections.</p>

		<p>While I do not expect Holder&rsquo;s Justice Department to actually ignore a subpoena, they will certainly delay and &#8220;forget&#8221; and &#8220;lose evidence&#8221; as much as possible.</p>

		<p>Excuse me! but if you fail to appear in court to face charges against you, A WARRANT IS PUT PUT FOR YOUR ARREST! never mind having the charges dropped.  Looks like racist Eric Holder and his racist cronies don&rsquo;t know the first thing about the law.  No doubt they all are the result of &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; where you are automatically placed in a job that you know nothing about because of the color of your skin.  </p>

<p>Perhaps not your intention, but you make it sound as if this is some inconvenience he has to deal with. No. Eric Holder is on their side. </p>
<p>Given the way he has handled this incident, coupled with some statements he has made in the past, I have no doubt that if he could he would give these thugs a freakin&rsquo; medal for intimidating and assaulting white people at voting polls. I&rsquo;m sure he wishes he could set up a group of them at every polling place in America to do just that. </p>
<p>Pun alert:</p>
<p>I guess you would call that a &#8220;Colour Guard.&#8221;</p>
