<h1>Inland Area More Dependent on Immigrant Labor, Study Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Olson, Press-Enterprise (San Bernardino), November 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Inland area is more dependent on immigrant labor than most other large U.S. urban areas, a new study concludes.</p>
<p>The report, by the Latham, N.Y.-based Fiscal Policy Institute, also revealed that although foreign-born workers are more likely to be concentrated in low-paying occupations than native-born people, they represent an increasing share of high-earning, highly skilled professionals, such as nurses and engineers.</p>
<p>The study found that 22 percent of people living in Riverside and San Bernardino counties between 2005 and 2007 were foreign-born, but they comprised 29 percent of civilian workers at least 16 years old.</p>
<p>The difference was less pronounced in most of the other regions the study analyzed. In the 25 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, 24 percent of the labor force and 20 percent of the population was born abroad.</p>
<p>Immigrants are disproportionately represented in the work force because they are more likely to be of working age than native-born counterparts, said the principal author of the report, David Dyssegaard Kallick.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study released Sunday found foreign-born people had a big presence in occupations that in the past were not associated with immigrants. In the Inland area, a third of nurses, pharmacists and health therapists were immigrants, as were more than 18 percent of executives and managers.</p>
<p>The study also looked at economic output, which it defined as the wages of workers and the earnings of businesses. Immigrants had a bigger share of the economic output  &mdash;  25 percent  &mdash;  of the Inland area than they did in most other metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8216;LEFT UNFILLED&rsquo;</p>
<p>During the time when the study&rsquo;s data was collected, immigrants were vital in ensuring the Inland area&rsquo;s rapid growth, said Paul Herrera, spokesman for the San Bernardino County Economic Development Agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally when unemployment is low, they are very beneficial,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They come in and pick up jobs that would be left unfilled.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Inland unemployment now at 14.6 percent, immigrants&rsquo; impact is uncertain, especially because it&rsquo;s unclear how many have left the Inland area to seek work elsewhere, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although some immigrants are well-educated, a much larger number  &mdash;  especially illegal immigrants  &mdash;  have a low level of schooling and skills, he [Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Immigration Studies] said.</p>

		<p>And I though it was only lettuce picking that American workers wouldn&rsquo;t do. Who&rsquo;d have thought that suddenly there&rsquo;s no job Americans can be counted on to do? How long are we going to put up with this propaganda? American jobs are being given to foreign workers by our own government who continues to bring in<br/>
these people who undercut wages and leave US workers out in the cold. This is suicide for our country.</p>

		<p>I live in the Inland Empire, and I can tell you that whole cities here are comprised of immigrants, largely Hispanic.  I used to teach in a public school, and the kids in my classes were almost 100% Hispanic, with some kids fluent in English but most not.  The cities of Ontario, Pomona, Perris, Rialto, and others have a vast majority of Hispanics living there.  The cities closest to the mountains - Glendora, LaVerne, Claremont, Upland - have a majority of whites and Asians.  As a teacher, I quickly found out that the Asian kids became fluent in English within a year.  Hispanics often NEVER became fluent.  Asian parents were busy working AND going to school to better themselves.  Hispanic parents worked or collected welfare, and for the most part steadfastly refused to learn English, even though we offered free classes WITH babysitting morning, afternoon, and evening.  So YOU figure out who employers would be more likely to hire; and these days, believe me, many over qualified workers take jobs that are beneath them just to get by.  It&rsquo;s a myth that Americans won&rsquo;t take certain jobs - Americans want to work, and they&rsquo;ll do whatever they have to do to put bread on the table.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s sad to hear about this happening.  I lived in this area from the time I was in kindergarten until I was in sixth grade  &mdash;  Hemet, to be precise.  We left in 1978 because the mexicans were just then starting to encroach upon this formerly idyllic part of southern california.  I can&rsquo;t even imagine what it must be like now.  I wouldn&rsquo;t even want to visit to find out.</p>

		<p>Another economic &#8220;argument to justify the rapid race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. Think about what the immigtant enthusiasts are saying:race-the health of the economy requires the very rapid race-relaplacement of the NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN popultion. How can this be? It is a bold face lie. How are NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS made better off being rapidly race-relaced by post 1965 non-whites.</p>
<p>How did NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS manage to survive without the asian in AMERICA for devades and decades? Very well thank you.<br/>
Post-1965 immigration policy is really a policy of invasion. And this policy is supported by the Republican party and either pesident Sarah Palin or hindu president Bobby Jindal.</p>
<p>Do not support a moratorium&hellip;support a complete shutdown of the post-1965 non-white invasion.</p>
<p>I should also point out that the assumption behind all these studies is that a extreme labor scacrcity would be bad thing? Bad for who? A severe labor scarcity would mean higher eages for the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE population. How come numbersusa won&rsquo;t acknowledge that NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAS exist and the most t o lose</p>
