<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A career criminal who slaughtered three members of a family in their apartment in New York&rsquo;s trendy Upper West Side Thursday plunged to his death after tripping over his baggy pants.</p>
<p>The bloodshed began when the killer barged into the family&rsquo;s third floor apartment and opened fire at around 1:45 p.m. Thursday, near a string of upscale shops.</p>
<p>Gunman Hector Quinones blew away 24-year-old Carlos Rodriguez Jr., and his father Carlos Rodriguez Sr., 52, and then repeatedly stabbed grandfather Fernando Gonzalez, 87, to death before the elder Rodriguez&rsquo;s wife and adult daughter walked unwittingly into the carnage in the apartment they all shared.</p>
<p>As soon as Gisela Rodriguez, 49, and her daughter, Leyanis, 28, walked inside, Quinones, 44, opened fire again at the mother, grazing the back of her head, police said.</p>
<p>He then went after Gisela&rsquo;s daughter, who scrambled for safety and ran to a nearby bedroom. The killer was inches away from grabbing her but tripped over his low-slung pants, sources said.</p>
<p>The horrified woman managed to slam and lock the door just in time, only to find the bloodied bodies of her brother and dad inside.</p>
<p>A relentless Quinones kicked the door in and lunged for Leyanis, but she was able to make it to a fire escape, screaming for help to construction workers on the roof of the building next door.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fleeing empty-handed, Quinones ditched his gun, a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol loaded with hollow-point bullets, and made a dash down a rear fire escape.</p>
<p>But again, his low-slung pants fell to his ankles, tripping him and sending him falling three stories to his death, authorities said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suspect, who has 14 prior arrests for offenses that include manslaughter, assault, drugs and robbery, knew Rodriguez Sr. from when they were in prison together, sources said.<br>

		<p>This is why we should encourage, not discourage, the sagging style.  I read this kind of story about once a month on average, where the suspect&rsquo;s sagging pants makes it easier on the cop.  It&rsquo;s like a criminal dumb enough to walk around in the open with leg shackles.  What kind of criminal would be that dumb?  Oh, I know the answer to this one, teacher.  Pick me, pick me&hellip;</p>

		<p>Awesome now has a new definition.</p>
<p>awe·some (ô&rsquo;sem) adj.<br>
1. inspiring or displaying awe<br>
2. Slang excellent or outstanding<br>
3. When a murderous thug&rsquo;s low slung pants fall to his ankles tripping him and sending him falling three stories to his death.</p>

		<p>First we have a thug in New York killed by the policeman he was trying to gun down after holding his MAC-10 sideways, causing it to stovepipe-jam, and now we have another gunman plummet three stories to his death after his sagging pants trip him off a fire-escape.</p>
<p>I only hope these Darwinian-selection incidents are the beginning of a trend.</p>

		<p>What a tragedy.  I&rsquo;m sure he was a &#8220;good boy&#8221; and another suspended sentence for these homicides certainly would have straightened him out.</p>

<p>I am sure he was a &ldquo;good boy&rdquo; and an &ldquo;honors student,&rdquo; this &ldquo;underprivileged youth&rdquo; and likely aspiring brain surgeon or environmental scientist. If it were only not for the deck being so highly stacked against him, or his pants so dwindling on his emaciated frame, as to cause such a lowly and desperate demise.</p>
<p>How will I sleep tonight, with such an atrocity of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; fresh in my head?</p>

It was just another drug deal gone bad and all three of the murdered guys were drug dealing bums just like the murderer.</p>
