<h1>Rod Liddle Branded &#8216;Racist&rsquo; for Blog Blaming Crime on Black Men</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Davis, This Is London, December 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Journalist Rod Liddle has come under fire for writing an allegedly racist blog.</p>
<p>The former BBC Today programme editor suggested that young African-Caribbean men were responsible for the &#8220;overwhelming majority&#8221; of violent crime in London.</p>
<p>The comments, published on his blog on Spectator magazine&rsquo;s website, have prompted outrage with one of his colleagues threatening to quit.</p>
<p>Liddle wrote of the case of two black teenage rappers who were jailed last week for plotting to murder a pregnant 15-year-old by throwing her in a canal.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;It could be an anomaly, of course, but it isn&rsquo;t. The overwhelming majority of street crime, knife crime, gun crime, robbery and crimes of sexual violence in London is carried out by young men from the African-Caribbean community.</p>
<p>&#8220;In return we have rap music, goat curry and a far more vibrant and diverse understanding of cultures which were once alien to us. For which, many thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liddle defended himself against accusations of racism. He said: &#8220;I cannot think of anything more vile than racism. I think it is disgusting. The issue here is not racism, it is one of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an important argument to be had about crime levels in London, Manchester and Birmingham which are down to culture. It is nothing to do with race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said: &#8220;We have all got so used to Rod Liddle&rsquo;s low-level racism that it has lost the power to shock.&#8221; She added that it was &#8220;statistically false&#8221; to say black men committed most of the crimes he listed.</p>
<p>Playwright Bonnie Greer, who appeared on the BBC&rsquo;s Question Time to challenge BNP leader Nick Griffin, said: &#8220;My response would be to say that the overwhelming majority of paedophiles, murderers, war-mongers and football hooligans are white males and all we got in return was beans on toast and Top Gear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Massie, a colleague of Liddle at the Spectator, wrote a column criticising him and saying he had considered resigning.</p>
<p>Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator, said the magazine &#8220;stands up for the right to offend; our blogs often say things that people find offensive but that&rsquo;s part of our right of free expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rod is one of the greatest writers in Britain today. His column and blog are loved by readers. It&rsquo;s a significant part of my job as editor to defend people&rsquo;s right to be offensive.&#8221;<br>

<p>Of course, in reality, it has everything to do with race - but, in unfree Britain, it is illegal to acknowledge this.</p>

		<p>So the usual whiners cry that Mr. Liddle&rsquo;s assertions are &#8220;statistically false&#8221; and that &#8220;the overwhelming majority of paedophiles, murderers, war-mongers and football hooligans are white males and all we got in return was beans on toast and Top Gear.&rdquo;  And yet absolutely <i>no</i> one makes even the slightest attempt to determine what the actual figures <i>are</i>.  We&rsquo;re simply supposed to take their   &mdash;   obviously unbiased, of course   &mdash;   word for it.</p>
<p>Well, it probably doesn&rsquo;t matter, since Liddle publicly gelded himself with his &#8220;I cannot think of anything more vile than racism&#8221; <i>mea culpa</i>.  When will White people ever learn that no contrition for telling the truth is ever enough?  <br>

		<p>Interesting hysterical reaction to Liddle&rsquo;s comments, ranging from outright denial that blacks are responsible for the great majority of violent crime, to ignoring the truth of his comments and simply castigating him, apparently for having the temerity to speak the unspeakable.</p>
<p>Any society in which the plain truth, plain truth known to everyone becomes forbidden, is doomed.  It has already ceased to be a civil society and is already on the descent into anarchy and ruin.</p>
<p>Watch for the US to implement prohibitions on &#8220;offensive speech,&#8221; as have the UK and Canada. Of course, such speech is forbidden only to white Christians, who are not allowed to take offense at the grossest forms of deliberate abuse hurled at them by Muslims, blacks, Amer-Indians, or any form of aboriginals. </p>
<p>And you Asians, you guys better watch yourselves.  You&rsquo;re becoming too successful and contributing too much to be allowed to give offense or take it from those who abuse you.  That&rsquo;ll teach you to be productive, law-abiding, and civil. You&rsquo;ll soon be in the same boat with us white folks.</p>

<p>Sorry Rod, but taking any notice at all of such matters is &#8220;racism&#8221;. Did you really think that even the slightest criticism of multiculturalism would be allowed to pass unnoticed? You must accept that Caribbean blacks are interchangeable with whites in all ways at all times or else you are &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>Jared Taylor: So what is racism, anyway? For whites (and only for whites), it is anything that deviates from the following principles: Race is an utterly insignificant matter. It means nothing, explains nothing, and stands for nothing. The races are not only equal, they are interchangeable. Therefore, it makes no difference if the neighborhood turns Mexican or the nation turns non-white or your children marry Haitians. For whites, race is not a valid criterion for any purpose, and any decision they make on the basis of race is immoral. For whites to take notice of race at all is &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>If it has nothing to do with race, why do we find comparably violent cultures wherever people of African heritage live?  If he&rsquo;s going to speak frankly about race, he should go all the way and say what deep-down almost everyone already knows.  Such statements only compromise his credibility, and cede ground to multi-culturalists he ostensibly opposes.  Otherwise, just provide more free education  &mdash;  that will fix everything.</p>

<p></p>
<p>What is the problem here if this is indeed the case. And there is zero doubt in my mind that these &#8220;african carribeans&#8221; are responsible for the &#8220;overwhelming majority&#8221; of London&rsquo;s violent crime. That is unless blacks in the UK decided to behave themselves there. Like that would really happen. </p>
<p>On a side note, can anyone tell me why blacks in the UK are refered to as &#8220;african carribean&#8221;? I would have thought the pc term for them would be african English, african British or something similar. Too, I would have assumed that UK&rsquo;s blacks would originate from the african continent, rather than the Carribean.</p>

		<p>I bet if it was whites causing &#8216;enrichment&rsquo;, they would call their actions racism itself, and anyone who Defended the actions of these young whites, would surely be seen as the biggest racists of all. Perhaps this is the real &#8216;racism&rsquo; in England.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t think for one moment that the &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; don&rsquo;t KNOW the truth.  They are motivated by anti-white hatred, not compassion for others.  That&rsquo;s why so much energy needs to be expended to cover up the truth.</p>
<p>This is one of the things that whites need to get.  This isn&rsquo;t about well meaning idiots who are mistaken about the issue.  This is about an evil group, often satanically motivated, controlled by a specific racial group.  If it were the former, you could debate them, correct them, and shake hands afterward with your new allies.</p>
<p>The latter requires a different strategy.  And it doesn&rsquo;t involve debate.</p>

<p>I think Rod is being sarcastic.That&rsquo;s why Bonnie Greer declares that most paedophiles are White, and all we got was beans on toast and Top Gear.  She&rsquo;s just dismissed hundreds of years of British history, with a glib comment.  She probably sucked her teeth before she said it, and then waggled her head and waved her finger around while saying it. You know how they do it.I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she dropped the favourite Black insult of &#8220;M*********a in there somewhere as well.   And she&rsquo;s a trustee of the British Museum. Diane Abbott is a hypocritical, White hating champagne Socialist, who not so long ago said exactly the same thing as Rod did, and sent her son to an exclusive private school, because she feared for his safety in the state schools in her area.   </p>

<p>-Football hooligans are mostly white, but they beat each other up at football games.  They don&rsquo;t go wilding in black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>-Most pedophiles are likely Muslims and blacks; the many rapes they commit involve underage girls.</p>
<p>-Most murderers are likely Muslims and blacks; murder is often categorized under &#8220;gang violence&#8221; and &#8220;honor killings.&#8221;</p>
<p>-And as for war-mongering&hellip;please define exactly what that is.  If it means calling for or inciting wars, then that top prize goes to Muslims; they are crying &#8220;Jihad!&#8221; all over the world.</p>

		<p>Bonnie Greer&rsquo;s claim the overwhelming majority of paedophiles are white males is not merely a matter of opinion.  It&rsquo;s an empirical claim.  A true journalist would have pressed her to back up her claim with facts and sources.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the figures are for the UK, but I know that leftists in the US will invariably repeat the claim - never backed up - that white males are more likely to commit sex crimes against children.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bogus claim.<br>
See Recidivism of Sex Offenders Released from Prison in 1994, US Department of Justice, p. 14, Table Two. <br>
<a href="/bjs/pub/pdf/rsorp94.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/rsorp94.pdf</a><br>
Blacks made up 21% of child molesters and 25% of statutory rapists even as they comprise only 13% of the population. According to this same report, &#8220;whites&#8221; made up 78% of child molesters and 73% of statutory rapists.  As is well know, when the Department of justice counts identifies perpetrators, it includes mestizos in the category &#8220;white,&#8221; thus skewing the results. </p>

		<p>in the US, blacks are circa 13% of the population, and are responsible for more than half of all violent crimes.</p>
<p>in London, they&rsquo;re about 12% of the population and are responsible for more than half of all violent crimes.</p>
<p>Europeans like to crow about &#8220;violence in America,&#8221; but levels of violence in white enclaves like Vermont are lower than in any European country.</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dealing here with biological constants.</p>
<p>the reason for all of the censorship controls is at the truth is so obvious.</p>
<p>if blacks were not indeed extravagantly violent and responsible for most violent crime, there would be perfectly all right to say that they were, and people would just shrug it off as nonsense.</p>
<p>remember, it&rsquo;s perfectly all right to say the Jews are stupid, that gays have no taste in home décor, that French people know nothing about cuisine, that Puerto Rican speak so darned softly you can barely hear them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the spinelessness which is disgusting. The backing down, and tail between legs attitude. If he isn&rsquo;t a racist, what&rsquo;s gnawing him? If he is against multiculturalism - go make the case!!</p>

		<p>Obviously, the British are where Americans were about a decade ago in regard to race realism.  Because of booming black crime rates, they now must acknowledge that they have a tremendous societal problem.  But cultural liberals there are continuing to deny that which is, on paper and in the streets, obvious to all.  American libs used to do the same thing, until just any citizen could go online and look up the FBI crime stats by race.  The MSM, by and large, still try to &#8220;deny&#8221; it all by avoiding mention of horrendous torture-murders by blacks or by reporting crimes with no mention of race. <br>
And, of course, the reluctance to face facts is not only unfair, but dangerous.  A senator&rsquo;s daughter is naive enough to roll down her window to two scrawny blacks on the streets of D.C. and gets carjacked.  She could have easily been kidnapped, raped, and tortured to death.  (Did she think they were Somali immigrants desperate for food?)  Why would anyone take the chance?  <br>
As to #7&rsquo;s question regarding the British term African-Caribbean:  maybe their main crime problem comes from immigrants and their immediate descendents, rather than the handful of blacks that have lived in the U.K. for generations.</p>

<p>This statement alone sharply identifies him as someone who has been so thoroughly brainwashed he has clearly lost his ability to tell the truth, except when he is forced to do so.</p>
<p>That &#8220;racism&#8221; is something that leads his list of vile things, makes me wonder where he places torture and murder and abject cruelty to defenseless little animals.</p>
<p>My studied opinion is that the man is a total idiot, but the ones criticizing him should not be allowed anywhere within the human population, unless it is the middle of a black community, so they can express their idiotic love of them in between robberies and beatings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said many times that it is not only brainwashing that influences the opinions of people like these, but a desire to be on the right side of history, meaning of course that non-whites will soon dominate.</p>
<p>What a cruel punishment for them if their country collapsed economically and they were set upon by the restless natives they helped import and were denied sanctuary with sane white people everywhere.</p>

		<p>Right, it&rsquo;s just our &#8220;racist&#8221; imagination that black males have a big problem with knocking up women and not taking care of their children. It&rsquo;s just our &#8220;racist&#8221; imagination that the majority of violent crimes such as murder, rape, robbery, assault include a black male as the criminal and a white person as the victim.  But I guess even if liberals and racist black admit that, they&rsquo;ll blame that on slavery and segregation and a million other excuses.  Blacks are not a strong and resilient race.  Any race that whines all the time for stuff, that accuses others of keeping them down, that is very sensitive and violent with differences of racial opinion are not a strong race.  Far, far from it.</p>

		<p>If Dianne Abbott, herself black, had the courage to address the question of exactly which racial group are the main victims and so suffering most from this street crime, knife crime, gun crime, robbery and crimes of sexual violence in London, she would find the &#8216;overwhelming majority&rsquo; are from the African-Caribbean community and then perhaps she would arrive at a &ldquo;statistically true&rdquo; premise that the &#8216;victims&rsquo; look no further than their own family, friends and neighbours to identify the perpetrators. No White person could do this as it would be classed as racist, and as blacks &#8216;don&rsquo;t snitch&rsquo;, then the problem remains unaddressed and self-perpetuating but still overwhelmingly black.</p>

   A strange world this in which we live, where young and old are taught in falsehoods school, and the one man who dare oppose is called a liar and a fool.<br>
    As a judge said so infamously in Leeds &#8220;The truth is no defence&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;In return we have rap music, goat curry and a far more vibrant and diverse understanding of cultures which were once alien to us. For which, many thanks.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah genital mutilation and honour killings have enriched British culture tremendously.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;My response would be to say that the overwhelming majority of paedophiles, murderers, war-mongers and football hooligans are white males and all we got in return was beans on toast and Top Gear.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why is it okay for someone to say that whites commit the majority of crimes involving sexual abuse of minors and serial killings, but it&rsquo;s not okay to say that blacks commit the majority of crimes involving violence?</p>

&#8220;Why is it okay for someone to say that whites commit the majority of crimes involving sexual abuse of minors and serial killings, but it&rsquo;s not okay to say that blacks commit the majority of crimes involving violence?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because whites DO NOT commit the majority of crimes involving sexual abuse of minors and serial killings.&#8221;  Blacks are way out front in sexual abuse of children than any other race as well.  (US Dept of Justice; FBI Uniform Crime Report.)  And the evidence is piling up that blacks have MORE serial killers  &mdash;  -percentagewise  &mdash;    &mdash;  than whites, also.</p>
<p>You use a trick that is common in high school, which is to agree with a premise the majority of your readers believe in order to get in a false derogatory comment about them.</p>
<p>And none of your posts&hellip;.of course&hellip;.has any supporting references.<br>

<p>You are correct.  The reputable stats show that black serial killers, as a percentage of the whole, are slightly more than the black percentage of the U.S. population as a whole.  The only reason why serial killing &#8220;seems&#8221; to be a white crime is that it&rsquo;s one of the few violent crimes where blacks aren&rsquo;t way overrepresented as a percentage of the whole.</p>

		<p>Ice, you&rsquo;re taking what I said out of context and misrepresenting me. I never said that I agree that most serial killers are white, or whatever. I said, Why is it okay for someone to say something like that &mdash; <i>not that I agree with it</i> &mdash; but it&rsquo;s not okay to say the majority of violent criminals are black? That&rsquo;s the point I was trying to make, obviously.</p>
<p>Read my post more thoroughly next time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you made that explanation, because we&rsquo;ve got a poster on here who is rabidly anti-white that does just as I explained.  I can see it was not you.  My error.<br>
 <br>
However, to avoid a misunderstanding you might have better expressed your point of view by saying: &#8220;Why is it okay for someone to &#8220;falsely&#8221; say that whites commit the majority of crimes involving sexual abuse of minors and serial killings, but it&rsquo;s not okay to &#8220;accurately&#8221; say that blacks commit the majority of crimes involving violence?</p>
<p>Incidentally, I agree with your premise.<br>

		<p>Liddle is, on the whole, one of the better journalists working in the UK, which admittedly isn&rsquo;t saying much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth bearing in mind, though, that he operates within the MSM, both as a print journalist and broadcaster, and therefore he clearly feels the need to sugar the pill of truth with (to vary the metaphor) token obeisances before the altar of &#8220;anti-racism&#8221;. If he didn&rsquo;t, he would be blackballed by the NUJ (National Union of Journalists) and his appearances on BBC radio and television would be severely curtailed if not altogether stopped.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly worth visiting his Spectator blog.</p>

		<p>In reply to Mike Harrigan&rsquo;s query:</p>
<p>The ludicrous and misleading term :Afro{or African}/Caribbean<br>
is a sop to the West Indian descended population and will be found on all official forms.A similar term &#8216;Black African&rsquo;exists<br>
to describe Nigerians,Ghanaians etc.The two groups of &#8216;Bruvvers&rsquo;hate the sight of each other and prefer not to be classed together.Racial profiling on forms is also extended to myriad white groups,all except the English,for which it is illegal to describe oneself as.  </p>
