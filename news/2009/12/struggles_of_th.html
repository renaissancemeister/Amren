	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Largely because of the growth of this second generation, Latino immigrants and their U.S.-born children and grandchildren will represent almost a third of the nation&rsquo;s working-age adults by mid-century, according to projections from U.S. Census Bureau data by Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer with the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center in Washington.</p>
<p>Not since the last great wave of immigration to the United States around 1900 has the country&rsquo;s economic future been so closely entwined with the generational progress of an immigrant group. And so far, on nearly every measure, the news is troubling.</p>
<p>Second-generation Latinos have the highest high school dropout rate  &mdash;  one in seven  &mdash;  of any U.S.-born racial or ethnic group and the highest teen pregnancy rate. These Latinos also receive far fewer college degrees and make significantly less money than non-Hispanic whites and other second-generation immigrants.</p>
<p>Their struggles have fueled an outcry for stricter immigration laws, with advocates saying that the rapid increase in Latino immigrants and their children has strained the United States&rsquo; resources and social fabric.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last 30 years of immigration have made our country more unequal, poorer than we would have been otherwise, more fractious and less cohesive,&#8221; said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, which favors tighter restrictions on immigration.</p>
<p>Supporters of Latino immigrants say that the newcomers and their children have spurred economic growth and contribute far more to society than they take from it. They also note that even a complete halt to future immigration would not change the footprint of the 15.5 million U.S.-born offspring of Latino immigrants already in the country.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only yardstick by which the second generation has achieved unambiguous success is the one that has stirred the most public controversy: English proficiency. Despite fears among some people that English usage is diminishing in the Latino community, census data and several studies indicate that by the second generation, nearly all Latinos are fluent in English and that by the third generation, few can even speak Spanish.</p>
<p>The second generation&rsquo;s lack of success on educational and economic fronts is largely explained by their immigrant parents&rsquo; extremely low starting point. Forty percent of second-generation Latino children are born to parents who never completed high school. Only 12 percent have a parent with a college degree or higher.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although adding on a year or two of education beyond high school can boost their incomes, to be truly guaranteed a middle-class lifestyle, second-generation Latinos need at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree  &mdash;  a feat that the last major wave of immigrants, from Eastern and Southern Europe, took three or four generations to achieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second generation is doing way better&#8221; than their parents, said Ruben Rumbaut, a professor at the University of California at Irvine and a leading scholar on second-generation Latino immigrants. &#8220;But way better can still mean they are high school dropouts with 11 years of education, as opposed to their parents, with six years. And in this economy, an 11th-grade dropout is not going to make it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Rigorous and unassailable research has proven that IQ has a very strong genetic component.  Research has also shown that New World Indians (Hispanics) have a relatively low IQ.  Since education does not alter genes, there will be little improvement in academic performance among Hispanics for many generations.  By importing millions of Hispanics into the USA, we are lowering our Nation&rsquo;s average IQ, as well as our future economic viability.</p>

		<p>Newcomers and their children spurred economic growth and contribute far more to society than they take from it? LIARS! Prove it! By all means, give us some examples. How stupid do these people think we are for crying out loud!? How on earth do non-english speaking, unskilled, uneducated illegals contribute to OUR society? I&rsquo;m scared to death for my future grandchildren. I can see me telling them stories of the good ole days, before our country became a third world ghetto.</p>

		<p>This is an interesting phenomenon and contrasts strangely with earlier immigrant groups.</p>
<p>Second generation Jews, Italians, Irish, etc built on the efforts of their parents and generally moved solidly into the middle class (or better) within a generation.</p>
<p>Hispanic immigrants generally work hard, keep their families together, and make a better life for themselves than they left behind.</p>
<p>Strangely, the second generation too often seems to lapse into gang associations, drug use and trafficking, and high levels of criminal behavior in general.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this phenomenon out there?</p>

		<p>It is an absolute lie to claim that only one out of seven second generation Latinos drops out of school.  At Garfield High School in L. A. there are three times as many freshmen as seniors, but they claim only a 22 percent dropout rate.  No, that&rsquo;s a two thirds dropout rate.  And when you see how many pass the exit exam, only about one in ten entering freshmen actually get a diploma.  I am certain that the same sort of fraudulent statistics are used everywhere to make the Mexicans look much, much better than they are.  </p>

		<p>NBJ, poster # 3. I concur with what you said. I have grandchildren and I am scared for what is to happen to them in the &#8220;new&#8221; America. Immigration has been BAD for America (certain groups) for decades before 1965 and especially after that traitorous Immigration Act. That was nothing but an anti-White Immigration Act and now we are reaping the results.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Supporters of Latino immigrants say that the newcomers and their children have spurred economic growth and contribute far more to society than they take from it&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And what economic growth might that be?  In California, the only &#8216;growth&rsquo; contribution from immigrants has been the massive growth of the welfare industry (contributing to California&rsquo;s economic demise).</p>
<p>Townhall reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;California is in desperate fiscal straits because it has become a place where government works for only two constituencies: Those who need public assistance, and unions&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for contributing &#8216;far more to society than they take from it&rsquo;,  the journalist should have immediately countered with this: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Manhattan Institute adjunct fellow Edwin S. Rubenstein&hellip; found that each immigrant costs taxpayers more than $9,000, while every immigrant household of four costs $36,000 in taxes. </p>
<p>Looking at education alone, Rubenstein found that about &#8216;3.8 million public school students &mdash; 7.9% of total K to 12 enrollment &mdash; are enrolled in classes for English language learners,&rsquo; according to Department of Education statistics. These classes are significantly more expensive than mainstream English classes. &hellip; about $3.9 billion ($1,030 times 3.8 million)&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although I give grudging credit to the journalist for at least quoting Mark Krikorian</p>
<p>According to the researcher:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The federal government has never produced a comprehensive study of this issue&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yz6wkjo" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yz6wkjo</a></p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/yzfooa6</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Forty percent of second-generation Latino children are born to parents who never completed high school&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Forty-five percent of latino children are illegitimate.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Second-generation Latinos have the highest high school dropout rate..&#8221;</p>
<p>Third generation latinos who have been in the US for more than three generations are twice as likely as Whites to not have a high school diploma.</p>
<p>The problem is far more serious than a &#8216;language barrier&rsquo; especially as the third generation should have overcome any language barrier by that time.</p>
<p>It is double digit IQs and a disinterest in education that hampers them. </p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer with the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center in Washington&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does anyone here believe an organization with the name &#8216;Pew Hispanic Center&rsquo; to be nonpartisan? </p>

		<p>4 John: The second generation declines because whatever the Hispanics failings, they live in societies shaped by and adapted to those failings.  Bring them to America, where they by and large cannot adapt to White norms, and offer them ghetto culture and government-backed racial Marxism, and watch as the hard working peon becomes a cholo.  </p>

		<p>Second and third generation latino imigrants, when are white or predominantly white, usually merge in the european population. As a conseuqence they are not considered spanish. Second and third generation latino imigrants  who stay latinos are, most of the time, mixed people with a predominance of indian gens.   </p>

		<p>The &#8220;second generation&#8221; is already making its mark in our community. One teenager (a 15 year old illegal) dropped a chunk of concrete from a highway overpass and decapitated a local university professor, while another (17 year old) was drunk driving and killed a young girl only about 3 blocks from my home. Additionally our jail is rapidly filling with latino drug runners, gangbangers, and sex offenders. Our community is not even considered to have a large population of latinos, maybe less that 2%!</p>
<p>JUST WAIT UNTIL THE POPULATION REACHES 30%!!!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t diversity wonderful?</p>

<p> Ditto on everything.  However, I&rsquo;d add to &#8220;Cheap yard labor vs. gang violence? Tacos vs. welfare? Day labor help at Home Depot vs. child rape?&#8221; - Handing out porno to passers-by on the Vegas strip vs. drunk driving, vehicular homicide and uninsured unlicensed drivers. </p>

		<p>The answer to your question, John, is that hispanic parents come here looking for any job, and are willing to pick vegetables because that life is better than anything they could have in Mexico - especially given free health care through hospital ERs and free schooling.  The problem is, they drag their kids along with them, or have kids here.  Their KIDS didn&rsquo;t come here to work.  They are just HERE.  As soon as they can, they drop out of school and go onto &#8220;other pursuits&#8221;.  The whole demographic of illegal immigrants is a huge strain on all public services from health care to prisons.  They need to be forced back into their own countries, and our borders need to be defended by force if necessary, not left wide open.  Employers who hire illegals should be prosecuted and licenses denied them forever after.</p>

		<p>immigrants are always full of hope, it takes a generation before the kids from less gifted groups realize they are well into the lower quartile mentally in their new country. </p>
<p>quotas or no quoats, they are the losers.<br>
 <br>
same w/ muslims in europe, most of whom are simply not competitive given their mental development.</p>
<p>most end up on welfare or in menial occupations and full of resentment.</p>
<p>all should stay in their own countries and work to improve them.</p>
<p>all of this is painfully obvious, but must be denied in favor of elaborate rube goldberg explanations.</p>
<p>until white people wake up, that is. </p>

		<p>As a former public schoolteacher, I know firsthand that first generation Mexicans almost never become fluent in English.  First generation Asians from any country become fluent within a year.  Mexicans don&rsquo;t want to learn English; they want to take all they can from the USA and remain Mexican.  However, Hispanics from other countries, like Guatamala, Honduras, El Salvador, etc., are generally very hard workers right from the first generation, they learn English quickly, and do much better in school than their Mexican counterparts.  I say keep the Central Americans and send the Mexicans home - if Mexico is so great, go home - they have no business taking from our country.</p>

		<p>How can they.  Hispanic&rsquo;s have, on average, very low IQ&rsquo;s.  That is one thing that is not going to change, no matter how many generations are here.  The one thing that will raise the IQ level for this group is inter-marriage with those that have IQ&rsquo;s at least 100 or above.  If you want to keep the Hispanic&rsquo;s at bay (considering the Government will not send them back), tell your children not to marry them.</p>
