<h1><a href="https://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=872380">Suit Says College Singled Out Blacks</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Waldman, Times Union (Albany), December 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former dean of the State University of New York at Cobleskill has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the school, saying it discriminated against black students by keeping them in school for their tuition dollars when administrators knew they had no chance of earning a degree.</p>
<p>Thomas Hickey, who was stripped of his position as dean of liberal arts and sciences in July, filed the federal lawsuit on Nov. 23. In it, he claims the school has been admitting students it knows have no likelihood of graduating &#8220;for the express and admitted purpose of making budget,&#8221; according to court records.</p>
<p>Hickey, who is a tenured professor, said the school targeted black students from the New York City region who did not meet the admissions standards of the college. Hickey said Anne Myers, the school&rsquo;s provost and vice president for academic affairs, developed the discriminatory policy, knew it was harmful to students and resisted the development of remedial programs that could have given the African-American students in question a chance to succeed.</p>
<p>In the suit, Hickey claims Myers expressed to the faculty that such students were &#8220;not cognitively and genetically prepared&#8221; to function in the college. Myers told him, &#8220;I do not care about these people,&#8221; court records show.</p>
<p>Myers consistently lowered the academic threshold so that all students would pass and move on to the next year of study, the suit claims.</p>
<p>Hickey said the academic threshold started at a 2.0 grade point average and then was reduced to 1.0, which Myers said was necessary because of the budget.</p>
<p>The lawsuit cites a response to that move from Thomas Cronin, a physics professor, who wrote that one of Cobleskill&rsquo;s &#8220;worst offenses&#8221; was admitting and re-admitting students incapable of achieving a college degree, who subsequently go into debt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Phillip Steck, the attorney representing Hickey, said his client has evidence including memorandums, e-mails and witness statements to support his claims. He also said his client can produce a written policy from the school that supports such discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In March, a faculty member investigated the claims and found that the school had different admissions requirements for different populations of students, according to the suit. It asserts that black students academic records were falsified to assist in their admission. Hickey, who came to the school in 2006, said Cobleskill was using tuition from black students to subsidize money-losing agricultural programs that cater almost exclusively to white students.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more like for making racial quotas.</p>
<p><i>The lawsuit cites a response to that move from Thomas Cronin, a physics professor, who wrote that one of Cobleskill&rsquo;s &ldquo;worst offenses&rdquo; was admitting and re-admitting students incapable of achieving a college degree, who subsequently go into debt.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the college and university system is for the most part community organizers and youth auxiliaries of the Democrat Party.  When Democrats are in power in government, they do things like increase grant programs, lower student loan rates.  This means that potential college students have more money to go to college, which means that colleges can raise tuition, which means the students incur more debt.  But it&rsquo;s more money through academia, some of which I&rsquo;m sure makes its way back to Democrat campaign coffers.  If not that, then there&rsquo;s a ready made supply of mind-numbed Democrat/left robots with sociology and feminist and Ebonics degrees, to work on Democrat campaigns.</p>
<p>A sensible education policy would be to offer secondary public education in the way the student can absorb, and not automatically assume that it&rsquo;s a civil right or birthright or patriotic duty to go to college.</p>

		<p>LOL&hellip;Oh my! I wonder what the black students of this school are thinking. &#8221; Why you didn&rsquo;t tell me I was too stupid to get my degree!? &#8221; Give my money back! Wow.. a lawsuit filed on behalf of<br>
blacks being discriminated against because they lack the intellect to earn a degree. This has to be a first!</p>

		<p>There is something fishy about this article.  Is the guy who filed the lawsuit black and looking for lottery money?  It is demanded of colleges that blacks have to be let in and be allowed to graduate otherwise it is discrimination.  In order to do this, the standards have to be greatly lowered.  One get dammed both ways from the looks of this article.<br>

		<p>This seems silly to me. If those spots were given to successful white students the same amount of tuition revenue would still be coming in. The admissions are malicious are discriminatory not against the admitted blacks but against the whites who were not let in. College administrators nationwide are more committed to the fantasy of diversity than to academic excellence. They need to admit hopeless blacks as window dressing for the diversity facade.</p>

If true, the school gave blacks what they wanted; a chance.</p>

		<p>Any halfway decent institute of higher learning wouldn&rsquo;t need failing students, of any race, to stay afloat, because there would be plenty of wait-listed students just chomping at the bit to fill those vacated slots. </p>
<p>The fact that CUNY has neither the endowment nor enough qualified applicants to otherwise make their budget, says a lot more about CUNY than about students of any particular race.</p>

		<p>I achieved my BA in history from SUNY. I plan on going back for a graduate level degree someday :(, but I recall a significant proportion of blacks at my school, none of whom were in any of my classes. I think they all majored in &#8216;African Studies&rsquo;. There were one or two black professors who dressed in that Afrocentric clown garb and stalked around with chips on their shoulders. I also remember the ethnic dances: Black dances, Hispanic dances, &#8216;Asian Occasions&rsquo;&hellip;. all for the sake of diversity. There were also the usual race suicide white leftist who ranted and raved about the cause of the week. One day they barricaded all the doors on one of the buildings to protest sweatshops or some other trivia. At first it looked like I was going to be trapped inside, but I forced open one of the doors and swinging my pack I made it to my next class, leaving a couple of lesbians sprawled on the pavement. For some reason I never faced any consequences for this. </p>

		<p>Good for Professor Hickey.  The bottom line is that the law school industry is preying upon the hopes and dreams of many young people, black and white.  If you get into a school ranked among the top 15 or so, it is a good deal.  You will do okay in a top 50 school as long as you graduate in the top quarter or so.  Otherwise, you will not find legal employment and you will have wasted perhaps 100K.</p>
<p>So why do people keep going to law school?  Because the schools publish fraudulent employment and salary statistics to attract applicants.  The scam works like this.  You publish an &#8220;average salary&#8221; of 125K.  The fine print says that this is the average for the grads that report.  Later, you realize that the top ten percent of the class makes $160,000, public defenders and small firm attorneys make 50,000, and the bottom half of the class couldn&rsquo;t find any legal job at all and are working retail or waiting tables.  They don&rsquo;t report their salaries because they are ashamed and embarrassed.  Law school makes people believe that if they can&rsquo;t find a job its THEIR fault, when in fact there are no jobs out there.</p>
<p>In some very low-ranked schools, it is standard practice to flunk out a third of the class after first year.  That way, you collect their tuition money, but since they never actually graduate and take the bar, they don&rsquo;t drag down your bar passage statistics.  It is evil and corrupt to the core.  </p>
<p>Its sad that in order to get an injustice noticed and rectified, you have to turn it into a racial issue that disproportionately hurts blacks, but in this case, whatever it takes to bring down these crooks is a good thing.</p>
<p>This video sums it up nicely:</p>

		<p>I have been predicting this development for some time now!</p>
<p>First, blacks sued banks for not giving them mortgages. Then, when they couldn&rsquo;t repay, they sued the same banks for &#8220;predatory lending&#8221;   &mdash;   giving them mortgages the bank should have known they couldn&rsquo;t repay.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;ll do the same thing to colleges.  First they sued because not enough black students were being admitted.  Now they&rsquo;ll sue because these same unqualified black students dropped out before earning a degree, but still owing huge tuition loans.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it &#8220;Predatory Admissions!&#8221; </p>
<p>The irony is that the real beneficiaries of Affirmative Action are the white students displaced by unqualified blacks.  The rejected white students go to community college for the first year or two, saving on tuition.  Then they transfer into the more prestigeous college filling the slot left open by the black dropout, getting a prestigeous degree at a lower overall price. </p>
<p>(Just &#8220;The Man,&#8221; keeping you down!)</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right.  A high percentage of lawyers who have passed the bar, perhaps near a majority if not slightly higher, aren&rsquo;t in practice because there&rsquo;s just not the work.  Of lawyers that do practice, the average one makes less money than the U.S. Post Office letter carrier that delivers mail to his or her home.  And if insurance companies didn&rsquo;t hassle around with claims made after car bang-em-ups, the most of those lawyers actually practicing would have to leave the field.</p>

<p>I went to a state land grant(Ag)college.  Very few blacks.  Great college experience.  In the spring of my Junior year there was a protest by black students who attended the university&rsquo;s (traditionally) black undergraduate college protesting my college&rsquo;s admission policies.  The following year they let in a group of &#8220;underprivileged&#8221; students.  I graded papers for a professor who taught a world agricultural problems survey course.  These kids could not put together a single coherent sentence.  It was sad.<br>

		<p>12 Q.D: I&rsquo;ve read that many people with law degrees end up with some some of administrative/clerical job that used to be done by smart high school grads.  I knew a couple factory contract administrators, people who made sure that the job met the terms agreed upon, who retired and were replaced by lawyers.   The new hires were paid less than the high school grads they replaced.  It seems that for many employers, a law degree is nothing more than evidence that the prospective employee is probably literate, like the high school diploma used to be.  </p>

		<p>9 Sofita: It&rsquo;s not just law schools that run these sorts of scams.  My worthless nephew was allowed to be a professional student for about 15 years, slowly dragging himself through a B.A. (6 years), an M.A. (4 years), and five or six years of a PhD program, Everything But Dissertation is the expression.  (His excuse for finally dropping out was that it was vitally important to work for Obama&rsquo;s campaign.  Worthless, like I said.)  I wondered how so deeply ignorant (He owns NO books?!) a man could get so far, and asked a couple professors I know if any college would ever hire someone like him.  They both laughed and explained how profitable it can be to take advantage of grad students and leave them without a degree and owing tens of thousands in student loans.  The professors know who the real students are and who are the milch cows.  </p>

		<p>Institutions of higher learning want anybody who can pay, whether it be rich foreigners or minorities who use affirmative action grants or student loans (which they may well not be willing or able to repay).  What is most interesting here is the statement that some of these students are not &#8220;cognitively and genetically prepared&#8221; for study at the university.  What a &#8220;raciss&#8221; thing to say!</p>

<p>Good post elitist. My wife is involved with a charity group and she tells me they&rsquo;re running into a lot of &#8220;educated&#8221; White College graduates needing help now.

I&rsquo;m not so sure that we can say with complete accuracy that Blacks are victims when it comes to their student loan debt. Does anybody care to guess (or supply facts) as to how much of that debt incurred by the subject population in this article is actually repaid??</p>

<p>Just through the powers of observation and talking to a few lawyers did I come to understand these things.  But even before I was able to understand this, I was against most proposals for &#8220;tort reform,&#8221; because lawsuits and the threat of lawsuits tend to make big corporations behave without the need to cut down every tree in the world to have enough paper to print Federal regulations.  Later on, I found out that the insurance industry and the Republican politicians they bought are the real forces behind tort reform.  But there are good tort reform proposals out there; they wouldn&rsquo;t get consideration from either party.</p>
<p>Missouri&rsquo;s Governor from 2000 to 2004 was a reptilian faced creep by the name of Bob Holden (Democrat).  The same day he was elected, before he was elected, the Republicans took control of the State Senate.  In the middle of his term, they took over the State House.  For the two legislative sessions that Rs ran the General Assembly and Holden was Governor, they sent him TR bill after TR bill which he rightly vetoed.  He took the most heat for vetoing a medical malpractice TR bill, and came out and said that the real villain why doctors&rsquo; medical malpractice insurance is so high is the evil cartel-like actions of the insurance industry, and they essentially owned the GOP.  Holden was defeated in his own party&rsquo;s primary in 2004, by someone you might have heard of:  Claire McCaskill.  She lost to Matt Blunt (R) that November, and he went on to sign TR, and about a fifth of MO&rsquo;s lawyers went out of business in earnest.  Of course, Holden was against CCW, but Republicans had a better than 2-to-1 margin in the Senate when Holden vetoed a CCW bill, so the Senate overrode his veto, and MO has CCW today.</p>
<p>In Australia, the cost of liability insurance for automobiles is low because when you register a car to get its plates, it costs a lot of money, but liability is built in.  Something like that ought to be done here, and that would mean that everybody driving a legit car has liability, no more going to fly by night corner agents, getting a month, showing that to the driver license office, then letting it drop after a month.  (Which a certain minority is known to do.)  And public auto liability insurance would be far less likely to hassle you when a claim is filed.  Apply that to medical malpractice, i.e. build it into the cost of a medical license, and doctors will be a lot better off.</p>

		<p>Sofita, I&rsquo;m a small town lawyer and I&rsquo;m doing okay, although I notice my standard of living is lower than my parents, who were able to go to Europe every year.  I can&rsquo;t afford to do anything like that, but I&rsquo;m solvant.  My main complaint is that I have to work like a dog to do it.  I haven&rsquo;t have a vacation in three (3) years.  <br>
I&rsquo;m solvant because I never got married and I don&rsquo;t have children.  I probably couldn&rsquo;t afford a normal &#8220;family life.&#8221;  I blame the government for that.  If they didn&rsquo;t take so much money from me, I&rsquo;d have an extra $1500 to $2000 a month, and I would have a family and produce little taxpayers who would contribute to society.  But I can&rsquo;t afford it, so the government can replacement me and my potential children with a bunch of welfare children.  We&rsquo;ll see how that works out for the government.  And there&rsquo;s plenty of people like me  &mdash;  our mantra is, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t reproduce in captivity.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;It seems that for many employers, a law degree is nothing more than evidence that the prospective employee is probably literate, like the high school diploma used to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, when it comes to law-related jobs like &#8220;contract administrator&#8221;, a law degree can be a real hindrance.  The hiring manager may feel that the applicant is not only overqualified for the job, but in fact is a threat because the applicant is more qualified for the hiring manager&rsquo;s job than the hiring manager is.  This is the kind of devastation that can result from a non-elite law degree: fewer job prospects, huge debts.  Its brutal.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Does anybody care to guess (or supply facts) as to how much of that debt incurred by the subject population in this article is actually repaid??&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, since these loans are guaranteed by the government for repayment, does anybody care to guess as to how much of your tax burden goes to paying off the unpaid debt from Minorities who failed to graduate?</p>
<p>Not only does an Affirmative-Action college admittance bump your child out, but then you also have to pay for that Affirmative-Action student.  Each White citizen is raising 2 children: his/her own, and a Minority child, supported by government social programs.</p>

		<p><i>How has Hickey been hurt by the admission policy of the school? I do not see that he has any standing to file a suit.</i></p>
<p>Frank   &mdash;  in the complaint, he alleges that he was fired because he spoke up about &#8220;racial discrimination,&#8221; so he&rsquo;s making it into a speech issue.  The &#8220;discriminatory practice&#8221; he alleges, however, is nothing more than an garden variety affirmative action program, of the kind the Supreme Court has upheld in the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine how a black student, as opposed to a white student, could possibly allege an injury here anyways.  Is being admitted to a school for which you lack the requisite qualifications a &#8220;harm,&#8221; legally speaking?  Impossible   &mdash;   all they gave you was an offer, one for which you applied!  The GPA issue, boiled down, seems to be that the college harmed blacks by <i>not kicking them out.</i>  Again, no injury.  They could have withdrawn on their own.  Plus, the standard was lowered for everyone.  </p>

		<p>Dear Post # 25,</p>
<p>I agree with you.  When I add up all the taxes, including property, gas, tolls, utility tax, sales taxes, car registration, SS, Medicare, etc., it comes to nearly 50% of my income.  The government says that they need all of my money to pay for my future retirement and medical care.  However, if the government didn&rsquo;t take so much of my money, I would be able to save enough for my old age   &mdash;   I could have taken care of myself. It is really a form of bondage!</p>
<p>Also, people complain about declining birth rates, but if I had been more secure about my future earnings, I would have had kids earlier and had more kids.  But, at the time, I dare not risk having a large family on my low salary and high tax-burden.  By keeping Whites on the edge, the government causes low White birth rates. </p>
<p>This is not a problem for minorities, because they know that the government will take care of their kids, and they don&rsquo;t mind their kids having a low standard of living.  The media fosters White guilt, with &#8220;feel-good&#8221; movies showing White families adopting Black kids.  The message they send is that it is the moral duty for Whites to provide for Blacks.  Meanwhile, 75% of Black kids are born without a father.  </p>

		<p>I read a while back that 90% of students who go to university never finish a degree. When asked why students were let in when the university knew they would never pass the usual reply was because they had to give them a chance as they managed to get university entrance; the possibility that one might finish, no matter how remote, means that everyone who gets to university needs to be given the chance to pass or fail.</p>
<p>It may seem like a waste of resources but if universities raised the bar for who gets in or not classes would have to be cut and professors would have to be let go or else the university would go broke.</p>

<p>I assume that you meant to say 90% of Blacks that enter college fail to obtain a degree.  I&rsquo;m not sure that it is that high, but it is close.  For Whites, I think that above 25% who enter college never finish.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a money making deal for the lower tier universities. They admit huge numbers of minority students who were passed along by the take-the-easy-way-out high schools knowing they are most unlikely to make it to senior year. They will tell you it is just to give them a last chance but it makes the university big bucks and keeps the faculty employed. </p>

		<p>When disqualified Blacks are told they are not qualified for college, they cry, &#8220;Racism!&#8221;</p>
<p>Consequently, special exceptions are made for them. Standards are lowered. Their grades and all considerations based on merit are ignored. They are allowed to attend and pass without any effort whatsoever, because they are Black and they lack the intelligence necessary to meet the most minimum requirements and standards (even the lowered ones!), which is exactly what the lawsuit states. </p>
<p>Moreover, deserving Whites are denied admission so that Blacks can masquerade as students at the expense of White taxpayers! What an abhorrent crime!</p>
<p>Consider the facts: </p>
<p>When Blacks are told, &#8220;You do not meet the most minimum standards and you are not qualified,&#8221; they cry &#8220;RACISM!&#8221; </p>
<p>When Blacks are told, &#8220;Okay, we&rsquo;re going to waive all academic admission standards and qualifications to allow you to attend school,&#8221; they scream, &#8220;RACISM! PREDATORY ADMISSION!&#8221;</p>
<p>When Blacks are told, &#8220;You have very poor credit, no income, and you do not meet the minimum standards for a home or car loan,&#8221; they cry, &#8220;RACISM!&#8221; </p>
<p>When Blacks are told, &#8220;Okay, we&rsquo;re going to waive all standards and qualifiers and grant you a loan because your ancestors may have been slaves, they wail, &#8220;RACISM! PREDATORY LENDING!&#8221;</p>
<p>See the pattern, my friends? Blacks are in the permanent custodial care of Whites! Period! There is absolutely no way to achieve an honest outcome when Blacks are involved. </p>
<p>President Lincoln was absolutely correct in attempting to repatriate all Blacks back to Africa (Liberia Project). Congress was correct in supporting him, but wrong in not funding the project properly. Is it too late to make up for a 160 year old error?</p>
<p>I think Blacks would be better off in their natural habitat without the demands of civilization acting as a burden to them.</p>
<p>I know that Whites would be far better off without them in our midsts. Society would greatly improve in many, many tangible, measurable ways!</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a bad idea actually, if it wasn&rsquo;t FOR lawyers, we wouldn&rsquo;t NEED lawyers and a man would have to keep his word, integrity and honor or suffer the consequences. Blacks would have no lottery to win either, so overall, a win win situation to me.</p>

		<p>What is most interesting here is the statement that some of these students are not &ldquo;cognitively and genetically prepared&rdquo; for study at the university. What a &ldquo;raciss&rdquo; thing to say!</p>
<p>Like it or not olewhitelady, this statement is very true, as is the first part of your post. I have pointed out a number of times that a college is a BUSINESS, as is a HOSPITAL, and both need to show a profit now matter how. If a person with an IQ of .7 can pay tuition, he/she looks better to that business than another with no ability to pay but IQ of 165.</p>

		<p>The following year they let in a group of &ldquo;underprivileged&rdquo; students. I graded papers for a professor who taught a world agricultural problems survey course. These kids could not put together a single coherent sentence. It was sad.</p>
<p>I work overseas and often have to look at resumes for positions paying more, sometimes WAY more than $100,000 tax free annual and I see the same problem, especially with the usual protected species and they get &#8220;round filed&#8221;:)</p>

		<p>I am a State University of New York alumni myself and I agree 100 percent with this article that they allow in waaaay to many unqualified students. I disagree that it is unfair to blacks though, the tuition is mostly paid by the tax payer as all the public colleges and universities in New York are highly subsidized and the actual tuition is nominal.</p>
<p>If anything, the blacks are the ones bilking the government for refusing to make the slightest effort to pass the most watered down, feel good, college curricula ever seen. With the liberal arts majors, if you can just roll out of bed in the morning and have a class attendance rate north of 50 percent, and it is virtually impossible to get less than a B.</p>
