<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34213954/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/">Cops: Sharpton Daughter Said She Was in Rush</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, November 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Rev. Al Sharpton&rsquo;s daughter told a police officer in a profanity-laden rant that she cut him off in traffic because she was in a rush to get to a theater, prosecutors said Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were driving too slow. I have a play to go to,&#8221; Dominique Sharpton told an officer who pulled her over Oct. 30, prosecutors told a Manhattan judge.</p>
<p>Dominique Sharpton and the civil rights activist&rsquo;s ex-wife, Kathy, face charges including resisting arrest after the Harlem traffic stop.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said Dominique Sharpton veered out of her lane, ran a red light and forced another car to swerve out of her way. After being ticketed, she and her mother cursed at the officers, ignored orders to return to their cars and resisted being handcuffed, according to a criminal complaint. Kathy Sharpton pushed an officer with her hands, police said in the complaint.</p>
<p>Hardy said he would ask the court to dismiss the charges, all misdemeanors or violations, calling them &#8220;frivolous&#8221; and saying there were no grounds for the arrest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The top charges are punishable by up to a year in jail.</p>

		<p>Race and genetics speak for themselves now don&rsquo;t they? In this case, a lack of civility and impule control.</p>
<p> Really, what happened with Sharpton&rsquo;s daughter could of been black- anyone USA. Drama like this happens all the time.</p>
<p>Lets see&hellip; you cut-off a policeman run a red light, cuss him out and shove him and think nothing will become of it.</p>
<p>Racial differences between whites &amp; blacks in IQ, disposition and personality is a subject matter worthy of significant research.</p>

		<p> Al baby: &#8220;&hellip;&hellip;questioning &#8220;how two unarmed women with no record could be taken in cuffs from a traffic dispute with NO personal or property damage involved,&#8221; nor any allegations of drug use or drinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called resisting arrest without violence, disorderly conduct, indecent conduct and a few other things I can&rsquo;t think of right now.</p>
<p>You know how it goes, Al.  Blacks must have special privileges in all things.</p>

<p>But when you think you&rsquo;re black, famous, rich, politically connected (especially with friends in the White House) then you can do whatever you want. You&rsquo;re the &#8220;elite&#8221;.  Well, you think!</p>

		<p>Humm..I can&rsquo;t help but wonder about the race of the arresting officer. Surely he is black or there would have been marches organized by now protesting the actions of the white racist cop.</p>
<p>One would think that people of any race would know better than to behave in such a manner towards cops. It&rsquo;s a no win situation to argue with or curse them. But then again, look who we are talking about here. She being Al Sharpton&rsquo;s daughter explains a lot.</p>

Another true-life example of &#8216;driving while black&rsquo; except in this case, we get to see how these incidents really play out.</p>
<p>Guilty, not for being black, but for being rude, vulgar, offensive, obnoxious, and demanding. Oh wait, this is being guilty of being black.</p>
<p>Never mind.</p>

		<p>I say this calls for another beer fest at the White House.  President Obama can invite Sharpton&rsquo;s daughter, ex-wife and the police officers to sit down and have a beer together. Problem solved.</p>

		<p>I lived in New York City during the brutal years of 1985-91.</p>
<p>I note with some pride that the NYPD did not back away from the worst of the NW/Black criminals, trouble makers, mobs - mouthing off to a White NYPD officer still gets the NW taken in, taken down a notch.</p>
<p>This is an area where Whites must do the basics - support tough, honest White cops.</p>

		<p>Yet another missed opportunity to tase those who most deserve it. So I guess it&rsquo;s &#8220;frivolous&#8221; to put other peoples lives at risk? The self-important apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree.</p>

<p>You know NBJ, you may have something there!  She Big Al&rsquo;s daughter so that&rsquo;s pretty high up in the Affirmative Actionacracy and of course holding blacks accountable for their actions is automatic racism. I guess separate really is equal!  </p>

		<p>I wonder if there is a tape? Most cops have a tape rolling when they make a traffic stop. I would be wonderful to see this spoiled daughter going off. </p>
