			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Winton, Los Angeles Times, December 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Men&rsquo;s Central Jail has been on lockdown since Friday evening after the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department learned that inmates were plotting violence.</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s officials said they placed the downtown jail  &mdash;  known for holding the most dangerous inmates  &mdash;  on lockdown after discovering that some prisoners were planning a racial brawl.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Violence between black and Latino inmates has been a problem at the jail.</p>
<p>Since it opened just east of downtown Los Angeles 44 years ago, the Men&rsquo;s Central Jail has been the scene of many of the jail system&rsquo;s most disturbing incidents, including nine inmate homicides between 2000 and 2007. {snip}</p>

		<p>Is this and dozens of other black/Hispanic clashes what the black/Hispanic leadership means when they say people of color are all on the same side?</p>
<p>And, does anybody think they will stop saying that before or after the armed conflicts begin?</p>

		<p> Of course segregating the prisoners by race would eliminate most of the violence. But that&rsquo;s much too sensible and logical an idea for the pillars of wisdom who run this country. A few years ago a prisoner (black, of course) challenged in court a California prison policy with elements of racial segregation. Of course, he found a lunk-headed bleeding heart appeals court that agreed with him. So now the California prison system is forced to mix &#8216;em up racially, then watch the fur fly. Do we have wise leaders, or what? </p>

		<p>Having been a frequent &#8220;visitor&#8221; to this facility in the early 70s I know about this place. One used to have to get within a couple of blocks to see the building and it was designed to hold 5000 people on weekend overload&hellip;.NOW! the thing will hold 35,000 people and that info came from my last personal visit to the place in 84&rsquo; The place is now visible for miles and miles from the North and is a magnet for all sorts of people and this hooplah of race problems is not new here, been in more than a few of the squabbles, kniffings, beatings and the ever popular, throw him over the rail entertainments (in some areas, a 3 story fall to polished cement) effective but messy.</p>

		<p>EVERYBODY knew this was going to happen. Including Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor. She was the one that ordered the integration after the authorities in LA had determined for years that segregating the inmates was the only way to go.</p>
<p>Anyone injured in a racial brawl should sue Sandra in civil court for having helped to establish a climate that led to the injury sustained as part of a racial brawl. A brawl that would have been averted if segregation had been allowed. Can this be done? Sue a retired Supreme Court justice for rulings that helped to establish a climate? Establish a precedent. A precedent cannot be set until a precedent is set?</p>

		<p>Even if all the prisoners were separated by race, given separate rec areas and more, there would still be lots of violence, most of it from the usuals. The latinos here in CA, most of them Mexican, have lots of different gangs that do in fact fight with each other in the jails and prisons. La Eme (the Mexican Mafia) fights with Nuestra Familia. The Nortenos and Surenos (North and South - used to be N or S Mexico but now it also stands for N or S California) fight with each other and everyone else) and all the street gangs fight with each other. The Mexican Mafia only exerts so much authority, not as much as the media claims. The blacks fight each other all the time, the Crips, Bloods, BGF (Black Guerilla Family) and more are always going at it. The African and Central and South American gang members are tribal in the most primitive sense of the word. Keep in mind without contact with whites, these peoples would still be in the jungles, fighting with each other. </p>
