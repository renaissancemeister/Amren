<p>Leonard Zeskind&rsquo;s Blood and Politics is a history of the White Nationalist movement from 1974 to 2004. Although I have owned a copy since its publication in May, I have only recently sat down and read it cover to cover. It has received multiple reviews (from within and without the racialist community) which contain a fairly accurate summary of its contents.</p>
<p>The book tracks the evolution of old fashioned Jim Crow &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; into modern White Nationalism over a thirty year period. In presenting his case, Zeskind draws an analytical division between &#8220;vanguardists&#8221; and &#8220;mainstreamers,&#8221; radicals and respectables, reformers and revolutionaries that has characterized the modern pro-White movement since its earliest days.</p>
<p>The &#8220;mainstreamers&#8221; believe in moderation and an electoral path to victory. The vanguardists believe in creating small, often violent organizations of the elect few and waiting for a general social/economic collapse. Throughout the narrative, Zeskind uses the stories of William Pierce (revolutionary) and Willis Carto (reformer) to illustrate these two conflicting tendencies within the movement.</p>
<p>Blood and Politics is comprehensive in scope. Zeskind runs through every imaginable sector of the pro-White movement: Klan, Neo-Nazi, Creator, Christian Identity (one-seed and dual-seed), Christian patriot, Neo-Confederate, White Nationalist, Council of Conservative Citizens, skinhead, revisionist, militia/paramilitary, underground terrorist, paleocon, race realist, and populist. He does an excellent job of illustrating how racialists drift through one or more of these cross-pollinating subcultures. Everyone from Francis Parker Yockey and Louis Beam to Tim McVeigh and Erich Gliebe is mentioned at some point or another.</p>
<p>For an Ashkenazi Jew, I dare say that Blood and Politics is objective in tone, almost scholarly even. To be sure, Zeskind writes in a Jewish anti-racist voice and can&rsquo;t resist the occasional humanist quip, but his account of the White Nationalist movement is surprisingly free of the usual boilerplate. I found it informative, profited from reading it, and expect others will as well. If I had to level any specific criticism, I would say that Zeskind sacrifices depth for scope. He skips around from one sector of the movement to another in two or three pages.</p>
<p>The Gen Y racialist will find Blood and Politics somewhat familar, yet profoundly alien. This is very much the history of another generation of racialists: its leaders, organizations, strategies, rhetoric, feuds, triumphs and tragedies. Over the past few months, I found myself picking it up and putting it back down. I immediately read the few bits that interested me: Duke&rsquo;s political campaigns, Taylor and Amren, Pierce and the National Alliance, The Bell Curve controversy, Buchanan and Sam Francis. I had to force myself to read the parts that did not. Later, I reflected on my new interest in sectors of the movement I had previously ignored.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of &#8220;leaderless resistance&#8221; before? Have you ever seen racialists using strange numeric codes like 14/88 or 33/5?  What about acronyms like &#8220;Z.O.G.&#8221; and &#8220;O.R.I.O.N.&#8221; or slogans like &#8220;White Pride World Wide&#8221; and &#8220;RAWOHA?&#8221; Have you ever heard vague references to the Fort Smith trial, the Northwest territorial imperative, or a gang of Aryan bankrobbers known as The Order? Can you explain the difference between one-seed and dual-seedline Christian Identity? In Blood and Politics, you will learn all about this and much more.</p>
<p>Be warned. This is not a story about the last decade. The internet hardly figures at all into Zeskind&rsquo;s narrative. Blood and Politics has sixty chapters, but not a single one about Stormfront, the largest website in the movement. Instead, Zeskind focuses on Don Black in his days as a Klansman, the jail time he served for plotting the invasion of Dominica, and his role in the defunct Populist Party. Alex Linder and VNN are nowhere to be found, but Glenn Miller and the White Patriot Party are discussed at length. There is no mention of Kevin MacDonald. The proliferation of vBulletin discussion forums in the 2000&rsquo;s  &mdash;  the critical nodal point for Gen Y contact with the White Nationalist movement  &mdash;  is also ignored.</p>
<p>Blood and Politics is not about us. We were teenagers in the Clinton years. Under George W. Bush, we went to college, developed political opinions, graduated and entered the workforce. Some of us admired Dr. Pierce and tuned into ADV radio broadcasts. A few of us joined the National Alliance in its final days as a viable organization. We frequently read Pat Buchanan, Steve Sailer and Sam Francis at VDARE, created or joined online racialist forums, tuned into and laughed at Goyfire, subscribed to American Renaissance or The Occidental Quarterly, but never followed the travails of Willis Carto. We tend to be white collar atheists or pagans with an HBD-informed view of racial differences and a Kevin MacDonald take on the Jewish Question.</p>
<p>To say the least, this period of movement history (1974-2004) is strange, but important seeds were sown in this bleak period. I can&rsquo;t resist comparing it to the Dark Ages. In a manner of speaking, it followed the Roman Empire but preceeded the Renaissance. I think of David Lane who considered himself a latter day Viking, or Robert Miles, Louis Beam and Tom Metzger who thought Whites were over-civilized and could use a little Aryan barbarism. The violent, tattooed, beer soaked skinheads (the barbarians) represented a tremendous decline from courtly Southern segregationists (Roman patricians). Racialist discourse degenerated like Old Latin into dire warnings about black helicopters, the New World Order, and &#8220;Z.O.G.&#8221; From Race and Reason to the Aryan Nations theory that Jews are the genetic spawn of Satan to The Bell Curve. That&rsquo;s the theme of Blood and Politics.</p>
<p>But there is another side of the story. In 1972, Wilmot Robertson published The Dispossessed Majority, a pathbreaking work that pointed the way forward. In 1992, he published The Ethnostate, a seminal contribution to an emerging White Nationalism. Revilo P. Oliver was active in this period. Dr. Pierce thundered against the Jews from a West Virginia mountainside. David Duke encouraged his followers to ditch their Klan robes and Stormtrooper uniforms. Jared Taylor appeared on the scene and restored a little class and literacy to the pro-White movement. Herrnstein and Murray picked up Carleton Putnam&rsquo;s baton.</p>
<p>The vanguardists made their own contributions. In Blood and Politics, you will read about the Posse Comitatus and Nehemiah Township, an attempt to carve out a White ethnostate in North Dakota. Bob Mathews and The Order shed blood for the ideal of a Aryan nation in the Northwest. William Pierce and the National Alliance pushed the ideal of an exclusive White ethnostate. In fact, &#8220;White Nationalism&#8221; owes more to its ruder beginnings in Aryan Nations literature and The Turner Diaries inspired bankrobbers than to Jared Taylor&rsquo;s polished suit and tie crowd. We can&rsquo;t ignore this part of our heritage.</p>
<p>If the past was reminiscient of the Dark Ages, White Nationalism has since settled into its High Medieval period. The interregnum is over. We have raised a few institutions that are like beautiful Medieval cathedrals. We have established a small network of discursive spaces that are like the first universities. We have a powerful new genomics based theory of race and and a new general theory of anti-Semitism that draws upon sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p>I foresee a period of growth and maturity ahead. The sheets and costume crowd are fading out. The old leaders are aging and dying off. Their version of racial discourse will pass away with them. In the next decade, I think a mass membership White advocacy organization will finally emerge for sane and normal people. The cultural ground has been prepared for it.</p>
<p>The field is wide open to a new generation of racialists willing to make their mark. Three decades from now, the sequel to Blood and Politics ought to prove interesting than the original. I think Mr. Zeskind will be following many of us in the years to come.</p>

		<p>Antisemitism based on sociobiology and evolutionary psychology&hellip;two pseudo-sciences.  Let&rsquo;s stick to biology proper and genetics as a threshold matter for establishing viable racialist arguements, and leave the Jewish outhcome to the culture battle which will determine which Jews will be with us, and which against.  There are plenty of good ones and we should count them with us when possible.</p>

		<p>The main problem with Zeskind&rsquo;s book and Wallace&rsquo;s review thereof is that it throws in a bunch of movements, organizations, individuals and mentalities as if they were all samey-same.  Some of them are non-racial, and explicitly anti-racist.  Some of the mentalities Wallace lists depend on multiracialist presumptions.  And I don&rsquo;t count Carto as a serious reformer, and I don&rsquo;t count William Pierce as a serious revolutionary.  Both wanted their rings kissed, nothing more.</p>

<p>You seem to have your figures wrong. Jewish influence in the media, to look at just one part of elite society, is much larger than you seem to suggest. I refer readers to The Atlantic Top 50 pundit list. According to Steve Sailer Jews make up about half of that list, which is remarkable, to say the least, considering their small numbers. In contrast, there is only one Black pundit although there are about 40 million (not 70) of them in this country. </p>
<p>Of course, the pundit list is just about pundits, and leaves Hollywood out of it. Any impartial observer would have to agree that Jews are mightily overrepresented there as well. </p>

		<p>Another problem with the &#8220;blame the Jews&#8221; ideology is that it ignores the crucial role that the white race has carried out in its own deliberate suicide. Most  American whites have consciously chosen to forsake identity and racial/ethnic preservation, and view the world through an individualistic lens of &#8220;how does this affect me and my immediate family?&#8221;. We no longer think of a nation as an extended family, but as a State with arbitrary borders, and citizenship defined as loyalty to this State. Hence the civic nationalist ideology that dominates the American Right. On top of that, American whites have chosen to place economic well-being as a priority over having children and raising a stable family. Thus we have damned ourselves as a people by taking consumerism and careerism too far. </p>
<p>We have our work cut out for us, and scapegoating an entire group of people does not help us in our quest to save white America. By scapegoating, we fail to see the big picture of how the white race poisoned itself, and therefore we will never learn what brought us into the wretched state we are in now in the first place. </p>

		<p>Hunter&rsquo;s review of Blood and Politics illuminates the vast generational chasm between White Advocacy before the Internet and White Advocacy now. For twenty-somethings like me and him, a lot of this stuff is truly boggling.</p>
<p>John McNeill,</p>
<p>One can acknowledge Jewish ethnic activism as an important factor in our dispossession while still acknowledging our own culpability for our situation and responsibility for recapturing our self-determination. I won&rsquo;t argue the case one way or the other here, because this site isn&rsquo;t the place to do so.</p>

		<p>Re. Comment #8. I would dispute the contention that White Americans have &#8220;chosen&#8221; their self-destructive mindset consciously. While I would agree that Whites have a weak sense of racial identity that borders on being race stupid at times, in truth, they have been brow beaten and programmed by organized liberal interest groups into their current racial dilemma. The anti-White and race denial propaganda has effectively suffocated White identity. That&rsquo;s why examining all influences that have brought about White degradation and self-destructive behavior is important. This isn&rsquo;t mindless &#8216;scapegoating&rsquo;, or an irrational attempt to &#8220;blame the Jews&#8221;. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because the White race now has a large problem with character. We have been bludgeoned into submissiveness by seventy years of propaganda, low level ethnic cleansing by black gangs, and our own complacency into a state of learned helplessness.</p>
<p>How do we break this paralysis? By pushing back from the keyboard and actually meeting like minded individuals. Get together with a fellow White, and simply discuss what&rsquo;s going on. You don&rsquo;t have to do the &#8220;I hate N  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  S, I HATE N  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  S!&#8221; nonsense that so many outside our race accuse us of. Just talk to one person about what you have noticed in your own neighborhood. Talk about how the current political climate is making your life more difficult. And tell two other friends that are unknown to each other. DO NOT discuss anything illegal.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m fairly new to the White Nationalist movement and just wanted to ask a question that&rsquo;s burning in my brain.  Are most of the people on this site liberals?  I ask this because I&rsquo;ve been on Stormfront a few times and they don&rsquo;t allow blacks, jews, mexicans, gays or any &#8220;progressive&#8221; types post in their main forums.  If the answer is yes I&rsquo;m wondering why the change of heart since liberals have been throwing White America under the bus for decades? Approving anything that promotes people of color or forming alliances to push their own agendas.  Are the growing numbers of minorites becoming a threat to the liberal power base?</p>

<p>Most Whites have been brow-beaten by a Hostile Elite and when they can they try and flee the situation to the best of their ability. </p>
<p>Even after massive media campaigns against us, many of us still organize along lines of &#8216;Implicit Whiteness&rsquo; as described by Professor Kevin B. Macdonald instead of committing Race Suicide.  </p>

		<p>The thing that turns me off from most &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; groups is the virulent anti-Jewish attitudes I find there, sometimes degenerating into outright Hitler adulation.  (Ask a Russian, a Pole, or a Frenchman whether he thinks Hitler was a good leader for white people.  He&rsquo;ll look at you like you fell out of tree.)  There are certainly many left leaning Jews who work against our interests.  But there are many left leaning Christians who do the same.  Alleged Catholic Ted Kennedy did as much damage to the interests of white Americans as any Jew could possibly do.  And the Catholic church is a big advocate of illegal immigration.  I don&rsquo;t think that means we should hate Catholics.  On the other hand I don&rsquo;t think any pro-white activist could find much to disagree with in professor Michael Levin&rsquo;s writings.</p>
<p>There are many white Americans who don&rsquo;t want to be a minority in this country, don&rsquo;t like being discriminated against in the name of affirmative action, are aware of the realities of black crime rates and academic performance, and are tired of the media white bashing.   But when they visit sites like Stormfront they see all the swastikas and Jew bashing and just run away.  Pro-white movements will never gain any traction if they remain mired in Jew hating.</p>

<p>Hi anon,<br/>
Glad to see you have had a racial awakening, the fact is there is a big difference between The White Nationalists on this site and the White Supremacist Neo-Nazis on Stormfront. We focus on loving and protecting our Euro-American Heritage, while Stormfromt focuses on hating and tormenting blacks,hispanics,Jews,etc etc.<br/>
 The people on this website realize that shaving your head and wearing Nazi garb is unproductive as is Jew baiting. AmRen realizes that mainstreaming as well as civility are the keys to being taken seriously.    </p>

		<p>I think Neo-Nazis, and Jew-hate and Aryan Nation type stuff is used purposely to discredit the notion that whites should look out for their genetic interests. </p>
<p>The rise of Nazism was probably the worst thing that&rsquo;s happened for whites. Millions of whites died and our ethnic identity stripped from us. </p>
<p>People who are into the Nazi hate thing and think they&rsquo;re some kind of white activist need to be educated that that kind of activity will never sell the average white person on looking out for their place in society.</p>

		<p>Crash Course in Selling it</p>
<p>You have to know how to sell the average Euro-American on looking out for their ethnic interests just like every other ethnic group in America does.</p>
<p>Nazism, hate and uniforms is ridiculous.</p>
<p>To first sell someone you have to be like they are. You hve to develop rapport. You have to identify what their values are and identify their pains caused by no one looking out for their ethnic interests. </p>
<p>Then you pose the solution. Which would be dealing with AA, bad media portrayals, loss of right to associate, immigration and lack of political or legal representation, overpopulation, urban sprawl, and environmental problems. </p>
<p>Every movement grew because someone knew how to <br/>
A) Market it<br/>
B) Sell it</p>
<p>Just reading some good sales and marketing books and learning how to properly handle objections will do the trick.</p>

		<p>This is for Ludwig in comment #2.  I am, as my screen name indicates, Jewish.  I do not practice the faith, but were the nation ever to reach a point where a round-up was commenced, I am on record as such.  So, I do have a dog in this fight.</p>
<p>I have no respect at all for the Franks, the Schumers, the Boxers, the Madoffs or the Soros&rsquo; of this world.  In fact they are beneath contempt.  Yes, they are Jewish.  But they in no way represent me, or the Jews I have as friends and acquaintances. </p>
<p>I believe I have every bit as much at stake in any coming battles to preserve what we have left, and in starting the process to bring things back into line both Constitutionally and socially.</p>
<p>I urge AmRen readers to realize that not all Jews are your enemies.  Our kids get fed the same rubbish in the schools, are surrounded with the same cultural rot, the same vulgarizing and coarsening of our society.  If you think we want this, please reconsider those thoughts.  Thank you.</p>
