<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fifty Asian students who fear for their safety today boycotted South Philadelphia High, where after dismissal others said racial tensions have long been a fact of life there.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s been going on for years,&#8221; senior Danni Glenn said. &#8220;Now it&rsquo;s getting bigger and bigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Asian students  &mdash;  who will stay out of school for a week to study, investigate a series of attacks that happened last week, and meet with community leaders  &mdash;  hope for resolution, but Glenn isn&rsquo;t optimistic.</p>
<p>She said whatever the school or other authorities have planned to stop the violence, &#8220;it&rsquo;s not going to stop anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, seven students were treated for minor injuries at Methodist Hospital, after at least five separate attacks.</p>
<p>According to students, fights between African American and Asian students started last week on the streets and spilled over Thursday into the 900-student building on South Broad Street.</p>
<p>Ten students were suspended, and criminal charges are being investigated.</p>
<p>The breakdown of school enrollment is 70 percent African American, 18 percent Asian, about 6 percent white, and 5 percent Latino.</p>
<p>The school district, which met with community groups on Friday, has increased the number of school and city police at the school and around it, according to district spokesman Fernando Gallard.</p>
<p>He said that until the recent assaults, violence was actually down there from last year.</p>

		<p>Here is a simple solution: Get Prez. Obama to address the Black and Asian students. He can explain to them that Africans and Asians must ally themselves against there common enemy, White men. This is what he did when he was visiting his half sister in Kenya. She complained to him about the problems that the Native Kenyans were having with Korean immigrants. He told her that the Koreans were her allies against White men, who were the real cause of all problems (as his mother had explained to him).</p>

		<p>The most obnoxious part of anti-Oriental bigotry on the part of blacks is that, according to a recent printed issue of AR, is that they can&rsquo;t tell this difference between Chinese, Korean and Japanese, and often use Chinese (and various anti-Chinese pejoratives) as a metaphor for all Orientals, even if they&rsquo;re not Chinese.</p>
<p>Any decent world history textbook will tell you about the centuries old three-way rivalry between the Chinese, Koreans and Japanese, so you&rsquo;d think that black American high school students might have heard of it once.  Failing that, the opening ceremonies of the Summer Olympics last year demonstrated that   &mdash;   the Chinese audience booed the Korean and Japanese teams the loudest, far more than they booed the Americans.  In the last few decades, Korean-Americans helped American efforts to perfect High Definition TV standards, mainly because they didn&rsquo;t want the Japanese to be the leaders in HDTV.</p>

<p>Can you just imagine what that 6% White goes through! The Asians and every other race should boycott these black schools and form their own private schools. Totally isolate them. Leave the blacks to their own fate. The rest of us will then have a nicer atmosphere in which to study/learn which will enable us to surpass them even further.</p>
<p> The school district, which met with community groups on Friday, has increased the number of school and city police at the school and around it, according to district spokesman Fernando Gallard.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of police is NOT going to get to the ROOT of the problem. Build more prisons [ maybe at the north pole ] and do a major sweep of these &#8220;communities&#8221;. </p>

		<p>All I can say to the parents of these Asian and white kids is do whatever you have to do to get to the suburbs and out of that hell-hole.  The safety and the very lives of your kids are at risk, to say nothing of the learning environment they&rsquo;re struggling with.</p>
<p>All Philadelphia inner city residents can do today is to separate themselves from the primitive &#8220;culture&#8221; of the inner city.</p>

		<p>On a positive note, I don&rsquo;t think that the Asians missing a week of school will cause them to lag behind a majority of their peers.  </p>

		<p>This has been going on for at least thirty years. The 6% of white kids in that school have been wiggerized and trampled into the general apathy . This is only important because the Asian community will not stand still for it. Take a stroll through Chinatown in Philly and look in vain all day for the strutting mobs of Africans. The &#8221; Asian community&#8221; will let that go on for about a minute then it will stop. Look for more on this story.</p>

		<p>The Asians will be accused of hate and racism until they finally cave in. There&rsquo;s a &#8216;hierarchy of oppressions&rsquo; and Asians aren&rsquo;t quite at the &#8216;bottom&rsquo;, as the ultimate victims of &#8216;social and institutional oppression&rsquo;. More must be done. </p>

		<p>&#8220;fights between African American and Asian students started last week&#8221;</p>
<p>When they say &#8220;fight&#8221; what they probably mean is some black student came up from behind and suckered punched the Chinese kid. That is what the news media calls a &#8220;fight&#8221;. Same as with Jena. White kid sucker punched, knocked to the ground, nearly kicked to death. That too was a &#8220;fight&#8221;! Such an amazing use of words.</p>

		<p>Enough is ENOUGH!!!</p>
<p>Wake up America!!! The majority of these students do not go to school to get an education. Teachers are underpaid babysitters. The majority of these black students do not go to school for an education, they go to have fun and bully the other students and teachers. My two daughters are very aware of the outside world.</p>

<p>I live on the boarder of Chinatown in NYC and regularly visit friends in Philly and visit that Chinatown a lot too, and in my experience, the blacks act as obnoxiously and aggressively in Chinatown as in anywhere, although I don&rsquo;t think Blacks like Chinatown very much because the scene there offers little to amuse them. </p>
<p>The Chinese operate buses which travel from one chinatown to the next are packed full of unruly blacks who patronize them because they are much cheaper the normal bus lines. Often they have small riots, stampedes and brawls when the Chinese businessmen are dishonest and sell too many tickets, or the blacks are just agitated for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Still there is a lot of organized crime in most chinatowns and illegal gambling dens and prostitution rings are rampant. If blacks made trouble in Chinatown, I am sure the triads might take notice, but generally Chinese organized crime only prays on their own kind and uses violence sparingly.</p>

<p>Absoluitely correct. The word &#8220;fight&#8221; has become a media code-word for black assault.</p>
