<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-health/20091203/US.MED.Surgeon.General/">Surgeon General: More Minority Doctors Needed</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Stobbe, Comcast News, December 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The new U.S. Surgeon General on Thursday called for stepped-up efforts in increasing the number of minority physicians.</p>
<p>In what was one of her first speeches to a large crowd since she was sworn in Nov. 3, Dr. Regina Benjamin noted that the proportion of U.S. physicians who are minorities is only 6 percent  &mdash;  the same proportion as a century ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s something wrong with that,&#8221; said Benjamin, speaking at a conference on health disparities at a hotel in downtown Atlanta.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a 27-minute speech, Benjamin told health leaders in the audience to encourage young minorities to pursue careers in medicine or other ambitions.</p>

		<p>The catch here is that she only defines &#8220;minority&#8221; as domestic blacks or any Hispanics.  She does not include Orientals and Indians, who, thanks to H-1B visas and other visas, and large medical conglomerates wanting less expensive labor, are fast becoming a higher and higher percentage of America&rsquo;s doctors going forward.</p>

		<p>You haven&rsquo;t lived until you&rsquo;ve dealt with black doctors in a professional relationship. Many come from Caribbean medical schools setting up shop here in the US doing disability evaluations for Social Security, or working in county health department clinics.  Poor language skills, non-existent bedside manners, and even questionable personal hygiene.  Believe me, I know.  But it&rsquo;s the wave of the future with socialized Obama-care medicine. </p>

Only 6 percent? Seriously? Not here in Buffalo. I had a heck of time trying to find a white doctor. Unfortunately, he moved out and because of my work insurance plan, I had to settle for an Indian.</p>
<p>Before we became obsessed with political correctness in our medical schools, I don&rsquo;t remember there ever being a shortage of white male doctors.</p>
<p>Maybe we wouldn&rsquo;t have a shortage of white male doctors if we didn&rsquo;t discourage this demographic from becoming doctors.<br>

		<p>The proportion of  doctors who are from the &#8220;protected class&#8221; is about 70%. When you include women, minorities including &#8220;hispanic&#8221; and Chinese/Indian immigrants you are having an already overwhelming proportion of doctors who owe their position to the imposition of &#8220;Diversity&#8221; in all admissions to professional schools. For those white christian males who aspire to be a doctor I would hope your application is blessed by your state senator or Dean of the Medical School, otherwise look elsewhere.</p>

<p>That black group average I.Q. in this country is 85, which means not very many blacks could grasp the course work required of doctors seems to be unknown to this woman.</p>
<p>Really sad knowing that besides revolutionaries, oddballs and misfits in the Obama administration, he picked a surgeon general who is a bit dimwitted herself.</p>
<p>Incidentally, wasn&rsquo;t this administration supposed to be color blind?  Too, weren&rsquo;t racial divisiveness supposed to a be a thing of the past?</p>
<p>Did it occur to anyone here that every promise made by Obama has been broken and every thing he was going to do has turned out to be a lie so far, except for enacting health care?  </p>

		<p>I suspect it&rsquo;s probably true that we need more doctors, and will need more still as people like me slip into their dotage.</p>
<p>But why would we need more minority (read black) doctors? We need more properly trained doctors of whatever racial and ethnic persuasion, doctors who are fully qualified.  If fewer blacks than members of other races can make the cut, too bad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t notice anybody claiming we need any more black nuclear physicists, bio-chemists, or aeronautical engineers.</p>

		<p>Does the reference to &#8220;Michael&rsquo;s Jackson personal live-in physician&#8221; mean anything to anyone?  That&rsquo;s the quality of doc you get off Affirmative Action and all the other horse manure programs that try to force unqualified blacks into scientific careers.  They can&rsquo;t handle it and end up killing people.  Oh, yes, and let us not forget the Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital in Los Angeles - closed because of substandard care, with the staff comprised of a majority of blacks&hellip;.</p>

		<p>As others have noted, the Surgeon General does not count Asians as minorities, as it is obvious that we have plenty of Asian doctors.  Instead she only sees the low IQ groups as minorities, and is apparently of the belief that what this country needs are more stupid people diagnosing and treating disease.  (I&rsquo;m not saying that the 6% of current doctors who are black or Hispanic are stupid, I am saying that to bring the percentage of black or Mestizo doctors up to the same percentage as white or Asian doctors you will indeed have to recruit some stupid people.)<br>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s true, and it&rsquo;s rarely mentioned.  White males are discriminated against in entry to medical schools and scholarships, in favor of less-qualified females and blacks.  For many reasons, females tend to drop out, or downgrade their specialties, or switch to part-time, and blacks tend to drop out because of academic or social reasons.  Leaving (surprise!) a &#8220;shortage of doctors&#8221;, which can only be filled by importing foreign doctors - and it&rsquo;s hardly a coincidence that these foreign doctors happen to be non-white.  This physician shortage is artificial and is the direct result of disrimination against talented and qualified white males.</p>

		<p>I was accepted to medical school and did not go.  This was a huge disappointment to my grandparents.  I am doing fine as a nurse.  More and more men are coming into nursing.  I don&rsquo;t just mean gay ones.  Nurses can make more money than doctors.  It depends on which specialty is chosen. I have been working in critical care and am paid better than doctors in &#8220;primary care.&#8221;  I am serious.  Some of you white guys here might consider nursing.  Really.  I just got my license in anesthesiology earlier this year and am now making as much as M.D.&rsquo;s who were doctors before I was born.  </p>
<p>There is always an M.D. officially in charge, but you may never even see him.  I say him because usually it is a man.  In critical care you will be making decisions about the patients because seconds count.  A decision has to be made, and it has to be made now.  It is not like you are always somebody&rsquo;s handmaiden.  Just don&rsquo;t do anything so stupid that the doctor will be shaking his head and thinking that you are an idiot. </p>
<p>You guys who feel like you are facing discrimination in medical school admissions really ought to look into nursing.  That is just my opinion naturally, but my decision is not one that I have ever regretted. Nursing is looking for a few good men and maybe more than a few.  Just think about it for your son or your nephew if you are not interested yourself.       </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pathetic that by insisting that all children are equal in their potential, egalitarians don&rsquo;t realize they are setting them up for failure from the beginning. Regardless of how driven he is, a black with an IQ of 85 does not a brain surgeon make. </p>

		<p>I am going to go find some information about this Dr Regina Benjamin on the web, because I would like to know if she&rsquo;s part of one of the majorities she speaks about.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it would be a good thing to have more minority physicians, in the US: if they work for less money, they are going to bring down the wages of white doctors, who between you and me, deserve to be well paid for the difficult and essential work they do. PLus, they don&rsquo;t necessarily have the knowledge and abilities of white doctors.</p>

		<p>pardon the lack of cap&rsquo;s or certain punctuation d/t broken keyboard.</p>
<p>as a former pre-med student myself in the early &#8216;70&rsquo;s i can attest to the fact that affirmative action was alive and well back then. i didn&rsquo;t even know what a.a. was until i was a junior pre-med student. at my college we had a &#8216;pre-med society&rsquo; which was formed as sort of a fraternity of pre-med, pre-dent and nursing students that met monthly on monday nights. each year we would take a field trip to nearby medical or dental schools. my third year i went on a field trip to baylor medical school in houston - the famed heart surgeon dr. michael debakey&rsquo;s headquarters. i noticed a black female came along that had not been attending our meetings&hellip;.and i never missed any meetings. i sat for lunch at a table where faculty who came along were seated and we talked. i asked them about who she was..this black girl i had never met before. they informed me of her name and that she was a senior who had been accepted to 3 medical schools. she had come on the trip to &#8221;shop around&#8221; b/c baylor was one of the schools to which she had been accepted. i had no idea what affirmative action was or how it worked. the faculty - various biology professors one of which was my pre-med advisor and head of the biololgy dept. - informed me of how a.a. worked and that it favored black females much, much more than white males and that race was one of the primary factors that influenced admission to med school, which was very competitive&hellip;unless you were black and especially a female. i was flabbergasted. i had been that naive all those years on a subject that directly involved my career in that simply b/c an applicant was black and female she would be favored so heavily above white males. the average g.p.a. of a white male applicant who was accepted was in the 3.6 and above range. i found out through inquiring around that most all the upper classmen were familiar with her and she was notorious for making bad grades but staying with the program. her overall g.p.a. was reported to be 2.2. i was outraged. how could this be so. she had been accepted to 3 med schools. a white guy was very lucky to have been accepted to one&hellip;and with a 3.6 g.p.a. and high mcat - admission test - score.<br>
ever since that time my wide-eyed, quasi-liberal idealism has drastically changed to a sane, more rational, mature conservative ideology.<br>
and now our black female surgeon general calls for more affirmative action. i can say this from someone who has walked the walk, a.a. breeds racial resentment when there was none before. young white men with years of study and hard work being edged out by much less qualified blacks does not sit well.</p>
<p>btw, did anyone catch the carefully covered-up story about a black e.r. doctor, cleveland enmon, who was fired from a california hospital for stealing a rolex watch of a dying man that was having a heart attack. boy is this ever a case of a story that was concealed from national news, which it should have made. the &#8216;doc&rsquo;, a 32 y.o. traveling doctor, during a &#8221;code blue&#8221; in which all staff and equipment are used in a live-saving effort, allegedly slipped the rolex off the dying man&rsquo;s arm during the code. after he had been pronounced dead, the nurses noted that the white man&rsquo;s flashy rolex had disappeared. they also noticed a watch-sized bulge in the doc&rsquo;s scrub pants pocket. security was called and they instructed no one to leave the e.r. enmon made a break for it and ran to the hospital parking lot. one of the white nurses followed him and saw him toss the watch under a bush. additionally, the act was captured on a security surveillance camera. the nurse retrieved the watch and the doc was fired on the spot.<br>
this happened last summer and has received scant attention. if the races were reversed, we&rsquo;d be treated to an almost daily update on the trial similar to the amanda knox debackle in italy.<br>
for anyone interested, do a youtube search for this. i don&rsquo;t have a link. if you&rsquo;ll type in &#8221;dr. cleveland enmon rolex watch&#8221; it should get you there. this heinous crime committed by a medical professional is absolutely cold and outrageous&hellip;and should have been covered nationally. <br>
goes to show you how careful the media is to conceal black-on-white crime and explains why all the news networks except fox are loosing viewership by the droves. newspapers are going broke and i look for many of the other t.v. news programs to fold. <br>
this also demonstrates how the news manipulates public opinion when it concerns race. <br>
even if race weren&rsquo;t mentioned, the first name &#8221;cleveland&#8221; should clue you in to the race of the doctor.  </p>

		<p>I am a physician and had read this news story prior to the posting on AmRen. I found it unnerving to say the least. The current Surgeon General is an example of low mediocrity in action. Her past has been burnished by the media into something she is not. In any event, past SGs have been black and just as dim - I&rsquo;m certain they are chosen for their color (and lack of true responsibility as the SG is a figurehead position) so the government does not appear racist.</p>
<p>For a number of years I was on faculty at a US med school and also worked with the admissions committee so I feel I have some insight. I am currently in private practice.</p>
<p>The reason there are so few black doctors is evident to anyone with even minimal skills of observation. On the whole, blacks cannot handle the academic demands of medical education. While many medical schools would love to announce &#8220;diversity&#8221; by increasing black enrollment - unlike other professional schools - they are far more careful about admitting applicants who cannot succeed. </p>
<p>Admission to US medical schools remains very competitive even for strongly qualified white applicants. Medical schools do not like to play games or pander to students who &#8220;need help&#8221; for  several reasons. First, if the student drops out for academic reasons not only does the attrition look bad for the school it becomes a problem to fill the lost student&rsquo;s spot as the class moves on to the second, third, and fourth years of study. This creates lost tuition revenue as well.</p>
<p>If the school does manage to push through a weak student then new problems emerge. The newly graduated doctor enters a residency program - does poorly - and the school gets tagged with a bad reputation and hurts future candidates for the residency slots. Many people fail to realize that it is often more important in a doctor&rsquo;s career where he or she completes a residency than where he or she actually graduated from medical school. </p>
<p>Also, a marginally qualified black candidate will also have issues being surrounded by high achieving white students. To be frank, medical educators - fairly or unfairly - are not known for empathy and no student or resident gets a free pass - they are all overworked and criticized just the same.</p>
<p>If one reads the article above you would think that medical schools are somehow discriminating against black candidates. Not so. Unlike schools of education, for example, where most blacks get doctorates, or even law schools, where academically weak students can pass on the basis of subjectivity in exam grading, simply attending medical school is only part of the equation. Medical students still have to pass parts I, II, and III of national licensing exams (boards) among other exams (such as board certification exams). Medical schools are highly embarrassed if their students fail board exams. </p>
<p>Overall, US medical schools do not tolerate academically undisciplined students. As much as members of the admissions committee wanted to consider accepting even a weak black candidate when I was on faculty (late 1990s) they simply felt it too much of a gamble after being repeatedly burned in the 1980s.</p>
<p>At least for now, American medical education tends not to place too much emphasis on political correctness when it comes to training physicians. Still, black candidates were often often invited for interviews or accepted despite having markedly lower GPAs and MCAT scores than rejected white candidates. I found this to be extremely upsetting and unfair.  </p>
<p>The low number of blacks in US medical schools is also due to entrance requirements. For example, law schools often require only a college degree. The student can choose to major in &#8220;African Studies&#8221; or basket weaving or whatever. US medical schools - while generally open to students in any undergraduate major - also require applicants to take two years of college chemistry, including organic chemistry, one year of biology, one year of physics, and one year of math - at a minimum. Blacks frequently are unable to complete the rquirements - hence they cannot apply. </p>
<p>In science courses - and in medical school - grading is basically objective. In biochemistry or gross anatomy or pharmacology there is one right answer. No one can claim racism.</p>
<p>I graduated from medical school in the late 1980s. The graduating class numbered 141. There were six black students who started - four years later two graduated. The other four were dismissed for academic reasons. Three non-blacks who started did not graduate - non for academic reasons.</p>
<p>My point is - to increase black enrollment the academic and educational standards will have to be lowered. There is no other way. This turns another field of excellence into a bastion of failure - it is a total disgrace. Still, the study of medicine is a lot of work - if nothing else medical students cannot be lazy. I&rsquo;d like to see how that will be changed.</p>
<p>Lastly, our friend the surgeon general attended Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. This &#8220;historically black&#8221; school accepts mostly black students. While the school clearly discriminates against non-blacks based on academics everyone basically looks the other way because black doctors have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Based on the AMA&rsquo;s statistics (the AMA loves statistics) via AMCAS (the application service) for 2008, the average MCAT score of an admitted Morehouse student was 27 (vs the national average of 32). Science GPAs fell lower than 2.7. The other two &#8220;historically black&#8221; med schools were worse - Meharry in Tennessee had an average entering MCAT score of 25 and Howard, in DC, was also 25. If not for these &#8220;black schools&#8221; there would be virtually no black physicians in the US since over 50% of practicing black doctors in the US graduated from one of these institutions. </p>
<p>By making these comments the surgeon general, in my eyes, comes off as a fool. She is paying more attention to race than to the public health. Her job is not to decide what background or skin color medical schools must accept. Her job is not to indirectly blame others for the lack of black medical students. She seems to want to socialize the admissions process at the expense of quality. </p>
<p>One can worry about Obama&rsquo;s push for changes in health care - which, in reality, is simply a way to give free health insurance to unemployed minorities - but one should really worry about who will be providing that health care in the decades to come.</p>

		<p>So Dr. Benjamin deliberately omits Indian, Pakistani, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Filipino etc etc medics from her pat little statistic.<br>
 - Why is such a blatant liar allowed to have a high position?<br>
 - Would you trust such a dishonest person as your physician?</p>
<p>Another point and a traditionally very vexed subject  - what are the relative proportions of White gentile versus Jewish doctors, and how does that ratio compare to the general population?<br>

		<p>So let&rsquo;s kill patients in order to raise an arbitrary number of 6%. BTW, the balance of physicians aren&rsquo;t all white. Thousands of Asian doctors capably fill US medical staffing needs created by the lazy, low IQ black population which will never put the long hrs, or simply cannot for intellectual capacity reasons, in to become certified doctors and specialists.</p>

		<p>someone should do a survey of wealthy, elite whites who support race quotas in medicine to see whether EVEN ONE of them has EVER had a black doctor. </p>
<p>Asian-Americans have advanced quickly in medicine: they are high scorers, quotas would be superfluous. </p>
<p>While left wing whites avoid black doctors like the plague, where I come from, right wing whites, including racists, are reassured when their spouse has cancer and the doctor is a chinese American woman.</p>
<p>If a black moved into their neighborhood, they would have a heart attack - and then rush off to a Japanese-American doctor to save them.</p>
<p>Asians tend to be smart, thorough, hyper-responsible, and non-egotistical, and they make terrific doctors.</p>
<p>What keeps blacks out of medicine (and engineering, and many other fields) is limited intellect, and everyone know it.</p>
<p>If you say it, you are a monster and a criminal.</p>

		<p>What he means of course is that the LEGAL IMMIGRANT hindus should be allowed to continue the colinization of  the AMERICAN medical profession up to the point where they are the majority racail group in the preofession. And with  complete racial dominance over the medical profession will come enormous power that will be used to shut  NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS completely out of the medical profession.</p>
<p>How did NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS ever manage to survive all the many decades wihout hindu medical doctors? Quite well thankyou. The best policy for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS:0 hindu LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.</p>

		<p>If the percentage has remained the same as a century ago, then racial discrimination can no longer be blamed.  Is the SG suggesting racial quotas?  Then we will either have unqualified black students dropping out or flunking med school or MD&rsquo;s who are incompetent.  I believe one of the greatest fears regarding socialized medicine in the U.S. is that people will be assigned to less-than-stellar black physicians.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;American&#8221; doctors today are mostly all minorities. I have yet to find a White doctor that isn&rsquo;t about ready to retire. Most are older now and the medical schools promote minorities and discourage Whites from pursuing a medical degree. I have such a hard time even communicating and understanding these minority doctors today. I have also heard some horror stories about these black/mexican etc. doctors. I most certainly do not trust their &#8220;observations and diagnosis&#8221;. I rely on natural medicine and herbs and vitamins in my older age as I cannot in good faith go to these doctors any longer.</p>

		<p>Can anyone   &mdash;   including our affirmative-action attorney-general   &mdash;   explain <i>why</i> we supposedly &#8220;need&#8221; more &#8220;minority physicians?&#8221;</p>
<p>Will it increase the quality of medical care?  Will progress in medical research be somehow improved?  Will the general health of the country rise?</p>
<p>Strange, but I thought that &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t matter,&#8221;  that &#8220;we are all equal,&#8221; and that &#8220;race is only a social construct.&#8221;  If any of these things are true, it shouldn&rsquo;t make any difference what race a doctor is.</p>
<p>This is all about special deals for blacks and browns, period.  The only real question is  how many White people will see through the hypocrisy.<br>

		<p>Yes, let&rsquo;s push for more minority doctors.  The attorney my sister worked for, has a son who when he was in medical school, said that medical schools now have to offer remedial classes for minorities.  </p>

&#8220;(I&rsquo;m not saying that the 6% of current doctors who are black or Hispanic are stupid&hellip;&hellip;..)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not stupid&#8221; compared to what?   The average black and Hispanic?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting most of them aren&rsquo;t qualified to be doctors per the standards set by this country for years now.  I&rsquo;ve listened to some horror stories around my area from people who wanted to &#8220;give a black doctor a chance&#8221; only to be bitterly disappointed later.</p>
<p>There ARE some decent Cuban Hispanic doctors, though, who have good reputations in Florida.</p>
<p>And so far as recruiting stupid people, isn&rsquo;t that what they&rsquo;re doing now with affirmative action?</p>

		<p>Minority doctors for minorities and white doctors for us whites!</p>
<p>Most of the black doctors I have heard about are doctor by name only, not by professional skills and knowledge.</p>
