<h1>Culture Clash Tears Somali Family Apart</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Tokasz, Buffalo News, December 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Somalian immigrant Malaika Sabtow raised five children in African refugee camps, surviving for 14 years without electricity, amid persistent drought and regular outbreaks of malaria and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>But none of those 14 years, she said, was as bad as the past five months in Buffalo.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how long it has been since the Erie County Department of Social Services took all of her children  &mdash;  she now has six, including a nursing 2-month-old daughter  &mdash;  and placed them in a foster home for reasons Sabtow doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Sabtow, 28, wishes she were back in Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I had the kids there,&#8221; she said through a translator, Imam Yahye Omar. &#8220;Here everything is good, but if they are taking the kids from you, Africa is better.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Social Services Commissioner Carol Dankert said she could not comment on why the children were removed or whether they would be returned.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Khamis [Malaika Sabtow&rsquo;s husband, Madhey A. Khamis] received a letter in September from a county caseworker explaining that a report of suspected child abuse or maltreatment had been &#8220;indicated&#8221;  &mdash;  meaning credible evidence had been found to support &#8220;the determination that you maltreated or abused the child(ren) named in the report.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Corporal punishment is acceptable in Somalia, according to friends, who said Khamis didn&rsquo;t intend to hurt his son.</p>
<p>&#8220;They already understand that what the man did is a no-no here,&#8221; said Osman Dualeh Abdullah, a longtime Buffalo resident who is from Somalia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Child Protective Services, they don&rsquo;t know the culture. They need to be educated,&#8221; said Omar [imam of the Islamic Cultural Association of Western New York]. &#8220;There is a lot of abuse going on in America, but not with these people. Kids are the most valuable thing they have in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the very least, the kids should be placed in homes more sensitive to their cultural needs, friends of the family said.</p>
<p>The parents have told friends and others that the children appeared ill in their few supervised visits with them.</p>
<p>The baby girl, Shamia, who is now 6 months old, has rashes on her body and constantly cries during the visits, according to Sabtow. Shamia was being breast-fed at the time she was taken from Sabtow.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The children have been split among three foster homes  &mdash;  none of which is a Muslim family, said Omar, the imam.</p>
<p>One of the boys, Mustaffa, 12, was pulled out of an Islamic boarding school and placed in School 19, even though his parents paid $3,600 in advance for the boy to attend the private school.</p>
<p>According to Omar, Mustaffa told his mother that the people he was living with would not allow him to practice Islam.</p>
<p>A daughter, Fatuma, 11, also has not been allowed to wear the traditional Muslim head scarf, Omar said.</p>
<p>And none of the children was able to participate in Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, he said.</p>

		<p>Some of the best advice I ever read concerned Child Protective Services. It said that if you are ever visited or receive a notice of investigation, leave your home and state of residence immediately. No! Don`t even go in the back bedroom looking for a favorite toy or sweater. Sixty seconds  or less could be the difference between getting out of the driveway and being blocked in by Sherrif`s deputies. Tell a trusted friend or neighbor to gain access to the home and get your belongings for the short term. Have them meet you with your clothes etc. at a safe neutral location. Tell them to be sure they are not followed.  Then from your new place of residence hire a moving company to get the rest. Having the State snatch your children is worse than losing them in a nuclear attack or fire. They will be alive and in anguish and you will not be able to do anything about it but gnash your teeth. People in divorce or custody disputes should have a &#8220;bug-out&#8221; bag at the ready on an instants notice.</p>

		<p>The great thing about America is that our door swings both ways.</p>
<p>If a Somali, Korean, Brazilian, or an Irishman doesn&rsquo;t like it here, we have no problem allowing them to leave.  No Berlin-style walls exist. </p>
<p>The Sabtows also need to understand that the line for goodies ends when they get back to their land of enchantment. </p>

		<p>Raising six children and can still afford private boarding school?</p>
<p>Because Somalis have become masters at using the system, I&rsquo;m suspicious.  A privileged, private education is a luxury which should not be available to anyone taking as much as a dime in subsidies from the taxpayer-funded safety net.</p>

		<p>What a manipulative article.</p>
<p>It implies a cultural misunderstanding and over-reaction by American authorities.</p>
<p>More likely, this person raped their child and/or nearly beat them to death.  The underlying cause is a lack of value of human life.  If they are angry, they beat whomever can&rsquo;t beat them back.  If the child dies, they make another one.</p>
<p>Only sociopaths would act in such a way in our world.  But such behavior is typical in somalia.  Is that insanity?  It&rsquo;s debateable.  It implies it could ever be different there.  Or that if you remove a person from that insane situation and bring them to the relatively sane west, change is possible.</p>
<p>That probably isn&rsquo;t possible.</p>
<p>Put another way, the state intervened in this case.  Did it change anything?  Has there been a single case where such intervention changed anything?  No?  What implication does that have for if they should be allowed into our country under any circumstances?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just end up in prison&hellip;..until we run out of prison space.  Then the wherever they live will become like somalia.</p>

		<p>Each of the tens of thousands of Somali who were recently brought into the USA is a  poverty bomb.  But, worse than a bomb that explodes once, each of these low-IQ, low-achieving immigrants will continue to require massive tax-payer paid social-services their entire life, and this will repeat with each generation.  What will be the generational cost of this single family over 5 genertaions?  Millions?  Tens of millions?  STOP IMPORTING POVERTY.  The USA gains nothing from the importation of Somalis.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, just one minute!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t their &ldquo;culture&rdquo; superior to ours and the reason they are here in the first place? After all, is not the West &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; by such diversity?</p>
<p>Who are we to question this &ldquo;truth?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>I have often thought that more than anything else, sending a Somali &#8220;refugee&#8221; to a place like Buffalo or Lewiston Maine, or St. Paul Minnesota is so inappropriate. Desert dwellers from a nation right on the very edge of the equator, having a hot climate and NO SNOW - - folks find themselves totally out of place! Well, thanks to the social workers.</p>

		<p>Say what you want, but after hearing enough horror stories I&rsquo;m inclined to take the side of the Somali woman against the social services people.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be so quick to assume that the mother was horribly mistreating her children.  These departments act on unverified complaints and rumor, taking your children first and asking questions later, if at all.  It&rsquo;s a cruel reversal of the presumption of innocence, and the standard for what qualifies as &#8220;abuse&#8221; is what, in a criminal context, one might call unconstitutionally vague.  Evidently there is not even an equivalent of habeas corpus, as Commissioner Dankert need not disclose the reason the children were taken from their mother!   </p>

<p>Which mostly dictates the muslims eat or drink nothing, smoke, have sex or any number of things during the daylight hours. Children are not expected to observe it until teen years as I understand it in Kuwait and Saudi. Such comments would appear to enhance the EVIL WHITE&rsquo;S reputation for oppressing the innocent muslims.</p>

Child welfare agencies are a tough one. On the one hand, you don&rsquo;t want the government to take away your kids because of your beliefs. On the other, there are children who have violent, angry, and mentally unstable parents whose lives are in danger.</p>
<p>This article was actually part of a black call in radio program yesterday in Buffalo. A black woman called to say how outraged she was that these black kids were being taken away from not just their parents but their culture. The worst outrage the caller claimed was that black foster care children are placed with white foster parents and that&rsquo;s where the &#8216;real abuse&rsquo; starts (she didn&rsquo;t elaborate but the host agreed with her). It never seemed to occur to either of them that any social or behavioral problems might have been formed long ago with the abusive parents.</p>
<p>Whatever the issue, it&rsquo;s always the white man to blame.<br/>

		<p>I just cannot understand why the West is importing African economic disaster cases when Africa is killing and forcing out white Africans whose families have lived there for hundreds of years and provided expertise and especially food, even in drought times.  Now we can expect the African bloc to start begging again for massive aid from the West, the &#8220;man-made&#8221; global warming being the latest reason: it is all our fault according to them.</p>
<p>When will the West wake up and realise that for them to succeed if that is possible, they need to be forced to stand on their own feet, not sit begging for cash much of which is stored in personal banks outside of Africa.</p>

		<p>Her family should have never been allowed into the US.</p>
<p>Even places like Utah now have thousands of African refugees who were probably flown over and resettled at the expense of American taxpayers. Utah took in 173 Somalis, and 5,130 total refugees, in 2008. I think they&rsquo;ll live to regret that decision.<br/>
It&rsquo;s madness to bring in third worlders when there&rsquo;s so many problems with the ones that are already here.<br/>

		<p>A couple of years ago in Ottawa, Canada, a gang of teen-aged Somali females swarmed lone white females to beat and rob them.  </p>
<p>By the time it went to court, one of the defendants was already a single mother.  </p>
<p>The response of the police is more community outreach, basketball courts, and hiring its first Somali police officer.  It is often overlooked by immigration enthusiasts that North American police and social services don&rsquo;t speak the language of Third World people, forcing them to budget for special hirings.</p>

		<p>So the family didn&rsquo;t have electricty for 14 years but they come here &amp; can afford private school? What an incredible reversal of fortune! I&rsquo;m sure whatever skills they had in Somalia that couldn&rsquo;t afford electricity just happened to be valued so highly in the U.S. that they can now afford for little Mustaffa to attend a private school. Must be some of those important, highly trained, Somali nothing technicians we couldn&rsquo;t live without.</p>

		<p> Just allowing them into our country as immigrants is sufficient cause to oust the bureaucrats that allow it. And if there is any group that is likely to need the attention of CFS, it&rsquo;s the Africans and mideasterners.<br/>
  Having said that, I must say that CFS in its various state incarnations has become an instrument of oppression everywhere it exists. I have seen them snatch kids out of homes for little or no reason, and pointedly ignore verifiable serious ongoing abuse. Like many of our other &#8220;public service &#8221; agencies, they have become nothing more than oppressive mini-Gestapos, eschewing true service and compassion for an anything-goes agenda concerned solely with getting their share of the swill at the public trough.<br/>

<p>I agree with you.  DFS/CPS horror stories make the IRS seem like angels.  I think the reason why CPS agencies are as bad as they are is twofold:  (1)  They are motivated by left-wing extremist and collective ideology that eschews the rights of parents, and (2) It&rsquo;s about &#8220;the children,&#8221; therefore, nobody checks their power.  They think they&rsquo;re on a moral crusade, and that they&rsquo;re on the side of the angels.  There is nothing worse than a government bureaucrat on a moral crusade, even if it&rsquo;s a brand of morality I agree with. </p>

		<p>The crimes that the authorities suspected could be sexual mutilation.  By some estimates over 95% of Somali girls have their genitals butchered without anesthetic at the mothers&rsquo; request. They bring in &#8220;cutters&#8221; from out of town and have &#8220;cutting parties&#8221; in which they get several families to gather and serve up their daughters to these imported genital mutilators.  This is the filthy truth that the newspapers across the US deliberately fail to report. Social workers take the children away, see that they have been mutilated, yet do not report the crime to the police. </p>
<p>And if they do, the doctors lie.  The nurses lie.  The police lie.  They know these girls are genitally butchered to make them more &#8220;beautiful&#8221; for their husbands and to keep them from feeling sexual desire and &#8220;acting out&#8221; sexually, yet they do nothing.</p>
<p>The doctors, nurses, social workers, police and hospital administrators should be imprisoned for decades for not enforcing the laws of the land.  </p>
<p>And all these mutilated kids and parents should be immediately expelled from America, loaded up on a boat and sent back to Africa where they and their filthy and degrading traditions are accepted and approved of.</p>
