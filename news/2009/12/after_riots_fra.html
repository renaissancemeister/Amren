<h1><a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/GEE5AT1VR.htm">After Riots, France Fails to Improve Poor Suburbs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Estelle Shirbon, AlertNet, November 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The enclaves of poverty on the edges of French cities have fallen further behind the rest of society since a wave of riots in 2005, official data showed on Monday, casting doubt on government pledges to stop the rot.</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy, elected in 2007, had promised a &#8220;Marshall Plan&#8221; to improve life in the deprived suburbs after decades of neglect, but a government report showed that the rhetoric had not translated into concrete results.</p>
<p>The troubled neighbourhoods, labelled &#8220;sensitive urban zones&#8221; or ZUS, are clusters of tower blocks with high proportions of people from an immigrant background, where unemployment, poverty and school drop-out rates are high.</p>
<p>In its latest annual report, the official watchdog that monitors the ZUS found that the gaps in income and jobless rates between the neighbourhoods&rsquo; 4.5 million inhabitants and the broader society had continued to widen after the 2005 riots.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still stuck in a ghetto,&#8221; said Claude Dilain, mayor of Clichy-sous-Bois, the suburb of Paris where the unrest began after two local youths died while fleeing from police.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are back where we were before 2005 .&nbsp;.&nbsp.; If nothing is done, we are heading for disaster,&#8221; he told Le Monde newspaper.</p>
<p>Dilain is one of many critics who say that the government has not been serious in its efforts to provide better housing and schools for the suburbs and reduce unemployment there.</p>
<p>During a visit to three suburbs last week, Sarkozy set aside broader social themes to focus on crime, promising to improve security by installing thousands of security cameras.</p>
<p>This infuriated social workers and local officials who said it was a narrow, populist reponse to a complex set of problems.</p>
<p>JOBLESS YOUNG MEN</p>
<p>Labour Minister Xavier Darcos said he saw &#8220;encouraging signs&#8221; in Monday&rsquo;s report, citing the overall unemployment rate in the ZUS which inched down to 16.9 percent in 2008 from 17.2 percent in 2003.</p>
<p>But the small print showed that the improvement was due to a drop in jobless numbers among women, while for young men aged 15 to 24, the rate increased to 41.7 percent, compared with less than 25 percent for the same age group nationally.</p>
<p>This was particularly worrisome as young men were the group whose anger spilled out onto the streets in 2005.</p>
<p>Then, running street battles between police and hooded youths who torched cars and buildings made entire neighbourhoods look like war zones for weeks, making world headlines and shocking public opinion.</p>
<p>Despite the wake-up call, jobless rates remained stuck at daunting levels in the troubled suburbs, on average more than 9 percentage points higher than in neighbouring streets where residents were better integrated in society, the report found.</p>
<p>It also found that a third of ZUS residents lived under the poverty line set at 908 euros ($1,365) per month, compared with 12 percent in the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Before the economic downturn, the rate was rising in the ZUS while elsewhere it was stable. The report did not provide more recent data taking the recession into account. (Editing by Tim Pearce)</p>

<p>The problem is in having too many non-whites.  It has nothing at all to do with any kind of improvement to the suburbs.</p>
<p>In fact, getting rid of non-whites WOULD without doubt improve the suburbs.</p>
<p>If it were up to me, I&rsquo;d make sure they understood that.</p>

<p>Just as in America with American blacks, money and programs can&rsquo;t undo genetics.</p>
<p>You could give them free homes, free money, free food, free everything and they would still sink to their natural station in life. Some boats will never rise even in a rising tide.</p>

If almost any Frenchman would say this point blank in private, then why don&rsquo;t they VOTE for Front National in private, which is still a better solution to the problem than doing nothing or electing the mainstream liberal parties?</p>

Quite simple, dear Anonymous!   Because   the &#8220;elitists&#8221; who control the media, academia, and especially the government, DESIRE to have the Africans&rsquo; wonderful diversity, in order to make themselves feel safe against the unpredictable, dangerous, European populace.  The more diversity the better.   That is why. </p>

<p>They DID vote, for Sarkozy, that is, thinking that he would  fill their hopes and dreams, and would handle &#8220;the problem&#8221; .  He did not. </p>
<p>They were told (by all the media in unison) that LePen was a disturbed lunatic and a monster, so of course they avoided him like poison. They voted for Sarkozy instead.   Now, they have exactly the same problems as before, only under a new administration.  Plus ça change!</p>
<p>PS. Very few would dare say this,  in private or anywhere else. Criticizing immigration is xenophobia and possible racism. Highly illegal!  </p>

		<p>Yes, indeedy - the French people DO have the vote, last time I looked; so why don&rsquo;t they vote to send the immigrants back where they came from?  Didn&rsquo;t the Aussies do something like that?  Over here, of course, it&rsquo;s ILLEGAL, disgustingly; but if the French can&rsquo;t vote &#8216;em out, then &#8220;Let them eat escargot&#8221; until they rot.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>From the very first sentence, I can take issue. I both agree and disagree.  First, these are not &#8220;enclaves&#8221; of poverty. They are exclaves, to be precise. That is, they are not POCKETS of poverty surrounded by large French cities. [And when journalists speak of &#8220;poverty&#8221; in France they mean Africans and Arabs, automatically,   without calling them by name.)   To the contrary, these areas have grown so large and populous that they are now large expanses (of foreigners) which are engulfing French cities. The cities themselves are  becoming POCKETS or &#8220;enclaves&#8221; (of Frenchmen)  SURROUNDED BY  non-European imigrants. </p>
<p>These areas are also not so afflicted by &#8220;poverty&#8221; as they are by foreign customs and attitudes (and people).  Anyone receiving a minimum of $1365. per month for doing absolutely nothing is not living in dire poverty. Hardly!  These people are not going hungry.  They are not homeless. Thus, their problem is foreignness and alienation, one of culture not of poverty.  And their government-provided housing is substantial and modern.  These are airy, spacious, garden developments.  They are not crumbling slums, except for what the inhabitants inevitably turn them into.  When you keep chickens and sheep out on the balcony and slaughter them in the bathtub, what can be expected?</p>
<p>As for rioting in 1965, referring to it that way is playing down the story as if it&rsquo;s all over and past. But it&rsquo;s not. There has been spordic rioting around the country every year since then (some of it leaking out), but which goes largely un-reported by the news; and the government has desperately tried to suppress statistics,  forbidding filming of crimes and insisting that X-number of cars burned on any given occasion is only &#8220;normal&#8221;.  Hence, everything is just fine,  perfectly normal, nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>I was in Paris last Christmas-New Years, and there was rioting going on, not far from me, even then. If I hadn&rsquo;t&rsquo; been there personally, I would not have known it.   Except for a tiny blip that got through on television one morning (just once, which was not repeated!), there was nothing in the news.  I found nothing in the papers either. This is an embarrassment to Sarkozy who campaigned on eliminating this sort of thing;  and he&rsquo;s very, very conscious of manipulating his public image. He&rsquo;s known for that.   He got into office with the enthusiastic support of the press, which presented him as a strong law-and-order  man and  the respectable alternative to LePen.  He was their darling, their protégé, and they&rsquo;re not going to stab him in the back now.  So they cooperate. </p>
<p>The situation is approaching a dénouement.  France is walking on thin ice, all the while in official  denial;   but eventually one of these riots that don&rsquo;t officially exist is going to get out of control. Then all of Europe could be aflame.<br/>

<p>Perhaps they&rsquo;ve said it in private to you, and I don&rsquo;t dispute you. That may be your experience.  But they certainly haven&rsquo;t said it to me.  I have NEVER found ANYONE who&rsquo;s even willing to discuss the topic.  They either clam up, or hastily change the subject. It&rsquo;s just something they don&rsquo;t talk about. I&rsquo;ve found the same fearful attitude in Germany, and I&rsquo;ve even been cautioned that I&rsquo;d better be careful because I&rsquo;m  flirting with the law  (in trying to speak about immigration).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Europe today!  There is an aura of fear surrounding the whole subject.  It&rsquo;s taboo.</p>
<p>This is the &#8220;freedom&#8221; they fought the 2ndWW in order to preserve!<br/>
