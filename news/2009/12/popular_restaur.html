<h1>Popular Restaurant Went From Hot Water to Grant Bonanza</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Heaney, Buffalo News, December 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gigi&rsquo;s, a restaurant that doubles as a sort of communal kitchen table for much of the city&rsquo;s black community, failed to turn over its sales tax receipts to the state or pay its unemployment insurance. The state then took legal action and eventually got the money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happened 10 times, involving $56,220 in delinquent payments.</p>
<p>But Gigi&rsquo;s repeated failure to pay its bills to government didn&rsquo;t stop City Hall from giving the restaurant $143,988 in state and federal grants in 2008 to renovate the restaurant.</p>
<p>In fact, city grant makers working for the Buffalo Economic Renaissance Corp. apparently weren&rsquo;t aware of the restaurant&rsquo;s history of difficulties with the state.</p>
<p>Nor were they apparently aware that the owner&rsquo;s son used the restaurant as a staging ground in 2006-07 to sell handicapped parking permits he had stolen from the city, even though he had been arrested by city police and prosecuted in City Court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The BERC official who oversaw the grant was Michelle Barron, then a vice president. She was fired in July over her role in the funding and management of One Sunset, a failed restaurant owned by former basketball player Leonard Stokes. One Sunset&rsquo;s bad debt includes $160,000 in city and county loans and grants.</p>
<p>Gigi&rsquo;s has been a community institution since Blondine Harvin opened it in 1962. The restaurant, at 257 E. Ferry St. near Jefferson Avenue, is a frequent haunt for many African-American politicians and a destination for well-known visitors, ranging from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, to Hillary Rodham Clinton, to the Rev. Al Sharpton.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The restaurant&rsquo;s first grant application dates to 2005, in the midst of a turbulent period. The state departments of Labor, and Taxation and Finance took legal action against the restaurant in April 2006, seeking relatively modest payments of about $500 each. But in July, the tax department filed a lien for $7,944.</p>
<p>It was the latest in a long line of actions taken by the state against the restaurant since 1998 for failure to pay as much as $15,965 in sales tax receipts and lesser amounts for unpaid unemployment insurance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>BERC granted final approval of the last of the grants in 2008, with the restaurant committed to investing $35,998, and work began that fall.</p>
<p>The restaurant was closed for more than two months late last year while crews went to work. The restaurant was painted inside and out. The roof and windows were replaced. A new electric service was installed. New floors, walls and ceilings were constructed. The facade was spiffed up, including a striking awning. New tables, chairs and a countertop were bought.</p>
<p>The restaurant reopened with a spate of publicity, including a ribbon-cutting last December in which Mayor Byron W. Brown, a frequent customer, declared: &#8220;I&rsquo;m very pleased to contribute to this very worthy effort.&#8221;</p>

The Buffalo News has been doing a number of articles on the distribution of money in Buffalo, particularly to minority businesses.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another about the Hispanic west side:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yds6jcj" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yds6jcj</a></p>
<p>My local south Buffalo councilman ran against the current black mayor in the primary.</p>
<p>He lost and south Buffalo received no founding in the current budget. That&rsquo;s zero.</p>
<p>Blacks are forever complaining they don&rsquo;t get their fair share. They get more than their fair share. The problem is the money is only given to those who are connected. That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing so long as they use the money to better the community. In black communities, the money just disappears with no benefits to show.</p>
<p>A few years back, MLK park was given 1.5 million refurbish a turn of the century fountain. The fountain is still in disrepair and the money was never accounted for. Of course, they&rsquo;re asking for more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost track of the number of community centers that were desperately needed, built, and funded to curtail violence on the black east side. The east side still has the highest rates of murder and violent crime.</p>

		<p>Not surprising at all.  Many towns have to put up with &#8220;historic black institutions&#8221; that are nothing more than a funnel for taxpayer money to be dumped.  We have an &#8220;historic&#8221; black college where I live that has made plenty of plugged-in blacks very rich through all of the local and federal funds that have been dumped into it.  </p>

		<p>im from buffalo too, it used to be a mob run town and its is still now but a different mob, and the corruption is palpable.  However the unions,liberals, and his eastside constituency just voted Brown back in office.  Republicans havent fielded a candidate as long as i can remember.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be quite interested in hearing about a white restaurant, an eatery &#8216;doubling as a sort of communal kitchen table for the white community&rsquo; being written about in such a glowing manner by this same paper, even written about at all. </p>

<p>failure to pay? Oh, my! What white wouldn&rsquo;t be prosecuted for fraud, theft and tax evasion? What&rsquo;s wrong with my fellow whites?!?</p>

		<p>And whom does this sort of conduct by blacks surprise? I&rsquo;m sort of surprised the tax offices messed with blacks in the first place, usually career ending choice for White public service workers and other White professionals.</p>
