<h1>&#8216;Caucasian&rsquo; Clause Causes Myers Park Uproar</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ely Portillo, Charlotte Observer, December 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The state and local NAACP on Monday blasted the Myers Park Homeowners Association for a discriminatory deed restriction published on its Web site.</p>
<p>The dispute could end up in court if the two sides don&rsquo;t reach some sort of agreement  &mdash;  possibly including a financial payment that some estimate could reach $50,000  &mdash;  within 30 days.</p>
<p>The NAACP filed a complaint in 2007 against the association for posting a sample deed that included a decades-old clause specifying that &#8220;people of the Caucasian race only&#8221; could live in or own a Myers Park house.</p>
<p>The complaint was filed with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Community Relations Committee, which investigates claims of housing discrimination. Last week, the committee ruled that the Myers Park association was responsible for publishing a discriminatory statement and told the two parties to negotiate a settlement.</p>
<p>Although the deed was removed from the Web site more than a year ago, the NAACP is seeking penalties that could include a financial payment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ken Davies, an attorney representing the Myers Park Homeowners Association, told WCNC-TV, the Observer&rsquo;s news partner, that the clause is nearly a century old, is illegal, and has not been enforced.</p>
<p>Davies told WCNC that the NAACP&rsquo;s demands, which have not been publicly released, are &#8220;outrageous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president of the Myers Park Homeowners Association issued a public apology Monday, saying {snip} &#8220;We published it solely to alert homeowners about setbacks and other restrictions for modifying their homes,&#8221; Pamela May told the Observer. {snip}</p>
<p>The association acknowledged the language posted in the sample deed is offensive, but said it didn&rsquo;t have the authority to change wording recorded almost 100 years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;To those who read and were offended, we apologize,&#8221; her statement said. &#8220;The Myers Park Homeowners Association has never attempted to discriminate against anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parties have about a month to reach a settlement before additional measures  &mdash;  such as a lawsuit  &mdash;  could be taken. Barber said the NAACP is ready to &#8220;go to the mat&#8221; on this &#8220;Jim Crow activity,&#8221; but wouldn&rsquo;t say exactly what the group is seeking.</p>
<p>An initial settlement proposal sought thousands of dollars in payments to the local NAACP branch as a penalty, according to Barber, but is no longer the proposal being discussed.</p>
<p>However, WCNC says it has learned that the NAACP is seeking financial payments that could reach $50,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barber [William Barber, president of the state NAACP] said the issue is bigger than an outdated racist clause in a deed, and that patterns of housing segregation that resulted continue to affect school quality and neighborhoods today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Stella Adams, a fair housing advocate with the NAACP, {snip} told WCNC [WCNC-TV, the Observer&rsquo;s news partner] that a study of residences in Myers Park proves that segregation has taken place. She produced pie charts, showing just a small percentage of minorities live in Myers Park, compared to much larger populations elsewhere in the city.<br>

		<p>The kind of restrictive covenant mentioned here can be found not only in the South but in many other parts of the country as well. It represents an example of the right to free association.</p>
<p>If people who wanted to live among their own kind could do so, it would actually go a long way toward reducing racial friction. One reason for all the bad blood nowadays is that whites are sick of having to live next door to people they don&rsquo;t want as neighbors.</p>

		<p>Instead of worrying about a century-old document that was accidentally reproduced online, why don&rsquo;t they tend to the C.B.C. - which actively discriminates against Caucasians and Asians to this very day?  What will it take for a person of influence and stature to point out to them their hypocrisy?</p>

<p>Well Barker doesn&rsquo;t know how right he would be with that assertion. All that&rsquo;s lacking to perfect his assertion is to change &#8220;housing segregation&#8221; to &#8220;housing integration&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Why should whites be forced to live with blacks when blacks don&rsquo;t even want to live with each other.Funny how segregation makes all white areas better,and all black areas worse.Someone needs to tell blacks they are free now,and with freedom comes the possibility of failure,and to take responsibility for any corrective measures required to improve themselves.</p>

		<p>To live in Myers Park, you must have a ton of money or a very high paying job.</p>
<p>Not too many colored folks have either, and that is why they do not live in Myers Park.</p>
<p>Sitting around with a forty ounce is not what gets you into a neighborhood like that, black OR white. Many more white folks are willing to do the work it takes to get there. Very few of the colored folks are.</p>

		<p>Good think the NAACP is concentrating on this 100 year old document that is holding blacks down.  That document has been proven to cause blacks to have an illegitimacy rate of 70%, cause black males to commit over 50% of the nation&rsquo;s violent crimes and put more black males in prison than in college.  Well done, NAACP!</p>

		<p>Could it be that the majority of minority residents cannot afford to live in that neighborhood? Upper income blacks have set up neighborhoods where they live with their own kind. For example, in South Dekalb County in Atlanta, there is a subdivision, where houses go from 400,000 to about 1 million dollars. This neighborhood is just about all black. The residents range from professionals to entertainers and athletes.</p>

		<p>So an oranization (NAACP) that has nothing to do with the situation, delved into records to find some sort of club with which to beat/bludgeon/extort money from White homeowners found something! Now these people can expect several of the vacant homes (if there are any) to be classed and usurped as Section 8 housing and there goes the community. Seen it before. The apologies and groveling by Whites that had nothing to do with the caucasian only words is disgusting. BTW! racial realism is certainly spreading in the military.</p>

<p>You are excatly right Big Daddy. You must know something about the Charlotte area. Myers Park is a very nice neighborhood, and I don&rsquo;t think they will give in to these absurd demands from the NAACP. They have the money to fight this, and it would be worth every penny to stand up for themselves.</p>
<p>It makes me shake with anger when these fools call it  segregation, just because blacks can&rsquo;t afford to live there. A lot of whites I know can&rsquo;t afford to either. Does hard work and working hard mean nothing in this country anymore? </p>

<p>I was guessing &#8216;Myers Park&rsquo; was now an area completely overrun by Mexicans or African Americans. I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t have served their purpose to have such a deed &#8216;accidently&rsquo; show up on the internet and be brought out into the light. Actually, with the selective news we have now. That would probably serve the NAACP too. </p>

<p>They do. Try moving your family to the African side of town, or even visiting. Of course, what was once yours is now their too. They want integration with us, when it serves their purpose or whenever they would like it, and exclusivity for themselves. <br>

<p>SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;the homeowners will loose and shortly thereafter will be section 8 housing and HUD in the area and we know what comes after that. The only other thing to be determined is how much will the NAACP and ACORN gain from this AND where the Whites are going to move to.</p>

Interesting.  I wonder if that&rsquo;s being done elsewhere.<br>
I know that my mother&rsquo;s house had such a clause (from about the 1930s) which I saw written in it many years ago. Of course, the Civil Rights laws annulled the validity of such clauses.<br>
I wonder if other states are now erasing them as well.</p>

		<p>Regardless of its merits, the restrictive covenant is illegal under current law and unenforceable.  So there is only one reason why the NAACP is threatening to sue   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re in it for the money.  Is anyone surprised?</p>

<p>Indeed, the quality of schools and neighborhoods is better in towns that had restricted covenants and still have the racial balance that resulted from those covenants.  A politically inconvenient fact, but true.<br>

		<p>JFK and Jackie Kennedy once bought a house in D.C. that had a restrictive covenant.  What&rsquo;s wrong with posting a 100-year-old document no matter what it contains?  I&rsquo;m sure that there are black-run websites that have all kinds of historical records of slaves being bought and sold, slaves being given their freedom, blacks signing up to serve in all-black regiments.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem here is not WHAT was posted, but who posted it.</p>

		<p>This just shows that all such strategies are merely desperate, temporary stopgap measures. You can have all the covenants you want; in the long run they will be meaningless and will be over-ridden.  Laws can be re-written, covenants can be declared void, rules and regulations can be changed. Nothing is permanent.  Nothing short of complete racial separation/removal will be effective in the long run.      </p>

		<p>All this talk amongst yourselves is speaking words to those who already know them by heart.  With such a sympathetic audience I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t be plain about it: none of you like black people.  The content of the article doesn&rsquo;t matter, you&rsquo;d find some way or another of explaining the bigotry away.</p>
<p>And, no, you can&rsquo;t make segregation legal again.  Economics does a pretty good job of segregating anyway.  The fact that you delight in it, however, is very unAmerican.  Freedom, in the American sense, is not about living as you see fit to the exclusion of others.  You are all so fearful.</p>

		<p>A number of years ago, there was a &#8220;sixty minutes&#8221; segment on housing which compared two identical subdivisions, one predominantly white and one black.  Discussions were held with some of the homeowners in both subdivisions.  No racial animosity was noted (however, the &#8220;sixty minutes&#8221; crew expected animosity from whites).<br>
The (unintentional) coup-de-grace came when the &#8220;sixty minutes&#8221; interviewer admitted that housing prices in the (identical) all-black subdivision were approximately 20 percent cheaper.</p>
