<h1>Albertson&rsquo;s to Pay $8.9M in Colorado Bias Lawsuits</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ivan Moreno, Google News, December 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Albertson&rsquo;s LLC grocery chain will pay $8.9 million to 168 black and Hispanic workers who said they were subjected to racial taunts and a graffiti-laced restroom depicting lynchings and swastikas, federal officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The money is part of a settlement agreement between Albertson&rsquo;s and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which represented the workers in three lawsuits involving the company&rsquo;s warehouse distribution center in suburban Denver.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The settlement will be distributed among 168 former and current employees, the EEOC said. Individual payments will range from $4,500 to several hundred thousand dollars, depending on factors such as number of years worked and severity of harassment, said Mary Jo O&rsquo;Neill, regional EEOC attorney.</p>
<p>The agency said black and Hispanic workers were repeatedly the targets of racial slurs. The graffiti in the restroom also included white supremacist and anti-immigrant statements, according to the first lawsuit filed in 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supervisors knew about the harassment and participated in it, EEOC attorneys said.</p>
<p>Albertson&rsquo;s LLC spokeswoman Christine Wilcox said the company maintains that the allegations of racial discrimination happened before it took over operations at the distribution center in June 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Neill disputed Albertson&rsquo;s timeframe, saying the company or one of its affiliates operated the center for several years prior to June 2006. Albertson&rsquo;s LLC is based in Boise, Idaho, and operates almost 250 stores in seven states, including Colorado, Arizona, Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The EEOC filed two other discrimination lawsuits against Albertson&rsquo;s LLC last year involving the same distribution center. In one complaint, several workers alleged they were passed over for promotions, given harder jobs and fired in retaliation for complaining about being harassed.</p>

		<p>Harrassment &amp; discrimination are inexcuseable. But the bathroom graffiti stuff is just silly. Blacks and hispanics are complaining about graffiti? Really? Think about it. Besides, half the men&rsquo;s bathrooms in the country have a limerick starting with &#8220;there once was a man from nantucket&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>Conveniently, the graffiti is in a restroom, where, for privacy reasons, there can be no spy cams or surveillance cameras.  That&rsquo;s one of the prime elements of a racial hoax, a contention that is impossible to be corroborated, or where there are no witnesses. </p>
<p>I anxiously await the day that Albertson&rsquo;s files for bankruptcy.  The reason they will go out of business because every black or tan civil rights hustler is about to bleed them dry, because Albertson&rsquo;s is too stupid or gutless to fight a lawsuit.  I&rsquo;m just a shmuk in flyover country, and I just told you their obvious defense.  Evidently, the dozens of lawyers they hire, plus the CEO, and multiplicity of Vice-Presidents, and various other manager types   &mdash;   none of them could pick up on this.  </p>

		<p>At some of their stores, there appears to be a no Whites need apply policy, so I can only guess who is responsible for the graffiti. Perhaps it is the two groups who seem to have a natural flair for producing it. I believe the key to the mystery is this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Settlements this size don&rsquo;t come down the pipe everyday,&#8221; said Andrew Winston, the EEOC attorney who handled the cases.</p>

<p>This just never ends does it! It would apparently be better for companies to just pay these &#8220;minorities&#8221; to stay home and never show up since they cannot get away with choosing NOT to hire them. </p>

		<p>The EEOC has no credibility whatsoever and I don&rsquo;t believe for a second that events transpired as told in this article.  I do know, however, that whites are subject to ongoing harassment by blacks and Hispanics within many companies and government agencies.  What is the EEOC doing about that?</p>

		<p>I used to work for the Santa Fe Railroad.  I was personally acquainted with 2 Mexican engineers who were literally worthless, but couldn&rsquo;t be fired because they claimed racist discrimination.  One was so incompetent that he always had a real engineer along (Called a &#8220;pilot&#8221; in RR terminology) to keep him on the rails.  The other was always trying scam his way into a soft job.  That&rsquo;s hard to do because seniority is everything on the railroad.  Eventually he was able to claim emotional disability because his train had once killed some idiot on the tracks.  After a while he got a very low-level paperwork job with an engineer&rsquo;s pay, because he &#8220;couldn&rsquo;t&#8221; bear to be on a train.  When I hear a minority say &#8220;discrimination&#8221;, I think &#8220;parasite&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Graffiti in the restroom? It may have been the last remnants of free speech. I remember quite a lot of that in the army (g).<br>
Or, it may have been another noose hoax, erm, private initiative in the ghetto lottery.<br>

		<p>One of the advantages of allowing our federal government to go bankrupt and then dissolve (which is going to happen very, very soon, if we want to allow it or not) is there will not be any &#8220;federal officials&#8221; to use our laws in such a way as to loot a company for something like this.</p>
<p>Three will be places in the US where the people and institutions allow this behavior.  And places where they do not.  Both the workers and the company will have CHOICE where they want to live.</p>
<p>Choice, of this nature, will be the beginning of the empowerment and rebuilding of our way of life.</p>

		<p>Since there is no video surveillance in bathrooms, anyone, including the alleged &#8220;victims&#8221; themselves could have drawn those offensive images and words. Large companies will be quick to settle to avoid bad publicity..a classic blackmail scam&hellip;just one of the downsides to diversity&hellip;</p>

		<p>  I dislike graffiti in public restrooms. Sometimes, I read vulgar comments that upset me. Does that entitle me to thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars for hurt feelings? At most, I&rsquo;m entitled to an apology from the management and maybe a free gift certificate. I work in higher education and it&rsquo;s almost impossible to keep offensive graffiti from appearing on restroom walls. The janitors erase it and the students keep putting it back.</p>

		<p>QD  &mdash;   You may not have long to wait to see Albertson&rsquo;s go under. The one in our neighborhood just changed their name to &#8220;Neighborhood Market&#8221; or some other similar moniker. I guess the situation is so touchy that even though there is no evidence that the people did not write the grafitti themselves the owners are so afraid of getting the shake down attention of Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson that they knuckled under. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not.  it cuts into profits to feed black and hispanics with a racist mentality.  In fact, if companies didn&rsquo;t have the fear of lawsuits or boycotts, racist hispanics and racist blacks like you would have to actually work for your money. </p>

		<p>As to #13 Juan&rsquo;s post; I hope you know what the poor professional victims suing cost in real terms. This country can&rsquo;t stand any more of this nonsense. Is it o.k. to call a white a &#8220;Paddy, cracker, honky, etc.&#8221; but not let a white respond in kind? As long as we have a freedom af speech someone will be offended. I am offended by illegals and lazy people living of my labor.And to mke it perfectly clear, my ancestors came from Holland ( The Netherlands ) around the time of WWI. We had to change our name to an English sounding name because of discrimintion.We learned English, assimilated, and got on with the American way of life. We didn&rsquo;t want to be treated special, just to live and breath free air.Be American and contribute to the American way af life. </p>

		<p>Without DOJ resources, this lawsuit would have gone nowhere. In fact, I doubt if it even would have been occured.</p>
<p>Note that the lawsuit was initiated under the Bush II administration. This is the administration that the Liberals classify as Racist and unwilling use the vast power of the DOJ to fight Racism. </p>
<p>An Alberson&rsquo;s opened up in my area a few years ago, it embraced Diversity, then closed up for lack of business.</p>

		<p>Every time we apply for a job, with the cover letter, without being asked, also send a contract you have signed in which you agree to pay them any money you win from then in such lawsuits regarding non-threatening harassment. Might as well also include some certified results of an IQ test you have taken.  Give them all the things that could help you get the job, but for which the employer is not allowed to ask.</p>
