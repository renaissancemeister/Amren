<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/us/08census.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Census Finds Rise in Foreign Workers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Roberts, New York Times, December 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because of government barriers to immigration, the share of foreign-born workers dipped from a 20th-century high of 21 percent in 1910 to barely 5 percent in 1970, but has been rising since then, to the current 16 percent.</p>
<p>In 2007, immigrants accounted for more than one in four workers in California (35 percent), New York (27 percent), New Jersey (26 percent) and Nevada (25 percent).</p>
<p>For the first time, the Census Bureau also compared immigrants by generation. Generally, income and other measures of achievement rose from one generation to the next, although educational attainment peaked with the second generation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Similarly, the overall proportion of immigrant families living below the government&rsquo;s official poverty level declined, from 16.5 percent to 14.5 to 11.5 among three generations. But among adult immigrants, the proportion who are poor grew again between the second and third generations.</p>
<p>While the proportion of high school graduates increased from one generation to the next, the share who had bachelor&rsquo;s degrees or more higher education declined from the second to the third generations. The proportion with doctorates peaked with the first generation.</p>

		<p>Considering that unemployment rates are at record levels, it would be a good idea to implement an immigration moratorium. It isn&rsquo;t good to have foreign workers take the jobs that many Americans need.</p>

If the common economic logic is that immigration is good for economies, why should any nation with large immigrant populations ever suffer economic down turns?</p>

		<p>Well, I can see that Social Security will be on the chopping block very soon. These &#8220;workers&#8221; will never pay what Whites have been paying since the nation was formed. Especially if it goes towards any White person. It is okay for us to support them and all their families for years but let us not ask for the same in return.</p>

		<p>There are two unemployment figures used. The low one and the real one. The real one is over 18%. We don&rsquo;t need 1/6 of American workers to be foreign born in this economy. Trust me I know. Been unemployed for three years now.</p>

		<p>We need a moratorium on ALL immigration.   There is no excuse to continue to allow foreign workers to flood into this country when our own people are out of work.</p>
<p>Check out Patrick Buchanan&rsquo;s recent column on the subject:</p>

		<p>Unemployment is at its highest level in 30+ years and I anticipate it will continue to rise.  </p>
<p>Essentially what the US has done since the 1960s is import as many people from the third-world as possible while simultaneously exporting our manufacturing jobs to those same countries.  I am not a conspiracy theorist per se, but if you were to draw up a plan to destroy the US, this would be the blueprint to use.<br>

<p>   You can say that again. Why do we need immigration with 10% unemployment?  Who is getting the Obama jobs? Is Obama even a friend of blacks with 15% black unemployment. </p>

		<p>I was at a well traveled McDonald&rsquo;s and I asked the immigrant behind the counter for onion rings and the reply, in halting english, was &#8220;onion rings&hellip;what&rsquo;s that?&#8221;  Geez.  </p>
