<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police charged six Hesser College students with felony riot early Tuesday morning when confronted with 50 screaming students while answering a call about an out-of-control fight, police said.</p>
<p>The incident took place during finals week, and the six students, three of them women, appeared in Manchester District Court Tuesday. Five face additional misdemeanors such as assault or resisting arrest. All were held on $1,000 cash or surety bail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an issue of people who were observed breaking the law. They were arrested and that&rsquo;s what it is,&#8221; Mara said. &#8220;This has nothing to do with race. It has to do with breaking the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to police reports, one student punched an officer, another wrestled with an officer, 50 students were screaming, and many refused to clear the hallway when ordered to do so. One had a camera and demanded to see and photograph badge numbers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students said police pushed through the crowded hallway and called them animals. They threw students to the floor, striking and kicking them.</p>
<p>&#8220;These students were outraged. That&rsquo;s your riot,&#8221; said a student from Randolph, Mass., who did not want his name printed. He said police acted as if they were responding to a bar fight, rather than a place of higher learning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mara [Police Chief David Mara] said Officer Daniel Doherty was punched in the face but will return to work. Officer Jake Tyler&rsquo;s right finger was dislocated and his right hand left swollen; he will be out of work until the injury heals, Mara said.</p>
<p>According to police, the incident took place shortly after 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. College security was unable to control a fight in the dorm. Police reports say two Hesser College staff were injured; one security officer may have suffered a broken nose.</p>
<p>The six arrested were:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Shamika Sanders, 23, of Hyde Park [Mass.], charged with riot and resisting arrest. Police allege she was yelling and taking photographs but would not go to her room when told to do so. She also photographed the injured security officer and blocked the room where he was being treated, reports say.</p>
<p>Sanders allegedly tried to swat away the hands of an officer who tried to arrest her. She was brought to the ground; police said three officers were required to put Sanders on her stomach and handcuff her.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Dave Virgle, 22, of Randolph [Mass.], charged with riot, resisting arrest and two counts of simple assault on a police officer. Police allege that Virgle pushed Officer Doherty in the chest and punched him in the face while 50 students were yelling in the hallway.</p>
<p>Virgle allegedly cocked his right arm back as if he was going to punch Officer Matthew J. Winn, but was put on the ground and handcuffed after a minute-long struggle, according to police reports.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Edouard Beaupin, 21, of Randolph [Mass.], for riot, felony resisting arrest and two charges of assault on a police officer.</p>
<p>Police allege Beaupin told Doherty not to arrest his cousin, and he pushed both Doherty and Officer Tyler. Both Beaupin and Tyler wrestled on the ground, and when other police intervened, Beaupin resisted attempts to be handcuffed. He was eventually pepper-sprayed.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Momah Massaquoi, who turned 20 Monday, from Brockton [Mass.], charged with riot and resisting arrest. Police said he refused to leave the hallway when told to do so and refused to put his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>Police say when they put him on the ground, he struggled and was pepper-sprayed.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Barbara Jean-Baptiste, 20, of Mattapan [Mass.], for riot and resisting arrest. Police allege she screamed at people and police after several others had been arrested. Police allege she refused to quiet down and leave the area when told to do so. She allegedly pulled her arm away when police walked her out of the building.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Kinisha French, 23, of Mattapan [Mass.], charged with riot. Police said French allegedly refused to withdraw from a break room. She was arrested in a dorm room after she continued her loud behavior, police said.</p>
<p>All are scheduled for a Dec. 29 court hearing; all asked for public defenders.</p>

		<p>Ah, yes.  Good old N.H., the bastian of liberalism.  I wonder how they like diversity now? </p>
<p>Too, I&rsquo;m wondering how Maine is faring with their gifted Somalis who had to learn how to flush the toilet.</p>
<p>And those posters on here who pointed out that black women are not desired by many black men, because of their disgusting personalities, were right.</p>
<p>The above incident tells us much.  And, here&rsquo;s an example of a highly intelligent black woman who thinks she can catch a vehicle at 30 miles an hour just by running after it.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Students said police pushed through the crowded hallway and called them animals. They threw students to the floor, striking and kicking them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I have my suspicions that most of that is untrue, because blacks are known to embellish police &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; quite a bit. This is particularly true when they hope to avoid punishment for their crimes, or smell the potential to seek monetary &ldquo;damages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, given the details of the kinds of injuries the police officers sustained, even if all that these blacks are alleging is true, it still sounds fully justified. Blacks have an amazing capacity for unrestrained mob violence, that only the shock of determined retaliatory aggression seems to be able control. That is simply a sad fact of life, when it comes to dealing with a berserk and rioting herd of blacks!</p>
<p>Had their riots in the 60s and beyond been contained with such reasonable countermeasures, we would likely not have most of the out of control criminal activity that we see today. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I was in Manchester about a decade ago and parts of it were already ghetto-ized then. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it actually. The hotel I was in was in a part of town scarcely better than you find in NY, NJ, etc. Every corner of this nation is being fouled with &#8220;diversity.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure that this, Hesser College, is one of those campuses where people like &#8216;us&rsquo; would be shouted down and thrown off campus [ if we could even GET on campus ] as vile racists. Of course the clueless Whites there will all stand behind the blacks [ don&rsquo;t want to appear racissss ] and against the police. I predict that candle sales in the area will go through the roof for all the anti-racist rallies that will be planned not only on campus, but thru-out Manchester, and the police involved will, at the very least, have to take diversity classes. The thugs involved will become the &#8220;Manchester Six&#8221; and be worshiped on campus as &#8220;civil rights foot solders&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I checked out this so-called college. It is actually a for profit trade school offering &#8220;associates&#8221; degrees in things like massage therapy. It is not really a college but a &#8220;tech&#8221; school that is loaded with Pell grant students, i.e. kids that can&rsquo;t make it anywhere else. Recruiters for places like this clean out the ghettos for minority students who qualify for lots of government loans and grants. The &#8220;college&#8221; makes lots of money but few if any of the grads ever do much, plus a huge percentage default on their loans. It&rsquo;s nothing more than one more rat hole that taxpayer money is sucked into.</p>

		<p>The reaction might be, if they are so upset, why don&rsquo;t they move to another country. But when the 6 students have the names of Edouard Beaupin, Kinisha French, Shamika Sanders, Dave Virgle, Barbara Jean-Baptiste and Momah Massaquoi, it&rsquo;s clear they already are living in another country. </p>

If the police did treat them like animals it&rsquo;s because they were likely acting like animals.</p>
<p>The police responded to the level of provocation they&rsquo;re threatened with. If these people had remained orderly when the police arrived to assess the situation, the police wouldn&rsquo;t have had to react.<br>

<p>No doubt one of those &#8220;hefty&#8221; ladies of color. </p>
<p>I have personally witnessed the described behaviour of the blacks in this story, in my area. More than once. Very loud and obnoxious behaviour that escalated into a mini riot. The stories I read later in the papers were ridiculous and far from accurate. The blacks claimed they were innocent bystanders minding their own buisness when the police started harrassing them for no reason. And of course the writer took the side of and slanted the story in the favor of these &#8220;victims&#8221;. </p>
<p>I am the last person in the world that would back big brother filming our every move. But one good outcome of having a camara on every block is to capture the violent behaviour of blacks. IMO, this behaviour captured on film and posted on YouTube and the like, will be #1 on the list of things that will eventually awaken sleeping Whites and turn the tide. Imagine having the events in the above article on tape for all to see. Then, like most who frequent this site, others would see the &#8220;real&#8221; story too.</p>

 In all fairness Ranger, I think you would agree that we all, at some point in life, had to learn to flush a toilet. Speaking of toilets, I saw a program on what a miracle they really are. They operate without the need for electricity, as long as there is water available. Never really thought about that&hellip; </p>

<p>Ha!  That&rsquo;s a good one;  and so true too. In fact, in twenty years, there&rsquo;ll be a hall or library named for them, the sainted martyrs of 2009.  In another thirty years, maybe one of them will even be running the school. (Maybe even sitting in the White House!)</p>
<p>BTW,  I notice that ALL of these sterling scholars are FROM MASSACHUSETTS, not from New Hampshire.  Every one!   I wonder how that happens?  So please, people, don&rsquo;t blame New Hampshire for these feral animals.  Blame Massachusetts!  And I wish, if only, the fire-breathing abolitionists of Massachusetts could be alive today to see the wondrous fruits of their good intentions   &mdash;   after the deaths of 620,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilians [Wiki].  And now, little more than a century later, they have the results of their holy war right in their own backyard. Serves &#8216;em right.  (Damn misguided busybody fools!)</p>

		<p>Certainly not the New Hampshire I&rsquo;m familiar with&hellip;</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics numbers have definetely gained over the last decade but only in limited areas. Even if these six miscreants graduated from Hesser, its highly unlikely they&rsquo;d stay in NH. Ain&rsquo;t really no hood up there,-too many white people.</p>
<p>Presently, NH is just under ninty- five percent white, which might not be entirely accurate. Students and prisoners for example, are counted amongst the population which might artificially inflate the percentage of minorities. Keep in mind  that almost all non-whites in the state exist in either Concord, Manchester and lesser numbers in Keene/Nashua.   </p>
<p>White demographics, the history/culture of the region, its ruralness and lack of minority social service programs means that NH will not become a New Jersey anytime soon. </p>
<p>Thank God for that!</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing&hellip; this constant [mis]behavior by Blacks, whether students or not, is as predictable as the time of tomorrow&rsquo;s sunrise. Only Blacks would go to college; then end up in a dormitory riot. Go figure.</p>
<p>Maybe I missed it, but what was the cause of the riot?</p>

		<p>Typically the town police do not interfere with campus civil issues unless invited onto the campus by the campus police.  From the article it seems there was a disturbance the campus police tried and couldn&rsquo;t handle, and then called the local police due the seriousness.  Riots usually involve injury and the police err on the side of swift action and the use of force.  While not perfect it minimizes injuries for all.  A stand off with the police where they are perceived to hesitate or weaken only emboldens the rioters.  Conversely, if the rioters had seriously hurt others and the police were not called there would be suits as well.  Perhaps it would be best for society to declare a moratorium on police/campus interdiction activities for 6 months and wait for the howls in demand for protection.</p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve told folks on here before, this riot is an African tactic that dates back to the late 1960&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Knowing that they&rsquo;ve goofed off all semester and have had circles run around them by Whites and Asians, Africans seek to short-circuit the ultimate sorting process: the final exam.</p>
<p>If they can shut down finals, they figure that pointy-headed lib White profs will have to &#8216;give&rsquo; them some sort of decent passing grade in lieu of the hard scrutiny that an exam brings to bear.</p>

		<p>I did some research on Hesser &#8220;College&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s one of those places that&rsquo;s endlessly advertised on COPS or Wildest Police Videos.</p>
<p>Whenever a school has multiple campuses (as HC does) it&rsquo;s a dead giveaway that it&rsquo;s a &#8220;give us your dough and then off you go&#8221; kind of place.  These institutions ALWAYS plaster film of minorities on their ads so as to recruit the youfs of da hood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to be confused with Rutgers, Purdue, Nore Dame or some other formerly reputable school. </p>
<p>Our wonderful federal government has a Job Corps station (on the order of Hesser College) in an abandoned high school west of us and the coppers are always getting called there.  Yes, it&rsquo;s because some misunderstood youth of color has taken out his frustration on another youth of color who is equally frustrated.</p>

Why is it that everywhere, and I mean everywhere on line, AMRen to you Tube&hellip; people resort to name calling ansd accusing other people of being not with the program as much as they are. I`m guilty of it too and I started it, maybe out of boredom between waitng for the next days posts, but there has to be a better way than challenging other peoples sincerity or devotion? to the cause when they don`t agree with another poster or point out, maybe incorrectly the holes in their argument. I vow to stop today! right now! Anybody else with me? Peace brother! I`m just as aware as you, I promise. Bartending at a bus statioon bar will do that to you&hellip;</p>

<p>Your sincerity or your devotion weren&rsquo;t challenged, Tim.</p>
<p>By excusing their lack of civilization (these are part of the same mobs who killed our rangers and dragged their dead bodies through the streets)you&rsquo;re making a tacit insinuation that we should be more accepting of them. </p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t be here and certainly they deserve no quarter.<br>

<p>No, not French names &hellip; only two. And possibly a third (Virgile).  [Massaquoi is an obvious attempt to say Massaquoit, the American Indian.]<br>
Haitian?  Yes, very likely; but they are all from Mass., not from NH. <br>

<p>Well said Sir. </p>
<p>The thing is this I think. People can no longer abide disagreement in any way. As soon as they hear a different viewpoint, they become enraged. In my own wonderings around the net, I&rsquo;ve learned to be very mannerly, no matter how much I disagree with whomsoever I&rsquo;m debating. I&rsquo;ve found this approach very unnerving to my adversaries. The more I treat them with courtesy, the more enraged they become. Sometimes even bringing down the moderator on them because of their out of control language. However, I&rsquo;m not advocating courtesy to enrage people. I&rsquo;m just pointing out it&rsquo;s effect.</p>
<p>Another point if I may. I&rsquo;m a letter to the editor writer and I&rsquo;ve found that if I make my points in question form, many times I baffle the censors at a paper (not the sharpest tacks in the box) and they print my letters even though I&rsquo;m saying things the liberal rags absolutely disagree with. Possibly, you could use this technique on the net in your exchnges.</p>
<p>You bring up an excellent point Tim McHugh.</p>

<p>It might be worse than 1980s Poland.  At least there and then, they had a real resistance movement bolstered by Papal imprimatur.  People talk about Reagan and Thatcher, but I think JP II deserves the most credit for toppling communism.  From my reading of the history (though I was alive in the 1980s, one can&rsquo;t expect a child and preteen to grasp the subtle nuances of history and interpretation), JP II&rsquo;s endorsement of Solidarity was the spark that brought everything down.</p>

<p>Where have you perceived any enragement here, Tom?  Can you give me a quote?  With all due respect the statement sounds just a bit delusional.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read your posts on other sites, Tom.  Remember when you were trying to get people to help you out on a liberal site, because you were being overwhelmed?</p>
<p>Well, I went to the site and read your posts.  You were being insulted and denigrated and the more you meekly contributed the worse it got, specifically because you were almost groveling to those people.  </p>
<p>Your timidity emboldened them to the point where they lost respect for you and your viewpoint entirely.  You became more like a whipping boy for the liberals, than a source offerring vigorous debate.  I wanted to let you know that and asked you to contact me, giving my email address, but you never contacted me.</p>
<p>I never bothered about posting in order to help you out, because it would have done no good to offer points in rebuttal when you were apologizing everytime you timidly offerred an opposing point of view.  It was painful to read a WN take that kind of position.</p>
<p>The position of meekness you seem to be telling us is effective for you is really detrimental to your arguments, if they can be called that.  You want to call it being mannerly and courteous, but it comes across to the opposition as abject weakness.  You&rsquo;re not unnerving them.  You&rsquo;re encouraging them, because they&rsquo;re absolutely delighted to vent their pent up rage on someone they know won&rsquo;t fight back.</p>
<p>Your methods make all WN&rsquo;s look really bad when you post on liberal sites.</p>

<p>Why bother trolling the kook lib websites?  They are who they are, the reasons they are are well out of our control.  Arguing with them is like trying to teach a pig to whistle, the pig won&rsquo;t whistle, and you&rsquo;ll get high blood pressure.  If they are to become one of us, it will only be through experience, i.e. being mugged by reality.</p>

		<p>My annoying wandering off topic on both toilets and hostility to others, made me want to relate a final story that had me going  Hmmm..  a while back. It was one of those  human interest stories you always find buried in the middle of page 16A. It was titled &#8220;Never Married Man Donates Entire Fortune To Curing Little Researched Medical Condition&#8221;  It went on to tell how a reclusive self made man donated his whole 160 million dollar fortune  toward understanding and finding a cure for &hellip;Bedwetting!! <br>
  And I said to myself, the real story behind the story  is what happened on the playground  between 1934 and 36&hellip;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t &#8220;troll&#8221; the lib web sites, guy.</p>
<p>In the few times I&rsquo;ve went on a lib web site it has been to help out someone who asked for help, or on the comments section of a college newspaper to give the students views they&rsquo;ve never heard before, which has been suprisingly effective for me at times. I&rsquo;ve been to SPLC&rsquo;s site a few times to rattle their cages and get them upset. </p>
<p>Once, myself and several Amren posters ventured over to the web site of a school who had a professor who was making general denigrations that were reported in their school paper.</p>
<p>I submitted hate quotes from both Hispanics and blacks, obtained from Amren and American Patrol.  I could tell it had an effect on some of the kids, because their opposition dwindled off to just a couple posters.  Too, I might add that their arguments are easy to refute even without examples, like anti-white hate quotes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal for us is to get as many of our like minded people reading AR and joining similar organizations as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that would be an excellent goal, but we also have to look at things realistically.  The other organizations I belong too are up in arms and are actively protesting this administration&rsquo;s policies; however, they aren&rsquo;t ready yet to enter into the racial arena.  While they WILL come around eventually, the leftist policy of effectively intimidating anyone who involves himself with race, keeps a large number from committing themselves just yet, and, quite frankly, that&rsquo;s understandable.  I imagine there are many &#8220;anonymous&#8221; posters on here who are part of the Patriot movement, the tea party crowd and others.</p>

		<p>The real issue here involves a bunch of black ingrates who are out to protest anything and everything, because some black self-appointed leader told them they were the victims of injustice.  Well, NH brought this on themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;  &mdash;    &mdash;  - the leftist policy of effectively intimidating anyone who involves himself with race, keeps a large number from committing themselves just yet, and, quite frankly, that&rsquo;s understandable. I imagine there are many &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; posters on here who are part of the Patriot movement, the tea party crowd and others.&#8221;</p>
<p>I imagine there are also, because I&rsquo;m one of them.  All handles no matter what they are, besides real names of course, are anonymous.  It&rsquo;s an excellent method of guerilla warfare.</p>
<p>And, to the people above who are advocating this and that as a way to help this org let me just quote another poster:  &#8220;It&rsquo;s not really necessary to do anything except to remain in communication, because the situation has deteriorated all on its own and will continue to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>And to the above poster who gave us visual evidence of more deplorable black female behavior, thanks for the video:<br>
