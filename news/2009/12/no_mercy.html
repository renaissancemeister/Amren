<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Japan is hardly a multicultural state, but the killing of British Nova teacher Lindsay Hawker in 2007 brings up many of the same issues that arise with interracial killings back home. Any failure to see justice done or tendency to treat the killer differently can lead to a whole community  &mdash;  even the majority  &mdash;  feeling aggrieved and alienated. This is the situation the foreign community now finds itself in following the arrest of the suspected killer Tatsuya Ichihashi.</p>
<p>So far, the fact that Lindsay was an attractive foreign woman with a family prepared to make repeated trips to Japan to keep the profile of the case high has clearly helped. Given Ichihashi&rsquo;s obvious cunning and the incompetence of the police immediately following the murder, one suspects that if a Japanese woman had been murdered, the suspect would still be at large.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are still some aspects of the case that foreigners may find troubling, like the fact that although Lindsay has been dead for two years and seven months, Ichihashi has not yet (as I write) been charged with murder, but only the much lesser crime of &#8220;abandoning a body.&#8221; That hardly explains the Â¥10 million reward, the posters at every police box, and the plastic surgery; Ichihashi is clearly the culprit. What&rsquo;s more, his actions in avoiding arrest and seeking a new identity reveal a man who has suffered absolutely no remorse at his crime.</p>
<p>Under Japanese law, this makes Ichihashi a prime candidate for capital punishment. All things being equal, following his conviction for murder (of which there can now be little doubt), he will be sentenced to death, spend several years filing appeals, and then, after the justice minister has signed the death sentence, be taken to a place of execution, where a bag will be placed over his surgically altered face and a rope slung around his neck.</p>
<p>But the victory of the DPJ in the recent general elections threatens to complicate matters. The new justice minister is Keiko Chiba, a 61-year-old lawyer and former member of the Japan Socialist Party and an anti-death penalty activist for over 20 years.</p>
<p>While some see Chiba&rsquo;s appointment as the effective end of the death penalty in Japan, this is unlikely. A 2005 opinion poll revealed over 80 percent of the population support capital punishment, and since her appointment, Chiba has been careful not to make any statements about supporting a moratorium on executions. Also telling is that she is planning to quit a lawmakers&rsquo; group opposing capital punishment to focus on her duties as justice minister.</p>
<p>Faced by the usual challenges of government, the DPJ is unlikely to squander its already drooping approval ratings by flying in the face of public opinion. Chiba is more likely to use her powers to prevent the execution of prisoners where the evidence of guilt is less than convincing  &mdash;  a not uncommon phenomenon in Japan  &mdash;  and to try to build general support for the abolition of capital punishment. So in the meantime, she is still likely to sign death warrants, including Ichihashi&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Ironically, one last hope for Hawker&rsquo;s killer lies in the foreign community. The fact that there is no death penalty in the UK (against the wishes of most people, it should be said) and that many expats here oppose capital punishment could prompt the justice minister to treat this case differently than if the victim were Japanese. If that happens, it will be clear evidence of treating the murder of one race differently from that of another, what many people today like to refer to as &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>For this reason, it is vital that the foreign community supports, if not the death penalty itself, then at least the principle of equivalence. Hawker&rsquo;s killer should be dealt with in exactly the same manner as someone convicted of murdering a Japanese woman in identical circumstances.</p>
<p>One reason I believe that Japan still has the death penalty is because human life is regarded as sacred here in a way that it no longer is in the West. While Westerners tend to focus on people who are still living  &mdash;  in cases like this, that means always the killer, never the victim  &mdash;  the Japanese, by contrast, believe in honoring the lives of everyone. This naturally includes the dead, although, given Japan&rsquo;s insularity, it can sometimes exclude foreigners. In this case, the foreign and Japanese communities must come together to honor the life of Lindsay Hawker by prosecuting her killer to the full extent of Japanese law.<br>

						<p>
							<i>London Telegraph, December 2, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Japanese police have charged the man suspected of killing Lindsay Ann Hawker with rape and murder.</p>
<p>Miss Hawker, 22, was found dead in March 2007 on the balcony of an apartment belonging to Tatsuya Ichihashi in Chiba, east of Tokyo.</p>
<p>Police discovered her body in bathtub filled with sand.</p>
<p>She was an English teacher at a private language school and Ichihashi was one of her students.</p>
<p>Police arrested the 30-year-old last month, initially on suspicion of abandonment of a body.</p>
<p>Yesterday they added the charges of murder and rape resulting in death.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, meanwhile, formally indicted Ichihashi for the charge of body abandonment. They have 20 more days to keep Ichihashi in custody before deciding whether to indict him for rape and murder of Hawker, who was strangled.</p>
<p>The suspect had been on the run since police found the body until he was spotted at a ferry terminal in the western city of Osaka on Nov 10.</p>
<p>Ichihashi has refused to co-operate with police and had rejected food for two weeks before starting to eat again last week.</p>
<p>Ichihashi&rsquo;s lawyers have said they believed he has been unable to talk because of fatigue and stress caused by the arrest.</p>
<p>Footage of security cameras at a nearby coffee shop and inside an elevator of the suspect&rsquo;s apartment showed Ichihashi and Hawker together the day before her body was found.</p>
<p>DNA tests on biological samples collected from the victim&rsquo;s body matched those of Ichihashi, Japanese media said on Wednesday, citing police.</p>
<p>Ichihashi has undergone cosmetic surgery several times, forcing investigators to verify his identity through fingerprints.<br>

		<p>The Japanese tourists I deal with here in Las Vegas are usually the easiest people to deal with. They never complain about the prices of anything, they just pay. Which is a stark contrast to my fellow Whites who are constantly looking for a &#8220;deal&#8221; and who brag about being cheap. </p>
<p>So clearly there are some racial differences and I think the death of this girl will be another example of this. The Japanese do not care for Whites as much as their own. I believe that the rapist and killer of this White girl will be set free. The honor thing that Japanese claim to possess is for their own kind, not others.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve stated previously that no one benefits when criminals go unpunished. If this freak is turned loose there is a good possibility that he will kill again. Maybe his next victim will be another white person. Maybe next time it will be a Japanese. But the proper thing to do is to make sure he never gets the chance to do either.</p>

		<p>Jane Seymour did a TV series some time ago now where she toured Japan and explored various aspects of Japanese life. One comment she made was that as a white woman [and an attractive one too] in Japan, in a land of non-white people, she NEVER once had a fear of attack, rape, or being molested in any way. That is the Japanese way within their home islands for the most part. Even more safe there generally by far for a white woman than in a big city anywhere in the U.S.! This particular case is unique and an abberation?</p>

		<p>Huh. This of course brings to mind Issei Sagawa, Japanese cannibal who killed and ate Dutch student RenÃ©e Hartevelt. When Sagawa returned to Japan, not only was he not convicted, he was made a celebrity.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m well aware of this case.  I live in Japan.  Chiba, actually.  There was a highly publicized nationwide manhunt for this guy.  They wanted him bad, and they got him.  They won&rsquo;t be letting him go. </p>
<p>Howard, you are right: the Japanese care more for their own than for whites; or anybody else, for that matter.  What of it?  </p>
<p>This is the proper, natural disposition of healthy people.  It is the reverse which would be perverse.   No one would think very highly of the man who loved another man&rsquo;s wife more than his own.   Likewise, it is natural and good to love one&rsquo;s own children above all others.   </p>
<p>Same goes for caring for one&rsquo;s parents, grandparents, and so on : it is proper, indeed it is duty to care for your own.  To demand or expect  someone else to do so, or be altogether unconcerned about your own kin is a disgusting trait which nature itself will punish in the most absolute terms.  Those who care for their own will prosper, those who don&rsquo;t will go extinct.  </p>
<p>All that is beside the point: this guy is the prime suspect in a terrible crime.  The Japanese have a high regard for the rule of law, and the conviction rate of those arrested and charged here is so high as to raise its own questions  (such as: Are the cops here really so perfect, or do they take too few chances and only arrest open &amp; shut cases, or do the wrongly accused get railroaded? )</p>
<p>Whatever the answers to that part of the issue, the crime problem here is nothing like that of the U.S.A.   I have come to see that as primarily a function of the nature of the population itself, far more than of the judicial system or style of police work.  </p>
<p>It is easy to see right in America.  Crime rates correlate to demographics far more than any differences in the laws or the efforts made to enforce them.  </p>
<p>Rest assured, the Japanese will not let this murderer loose in their own society just because his victim was a foreigner.  After all this effort to catch him, they will most certainly not let him go.  The only question remaining is whether they will let him live.   Only time will tell, but I tend to doubt it.  </p>

<p>Sorry, Howard.  I like a bargain and I&rsquo;m not ashamed of it.  Anyone who &#8220;just pays&#8221; is just stupid.  And stupid I am not! Those Japanese probably aren&rsquo;t stupid either, just embarassed or baffled. And complaining in another language, and another country, is very difficult. They&rsquo;re probably also concerned with &#8220;face&#8221;.  At home, they might be more forceful.</p>

		<p>To the Westerner, Japan appears, on the surface, to be a very pleasant and orderly society.</p>
<p>As far as I can ascertain, on the whole it is - compared to the high levels of violence and disorder in our own societies - a relatively low-crime society, and yet there is an undeniably underbelly.</p>
<p>The authorities have a kind of modus vivendi with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. A couple of years ago there was a spate of vicious assaults and murders directed against homeless people (the welfare system in Japan is extremely limited, and works mainly in the interests of Korean immigrants), which turned out to be the work of teenage schoolboys. When murders do occur there is often an element of sexual perversity, and Western women are disproportionately the victims.</p>
<p>Japan is (like any developed society) a kind of laboratory in which issues of freedom and order are being played out. The police force, although not highly visible, and usually friendly to Westerners, is in fact highly corrupt, and forced confessions under torture are the rule rather than the exception. Executions are conducted in great secrecy. The would-be murderer in Japan must be well aware of what the likely penalty is, and yet a small number of flagrantly nasty killers remains undeterred. Perhaps it is the very orderliness and conformity of most of  Japanese society that prompts the extremity of their transgressions.</p>
<p>Japan would do well to address problems of corruption in its police force, clamp down on organised crime and introduce more transparent procedures in its criminal justice system. The death penalty is a distraction; complete abolition, together with wide-ranging reform (and a sensible relaxation of social codes) would be a useful first step.</p>

		<p>Like the previous post I also deal with Japanese tourists<br>
and find them also a pleasure to deal with<br>
However I think the culprit in this case will be severely dealt<br>
with&hellip;the widespread publicity,lack of remorse and plastic<br>
surgery will ensure he will be dealt with severely as so he should&hellip;a foreign women murdered in bizarre circumstances<br>
and the incompertence of police in allowing him to flee<br>
when trying to initally arrest him ensures that the public<br>
will make sure the judiciary do the job expected of them<br>
 As for foreigners in Japan the liberal types might <br>
play up a bit but at the end of the day his fate <br>
is in the hands of the Japanese law and judiciary and I cant<br>
expect any pardon coming from any politician due to the depth of public anger and shame at the culprit for what he did    </p>

		<p>Slightly off topic, but the liberal/left mainstream media in the UK are always going on about how barbaric the Americans are for having the death penalty, but nothing is ever said about Japan, India, and even China, and no-one I have asked even realised that Japan and India even did executions.<br>
My explanation for the outrage about the Americans and silence otherwise is that the USA is seen as a white country, and white societies are held to a higher standard than non-white countries like Japan. The liberal left don&rsquo;t expect non-white societies to be as ethical as white societies.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;The Japanese tourists I deal with here in Las Vegas are usually the easiest people to deal with.  They never complain about the prices of anything, they just pay.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>haha I can understand that!! in Korea and Japan, everyone is educated and reminded to behave properly when traveling overseas.  One of the rules is to spend honestly while visiting other countries.  On top of that, the Japanese tourists most likely have no clue regarding shopping tricks and tips in Vegas, or anywhere in USA, therefore they just assume and accept that they have no choice but paying the full prices for everything they buy.  I find nothing morally wrong with trying to find the best deals for things we buy&hellip;.  if I ever buy something for a great price, well then I will go right ahead and brag about it as well.  If I visit, say, Netherlands, I doubt I would ever try to find the best deals for things I buy while I am visiting Netherlands, because I simply have basically no clue what it is like to shop in Netherlands and tips and tricks I must keep in mind when shopping in Netherlands.  In Korea, there are websites where you type in the name of an item and the website immediately returns the name of the seller who currently sells the item for the lowest price.  </p>
<p>Regarding the rapist/murderer getting away with the crime&hellip;</p>
<p>if you want my point of view&hellip;.</p>
<p>Sexual assault is never, ever the victim&rsquo;s fault.  The situation might slightly influence how harsh the punishment will be on the criminal, but the sexual assault is never, ever the victim&rsquo;s fault.  If a Korean man commits rape and murder to a visiting White woman, I would have no trouble having the man receiving the appropriate punishment for the crimes.  I will immediately agree that the perpetrator must receive the exact same punishment he would have received if he committed rape and murder to a native Korean woman.  </p>
<p>Lindsay Hawker, her family members and relatives have my deepest sympathy.  </p>

		<p>to 13:</p>
<p>Ironically because her chances of getting a well paid job and a safe place to live, away from dangerous colored people who want to murder her, is much higher in Japan.  She probably wanted to emmigrate to New Zealand but was hassled by their strict immigration policy.</p>
<p>MANY people from the UK flee every year because it&rsquo;s becoming 1) increasingly dangerous from all the immigrants, 2) opportunity is evaporating as almost ALL new jobs, and almost ALL social services are given to immigrants and kept away from brits, and 3) it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly obvious that the UK is becoming a failed fascist state where those elected have no real power to effect anything and the unelected and unaccountable go so far as to oppress the citizenry.</p>
<p>For example.  A group of crazy muslims can stand on the street corner harrassing passers bye and threatening to kill all white people.  Nobody does anything.  But if a white brit complains, he&rsquo;ll be arrested and charged with a hate crime.  A little girl who asks her teacher that she be taught in english&hellip;.arrested and charged with a hate crime.</p>
<p>I could go on&hellip;.but you get the picture.  Large numbers of people are LEAVING in order to protect themselves and their families from that.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that either.  That&rsquo;s never mentioned.  Thank you, Martin.</p>
<p>Let me add  (without meaning offense to our British friends) that  any country which had, up until modern times  something like 260 hanging offenses, one which conducted executions as spectacles for public entertainment,  which burned people at the stake for no crime but their beliefs  (&#8220;thought crimes&#8221;),  and which practiced the horrors of drawing and quartering (not abolished until 1870 but which remained on the statute book until 1947);  a country which still harasses and persecutes people even today for holding unorthodox political opinions, is in no position to lecture others on ANY  matters of enlightened justice!  (In fairness, I might add that forms of execution on the continent were even more horrible.)  Perhaps those sanctimonious Brits (and Europeans) don&rsquo;t know their own history because it&rsquo;s too shameful to face.  If they&rsquo;re looking for gory practices to condemn, there was  plenty at home and no need to look beyond their own shores. They were masters at it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, having  had no foreign races to abuse, their worst atrocities were reserved for each other. Does that make those atrocities more acceptable?  They actually seem to think so. Other whites don&rsquo;t count.  What bizarre reasoning!  </p>
<p> <i>&hellip;&#8221;the outrage about Americans and silence otherwise is that the USA is seen as a white country, and white societies are held to a higher standard than non-white countries&hellip; The liberal left don&rsquo;t expect non-white societies to be so ethical as white societies.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Itself a form of &#8220;racism&#8221;, is it not? These color-blind, anti-racist lefties reveal themselves as the worst of racists&hellip; at least when it comes to their own kind. They are full of solicitude for non-whites, but indifferent to their own. </p>
<p>As another poster said above, the Japanese are fair to all, but most concerned for their own.  Which society is saner?  Which society is sicker?</p>
<p>And lastly, I would ask WHY?</p>

		<p>To &#8220;Traveller&#8221;: You asked me &#8220;what of it&#8221; in regards to the Japanese liking themselves more than Whites. First off I did not say that was a bad thing, but if the Japanese want to claim they are this honorable people with a great tradition than they should show some respect to visitors to their nation. I and other Whites in America show them respect so when one of our own is raped and killed I would expect swift and brutal justice. It seems that the Japanese are taking their time in prosecuting the killer of this White girl.</p>

You needn&rsquo;t worry about me.  I do not like to haggle and I refuse to &#8220;bargain&#8221; (verb).  I never said I did;  but I do like to get &#8220;a bargain&#8221; (noun) when I find one.  Who doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>PS:  Being sensible with money, I never gamble either. So you&rsquo;re not likely to see me near LV. I can think of better things to do with money than throw it away. I can sympathize with the Japanese, who are generally sensible with money too. </p>

		<p>While Japan does have a death penalty (hanging), it is rarely imposed.  I doubt this creep will walk; convictions in Japanb are easy to get, but I also doubt he&rsquo;ll hang.</p>
<p>Nova Group, for whom Hawker worked, went bankrupt a few years ago.  The founder was kept on as CEO after he took the company public, and was embezzling money from Nova and giving it to companies he still owned.  Eventually he bled Nova dry.  Lots of English teachers were left stranded in Japan with no return airfare.</p>

		<p>&#8216;No Mercy!&rsquo; Sounds a bit like the line &#8216;No prisoners!&rsquo; in the Lawrence of Arabia movie - a line that, more or less, Japan seemed to take to heart during WWII. At least, not all that many prisoners of the Japanese survived till the end of the war. </p>

		<p>No offence, ghw, but the so-called &#8220;Bloody Code&#8221; which specified judicial hanging as the penalty for hundreds of crimes in Britain was abandoned in the early 19th century (long before, for example, the United States abandoned the practice of slavery). It had proved unworkable, since juries were unwilling to convict people for trivial crimes that attracted a death sentence. </p>
<p>Public executions were discontinued in the United Kingdom in 1868; in parts of the United States they continued until the 1930s. </p>
<p>As for hanging, drawing and quartering, the Cato Street Conspirators were publicly hanged in 1820, and only after they were dead were their heads severed from their bodies (although the &#8220;drawing&#8221; and &#8220;quartering&#8221; parts of their sentence were omitted). Even this proved too much for the spectators, who were horrified, and the practice was discontinued (even if it enjoyed - like many obsolete penalties - a phantom existence on the Statute Books until 1870).</p>
<p>From at least the 1920s onwards, the days of capital punishment in Britain were numbered. Royal Commissions repeatedly recommended complete abolition, and it was only the recalcitrance of the House of Lords that maintained the practice until the early 1960s. (The 1957 Homicide Act, which severely limited capital punishment, was rightly seen as a precursor to complete abolition.)</p>
<p>I am no bleeding heart, but capital punishment (quite apart from its inherent cruelty and irreversibility) cedes far too much power to an already over-mighty state over the individual. We would do better to concentrate on reducing family breakdown and low-level crime (which have been shown to lead to more serious crime) by supporting the married, monogamous, heterosexual (indigenous!) family through the tax and benefit system, and by ensuring a strong, visible police presence on our streets.</p>

		<p>Thanks for your enlightening comments, Johnny. I got my facts principally from Wikipedia but did not have space to go into detail. My purpose was not to dwell upon dates, but mainly  to point out that some countries still engage in hounding and persecuting dissenters for no &#8220;crime&#8221; other than their opinions or their speech.  Granted, they&rsquo;re not sent to the stake anymore, so that&rsquo;s a slight improvement from the past.</p>
<p>I was feeling very strongly about this, you see, just after having watched some videos of Nick Griffin being abused and ridiculed on BBC television. Quite sickening! The whole system had all ganged up on him,  like some animal that was prepared for sacrifice, and he didn&rsquo;t have a fair chance.  I realize that countries are all guilty of nonobjectivity to some degree, but some are more so than others. An American finds it incredible that perople could be incarcerated for their opinions, writings or speech. We don&rsquo;t do that.  But,it&rsquo;s an ancient practice in Europe. And to say it again, Britain is by no means the sole culprit.  I would hate to think of what Griffin&rsquo;s fate would be in the Third World. I did not mean to sound overly harsh to your country, the land of my ancestors too (from which they escaped).  With kind regards, ghw</p>

<p>I recall that someone once wrote here (perhaps it was Mr.Scott) that there was a crime in Japan for which the entire family of the perpetrator was put to death.  Was that treason? Murder? Rape?  I wish he would refresh my menory on that. I don&rsquo;t doubt the truth of it, but I can find no references to it anywhere.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not completely sure if it is the only crime with that punishment, but the starter of a fire in a city would be subject to that punishment. The reason is because basically all of the buildings were made of flammable materials, meaning that once a fire spread it would do untold property damage.</p>

		<p>Collective punishments of entire families in Japan was abolished when Japan acquired a modern legal system in the 19th Century after the Meiji Restoration, but yes, the crime that carried this punishment was arson.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s traditional style of building with light materials developed for good reasons.  While brick or stone buildings would easily survive the high winds associated with typhoons, they would collapse and crush people during Japan&rsquo;s frequent earthquakes.  It was thought better for the occupants to survive and rebuild.  Unfortunately, these light, easily-replaceable materials were also flammable.</p>
