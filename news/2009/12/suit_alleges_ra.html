<h1><a href="https://centralillinoisproud.com/content/fulltext/?cid=91231&amp;shr=addthis">Suit Alleges Racial Discrimination by 150, Board, Hinton</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WMBD-TV (Peoria), Dec. 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>District 150 is being sued by a group of white teachers alleging racial discrimination. The district as a whole, the school board, former Superintendent Ken Hinton, and several other district employees are named in the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Read the <a href="/media/pdf/Dist150Lawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a>. </p>
<p>The suit says, in part &#8220;[district officials] &hellip;  created, promoted, tolerated and subjected PLAINTIFFS and other white employees to a racially hostile work environment, subjected PLAINTIFFS and other white employees to disparate work conditions because of their race, and discriminated against PLAINTIFFS and other white employees because of their race.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges white teachers were told they didn&rsquo;t have the skill to teach black children because of their race, and that black teachers were hired and assigned based on race instead of qualifications. </p>

		<p>Thomas Sowell said there were a number of blacks in the 50s didn&rsquo;t want to have to go to school with whites either. But they ONLY show it as a bunch of whites  &mdash;  hateful and &#8216;unintelligent&rsquo; ones at that  &mdash;  protesting against racial integration.</p>

		<p>This is not surprising.  The people in the education biz are known to be the most extreme liberals/marxists in any department in any university.  They teach the &#8220;white guilt&#8221; garbage and demand that whites accept it or be drummed out of the department.  So OF COURSE they&rsquo;re going to try and force whites out of the jobs that they are best qualified to have, and then put in inferior black teachers in their place.  This is part and parcel of the education folks&rsquo; agenda in this country.  They want to get rid of all white teachers and teach only revisionist history to all students.  The fact is, most whites have realized that public school is a dangerous place for their kids to be, so they put them in Catholic school or homeschool them.  My 4 brilliant white nephews are being homeschooled, and the 11 yr old has already tested out of high school level in every subject except math.  The other 3 are a minimum of 2 years ahead of their grade levels.  So, white parents, if you want success for your kids in school, homeschool them!!!  It is the only way you&rsquo;re going to keep your kids safe and have them well-educated.</p>

		<p>I agree realist&hellip; the public school system is blatantly engaging in indoctrination at all levels. I personally would not want to be a teacher to black students due to the behavior they usually exhibit. Every class I have been in that included blacks from middle school to professional training classes often had to get back on track due to the loud and obnoxious behavior of the blacks. Even if there were just two or three blacks in the class this was usually the case. </p>

		<p>&#8220;White teachers claim school district told them they didn&rsquo;t have the skills to teach blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obviously true; however, not many teachers can teach anyone that&rsquo;s not capable of learning.</p>

		<p>I believe it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that many white teachers lack the skills and training to teach black inner-city students effectively.  </p>
<p>For example, how many have fluency in so-called black English?  How many have concealed carry permits or the training and expertise to use firearms in the event of a confrontation with your typical knife-wielding nineteen-year-old eighth grader?  How many are trained and practiced in unarmed combat?</p>
<p>Most of these young white educators simply lack the most basic  skills to teach effectively in the &#8216;hood. </p>

		<p>These White teachers have got to be liberals. What sane White person would want to teach at a black school? Hopefully, this has opened their eyes to the joys of &#8220;diversity&#8221;. I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re sueing though. This could be a way for recent college grads in education to pay off their college loan. Get a job at a black school, face the expected racism, then sue them for every penny you can get. Then proceed with your career at a nice White school.</p>

		<p>On National Test, 69 Percent of Detroit Children Score Below Basic on Fourth Grade Math; 77 Percent Below Basic on Eighth Grade Math<br>

<p>Considering Detroit, Blacks aren&rsquo;t doing a very good job of teaching. </p>
<p>The liberals don&rsquo;t want the Black students educated. If they become educated, then they might actually graduate, get jobs and stay off welfare. When they go to vote, they might even support tax cuts over welfare increase and the Democrats sure don&rsquo;t want that.<br>

<p>This sort of &#8220;training&#8221; has nothing to do with &#8220;closing the gap&#8221; but in pointing to &#8220;whiteness&#8221; and &#8220;Western Culture&#8221; as the obstacles to minority students making the grade. </p>
<p>The issue, however, is never the issue. It&rsquo;s not about helping non-White students  &hellip; it&rsquo;s about denigrating and demonizing Whiteness and Western Culture and values.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is code for anything but Western.</p>
<p>Diversity is code for getting rid of White people</p>
<p>Institutionaizedl racism is AOK when the focus is White people.</p>

<p>I am a teacher in an urban school district.  I am by no means a liberal.  About half of the teachers where I currently work are conservative to one degree or another, but we keep our mouths shut and speak only in private to each other because in this urban district, &#8220;multi-culturalism, diversity, social justice&#8221; and all the rest are the principles we are ordered to adopt at the risk of being suddenly deemed &#8220;unsatisfactory&#8221; and getting fired.</p>
<p>I have seen it happen over and over again.  I need my job, no matter how weak my students are in adopting a modern, western curriculum.  As has been noted in other articles here, the idea is that only black teachers can reach black students, but the funny thing is, the students don&rsquo;t do any better, and I have observed this for some time.</p>
<p>They would never turn the argument on its head and say white kids learn better from white teachers.  I wish someone with some national clout would take up that issue and run with it.  I taught in a private school for a number of years, and almost all my kids were Asian.  My race seemed to have no negative effect on them because they passed their state tests as a whole year after year.</p>
<p>Those plaintiffs in this case need to bring up the Detroit Example.  Nearly every teacher, student (and admin) in Detroit is black, but what has been the progress, even after 30 years of black rule?</p>

		<p>Jay - in #9 - referred to the eager and accomplishing pupils whom he taught in a private school as &#8216;Asian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What sort of Asians? Sharp children of Japanese-American dentists or the kids of newly-settled Hmong living on welfare?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a vast difference!</p>
<p>I wonder why Jay changed jobs. Is it still the case that enduring public school hell is a better deal in the long run financially than private school teaching?</p>

		<p>To Southern Hoosier,  I don&rsquo;t know about you but people of sub-saharan african descent are already at a big advantage that has nothig to do with teaching.  Their IQ is less than any other race.  And their tetosterone level is higher than any other race.  Translation.  Stupider and more violent.  Don&rsquo;t expect miracles out of teachers.  </p>

<p>Well, the white teachers perhaps do not have the requisite skill set?</p>
<p>By skill set we can infer the disrespected white teacher trying to keep order in an entire classroom that is full of students who by basic nature are just rowdy, insolent and having a &#8220;behavior deficit&#8221;! </p>
<p>Ask yourself whose fault that is?</p>

		<p>To poster #10:</p>
<p>My students were basically the children of rich Indian doctors.  And yes, enduring the hell of public school is much more financially rewarding.  I usually ponder now, though, how long I can do it, because these urban kids are absolutely nuts.  America is doomed.</p>

		<p>Here in Chiacgo we have another race hustler emerging. A Rev. (of course he&rsquo;s a reverend!)Meeks who is making a crusade for more..Anyone? Anyone? yes,more MONEY for the black public schools. If some of that money should happen to flow his and his friends&rsquo; way,well,whats the problem? One of his big complaints is about the QUALITY of the teachers.He whines that the black kids arent getting the best teachers because the best teachers dont want to get beat up.The black teachers,obviously,are the bottom of the barrel. So if you TRY to teach blacks,you&rsquo;re beat down. If you AVOID teaching blacks,you&rsquo;re beat down. Sorry,all you dedicated anti-racist types,but you will never win with this bunch.</p>

		<p>The first step toward &#8216;Cultural Competence,&rsquo; says the task group, is for future teachers to recognize – and confess – their own bigotry.<br>
Sounds like a rephrasing of Chairman Mao&rsquo;s description of criticism/self-criticism as a &#8220;marxist-leninist weapon.&#8221; <br>

		<p>To the comment about teaching kids of &#8220;rich Indian doctors,&#8221; we have public schools in pockets of Silicon Valley made of 50 percent Indian, 40 percent East Asian, and 10 percent white kids. Most of the teachers are white and the white kids have the lowest test scores among the Indians and East Asians. Yet, I don&rsquo;t see whites whining that the tests are &#8220;biased&#8221; towards Asians. They just learn to be humble and accept the fact that Asians and Indians are better at math than they are.</p>

		<p>While acknowledging that many Asian kids are good at math, I must also point out that I have met more than my fair share of developmentally disabled students from those backgrounds.  In fact, this incidence seems to be much, much higher than the % of &#8216;slow&rsquo; kids among whites.  Many, many of my friends, who come from the Indian subcontinent, have explained this to me as a big problem, especially with cousin marriages carried on through many generations and improper nutrition and care for those who come from very, very poor backgrounds.  </p>

		<p>If Indians and East Asians are better than White kids at math in Silicon Valley, it&rsquo;s because the non-Whites are the drawn from the intellectual elites of their countries.  The Whites in those schools are just the average locals.  The most intelligent Whites will often remove their kids from schools where there are too many Asians, recognizing that the single minded emphasis on math and science that the Asian parents push results in narrow minded people.  Most Asians have no interest in Western literature, music, or art, and healthy Whites aren&rsquo;t willing to see those aspects of their children&rsquo;s schooling neglected.  Blacks and Hispanics want day care, Asians want cramming academies, and intelligent Whites want a real education.  </p>
