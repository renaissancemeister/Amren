<h1>Putting White Communities on the Map</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Sheldon, ourgazetteer.org, December 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I need your assistance in filling in the gaps in my ourgazetteer.oug (https://ourgazetteer.org/) project. Ourgazetteer.org (https://ourgazetteer.org/) was established to enumerate the vast array of implicit European American communities and in particular to find physical space where we can feel safe to voice our own identity. The theoretical framework that supports the site is described in &#8220;Discovering Implicit White Communities, Part 1 (https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/authors/Sheldon-Implicit.html),&#8221; published in The Occidental Observer on November 14, 2009. The application of the theory is described in &#8220;Discovering Implicit White Communities, Part 2 (https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/authors/Sheldon-ImplicitII.html),&#8221; published on November 15, 2009.</p>
<p>So far I have 30 places cataloged (https://ourgazetteer.org/?page_id=3). I don&rsquo;t need money  &mdash;  the site is inexpensive to operate and the labor is all volunteer. What I need is for you to share your experiences. Please take a look at the map (https://ourgazetteer.org/?page_id=3) and help me fill in the places where I don&rsquo;t have any places listed yet. My goal right now is to have one place listed for every state. I have included the states below that do not have an entry yet. If you know of a place that is special to European Americans, send an email to : euamun@gmail.eua (mailto:euamun@gmail.com) or enter your suggestion as a comment here:  https://ourgazetteer.org/?page_id=175. (By the way, if you know of places in states that already have a Gazetteer entry, send those to me, too!</p>
<p> Thank you,</p>
<p>William Sheldon</p>
<p>All I need is this:</p>
<p>Name of place<br>
Location<br>
Website (if you know of  one)<br>

		<p>The downside to this is that it&rsquo;ll give our enemies a list of places to resettle &#8220;war refugees,&#8221; where to send FBI agents in a swarm to search for/provoke civil rights violations, for sundry poverty centers and defamation leagues to sue.</p>

<p>I think you have a point, for they`ll simply follow.  Without the right opportune conditions to establish such a place, we would have to have some enforcement or &#8220;teeth&#8221; if you would to simply have it destroyed-again, and again, and again.</p>

<p>In some ways I agree with your statement on this matter. Although I am sure this data is readily available to any government leftist just by looking at the demographic info already collected by the census, IRS and school test scores.</p>
<p>It does, however, give the average White person a resource to plan future moves or at the least a peaceful vacation.</p>

Of Course some marxist was offended by this and started an investigation/agitation and I believe tried to somehow get people of color there.

		<p>I know a few, in a few places that might surprise you. But there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m giving them to anyone for publication, even if they do have the best of intentions. All that would amount to is a list of places for those who can&rsquo;t maintain decent communities on their own to come out and start destroying.</p>
<p>Almost as bad, are the &#8220;city&#8221; whites (all due respect to the urbanites among us- you know the type I mean) who show up fleeing the mess in the cities, and immediately start turning their new home into the same mess they fled. They never seem to grasp until it&rsquo;s too late that with the malls and shopping strips and Wal-Marts and housing developments, eventually come the Section 8, the shiftless people, the crime, and all the other less than lovely trappings of the urban sprawl.</p>

		<p>Implicit White towns are everywhere where I live, but it sure would be nice if they were a little more explicit, and ethnically aware. They are viscerally patriotic, but flag waving just keeps them more racially ignorant than ever. Most Whites that I interact with daily are essentially race stupid, or pretend to be. Their conscious sense of racial identity is pathetic; no doubt from a lifetime of liberal &#8216;equality&rsquo; brainwashing and social intimidation. By the time they are racially outnumbered and threatened some day - soon, it will of course be too late. They are essentially an unwitting White milk herd, being bilked to finance their own genetic destruction.</p>

I am a Christian and I say to heck with these liberal so <br>
called &#8220;Christians&#8221; who resettle Somalians and similar <br>
others. Many of these liberal &#8220;Christians&#8221; don&rsquo;t even <br>
believe what is written in the Bible. They have turned <br>
Christianity into some kind of &#8220;social-justice&#8221; movement.<br>
</p><br>
<p><br>
I was in Nebraska recently and I stopped at a grocery store<br>
in Holdrege. It is a town of about 5,000 people; very clean<br>
and well kept. While in the grocery checkout line I glanced<br>
over and saw the local paper. Right there on the front page<br>
was a story about soon to be resettled Somalis in Holderege. <br>
It infuriated me to think that these groups are purposely<br>
looking to destroy every last vestige of Whiteness that<br>
they can.<br>

		<p>This is good, of course. but What I really want to see, within my lifetime, is the creation of a third party, in the States, and for Whites to take America back as a whole. </p>
<p>Will White enclaves in a country that is multicultural and rules by a hostile, anti-White elite, provide us with any real security?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t live safely in America, and be free, and prosper, if a reverse racist, Black or Latino president, has his finger on the big red button. Can we?</p>

		<p>I DO know of some places.  But I&rsquo;m not saying where they are, for several reasons.  I don&rsquo;t know anything about the person who wrote this article, what his background is, what his real intent is, or how he&rsquo;s really going to use this information.  No offense, dude, but if you put up a request for sensitive info like this, you need to include some bio and checkable references before you can expect any answers.</p>

<p>Hey, BW- I&rsquo;m a city dweller all my life, but I know I&rsquo;m going to have to make the white flight some day.  (I don&rsquo;t want to live out my retirement/twilight years in this kind of chaos.)  I haven&rsquo;t found that place yet, and by the time I&rsquo;m that age, they may all be gone.  I know the kind of people you&rsquo;re talking about.  I absolutely promise I won&rsquo;t do that.</p>

		<p>I heard of a town like that many years ago&hellip;I believe it was called Mayberry, USA. Of course today such places are scarce. But if you go searching for such a paradise, don&rsquo;t look in New York State. Here in our State Assembly we have the black, hispanic, and asian caucus (in other words all welcome except Whites) but absolutely no one represents or defends White interests.<br>

		<p>The process repeats over and over again. </p>
<p>Phase 1: A small rural community is 100 percent White. Christianity and Conservatism are overwhelmingly predominant. The town is clean, with low crime, conscientious citizens, and good schools. It is not perfect or ideal, but it is as good as it gets in this world.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Liberals and the government notice the relatively pristine town and begin a process of attacks. They resettle hundreds and hundreds of Somali refuges there. They bus in Blacks and Hispanics for school. They encourage every miscreant to move there to enjoy the better life, and they pay for all of these attacks with your tax dollars!</p>
<p>Phase 3: In a very short time, the community is ruined. Destruction of property begins. The new arrivals don&rsquo;t care about maintaining themselves, their property, or their surroundings. They Blacks and Browns cannot keep up with Whites in school so they begin to terrorize them. The Left barges in and demand lower standards so that they can pass too! They insist on community-wide quotas for minorities. Violent crime soars!</p>
<p>Phase 4: The wealthiest and most responsible Whites immediately see what has happened. Their once-pristine community is now ruined. The process of White flight takes hold en force! Property prices plummet. Eventually, more and more Whites do everything in their power to escape. Left behind are the poorest, least-responsible Whites and an exploding population of miscreants and undesirables in &ldquo;need&rdquo; of assistance.</p>
<p>Phase 5: Gradually, Whites congregate in new locations in small numbers. The new, small communities are 100% White. The new places they build are predominantly Christianity and Conservatism. Their new town is clean, with low crime, conscientious citizens, and good schools. It is not perfect or ideal, but it is as good as it gets in this world. The process of building their desirable community takes years of hard work and dedication. </p>
<p>What does it take to ruin it? Not much. All it takes are a few Liberal-minded Whites who sense that it is racist to keep their new town private from Blacks and Browns! Plus, perhaps a few wealthy Whites want impoverished workers from Honduras and Mexico to clean their houses and mow their grass for below minimum wages. Suddenly, the relatively new, clean town is right back into Phase 2 again, never to recover!</p>

		<p>One of the reasons the bleeding hearts resettle blacks such as Somalis in all white areas is because whites, having had no real interaction with blacks, still hold to the liberally indoctrinated idea that race is inconsequential.  In other words, whites have no clue as to what they are really getting into.  The other reasons the do gooders don&rsquo;t just send the Somalis and other black Africans to already black areas is because American blacks HATE them and violence against them is routine.  They often speak better English, and they are often tribal.  Often they have NO identity with the &#8220;victimhood&#8221; by whites that American blacks are always spouting, because Somali are victims of other blacks in their own country.  And, having come from a much more corrupt and much more dangerous society, Somalis are MORE organized as to survival and criminal activity than American blacks.  Hence they are hated and unwelcomed by American blacks.  My view is, we don&rsquo;t NEED or WANT any more immigrants, and certainly NOT third world immigrants EVER.</p>

		<p>It is hard anymore to find a place to live where there is not massive settlement of Somali and other 3rd world refugees. Possibly you can get somewhere and find that you are not terribly welcome since the town has now been discovered as happened to us when we moved to Coeur d&rsquo;Alene Id. There have been so many people who have moved there as refugees from California (mostly White I will add) that locals have gotten tired of it. One guy I worked with had a brick lobbed at his truck before he registered it in ID. I would look at nearby Spokane WA if you really wanted to live in the area. Still majority White but with more job opportunities and higher wages. True you might have to put up with liberal WA state politics but it is still majority White.</p>

		<p>I sometimes also think of this issue.  I also live in the big city, though I was raised in small-town (all white) America - in a world that seems but a wisp of a dream now.</p>
<p>The last time I went home to visit, I saw a gang (they looked like total gangbangers, I might add) of black kids walking down tiny main street and some blacks swimming in the lake I grew up on.  I was mortified.  20 years ago you would have to drive for almost an hour or more before you ever saw any people of color.</p>
<p>Where I live now (in the big city) there are almost no whites.  It&rsquo;s mostly Asian though and upwardly mobile ones at that, so safety is not the issue.  There is, though, no community trust or cohesion around here.  Just a lot of strangers from many countries sharing the same street, but not the same culture or life.</p>
<p>I keep reading statistics that America is still 2/3rds white, but I honestly don&rsquo;t believe that, because anywhere I travel to between the east coast, the south and the midwest, I see just as many non-whites as whites, and in many cases, moreso non-whites.</p>
<p>If ghetto creep makes it past the Iron Rice Bowl that is currently shielding my few blocks, I don&rsquo;t know where to go.  I will not live among ghetto types any more than I would live among white trash.  I feel myself heir to the best in the Western tradition in terms of good manners, civilization, art, literature and philosophy, and I see all around me my civilization falling.  (I am, by the way, neither wealthy nor a snob - I just like the wisdom of our forefathers and their values more than the average person might.)</p>
<p>I get images of Idaho or Wisconson or Maine in my head as a safe refuge, but then I hear how the government is transplanting whole villages of illiterate, violence-wracked Somalis in those places (God only knows why they are even brought here to begin with, for is not the entire population of Somalia in the same bracket of &#8216;eligibility&rsquo; requirements as the economic refugees being brought here now?)</p>
<p>The America we knew is gone forever.  The people being brought in are our replacements.  Mexico City, the streets of Mogadishu, overcrowded Hong Kong - these are what America will be in less than 50 years.  </p>
<p>I agree - do not publish the location of the last white enclaves!  Everything the posters said will happen to them will happen.  I work around social justice types and they are - in a word - relentless in their desire to tear down the civilization that gave them breath to begin with.  Word of mouth is a must.  </p>

		<p>Seems like Mayberry has already turned, Andy Griffith turned into a big liberal&hellip;..Yes the data is already our there.  One needs to only look at each state and the county voting patterns and see it.  For example, Illinois has just over 100 counties and 92 of them voted Republican&hellip;the other 10 or so voted Democrat, but they were Cook, Madison, St. Clair, etc all the big ones where the liberals and minorities live, and the Democrats won. The all white counties all voted republican. If that ain&rsquo;t showing your hand, I dont know what is. The liberals see this and they know what to do.  If you have liberals in your family, disown them. If you neighbor is a liberal disown him. Family, friends, neighbors, whatever. We have got to start now or it will be too late.</p>

<p>In almost every major statewide election of consequence in Illinois since I&rsquo;ve been paying attention, the Republican wins if you subtract Crook County.  Unfortunately, even if you do that, then the Republicans that win won&rsquo;t be much to write home about, because the IL Republicans are just as bad, and Lincolnian.  The running joke is that, for a statewide election, the Democrat nominee is chosen in the basement of a Cement plant near the Union Stockyards in Chicago, while the Republican nominee is picked in a DuPage County country club&rsquo;s golf course locker room.  </p>
<p>The only solution for halfway decent politicians from any part of what is now Illinois is for the southern half to gain statehood, and the statehood movement in Southern Illinois is semi-credible.  Such a state would be 90 percent white, and the whites would either be Kraut (mainly farmlands and farm towns, plus the IL suburbs of St. Louis) or mid-Southerners (far Southern/Little Egypt).  Almost all blacks would be in East St. Louis, Belleville, Carbondale, Murphysboro and Cairo.   Therefore, the politics of the new state would be a cross between Indiana and Kentucky.</p>

Look at the black movement and learn from it they proved they were a people who would not be denied.Are we a people who will not be denied our rights?Will we make a stand no matter the consequences?Jared Taylor has showed us how to use our brains and make statements in a intellegent way.I have resolved in my own mind that I will have to stand alone.I know how that feels and sometimes I am surprised when another white actually joins me in the fight.I have accepted my plight and I know it won&rsquo;t be easy but if it inspires another to stand up fight then maybe it can motivate more.I would rather die than to give up my rights.Did you ever see when a person breaks down on the side of the road with car trouble.All it takes is one person to stop and help and before you know it others join in to help.That is our status now we just need that one person to stop and help us.That one person to make a stand and the rest will stand up with him.God bless us all!</p>

I think that you mean Lewiston Me. The only Littleton of which I&rsquo;m aware is in Colorado. Let me know if I&rsquo;ve made a mistake.<br>
The Somalis apparently are doing a good job of &#8220;Mogadishuizing&#8221; Lewiston. I believe that there was an article here on AMREN that recounted some honor killings there.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered if the &#8220;white enclave&#8221; is our only hope for the future. </p>
<p>However, I fear the white enclave concept will unfortunately need as its predecessor the &#8220;white triage&#8221; period. I&rsquo;m saddened by the number of &#8220;hopeless&#8221; whites I encounter on a daily basis&hellip;otherwise pleasant, enjoyable folks who simply - by choice - remain in that state of disbelief where race is inconsequential. Will there ever come a time when our limited survival efforts and resources must be redirected away from them?</p>
<p>There are of course a few thriving white enclaves left&hellip;however, their key to future success at this point lies in strong, passionate, racially informed leadership. Someone (preferably a mutually supportive group) who is willing to stand up to the government&rsquo;s tree-hugging liberals and make a public &#8220;mess&#8221; of their plans. </p>
<p>Present facts and verified data (i.e. crime stats and historical results of other &#8220;resettlement&#8221; plans) in public forums, write letters to local newspapers, find their voice on local schoolboards, and yes&hellip;organize one another into like-minded groups who show liberal race scouts an unfriendly side. </p>

America as we once new it, as our forefathers fought for, is GONE!  The tide has turned in an insurmountable magnitude.  Yes, we can have small, little White enclaves here and there, but the people who run this country and have messed it up will seek out these White enclaves and do everything they can to destroy them.  Mayberry is GONE or soon will be!  And it is now being replaced w/ refugees from Somalia and illegal aliens from Mexico and China.  Welcome to the new America!  First chance I get, I&rsquo;m out of here!  I hate to sound like a weak man running away, but I am thinking of where I want my children and grand-children to live.  If it is this bad as Whites being the majority now, just think what this place will be like in 50 years!  It will be like Brazil or South Africa!  Get out now, while you can!    </p>

		<p>I am writing from Sheboygan,Wisconsin. Thirty years ago this city was predominately White and Christian. In 1979 the federal government relocated thousands of Hwmong from Laos to Sheboygan. Thirty years later there has been no assimilation. They maintain a seperate culture. We also have thousands of mexican criminals illegaly living here,and again,no assimilation. We also have seen hundreds of blacks moving here from the Milwaukee and Chicago areas. Years ago periodicals like Readers Digest voted Sheboygan as one of the safest and family friendly cities in the U.S. No more. The crime rate just keeps climbing. Murder,rapes.robbery,drugs,sexual assault of children(particularly by the illegal mexicans). What was once a nice safe place to live has become an unsafe haven of diversity.</p>

<p>Some French New Right Ideologists have been pushing the same notion in France.  Basically what they foresee is that France will be littered with segregated cities.

		<p>White communities are where you find insane white people who complain about their &#8220;white privilege&#8221; that makes them guilty of &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;.  These liberal whites live in white communities and haven&rsquo;t yet encountered the Diversity that hates them more than they hate themselves. The only cure for these insane complaining whites is to force them to move out of their white communities and into the diverse, welcoming, tolerant, inclusive, multicultural, afro-hispano-latino-voodoo truly American and integrated communities. Once they get the Diversity Treatment, they will be cured.</p>
<p>The latest patient in need of the cure is Rich Jones of Vero Beach, who complains of his whiteness. Vero Beach is beautiful and 88% white, the kind of place where you find rich, liberal whites who say nice things while sounding progressive, but saying these things without moving into the neighborhoods where Vero Beach&rsquo;s other races congregate and enjoy being with their own kind and culture.</p>

<p>Letter: &#8216;Institutional racism&rsquo; has social, cultural impact<br>
Posted December 19, 2009 </p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>There is a lot of debate about health care, housing, the education system and things like that these days. But why is it that nobody talks about the impact of institutional racism on these social issues?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if they are things that are completely separate from color. Far from it.</p>
<p>As a white person of middle-class standing, I don&rsquo;t have to think about it because of my white privilege. I can pretty easily get good health insurance or a nice house in a good neighborhood if I have the money. If I were black, my skin color would automatically make these things a lot more difficult because of the stereotypical implications of blackness in American society.</p>

		<p>I have a grandson that lives in Coeur d Alene ID and it is getting many Mexicans (illegals?) and some blacks. I have seen many small towns throughout ID that has been taken over by illegals. My grandson went with a half-black half-White girl up there and I found out and called him and told him what I thought about it..It didn&rsquo;t last too long and she caused him nothing but trouble. In fact I was shocked to hear how many bi-racial kids live there. </p>
<p>My grandson&rsquo;s mother is a liberal and didn&rsquo;t see anything wrong with my grandson dating that girl and I imagine most Whites there are just of the same mind set as she is..</p>

		<p>After reading all the comments it is time to make a stand and fight, as one poster said. We can wait no longer. Either divide up the States or have forced deportations by the plane/ship loads. That is our only choice if we are to survive and our children survive.  One more thing we need to do is quit listening to these neo-con talk shows. They won&rsquo;t dare mention race or anything about our displacement. They are too scared. </p>
<p>But of course they can say Redneck, White trailer trash, nazis, White racists etc. at every opportunity, can&rsquo;t they? Has anyone else noticed this?  All Rush, Levin, etc talk about is the left vs right, politics, etc. They talk about all the problems but fail to mention the CAUSE of all our problems. In fact they even want to legalize these illegals and nary a word about the RACE of our current immigration population. It is just fine with them apparently.</p>

<p>Please favor us with any real, personal history of whites (note the plural, as in more than one) that you consider &#8216;trash&rsquo;.

<p>&#8220;The downside to this is that it&rsquo;ll give our enemies a list of places to resettle &ldquo;war refugees,&rdquo; where to send FBI agents in a swarm to search for/provoke civil rights violations, for sundry poverty centers and defamation leagues to sue.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with this.  A double edged sword.  I say the same thing about Oath Keepers.  Although I like the idea, it also provides a list that tells the government, should they get hold of it,  who has guns, and is anti-government.

		<p>Almost as bad, are the &ldquo;city&rdquo; whites (all due respect to the urbanites among us- you know the type I mean)</p>
<p>This is true but it is also true that most people in small rural White majority towns tend to be liberal and think race is inconsequential. My husband and I tend to think that this is due to the lack of conservative radio stations and talk shows to reach far into the hinterland. Being a truck driving family, we often found that all we could reach radio wise was NPR (before we got satellite radio which is expensive) NPR is notoriously liberal and if this is the only outlet other than network television (same story) These poor people are set up for a takeover by refugees and they will welcome their doom with open arms. </p>
<p>As far as areas that were formerly majority White going gradually blacker and browner I noticed this last summer when I visited my hometown in South Louisiana for the first time in almost 20 years. The small towns in East Texas that were bastions of White Southern (with a small black minority) were gradually becoming more and more Hispanic. The city beach was now 90% black with the Whites going to the smaller South town beach. When I was a child (and when I went back there to college) the blacks rarely went to the beach and if they did they generally stayed to one side. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Oops&hellip;&#8221; (#35), I&rsquo;ll define &#8220;White Trash&#8221; for you.  Knowing what WT is is important, because the hatred for their own race exhibited by our &#8220;elites&#8221; frequently has its basis in early contact with White Trash.  Maybe it was an abusive nanny.  Maybe it was bullies at school.  Maybe it was the Gym teacher&hellip;</p>
<p>White Trash is low-IQ.  Generally, this is because they come from stupid stock, AND because of malnutrition and early exposure to harmful substances: a Nature + Nurture double-whammy.  Someone coming from a long line of &#8216;rabble&rsquo;, whose mother smoked and drank while pregnant, and whose early diet consisted of low-nutrient/sugar-laden foods, has little chance of being very bright.  </p>
<p>White Trash is dysfunctional.  They have what our Fundamentalist maid calls &#8220;poverty of spirit&#8221;.  Their worldview does not include the things (ambition, long-term planning, thrift, restraint, temperance, application, rationality&hellip;.) that move persons and families ahead in the world.  To know them is a draining experience, because they will devalue YOUR values.</p>
<p>White Trash is dangerous to be around.  They&rsquo;re the kind of people who say things like &#8220;Hey!  I never did drugs!  I only smoke weed.&#8221;  That would be bad enough, but then you learn that they also have been alcoholics since Puberty, and &#8220;Sell a little Meth on the side.&#8221;  They all smoke.  And they drive as one would expect cigarette-smoking alcoholic potheads on Meth to drive.  They&rsquo;re the people who cut down the shrubbery around their houses, and who will molest your kids, if your kids are allowed to play with theirs.  Then, there&rsquo;s the domestic violence angle, which I don&rsquo;t need to describe.</p>
<p>WHITE TRASH MAY NOT REALLY BE ALL THAT WHITE.  Just because someone is blond and blue-eyed does not mean their bloodlines are pure.  Admixture of other races can bring subtle things, like lack of foresight, lack of empathy, and inefficient brain metabolism (this last is a biggie&hellip;indigenous North Europeans have extremely efficient brain metabolism.  Remember the German in Tallulah Bankhead&rsquo;s &#8216;Lifeboat&rsquo;?  Even with Hypoglycemia, starving and under intense stress, they tend to think clearly.  I SO wish I possessed this trait.).</p>
<p>White Trash, as opposed to &#8216;Rednecks&rsquo;, likely voted for Obama.  White Trash girls are the ones you see, exposed bellies hanging over jeans, talking Ebonics with their black baby-daddies. They lack the faculty of critical thought, and so are receptive to Media brainwashing.</p>
<p>&#8216;White Trash&rsquo; is not a synonym for &#8216;Redneck&rsquo;.  A Redneck is simply an unrefined person of Celtic descent.  I know Rednecks who graduated Cum Laude from Harvard.  Since the Jews and Scots moved away, virtually all of Mississippi&rsquo;s Upper Crust is now Redneck.  Rednecks, today, tend to be smart, affluent, and good-looking (maybe because they&rsquo;re pure-white).  You can not say the same of White Trash.  </p>

<p><i>This is true but it is also true that most people in small rural White majority towns tend to be liberal and think race is inconsequential.</i></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to all of the &#8220;hinterlands,&#8221; but what I&rsquo;ve seen personally doesn&rsquo;t necessarily bear this out. In the nearly all white towns in Maryland where I grew up, race was not so much thought of as inconsequential as much as just not thought of at all. Why would it have been? There was hardly any non-white presence to think of. </p>
<p>The attitude you speak of did eventually develop, but it was when urban and suburban whites from the Balto/DC corridor started invading. They brought that attitude with them, and quickly sought to impose it on the rest of us, along with all the other trappings of sprawl I mentioned. And of course they were oblivious to how much like their old home their new one was becoming. </p>

		<p>Thank you poster #40 for the response to post #35.  #35 took offense at the term white trash and inferred that I do not know anything about it.  Both my parents are high school dropouts.  They had me when they were 16 years old.  While they&rsquo;re good people in general, they made a lot of mistakes, like many of their peers.  </p>
<p>ALL of my aunts and uncles have been divorced and remarried, multiple times.  They drink far too much and have few goals in life beyond their paycheck and the bar.  ALL of my many cousins but two have been into sex, drugs and rock n&rsquo; roll for as long as I can remember.  My great grandparents, great aunts and great uncles were moonshiners in Kentucky or coal miners in PA with a penchant for trouble.</p>
<p>My family tree goes back to Jamestown and Plymouth Bay Colony and further back in the British Isles, Scandanavia, Germany and France, and some generations were better than others, but the relatives I have who came of age in the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s are all - in a word-  quite trashy, thank you very much.  </p>
<p>What about me?  My father didn&rsquo;t want me to make the same mistakes that he did, so he kept me at home all the time and filled my life with chores.  I discovered books in the interim to escape my drudge-filled life.  My grandma took me and my sister to church religiously during our formative years.  I was able to escape the fate of the white trash all around me and set my sights on a better class of whites - heirs to the best in our civilization.</p>
<p>After multiple college degrees and a very nice career in academia, I can say that I prefer to live around better moral stock than either ghetto trash or white trash.  So I CAN speak about white trash, having extricated myself from that world.  </p>
<p>I just hope others of my bretheren can also make the transition, because in the new multicultural America, underclass whites have little hope of any path to betterment, and that is something that all the posters here seem to agree on.</p>

<p>The only white enclaves left in either place worth living in (I don&rsquo;t like thuggy white &#8216;hoods) are insanely expensive, so my advice is:</p>
<p>Work very hard and be very successful, then live in a white or virtually 100% white enclave north or west of Boston, there are some incredibly beautiful towns up there, many exquisite museum towns teeming with colonial heritage &amp; set on the Atlantic or in pristine country, many on the train line to Boston or Cambridge.</p>
<p>When I visit my family, it is like another planet: even the teenagers have no &#8216;tude, are polite &amp; sweet &amp; speak in complete sentences &amp; pull their pants all the way up!!</p>

		<p>Lauren @ 40: thanks for responding on &#8216;Jay&rsquo;s&rsquo; behalf. I didn&rsquo;t respond to you because I wanted to hear from <i>him</i>.   &mdash;  And eventually we did hear from him, of course.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  and Jay @ 44; thanks for the response as well. </p>
<p>From both of you, I gather there&rsquo;s a lot of personal experience, and I appreciate the very important definition of the &#8216;white trash&rsquo; term. I&rsquo;m familiar with it from public school history classes and occasional reading thru my adult life [I could charitably be described as &#8220;middle-aged and then some&#8221;].</p>
<p>But what I think I can still point out is the enormous difference between your perception of &#8216;white trash&rsquo; based on your [apparently] unfortunate life experiences with some whites, family or otherwise, and the large-scale reality of US society. Tell me if I missed something, but is there really a &#8216;white trash&rsquo; neighborhood that all of us, uh, decent people can avoid? Are &#8220;white trash&#8221;-types moving into your and my neighborhoods, perhaps with Section 8 vouchers, and dragging down property values? Are &#8220;white trash&#8221; kids ruining your and my neighborhood schools [as in your own kids&rsquo; education and quality of life] with sociopathic behavior that we&rsquo;re forbidden to notice, or speak of? In fact, is there any likely way you could even find a &#8220;white trash community&#8221; to live in, &#8220;Jay&#8221;?</p>
<p>  &mdash;  I doubt it. </p>
<p>On the list of things that make our lives more dangerous, more crass, and simply more &#8220;tacky&#8221;, I say the concept of &#8220;white trash&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t even register.</p>
