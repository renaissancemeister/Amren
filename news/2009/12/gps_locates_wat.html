<h1><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/scavenger/detail?entry_id=54273&amp;tsp=1">GPS Locates Water, Offers Poetry for Illegal Immigrants Crossing Desert</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aileen Yoo, San Francisco Chronicle, December 29 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} The Transborder Immigrant Tool was developed by UC San Diego prof and activist Ricardo Dominguez and UCSD lecturer Brett Stalbaum. Both believe it will save the lives of hundreds of people who die each year during their trek across &#8220;Devil&rsquo;s Highway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the tool works. The phone, loaded with free GPS software, displays a digital compass that locates water stations installed by John Hunter, founder of the Water Stations project. Stations that are too far will not be displayed. The phone pinpoints &#8220;safety sites&#8221;  &mdash;  such as Border Patrol station, a clinic or a church  &mdash;  and includes poetry written by Amy Carroll to &#8220;welcome you to the U.S,&#8221; said Dominguez. Encrypted to avoid detection by authorities, phones are $30 and should be available by summer.</p>

		<p>Another good thing is that the GPS could tell you where the border is, so that you know to stop and go back.</p>
<p>Notice that a BP station is called a &#8220;safety site.&#8221;  That should tell you a lot about the BP.</p>

		<p>How typical: a collaboration between academia, fifth-columnists,<br>
and high tech   &mdash;   with the usual aims: erase borders, sabotage<br>
the nation-state (but only of a White-founded country, naturally), undermine homeland security, and commit treason.<br>
(The only &#8216;usual suspect&rsquo; category missing in this particular story is a perfidious representative of some government entity).<br>
In the USA of the not-so-remote past, such a project (or its equivalent in terms of the technologies available in earlier eras) would no doubt be punished severely by our government (at all levels) and courts.  </p>

		<p>I think an eye opening experience would be to post hidden cameras at these &#8220;water stations&#8221; and observe the behavior of those using them.</p>
<p>More than any argument, that would change the minds of a great many people who think this is a good or humane thing to do.</p>

		<p>I have visited Wal-Mart and Target stores in locations with 100 percent White employees and patrons. The stores were very clean and well-organized. The shopping carts and parking lots were in good repair. The store associates and my fellow shoppers were friendly and courteous. The restrooms were clean and sanitary. I felt safe in the stores. Incidentally, some of the stores were 20 years old, but they still looked immaculate, as though the people cared about their surroundings and collectively worked to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Conversely, I have visited several brand new and relatively new Wal-Mart and Target stores across south Texas in areas with very high Hispanic and Black concentrations. Few Whites were around. The restrooms were unimaginably filthy with sewage in the floors and broken urinals on the walls. Although the stores were much newer, they were already filthy, run-down, disorganized, chaotic, and dilapidated. The shopping carts were all busted up and mangled. The parking lot was filthy with broken beer and wine bottles littering the lot. The shoppers inside were like ignorant animals milling around. With many, it was nearly impossible to tell what race they were. None looked inspired or engaged. The disinterested associates either could not speak English or simply didn&rsquo;t give care about assisting shoppers. Announcements in broken Spanish, Spanglish, and Ebonics blared over the broken intercom systems. The air conditioning did not work and various forms of insects were crawling or flying around inside in large numbers. The places were disgusting and frightening hellholes. One would never guess he was in the United States.</p>
<p>My friends, this is not a story about Wal-Mart and Target. This is story about two microcosms of America, as well as the world around us. </p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that White people have a long history of inventing, building, maintaining, developing, learning, growing, enriching, and nurturing. Undesirables simply share none of our traits. They are simply unable to engage in behavior that yields the rewards of responsible actions, such as earning a desirable outcome. That&rsquo;s why their countries are unimaginably horrible and wretched. </p>
<p>What do you suppose will happen when the inhabitants of those despicable places come to our country? The fact of the matter is that it they already have and the results are unimaginably bad! </p>
<p>You see, they won&rsquo;t fix the problems in their countries, so they&rsquo;ve come to take advantage of what Whites have created! In the process, the undesirables ruin and destroy as they always do. The results are *always* the same with *no* exceptions. If anyone ever finds an exception   &mdash;   any exception!   &mdash;   please point it out to me and I will admit that I am wrong.<br>
 <br>
As for Blacks, simply look at what happens to their community when Wal-Mart closes and cable television are closed down in a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina! They devolve immediately to their basic state where brutal behavior and anarchy rules! What did that teach us? It taught us that White society serves to largely masking the true nature of Blacks.</p>
<p><br>
My friends, you and I work hard for what we have. We naturally recognize that it takes personal sacrifice and great effort to achieve desirable outcomes. We do not take the easy road. Undesirables know of no other road, therefore they want to climb in our cart while we pull them up the hill!</p>
<p>Whites have carried the dead weight of Blacks for nearly 150 years. Now, our government insists that we must carry the dead weight of Hispanics and Muslims up the hill as well!</p>
<p>Wake up, my friends!</p>

		<p> &#8220;Encrypted to avoid detection by authorities&#8221;</p>
<p>Aiding and abetting a person illegally crossing the border is a crime in itself. Encrypting communications is indicative a criminal enterprise and probably illegal just of itself under some FCC regulation or law. Encryption is used by SPIES or TERRORISTS under usual circumstances and almost constitutes an act of insurrection or waging war just in itself.</p>
<p>These persons doing this &#8220;aiding and abetting&#8221; are doubly guilty and should be duly prosecuted and sent to PRISON.</p>

		<p>So, this proudly advertised aiding and abetting of FEDERAL CRIMINALS, and contributing to the most henious breech of NATIONAL SECURITY (in an age of misguided and much abused machinations to clamp down on the people in the name of HOMELAND SECURITY), will go UNPUNISHED.<br>
Bank on it. Neary a peep from  the Border Patrol,DOJ,FBI,CIA, The Prince, (B. Hussein Obama), ICE, and all the &#8220;Czars.&#8221; Nada. No one cares.</p>
<p>A nation that ignores such basic principles of law and order is no nation at all&hellip;this is anarchy. Anarchy with McDonald&rsquo;s and Wal Mart, but anarchy none the less.<br>
Considering that one of these &#8220;Mexicans&#8221; could be A Muslim terrorist carrying a nuke to pop on a US city, it&rsquo;s unconscionable. Still, no one cares. If a mushroom cloud envelops Los Angeles, the above tyranical agencies and our  president will only decry extremism, and bring the iron boot down on everybody. No one will decry the open back door.<br>
 <br>
 In the final analysis, we see Liberals, seeking to exalt themselves to some perverted sainthood, bringing suffering and death to millions&hellip;But, hey, isn&rsquo;t that what Liberals are born to do? Um,Yes,it is.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to this story than what the Bolsheviks at the SFC reported.</p>
<p>My local paper (shockingly) reported the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The effort is being done on the government&rsquo;s dime - an irony not lost on the designers whose salaries are paid by the state of California.</p>
<p>&#8216;There are many, many areas in which every American would say I don&rsquo;t like the way my tax dollars are being spent. Our answer to that is an in-your-face, so what?&rsquo; says UCSD lecturer Brett Stalbaum, 33&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Did you catch the part about the &#8216;effort being done&rsquo; on the government&rsquo;s dime and the lecturer&rsquo;s arrogant &#8216;so-what&rsquo; attitude?  Are you furious yet?</p>
<p>California is imploding economically from trying to sustain a massive parasitic welfare class and at the same time driving job-creating businesses out of the state with confiscatory taxes and onerous regulations.  It&rsquo;s seditious idiots like stalbaum that are hastening California&rsquo;s demise  &mdash;  who on earth does he think is going to pay for these parasites when businesses and productive taxpayers are gone? </p>
<p>The very last thing California needs, with unemployment at a 40-year high of 12.5% (according to the government, more likely it&rsquo;s 20% or higher), is more uneducated, unskilled, r-factor welfare parasites.</p>

<p>I have read reports here in S. California that the water stations are vandalized as soon as they&rsquo;re put up:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Humane Borders is claiming that their water stations and the flags they fly on 30-foot poles are being vandalized, emptied and shot full of bullet holes&hellip;vandals have been coming out to the water stations, pulling the caps off the tanks and dump the water out into the desert&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>These illegal colonists take their chances crossing a vast, barren, waterless wasteland in 110 degree heat.</p>
<p>It is their own fault if they don&rsquo;t make it to the promised land of Free White Money.</p>

		<p>Peejay:  If anyone destroys the water feeders it would likely be considered criminal mischief.  And, since these stations are placed for the benefit of the saintly, godly, and always superior Mexican illegal immigrants, hate crime charges would be thrown in as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an upside down world.  There is a law against aiding and abetting illegal entry into the country.  When was this law ever enforced in the last few years? </p>
<p>Notice that these do-gooders are established in a university where they are living off the tax dole.  If they had to compete in the labour market with illegals at China-Mart wages, they might learn something other than what their self-hating communist profs tells them.</p>
<p>Adding another insult, FOX reported that the funds for development of this device came from the stimulus package. Just great!!!  </p>
<p>Of course the Border Patrol could stake out these water holes, but they won&rsquo;t.  The sector chiefs are too weak and politically corrected to do their jobs. Although the individual agents still try. </p>
<p>Since the worthless Customs service took over nearly all of immigration enforcement they have spread their incompetence far and wide. This infection ranges from the senior executive politically appointed hacks to the lowest GS grade. </p>
<p>As an aside, I often wonder how many sector chiefs are actually in-bed with the Mexican invasion. After all, since many sector chiefs are Mexican themselves, how eager are they to zealously stop illegal immigration?     <br>

<p>So I can&rsquo;t comment on it, not knowing what it is.</p>

		<p>17 voter: I believe that GPS stands for Global Positioning Satellite.  There are a bunch of satellites, enough that from any spot on Earth a GPS receiver can pick up the signal from at least three of them.  From those three signals, you can be determine within 30 feet (I&rsquo;m told) where you are.  I&rsquo;ve never used one myself, since I can read a map, but I&rsquo;ve ridden in a car with a computer dependeat driver.  Really annoying.<br>
