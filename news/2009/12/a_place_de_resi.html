<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Doggedly determined to succeed, Mounia Oulias makes a near-daily trek to a strip-mall immigrant settlement agency to use its aging computers to try to find a job.</p>
<p>For three months, the secretary by training from Morocco has been doing the same thing.</p>
<p>She hasn&rsquo;t even had one reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I didn&rsquo;t think they would roll out the red carpet for me,&#8221; Oulias says with a shy smile. &#8220;But I didn&rsquo;t think it would be this difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Oulias is beginning to discover, among the provinces that receive the most immigrants  &mdash;  Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec  &mdash;  she has chosen the most challenging one in which to try to integrate.</p>
<p>A Star analysis of Quebec&rsquo;s performance in a number of key areas, globally viewed as indicators of integration, suggests this province faces daunting gaps between its intentions and the reality newcomers experience in finding their place in the workforce and life in general.</p>
<p>What critics describe as a &#8220;systemic resistance to diversity&#8221; persists despite the fact that Quebec is facing serious labour shortages and there are more government programs than ever before to address the problems.</p>
<p>Among the indicators that show the province is falling short:</p>
<p>* Economic: Recent immigrants here face higher unemployment rates than Ontario or B.C., especially those from francophone countries in North Africa.</p>
<p>* Political: Representation of visible minorities in major institutions such as the police, civil service, school boards and trade unions is far below population figures.</p>
<p>* Cultural: The populace exhibits greater wariness toward new immigrants and their customs.</p>
<p>Last year, the province examined the so-called &#8220;reasonable accommodation&#8221; of minorities, especially religious ones, after controversies in 2007 raised alarm that Quebecers&rsquo; values were threatened.</p>
<p>While experts point to signs of integration  &mdash;  Montreal is less ethnically segregated at the neighbourhood level than other Canadian cities  &mdash;  Quebec businesses are still reluctant to hire foreigners, and even laws meant to provide equal access aren&rsquo;t making much difference.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s so sad: is everyone asleep?&#8221; Ana Campagna pleads. &#8220;Do we not realize the entire economic development of Quebec is tied to immigration?&#8221;</p>
<p>Campagna, executive director of Centre Génération Emploi, a job and integration agency, says if there isn&rsquo;t movement on all dimensions of integration &#8220;then you&rsquo;re setting up a marginalization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fo Niemi, executive director of Montreal&rsquo;s Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations, points to a &#8220;systemic resistance to diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigration is rapidly increasing in Quebec. The province will accept about 55,000 newcomers in 2010. Just two years ago, it was around 45,000. Meanwhile, its face is changing. While 30 per cent are now considered &#8220;ethnocultural&#8221; minorities (non-French Canadian), 8.8 per cent are visible minorities (non-white). That proportion jumps to 26 per cent in Montreal.</p>
<p>Native Quebecers&rsquo; relationship to new immigrants is more complicated than elsewhere in Canada.</p>
<p>Scholars note immigration is concentrated in Montreal so most Quebecers have little experience with it, the francophone majority is quite homogenous, and there is an eternal fear that its identity and language are vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the majority is always more worried than the majority in Toronto or Vancouver,&#8221; says sociologist Annick Germain, director of the Metropolis Centre, which studies immigration.</p>
<p>Quebecers in positions of power are nevertheless apt to defend the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada has analyzed labour force data and found Quebec fares worse than Ontario or B.C. on immigrant unemployment.</p>
<p>The immigration and cultural communities minister cautions against comparing Quebec to these provinces. &#8220;Our model of integration is completely different,&#8221; Yolande James tells the Star. The fact that in the longer term the jobless picture brightens, she adds, &#8220;shows very clearly there is a process in place that&rsquo;s completely normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The assumption that language is the biggest barrier to immigrants finding jobs also appears untrue, since the jobless rate for French-speaking allophones, such as those from the Maghreb, hovers above 20 per cent. James, conceding it&rsquo;s &#8220;something that worries us enormously,&#8221; maintains that &#8220;learning the language is key to integrating in Quebec, but it&rsquo;s not the only thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be sure, Quebec immigrants face similar challenges to those in other provinces. The struggle to have qualifications recognized is one example. Ahmed, 51, a newcomer from Algeria, is an accountant who has spent five months looking for a job. He&rsquo;s given up trying to enter the professional order of accountants since he&rsquo;d have to &#8220;redo all my studies.&#8221; But finding a job even somewhat related is proving difficult, he says, because he lacks Quebec experience.</p>
<p>There are signs, however, that immigrants face higher hurdles here in terms of getting a foot in the door. The Star has found the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, has no visible minority in its management. Neither do the major trade unions, such as the Confédération des syndicats nationaux and the La Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec.</p>
<p>Michel Leblanc, president of the board of trade, which has 7,000 individual and 3,000 company members, says the organization is not meant to be a &#8220;statistical representation of the map&#8221; but rather a place for business leaders.</p>
<p>As ethnic groups establish themselves, business success will follow, he says. &#8220;We&rsquo;re trying to track them and promote them,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s just a matter of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The board has implemented, with James&rsquo;s ministry, what many are calling a successful program, &#8220;World on our Doorstep,&#8221; matching immigrants with companies for internships that last a few days.</p>
<p>In other institutions such as the Montreal police, and especially Quebec&rsquo;s provincial force, the Sûreté du Québec, visible minorities are severely under-represented.</p>
<p>The Quebec Human Rights Commission released a report in April following up on a 2001 law designed to promote equal access in public institutions to groups historically discriminated against. Eight years on, &#8220;visible minorities are poorly represented in all public bodies,&#8221; the report said. It also noted general &#8220;resistance&#8221; to meaningful measures to address the problem.</p>
<p>The commission criticized the Sûreté du Québec for a &#8220;near absence of visible minorities among the police personnel.&#8221; The level was just 0.4 per cent. Minorities are also markedly under-represented in the civil service.</p>
<p>Marie-Thérèse Chicha, an economist at the University of Montreal, has studied employment equity in Quebec, and found most firms that took action on diversity had headquarters in Toronto or the U.S. &#8220;I&rsquo;d say there is a lot of prejudice,&#8221; she says. &#8220;People want to work with people they resemble, and hire those with the same profile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack Jedwab, executive director of the Association for Canadian Studies, said French Canadians&rsquo; history means they have a built-in network, a &#8220;solidarity,&#8221; he calls it, that can be tough for others to penetrate.</p>
<p>Quebec&rsquo;s Intercultural Relations Council surveyed businesses and this summer reported that though many said they were open to diverse hiring, &#8220;the number of practices that would make that possible was kind of disconnected,&#8221; said its president, Patricia Rimok.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Toronto it was the business sector that took the lead, in Quebec it&rsquo;s the government,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>As it happens, other English entities do better than their French counterparts in terms of diversity.</p>
<p>The level of representation of visible minorities in English school boards, according to the Human Rights Commission, is 4.3 per cent, compared to just 1.7 per cent in French school boards.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t like these comparisons because it&rsquo;s not the language you speak that will determine your capacity to be open&#8221; to immigrants, says James, Quebec&rsquo;s first black cabinet minister.</p>
<p>Businesses, school boards, and Quebecers in general are &#8220;very welcoming and open. If you ask me, &#8216;Does discrimination exist?&rsquo; the answer is yes, as it does elsewhere. It&rsquo;s our responsibility to be vigilant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The complex relationship Quebecers have with newcomers also means they are more demanding of immigrants than other Canadians to drop their customs for those of the majority, polls consistently show. The province has instituted a controversial new policy forcing immigrants to sign a declaration accepting Quebec&rsquo;s &#8220;common values,&#8221; which state, for example, that speaking French is a necessity, and that men and women are equal.</p>
<p>Quebec&rsquo;s Liberal government has launched more programs aimed at integration than any previous one. It recently ran an ad campaign that stated Quebec&rsquo;s future couldn&rsquo;t be written without immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t say diversity is good because it&rsquo;s politically correct to say it,&#8221; James declares. &#8220;It&rsquo;s because we really believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>An immigrant like Mounia Oulias can only hope that attitude trickles down to whomever eventually decides to hire her.</p>

		<p>Quebecers, as a linguistic minority in North America, are much more aware of the need to protect their language and culture than is the case for English-Canadians and Americans. Hence they are much more resistant to multiculturalism than other white people in the New World. When I took a french immersion course in Quebec when I was 18, all of us students were told point blank to speak nothing but French, and if they caught us speaking English, we were sent back home pronto! And we had to attend all the excursions to sites of Quebecois culture and prominence, and this was not an option. &#8220;You&rsquo;re here to immerse yourself in our culture and our language, and if you don&rsquo;t like it, then get lost!&#8221; was the message we received. At the time, I thought it was a bit harsh, but looking back, in hindsight, other white people need to learn to send out that message too!<br>

		<p> I hope Quebec decides to secede if forced into p.c. standards. The people of France will have a familiar place to go in the Moslem Future. Also, separation will be an impetus here in the States. I hope.</p>

		<p>With all due respect to the WASPs, I suspect that it will be so-called &#8220;ethnic&#8221; whites (as if WASPs don&rsquo;t have an ethnicity&hellip; but that&rsquo;s a different discussion), who are positioned to do best, or, least badly.  </p>
<p>Language, religion, religous-based schooling, and tight family ties promise to shield them from some of the corrosive effects of the prevailing culture. </p>
<p>English-speaking protestant whites have no such protection. </p>

		<p>From a tourist point of view&hellip; I like the French flavor of Quebec&hellip; And indeed there are some beautiful French girls in Quebec City along with cool old buildings. I&rsquo;m sure there are some uglier aspects to the French provincialism&hellip; I was in Montreal once in about 82 and did see a riotous large group of young dirt bags chanting and mocking passerby&rsquo;s, kicking cars, attempting to tip buses,&hellip; harrasing old people etc&hellip; Entirely despicable cowardly behavior..I only recently learned this was part of the seperatist movement (as before I was clueless given the language barrier). When the cops finally came after a long period of unchecked stupidity&hellip; the former wolves quickly inverted to bleeting sheep* Anyway from my percpective I like the Frenchness of Quebec and the flare it offers,.. It comes as no surprize that they also like themselves and have the healthy desire to avoid the extinction of their culture by avoiding the folly of foreigners bearing gifts* The tolerance and celebration of diversity can only be accomplished if its allowed to exist*</p>

		<p>Once and for all, understand that Canada has no labour shortages. Anything taught in colleges relating to business, accounting, engineering, computers, science or math is oversupplied in Canada. We all know people in these fields who are unemployed. Canada has high unemployment numbers.</p>
<p>There is no way the Star newspaper doesn&rsquo;t know this. For them to produce such nonsense news articles must be due to a flaw in their liberalism. They have nothing left to hold onto with traditional liberal passions. They don&rsquo;t know if they are socialist or capitalist, religious or atheist, environmentalist or pro-development, individualist or communalist. Everything seems up for grabs. Everything is open to debate. What&rsquo;s to get excited about if everything has to be argued? So they hold onto something they think is going to last - diversity.  They are now fanatics about diversity. It&rsquo;s always about increasing diversity, beating down critics of it, pushing back resistance to it.</p>

All they have to do is enact a few affirmative action programs to discriminate against the native population and everything should be fine for Mounia and every other immigrant.</p>

		<p> With their hate-speech laws, &#8216;human-rights&rsquo; commisions and endless blather about how to &#8216;accomidate&rsquo; minorities, english Canada is further down the road to becoming a semi-totalitarian, third-world style marxist state than even the US. But francophone Quebec has apparently been left behind to a large extent when it comes to embracing the cult of multiculturalism.  The quebecois would do us all a favor if they stood their ground, and if needed, break away from the rest of Canada if they can&rsquo;t run thier province the way they see fit. If Quebec did break-away it would be a positive development, for it would show that the political geography of this part of the world can change, and it could inspire similar independence movements elsewhere on the continent. Certainly parts of the US would feel empowered to consider the possibility of independance as a viable option,especially over the federal government&rsquo;s policy of flooding vast areas of counrty with third-worlder immigrants w/o the consent of the people who already occupy those given areas. Just think of how much better things would be in California if it was a soverign nation able to control the flow of immigration into its territory w/o the interferance of a indifferent federal gov&rsquo;t 3,000 miles away.</p>

		<p>Thirty years ago, Quebec famously imported the most wretched migrants from the slums of Haiti, because Haitians spoke French, and the Catholic influence to extend charity to the poorest of the poor was inculcated into the souls of Quebecers.</p>
<p>A few years later in Quebec City, a scandal broke.  The fine immigrant Haitians were running a street gang called the &#8216;Wolf Pack&rsquo;.  They gained notoriety for pimping underaged white Quebecois girls. Since then the term &#8216;Bronxification&rsquo; has been coined to describe the colored take-over of urban neighborhoods. </p>
<p>Politically liberal Quebecers live in the cities, and they&rsquo;ve held sway over the politics in Quebec by demonizing English Canada.  Only recently has the conservative rural Quebecois found its backbone.  They have more common ground with Conservative white English Canada than with cultural Marxists in Montreal.  </p>

		<p>The article omits the following:</p>
<p>1). North Africans and black Africans may be fluent in French but they speak a patois that is hard for Quebecois to understand. Why hire a French speaker that your other workers, suppliers and customers can&rsquo;t communicate with?</p>
<p>2) The Catholic church in Quebec was very useful in bolstering French identity and culture in the past but, in recent years, has been more interested in swamping Quebec with undeserving, non-White immigrants. </p>
<p>3) The provincial government argues that the way to bolster French culture in Quebec is to encourage immigration from former French colonies. The flaw in this argument is that Haitians and Senegalese don&rsquo;t have the same culture, and don&rsquo;t see the survival of the Quebecois as a priority. They are, in fact, alien cultures. When they do assimilate, it is to black hip hop culture. They have nothing but hatred for the Quebecois.</p>

		<p>French-Canadians are loathed by other Canadians, but especially by non-whites.  They themselves are most vocally anti-American, but have been the most common diaspora of migrants.</p>
<p>Descended mostly from French riff-raff, street girls and native squaws, they form some fairly vicious crime cartels in the form of bikers.  They are tough, unfriendly to outsiders and unafraid to be belligerant to non-whites.</p>
<p>Jamaicans flooded their ghettos, and experienced horrendous racism, but have intermixed, as the Frenchmen are themselves more willing to intermarry with non-whites due to Catholism.</p>
