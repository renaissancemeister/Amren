<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/nyregion/23choir.html?ref=todayspaper">A Quiet End for Boys Choir of Harlem</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sharon Otterman, New York Times, December 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For more than three decades, they sang Mozart in Latin, Bach in German, and Cole Porter and Stevie Wonder in English, from Alice Tully Hall in New York to Royal Albert Hall in London.</p>
<p>For the audiences that marveled at the Boys Choir of Harlem, it was an additional wonder that the young performers with world-class voices had emerged from some of the most difficult neighborhoods of New York. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The choir&rsquo;s demise as a functional organization was a result of many factors, but everyone agrees it was set in motion by a single episode: an accusation by a 14-year-old boy in 2001 that a counselor on the choir&rsquo;s staff had sexually abused him. The counselor eventually was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
<p>The accusation and the scandal that followed  &mdash;  Dr. Turnbull did not report the claim to the authorities and allowed the counselor to continue working with children  &mdash;  set off a chain of events that led the city to oust the choir in 2006 from the Choir Academy of Harlem, the school building that had been its home. {snip}</p>
<p>Owing millions in payroll taxes and penalties, and immersed in a lawsuit stemming from the abuse accusations, the board of the Boys Choir gathered in the months after Dr. Turnbull&rsquo;s death, said Howard Dodson, the leader of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library. {snip}</p>

		<p>This is sad.  A positive experience for black children ruined.  And not by the pedophile but by the people in charge.  If the people in charge had reported the pedophile.  If the people in charge had followed standard accounting proceedures.  If the people in charge had been responsible these children would not have lost a postive oppertunity.  Sad.</p>

		<p>The alleged sexual abuse might have been real, in which case it was deja le meme chose wherever there are large groups of blacks, or it could have been made up, because the boy&rsquo;s family wanted to play the ghetto lottery.</p>

		<p>I saw the Harlem boys choir once during the 1990s. I really enjoyed watching them perform. There was a reception afterwards. I had the opportunity to speak to some of the young men. They  were gentlemen. Too bad this scandal destroyed this orgnanization.</p>

<p>If they sang Mozart in Latin and Bach in German, it can be certain that it was due to a huge amount of white coaching and especially financial support. This is something that blacks never do on their own. It&rsquo;s like a &#8220;perpetual motion&#8221; machine. It&rsquo;s an artificial state that falls apart the moment the hidden motive power is withdrawn, or, in this case, the thing just collapses under its own weight.</p>

		<p>Anything with blacks always ends up the same way. There is no way to help these people. How long has the White man tried to no avail? A thousand years or more? They are what they are, period.</p>

		<p>Sounds like the choir took a page from Mrs King&rsquo;s accounting course.  Rake in the donations, and refuse to pay salaries and taxes.  Hmmm, one might almost believe this to be typical black behavior and organizational management practices, eh?</p>

		<p>What a shame that those beautiful young voices must be silenced because of the actions of sleezy, criminal adults.</p>

		<p>This was a segregated organization! Maybe what they needed was some diversity! Have some whites, some &#8220;hispanics&#8221;, some orientals, and some girls. It is a &#8220;boys&#8221; choir but include the girls nonetheless. That may have worked. And there is no such thing as a &#8220;boy&#8221; in the black community. A &#8220;young man&#8221; or a man, but never a &#8220;boy&#8221;!</p>

		<p>Hey why doesn&rsquo;t Tiger Woods pay the bill. It would give him some good PR. I know his white wifey is gonna clean his clock but that still leaves 350 million. What about Michael Jordan, what about LeBron James, what about Adrian Peterson, what about Denzel Washington, what about any number of black athletes and performers who could get together and solve this problem. </p>

		<p>This is tragic.  I have heard the Harlem Boys&rsquo; Choir, and what a gift they were to the world!  I have a B.A. in music, and I so appreciate organizations that encourage and train talented young people in music.  Is there no foundation out there that could provide the funds necessary to rebuild this VERY worthy group?</p>

		<p>You Tube has no videos of the Boys Choir of Harlem singing Mozart or Bach. The only classical video is with Kathleen Shepherd (Rise up Shepherd). Does anyone have more information or is this just myth building?</p>
