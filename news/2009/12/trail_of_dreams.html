<h1>&#8216;Trail Of Dreams&rsquo; Immigration March to D.C. Starts in Miami Jan. 1</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Kane, South Florida Sun Sentinel (Ft. Lauderdale), Dec. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Jan. 1, four young people will lace up their sneakers and head north from Miami toward the nation&rsquo;s capital along U.S. 1. The group hopes that each step will bring more attention to the fact that thousands of undocumented individuals, many who have lived in the U.S. since they were small children, are barred each year from continuing their education in the U.S.</p>
<p>Guerra Casas, also one of the organizers, plans to walk with them from Hobe Sound to Fort Pierce.</p>
<p>&#8220;The purpose of all this is to let the American people, Congress and the president know that we are no longer afraid of being undocumented  &mdash;  that we are going to show who we are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are coming out of the shadows.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re calling it the Trail of Dreams, and the youth  &mdash;  associated with Students Working for Equal Rights and supported by the Florida Immigrant Coalition and Reform Immigration for America  &mdash;  plan to complete their trek to the National Mall by May 1.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The travelers would like to be joined in Washington by 100,000 supporters who will rally for the passage of the Development, Relief and Education Act for Alien Minors, or the DREAM Act.</p>
<p>The bill was introduced in both chambers of Congress in March with the intention of providing undocumented immigrant students who fit certain criteria a chance to earn conditional permanent residency.</p>
<p>Each year, tens of thousands of high school graduates can&rsquo;t pursue higher education because of their immigration status. The proposed legislation would put them on a conditional path to citizenship in exchange for the completion of a college degree or two years of military service.</p>
<p>But in an interview with USA Today, Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates less immigration, said the DREAM Act rewards &#8220;people who have broken the law with immigration benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, the walkers would like to see the passage of legislation that would prevent undocumented individuals from being separated from their families.</p>
<p>Only four individuals have signed up for the entire 1,052-mile trip, but hundreds  &mdash;  like Guerra Casas  &mdash;  will join them for small stretches.</p>

		<p>Unless you are one fortunate enough to live in a very remote, very rare, very white area, you are - like most of us - already well aware that the invaders aren&rsquo;t &#8220;in the shadows&#8221; at all, but right in our backyards! They are in our towns, in our schools, in our stores, restaraunts, in our neighborhoods! No, they aren&rsquo;t coming out of any shadow - they are asserting their will to dominate, and dominate they will if things don&rsquo;t change dramatically. This either stops now, or never - we have only one choice.     </p>

		<p>They can go study on a university in their country of citizenship, no rewarts for lying,  cheating and use of tax payers monies for those invaders. <br/>
No promise to a second (USA) citizenship, ever noticed they never mention the fact that those clowns all have a citizenship of their country of birth, they want us to give them a second citizenship. Born US citizen cannot have a second citizenship. These clowns only want to double dip.</p>

		<p>What gives them the right to a college education? The fact that their parents brought them here as children is no excuse to give them the rights of legal residents or US citizens. My advice is to go back to your own country. If this is not feasible, try to find another country that would accept you. The Dream Act is not going to pass anytime soon because the American people will not accept amnesty for illegal aliens. The Dream Act is just a form of amnesty in disguise.</p>

		<p>What in the world do these people think they will accomplish when they &#8220;take over?&#8221; Isn&rsquo;t that their goal? Since they&rsquo;ve had centuries to make their own countries great and have failed, do they really think they&rsquo;ll be successful at last? Let&rsquo;s suppose they reach the saturation point and we who have made this country great leave it to them. It wouldn&rsquo; take long for this to become the third world hellhole they&rsquo;ve escaped. Culture dies hard. They would then come running behind up in whatever utopia we&rsquo;ve found and it would begin all over. They cannot govern themselves, nor can they build a nation that recognizes the need for all people to have a chance. If they truly possessed the &#8220;macho&#8221; spirit they brag about, they&rsquo;d march in their own countries and demand their rights from their own leaders. They have none here with the exception of the right to leave and to stop committing the crime of breaking into our nation. And don&rsquo;t tell me America is a land of immigrants. All countries are. That does not give them he right to break the laws of this nation. Just ask them what rights Americans have who would think of breaking into Mexico. Our own government is complicit in this tragedy. Stop putting out the welcome mat! Citizenship is the greatest privilige we have. When you confer it on someone because their mother stepped across out borders minutes before they are born is unworthy of the law. We have a legal way to come here, but what happened to the laws that put limits on the numbers arriving from the same country? We must insist all illegal aliens leave - and it can be done - then put severe limits on immigrants. This does not include illegal aliens. Why don&rsquo;t the many pro-illegal organizations like La Raza work with Mexico and the other countries who urge their people to break our laws rather than aiding and abetting. They&rsquo;ve twisted things so much that suddenly we are &#8220;immigrant-haters.&#8221; If nothing else these groups have nerve. They feel the rising tide of illegal aliens have a perfect right to be here. Nothing is further from the truth. Nowhere in our Constitution does it say we must be invaded. Mexico declared war on us some time ago. Everyone knows that except our government. We fight for the borders of other countries to be inviolate, but leave ours open to the invaders and to the crime they bring with them. We must get everyone in Washington out who profits from illegal immigration. If there are those out there who can stand up to this invasion, please come forward to protect and defend this country as the oath demands.</p>

		<p>Post-1965 non-whites want NATOVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS to know that post 1965 nonwhites will have the political power  to vote NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS into an ever dwindlng racial minority within the borders of AMERICA.</p>
<p>Do not give numbersusa.com any $$$$$. Numbersusa.com makes the case against immigration based upon how it &#8220;harms&#8221; the legalized hispnic brethern-compliments of the big faker Ronnie Reagan-and their &#8220;American&#8221; children. What disgusting organization.</p>
<p>Peter Brimelow enough with the economic case against post-1965 immigration. The racial case is much stronger</p>

<p>I missed the first two weeks of kindergarten (in 1993), because Oregon had just passed a law requiring parents to provide their children&rsquo;s social security card for enrollment. My dad has a hard time tracking down my mother for the birth certificate.  </p>
<p>What happens when illegals cannot provide the paperwork? I suppose they let the kids in anyway, while making white families, who obviously did not hop the boarder, run through bureaucracy. </p>
<p>Seriously, anybody have a clue as to what administrators do in such a situation?<br/>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Seriously, anybody have a clue as to what administrators do in such a situation?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p> Schools are not allowed to turn down any student for any reason (including vaccinations)  &mdash;  they must accommodate all children: </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your government&rsquo;s policy viz. illegal alien children:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Existing law guarantees immigrant and non-English speaking students a free public education from kindergarten through grade twelve up until the age of twenty-one regardless of immigrant status. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that undocumented children have the same right as U.S. citizens and permanent residents to receive a free public education.</p>
<p>Because the law prohibits any action which might have a &#8216;chilling&rsquo; effect on the right of access to schools, districts must not require parents or adult care-takers to provide information concerning their or their children&rsquo;s immigration status&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p><br/>
Did you catch the part about &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; children having the same right to a &#8216;free&rsquo; public education as your U.S. Citizen children?  Free for them, satanic taxes for you.</p>
<p>Are you angry  &mdash;  no FURIOUS yet?</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;They&rsquo;re calling it the Trail of Dreams, and the youth &mdash; associated with Students Working for Equal Rights..&#8221;</p>
<p>Students Working for Equal Rights is a modern incarnation of the old 60s SDS and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].</p>
<p>These are the same type of foolish 60s &#8216;student radicals&rsquo; (with half the IQ of the original group) demanding &#8216;rights&rsquo; and destruction of the existing order (called &#8216;The Establishment&rsquo; in the 60s).   Judge Bork describes them in his book &#8216;Slouching Toward Gomorrah&rsquo; as: &#8216;Totalitarian in spirit, deeply antagonistic to traditional Western culture and proposing the complete restructuring of society.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Skip writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A big difference was that it was being used by indigenous peoples fighting off invading armies! THEY WON!!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I used the metaphor of the Ho Chi Minh Trail as Judge Bork uses it in &#8216;Slouching&rsquo;: to describe self-righteous, marxist student radicals that &#8220;marched&#8221; from Berkeley to Columbia to Yale (Bork was a law professor at Yale) to stir up violence, demand &#8216;rights&rsquo; and destroy &#8216;The Establishment.&rsquo;  The Counterculture implored young people to listen to their professors and agitators and not their parents  &mdash;   and as hard-core communists, then and now, they are dogmatic in their beliefs, irrational in logic and impervious to reason. </p>
<p>Judge Bork relates in &#8216;Slouching&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;When the first demonstrations broke out at Yale, a visiting professor pointed out that it was organized by a transfer student from Berkeley. At every university, he said, the first eruptions could be traced to a radical who had come down the Ho Chi Minh Trail from Berkeley&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>The 60s New Left now controls academia, the government and the levers of the current culture. Their ideas of liberty and equality have morphed into the specious, rigid &#8216;political correctness&rsquo; which begat Hate Speech and other forms of government oppression.</p>
<p>From tonight&rsquo;s postings:</p>
<p>..&ldquo;There has been a dramatic negative move in the Freedom Index this month, dropping for the first time below the dead-level-even mark of 50 on its 100-point scale&hellip;Nearly one voter in five said Americans are &#8216;not at all free&rsquo; to speak their minds without fear of punishment&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the legacy the New Left has left us with. And as the N. Vietnamese&hellip;</p>
<p>THEY WON!! </p>
