<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-12-15-deport_N.htm">Groups Try to Delay Deportations of Illegal Students</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Bazar, USA Today, December 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>He went to school in Chicago, joined the honor society and dreamed of becoming a lawyer  &mdash;  all while living here illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In January, the University of Illinois-Chicago junior was charged with drunken driving. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, paid a fine and got court supervision, but that brought him to the attention of immigration officials and triggered deportation proceedings. &#8220;It was one mistake in my life,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Padilla&rsquo;s impending deportation, originally set for today, catapulted him into a campaign to stop the deportation of college students and recent graduates. Lawmakers, students, members of the clergy and other activists hope to buy the students time and use their stories to push for laws that would allow them, and perhaps millions of other illegal immigrants, to earn legal status {snip}.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agreed last week to delay Padilla&rsquo;s deportation for a year, making him one of at least seven young illegal immigrants who have had their deportations delayed since June, according to DreamActivist, one of the groups spearheading the campaign. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to graduate college and give back to this country,&#8221; Padilla says.</p>
<p>{snip} The Chicago City Council passed a resolution in his behalf, and Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., introduced a bill specifically for him that would allow him to stay. &#8220;Why would we deprive ourselves of outstanding students and future leaders?&#8221; she asks. &#8220;They had no part in the decision to come here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Efforts toward overhaul</b></p>
<p>There are 12 million illegal immigrants in the USA. Activists call for an overhaul of immigration law that would offer them a way to earn legal status. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., introduced a bill Tuesday that would give illegal immigrants who pay fines, pass background checks and meet other requirements a path toward legal residency.</p>
<p>College students who are illegal immigrants fall under a separate proposal called the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act  &mdash;  the DREAM Act. Requirements would include arrival in the USA at 15 or younger, a five-year residency or more, and at least two years of college or military service. Versions of the act have been introduced since 2001 without success.</p>
<p>Each year, 65,000 illegal immigrants who have been here at least five years graduate from high school, says Jeffrey Passel of the non-partisan Pew Hispanic Center.</p>
<p>Deportation delays are rare, Rocha says; 400 were granted last year.</p>
<p>Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates less immigration, calls the DREAM Act amnesty, or &#8220;rewarding people who have broken the law with immigration benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>People in the country illegally &#8220;should be held responsible for the consequences to their children,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Flexibility in the law is important, says Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, which also calls for reduced immigration. &#8220;But delaying everybody&rsquo;s deportation because you hope the DREAM Act is going to happen does not make sense.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Other cases</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Herta Llusho, 20, of Detroit came to the USA from Albania on a tourist visa when she was 11. Her mother applied for asylum, she says, but it was denied, leaving them both with a deportation date of Aug. 19.</p>
<p>After supporters faxed more than 5,000 letters to ICE, she says, the University of Detroit Mercy sophomore and her mother won two delays. Their deportation was set for Feb. 1. Llusho hopes for another delay or for a lawmaker to introduce a bill on her behalf. &#8220;All we want is to work hard and keep at it and give back to the country that we believe has given so much to us,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>* Alonso Chehade, 22, of Poulsbo, Wash., arrived from Peru with his family on a tourist visa when he was 14. They stayed after it expired, he says. He was detained at the Canadian border in March when he says he crossed into Canada after going the wrong direction on the freeway.</p>
<p>Chehade, who received a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in business administration from the University of Washington this year, faced deportation on Sept. 25. {snip} Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., introduced a bill on his behalf, and his deportation was pushed to Jan. 5. {snip}</p>

		<p>&#8220;Illegals in US colleges just want to &ldquo;give back to the country that has given them so much.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Yeah, sure.  That&rsquo;s why they were photographed on numerous occassions running through the streets with the rags of their failed nations stretched high overhead as an act of conquest.</p>

		<p>So now we have &#8220;giving back to this country&#8221; something that non whites proclaim as the reason for demanding that whites give their country away to them?  We already gave it to the afro-nation-culturals, and what thanks do we get from them? What do they give back to us? Can we please have back the lives of Julie Love and Eve Carson? Can we have back all the money we&rsquo;ve wasted on closing the Achievement Gap?</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t want anything back. We&rsquo;ll just write it all off as the cost of a bad mistake if  ya&rsquo;ll non whites will just go back to where you came from and stay there. Take all the Martin Luther King, Jr. street signs with you. They&rsquo;ll be gone anyway, so ya&rsquo;ll might as well put them to good use in MLKberia, Sub Saraha, Africa.</p>

<p>How do you &#8220;earn&#8221; status of not having broken the law? You&rsquo;ve either done something illegal or you haven&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>With most crimes, murder being a notable example, restitution can never be paid. Not so with illegal immigration: much of the damage can be undone through deportation. </p>
<p>This is a fact that the leftists can&rsquo;t stand. That is why they have made up the canard of &#8220;earning&#8221; legal status. </p>
<p>Of course this article never questions this concept, but then this is from USA Today, one of the most PC newspapers in existence (which is saying something).</p>

		<p>Who is this Padillia guy? He has senators and congress persons wanting to rewrite the laws of our country for him. He has the chicago city council supporting him. These same people would consider an american citizen like me to be garbage. These changes in the law will take away my rights and my securities. He is a dangerous violent criminal, he has to go.<br>
   His reason for staying, He doesn&rsquo;t like Mexico! I have been to mexico the country is beautiful and the people are open and friendly. That is where you belong Padillia.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;All we want is to work hard and keep at it and give back to the country that we believe has given so much to us,&rdquo; she says&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This must be the new catch-phrase the activists tell illegal aliens to mouth like robots when facing deportation or White wrath.  I don&rsquo;t believe for one second any of them are grateful to &#8216;the country that has given them so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You can bet if the deportations are carried out they and their activist supporters will be screaming about hateful White Nazi.  They didn&rsquo;t hesitate to push aside a higher achieving White student and take his place at a college built and paid for by his parents&rsquo; tax money.</p>
<p>They come here to get as much Free White Money as they possibly can and take advantage of anti-White, government-enforced AA.  As for those to whom they should be thankful, they don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s&hellip;.(except to keep their benefits and perks coming). </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Why would we deprive ourselves of outstanding students and future leaders?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very good question, Ms. Representative.  Why do you think it&rsquo;s OK to push aside outstanding White students, possible future leaders, in favor of those who have broken our laws  &mdash;  AND excuse a drunk driver as well by rewarding him with a place in college?   </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be the first one ousted when THEIR numbers  &mdash;  due to YOUR stupid actions  &mdash;  outnumber those of your constituents.  Remember:  The people you&rsquo;re protecting WILL NOT support you and will never vote for you and your kind, only their own.  And it will happen because of idiots like you. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;dreamed of becoming a lawyer &mdash; all while living here illegally&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>He dreams of becoming a race-based, anti-White activist, promoting for his own people only, making demands that Whites turn over their wealth and property to his people, and above all, fight to bring more of his minions from their Third World hells to take advantage of &#8216;the stupid country that has given him so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Deport &#8216;em all, the sooner the better  &mdash;   and the politicians who support breaking American laws.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m about to expose my naivety about how things can be so corrupt, but I just don&rsquo;t understand how illegal&rsquo;s can gain admittance to college.  I have put 2 of my children through the Penn State system, and I&rsquo;m telling you, without a S.S.# and a host of other identification requirements, I just don&rsquo;t see it happening.  It really is a pain in the you know what to go through the admittance process.  Then there&rsquo;s the whole financial aide side of things which is even more stringent with identification requirements.  You would think a red flag the size of Texas would start waving around someone trying to bypass all those forms.  Maybe I just don&rsquo;t know how to think the way illegal&rsquo;s do, dishonestly.</p>

		<p>Yes.  The wanna-be lawyer surely wants to graduate and &#8220;give back&#8221; to this country.  What he wants to &#8220;give back&#8221; is the shaft.  He will, immediately upon passing the bar, become an immigration lawyer tying up our courts with pleas to allow other illegals the same &#8220;opportunity&#8221; he received.  He will be in the forefront of La Raza (perhaps another attorney on their staff) trying to eliminate free speech and the truth about the costs of illegal immigration.  Etc.  </p>

		<p>So the reason the criminal alien invader is kicking and screaming to avoid deportation is because he wants to &#8220;give&#8221; to us, and he&rsquo;s sticking with this story?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want your &#8220;gift&#8221; Mr. Padilla.  Now go away.</p>
