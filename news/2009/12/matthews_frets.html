			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brad Wilmouth, NewsBusters, December 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the Sunday, December 13, syndicated Chris Matthews Show, as he ended the show with words of praise for Morgan Freeman&rsquo;s latest film, Invictus, and its depiction of Nelson Mandela uniting blacks and whites in South Africa in the 1990s, host Matthews referred to &#8220;white tribalism&#8221; having been stirred up in America, and showed clips of anti-Obama protesters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While one of the three clips of protesters did show someone holding a sign with an image of President Obama with the words &#8220;undocumented worker&#8221; on it  &mdash;  reminiscent of the fringe conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in America  &mdash;  another clip showed protesters displaying generic anti-liberal and anti-socialism messages, while the third clip showed a sign with the words, &#8220;You lie!&#8221; invoking South Carolina Republican Congresssman Joe Wilson&rsquo;s outburst from the last State of the Union Address.</p>
<p>Below is a complete transcript of the closing segment of the Chris Matthews Show from Sunday, December 13:<blockquote>Welcome back. A small story can carry a large truth. This weekend, the movie Invictus opens in theaters around the country. It&rsquo;s about South Africa, how President Nelson Mandela cheered his country&rsquo;s rugby team to the World Cup in 1995. The movie&rsquo;s about race, about country, humanity, and, of course, hope. And you don&rsquo;t have to ask: It was made by Americans. Directed by Clint Eastwood, it was really Morgan Freeman&rsquo;s film. You&rsquo;ve heard this said about other actors in great performances, but he really is Nelson Mandela in this movie. The great man once said he wanted Freeman to play him if it ever came to this. America&rsquo;s greatest actor found this story and made this powerful thing happen, this majestic movie about what a leader can be.</p>
<p>In this world of ours today, it seems that any idiot  &mdash;  almost any idiot can rally the forces of tribalism, including white tribalism in this country. You can do it with a frown or a smile  &mdash;  easiest thing in the world to rile people back to their roots, get them thinking with all the rage of their grandparents. What takes someone historically wonderful is the ability, the will and the wile to unite people who are divided by history and past wrongs.</p>
<p>This is what Nelson Mandela  &mdash;  freed from 28 years in prison on Robin Island  &mdash;  did when, in his first year as President, he cheered on the white South African rugby team  &mdash;  treasured by the whites of his country, hated by the black majority, and in so doing showed himself a leader to all. A small story with a large soul. A South African story told by Americans who know of what we speak. That&rsquo;s the show. Thanks for watching. See you here next week.<br>

		<p>Morgan Freeman is as much a fabrication of the media as Barack Obama. He is has been cast as the President and God or some wise scientist or saint. Does anyone recall that Morgan Freeman was having a sexual affair with his granddaughter. I feel sorry for anyone who takes seriously anything Chris Mathews says.</p>

		<p>Clint Eastwood is now officially a race traitor.  After making &#8216;Gran Torino&rsquo; with its anti-White message and marrying a multi-racial woman, Dina Ruiz (he also has a daughter with her), &#8216;Invictus&rsquo; is the final proof.</p>

		<p>In a recent interview, Clint Eastwood didn&rsquo;t provide much enlightenment on his own personal views about race.  He said people &#8220;could learn&#8221; about people unlike themselves.</p>
<p>I came away from reading the article with a diminished impression of the man, that he&rsquo;s simply a script-reader out of his depth with the topic of race. </p>

		<p>This Matthews is just too ignorant, stupid and naive to be addressing the public on any matter.</p>
<p>His show has had the lowest ratings of ALL shows in that time slot for years now, but they keep him on.  Certainly he is being protected by strong political forces, who place the advancement of their agenda before profits.</p>
<p>Matthews&rsquo; &#8220;thrill up my leg&#8221; has made him the laughing stock of the country and he&rsquo;s regarded by anyone with any intelligence as a buffoon, which, of course, he is.</p>

		<p>Mr. Matthews, take a hint:  Invictus is a work of fiction.</p>
<p>Besides that, about the only people who know that Matthews said it is the News Busters website and now the regulars at AR.  Otherwise, if a tree falls in the forest, and MSNBC covers it, does it make a sound?  I&rsquo;ll leave that one for the philosophers.</p>

		<p>Dear Chris Matthews,</p>
<p>Do you live in a nice neighborhood? Does it reflect more of the white tribe or the afrocultural tribe? Is your boss and board of directors reflect more of the white tribe or the afrocultural tribe? If you are surrounded by the white tribe, are you endangered? Why don&rsquo;t you go and work for the afrocultural tribe at Black Entertainment TV?</p>

<p>Beware ladies and gentlemen, The Tingler is on the loose again!</p>
<p>There are few Marxstream media types that so openly revel in their hatred of decent white Americans, as Comrade Matthews. Certainly none of them are what you would call prizes, but Comrade Matthews simply delights in it; he is truly freakish in his contempt for his own race to the point of being shocking, even by the contemptible &ldquo;standards&rdquo; of MSNBC.</p>
<p>This latest little anti-white tirade of his, only demonstrates this fact all too clearly. How dare anyone question his mulatto &ldquo;savior&rdquo; the glorious General Secretary BO? After all, he is only destroying the economy both through his Marxist ineptitude; and should his &ldquo;universal&rdquo; healthcare plan get passed, by way of his grandiose megalomania. But what difference does that make to a leering multicultural buffoon like Comrade Matthews, and the orgasmic euphoria he experiences because of his racially &ldquo;transformative&rdquo; demigod?</p>
<p>A racially warped mind, is a terrible thing to witness!</p>
<p>On a related topic, has anyone seen this video of Margret Hoover (yes, she is the great granddaughter of the late President Hoover) making an abject fool of herself on the FOX News Channel from the 10/22/09 edition of &ldquo;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor&rdquo;? It is quite a sickening spectacle and interestingly, I have not seen her on FOX for quite sometime after it happened. Enjoy:</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that Eastwood would have anything to do with this type of film. Isn&rsquo;t he a conservative! The only thing I can imagine is that he knew that ANY film made on Mandela would be a shoe in for an oscar [ don&rsquo;t want to appear racissss ]. He just wants another home run before checking out.</p>

		<p>Mark today as the day of another rising in the tide of white awareness. Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s show tonight reported on the &#8220;white privilege&#8221; studies program recommended for Univ. of Minnesota.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard Beck or Limbaugh use the term. Everyone should have been using it often, because it is a weapon of the left. Whites need to know about it and use it as a weapon of their own against the left.</p>
<p>Finally, today, we have in the public discussion the left&rsquo;s usage of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; against white people. The more white people get to know about it, the more they will understand that white privilege is something to cherish and protect. It is stolen and destroyed by white liberals who collude with hostile and dangerous afroculturals.</p>
<p>As offensive as Bill O&rsquo;Reilly usually is, we owe him a thanks for raising awareness how &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is considered evil by the left. </p>
<p>Have any of you taken a white privilege course or read a Peggy McIntosh essay or Tim Wise book?  You will learn that white privilege is based upon systemic racism, and if you will deny yourself the opportunities and power your hard work has earned for you, and if you will now strive to make certain that blacks are given the best admissions, scholarships, and careers, then you are dismantling racism and are a good Obama loving American.</p>
<p>The white haters don&rsquo;t hate privilege, they just don&rsquo;t want whites to have anything we deserve, so they frame genius, creativity, and achievement as a evil racist power and privilege. The end goal is for blacks ending up with the power and privilege, but because it was given to them by coerced whites, not earned by them.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Reilly didn&rsquo;t go far enough. He left out the &#8220;unearned&#8221; part of the &#8220;white privilege&#8221; label. His conservative audience needs to be confronted with the enemies of their &#8220;unearned white privilege&#8221;. Please, Jared Taylor, work your magic and get that awareness into the public media channels.</p>
<p>Our enemies aren&rsquo;t the egalitarians who just need to understand that low afrocultural IQ&rsquo;s are genetic, but the covens and gangs who will actively demand that we renounce our earned white opportunities and hand everything over to the afros for free.</p>
<p>Hideous white feminist are the primary agitprop group in this war against us and our earned white primacy.<br>

		<p>It is absolutely incredible that a major motion picture can be made about a convicted terrorist, puffing up the idea that a sports game helped &#8220;unite&#8221; a country, while the country in question is collapsing into ruin in the wake of post-apartheid rule.</p>
<p>Thousands of White South African farmers have been brutally murdered, and several times as many urban White South Africans have been murdered, raped, robbed, assaulted.  A huge number of them have fled their country to escape the madness.</p>
<p>Yet even as this madness plays out in REAL LIFE, Americans will throng their way to the movie theater and watch a mythical version of history where Black and White South Africans joined together and lived happily ever after in a sunshine-and-rainbows party of brotherly love.  </p>
<p>Most incredibly of all, the vast majority of them will believe to the very marrow of their bones that what they have seen in the theater is REAL.</p>
<p>It sickens me to see Eastwood become such a useful tool of those who program us for our own destruction.</p>

		<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ve always rather enjoyed Morgan Freeman as an actor, usually artfully playing the decent and good black man without a nasty chip on his shoulder or some sort of agenda.</p>
<p>As for that intellectual featherweight Chris Matthews, perhaps someone would like to remind him of what&rsquo;s become of South Africa since Nelson Mandela and his followers gained control of that hapless nation.  And we might want to bring his wife, Winnie &#8220;The Necklace) Mandela into the discussion.  The sad fact of the matter is that black rule, characterized by Mr. Mandela, has been an unmitigated disaster for South Africa and all its inhabitants, black and white.  </p>

		<p>Matthews lives in Potomac Maryland, a wealthy DC suburb which is over 90 percent white.  Once saw a full body film clip of him walking, he had the modified goose step, legs kicking out awkwardly, and high water pants.  Similar to the journalists at Time &amp; Newsweek magazine, these people hate our nation and  society because they themselves do not fit in, and in vengeance they fellow travel with the MSM moguls to tear down this country.  Look at the face of Paul Krugman, does he look like a confident inspiring person?<br>

		<p>Chris Mathews comes across as someone who has had a lobotomy and then is given too much Ritalin. His ignorance seems matched only by his inflated ego. </p>
<p>It seems he has blinders on - after graduating from Holy Cross he ended up in the Peace Corps - in Swaziland no less. Years later he spent a good deal of time reporting on politics from South Africa as that country began its long downward spiral after the government changed. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that those experiences - along with being from (a racially ruined) Philadelphia - he&rsquo;d have some trepidation about trusting blacks with any real responsibility, or the white liberals behind the pro-black, entitlement-driven, anti-white agenda. He must be clueless. Also, I&rsquo;m sure he lives in a neighborhood that does not reflect his politics.</p>
<p>Basically, he&rsquo;s a composite of some of the morons who voted for Obama. The lazy-thinking, self-important, one-sided liberal who has been brainwashed into a haze of white guilt and dismissive of the white heritage that brought America to power. </p>
<p>These truly superficial &#8220;thinkers&#8221; are the people who buy into revisionist history, who have convinced themselves that &#8220;we are all equal&#8221; in spite of overwhelming and obvious evidence, who rely on misguided personal emotions to define the issues, and who cannot see the consequence of their beliefs upon the next generation.</p>
<p>People such as Mathews will spend their entire lives searching for something that doesn&rsquo;t exist while creating excuses for why it is just out of reach. Sorry Chris, Africa will never get its act together, blacks will always score at the bottom of an IQ test and be at the top of crime statistics, and no amount of money, prodding, finger-pointing, or wishful thinking will change this.</p>
<p>Mathews probably thinks his take on race makes him noble. It actually makes him a coward. He has abandoned civilization and used his media access to essentially promote cultural suicide.      </p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m no great admirer of Mr. Nelson Mandela. He remains a committed Marxist. He is also a former violent terrorist who was once banned from the United States. Along with the ANC, Nelson Mandela has moved South Africa down a slippery path of crime and corruption that will eventually end in the birth of another Zimbabwe.</p>

		<p>Promoting the causes of non-whites, and diversity (which always means discrimination against white men), isn&rsquo;t considered &#8216;idiocy&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s considered enlightenment and folks like Mathews have to play along for the sake of job security. And be enthusiastic and a real pioneer about it to be considered enlightened or at least to provide a little more safety. But no one is every really safe as even the most &#8216;progressive&rsquo; are sometimes thrown under the bus of political correctness. </p>

<p>Chris Mathews recieves his paycheck from the military industrial complex&hellip;good old treasonous Genral Electric which has made billions from death and destruction. As I have written here many times:the race-replacememt of Native Born White Americans is inseparable from Republican-Democratic party war mongering on behalf of &hellip;.General Electric. </p>
<p>A moratorium isn&rsquo;t good enough. Only a permanent shut down of all non-white LEGAL IMMIGRATION  is acceptable&hellip;Peter Brimleow. The moratorium strategy implies that a labor scarcity would be a bad thing for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. This is nonsense. </p>

		<p>Please wake to current events past.  When mandela came here our leaders couldn&rsquo;t kiss his black rear enough; talk about worship!  He even addressed a joint session of congress. </p>
<p>Do you still need to question where the loyalties of our leaders stand?  </p>
<p>We know what mandela is, we know the absolute white genocide going on in SA, we know they are fast becoming a regressive culture, a tribal culture, 25% of whites have fled the country for safety, a once leader in this world, fast becoming just like New Orleans.  </p>
<p>Get real.  See eastwood, mandela, freeman for what they are&hellip;see the outcome for what it is, not some fuzzy fake feeling.</p>

		<p><em>A South African story told by Americans who know of what we speak.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s precisely Americans who thought they knew better who are responsible for the state of South Africa today.  We had the situation under control, despite the money, arms, training and bases the ANC received from the Church of England, Russia, China, Cuba and their proxies in neighbouring countries.  Militarily, we kicked their butts in their own bases (which was the only time the brave &#8220;freedom fighters&#8221; ever came close to an actual fight).  It was only when the American government took it upon itself to destroy our economy that we were forced to hand over our country.</p>
<p>Eastwood&rsquo;s premise in this movie will look ridiculous to you, but, believe it or not, a lot of people believed it at the time. A (non-white) colleague said to me, years after the event, that the 1995 Rugby World Cup had given him hope that the New! Improved! South Africa might actually work. Silly, of course, but you have to understand that, in South Africa, rugby is a religion.  For years SA had been barred from international competition on the grounds that the national team was not representative (Whites only). After Mandela&rsquo;s (spit!) democratic election, SA was readmitted to world rugby, and the (all-White) team promptly won the world cup.  It seemed that the entire country (I won&rsquo;t say &#8216;nation&rsquo;) was united behind the team.  The national airline buzzed the stadium with a Boeing 747.  The euphoria actually convinced some people that we might have a chance.</p>
<p>Certainly, if  Mandela (spit!) had  given in to pressure to stop the SA team from competing, he would have had trouble on his hands.  As it was, he (at best) delayed the inevitable disillusionment.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I was surprised to read (Jewish American Patriot @ 7:15) that Matthews has actually been in South Africa. Not that we don&rsquo;t already have many brain-dead leftist &#8220;journalists&#8221; who deny the evidence of their own lying eyes, but this one is over the top. Maybe Matthews knows that Mandela was not imprisoned on &#8220;Robin Island&#8221;, but on Robben Island. It&rsquo;s a Dutch word meaning &#8220;seals&#8221;. Then again, maybe he doesn&rsquo;t. But apparently he has no excuse for his monumental ignorance, and certainly no justification for his colossal arrogance.  What a clot.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how anyone could put Morgan Freeman in the category of top actor of any kind. The guy plays the same role in every movie  &mdash;  flat, one-dimensional characters who speak in a monotone. </p>

		<p>Or, is this but a way to boost ratings?  Race means everything contrary to conventional wisdom, and that means it is interesting even if what is dicussed is in PC speak.</p>

		<p>I have a slightly different take, I think Matthews is saying such things because he wants white people to wake up and see the reality of what is happening in the US. Pat Buchanan regularly appears on the show for no simple reason. The fact that most super libs never mention race is no mistake. Matthews does so because he knows the truth, although he does so subliminaly. I dont like him but I think that may be what is going on here, by the way I do follow him, dont think he is a big fan on illegal immigration, once again, I am no fan of Matthews, but I do question his technique.</p>

		<p>Chris Matthews is a propaganda machine.Think for a moment,fat people are everywhere they were not everywhere twenty years ago in fact most fat people were black women.Most people have cable in fact that FCC ruling ensured it.Have you ever tried watching tv through one of those boxes(if you don&rsquo;t have cable).It&rsquo;s atrocious!HaHa we&rsquo;ll make them pay for something they previously enjoyed for free.You are constantly bombarded by misinformation,constantly.Does it not strike you as unusual that they can&rsquo;t find BinLaden?The man is freakishly tall for an Arab.I know this because I was tasked with finding him in the nineties most Arabs are like 5&rsquo;8&#8221;.What of the others Nancy Grace?Wikipedia?Cnn en totale?You have been indoctrinated and blinded and turned into frightened dullards.The media lies!My god the blacks have turned South Africa into a virtual garden of eden.Genocide of Boer farmers?The thing that has always shocked me is even if a black is well(expensively) educated they despise Mister Charlie.I have been to Africa and it&rsquo;s rather horrible.Most countries were far better off with white rule.As far as Mr.Eastwood,well the Hollywood bunch is most assuredly a bunch of erudite moralists now aren&rsquo;t they?Phil Spector,O.J.,Roman Polanski.And of course I believe Eastwood has several illegitimate children.Certainly a pillar of virtue and an accredited teacher.But let&rsquo;s face it a skilled propagandist.That is all.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a movie based on the book  &#8220;The great betrayal&#8221; By Ian Smith,&hellip;directed by Eastwood&hellip;to show an alternate view. It appears that in the sixties the turning point of modern world hinged. Ian Smith was yesterdays version of the dignified, intelligent white man&hellip;that has been deposed by the philosophy of today. Smith, it seems to me had a more realistic and less emotional mindset. My knowledge of Rhodesia and SA is not large or first hand but both these nations were apparently safer and more prosperous before majority black rule. The details that emotionalists didn&rsquo;t want to see is that blacks were aided by white minority rule and if wise could have learned from whites in eventually assuming more progressive lifestyles themselves. Instead the world hammered away at Smith despite his staunch grit (A grit he also diplayed in defending the free world in WWII). The blacks led by Mugabe prefering to hate and destroy what yhey could have learned and prospered from.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Apartheid&#8221; was put in place to keep the various black &#8220;tribes&#8221; from killing each other.  What most people (still) don&rsquo;t understand is that apartheid restricted whites as much as blacks or &#8220;coloreds&#8221;.<br>
South Africa under apartheid had an influx of black immigrants because life there was much better than in the rest of Africa.<br>
An informal form of &#8220;apartheid&#8221; (although technically illegal in the USA due to the misguided &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws) is practiced every day by those of us Americans who are race realists.<br>
No form of legislation can deny basic human nature.</p>
