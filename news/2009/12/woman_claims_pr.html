<h1>Woman Claims Profiling Following Strip Search</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tony Spears, Can West News Service, Dec. 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Ottawa woman returned home from her grandmother&rsquo;s funeral to be handcuffed, strip-searched and accused of drug-smuggling by Canadian customs agents at the Ottawa airport this week.</p>
<p>Charmaine Archer, 42 and a nurse&rsquo;s assistant at an Ottawa longtime care facility, was on a flight Tuesday from Philadelphia, the last leg of her trip home from Jamaica. She and her 4-year-old son were pulled aside for inspection by border services agents at the airport as they left the plane around 11 p.m. &#8220;I noticed I was the only one in that area,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Agents told Archer, who is a Canadian citizen, she was flagged because she paid for part of her ticket with a credit card, because she booked last minute and because she only stayed for four days. Agents took what she described as gauze swabs and ran them over her wallet, the lining of her suitcase and even her toothbrush. This took over an hour, Archer said.</p>
<p>Her toothbrush, agents said, tested positive for heroin and THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. &#8220;I said &#8216;you&rsquo;re a liar.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t do drugs, I don&rsquo;t know anybody that does drugs and I wasn&rsquo;t around drugs when I was in Jamaica&hellip; .   I come from an upstanding family and nobody touched that toothbrush but me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agents told her she would have to submit to a strip search.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said to her, &#8216;No way that&rsquo;s going to happen! My husband don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s inside my rectum and neither will you.&#8221; She was threatened with arrest and told her child would be sent to Children&rsquo;s Aid, Archer said.</p>
<p>The boy was eventually allowed to join his father, who was waiting in the airport to pick up his family. Archer was handcuffed and she eventually agreed to be searched. &#8220;I got undressed. There were three women in the room  &mdash;  quite humiliating, quite degrading. I&rsquo;m a big person, very conscious of my body&hellip; .   You can imagine how I felt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They made me stand up and hold my arm up and they made me lift up my breast. Then she told me to turn around and bend all the way over with my feet wide apart. And then she told me to use my hand and open my rectum. They told me to put one foot forward then squat and cough &hellip; they told me to lift up my belly and they told me open my feet apart and to pry my legs apart and they looked underneath my crotch.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it was over &#8220;they asked if I wanted to take a minute to sit down,&#8221; since she was shaking and crying. They offered to help repack her bag and two male officers put her bags on a trolley to bring them down to her waiting husband. It was 2 a.m., and they had found no drugs. &#8220;They never apologized, never said anything,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They thought they had a big fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is by no means isolated,&#8221; said Ewart Walters, editor of the Spectrum, a monthly newspaper aimed at Ottawa&rsquo;s black community. &#8220;There have been enough incidents over the years of people being picked on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed to Leon Stewart, who was held for three hours at the airport in March, 2000. Like Archer, he was strip-searched, only Stewart was asked to produce a bowel movement to satisfy customs agents he wasn&rsquo;t concealing drugs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an overwhelming number of black people coming from Jamaica who get stopped and asked questions.&#8221; Walters said.</p>
<p>Canadian Border Services Agency representatives were not immediately available to comment.<br>

		<p>There were virtually no blacks at all in Canada until the 1960&rsquo;s when the Liberals, especially under Trudeau, began letting them in. They have been nothing but trouble ever since and the Jamaicans are by far the worst of the lot.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I noticed I was the only one in that area&#8221;<br>
I did a little profiling myself at Canadian customs. And I noticed I was the only one one that area&hellip; the only White guy that is. Out of twelve immigration officers across the green line (thats not a hockey term folks, it`s an immigration one) I was the only White guy either entering Canada, or checking documents. East Timor, Jamacia, Nigeria. ALL of the agents were from Third world countries. Talk about policy being out front and on display!! When asked the PURPOSE of my visit to Canada, I wanted to ask, &#8220;Why is a guy from across the world asking a guy from  right across the border what his program is&#8221; ?!?  Dudley Do-right phone home immediately!!</p>

		<p>Those customs people should be paid danger money. They sure aren&rsquo;t doing this stuff for fun.</p>

		<p>Well I, for one, think that anyone paying for a plane ticket should be treated with a certain amount of courtesy.  If I were strip-searched like that, I would not be understanding or forgiving.  Profuse thanks for cooperating, and maybe even some freebies (sky miles, maybe?&hellip;.many thousands of them?) might cushion the blow.  But it would still be traumatic.  It would be the last time I ever boarded a commercial airplane.  So what if they smuggle drugs in?  Don&rsquo;t a lot of them die, acting as mules?  </p>
<p>But as to the other issue.  No, there should not be even one Jamaican allowed residency in Canada.  They should not even be allowed to have an embassy there.  If horrible people from horrible places were not allowed into Canada, there would be no need for drug searches.</p>

		<p>Trudeau pushed for multiculturalism.  His right hand man for internationalism was an East Asian gentleman from Malaysia named Lewis Perinbam (educated in Britain and married to a white woman, of course).</p>
<p>Trudeau took the baby steps to opening the borders by welcoming the Vietnamese &#8216;boat people&rsquo;, some of whom had never seen a flush toilet before arriving in Canada. </p>
<p>It was his successor Brian Mulroney who opened the doors wide.  While Reagan was doing the same in the U.S., Mulroney raised immigration in Canada to a quarter million a year, including such notable disasters as Caribbean blacks, Tamils and Somalis. </p>

		<p>They may (or may not?) have misplaced their suspicions on this particular woman, but they certainly targeted the right group (Jamaicans). They weren&rsquo;t wrong on that point. </p>
<p>And she sounds like a tough,  mouthy piece of work   &mdash;   which may explain a lot.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I have a hernia which requires a strap device to hold. I have been subjected to some very humiliating searches and questions in airports. <i> (&#8220;Security! Male search!  He&rsquo;s got something hidden under his clothes!&#8221;) </i> </p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s very exasperating, embarassing, but I never got any apologies from them afterwards.  And furthermore, those bossy guards are rarely white (and I&rsquo;ll bet the ones in Ottawa weren&rsquo;t either).  Nor could I claim that I was a victim of racial discrimination or profiling, being just a white American with no special minority rights.   </p>
<p>Another thing, Tim McHugh is on the mark about the Third World crew checking your documents in Canada. I grew up within miles of the Canadian border (near Buffalo), feeling almost an honorary Canadian. I have gone through Canadian airports many times,  from Vancouver to Ottawa, and there is something truly bizarre about being asked by a bearded Sikh, or Yemeni, or Somali what is your reason for visiting Canada, exactly what hotel you&rsquo;ll be staying in, and even how much money you&rsquo;re carrying!   I feel like asking them what is THEIR reason for being in Canada?</p>

<p>6  &mdash;  Anonymous wrote at 3:08 AM, your comment reminds me of a Canadian friend of mine flying back into Toronto from a business trip to US. The Customs agent going over his documents was a Muslim woman wearing a veil. My friend&rsquo;s reaction   &mdash;   which of course he had to keep to himself and couldn&rsquo;t say out loud   &mdash;   was: &#8220;YOU are gonna decide if I&rsquo;M Canadian enough to be let into Canada?&#8221; </p>
<p>Although there is probably no way (at present) to limit Customs officials to native-born citizens of heritage (i.e. European) stock, <i>at a minimum</i> our govts should ban from Airport/Customs workers the wearing of OBVIOUS signs of allegiances to foreign ideologies and faiths: the various veils, turbans, crocheted skull-doilies, religiously-motivated facial hair (e.g. the scraggly, unkempt beard &#8220;long enough to hide a fist&#8221; demanded by certain Islamic sects) and other blatant, <i>deliberate</i> affronts and insults to Western traditions and sensibilities. </p>
<p>That way, those arriving at our airports will be less confused about which country it is they&rsquo;re entering   &mdash;   and not be left wondering if they maybe boarded the wrong flight and ended up in some place like Iran or Pakistan. </p>
