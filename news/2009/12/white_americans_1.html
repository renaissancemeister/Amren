<h1>White Americans&rsquo; Majority to End by Mid-Century</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, Google News, December 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The estimated time when whites will no longer make up the majority of Americans has been pushed back eight years  &mdash;  to 2050  &mdash;  because the recession and stricter immigration policies have slowed the flow of foreigners into the U.S.</p>
<p>Census Bureau projections released Wednesday update last year&rsquo;s prediction that white children would become a minority in 2023 and the overall white population would follow in 2042. The earlier estimate did not take into account a drop in the number of people moving into the U.S. because of the economic crisis and the immigration policies imposed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.</p>
<p>The United States has 308 million people today; two-thirds are non-Hispanic whites.</p>
<p>The total population should climb to 399 million by 2050, under the new projections, with whites making up 49.9 percent of the population. Blacks will make up 12.2 percent, virtually unchanged from today. Hispanics, currently 15 percent of the population, will rise to 28 percent in 2050.</p>
<p>Asians are expected to increase from 4.4 percent of the population to 6 percent.</p>
<p>The projections are based on rates for births and deaths and a scenario in which immigration continues its more recent, slower pace of adding nearly 1 million new foreigners each year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The actual shift in demographics will be influenced by a host of factors that can&rsquo;t be accurately forecast  &mdash;  the pace of the economic recovery, cultural changes, natural or manmade disasters, as well as an overhaul of immigration law, which may be debated in Congress as early as next year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The agency also released numbers showing projections based on &#8220;high&#8221; rates of immigration  &mdash;  more likely if more-flexible government policies and a booming U.S. economy attract large numbers of foreigners  &mdash;  as well as &#8220;low&#8221; immigration, a possible scenario if U.S. policies don&rsquo;t change much while the economy substantially improves.</p>
<p>_With high immigration, the minority &#8220;tipping point&#8221; is moved up to 2040, two years earlier than the previous estimate. At that time, Asians would have a much larger share, at 8 percent, since their population growth is more dependent on immigration than birth rates.</p>
<p>_With low immigration, the &#8220;tipping point&#8221; arrives by 2045.</p>
<p>Under a purely theoretical &#8220;zero immigration&#8221; scenario in which the U.S. effectively does not take in any immigrants, whites would remain the majority in 2050, making up a solid 58 percent of the U.S. population. In such a case, the share of Hispanics would increase to 21 percent because of high fertility rates and a younger population.<br>

		<p>Because there isn&rsquo;t really any immigration enforcement, I think the tipping point will be well before 2040.  And because government bureaucrats like to inflate the number of white people by adding certain white-ish Muslims as &#8220;white,&#8221; then it will probably be around 2030.</p>

		<p>According to data from the Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2000 Census, there were 35,000,000 Hispanics living in America. 28% of 400,000,000 is 112,000,000. So if the predictions are accurate, America would add 77 million Hispanics to our population in just half of a century. If such trends persist, Hispanics will undoubtedly outnumber whites sometime during the 22nd century.</p>
<p>Even more alarming is that white babies will be the minority by 2023. If that doesn&rsquo;t frighten you, you&rsquo;re insane.</p>
<p>Adding so many Hispanics, the majority of which do not consider themselves Americans first, to the American population will have severe consequences. As statistics prove, Hispanics are generally averse to education and have lower incomes, even after they&rsquo;ve been here for several generations. The implications of these depressing demographic prospects are that an Hispanic America would undoubtedly resemble something like Mexico and other Third World countries. Since whites will be in the minority, America will probably most of all resemble Brazil by the end of this century.</p>
<p>If Europe comes to its senses and decides that an Islamic majority would not preserve Western civilization, I predict that there will be an exodus of white Americans to Europe, much like how there&rsquo;s an exodus of Boers who are fleeing black majority rule.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re always ready to print a story intended to intimidate those whites who refuse to accept multiculturalism with projections 40 years away, when they can even correctly forcast what is going to occur in the next year or two on many different things, some of which include demographics.</p>
<p>This is a psyops piece.  They won&rsquo;t be writing them by the end of 2010 or early 2011.</p>
<p>They WILL, however, be telling us how far fewer dollars are being sent out of the country and they will cite the number of Mexicans who returned home, because they couldn&rsquo;t find work and were unable to support themselves on just selling dope and stealing.</p>
<p>They are such optimists regarding the economic picture when the best economic minds in the country are all doom and gloom over worsening conditions.</p>

<p>Is there a third party out there who would enforce zero-immigration? If so, tell me here so I can hang my hat with them.</p>

		<p>I`ve come to realize, after serving during the last Balkan war, that the phenomena of balkanization is occuring here in the USA.  I believe that the influx of hostile, poor, and uneducated Hispanics will lead to &#8220;White flight&#8221; and intaractable violence.  </p>
<p>Will America become another Kosovar and Serbia?  I argue that the parallels are already apparent.  Maybe it`s time to promote a White state?</p>

		<p>It doesnt make a big difference if we are 45% of 55%. There always will be a lot of whites who want a lot of nonwhite immmigration into this country because they have always lived in places that were almost all whitebread, and they want to see more &#8220;people of color&#8221;. If they are forced to live like the rest of us working class peons, they will do a 180 degree turnaround.</p>

		<p>I recall very well in the early 1970&rsquo;s the Chicago columnist Jack Mabley predicted that the U.S. will be a non-white, non-English speaking nation by 2035. He had evidently picked up this bit of news from a University of Chicago demographer. That demographer had told all his children to learn several additional languages beyond English as this country would become so unruly and a hell on earth! We seem to be well on the way? And those predictions and projections will become invalid if the current crop of illegals are given amnesty. Things will become far worse if the illegals are given a &#8220;path&#8221;!</p>

		<p>Except for a brief period of the last couple of years the date has been 2050 since they first came out with this story in 1987.  How is that even possible?  In 1987 the number of immigrants coming into the country was around 600,000 a year.  If they were basing projections on the then current immigration flows, the rate since then has fluctuated every year but it has never been at that lower level since.  The current level is over 1 million a year.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also wondering if illegal aliens are calculated into this because if they&rsquo;re not, an amnesty would move the date up considerably.  The US is currenty 60 percent White and given the Census&rsquo; proclivity for counting Middle Easterners and North Africans as White, it stands to reason that they are also counted as White in this projection.</p>

Your Balkan scenario will play out first in California and the Southwest states. Whites from this region will flee to the Pacific Northwest or into the Midwest. After this who knows? If the numbers of Aztecs and Incas reaches a tipping point and they declare an independent Atzlan or reattachment to Mexico, it is just possible that the sheeple will bleat in anger and the Civil War 2 will begin. But most will just accept it or let themselves be convinced how great it is. Sorry to be so gloomy. </p>

		<p>If the data below on the under-five population is accurate, the &#8220;tipping point&#8221; for minority status for whites in the U. S. has probably already been reached for newborns:</p>
<p>See &#8220;Census Bureau Estimates Nearly Half of Children Under Age 5 are Minorities,&#8221; May 14, 2009:<br>
https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/013733.html </p>
<p>KEY EXCERPT: &#8220;The U.S. Census Bureau today released national population estimates showing that our nation is becoming older and more racially and ethnically diverse. The estimates found that nearly half (47 percent) of the nation&rsquo;s children younger than five were a minority in 2008, with 25 percent being Hispanic. For all children under 18, 44 percent were a minority and 22 percent were Hispanic.&#8221; </p>

		<p>It will be fun to watch how the children of white liberals will be treated when they are the minority under a hostile, hateful non white majority. These white victims will be the worst racists in history, and they will hate their parents for facilitating the destruction of the country that was supposed to be theirs and can no longer protect them from the evil dark night. Their horrors and sufferings will make them also the most vital of all whites, akin to the Boers of South Africa. </p>

		<p>When whites become the minority in America, it&rsquo;s over for not just America but also whites in general. I lived in Vancouver, Canada&rsquo;s third largest city, which was overtaken by Hong Kong immigrants. And the scorn and racial contempt that they displayed for white persons (and also those of other races) was shocking. You couldn&rsquo;t pay me enough to return to Vancouver, despite that city&rsquo;s beautiful natural setting.</p>
<p>The simple truth is that while whites bend over backwards to help non-whites, non-whites will never treat a minority white population with any respect whatsoever. And as whites become a minority, so too will America&rsquo;s economy tank even further. Which will, of course, cause non-whites to develop an even more intense hatred of whites for having &#8216;caused it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a choice of either fleeing or fighting back with an iron-clad determination to win. The current status quo, &#8216;tolerance&rsquo;, won&rsquo;t be a viable option.<br>

		<p>I always have to take these stories with a grain of salt.  It is kind of like a ballplayer who starts out great, hitting alot of home runs.  The media will immediately come up with statistics like, &#8220;if he keeps this pace, he will break the record by 20XX&#8221;</p>
<p>This could happen if everything is status quo, but things change.  If there is a complete economic collapse, a new civil war, a natural or man made disaster, things will be different.  Hisanics will high tail it out of the US once the free money is gone, and there are several ways it can be disrupted.</p>
<p>I agree with ice.  Articles like this are psyop pieces intended to make the White population feel doomed, roll over and die off.</p>

<p>Also, &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; comes from &#8220;Hispania,&#8221; which was the Roman name for Spain.  Spanish people are white and European.  &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are NOT swamping the United States; black and brown non-Europeans are.</p>

		<p>Although this is a disturbing article, it&rsquo;s heartening to read such level-headed comments here from people in the US and Canada that us Australians have so much affinity with.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, us whites are a weird bunch, overall.  I work in a conservative profession, and when I raise any comments regarding the ethnic fracturing of my home city of Sydney (and the rest of Australia for that matter), it is as though I&rsquo;m worse than any criminal around for mentioning such &#8216;racist&rsquo; things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when the ethnic majority &#8216;tipping point&rsquo; in Australia is predicted, however, in Sydney it has become claustrophobic, with ethnic &#8216;tribes&rsquo; creating a city totally unrecognisable from my childhood/youth in the 1970s.<br>
Yesterday in Sydney, a bus driver wearing a Santa Claus hat was savagely attacked by three Middle Eastern youths in broad daylight. <br>
 <br>
The police here are hopelessly outnumbered against the rising crime perpetrated by Middle Easterners, Pacific Islanders, Aboriginals, South-East Asians, and (we have a new crime wave region of origin) - Sudanese and Somalians.  </p>
<p>Best wishes to my like-minded comrades in North America and all western nations.  Please remain strong.   </p>

<p>NEW ORLEANS&hellip;.What a hellhole it is. An earlier post stated about how the &#8220;whitebread&#8221; whites will always support immigration and diversity because they&rsquo;ve never seen it; this is so right. I can&rsquo;t believe the liberals coming here talking about how wonderful the &#8220;culture&#8221; in New Orleans is. They haven&rsquo;t a clue. </p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS is a good example of what the rest of the country will turn into. </p>

<p>After more than 40 years of nonstop immigration of their peoples into this country, I&rsquo;d have to say their track record is unimpressive so far.

		<p>We can only hope that the pendulum has been pushed so far that it&rsquo;s ready to swing back.  A recent poll shows that Americans&rsquo; approval of the Tea Party movement is significantly higher than that accorded the two major parties.  One year of Obama, and people are (peacefully so far) taking to the streets.  If more people had just voted in the last Presidential election, we probably wouldn&rsquo;t have Obama in the White House now.  What is being babbled by the MSM bears little resemblance to what is said in the hinterlands, and white Americans are not likely to just keep taking it.</p>

		<p>This is why I oppose the maratorium nonsense that Peter Brimelow is pushing. Why would you want to ever bring non-white immigration levels back up again.</p>
<p>Pushing moratorium is an attempt not ot look &#8220;extreme&#8221; when lobbying &#8220;conservstive&#8221; White Republican cngressaman and Senators. Peter Brimelow is trying to save the evil Republican party.</p>
<p>My view of the mattr is this:Amnesty is ineveitable. It is just a question of whether it is tactically better to have it passed now or when the nonwhite population is much bigger. </p>
<p>If Amnesty is passed now-when NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERIACANS are a much biggger percentage of the US population-there will be enough of US to rebel-a complete racialist revolt-that will shut down amnesty,strip away American citizenship to the recent beneficiares of amnesty,shut down all LEGAL immigration to 0 and deport the hispanic,asian,muslim and african fifth columns.</p>
<p>But in order fo this to happen, millions of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS have to be hit with a catastrophic event&hellip;and the event will be amnesty&hellip;for if amnesty is passed-overnight- the immigration enthusiast and post-1965 nonwhites will start taunting-viciously-NATIVE BORN WHITE MALES&hellip;and shortly after that, enact polices to economically and socially disenfranchise millions of NATIVE BORN WHITE MALES. The football stadiums and basketball arenas will empty out. WHITE NATIONALISM will be the only game in town..and it won&rsquo;t be a spectators sport.  The donations to numbersusa.com will dry up. The passage of amnesty is the cataclysmic even needed to wake up millions of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>

		<p>Well, the fact that the census acknowledges that immigration has a lot to do with it speaks volumes; The &#8220;elephant in the room&#8221; is the fact that our current immigration laws are racist and discriminatory against Europeans, and have been since 1968, when the 1965 Hart-Celler Act was fully put into play.

		<p>The projection for 2050 is just pure hogwash.  There are &#8220;probably&#8221; at least 25,000,000 illegal Mexicans in this country right now and possibly more.  There is no sign that the government wants to deport these people; on the contrary they&rsquo;re pushing for amnesty.  They&rsquo;re living here and working here.  If we assume the 25,000,000 figure to be accurate and add 25,000,000 to 308,000,000 we get 333,000,000 people here right now.  Non-Hispanics Whites comprise about 200,000,000.  That make us 60% of the population according to my calculator.  In the mid-1960&rsquo;s we were approximately 90% of the population.  It took about 45 years for &#8220;our&#8221; percentage to drop about 30%.  This illegal - and also legal - immigration time bomb took almost 25 years before it was in full gear.  It is now in full gear.  It is not - repeat not - going to take 40 years for &#8220;our&#8221; percentage to drop a mere 10%; it&rsquo;s going to be a lot faster than that if current trends continue.  I must agree with Russ on number 18 according to NumbersUSA.  They&rsquo;re the ones that have it right.  Our minority status is about 15 years down the road.  I must disagree with number 20, I don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re attempting to make us feel doomed and roll over and die off by telling us we have more time than we do, I mean they certainly want us to roll over and die off, but I think that they&rsquo;re attempting to lull us into a false sense of security by making us think we have more time than we do, the rationale being something akin to, &#8220;Oh just relax you have plenty of time&#8221;.  When we&rsquo;re in that frame of mind we&rsquo;re less likely to want to do anything, and by the time that we do it&rsquo;ll be too late - this is what &#8220;they&#8221; want.</p>

		<p>Non-Hispanic whites are two-thirds of the population at the moment? I kind of find that hard to belive. Just a few years ago, the census bureau said that Non-Hispanic whites would be just under sixty five (65) percent of the population in 2010, and we are now less than one month away from the new year. And people are right to point out the bureau&rsquo;s dubious practice of considering middle-easterners &#8220;white.&#8221; Although, Anonymous from 6:16 PM on December 16 has over estimated the Arab segment of the &#8220;white&#8221; American population. According to an article on Wikipedia, Arabs are just over one (1) percent of the US population, a majority of whom belong to the Christian religion.

		<p>The news media writes this stuff up as if it is un-stoppable!  This is wrong.  We can and must stop this.  Any country in the world that basically has an open border like we do now, and offers all of the benefits that we offer to illegal aliens would soon be swamped by newcomers   &mdash;  - just like we are being swamped.</p>
<p>How do we put an end to this madness?<br>
Affirmative Action - Get rid of this program now!  Get the government out of the day to day hiring practices of business</p>
<p>Anchor Babies - Make it clear that children born to two illegal parents, are themselves illegal.</p>
<p>Illegal Immigrants - Get them out of here.  No more benefits for them.  Enforce the laws that we have now and they will all voluntarily leave.</p>
<p>Legal Immigration - Slow this to a trickle.  Have, almost, a 100% moratorium on legal immigration.  Maybe even make this permanent.  We&rsquo;ve got enough people in the USA now.  While immigration was great for the country in the past, times have changed and that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>Some of you have asked what happens if 2050 comes and the whites are a minority   &mdash;   Here is my vision of WHAT IS NEXT:<br>
We become more and more like South Africa.  Whites continue to be discriminated against via Affirmative Action.  The new majorities are going to say that if they were stupid enough to have enacted such a policy in the first place that they weren&rsquo;t going to change it!&hellip;Violent crime will explode out of control&hellip;Whites will only be safe in a few areas in the country: enclaves with walls and barbed wire around it and armed guards patrolling the perimeter.</p>
<p>So there you have it:  The country and us whites can just accept our fate and do nothing and our descendants will live in the third world, or choice number two is to stop almost all immigration, and keep this nightmare from occurring!</p>

		<p>  Honestly, I think 2050 is only a guess. Whites are already a minority in several states: California, Hawaii, New Mexico and Texas. I suspect our government doesn&rsquo;t have an accurate count of the number of non white minorities. In the immediate future, whites will probably be concentrated in New England and the Upper Midwest. However, the minorities will always follow whites  &mdash;  as Chris Rock said, even to Mars. If I were twenty years younger, I&rsquo;d move to Eastern Europe, but I&rsquo;m too old and an old tree can&rsquo;t be transplanted to new soil.

		<p>Long before we reach mid 21st century, America will resemble a<br>

and trusted middle class that will keep their jobs by being<br>
loyal, and trusted by the wealthy elite, They will be the Arm Forces, and the Police. And the third class, will be the very poor whom will have no rights, and are treated as slaves, and very much abused. This is the way in every third world society, and be be true for America long before 2050.  This is what is called unintentional consequences.<br>
A society can only survive long periods of time is by a educated,<br>
informed,and thriving middle class. They  would put a check on corruption, and and keep the government from falling into a cabal that will lead to the eventual destruction of that society.  This is why the ruling elite have spent three generations in dumbing down the populace through the constant propaganda through the media, schools, and the government. The populace are not aware of the dangers coming upon them, and their children. This is why the ruling elite, to destroy all<br>
opposition must reduce the educated, and the informed classes<br>
Even thought, the ruling class is mostly white, they see their<br>
own people as a threat to their rule, and must be reduced to<br>
a manageable level. Their goal is to convert all western<br>
nations to third world status, and use that to punish anyone<br>
whom gets out of line, and tries any serious opposition.<br>

&#8220;If you question the desirability of America becoming a white minority nation, you are a racist Ku Klux Nazi. The only way to be a good American today is to be either ambivalent or outright supportive of the black-brown takeover of your country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever helps us overcome our prejudices and outdated beliefs should be embraced as we move America forward to a more inclusive and tolerant nation. We should live up to our responsibility of becoming more contributory members of the world community. Through appreciation of other cultures, and with  sensitivity to those whom we have oppressed and marginalized, we can transcend our past and make a better future for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity is our strength, and we pledge to overcome our white privilege through valuing all people, not just those who look like us. We pledge to hold ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned white privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whenever you hear a white person talk like that, you have a moral and ethical right to depose them on their personal choices: What are the percentages of non whites in your neighborhood, at your children&rsquo;s school, at your church or synagogue, and at your job, and of your doctors?</p>
<p>If they have made personal decisions to keep themselves away from neighborhoods, schools, churches, synagogues, jobs, and doctor&rsquo;s offices where would be the minority, then you have a racist hypocrite on your hands. You can call them out on it and be fully within your progressive rights to harass, humiliate, and intimidate them.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Under a purely theoretical &lsquo;zero immigration&rsquo; scenario in which the U.S. effectively does not take in any immigrants, whites would remain the majority in 2050, making up a solid 58 percent of the U.S. population. In such a case, the share of Hispanics would increase to 21 percent because of high fertility rates and a younger population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is what I will never understand, why &ldquo;zero immigration&rdquo; is never considered as anything beyond a &ldquo;theoretical scenario.&rdquo; That is pure hogwash, as far as I am concerned; it isn&rsquo;t just a &ldquo;&ldquo;theoretical scenario,&rdquo; it is the only plausible scenario for the survival of the United States. We are overpopulated by about 50 million people as things now stand, and that isn&rsquo;t even considering the 25 to 30 million &ldquo;undocumented immigrants&rdquo; that we have been invaded by. What has this gotten us, besides a mulatto &ldquo;savior&rdquo; and economic chaos? </p>
<p>The answer is nothing: no &ldquo;enrichment,&rdquo; no &ldquo;strength through diversity,&ldquo; and no &ldquo;utopia.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Frankly, I think that a United States that is only 58% white is intolerable; the USA at a minimum should 75% white, and at best, at least 85% white or greater. Our population should ideally be about between 245 to 257 million maximum, that is what we can accommodate comfortably, without excessive socioeconomic stress or environmental deterioration. If that means throwing out all illegal aliens and rescinding all past amnesties handed out to &ldquo;former&rdquo; invaders and their descendents by way of unconstitutional fiats, then so be it. If it also means racially based tax incentives to encourage white birthrates and discourage those of nonwhites; again, so be it!</p>
<p>I agree with those who feel that this issue of &ldquo;inevitability&rdquo; and white minority &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; is not just nonsense, but despondency propaganda aimed at forcing our bewildered apathy of altruism, into an outright auto-genocide. </p>

<p>Jan maybe your not familiar with our Census but race here is reported by a person&rsquo;s self identication not what they are genetically.  Most of our Spanish speaking populations come from Latin America and the Carribbean, not Europe.  At least two-thirds of them are not White but mixed race people with brown skin, jet black hair and Indian features (Aztec not dothead).  I&rsquo;ve known co-workers who were latino (I don&rsquo;t like to use the word hispanic because it means &#8220;from Spain&#8221;) and considered themselves White but no one White would seriously consider them as such.  It would be a tragedy if European Americans intermarried with these people in large numbers because their children would be mixed race as well.  I don&rsquo;t mean to criticize our White Hispanic friends either but I wonder if assimilation is even possible because of the different cultures.  I&rsquo;ve been to Miami, which is home to probably the largest concentration of White Cuban Hispanics in America.  I don&rsquo;t see alot of assimiliation going on despite the fact they&rsquo;ve been in the country for 50 years and are economically successful.  Most non-hispanic Whites have left the area and Spanish is the defacto language of choice and the street signs in English have long been taken down.     </p>

		<p>We can be the majority forever if we stick together and fight against those who harm us.  Have more children.  If we can force politicians to balance the budget then we can throw the country into chaos.  This will benefit the white people because it will ensure that we will not have the money to pay illegals and they will be forced to go home.  It will ensure the african welfarists who enslave the rest of us will either stop having babies out of wedlock or starve to death.  We have gotten ourselves into this mess by out of control spending.  Keep yelling at the top of your lungs to send the foreigner home!  And keep yelling at the top of your lungs for the african to stop killing us.  Keep yelling at the top of your lungs for our brothers and sisters to buy arms and actively support the 2nd amendment.  </p>

<p>I beg to differ; only a miniscule fraction of US Hispanics are &#8220;whites&#8221;.  The overwhelming majority are the direct descendants of degenerate Mexican and Latin American Indians who practiced cannibalism and human sacrifice for millenniums.  The universal Hispanic propensity for crime and corruption confirms that the current generation has inherited their ancestor&rsquo;s total lack of morality&hellip;  </p>

		<p>Hello from Europe - </p>
<p>In my experiences East Asians tend to look down on those not of an equal wealth status (and these days many who migrate to the US, Canada, and Australia are wealthy). They get a kick out of it, gives them a bit of a power trip. To them, wealth is the sole measure of a person. Hence they look down on brown and blacks the most, but also if you are, say, an electrician and go to do work for them, they&rsquo;ll look down their nose at you because you&rsquo;re a &#8216;mere&rsquo; labourer who doesn&rsquo;t sit around in air-conditioned comfort like they do all day. This all comes from their societal attitudes thousands of years old. My old man used to tell me he frequently got that attitude when he had jobs at Asian businesses, and almost walked out on them a few times.</p>
<p>Those not in a higher wealth bracket are ok I find, but very cliquey. They stick to their own - their own neighbourhoods and communities, and they try to keep business amongst themselves where they can. While I don&rsquo;t find them as bad as other minority groups, I think they pose enough of a threat to whites, perhaps in different ways though.</p>

<p>Shut all nonwhite LEGAL IMMIGRATION down permanently. For Brimelow to be pushing an amnesty shows that he doesn&rsquo;t fully appreciate how dire the demographic situation is for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.Brimelow like Sailer would probably like to keep the asian LEGAL IMMIGRATION spigot on becuase they are so &#8220;intelligent&#8221;. After all, the IQ tests are irrefutable proof of this.</p>

		<p>I agree with some posters on here.  We can&rsquo;t predict the future and assume in 40 years we will all be a minority and that we won&rsquo;t gain a racial backbone and that whites won&rsquo;t have more kids.  Not all predictions turn out to be accurate.  Like 1965, Teddy Kennedy said that immigration from then on out wouldn&rsquo;t change the racial makeup of America.  Well, he wrong, wasn&rsquo;t he?  Most people thought electing Obama would be a good thing, well they were wrong, weren&rsquo;t they?  See my point?</p>

		<p>Mistake:I meant to say that Peter Brimelow is pushing a moratorium. The moratorium argument is strictly an economic argument and a very bad one at that.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue is the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. A moratoreum won&rsquo;t prevent this from happening. I am challeinging Peter Brimelow to come clean on this issue. For Brimelow. it is all about saving the evil Republican party.</p>
<p>The moratorium rallying cry concedes way too much of the economic argument to the treasonous immigration enthusiasts. An immigration moratorium means bringing back up post-1965 non-white LEGAL IMMIGRATION as soon as labor markets tighten up-labor scarcitie in other words. But why would a severe labor scarcity be so terrible for economic reasons? Do not give me the Alan Greenspan nonesense about inflation Peter.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, the battle against the race-replacement of the NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS requires a severe labor scarcity. The moratorium is a strategy whereby immigration reformers sit down at the negotiating with  groups who  thoroughly hate NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS&hellip;groups  such as the hispanic caucus,asian caucus and black caucus, the India policy group in the &#8220;US&#8221; congress(why hasn&rsquo;t this group been written about  on vdare.com?)</p>
<p>Let the Republican party croak Peter Brimelow.</p>

		<p> We fought WW2 with only 126 million . When I was born the US population was about 155 million . When I went in the service at the age of 19 the US population was just over 200 million . Eight years later the US achieved zero population growth . The liberals totally freaked . Who will run the motels, convenience stores, where will we get doctors and other professionals ? Jobs were for the taking . Even pop songs like &#8220;Take This Job and Shove It,&#8221; reflected the easy availability of jobs . Perhaps it was the wrong attitude but it shows that jobs were somewhat easy to come by.Now there are no jobs, the convenience store and motel operators and our doctors do not look like us and I doubt they really have the same core values that we do . We were not asked if this is what we wanted and we certainly did not get to vote on it . Ted Kennedy said the Immigration Bill of 1965&rsquo;s effect on us would be negligible, obviously he was either wrong or just plain lying one . We&rsquo;ve lost our country . Nothing short of a miracle will save our white hides .    </p>

Teddy wasn&rsquo;t wrong! You&rsquo;ve simply misunderstood the message. When he said &#8220;America&#8221;, he was referring to his fortress like compound in Hyannisport. On my recent trip to the Cape last summer I noticed quite a bit of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and I&rsquo;m not speaking of Indians nor Koreans. Nowahm Sain?<br>
There was high profile rape/muder of a woman either on the Cape or one of the Islands two or three years ago and guess what the perpetrator was.<br>
a. Swedish<br>
b. Swiss<br>
c. Lubavitcher Hassidic <br>
d. Unitarian<br>
e. Tibetan Bhuddist<br>

		<p>Dear Hope Yen,<br>
I assume by your surname that you are of North Asian Heritage. When White people disappear from North America, you Asians will be the next target for the Blacks and the Browns.  They hate you just as much. You were &#8220;The Buddah Heads&#8221; against whom &#8220;Football&#8221; Willliams was exhorting the other rioters to proceed. <br>
You might want to read the article on South Philadelphia High School were there has been an ongoing campaign of assaults against Asian students by Black thugs ( excuse the redundancy).</p>

		<p>65 Anon: I think that the idea that a capable electrician or machinist or seamstress is in any way equal to a professor or a rich man is entirely American.  Even here, I think that most college grads believe themselves to be intrinsically superior to skilled workers.  As a former tradesman, it was my experience that engineers and scientists were much more likely than people with degrees in the humanities to judge you by your mind, rather than your credentials or wallet.  If White Americans indoctrinated in equality look down on working people, I&rsquo;m not about to believe that anyone from a country that still has a peasant class will respect us.  I had a little contact with Asians when I was a workingman, and the Hindus and Moslems I dealt with couldn&rsquo;t hide their contempt.  I was also aware that Chinese machinists were generally worthless.  I took that to mean that no intelligent Chinese in America would stoop to doing that kind of work, that honest, productive, demanding labor carried no status among them, as it does among many Whites.  Importing any kind of Asians to this country is just bringing in a class of would-be overlords.  </p>

		<p>The advantage to being a &#8220;lowly electrician&#8221; is that I can charge these &#8220;uppity college types&#8221; a PREMIUM for them being jerks.<br>
Anyone who discounts the worth of a skilled tradesman is a FOOL, especially when the &#8220;anointed ones&#8221; need their skills.</p>
