<h1><a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB125980636539574013.html">Major Gets 171⁄2 Years in Iraq Contract Case</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joel Millman, Wall Street Journal, December 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former Army major was sentenced to a 171⁄2-year prison term on corruption charges in Wednesday in San Antonio, signaling the beginning of the end of a far-reaching Iraq War corruption probe.</p>
<p>As part of the probe, a growing cadre of career soldiers has confessed to siphoning millions of dollars from defense contracts in Iraq and Kuwait. The investigation into their spree already has led to the indictments of five U.S. military officers, with another dozen expected to follow.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge W. Royal Furgeson&rsquo;s order that former Maj. John Cockerham pay $9.6 million in restitution  &mdash;  money federal investigators say he collected from steering contracts to favored suppliers  &mdash;  speaks to the breadth of the conspiracy, which allegedly lasted for years as officers rotated in and out of the war zone. Mr. Cockerham, the ringleader, and his co-conspirators allegedly installed replacement officers to work as bag men in their absence. They expected the bag men to collect as much as $5.4 million in kickbacks from contracts worth over $110 million, according to court documents.</p>
<p>So far, three former Army majors and one lieutenant colonel have pleaded guilty to money-laundering, bribery and other charges. Another major is awaiting trial, while sentencing of former Maj. Christopher Murray is slated to occur in Georgia in two weeks.</p>
<p>Two others have entered not-guilty pleas. A Justice Department spokeswoman says former Sgt. Terry Hall and Maj. Eddie Pressley are due to go on trial in April.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unlike the allegations of violence that dogged security contractor Blackwater USA, the case of the Cockerham crew spools out more like Sidney Lumet&rsquo;s films about corruption in big-city police departments. Bribes and kickbacks allegedly involved relatively routine contracts to provide drinking water, laundry and latrine services to military bases, awarded by a small group of officers who seemed to be barely supervised by senior officers.</p>
<p>Almost every suspect comes from the same background: African-Americans who rose from childhood poverty to successful military careers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since then [December 2006], reams of court documents from overlapping cases reveal a pattern of corruption. Army contracting officers, almost all of them African Americans, reached out to African-American businessmen, seeking bribes in exchange for contracting deals.</p>
<p>By the time investigators were closing in, the Cockerham scheme allegedly had spread to new players, minority contractors launched by retired African-American soldiers who already had been vetted by the Pentagon. Maj. Cockerham allegedly hoped to harvest future bribes from them.</p>

		<p>The only reason they had &#8220;successful military careers&#8221; is because the military is affirmative action crazy   &mdash;   if you&rsquo;re black, and can put together two semi-coherent sentences, you&rsquo;re going to rise with in the ranks quickly.</p>

		<p>The word &#8220;Diversity&#8221; derives from differences.  When you have different groups of people, each group will have different ways of doing things, different agendas, and different allegiances.  Only a fool would believe that different groups would &#8220;play by the same rules&#8221; or have similar moral standards.  This is why it is nearly impossible to maintain a society composed of divergent races, ethnicities, religions, or languages.   </p>

		<p> Anyone notice that this story originated from the Wall Street Journal itself, not from the Associated Press? I&rsquo;m willing to bet that the AP will detour around this one like it was a swamp.</p>
<p> Kudos to the Journal for calling a spade a spade   &mdash;   so to speak   &mdash;   by noting that nearly all the suspects were African Americans. Usually in a case like this the news media throws the cloak of anonymity over the issue of race, claiming that it&rsquo;s &#8220;not relevant.&#8221; </p>

<p>One thing that wasn&rsquo;t accurately reported was that not one of these retards was qualified as a truly effective military officer.</p>
<p>I hope the politically correct Pentagon has a lot more of the same in the near future.  They deserve it for putting incompetent blacks in AA leadership positions which will result in white lives being lost.</p>
<p>You know a military organization is dysfunctional when the privates are smarter than the officers. </p>

		<p>Of course their supervisors were not in control of them. Most people are completely unaware of how much being a black officer in the Army insulates you from. To the denigration of the competent black offficers this crew is an aggrogant, strutting chaser of white female soldiers and the first to leave a place of duty at the end of a day. They can often be found right back in the company area fraternizing in the billets. There are many dedicated, efficent black officers but the shiny sweat suit wearing REMFs that predominate destroy all around them.</p>

<p>He may be one to watch. If he has a past history of mentioning race in articles highlighting AfroAmerican crime or AfroAmerican unearned minority race privilege, then he won&rsquo;t last. The association of black journalists will tip off the splc and adl, the witch hunt will start, and he will disappear from public view and relevance.</p>

		<p>Its funny how the low lying fruit always get plucked so easily. </p>
<p>As per Paul Bremers testimony in front of Congress. He was given a total of 14 Billion dollars in cash, and couldnt provide one line of accounting as to where one penny went.<br>
 <br>
14 Billion dollars just vanished without any documentation what so ever. And no one investigates him and his cronies. Amazing what political connections will get you. </p>
<p>Regardless of race, this poor sap just didnt have the right connections inside the beltway.</p>

		<p>I learned the hard way during a long career in owning several new car dealerships that it&rsquo;s highly imprudent to employ blacks in any position which allows them to handle money or gives them access to small and readily fenced items such as parts and accessories.</p>
<p>Most dealers I knew made the same observation, and at least one of them lost a fair amount of money to an embezzlement scheme run by a long-time and trusted employee.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this behavior results from any particular desire to &#8220;stick it whitey.&#8221;  Given the opportunity, all too many blacks will steal from anybody, whether the employer is black, white, indulgent and generous (seemingly the most likely victim) or tyrannical and suspicious by nature.</p>
<p>Given the overall statistical evidence of black African criminality in this and other nations, these observations seem consistent with the general reality.<br>

		<p>I won&rsquo;t hold my breath that Hollywood will do a movie version starring the current senior black movie stars.  They&rsquo;re too busy making them out as the moral heroes in contemporary film.</p>
<p>In fact, I can&rsquo;t even recall any contemporary art about corruption among privileged blacks.  </p>
<p>This story will not become salient in the public consciousness, it will disappear under the barrage of media and entertainment propaganda about blacks which beguiles the masses.</p>

		<p>tens of billions of dollars went AWOL in Iraq, so this isn&rsquo;t even the tip of the iceberg - more like a snowflake on a glacier. </p>
<p>prepare to see plenty of officers of all colors go to jail for stealing billions during during this TRILLION dollar war.</p>

		<p>Virtually all Blacks think that this is the way you are suppose to behave when in power. It is endemic in Black politicians. Blacks think that they are being worldly and sophistcated when using power to enrich themselves.When they are caught the Black community will say they just got caught because they were Black. With full satisfaction in their own heads that they are no worse than Whites in power. Because to faceup to reality is just too painful.</p>
<p>Note of encouragement. That this article was written and that it pointed out the race of the offenders.</p>

		<p>Years ago, I was told by a StoreKeeper (Navy Supply person), that Supply Officers are the most likely ones to end up being booted out or imprisoned for misconduct in their position. Supply is a field that tends to over-represent women and minorities in the military. </p>
<p>To give credit where credit is due, I&rsquo;m glad that Mr. Millman had the stones to place the blame on those who committed these crimes. Unfortunately, he is probably going to be shipped off to the memory hole in the near future.   </p>

		<p>Posters 7 &amp; 14: Millman is not responsible for this article, the WSJ is, or more specifically, its editors are.  Remember a couple years ago when William Salesian (?) wrote a couple articles on racial differences in intelligence for Slate, that were posted here?  After the first one he got a big public spanking from his editor, groveled and promised not to do it again.  Six months later he wrote another, got another spanking, and groveled some more.  The point is, the MSM know the score.  They are trained reporters.  Even though they are corrupt, they know as much or more as most of us here.  Thinking traitors would love to be rid of the Black millstones around their necks.  Imagine how hard it is to come up with these endless excuses to justify Black shortcomings.  The DNA people are beginning to confirm what the IQ people have been saying about Blacks for years, and the word will be getting around.  The Hispanics and Orientals are not nearly so embarrassing as Blacks, are increasing more rapidly than Blacks, and don&rsquo;t like Blacks themselves.  Essentially, the more thoughtful multi-culti Whites want to dump the Blacks before they are dragged down with them.  The Blacks have served their purpose, but the Reds have a better sort of minority to use against us now.  Mr Millman wrote this article under the orders of his bosses, it takes no courage at all.  </p>

<p>I think Schoolteacher is onto something here.  I too was astonisted at the openness with which reporter Joel Millman defined the perps in this case. This was extraordinary. But is it an accident?  Mr. Millman doesn&rsquo;t know the rules?   </p>
<p>Like something too good to be true, I was suspicious of it.    It just isn&rsquo;t &#8220;normal&#8221;  reportage for a MSM publication like the WSJ to reveal such info.  Hence, I have to wonder what they&rsquo;re really up to. I have no idea what it is, but I do know that, normally, something like this would never be allowed to slip through, much less reiterated several times, as it was.  Very fishy!</p>
