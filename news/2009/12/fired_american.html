<h1><a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/12/fired-american-apparel-workers-to-get-benefits-of-sale-.html">Fired American Apparel Workers to Get Benefits of Sale</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, December 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It was a holiday sale for a singular group of beneficiaries  &mdash;  illegal immigrants who had been thrown out of work.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me feel less guilty for buying all this stuff,&#8221; said Dolores Arellano, 19, one of more than 1,000 shoppers who thronged Saturday to the parking lot of American Apparel in downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The trendy, L.A.-based clothier sponsored the &#8220;Justice for Immigrants&#8221; event to benefit some 1,600 employees let go in recent months after federal inspections uncovered discrepancies in their immigration documentation.</p>
<p>All the proceeds from the sale will go to the families of the dismissed workers and to organizations representing immigrants, said Peter Schey, an attorney for American Apparel in the immigration case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pre-Christmas sale featured discounts of up to 85% on shirts, sweaters, dresses and sundry other items. The crowd was larger than expected, and workers were constantly carting in boxes of new clothing to be placed on racks and bins spread across the parking lot, flea-market style. Some shoppers waited more than an hour to get in; later, they faced a half-hour wait to pay. The policy was cash only, no returns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the Obama administration has mostly ended the high-profile work-site immigration raids endorsed by the Bush White House, it has stepped up federal document audits of companies and workers. Firms found to have workers whose documentation does not match official records may be subject to sanctions if they don&rsquo;t act.</p>
<p>Supporters call the audits a humane way to enforce immigration law, without the disruption of raids. But critics call the audits inhumane &#8220;desktop raids&#8221; that still force low-income immigrants out of work.</p>

		<p>So many things about this story make me want to comment. I live near downtown LA where American Apparel&rsquo;s warehouses are located, and AmRen readers would be disgusted by the large, billboard-sized propaganda slogans plastered on the side of their buildings calling for &#8220;Immigration Reform&#8221; i.e. amnesty.</p>
<p>Next, AA&rsquo;s attempt to produce &#8220;American-made, sweatshop-free&#8221; clothing is nothing but a bad joke when you consider how much of their workforce was illegal (up until recently, that is). Add to this the outrageous average price of their clothes (we&rsquo;re talking $20 for a single, plain, one color cotton t-shirt), and AA&rsquo;s &#8220;consumer and worker friendly&#8221; shtick reeks of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Finally, if anyone wants to look behind the curtain of American Apparel, read up on CEO Dov Charney. A repulsive degenerate by anyone&rsquo;s standards, subject of multiple sexual harassment lawsuits, the guy&rsquo;s character further diminishes AA&rsquo;s standing in my opinion. The company&rsquo;s nothing but hype - don&rsquo;t buy from them.</p>

<p>His website is highly supportive of the destruction of white America. </p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t win this war. There are too many race traitors out there. We had a sense of Volk once, but no longer. The tide has turned against us. Our own people have turned against us. There is simply too much money to be had with cheap, imported labor for the rest of us to have a chance in the labor force. First it was slaves, then came southern and east Europeans. Now it&rsquo;s Hispanics, Asians, Indians, and Africans. We whites end up fighting each other for a shrinking piece of the pie.<br>
The country I grew up in has irrevocably changed for the worse. The death knell has sounded. There are damned few places left to run. The white male is endangered, imperilled. My children may have a chance, but my grandchildren won&rsquo;t.<br>
It&rsquo;s all over. We&rsquo;ve been betrayed by both liberals and conservatives who are motivated by guilt on the one hand and by greed on the other.<br>
It&rsquo;s time to make peace with God<br>

<p>Right on brother, maybe in His infinite wisdom he will allow some of us to survive, if we have learned from our mistakes.</p>

No, it is time to CRY out to God to save HIS people (Christians) once again&hellip;if we do not repent our enemies will continue to rule over us as the Bible states.</p>

<p>Uh-huh.  I&rsquo;m willing to bet that said workers and organizations actually believe that one as much as Schey has the balls to say it.</p>

		<p>I believe we are being punished for our nations&rsquo; sins by losing our White lands to invasion.  The Bible mentions this as a punishment when His people do not obey Him.  Still, I don&rsquo;t think God will let the White race totally disappear.</p>
<p>He has a divine purpose for us, as He does for all the races.  Everything will be sorted out in the end for God&rsquo;s glory.</p>

		<p>I have a much better feeling buying clothing made in Sri Lanka, Mongolia, etc. than I do paying higher prices for the same articles made in the USA by illegal aliens who expect me to pay for their medical care and education for their children.</p>
<p>Last I checked, the Cambodians who made my &#8220;Field &amp; Stream&#8221; shirts were not demanding to live in my neighborhood and claiming Colorado was &#8220;theirs&#8221; all along.<br>
